# Neg---Domain Awareness

### Note

This file is meant to respond to the Domain Awareness aff. It has
answers to both advantages in the starter packet file. On top of that,
it has:

- A DA that argues that increasing the US military advantage,
  particularly with BMD and its ability to detect submarines, would make
  Russia fear that it's nuclear capabilities are insufficient, which
  encourages more aggressive Russian action and nuclear modernization

- A CP that attempts to solve miscalculation through dialogue rather
  than through detection

A good 1nc vs this aff could be:

-Security K

-Strategic Stability DA

-Hotlines CP

-China DA

**[Despite]{.underline}** increasing rhetoric over geopolitical
**[competition]{.underline}** in the Arctic it is still largely agreed
that **[[there is low probability for]{.mark} a [military conflict in
the Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline}** At the same time, one cannot ignore
the rising concerns over military security dynamics and their impact on
the region. Failure to address these concerns increases the likelihood
that relations among Arctic states and with non-Arctic states will
further deteriorate. **[Durable improvements in geopolitical relations
requires a new political framework]{.underline}** that can only be
created by the most senior leaders, something that seems improbable
today. However, **[[there are measures that can]{.mark} contain if not
[reduce]{.mark} emerging [military risks]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The
increase in military activity in the Arctic introduces several risks.
When military forces from different states operate in proximity with one
another there is a risk of accidental collisions or misjudgements that
can lead to a loss of life or serious damage to very expensive
equipment. Military activities can increase the risk to civilian
activities, such as the confusion caused in a commercial fishing fleet
on the sudden arrival of a large Russian naval force conducting an
exercise in the Bering Sea noted above. **[Whenever possible, military
exercises to develop professional competence should be carried out in
uncontested spaces, ideally in locations where sovereign control is
undisputed]{.underline}**. Arctic states could do a lot to develop
professional competence without ever moving beyond their own territory.
It is nevertheless inevitable that some military activities will take
place in more sensitive locations. If such activities are without prior
notification, or if notification provides partial information at a late
stage, it would be a step back to the secrecy that promoted military
planning based on worst case scenarios. Worst-case planning might in
turn promote an action/reaction dynamic that could accelerate the
militarization of the Arctic. The tendency for worst-case planning might
be fostered in the absence of organized frameworks for security dialogue
and military-to-military contacts. **[[A prior notification system to
increase transparency could be established as a politically binding
stand-alone c]{.mark}onfidence- and security-[b]{.mark}uilding
[m]{.mark}easure open to all states that plan military activities in the
Arctic region]{.underline}**. Submarine operations and the military use
of space are of growing importance to Arctic operations, but they are
invisible by their nature. Therefore, the contours of a notification
system for the Arctic would require a focused peer-to-peer military
dialogue to establish tailored reporting requirements based on realistic
expectations of what can be revealed. The increased number of military
activities, and their larger scale, inevitably increases the probability
of accidents or misjudgements. There is a human cost to such incidents.
In August 2019 an accident at a military facility near the White Sea
killed 19 Russian citizens.133 Furthermore, serious environmental damage
could arise from an incident involving, for example, the nuclear
reactors that power some naval vessels. **[The Northern Dimension
Environmental Partnership]{.underline}** (NDEP) **[works to improve the
ecology of the space covering north-west Europe from the Arctic and
Sub-Arctic areas,]{.underline}** including the Barents and White Seas,
to the southern shores of the Baltic Sea. **[A
[dialogue]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[in the framework of NDEP could
build on the work already being carried]{.mark} out by that grouping in
the so-called 'nuclear window]{.underline}**'.134 In a deteriorating
security environment states will continue to invest in the capabilities
they feel they need to safeguard themselves and their allies. However,
**[the potential for military actions to trigger a reaction from
potential adversaries should be factored into their planning. A weak
force]{.underline}** that is not seen as combat credible **[might not
deliver the]{.underline}** intended **[assurance and
deterrence]{.underline}** signal, **[while deploying a robust
force]{.underline}** that could compete militarily against a
sophisticated adversary **[may be seen as a
provocation]{.underline}**---particularly if it is deployed forward in a
crisis. **[[A trans-Atlantic dialogue on the appropriate balance
between]{.underline}]{.mark}**, for example, **[permanent or continuous
[forward presence]{.mark}, on the one hand, [and]{.mark} what can be
termed '[offshore balancing']{.mark}, on the other, [is
needed]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This kind of dialogue can address the
question of what Europeans are willing and able to do militarily as the
centre of gravity as US thinking refocuses on China. In 2018 NATO
leaders endorsed a 'Package for the South' to address security issues in
the Middle East and North Africa coherently, and established a 'Hub for
the South' within NATO's Allied Joint Force Command in Naples to act as
a focal point for the southern dimension, including cooperation with
partners.135 A 'Package for the North' might be timely, along with a
dedicated Hub to provide the necessary support to implementation. The
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has developed frameworks
that might act as an inspiration for Arctic Council initiatives. The
ASEAN states continue to organize a wide range of forums and working
groups in which only members participate. However, they have
supplemented their internal work with an ASEAN Regional Forum where 17
non-members come together with the ASEAN member states to discuss
security issues. ASEAN Plus Three is a forum where ASEAN member states
come together with China, Japan and South Korea to discuss issues of
mutual interest.136 A more inclusive dialogue could be also organized in
the framework of an established event such as the bi-annual Regional
Seapower Symposium (RSS) organized by the Italian Navy. The RSS has
evolved from a meeting of Chiefs of Staff of Black Sea and Mediterranean
navies into a high-level event with global participation to discuss
public order of the oceans. How existing rules apply in the Arctic could
be discussed in a working group convened under the auspices of the
Symposium. One conclusion of this paper is that **[[a
China--Russia--US]{.mark}A [strategic triangle does
exist]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The awareness that each point of this
triangle can cause immense damage to the other two creates a shared
interest in what Thomas Schelling named the 'diplomacy of violence' and
it is also what prompted the Trump Administration to explore the
feasibility of a trilateral arms limitation agreement.137 As one former
US official has noted, 'although the Trump administration mishandled its
diplomatic proposal to include China in US--Russian nuclear arms control
negotiations, its overarching objective of seeking to include China was
strategically sound.'138 **[Of three sides of the strategic
triangle]{.underline}**---China--USA, China--Russia and
USA--Russia---**[detailed consultations only take place along the
China--Russia vecto]{.underline}**r. Discussions among the five
permanent members of the United Nations Security Council have been
proposed as a platform to discuss all issues that affect global
strategic stability. These five states have met multiple times to
discuss nuclear matters, but discussions mainly appear to focus on
technical risk reduction measures. Such measures may be necessary and
useful, but they cannot unlock the political agreement that is a
precondition to reversing the step-by-step increase in the influence of
military factors in global politics. **[[A trilateral strategic dialogue
between the three major military powers could]{.mark} help [achieve a
better understanding of future plans.]{.mark} [A willingness to explain
to the outcome of their deliberations in]{.mark} different regional
settings, including [the Arctic]{.mark}, [could be a valuable first step
towards maintaining the region as one of low tension and effective
cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

#### Confidence-building measures resolve insecurity and prevent conflict

Though the Arctic currently enjoys high levels of co-operation and
stability, **[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}** potential positive **[[effects
of a regional CSBM]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[Confidence-and
Security-Building Measures\] **[regime [should not be
overlooked]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Moreover, existing CSBM regimes
explicitly encourage the adoption of additional regional measures within
their areas of application.30 Drawing from the experiences of the OSCE
\[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\], **[a regional
[CSBM]{.mark} regime [in the Arctic could]{.mark} not only [contribute
to safeguarding]{.mark} the already high levels of [cooperation]{.mark}
but even [further strengthen]{.mark} them, [while]{.mark} also [enabling
a more cooperative approach to military security]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[[It could increase]{.mark} overall levels of [military
transparency]{.mark}, [establish mutual understanding]{.mark} of the
military intentions of the Arctic states, [and provide reassurance about
the defensive nature of military activities]{.mark}, troop deployments,
[and modernization plans]{.mark} for the region.]{.underline}** **[[This
could]{.mark} also [send a strong signal of the Arctic states' full
commitment to i]{.mark}nternational [law]{.mark} [and the peaceful
settlement of disputes]{.mark}, thereby [making an essential
contribution to defusing]{.mark} the [discourse about military
confrontation]{.mark} in the High North]{.underline}**. To conclude,
while the Arctic has so far represented a region of high stability and
co-operation, it does not, despite its apparent remoteness, exist in
isolation from the rest of the world. To protect the already high level
of regional co-operation, **[it might]{.underline}** thus
**[be]{.underline}** **[worthwhile to consider proactive steps to
increase military stability and predictability and to reduce the risk of
unintended military escalation]{.underline}**. Inspiration for this
endeavour could be drawn from the 40 years of experience of the OSCE,
more particularly from its CSBM regimes.

(4-19-2021, "Zoom Won't Stop a Nuclear War," Foreign Policy,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/04/19/zoom-hotline-red-telephone-nuclear-war-cuban-missile-crisis/)

Despite the nearly one dozen hotline links that now exist, [[not all
countries with nuc]{.underline}l]{.mark}ear
weapon[[s]{.underline}]{.mark} [[are linked up at]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
level of **[heads of state]{.mark}**]{.underline} or, in some cases, at
any level. Astonishingly, in an age when any nuclear crisis or conflict
could not be contained with certainty to two states, [[there
are]{.underline}]{.mark} currently [[no **multilateral
comm**]{.underline}]{.mark}unication **[[lines]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[that can be **trusted**]{.underline}]{.mark}. After all, trust is the
issue: trust in the identity of the interlocutor; trust in the system
itself, including its robustness under the most extreme conditions; and
trust in the messages it carries.

In South Asia, where tensions remain high among India, Pakistan, and
China over border disputes, there are no hotlines between the heads of
states of any of these three countries and only limited bilateral ones
at other levels of seniority between India and Pakistan, and, very
recently, India and China. It is unclear if the military and political
bilateral links in this area are reliable or have even been used
consistently in real crises.

The military-operated India-Pakistan hotline established after the 1971
war was seen for decades as "noisy and unreliable with frequent
breakdowns" and thus has not always been used when one would expect. In
February 2021, it was resurrected after a number of years to discuss and
agree to the current cease-fire between the two countries. The problem
with this hotline is that, while it has been tailored to help
de-escalate tensions related to the Line of Control, the issues between
India and Pakistan are much more substantial. On the political side, the
1989 hotline between Indian and Pakistani Prime Ministers Rajiv Gandhi
and Benazir Bhutto, which has been turned on and off multiple times ever
since, and the 2004 nuclear hotline between the Indian and Pakistani
foreign ministers are assumed by experts to be moribund.

When it comes to India and China, a hotline between the Indian Director
General of Military Operations and the Chinese Western Theater Command
was set up only in 2020 after years of protracted discussions. The
Indian and Chinese foreign ministers also agreed to a political hotline
in February of this year. Both were created in the wake of the 2020
border crisis between India and China.

While there is no leader-level hotline between the two nuclear
neighbors, since Narendra Modi became the Indian prime minister in 2014
and until the crisis began last summer he and Chinese President Xi
Jinping met in person at least 18 times. While such levels of personal
engagement are quite rare, threats posed by sophisticated hacking,
spoofing, or even simple voice imitation could even deceive leaders who
have a high level of familiarity with one another. Several radio show
hosts have even managed to talk to various heads of state while
pretending to be a high-profile individual.

The world is increasingly riddled with emerging technologies, such as
artificial intelligence-produced audio or videos known as deepfakes,
that heighten the risk of miscommunication and miscalculation. Even in
cases where leaders such as Modi and Xi are familiar with and maybe even
personally trust one another, interfering technologies, which are
becoming more and more convincing each day, could cast a dark enough
shadow of doubt that existing hotlines would not be trusted. Deepfake
audio is already well advanced and, in one case, was used by hackers to
mimic a CEO's voice to great success.

As demonstrated by the shaky telecommunication quality of the first
India-Pakistan military hotline, there are also technical challenges to
communicating securely over long distances, particularly when the
environment has been degraded by natural disasters, by conflict, or in
the simultaneously worst and most necessary case of a nuclear
detonation.

On top of these physical shortcomings, there is also the constant
hailstorm of official announcements and documents, statements to the
media, and tweets and other social media commentary, generating a great
amount of information, both true and misleading, to filter through. As
such, it is clear that existing communications pathways are not fit for
today's nuclear threat environment, and there is a blatant need for
clarity in nuclear crisis management for the 21st century. A Zoom call
might be adequate for world leaders to exchange pleasantries or insults,
but it is neither assured nor secure enough for sensitive discussions
when at the brink of nuclear war. Nor could it be relied upon in a
degraded communication environment, where cellular networks and the
internet might be down.

Emerging technologies, such as Prompt Global Strike and precision
targeting, hypersonic missiles, and artificial intelligence, are already
quickly changing the nuclear landscape, contributing to an environment
where the potential use of nuclear weapons is more ambiguous and less
easy to anticipate.

Nuclear-armed states are reemphasizing the role of nuclear weapons in
their security doctrines as they engage in modernization efforts and in
some cases are lowering the threshold of potential nuclear retaliation
to include a broader range of significant nonnuclear strategic attacks,
including cyberattacks. As a result, robust communications are critical,
and any new multilateral hotline would have to be made resilient in the
face of hacking; signal interception; firmware, software, and hardware
vulnerabilities; environment degradation; and other threats such as
electromagnetic pulses, which have previously fried satellites. As
technology evolves, the next generation of hotlines must be secured from
new risks and hardened technically.

While currently technically vulnerable, some [[hotlines have been useful
in]{.mark} aiding communications in **complex** and **[hostile
environments]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The [hotlines]{.mark}
[between]{.mark} [the U.S. and Russia]{.mark}n forces in Syria
[proved]{.mark} very [effective in
**deconfliction**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and No]{.underline}rth
[Ko]{.underline}rea [and So]{.underline}uth [Ko]{.underline}rea [operate
numerous hotlines between their militaries, presidential offices, and
the inter-Korean liaison office to deconflict and
communicate]{.underline} on everything from air traffic to maritime
issues. The problem is that while hotlines are difficult to set up and
secure, they are also easy to disconnect and discard, which North Korea
has done in the past, in times of diplomatic spats and increased
tensions.

These **[[existing hotlines are not]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however,
**[[the solution]{.underline}]{.mark}** to dealing with nuclear crises.
[The dangers and complexities of [nuclear crises demand a
**leader-to-leader capability**]{.mark}]{.underline} uniquely
[[dedicated to]{.underline}]{.mark} the avoidance of nuclear detonations
and the rapid **[[de-escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of nuclear
conflict]{.underline} when other efforts have failed.

As nuclear-armed states seek to reduce the risk of nuclear conflict in a
new era of multipolar great-power competition, [rethinking hotlines
should be at the **top of their agenda**]{.underline}. In many ways,
**[[this]{.underline}]{.mark}** is low-hanging fruit that **[[could
serve as the]{.underline}]{.mark}** technical **[[catalyst for expanded
trust and dialogue]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Indeed, France, as the new
chair of the P5 Process, has embraced the concept of "strategic risk
reduction" and will make improving crisis communication technologies
like hotlines a key priority for discussion among the United Nations
Security Council's permanent five members ahead of and beyond the
planned Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty this
August.

In turn, various governmental and nongovernmental voices have made broad
proposals for nuclear-weapons states to consider whether they are
serious about improving the security environment. For example, the 16
countries participating in the Stockholm Initiative have identified a
list of "stepping stones" toward nuclear disarmament, which includes
improving hotlines. At the same time, another coalition of 12 countries
that form the Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Initiative has also
included the need for crisis-proof communication lines in its "landing
zones," or areas of potential agreement, to reduce nuclear risks. The
Global Enterprise to Strengthen Non-Proliferation and Disarmament has
also pointed out that communications links between nuclear weapons
states "are not universal, and those that do exist warrant review."

Our organizations---the Institute for Security and Technology and the
European Leadership Network---are looking at nuclear weapon
decision-making in the face of technological complexity. In particular,
the Institute for Security and Technology team has closely examined
global nuclear command, control, and communications systems and outlined
what an innovative global hotline---dubbed "Catalink"---could look like.
This project has gone beyond the conceptual stage and is ready for
evaluation by the nuclear-armed states. Such an evaluation could be
undertaken without change to their policies, postures, or arsenals, and
it would feature well into their effort to take a more strategic
approach to nuclear risk reduction while tensions rise in conflict zones
across the globe.

Given the very real risks of nuclear escalation through
misinterpretation of rhetoric or actions, or the miscalculation of
responses due to ambiguity and secrecy, **[leaders must have the ability
to speak]{.underline}** clearly, confidently, and
**[confidentially]{.underline}**.

Maintaining stability and preventing nuclear use in an unstable
multipolar world that includes nine nuclear-armed states is impossible
using the bipolar logic and inadequate systems of the Cold War. Modern,
robustly **[[encrypted]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and
**survivable**]{.mark} multilateral
**[comm]{.mark}**]{.underline}unication [[**systems** available to
nuclear decision-makers are needed]{.underline}]{.mark} to face the
perils of the 21st-century nuclear reality. [[Hotlines are due for an
**urgent upgrade**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

**Deconfliction lines create trust and are [resilient]{.underline} to
tensions.**

[[Risk-reduction measures can be **resilient to
tensions**]{.underline}]{.mark}

CBMs have been there for decades, although they have been much less
visible than formal, treaty-based arms control. While some
risk-reduction measures have been part of formal treaties, most of them
have taken the form of political commitments rather than legally binding
agreements. The downside to this lower visibility has been that the
constraints placed on each party's ability to inflict harm on the other
are more easily reversible in the short term.

The upside to this, however, is that this [low visibility has spared
some of those measures the fate of **treaty-based arms
control**]{.underline}, which has not only been more and more criticized
as an instrument of cooperative security, but has become deeply
polarizing on political and ideological grounds. In the US, those
risk-reduction measures have remained largely under the control of the
executive branch and have been less affected by Congress's rejection of
constraints on American power than formal treaties that the Senate has
to ratify. This nonbinding character could have made these measures
short-lived, but most have remained active and implemented -- although
compliance issues did unsurprisingly appear for some of them, such as
the 1975 Helsinki Final Act or the Vienna Document, mostly in relation
to local conflict disconnected from relations between nuclear weapons
possessors. 112

Like other arms-control measures, [risk-reduction measures have been
criticized for being at best naïve and at worst dangerous in creating
misguided expectations of cooperative behavior]{.underline} with
unfaithful adversaries that could thus be better able to cheat and
deceive their faithful counterpart. 113 Efforts to promote transparency
and to establish new channels of communications for crisis prevention
and management were met with skepticism from critics who assumed that
those very channels such as the DCL would be used for deceptive
purposes. 114 [[The track record]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [has
[provided **no ev**]{.mark}**idence** [of]{.mark} such **[attempts to
deceive]{.mark}**. On the contrary, the uses of the DCL have proven the
**value** of this channel of communications to **clarify intent** and
**share info**]{.underline}rmation in times of crisis. [Not only has
there been **no public report** of unfaithful use of the
DCL]{.underline}, either before or after the Cold War ended, [but **on
the contrary** [the DCL]{.mark} seems to have helped to [**create
personal trust** between]{.mark} US and Soviet
[leaders]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Thirty years ago, Colin Gray criticized arms control for being trapped
within a paradox: as an instrument meant to strengthen security, arms
control would presumably not be useful whenever it is achievable (when
the state of political relations allows for an agreement) and not
possible when it might be useful -- when there is deep mistrust and
tensions. 115 The paradox, however, is only true at first sight, and
disappears when one takes a longer-term view to assess the effectiveness
of risk-reduction measures. [[Tensions will]{.mark} continue to
[rise]{.mark} and fall, [but]{.mark}]{.underline} what matters is that
[the **[instruments have remained]{.mark} in place**]{.underline} [[and
kept]{.mark} on]{.underline} **[[delivering]{.underline}]{.mark}** their
effects -- arguably limited -- on **[[stability]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[including during crises]{.underline}. For instance, the patterns of
responsible behavior developed after the signature of the INCSEA
agreement have generally held during times of tensions. 116 More
recently and importantly, [the risk-reduction measures]{.underline}
included in the New START treaty and [in [the]{.mark}]{.underline} 1988
[[agreement on]{.underline}]{.mark} ballistic missile **[[launch
notification]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[have been]{.mark} faithfully
[implemented]{.mark} by both parties]{.underline} -- and **[[even
during]{.underline}]{.mark}** the crisis in
**[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}**, during which the Russian strategic
rocket forces conducted no less than six strategic ballistic missile
launches117 .

The fact that state parties to an agreement continue to take risks and
to exert coercive pressure on each other during crises despite the
existence of the agreement does not mean that the latter has failed. In
fact [it continued to deliver its effects throughout the crises,
lowering the chances that inadvertent escalation would
happen.]{.underline} Risk-reduction measures can help mitigate the most
wide-ranging and dramatic consequences of the security dilemma but
cannot be expected to make instability at the lower level of conflict
wholly disappear.

Political and operational [resilience over time]{.underline}
[is]{.underline} thus [very valuable as it only takes a few years for
political relations to take sudden negative turns]{.underline}. Even if
risk-reduction measures such as CBMs can appear of remote utility when
concluded during a period of relatively low tensions, [their ultimate
value and importance can only appear later on]{.underline}, over the
longer term. One cannot anticipate how the record of compliance with
CBMs will look in the future, but the [[past decades provide
ev]{.underline}]{.mark}idence [[that **nuclear**]{.underline}]{.mark}
weapons [**[possessors]{.mark}** have [benefited]{.mark}
[from]{.mark}]{.underline} the effects of [these [agreements]{.mark}
and]{.underline} that [these measures could still influence their
behavior when it matters most]{.underline}: during major international
crises.

**An [upgraded hotline]{.underline} solves
de-escalation\-\--communication works, Russia says yes.**

**Nadtochey 22**, PhD, associate professor at the Department of World
Politics at MGIMO University. (Yury, 10-27-2022, \"Staying in Touch
During Escalation,\" Fletcher Forum of World Affairs,
http://www.fletcherforum.org/home/2022/10/27/staying-in-touch-during-escalation)

The partial mobilization announced by the Russian authorities and
President Putin's threats to use nuclear weapons against those who
interfere with what he calls a "special military operation" in Ukraine
significantly raise the degree of tensions between Moscow and the West.

[In the face of growing uncertainty]{.underline}, which could bring
Russia and NATO to the edge of a direct clash, [it is time to think
about the means of **prevention**]{.underline}. At first glance, there
are not many of them, but they do exist. The **[communication
[hotlines]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[between]{.mark} the
**[Russia]{.mark}**n military [and **NATO**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
Russian and U.S. decision-makers [[are **crucial**]{.underline}]{.mark}
to this prevention.

Although this tool should not be overestimated, [neglecting it could
turn out to be very costly]{.underline} for both parties. The [[exchange
of info]{.underline}]{.mark}rmation during a conflict
[**[prevents]{.mark}** decision-makers from making
**[miscalc]{.mark}ulations**]{.underline} [[which
could]{.underline}]{.mark} result in
**[[aggravat]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing [the
[conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Disregarding this
principle]{.underline} could be highly risky for the conflicting parties
and [could lead to catastrophic consequences]{.underline}.

Moscow and Washington have long recognized this fact. Since the first
communication hotline was established between the Kremlin and the White
House in 1963, the two superpowers have sought to prevent situations in
which a lack of information could produce misinterpretation of one's
military intentions. Direct communication made it possible to correctly
evaluate the other party's actions. This created predictability and
minimized the probability of a preventive nuclear strike resulting from
a fear of being attacked first.

This principle was long adhered to in the Cold War environment. With
each decade, confidence-building measures in the field of nuclear
weapons use have been improved through the development of new mechanisms
and agreements. As a result, we have a fairly advanced multi-channel
system that facilitates communication between Russian and American
leaders, in contrast to what we had in the early 1960s. However, what
about the possibility of creating hotlines when it comes to conventional
weapons use? Could they provide the same level of confidence as those
established between nuclear forces?

Conventional weapons still play the dominant role in the Russia-Ukraine
War. This weaponry, along with battlefield aircraft and drones, could
easily reach NATO positions in the border areas of Russia and Belarus.
Today, Russian and NATO forces are separated by just a few dozen
kilometers in the areas surrounding the Poland-Belarus border.

Moreover, this issue extends beyond the current conflict between Russia
and Ukraine. It encompasses a broader scope of activities such as
military maneuvers, drills, strategic aviation flights, and the
patrolling of air and sea borders. Are hotlines so effective when it
comes to these activities? The answer is not as clear as it is in the
case of nuclear weapons.

When it comes to the navy or air force, diplomats and the military
cannot boast of such achievements as happened in highly sophisticated
strategic arms control agreements. However, [during the [Cold
War]{.mark}]{.underline}, some [preventive [mechanisms]{.mark} and
agreements were developed]{.underline} in order [to deal
with]{.underline} potentially dangerous [military activities and to
prevent incidents or accidents at sea and in the air. These include
the]{.underline} bilateral U.S.-Soviet Incidents at Sea Agreement
([INCSEA]{.underline}), the Agreement on [Prevention of Incidents on and
over the High Seas]{.underline}, and the Prevention of Dangerous
Military Activities Agreement ([DMA]{.underline}), as well as
multilateral agreements such as the International Regulations for
Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREG).

Unfortunately, [these agreements]{.underline} were not designed to be
real-time risk management tools and therefore [[did not provide stable
communication channels]{.mark} for the rapid exchange of
information]{.underline} among the parties concerned. Moreover, they
proved to be even less effective after the collapse of the Soviet Union
as the geopolitical landscape in Europe had changed dramatically. That
became clear in the 2000s due to NATO enlargement, U.S. military
initiatives (such as America's anti-ballistic missile (ABM)
installations in Poland and Romania), and the renewal of Russia\'s
military activities in Europe and the Atlantic. Long hikes of Russian
warships and military aircraft (including strategic long-range bombers)
became more frequent, producing more encounters and incidents at sea and
in the air with NATO forces.

[[Moscow and NATO]{.mark} members have long worked to solve this
problem, **[achiev]{.mark}**ing [only short-term
successes]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 2002, just one year after the
September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States, the NATO-Russia
Council (NRC) started the so-called Cooperative Airspace Initiative
(CAI). This mechanism was designed to create a more reliable system of
communication and coordination between Russia and NATO in order to
prevent dangerous incidents in the air involving both civilian and
military aircraft. Unfortunately, the initiative was paralyzed with the
suspension of NRC activity in 2014, and timid attempts to revive CAI did
not lead to any substantial results.

But [[does this]{.mark} failure [signal the irrelevance of]{.mark}
communication [hotlines]{.mark}]{.underline}? **[[Not at
all]{.underline}]{.mark}**. One example of a deal that was made in the
aforementioned area is [the Memorandum of Understanding of Air Safety in
[Syria]{.mark}]{.underline}, signed by defense officials in October
2015. Though this accord was only active for a couple of years, it
nevertheless [[turned out]{.mark} to be [an **excellent**]{.mark}
**collision [prevention tool]{.mark}** [that stopped]{.mark} U.S. and
Russian forces from entering]{.underline} into **[[inadvertent
conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Moreover, [the]{.underline}
[memorandum]{.underline} of understanding (MoU) [was a subtle but
effective way of addressing the lack of transparency]{.underline}
between the U.S. and Russian militaries. More importantly, it is
probably the only case in which accords have been developed in order to
reduce the risks of unintentional clashes of warplanes during wartime
conditions rather than in peacetime.

What conclusions can be drawn? Why has the example of cooperation in
Syria been more positive than the multilateral initiative in Europe and
the Euro-Atlantic? One explanation lies in the intentions and
aspirations of the negotiating parties. In Syria, the United States and
Russia sought to prevent accidental collisions in the zones of military
operations. In Europe, neither Russia nor NATO regarded such incidents
as crossing a line which would precipitate a full-fledged military
clash. But [with the escalation of the war in Ukraine, there is clearer
evidence that things could get out of hand]{.underline}. The good news
here is that **[[both the Kremlin and]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** members **[have [signaled]{.mark} their
[readiness to stay in touch]{.mark} with each other]{.underline}** in
order **[to]{.underline}** keep things under control and **[avoid
misinterpretations]{.underline}** or miscalculations of each other's
intentions and actions. Russia raised the issue of management of
dangerous military activity in two so-called "security guarantees"
agreements projects with the U.S.and NATO" drafted in December 2021, but
consultations with the West were doomed to fail. However, on March 1,
2022, just a week after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a de-escalation
military-to-military line was established between the U.S. European
Command in Stuttgart, Germany, and the General Staff of the Armed Forces
of the Russian Federation.

Ultimately, there is no doubt that Moscow and Washington are ready to go
all-in to achieve their goals in Ukraine. That could be a very scary
scenario. [Almost all the confidence-building and [transparency
mechanisms in Europe]{.mark}, either bilateral or multilateral, [were
designed]{.mark} to prevent war, but [not to manage military
activity]{.mark}]{.underline} while cannons speak, and diplomats remain
silent. For the sake of all parties involved in the Russia-Ukraine War,
**[[it is crucial to]{.underline}]{.mark}** develop and **[[implement a
more reliable]{.underline}]{.mark}** and protective **[[communication
arrangement]{.underline}]{.mark}** that can meet the challenge of
wartime conditions.

## Strategic Stability DA

#### The plan upends US-Russian strategic stability---the combination of [submarine detection]{.underline} and [missile defense]{.underline} cause Russian use-or-lose pressures

**Kattan 19**, policy analyst at Science Applications International

The U.S.-Russia relationship is defined by Russian fear of its own
weaknesses (economic, technological, etc.) and paranoia about U.S. and
NATO threats to its security. **[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**
currently **[fears U.S. conventional superiority]{.underline}**20 **[and
has invested in capabilities]{.underline}** and tactics **[to circumvent
it]{.underline}**.21 **[It [is embarking on]{.mark}]{.underline}** a
**[[modernization]{.underline}]{.mark}** program for its nuclear weapons
in part **[[because it feels insecure about]{.mark} the [survivability
of its nuclear forces]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[as the
U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[increases]{.mark} its [progress on b]{.mark}allistic
[m]{.mark}issile [d]{.mark}efense.]{.underline}** **[[If the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[were
able to track Russian]{.mark} nuclear-armed [submarines with increased
confidence]{.mark}, [it could exacerbate]{.mark} these Russian
[fears]{.mark} even [more]{.mark}, [causing Russia to respond in
destabilizing ways]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

While it is true that Russia has never relied as much on submarine-based
weapons as the United States has, **[the [degradation of the
survivability of Russia's nuclear-armed submarines
would]{.mark}]{.underline}** likely **[[cause Russia to
compensate]{.underline}]{.mark}** for this new vulnerability. **[This is
especially true if continued advancements in precision strike make
Russia's air- and land-based nuclear forces more
vulnerable]{.underline}**. If **[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** can no
longer rely on hardening and concealment for survivability, they **[may
[double down on redundancy]{.mark}, producing and [deploying larger
numbers of nuclear weapons]{.mark} to complicate U.S. targeting and
increase the odds that a retaliatory capability survives any U.S. first
strike]{.underline}**. **[[This]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in turn,
**[[could put the final nail in the coffin of arms
control]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[and lead to an arms race]{.mark} with
the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[[that]{.underline}]{.mark}** drains resources, [**[intensifies
mistrust]{.underline}**, **[and makes miscalculation more
likely]{.underline}**]{.mark}. In short, **[[a significant U.S.
advantage in sub]{.mark}marine [detection]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(**[[which]{.mark} [would]{.mark}]{.underline}** likely **[[develop in
parallel with a U.S. advantage in remote sensing]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and precision strike capabilities **[[in other
domains]{.underline}]{.mark}**) **[[would]{.underline}]{.mark}** likely
**[[be destabilizing]{.mark} due to Russian sensitivity over its
technological inferiority]{.underline}**.

**[[This could compel Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** not only
**[[to]{.underline}]{.mark}** increase redundancy with a larger number
of warheads, but to **[[change the doctrine]{.underline}]{.mark}**
governing their use as well. It is possible that **[in an environment of
degraded second-strike stability]{.underline}**, **[[Russia could move
further towards a first-use doctrine to deter escalation and]{.mark} to
[avoid]{.mark} [the "lose them or lose them"
dilemma]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

#### Upending strategic stability causes [extinction-risk]{.underline} arms races, [nuclearization of space]{.underline}, and [drives adversaries together]{.underline} against the US. 

**Kluth 25**, writer at Bloomberg, former Lecturer at the University of
California, Berkeley, MS in International Relations from the London
School of Economics, BA from William's College (Andreas Kluth, May 23,
2025, "A 'Golden Dome' Could Make America Less Safe," Bloomberg,
https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-05-23/a-golden-dome-could-make-america-less-safe)

Start with **[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}** so-called **[[security
dilemma]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[afflicts all]{.mark}
major]{.underline}** (and minor) **[[powers]{.underline}]{.mark}**, with
or without nukes. Hoping to makes itself safer, **[[country A
develops]{.mark} new [defenses,]{.mark} but
[those]{.mark}]{.underline}** defenses in turn **[[make]{.mark} country
[B feel less safe, prompting it to]{.mark}]{.underline}** arm or
**[[escalate]{.mark} and]{.underline}** thereby increase the threat to
country A. At worst, **[both]{.underline}** A and B enter
a **[spiral [toward war that leaves everybody]{.mark}]{.underline}**
more vulnerable, or even **[[dead]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Even short of that, any major new weapons system, offensive or
defensive, is destabilizing. One example was Reagan's SDI. The nuclear
confrontation between the US and the Soviet Union had by the early 1980s
become stable thanks to Mutual Assured Destruction: Both powers were
vulnerable to a first strike by the adversary but also had enough nukes
to answer with a second strike that would obliterate the enemy, so that
each deterred the other.

Star Wars promised (Americans) and threatened (Soviets) to remove one
element of this MAD balance: America's vulnerability. The Kremlin, from
1985 led by Mikhail Gorbachev, didn't know whether SDI would ever work
but had to assume it could. In such a scenario, Washington might feel
protected from a second (retaliatory) strike by Moscow, which could
predispose it in a conventional conflict to escalate to a preemptive
nuclear attack. As a result, Star Wars, even though it was defensive,
made the Soviets feel less safe.

The Kremlin had no good options. Economically and technologically, the
Soviet Union was so far behind the US that building its own
missile-defense system was out of the question. If SDI had come close to
realization, the Soviets would have had to contemplate their own
preemptive strike against the US before it became invulnerable --- the
ultimate disaster. As it was, Gorbachev made SDI, along with missiles
and warheads, the subject of his arms-control negotiations with Reagan.
(A different leader might have acted less sagely.)

The situation today is different. First, **[[the US
faces]{.underline}]{.mark}** not just one threat but several: **[the old
[nuclear]{.mark} "peer" in [Russia]{.mark}, the
"near-peer"]{.underline}** rising nuclear power **[of [China]{.mark},
the rogue atomic actors in [No]{.mark}]{.underline}**rth
**[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea (**[and]{.underline}** possibly
**[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}** if it builds a bomb), **[[and]{.mark}
unpredictable players such as [Pakistan]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The main
antagonists in war games are **[Russia and China. [They
could collude in]{.mark} an [attack on the US]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Unlike the old Soviet Union, China in particular can also match the US
economically and technologically and build its own dome or new and more
diabolical weapons.

It is already doing that, in fact. Like the US and Russia,
**[China]{.underline}** nowadays **[has much faster missiles that can
take more eccentric flight paths]{.underline}** and carry more
independently targeted warheads, **[[overwhelming]{.underline}]{.mark}**
almost **[[any defensive system by]{.mark} sheer [numbers]{.mark}.
Beijing also has a hypersonic]{.underline}** glide vehicle. Whereas
ballistic missiles have to re-enter the atmosphere in a predictable arc,
these vehicles can maneuver in the atmosphere, concealing their target
--- and all of it **[at many times the speed of sound]{.underline}**. If
Golden Dome mainly looks up at the skies, it might not catch these death
darts coming in low from the sides.

Moreover, many of the Golden Dome's sensors and interceptors would be
**[[in space]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As Seth Moulton, a congressman on
the House Armed Services Committee, pointed out during a hearing, the
**[[Russians are]{.underline}]{.mark}** reportedly **[[preparing]{.mark}
to place [nukes up there]{.mark}. Why wouldn't they]{.underline}**, or
the Chinese, **[[detonate those]{.underline}]{.mark}** at the start of
an attack **[[to take out]{.mark} the [American]{.mark}]{.underline}**
space **[[interceptors]{.mark} first?]{.underline}** (Responding to
Golden Dome, the Chinese this week warned that it might turn "outer
space into a battlefield.")

And why only look up if the threat could also come from below? As
Moulton observed, submarines can launch nukes too and "you can run a
boat up into Los Angeles Harbor, right? It's clear that Golden Dome is
not designed to defend against that."

In short, new American defenses, even before they become operational,
will force adversaries to recalculate their own assumptions and
strategies. The Chinese have already said that they are "gravely
concerned" about **[[Golden Dome]{.underline}]{.mark}** and worry that
it **[[will jeopardize]{.mark} "strategic balance and
[stability]{.mark}."]{.underline}** One of their **[fears]{.underline}**
is that **[the US, feeling secure]{.underline}** from retaliation,
**[could blackmail them]{.underline}** with nuclear threats **[to stand
down in a conflict]{.underline}** over Taiwan.

US-Russia Relations and Its Possible Prospects"

wtk

**[Since the Ukrainian crisis]{.underline}**, and especially since the
outbreak of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict in 2022, **[US-Russia
[relations]{.mark} [have been on a downward
spiral]{.mark}]{.underline}**, a trajectory many believed would remain
"stable" for a long time, even after the conflict's end. **[However,
[almost overnight]{.mark}]{.underline}**, without any prior warning,
**[[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[changed]{.mark} its [policy]{.mark}, initiated dialogue with Russia,
[and]{.mark} quickly [began]{.mark} efforts [to restore
relations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Simultaneously, US-EU relations
deteriorated, and Ukraine was effectively abandoned by the United
States. In the history of great powers, such a sudden and subversive
shift in a country's diplomatic trajectory, without any fundamental
changes in conditions, is extremely rare, though not unprecedented. This
development defies the general laws of international politics. The
changes in the United States have dramatically altered the international
landscape and significantly transformed the course of Russian-American
relations.

US-Russia relations have experienced numerous ups and downs over the
past three decades. In the early 1990s, under the enthusiastic efforts
of Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton, the two nations entered a
"honeymoon period," and in 1993, they declared themselves strategic
partners. However, this optimism was short-lived. Due to NATO's eastward
expansion, the Kosovo War, and disputes over Iran, Iraq, arms control,
Chechnya, and other issues, US-Russian relations deteriorated into a
"cold peace."

The inaugurations of George W. Bush Jr. and Vladimir Putin in 2000
renewed hopes for improved relations. Following the September 11
terrorist attacks in 2001, US-Russian relations warmed rapidly, reaching
a level of near "comrades-in-arms." In May 2002, George W. Bush Jr.
visited Russia and announced a new strategic partnership between the two
countries. However, this rapprochement did not last long. After the US
launched the Iraq War in 2003, US-Russian relations cooled once again.

In 2008, both the United States and Russia underwent presidential
transitions, with Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev assuming office. This
renewed optimism in US-Russia relations led the Obama administration to
propose a "reset" strategy. While relations improved slightly, the
effort was underpowered and hesitant. The "reset" proved unsustainable
even before Medvedev's presidency ended and was definitively abandoned
when Putin returned to the Kremlin in 2012. The Ukraine crisis followed,
along with a series of conflicts and sanctions against Russia, driving
US-Russian relations to a new low.

In 2017, Trump, who was widely perceived as sympathetic toward Russia,
became the US president. Many predicted that he would usher in a new era
for US-Russia relations. Contrary to these expectations, however,
domestic political constraints in the United States not only prevented
any improvement but further strained the relationship. The US began
supplying weapons to Ukraine and imposed additional sanctions on Russia.
During a heated exchange with Zelensky in the Oval Office on February
28, 2025, Trump proudly declared that while his predecessor had given
Ukraine "sheets," he had provided missiles.

What, then, are the prospects for US-Russia relations this time? Will
the two nations repeat the cycle of past failures, or will they break
free from this seemingly fatalistic pattern?

This latest shift in US-Russia relations differs from previous ones in
several important ways, the most notable being that it has alleviated
some of the persistent contradictions that have plagued the bilateral
relationship since the Cold War.

Over the past 30 years, NATO's eastward expansion has been the most
significant obstacle in US-Russia relations. Russia vehemently opposes
NATO's expansion, viewing it as a strategic security threat, while NATO
insists on continuing its enlargement. This has created an
insurmountable barrier to improving US-Russian relations. The United
States has been the primary driver of NATO's expansion, often taking a
more aggressive stance than Europe. At the 2008 NATO summit in
Bucharest, it was President George W. Bush who pushed for Ukraine and
Georgia to join the alliance, a move only thwarted by opposition from
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy.

Now, **[the [Trump]{.mark} administration has [made]{.mark} it
[clear]{.mark} that [Ukraine is unlikely to join NATO]{.mark} in the
near future, effectively ruling out the possibility]{.underline}**.
While this does not fundamentally resolve the issue, it marks a
significant shift. Russia insists on formal guarantees at the level of
international law, which it wants included in any final peace treaty.
The process of Ukraine's accession to NATO has been ongoing since the
2008 Bucharest summit, and at the February 2025 Washington Summit
commemorating NATO's 75th anniversary, it was declared that Ukraine's
path to membership was "irreversible." From Russia's perspective, these
political positions must be formally corrected.

In any case, **[the [new]{.mark} US [policy]{.mark} has [significantly
eased tensions between Russia and the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}**, **[raising hopes of removing one of the
most contentious issues in their relationship]{.underline}**. If Ukraine
were to join a European-oriented military alliance in the future, the
resulting conflict would primarily involve Russia and Europe, not Russia
and the United States. Should NATO continue to fragment and weaken, or
even disintegrate, the issue of NATO enlargement would naturally
disappear from the US-Russia agenda.

**[Security issues have always been central to US-Russia
relations]{.underline}**. **[The US has long viewed Russia as a security
threat and adversary]{.underline}**, a stance enshrined in official
strategy documents, including the National Security Strategy (2017) and
the National Defense Strategy (2018) during Trump's first term, as well
as the 2021 Interim National Security Strategic Guidance and the 2022
National Defense Strategy Report under Biden.

**[Since his return to office, however, [Trump]{.mark}'s perspective has
shifted]{.underline}**. **[He now [downplays Russia's security threat to
the U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates,
viewing Russia primarily as a threat to Europe. America's new Secretary
of Defense, Pete Hegseth, speaking at a meeting of the Ukrainian Defense
Contact Group in December 2024, stated that the US security focus would
shift from Europe to the Asia-Pacific, with Europe taking primary
responsibility for its own security. This indicates that while the Trump
administration has not yet formally redefined Russia's security threat,
**[the trend is clear]{.underline}**: **[[Russia's perceived threat to
the US has diminished]{.underline}]{.mark}**. If the Russia-Ukraine
conflict can be resolved through a peace agreement, it would further
reinforce this shift. Although both China and Russia are officially
defined as security threats by the US, China is considered a
"comprehensive and persistent threat," while Russia is seen as an "acute
threat," largely due to the ongoing war in Ukraine. Should the war end,
Russia's perceived threat level would likely decrease further.

To a certain extent, Trump has moved away from value-based diplomacy, a
traditional pillar of American liberal foreign policy and a major source
of tension in US-Russia relations. Value-based diplomacy is
fundamentally incompatible with Russia's diplomatic philosophy, leading
to ideological and policy clashes between the two nations. The US often
divides the world based on ideology, transcends international law, and
interferes in other countries' internal affairs under the guise of
promoting democracy, even orchestrating "color revolutions" to
legitimize the overthrow of governments.

It is important to note that value-based diplomacy is not purely
ideological; it is also driven by geopolitical interests. The regimes
targeted by "color revolutions" are often those disliked by the West,
while the new governments that emerge are typically pro-Western. The
West has labeled Russia an authoritarian state, opposing its values and
branding it an "outcast" in the global political moral system. This has
created an invisible barrier between the West and Russia. Trump,
however, is notoriously dismissive of ideology in favor of practical
interests. He is willing to engage with any country for mutual benefit
and will not hesitate to confront any nation, regardless of its
ideology, if interests conflict. In doing so, Trump has at least reduced
the impact of ideological factors on US-Russia relations.

**[Since Trump's return to office, [there is a possibility that Russia
and the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [could restart strategic arms
reduction negotiations]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Nuclear arms control has
long been a cornerstone of US-Russia security relations. The New START
Treaty is set to expire in February 2026. Given the ongoing
Russia-Ukraine conflict, negotiations on a new treaty have been stalled.
**[If Russia and the US can resume talks and reach a new agreement, it
would have a significant positive impact on easing tensions between the
two nations.]{.underline}**

There are practical reasons for the development of Golden Dome. **[[The

**[not the strategic arsenals of Russia or China.]{.underline}**]{.mark}
Additionally, the ground-based interceptors provide limited protection
against hypersonic weapons.

### L---BMD---2NC

#### Enhancing US BMD causes Russian nuclear modernization and [exotic weapons]{.underline}

**Brown 25**, Professor of Political Science at Temple University (James
D. J. Brown, 5-19-2025, "What Will the U.S. Golden Dome Missile Defense
Mean for Russia?"
https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2025/05/golden-dome-missile-russia?lang=en)
wtk

What does all this mean for Russia? **[[Trump presents Golden Dome as a
mechanism for]{.mark} promoting [stability]{.mark} and
peace.]{.underline}** He has long been skeptical of nuclear weapons,
describing them as "big monsters" and saying: "It would be great if we
could all denuclearize." His hope is that Golden Dome will allow the
United States to reduce its reliance on nuclear weapons. This is because
if the United States has a reliable means of ensuring the failure of an
attack on its homeland (deterrence by denial), it will need less
capability to strike at adversaries (deterrence by punishment).

Needless to say, **[[this is not how]{.mark} strategists in [Moscow view
matters]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In 2002, the United States unilaterally
withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Since then, **[Russian
officials have]{.underline}** **[consistently warned of the
destabilizing effects of missile defense]{.underline}**. In 2019,
**[Russia's foreign ministry condemned]{.underline}** the
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates' then more modest
**[missile defense plans as proof of "Washington's desire to ensure
uncontested military domination in the world]{.underline}**." **[[Their
concern is that]{.underline}]{.mark}**, secure behind its defenses,
**[[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[**[could not be deterred from aggression]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

Washington's response was always that its missile defenses were only to
counter the limited threats from North Korea and Iran, and in no way
undermined Russia's large, sophisticated arsenal. This argument---which
was never fully accepted by Moscow---has now been cast aside. In what
represents an epochal change in U.S. policy, Golden Dome is explicitly
directed not only against "rogue adversaries," but also against "peer"
and "near-peer" states (i.e. Russia and China).

Moscow's experts will remain confident that even with its current
capabilities, Russia's strategic arsenal could overcome Golden Dome
thanks to countermeasures such as decoys and jamming devices. There is
also the option of "saturation," i.e. overcoming defenses by launching
more missiles than can be intercepted.

However, high confidence is not sufficient in the world of deterrence.
**[[Since the survival of the nation is at stake, strategists must
proceed from the worst-case scenario]{.mark} [and assume that Golden
Dome would be effective]{.mark} at least [against]{.mark} a [Russian
second strike.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[[Russia will]{.mark} therefore need to
[respond]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[That will entail
[accelerating]{.mark}]{.underline}** existing **[[efforts to modernize
each leg of the nuclear triad]{.underline}]{.mark}** by replacing
Soviet-era delivery systems with newer Russian designs.

**[[We can also expect renewed emphasis on exotic
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[that promise to evade all conceivable
missile defense systems]{.underline}**. In 2018, Putin famously unveiled
what were subsequently dubbed his nuclear "super weapons." These include
the Burevestnik, a ground-launched, nuclear-powered cruise missile with
supposedly unlimited range, and Poseidon, a nuclear-powered torpedo that
is intended for strikes on aircraft carrier groups or coastal
infrastructure. **[Since Golden Dome focuses exclusively on aerial
attacks, [it is likely that Poseidon will become an even greater
priority]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

**[[A]{.mark}nother [probable response is a redoubling of Russian
interest in nuclear a]{.mark}nti-[sat]{.mark}ellite
[weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The advantage of **[such
weapons]{.underline}** is that they **[could quickly eliminate a whole
constellation of U.S. military satellites.]{.underline}** The downside
is that they would cause tremendous collateral damage, eliminating
numerous civilian satellites and causing untold disruption to life on
earth. However, if the choice were between losing a nuclear war and
destroying much of the world's space infrastructure, the Kremlin would
undoubtedly select the latter option.

Golden Dome will therefore press Russia into a new arms race, forcing it
to devote yet more resources to its strategic forces at a time when the
country can least afford it. The Russian defense budget is already
overstretched by the war in Ukraine, and rebuilding Russia's
conventional forces will take years. These vast outlays will require
further diversion of funds from civilian sectors, with predictable
consequences for the long-term health of the Russian economy.

**[[Russia's hurry to develop "super weapons"]{.mark} and nuclear
weapons for space [bring]{.mark} further
[dangers]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[Poseidon and Burevestnik have been
much hyped by the Kremlin, yet [they remain in the development stage and
the risk of accidents is high]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The
nuclear-powered **[Burevestnik]{.underline}** attracts particular
concern and **[has been labeled "a flying Chernobyl]{.underline}**." A
failed test in 2019 is reported to have caused the death of five
engineers.

### L---Sub Detection/UUVs---2NC

#### Increasing UUV's disrupts strategic stability---it makes SSBNs vulnerable

Technology Policy at George Washington University. (Sylvia Mishra,

deterrence?"

**[[Nuclear deterrence rests on the ability of strategic assets to
survive]{.mark} an enemy's [first strike]{.mark} and to retaliate,
ensuring mutually assured destruction.]{.underline}**

Nuclear-powered ballistic-missile submarines
(**[[SSBNs]{.underline}]{.mark}**) **[[are]{.underline}]{.mark}**
considered to be **[[the most survivable]{.mark} of all nuclear
platforms due to their stealth capabilities]{.underline}**, mobility and
discretion. Placing nuclear assets underwater puts them at a safer
distance from a crippling first strike. [**[But]{.underline}** **[as
tech]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[nology [improves]{.mark} and the ocean
battlefield becomes more complex]{.underline}**, **[[these advances
could undermine the survivability of strategic
forces]{.underline}]{.mark}** around the world and make them far more
vulnerable.

Emerging technologies like unmanned underwater vehicles
(**[[UUVs]{.underline}]{.mark}**) **[[add]{.mark} to the
[complexity]{.mark} of the battle space and disrupt the status
quo]{.underline}**. Swarms of **[[autonomous]{.mark} underwater [drones
could be deployed to hunt]{.mark} ballistic-missile
[submarines]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [**[targeting a cornerstone of
nuclear deterrence]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

In their 2017 article 'The new era of counterforce', Keir A. Lieber and
Daryl Press argue that for most of the nuclear age, the survivability of
retaliatory forces seemed straightforward. However, improvements in
counterforce technology have eroded this cornerstone of nuclear
deterrence. As new technology continues to raise the potential for major
shifts in the military realm, the rapid advent of these drones may
reduce the credibility and effectiveness of SSBNs.

UUVs can function without the direction of a human operator and have
wide dual-use (that is, civilian and military) applications. Some are
used for commercial purposes, hydrography and oceanographic research.
Lockheed Martin's yellow Marlin drone submarine inspects offshore rigs
and underwater pipelines, a task that's worth around a billion dollars a
year in the Gulf of Mexico.

But **[UUV technologies have been evolving from defensive to more
offensive roles]{.underline}**. **[[UUVs increasingly play a critical
role in]{.underline}]{.mark}** antisubmarine warfare
(**[[ASW]{.underline}]{.mark}**) **[and perform missions such as placing
and monitoring sensors on the sea floor to track enemy
submarines]{.underline}**. They can gather intelligence on opponents,
detect and neutralise mines, hunt submarines and chart the ocean floor.
They could, potentially, detonate warheads. And they could take part in
a coordinated attack on an enemy submarine in conjunction with
'friendly' submarines and surface vessels.

The United States, Russia and China are investing in this technology to
bolster their ASW capability and it's evident that UUVs will be deployed
in the near future in combat operations.

The US Navy released a UUV masterplan in 2004 that set out nine priority
areas for future UUV capabilities. In 2015, Brigadier General Frank
Kelly became the first deputy assistant secretary of the US Navy for
unmanned systems. In 2016, the Department of Defense reportedly spent
US\$232.9 million on procuring UUVs (US\$86.7 million more than in
2015). In 2018, the US Office of Naval Research awarded Raytheon a
US\$29.7 million contract for developing a naval prototype of a
'low-cost UAV swarming technology', or LOCUST, system that can overwhelm
an adversary.

Russia and China aren't far behind. Several reports indicate that Russia
has been working on a 'killer underwater drone' since 2015. The
'Cephalopod' is designed for the underwater battlefield. Undersea
warfare expert H.I. Sutton says that it can target shipping but its
torpedoes are intended to destroy submarines. In a March 2018 speech to
the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation, President Vladimir Putin
highlighted Russian military development of an underwater drone aimed at
transforming underwater warfare. A RAND Corporation report, Emerging
trends in China's development of unmanned systems, said Beijing had been
funding 15 different universities for research programs for UUVs.
Reports indicate that China is also developing low-cost unmanned UUVs
for a variety of military applications, including 'suicide' attacks on
enemy vessels.

These trends indicate that the **[proliferation of UUVs will have an
impact on the stability of the undersea warfighting
domain]{.underline}**. Emerging capabilities suggest that **[[the
sea-based leg of the triad]{.underline}]{.mark}** of missile submarines,
land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles and crewed bombers
**[[will increasingly become vulnerable]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

However, some experts argue that **[[underwater drone technology is
still in a nascent stage of development]{.underline}]{.mark}** and faces
challenges in autonomous operations and communication. **[The density of
seawater makes it difficult for UUVs to complete complex]{.underline}**
tasks that require real-time decision-making. Former Chief of US Naval
Operations Admiral Jonathan Greenert noted that one of the biggest
obstacles for underwater drones is that they run on batteries that last
only a few hours and communication is difficult because data passes very
slowly through water.

**[It will take time for underwater drone technology to mature and pose
a serious threat to well-hidden SSBNs]{.underline}**, **[but [when
drones swarm in packs]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [**[it will become harder
for submarines to escape detection.]{.underline}** **[Advances in UUV
tech]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[nology [will undermine the stability of
deterrence and usher in a new]{.mark} underwater [arms race that will
increase the risks of escalation in a crisis.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[The oceans have long represented a challenging environment for
sensing technologies]{.underline}**. **[Onboard passive sensors
have]{.underline}** historically **[faced technological
limitations]{.underline}** due to low signal-to-noise and inhospitable
sensing environments. Additionally, the vantage restrictions posed by
static positioning of sea-based sensors, whether active or passive, has
allowed submarines to travel vast swathes of the oceans largely
undetected. As a result, **[[sea-launched ballistic missiles have been
important to ensuring a second-strike capability]{.mark} and maintaining
the strategic balance between nuclear adversaries]{.underline}**. New,
**[mobile]{.underline}**, and **[active [sensing
technologies]{.mark}]{.underline}**, however, [**[are]{.underline}**
**[changing this status quo and leaving
sub]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[marine [forces increasingly
vulnerable]{.mark} to detection]{.underline}**. These new sensing
systems combined with smart data processing techniques for decision
support have the potential to substantially impact strategic situational
awareness.

Unmanned underwater vehicles (**[[UUVs]{.underline}]{.mark}**)
**[[are]{.underline}]{.mark}** an **[[emerging]{.underline}]{.mark}**
class of unmanned maritime vehicles (UMVs) **[[with the potential to
transform]{.underline}]{.mark}** anti-submarine warfare
(**[[ASW]{.underline}]{.mark}**) **[through new capabilities for sensing

**[employ active sonar to detect]{.underline}**, characterize, and track
**[adversary submarines]{.underline}** via an unmanned mobile platform
under the sea. The UUV system allows access to shallow or previously
difficult-to-penetrate waters and provides a dynamic platform for
observation and detection. UUV vehicles augment existing platforms used
to track adversary submarines including the airborne Poseidon 8-A,
surface-based submarine hunters, and manned submarines. **[The unmanned
characteristic of UUVs]{.underline}** and potential for autonomous use
(as well as their relatively small size) **[separate them from existing
ASW technologies]{.underline}**.1 **[UUVs are also designed to deploy

In the absence of available inhabited aircraft, however, it is possible
that an augmented OTHR and the North Warning System could help maintain
custody. Current generation UAVs possess neither the radar capabilities
nor the high speeds needed to keep pace with enemy strike aircraft. But
**[[UAVs could be deployed to provide overwatch of]{.mark} likely

### L---Unilateral Action---2NC

#### Unliteral efforts to achieve domain awareness in the Arctic will undermine strategic stability -- that increases Russian aggression in the region

**[There are]{.underline}** four **[broad Arctic strategies that
could]{.underline}** theoretically **[be pursued by the United
States]{.underline}** to achieve its objectives in the Arctic,
accounting for the strategic asymmetries in the region. **[[A direct
rebalance approach would call for U.S. efforts to unilaterally
improve]{.mark} military [capabilities]{.mark} and unilaterally work [to
curb Russia's advantage]{.mark} through a competitive
approach]{.underline}**. A coalition-based offsetting approach would
prioritize working with Arctic and near-Arctic allies to mitigate
Russia's actions. A domain-based offsetting approach would require
focusing on economic and resource aspects of competition in the Arctic
zone to maximize U.S. advantages. Finally, a stability approach centers
on enhancing transparency and pursuing areas of U.S.-Russia (and China)
cooperation where interests overlap. Participants argued that **[a
direct rebalance would heighten Russia's threat
perception]{.underline}**, require immense resources, and be
inconsistent with the United States' current economic footprint and
overall interests in the region. **[[This]{.underline}]{.mark}**
approach **[[would]{.underline}]{.mark}** likely **[[heighten]{.mark}
existing [Russian fears, lead it to pursue a more aggressive strategy,
and]{.mark} potentially [undermine strategic
stability]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Given Russia's]{.mark} geographic
[proximity]{.mark} to the region and its resources]{.underline}**,
participants also agreed that **[[establishing]{.mark} economic [parity
with Russia through a domain-based offsetting approach would be an
uphill battle]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As such, while U.S.-Russia
dynamics may increasingly be framed in competitive terms, [**[the United
States should not seek to "match" Russia in the
Arctic]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

### !---AT: Plan Solves Deterrence---2NC

#### Missiles [are cheaper]{.underline} than interceptors\-\--enemies will [find ways around]{.underline} defense. 

**Holmes 19**, Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation (Deverrick
Holmes, June 25, 2019, "Congress is not asking the right questions about
missile defense," Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists,
https://thebulletin.org/2019/06/congress-is-not-asking-the-right-questions-about-missile-defense/)

**[[Following a]{.mark} recent [successful]{.mark} "salvo" interception
[test]{.mark}]{.underline}**, Senator Dan
**[[Sullivan]{.underline}]{.mark}** of Alaska (where the bulk of the GMD
program is located) **[[boasted]{.mark}, "...this test [gives our
enemies pause]{.mark}, making them [doubt]{.mark} the effectiveness of
[their offensive capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}**." Sullivan is
correct that these tests make enemies question the effectiveness of
their deterrent, but **[[that's the problem]{.mark}. US [adversaries
view]{.mark} their [offensive capabilities]{.mark} as [fundamental
to]{.mark} their [security]{.mark}, and they [will take any]{.mark} and
all [steps to maintain]{.mark} those]{.underline}** capabilities. US
**[attempts to undermine the deterrent]{.underline}** forces of other
countries **[create a dangerous cycle]{.underline}** in which each side
is compelled to find new and increasingly destabilizing ways to maintain
the upper hand. **[Increases in defense only drive US adversaries to
find ways to counter]{.underline}** those defenses.

For example, both Russia and China are developing hypersonic missiles,
specifically hypersonic boost- glide vehicles. Unlike traditional
intercontinental ballistic missiles, these new systems fly along an
unpredictable path, and the GMD system is not capable of dealing with
such a threat. Russia has also unveiled evasive and creative
new delivery systems, including a nuclear torpedo and a nuclear cruise
missile. These new Russian offensive missiles are in direct response to
US insistence on strategic missile defense---and exist solely for the
purpose of defeating it.

**[Adding to the challenges, missile [interceptors are]{.mark} far [more
expensive than]{.mark} offensive [missiles]{.mark}. That [makes it
cost-effective for]{.mark} US [adversaries]{.mark} to [just build more
and more]{.mark} missiles [to overwhelm]{.mark} US
[defenses]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In turn, this prompts the United
States to respond by making more and more interceptors, virtually
ensuring a new arms race. That sort of instability is exactly what the
United States should try to avoid. In fact, the Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty was enacted to deal with this exact scenario. Unfortunately, the
United States pulled out of the treaty in 2002, due in part to advice
from current National Security Advisor John Bolton, who worked as Under
Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security at the
time.

### !---Poseidon---2NC 

#### The strategic benefits ensure use, whether accidentally or intentionally.

**Episkopos 19**, Writer for the National Interest, Ph.D., History,
American University (Mark Episkopos, November 7, 2019, "Russia Is
Preparing To Deploy Its Nuclear Doomsday Drones On Submarines," The
National Interest,
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/russia-preparing-deploy-its-nuclear-doomsday-drones-submarines-94151)

However, **[[there are]{.mark} strategic [benefits to]{.mark} a weapon
like [Poseidon]{.mark} that may [not]{.mark} be [readily
apparent]{.mark}]{.underline}**. First and foremost, Poseidon
**[[enhances]{.mark} Russia's [nuclear threat by diversifying]{.mark}
its [first-strike]{.mark} capability]{.underline}**. That is, the
Russian military believes that **[[it travels too fast and]{.mark} too
[deep]{.mark} underwater [to be intercepted]{.mark}]{.underline}** by
torpedoes or otherwise countered. To the Kremlin, **[Poseidon is [yet
another way to circumvent
America's]{.mark} formidable [strategic]{.mark} missile
[defense]{.mark}]{.underline}** network.

But **[[even if countermeasures can]{.mark} reliably [prevent
Poseidon]{.mark}]{.underline}** from destroying coastal cities, **[it
[still possesses]{.mark} a large [destabilizing
potential]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For example: detonating Poseidon off
America's coast will at the **[very least [inflict]{.mark} mass
political [panic]{.mark} and military confusion]{.underline}**, which
can be used as cover for a different offensive operation.

Secondly, Russian media have floated the possibility of **[Poseidon
being deployed against aircraft carriers and other surface
vessels]{.underline}**; to this end, it can be armed with a conventional
payload. Depending on Poseidon's production costs and
price-to-performance numbers, this can prove to be a more cost-effective
way to neutralize carriers than swarms of conventional air and
surface-launched missiles. Finally, the unconventional threat posed by
Poseidon may be a source of Russian leverage in ongoing arms reduction
talks with the US.

Still, Poseidon is by no means a decisive advancement of Russian nuclear
capabilities. What it does offer\-- provided that it lives up to its
technical potential\-- are **[[strategic benefits]{.underline}]{.mark}**
that **[can [complement Russia's nuclear]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
conventional **[[flexibility]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### Poseidon causes [extinction]{.underline}. 

**Lockie 19**, Editor, Business Insider, citing Stephen Swartz, Fellow
for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (Alex Lockie, February 11,

doomsday device," Business Insider India,
https://www.businessinsider.in/the-real-purpose-of-russias-100-megaton-underwater-nuclear-doomsday-device/)

**[[Russia has]{.underline}]{.mark}** built **[[a]{.mark} new
[100-megaton]{.mark} underwater [nuclear doomsday device]{.mark}
and]{.underline}** repeatedly **[threatened the US with
it]{.underline}**.

**[The device]{.underline}** goes beyond traditional ideas of nuclear
warfighting and **[[poses a]{.mark} direct [threat to]{.mark} the
[future of human]{.mark} or [life]{.mark} on Earth]{.underline}**.

Nobody has ever built a weapon like this before because there\'s almost
no military utility to so badly destroying the world.

But an expert on nuclear strategy told Business Insider the weapon may
have a larger role in helping Russian President Vladimir Putin break
down NATO with the threat of nuclear destruction.

Ever since 2015 when images of a Russian nuclear torpedo first leaked on
state television, the world has asked itself **[why Moscow would build a
weapon that [could]{.mark} potentially [end all life]{.mark} on
Earth]{.underline}**.

While all nuclear weapons can kill thousands in the blink of an eye and
**[leave [radiation poisoning]{.mark} the environment for years to
come]{.underline}**, Russia\'s new doomsday device, called **[the
\"[Poseidon]{.mark},\" [takes steps to maximize this]{.mark}
effect]{.underline}**.

If the US fired one of its Minutemen III nuclear weapons at a target, it
would detonate in the air above the target and rely on the blast\'s
incredible downward pressure to crush it. The fireball from the nuke may
not even touch the ground, and the only radiation would come from the
bomb itself and any dust particles in air swept up in the
explosion, Stephen Schwartz, author of \"Atomic Audit\" previously told
Business Insider.

But **[Russia\'s [Poseidon]{.mark} reportedly [uses a warhead hundreds
of times stronger]{.mark}, and perhaps even as strong as the largest
bomb ever detonated]{.underline}**. Additionally, **[[it will come
into]{.mark} direct [contact with water]{.mark}]{.underline}**, marine
animals, and the ocean floor, **[[kicking up]{.mark} a [radioactive
tsunami that]{.mark} could [spread]{.mark} deadly [radiation
over]{.mark} hundreds of [thousands of miles]{.mark}]{.underline}** of
land and sea, **[[rendering it uninhabitable]{.underline}]{.mark}** for
decades.

Doomed to fail. **[[Trump]{.mark}'s]{.underline}** executive

surprise most experts on existential risks. The climate crisis, the

Trump claims that "over the past 40 years, rather than lessening, the

missiles]{.mark}]{.underline}**, carrying 2,236 warheads. China's
land-based nuclear-armed missiles capable of reaching the United States
have increased from around 20 in 1985 to some 135 today (carrying 238
warheads) and perhaps 72 single-warhead submarine-based missiles. **[In

roughly [**[one-fifth]{.underline}** **[the number of enemy missiles

nuclear warheads (728 vs. 2,365 missiles and 2,546 vs. 9,320 warheads).
That is still a very dangerous threat but by no means a greater one.

**[[Military leaders have sought]{.underline}]{.mark}** hard
**[[data]{.underline}]{.mark}** to drive their decisions **[for
decades]{.underline}**, perhaps most famously beginning with Secretary
of Defense Robert McNamara's so-called Whiz Kids in the 1960s. As
retrospective analysis of McNamara's data-driven approach to strategy
made clear, however, data alone does not good decisions make. Errors in
collection, transmission, and presentation decimated the efficacy of
this initiative. The Vietnam War is a cautionary tale in data-driven
decision-making gone wrong, an important reminder that modernity's
insatiable need for ever **[more data may be no]{.underline}** more a

**[[Reasons for data's failure to enable perfected decision-making are

complex, brittle systems of systems, **[[demolishes agility]{.mark} and

mandates of mission command]{.underline}**. Here, too, we must not only
ask whether or not we can enable certain functions with data, but also
whether or not we should. Important questions regarding the efficacy of
data-driven decision-making must also be addressed, especially in a
world where data overload is not a danger but rather a given. Finally,
well-studied **[[biases threaten to make efforts]{.mark} to achieve
[data-driven decision-making little more than a quest for
decision-driven data]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Here, however, I deal only
with the substantial **[[technical challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}**
facing the joint force in making data-driven decisions. These challenges
**[fall [in]{.mark}to three categories:]{.underline}** **[[collection,

But the GMD system also has its critics---in fact, **[the Union of
Concerned Scientists doesn't think the system actually
works]{.underline}**: "though the idea of a missile shield may sound
attractive, **[today's]{.underline}** homeland **[system is hugely
expensive, ineffective, and offers no proven capability to protect the
United States---and no credible path forward for achieving
success]{.underline}**." The organization's main concern is that the
**[[GMD system can't handle countermeasure]{.mark}s deployed by an
enemy]{.underline}**. **[[An ICBM could launch decoys]{.mark} during the
midcourse phase to distract the interceptor: [those]{.mark} lightweight
decoys [would follow the same trajectory]{.mark} as the real ICBM in
space, [making it hard for the interceptor to determine which is the
real warhead]{.mark}. This could force the GMD system to use up its
interceptors---there are currently only 44---before the real threats are
launched.]{.underline}** Additionally, **[the ICBM could be equipped
with a "cooled shroud," which lowers the temperature of the warhead.
Since interceptors rely on infrared sensors to track their targets, it
would take them longer to home in on the ICBM---that is, if they see it
at all. Both of these [countermeasures are within reach of]{.mark}
countries like [Russia, Iran and]{.mark} North
[Korea]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which are building ICBMs. But the
Pentagon has still invested over \$40 billion in missile defense. Also,
while the military points to the two-shot salvo test as proof that the
GMD system works, others are more skeptical about the test results.
"**[The simulated attacking missile's trajectory, its exact coordinates,
had to be programmed into the intercepting missile's guidance
system---an entirely unrealistic way to track an evasive drop of rain in
a ballistic hurricane]{.underline}**," said Doug Vaughan, a defense
reporter who has covered missile defense since SDI. "And for all that,
**[[they]{.mark} still [failed more often than
not]{.mark}]{.underline}**." **[The test was performed on a
"threat-representative ICBM"---not a real one. The U.S. military isn't
about to launch a ballistic missile at itself to test the system, so
there's no way to really tell if the system will perform successfully
until someone launches an ICBM at the U.S. homeland. While [missile
defense]{.mark} technology may have progressed]{.underline}** since the
Reagan era, **[its [effectiveness is]{.mark} still [in
doubt]{.mark}]{.underline}**---**[especially when conventional
deterrence is doing a much more effective job at keeping the U.S.

**[may just be [pushing]{.mark} U.S. [adversaries to]{.mark} develop
technologies to [counter it]{.mark}]{.underline}**---potentially
**[[making the system obsolete before it even gets

new strategic weapons to counter the interceptor. One example is
hypersonic weapons technology]{.underline}**---missiles that could move
too fast for U.S. missile defense systems to intercept. But the lack of
evidence of the system's effectiveness doesn't seem to be slowing down
the Department of Defense. The existing arsenal of 44 GMD interceptors
could soon be increased, as the Pentagon has requested funding for 20
more. "**[What the Pentagon is now hyping is a plan to throw 'salvos' of
more, better, faster, smarter rocks at enemy rockets and, at best, knock
down maybe 10 percent of the incoming missiles]{.underline}**," said
Vaughan. "**[The other 90 percent---or even 1 percent---that get through
will kill millions."]{.underline}**

### Tech Fails---1NC

#### The US has major capacity constraints that limit Arctic domain awareness -- limited miliary presence and a lack of icebreakers 

Abbie **Tingstad et al**., 11/1/**23**, RAND, "Report on the Arctic
Capabilities of the U.S. Armed Forces,"
https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA1638-1.html, mm

Although the United States has substantial strategic capabilities for
operating from or through the Arctic, its capacity and capability for
conducting operations to secure its Arctic interests are more limited
than those of other Arctic countries. This is even more of an issue for
instances of the USCG operating alone in the region, rather than with
joint and interagency partners. Per the FY 2021 NDAA request, we have
noted in this report why the USCG operating alone is not advantageous
from the perspectives of domain awareness and self-defense or protection
from threats. Our findings suggest that the benefits of operating
jointly and with like-minded partners in the Arctic are not specific to
these two areas. In general, **[[other Arctic countries have scaled
their]{.underline}]{.mark}** capabilities and **[[capacity]{.mark} to
their respective Arctic needs]{.underline}**, considering natural
hazards, military threats, and the sizes of their populations and
economies. Even Russia's investments, including its now famously large
number of icebreakers and well-publicized efforts to refurbish Cold
War--era infrastructure, are at least roughly aligned with its massive
Arctic territory, including just over 50 percent of the circumpolar
coastline, and its equally sizable economic ambitions for the region.
**[White House]{.underline}**, DoD, DHS, and service component Arctic
**[strategies have sought to rectify this gap, but [sufficient resources
have not yet been allocated]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Similarly, China's
polar investments mirror its scientific and economic ambitions. It is
not alone among countries without polar territory in owning icebreakers.
The fact that China has multiple ice-capable vessels and is planning for
more does not directly threaten the United States. Still, we assessed
that those concerns about China utilizing Arctic activities for
opportunistic dual-purpose activities and for strategic messaging are
potentially valid. Yet domain awareness and communications are
admittedly difficult for everyone operating in the region. However,
other regional stakeholders' focus on the Arctic does give them some
advantages. In some cases, geography is also advantageous. For example,
the Nordic countries are small, and even their non-Arctic portions are
nonetheless very close and quite similar climatically to the Arctic, so
many of their capabilities are suitable for the region. One other
exception would be some aspects of Russia's military buildup in the
Arctic, a limited number of which could be interpreted as posturing
aggressively, not purely defensively. **[[The issue]{.mark} that [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates faces [has been most visible with respect
to icebreaking]{.mark}]{.underline}**; like others, **[we have noted the
severe capacity problem arising from the United States maintaining only
two operational polar icebreakers]{.underline}**. Continuing to sustain
funding for the PSC program and potentially obtaining funding for an ASC
program will be essential for right-sizing the icebreaking fleet
relative to needs, which exist at both poles and are likely to continue
increasing in the future Arctic as science missions continue and demand
increases for participation in exercises, SAR, and law enforcement.
**[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [will need
more]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[than these
icebreakers]{.underline}**]{.mark} and strategically focused assets,
such as submarines, fighter aircraft, and bomber aircraft, **[to
maintain a credible Arctic presence]{.underline}** across its sizable
Arctic territory. The existing inventory is necessary for demonstrating
presence, but it is not sufficient for practicing ongoing presence and
readiness for a wide array of plausible contingencies in the Far North
and asserting strategic influence. **[Principal among the capabilities
that should not be lost in the discussion of [icebreakers are domain
awareness]{.mark}]{.underline}**, communications, and logistics for
sustainment. **[We have highlighted]{.underline}** three types of
**[[domain-awareness challenges the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [will
face if increasing its Arctic presence]{.mark}]{.underline}**: • First,
**[[the existing system]{.mark} in place for strategic warning and
response [has not yet been fully evaluated]{.mark} and adapted for
threats designed to elude legacy sensing architectures or target
modernized critical infrastructure]{.underline}**. • Second, this
existing system was not designed with law enforcement and other Arctic
regional needs in mind. • Third, **[[the emergence of the region as one
of strategic competition could leave]{.mark} the USCG and other tactical
regional [operators with]{.mark} [limited means of identifying potential
threats to their platforms]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As noted elsewhere,
in the appendix that is not available to the public, we examine
all-domain awareness, as well as other capabilities and various threats,
in greater depth. Similarly, **[much of the Arctic communication
available to the United States was not designed for sustained
presence]{.underline}** and mobility in the context of operations in
(rather than from or through) the Arctic. **[The
[limitations]{.mark}]{.underline}** we have described come in different
varieties. These **[[include physical limitations on extending
communications]{.underline}]{.mark}** available **[[farther
south]{.underline}]{.mark}** to work in the Arctic; **[[competition
among armed forces for access to strategic
communications]{.mark};]{.underline}** **[[limited depth in]{.mark} the
[sequence of]{.mark} primary, alternative, contingency, and emergency
[communications]{.mark}; [few tangible options for supporting
higher-bandwidth applications]{.mark}; and dilemmas with respect to
policy about communicating among partners]{.underline}** (both between
U.S. internal organizations and with external countries). Another common
theme from our TTXs and interviews that we have emphasized is the issue
of sustaining presence once initiated**[. [The only U.S. Arctic presence
sustained year-round is]{.mark} at [Thule]{.mark} Air Base in
northwestern Greenland. [Creating]{.mark} and sustaining [more
presence]{.mark} in and around far northern Alaska and maintaining a
capability to deploy a sustained presence elsewhere]{.underline}**
(e.g., to the Greenland--Iceland--United Kingdom \[GIUK\] gap between
the European Arctic and North Atlantic) **[[will require substantial
investment in infrastructure]{.mark}, inventories, personnel, and
plans]{.underline}**. This would include better leveraging the Army's
ground presence in Alaska, planning between the USCG and the USN for
maritime infrastructure and capabilities, coordinating between the USCG
and the USAF to enable more-regular tactical air presence, planning for
prepositioned stock and south-to-north movement of supplies (including
determining routes), and collaborating with Alaska state, Indigenous,
commercial, and other partners. It is also true that other Arctic
countries do not have the global reach and responsibilities the United
States does. The Arctic, as a historically peaceful and
difficult-to-access region, has typically not been a high priority for
U.S. armed forces, homeland security, SAR, environmental response, and
law-enforcement investments, except during the height of the Cold War,
when the region played a key strategic role in the overarching U.S.
deterrence and homeland defense strategies. However, this is already
beginning to change: As White House, DoD, DHS, and service component
Arctic strategies have noted, the Arctic is again becoming a zone of
major power competition.

Analysis

Based on the empirical description, how can the slide from malign to
benign operations be explained? Or more precisely, why [have **[U.S. and
Russian forces since]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[[2022]{.underline}]{.mark}** seemingly **[[stopped antagonizing each
other]{.underline}]{.mark}** outside the coast of Norway? Using
Schelling's theory of brinkmanship and Lebow's warning of inadvertent
wars, **[the empirical expectation suggests that [in the post-Ukrainian
environment, U.S. and Russian forces are incentivized to move away from
the Arctic brink of war;]{.mark} [restraints on military
activities]{.mark}]{.underline}** and respect for each other's sphere of
interest **[[is safer]{.mark} than "manipulating the risk of
war"]{.underline}**. Analyzing this assumption, two explanations seem
particularly plausible: broader security concerns and strategic
necessity.

On broader security concerns, it can be argued that the Arctic
brinkmanship strategy has become too dangerous. Since the 2022 invasion,
hundreds of thousands of troops across the Euro-Atlantic region have
been mobilized and stand on a higher readiness status. U.S. and Russian
nuclear forces have thus increased their patrolling and attained a key
role in strategic deterrence.78 As the two nuclear powers are forced to
operate under more unpredictable circumstances, the current situation
seems to be characterized by a shorter strategic warning time. A
security environment where transparency, trust and confidence gradually
wither may lead to inadvertent spirals of escalation and war. As
assertive brinkmanship induces tension, and thus lower prospects for
nuclear escalation, the alternative of regaining control over the
situation is probably much safer for both protagonists. The alternative,
where crisis unfolds in ways that neither Russian nor U.S. defense
officials can fully control, is simply too risky after Russia's attempt
to invade Ukraine.

The **[post-Ukrainian restraints]{.underline}** thereby **[signify an
important aspect of Arctic security, namely that U.S. and Russian forces
are intimately tied together by one mutual interest; neither side wants
to see the Arctic become a staging ground for a risky
brink]{.underline}**man**[ship]{.underline}** **[strategy]{.underline}**

Seas]{.mark},]{.underline}** state **[[leaders]{.mark} i]{.underline}**n
Washington D.C. and Moscow **[[are allowed to take active steps away
from the brink of war]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A plausible
interpretation, therefore, is that Ukraine is not worth an increased
risk for an existential nuclear war, neither as seen from a U.S. or a
Russian perspective. As wars always unfold in unexpected ways and
consequently are hard to predict, **[managing the fear of inadvertent
escalation is safer than continuing to "manipulate the risk" in the
Arctic]{.underline}**.

mutually exclusive zones of operations, [Russian NOTAMs are absent in
the Norwegian Sea while U.S. maritime task groups are absent in the
Barents Sea]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Abstaining from provocative
exercises also means that [the two adversaries pursue a stricter rule of
engagement]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Careful not to invoke an Arctic
escalatory "tit-for-tat" logic,]{.mark} [this]{.mark}]{.underline}**
"gentleman's **[[agreement]{.mark}" can be interpreted as]{.underline}**
a sort of **[tacit cooperation. It [allows state leaders and military
commanders to buy time in case of unintended
accidents]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[In the post-Ukrainian
environment,]{.underline}** technical or human errors close to Russia's
second-strike capabilities on the Kola Peninsula should be avoided. The
**[[operative restraints]{.underline}]{.mark}** thereby **[[provide the
two opponents with more room for maneuver. If
tension]{.mark}]{.underline}** inadvertently
**[[spirals]{.underline}]{.mark}** out of control, **[[U.S. and Russian
defense officials are allowed to calm down]{.mark}, [communicate, and
clarify misperceptions]{.mark}]{.underline}** or misunderstandings.
Paradoxically, therefore, Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine has
contributed to a sense of Arctic predictability; a sense of crisis
stability where both rivals are tied to a common interest of war
avoidance.

//DH

**Andreas Østhagen = senior researcher at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute
who studies Arctic geopolitics**

Myth 1: The possibility of war in the Arctic

Østhagen, addressing the misconception of imminent war in the Arctic,
explains that the **[[conditions in the Arctic
are]{.underline}]{.mark}** often more **[[stable and
transparent]{.underline}]{.mark}** than many assume.

**[[Conflict is not easily triggered, considering the vast
areas]{.underline}]{.mark}** and diverse countries involved. Østhagen
emphasises the enormity of the Arctic, which encompasses eight
countries, four million people, and extensive ocean areas. The countries
include Russia, the Nordic states, the USA, and Canada.

He notes that the significant Russian presence -- with almost half of
the Arctic landmass under Russian control -- influences perceptions of
geopolitics in the North.

Iver B. Neumann, a Russia researcher and director at the FNI, concurs
that **[the Arctic is less likely to witness armed conflict than other
global locations.]{.underline}**

He believes the primary driver for military conflict in the Arctic is
Russia\'s use of Murmansk as a base for nuclear weapons.

"There are three main ways to keep such weapons mobile: in aircraft, on
land by rail, and at sea on submarines. Where such submarines exist, as
in Murmansk, there is also significant military attention. And where
there is military attention, there is also the potential for conflict,"
he says.

Neumann advises caution in responding to Russia\'s desire for global
attention and military control, stressing the importance of Norway
maintaining a cool head, enforcing sovereignty, and not succumbing to
intimidation.

Myth 2: Unresolved borders and a race for resources

**[As the Arctic becomes more accessible]{.underline}** due to melting
sea ice because of climate change[, **[a common myth]{.underline}**
**[suggests a scramble for resources]{.underline}**]{.mark} and land in
the North will occur.

**[[But]{.underline}]{.mark}** Østhagen clarifies that, unlike in other
parts of the world, **[[there are]{.underline}]{.mark}** almost [**[no
disputes]{.underline}** **[over Arctic borders]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

"**[All the borders are settled]{.underline}**," he says, noting that
the last conflict between Canada and Greenland was resolved in 2022.

**[Maritime boundaries are key for resource management and potential
conflict]{.underline}**. Law of the sea grants coastal states sovereign
rights for resource exploitation in their economic zones.

In the Arctic, only one maritime boundary remains unresolve. It is
between the USA and Canada -- two close allies.

[**[Østhagen]{.underline}**,]{.mark} who wrote his PhD on maritime
disputes, **[[foresees no]{.mark} major [concerns regarding sovereignty
or territorial issues]{.mark}.]{.underline}** He believes the myth
persists due to historical reasons but emphasises that, with all the
land borders settled and just one disputed sea border, Arctic resources
are already distributed among the eight Arctic states.

#### Prefer our evidence -- theirs is based upon Arctic [mythmaking]{.underline} about resources, shipping routes and Russian bases -- the reality is that there are clearly defined borders, no resource [disputes]{.underline} and [economics]{.underline} makes shipping and resource races nonviable

Realities" War on the Rocks, 5/3,

//DH

Global dynamics, from climate change to the decline of American hegemony
and technological revolution, are reshaping the Arctic. Unfortunately,
**[[mythmaking about the Arctic continues to
distort]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[narratives]{.underline}]{.mark}**
available to both public and elite audiences. Heather Exner-Pirot
beautifully explains how easy this can be and, as Josh Tallis has
written, the phantom of Arctic misgovernance can be used to raise alarm
about an unusual gap in Arctic security governance. In reality, though,
the Arctic is profoundly normal.

The following is an effort to disassemble the leading myths about the
Arctic Ocean and to underscore nuggets of truth underlying the legends.
The natural tendency, noted above, for people to process their
understanding of the Arctic through the most dramatic filter possible,
is not easy to counteract by listing mundane realities. But **[[falling
for the hype is not a good way to make policy]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Refuting these myths can put the focus back on more mundane, but
ultimately more valuable, solutions.

The Legendary Arctic Scramble

Most of the modern Arctic myths and legends are spicing up mundane
realities with added drama. For example, **[it's common to see the
Arctic referred to as a battleground for]{.underline}** valuable natural
**[resource]{.underline}**s. It's the "\$1 Trillion Ocean", holding
massive reserves of oil and gas (or one trillion dollars' worth of
critical minerals, take your pick), with echoes of Dr. Evil. Competition
over resources is framed as a "race" or "battle," although it is often
unclear what winning might mean. Industry and science have long known
that the Arctic holds a significant endowment of natural resources.
Prospecting and **[[development in the Arctic lag behind]{.mark} that of
other regions [due to the significant logistical challenges
and]{.mark}]{.underline}** resulting **[[extra
costs]{.underline}]{.mark}** relating to arctic operations. Resource
deposits in the Arctic must be of a higher grade or size to attract
investors and overcome the added risk to capital. In short, **[[it
has]{.mark} historically [been cheaper to look
elsewhere]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And that largely remains true:
**[[There has not been a flood of]{.mark} investment and [new
development]{.mark}]{.underline}** into the Arctic.

**[Rather than unclaimed, ungoverned space, [the Arctic Ocean and
surrounding landmass are almost entirely sovereign lands and waters of
the eight Arctic states.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Yes, there is a small
area of high seas, the central Arctic Ocean. This area is under a
fishing moratorium and can only be accessed through traversing an Arctic
state's waters (plus likely stopping in an Arctic state port). And yet
the myth of an Arctic wild west persists: "As a consequence of the
rapidly disappearing polar ice caps, there has been an increase in
unclaimed ocean and land territory, beyond any nation's control, that
countries are attempting to claim jurisdiction over," proclaims one
analysis. While this is a common argument, it is factually incorrect. It
is linking two separate issues into one misleading causal chain: the
decline in Arctic sea ice due to climate change, and the ongoing process
of defining boundaries and spaces under international law. In fact,
there is no unclaimed land territory in the Arctic. And there is just
one maritime boundary disagreement, between the United States and
Canada, over a tiny slice of the Beaufort Sea.

Perhaps the "Great Arctic Race" is about the overlapping claims to the
central Arctic Ocean seabed. The U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea
(UNCLOS) permits coastal states to claim areas of the extended
continental shelf beyond the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone,
if they can prove that these areas are a natural prolongation of their
continental shelf. Russia, Denmark (via Greenland), and Canada have
overlapping claims in the central Arctic. Thus far, they have all
adhered to the process of defining these claims in accordance with
international law. Russia's law-abiding approach to the Arctic shelf
claims is a rare bright spot in the country's foreign policy.

The U.N. convention and seabed claims have been in the spotlight
recently as interest grows in seabed mining for critical minerals.
**[Seabed mining is not likely to drive conflict over Arctic shelf
claims]{.underline}**. The central Arctic Ocean --- over 200 nautical
miles from any coast --- is also an incredibly inhospitable area for
resource extraction. The Arctic Ocean still freezes in the winter, and
is sunk in the frigid darkness of the polar night. **[The seabed mining
industry, like most global industry, is likely to look for less costly
options in warmer latitudes.]{.underline}** While it cannot be assumed
that Russia will continue pursuing its shelf claims in accordance with
international law, it is likely to use lower-cost tools like lawfare or
information warfare to complicate central Arctic Ocean claims, rather
than apply high-cost and hard-to-sustain military options.

The Myth of Increasing Accessibility and Arctic Shipping

The idea that climate change is increasing accessibility in the Arctic
is repeated so often that it is taken for granted. There is an element
of truth here --- the thick cap of multiyear Arctic sea ice that has
shaped the region for thousands of years is melting away and will soon
be gone. But that is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, and the net
effect of climate change in the Arctic is making human activity harder,
not easier.

Shrinking sea ice leaves coastlines unprotected from stronger, more
frequent storms. Coastal erosion is higher in the Arctic than anywhere
else, threatening U.S. radar installations. Thawing permafrost causes
subsidence, destroying infrastructure and saddling Arctic states with
massive costs --- highest in Russia. Permafrost thaw will cause many
more disasters in coming years, in Russia and elsewhere. Massive
wildfires further endanger communities and infrastructure in the North.
At sea, increased storminess and stronger waves create hazards, along
with increases in drifting ice. At the heart of it all lies uncertainty
--- a powerful dissuading factor.

Arctic shipping lanes replacing Suez and Panama is another related myth.
When crisis erupts in the Red Sea, the Suez Canal, or the Panama Canal,
it is tempting to point north to emerging Arctic shipping lanes as
alternatives. On paper, Arctic shipping routes appear to offer
considerable savings of distance, time, and fuel between northern ports
in Asia, Europe, and North America. However, in practice, these shipping
routes remain largely notional. Over the last decade, destinational
Arctic maritime activity has ticked up, mostly driven by Russia's Yamal
liquified natural gas project and expansion at Canada's Mary River Mine.
Container ships and roll-on roll-offs are barely present, and this type
of traffic has showed no change in the past decade.

It is clear that **[[Canada has no interest in opening the Northwest
Passage to]{.underline}]{.mark}** international
**[[shipping]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Furthermore, the complex routes of
the passage have draft limitations, significant remaining ice, and
inadequate charting. **[[While]{.underline}]{.mark}** Russian President
Vladimir **[[Putin has been]{.underline}]{.mark}** personally
**[[driving the]{.mark} effort to develop the [Northern Sea
Route]{.mark}]{.underline}**, imposing an ambitious timeline for cargo
growth, **[[reality is not keeping pace]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[The
route is plagued by its own draft limitations and lack of]{.mark}
supporting [infrastructure, as well as unpredictable ice
hazards]{.mark}]{.underline}**. International shipping vanished
following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, and while cargo totals have
rebounded and grown in the past two years, the Northern Sea Route is
functionally a route for Russian-flagged ships of all sorts to carry oil
and gas to Asian markets (and bring in construction materials for future
developments, which have been weakened by sanctions).

The Myth of Russian Dominance and American Indifference

**[[A large body of mythmaking]{.mark} threatens to create a security
crisis in the Arctic by [sketch]{.mark}ing [a 10-foot-tall Russia intent
on conquering]{.mark} the region]{.underline}** and controlling the
ocean and casting the United States as an impotent weakling. These
outsize legends are used to justify massive spending increases in the
Arctic, as well as significantly stronger measures against Russia, both
of which could contribute to escalation in the region and also ripple
across the global balance.

Russia's so-called "dominance" of the Arctic has been treated as gospel.
It is true that over half of the Arctic coastline is Russian territory,
and nearly half of the people living in the Arctic live in Russia. And
yet the discourse of Russian dominance in the Arctic goes beyond
geography. It also presents Russia's position as a threat to the United
States and to the entire Arctic Ocean. Of course, Moscow does everything
it can to nourish this sense of threat. Planting a flag at the seabed of
the North Pole --- possibly the most effective Russian public relations
stunt ever --- was a purely symbolic act, but continues to serve as a
reference point. Dropping paratroopers at the North Pole, or unfurling a
giant banner on the ice, are also gestures that feed the legend.

Arguments about Russia's so-called dominance of the Arctic reveal more
about America's own insecurities than the facts on the ground. This
framing creates a sense of unnecessary urgency and relies on a set of
measures that together would badly warp U.S. strategic planning. Part of
this is the legendary icebreaker gap, thoroughly debunked by Paul Avey.
Does Russia dominate the Arctic with its icebreakers? Or does it just
have a reasonable number of icebreakers for its 24,000 kilometer Arctic
coastline, along which Putin is desperately thirsting to build an
international shipping lane that has so far failed to catch on? Sober
analyses of Russia's power and strategy in the Arctic need to be
facts-based, rather than dealing in terms of dominance.

Yes, **[[Russian military capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
capacities **[in the Arctic are substantive.]{.underline}** It is widely
recognized that Russian leadership began to rebuild and expand Arctic
military capabilities and capacities as soon as it was able to, starting
in the early 2000s. **[Most authoritative analyses note that these
installations and systems [are primarily
defensive]{.mark}]{.underline}** in nature, intended **[[to help]{.mark}
control and [protect Russia's economic and strategic
interests]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the Arctic, although they could of
course be useful in supporting aggression and, as Katarzyna Zysk notes,
Russian strategic thinking does not clearly differentiate between
offence and defense. **[[All great powers have military bases along
their coastlines]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and Russia has both strategic
and economic interests to protect in its Arctic territory.

And if fears over Russia are not enough, another myth holds that China
is coming for the Arctic. Or that Chinese-Russian cooperation will open
the door for Chinese dominance in the Arctic. As Marc Lanteigne has
explained, relations between Beijing and Moscow in the Arctic are far
more complicated. And others have noted that the myth of China's growing
influence in the Arctic is mostly serving Beijing's interests. It is
important to watch the broader trajectory of Russian-Chinese relations
and not rush to assumptions about China's future in the Arctic.

In parts as a result of fears over Russian dominance, claims that the
U.S. Department of Defense "needs to do more in the Arctic" have also
become commonplace. The United States has identified several critical
gaps in operational capabilities and capacities in the Arctic, including
in the National Strategy for the Arctic Region as well as the Department
of Defense's Arctic strategy. The most significant gap is the North
Warning System, and the ongoing effort to replace this critical system.
Canada has also underscored its commitment to upgrade the key
continental defense architecture, most recently in an Arctic-focused
defense policy update. But it's also important to note that the United
States has significant Arctic military capabilities, including the
highest concentration of fifth-generation aircraft in the world, as well
as an airborne division in Alaska, along with a North American Aerospace
Defense Command (NORAD) region. U.S. Navy submarines operate and train
regularly in the Arctic Ocean.

In the current budget context, in which the Department of Defense faces
flat and tight budgets, there are not free-floating resources to build
up any but the most vital capabilities in the Arctic. Broad calls for
significant spending increases in the Arctic are divorced from the
reality of spending needs in the Indo-Pacific and Europe, and from U.S.
national strategic priorities.

The main finding is that
**[[brink]{.underline}]{.mark}**man**[[ship]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[ceased because Russia's invasion in Eastern-Europe made it too
dangerous for the two rivals to continue a "tit-for-tat" logic]{.mark}
outside Norway.]{.underline}** As Europe's largest war since 1945
unfolded, the United States and Russia could no longer push each other
towards the brink of war. **[In the post-Ukrainian security environment,
[both nuclear powers accept that inadvertent crises must be
mitigated]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[Fearing the Ukraine war will
escalate beyond its borders, both parties have tempered their Arctic
saber rattling]{.underline}**]{.mark}. As seen from Moscow and
Washington D.C., an Arctic salami-tactic aiming to install fear,
uncertainty and ultimately coerce the other part to step down in the
Norwegian Sea has become irresponsible. **[[The fact that no provocative
incidents have been reported on either side of the Bear Gap
signifies]{.underline}]{.mark}** a **[[tacit
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}** between the two protagonists. U.S.
and Russian state leaders stick to a "gentleman's agreement". This is
not out of sympathy for each other but out of fear, anxiety and a mutual
respect for each other's destructive power.

Paradoxically, therefore, **[Russia's failed attempt to rapidly seize
Ukraine has led to more Arctic predictability]{.underline}**.
**[[Russia's failure to win]{.underline}]{.mark}** decisively in Eastern
Europe has, in relative terms, led to more crisis stability outside
Norway. The General Staff's military blunder and failed coup d'état in
Kyiv **[[has become a regional tranquilizer]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
one of the most sensitive operational areas on Earth. The finding
coincides with conclusions drawn by Kristian Åtland et al., claiming

> \[...\] the dominant pattern of Russia's sea and air exercises on
> NATO's northern flank has changed significantly in the time that has
> passed since February 2022. Particularly noteworthy is the shift in

The finding, however, must not be interpreted as a claim of Arctic
peacefulness. **[[Malign subwater activities with attack submarines,
underwater drones, and special forces preparing for sabotage]{.mark}
against critical infrastructure]{.underline}** on the seabed,
**[[accelerate]{.underline}]{.mark}**.84 **[This is also the case with
numerous civilian research and fishing vessels pursuing covert
operations below the threshold of war]{.underline}**. Examples are
possible sabotage against fiberoptic cables, mapping of gas pipelines,
hazardous maneuvers with jetfighters against personnel on oil rigs,
reconnaissance on critical objects, electronic jamming of GPS signals,
unexpected flows of refugees across borders, or outright provocations to
map adversaries' response time and readiness. These so-called
'**[[hybrid threats' are]{.underline}]{.mark}** nevertheless **[[less
dangerous]{.mark} than nuclear rivals aiming to "manipulate the shared
risk of war"]{.underline}**. **[[Malign operations below the threshold
of war are primarily a law enforcement issue]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
These challenges belong to the police rather than the military and
should primarily be seen as a perennial phenomenon evolving between
rivals.85 To Russia in particular, this modus operandi -- in crisis
short of war -- has become the most likely course of action due to
Russia's military inferiority vis-à-vis NATO and the United States.
Russia's secret services, like the FSB, GRU and SVR, is therefore a more
useful political instrument than the Northern Fleet or the Leningrad
Military District.

### No Arctic War---AT: Resource War---2NC

#### No resource conflicts in the Arctic -- incentives for cooperation outweigh motivations for conflict

**[Advocates of an]{.underline}** interest-driven **[arms race over the
North Pole]{.underline}** often **[point to]{.underline}** the growing
economic potential of the region, overlapping territorial claims, and an
increasing "**[militarization" of the Arctic]{.underline}** region.4
**[However, there are]{.underline}** good **[reasons]{.underline}**
**[to]{.underline}** more **[carefully examine the underlying
assumptions]{.underline}** about power and interests on which such
analyses are based. I would like to begin with the most commonly used
argument for the risk of military confrontation in the Arctic: the
region's enormous economic potential and the conflicting interests of
major Arctic stakeholders. In 2008, a US Geological Survey report
estimated that the Arctic probably contains the largest untapped oil and
gas reserves in the world.5 In addition, the increasing accessibility of
the Northwest Passage and the Northern Sea Route are of major economic
interest, as they considerably reduce the transit times between the
Atlantic and the Pacific while avoiding unsecure waters such as those
around the Horn of Africa.6 **[Controlling]{.underline}** both the
**[natural resources and]{.underline}** these **[shipping routes is
considered a matter of great significance]{.underline}** by the five
Arctic littoral states of Norway, Denmark, Canada, Russia, and the
United States. Their **[recent submissions under the]{.underline}**
United Nations Convention on **[the Law of the Sea]{.underline}**
(UNCLOS)7 for the extension of their continental shelves (and thus the
right to exploit the resources in the seabed) **[are seen by some as
provocative]{.underline}**, **[and overlaps among]{.underline}**
proposed are**[as of interest are believed to contain imminent potential
for conflict]{.underline}**.8 **[However]{.underline}**, a few major
points should be considered. First, **[the submissions]{.underline}** to
UNCLOS **[are in full accordance with international]{.underline}** law
and can hardly be described as provocative. They consist solely in the
filing of scientific data with the Commission on the Limits of the Con-
tinental Shelf (CLCS) on the extension of the littoral states'
continental shelves. The CLCS assesses the various submissions before
making recommendations on how to proceed. While the Commission has no
mandate to resolve overlapping claims, the UNCLOS refers to various
mechanisms for dispute settlement.9 The
**[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** littoral [**[states]{.underline}**
**[have]{.underline}**]{.mark} so far **[always [followed a path of
peaceful dispute settlement]{.mark}]{.underline}** and reaffirmed their
commitment to international law "and to the orderly settlement of any
possible overlapping claims"10 at the Arctic Ocean Conference in 2008 in
Ilulissat. With the signing of the border delimitation treaty between
Norway and Russia in 2010,11 only a few overlaps remain, with little
actual conflict potential.12 Considering that **[[resource extraction
far out in the Arctic Ocean is highly unlikely]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
the dispute between Canada, Denmark, and Russia over who owns the North
Pole is mainly symbolic, and, in 2015, **[[Russia]{.mark} already
[indicated]{.mark} its [readiness to negotiate]{.mark}]{.underline}**
its **[[overlapping claims]{.underline}]{.mark}** there.13 Disputes such
as the one over Hans Island (a "rock" in the Nares Strait between Canada
and Greenland) have even become "running gags", with military forces
from Canada and Denmark leaving bottles of Danish schnapps and Canadian
whisky on the island along with signs welcoming the other side.14
Finally, it is often overlooked that **[[the vast majority of]{.mark}
predicted [resources are located either within]{.mark}]{.underline}**
Exclusive Economic Zones (**[[EEZs]{.underline}]{.mark}**)
**[[or]{.mark} in [areas that are claimed by only one
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}** littoral **[[state]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
of which Russia has by far the largest share.15 In addition, **[[the
harsh Arctic climate makes resource extraction extremely difficult
and]{.underline}]{.mark}**, due to the lack of the necessary
infrastructure, approximately **[[twice as expensive]{.mark} as anywhere
else]{.underline}** in the world. This is particularly true for
extraction offshore, where it is assumed that most undiscovered
resources lie. Many studies thus conclude not only that it will remain
very expensive, but also that **[[it is highly unlikely that]{.mark} the
bulk of [Arctic resources will be allocated
unilaterally]{.mark}]{.underline}**.16 In other words, **[the
[Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}** littoral **[[states have the most to lose
from a military confrontation]{.mark}, as they are required to
co-operate for technical reasons if they want to access the economic
benefits of their regional share]{.underline}**. International sanctions
on oil and gas equipment following the illegal annexation of Crimea
have, for example, basically brought Russia's Arctic resource extraction
programmes to a complete halt.

**[[The harsh Arctic climate]{.underline}]{.mark}** not only has severe
consequences for the profitability of Arctic resource extraction, but
also **[[places practical constraints on]{.mark} the conduct of
[military operations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. With the large Arctic Ocean
covered in ice for most of the year, and temperatures that can drop
below minus 40 degrees Celsius, **[the overall [military
presence]{.mark} in the Arctic [is]{.mark} still relatively
[low]{.mark}]{.underline}** in comparison to other regions**[.
[Sustaining]{.mark} [military infrastructure]{.mark} and even conducting
military activities]{.underline}** (e.g. exercises) **[[are highly
expensive]{.mark} and pose severe challenges]{.underline}** to service
members and equipment. Consequently, **[[armed forces in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** region **[[are]{.underline}]{.mark}**
often **[more [a symbol]{.mark} of national sovereignty]{.underline}**
and prestige **[than of military power projection]{.underline}**. An
exemplary illustration is provided by the Danish elite navy unit
"Slædepatruljen Sirius" (Sirius Dog Sled Patrol). Studies have shown
that the extreme cold and darkness have a considerable impact on the
physical and psychological health of the participating soldiers.17 The
unit, consisting of twelve soldiers split up into dogsled teams of two,
patrols approximately 16,000 kilometres of coastline in Northern
Greenland.18 Due to the extremely low temperatures, the unit is equipped
with the M1917 Enfield, a bolt-action rifle used during the First World
War. More modern, gas-operated semi-automatic rifles are far less
reliable in the cold environment of Northern Greenland and put the
soldiers at greater risk of attack by polar bears. **[[The
Arctic]{.mark} also [places constraints]{.mark} on the deployment of
other conventional military equipment such as battle [tanks and heavy

**[seem]{.underline}** to be **[overstated]{.underline}**. **[Despite

**[[Arctic]{.mark} military [modernization]{.mark} and procurement

**[[proceed slowly or are]{.mark} even [completely called

safeguarding of territorial claims; instead, **[they are connected with

**[operations]{.underline}**.20 Looking, for example, at the sparsely
populated northern parts of Russia and Canada, it is not surprising that
these tasks are undertaken, or at least supported, by specifically
trained and equipped military personnel. As the former Chief of the
Canadian Defence Staff, General Walter Natynczyk, once put it: "If
someone were to invade the Canadian Arctic, my first task would be to
rescue them."21 To sum up, **[there are good reasons to believe that
[military conflict is highly unlikely to break out in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In fact, **[the harsh Arctic climate and
rudimentary infrastructure have always fostered particularly close
cooperation]{.underline}** in the sparsely populated High North, **[and
the]{.underline}** **[Arctic]{.underline}** littoral
**[states]{.underline}** in particular **[have much more to lose than to
gain from military confrontation]{.underline}** if they intend to make
the Arctic economically useable. In addition, **[the level of military
presence in the Arctic is often exaggerated, and many practical
constraints are usually overlooked]{.underline}**.

Hurdles to trilateral cooperation under Trump

**[[Trump's return]{.mark} to the White House [imperils the
trilateral]{.mark}]{.underline}** on two accounts.

First, unlike Biden, **[[Trump views alliances as dependencies]{.mark}
to be exploited]{.underline}** by extracting maximum benefits to suit
his America First agenda. **[[Trilateral cooperation will
struggle]{.mark} to muddle [through]{.mark} the
[volatility]{.mark}]{.underline}** and incongruency **[of bilateral
demands coming from]{.underline}** the **[Trump]{.underline}**
presidency towards not just one, but two, allies.

**[[Disagreements over cost-sharing of US forces in Japan and]{.mark}
South [Korea]{.mark}]{.underline}**, their
balance-of-**[[trade]{.underline}]{.mark}** with the US, Trump's plans

expenditure could]{.mark} all [affect the]{.mark} trilateral
[mechanism]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[[How Trump handles]{.mark} North Korea, [China and Russia could also
undermine trilateral cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Strategic
misalignment was already emerging at Munich.

The Japanese and South Korean foreign ministers spoke jointly about the
connectivity of the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific security theatres,
noting that the nature of a peace settlement in Ukraine will directly
affect East Asian security. Trump's team, meanwhile, could not have gone
farther to stress how it considers the two theatres as unambiguously
separate.

**[[Trump's penchant for dealing]{.mark} directly [with autocratic
leaders]{.mark}]{.underline}** to showcase his ability to extract the
best deals **[[will]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[[whittle the
trilateral's primary goals]{.underline}]{.mark}** and mode of
functioning, notably the 'Commitment to Consult' agreed at Camp David.

Second, **[US willingness to mediate between Japan and South Korea has
previously created space]{.underline}** amid the two nations' historic
animosities and contentious political issues.

With the US in the room, the Japan--South Korea relationship can be
framed on more strategic grounds where they can converge. Polling also
suggests strong domestic support in both countries for security
cooperation with a US presence to stabilize the Korean peninsula and
contain China's rise.

However, unlike his predecessors, **[[Trump did not facilitate diplomacy
between the two allies]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In 2018, relations
between Japan and South Korea had reached their lowest point since
normalization in 1965.

**[The two sides implemented export controls and suspended an

responded by scoffing, 'how many issues do I have to get involved in?'.

**[[Closer engagement between Russia and China has fueled assumptions of
an emerging axis]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[The Arctic is often cited as
evidence of Sino-Russian alignment due to their growing Arctic ties
across the security, strategic and commercial spheres]{.underline}**.
Beijing frames its Arctic relationship with Russia often in terms of
'win-win' agreements and strategies. This term, 'win-win', reflects
Beijing's Confucius thinking, and indicates that the two countries'
bilateral mutually beneficial interests in the region remain far short
of the increasingly popular assumption of a brewing Arctic alliance.
Resources and transportation (that is, the future history of global
maritime trade) are the two primary strategic interests driving China's
Arctic gambit. All components of the Arctic resource 'prize' are of
interest to Beijing and feature across various policy statements and
indeed within China's 2018 Arctic Strategy. As a burgeoning global trade
power, the ability to cut logistics costs and, indeed, transportation
times, is of central interest to China. Here, the Northern Sea Route
(NSR) -- largely hugging the Russian Arctic coastline -- links Asia to
Europe. Through the Arctic Ocean, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are
connected. Travel time between Asia and Europe via the NSR is about 23
days on average, compared with the Suez Canal's 37-day average. In 2013,
the first Chinese merchant ship transited the NSR and was the first
container vessel ever to do so. China's Arctic interest dates to 1925,
when it acceded to the Spitsbergen (now Svalbard) Treaty. The treaty
benefited the signatories economically by facilitating access to mining
rights on the Svalbard archipelago, while agreeing to protect Svalbard
from any military buildup. This Arctic archipelago's scientific and
research value was further tapped by China in 2004 when Beijing built
the Yellow River Arctic research station -- cementing Chinese presence
in the region. In addition, the Xue Long (Snow Dragon), China's first
icebreaker, has conducted numerous Arctic research expeditions since
1999. Today, it is joined by Xue Long-2, China's first indigenously
built icebreaker. Murmurs of a nuclear-powered icebreaker about to roll
off China's production yard further point to **[[Beijing's]{.mark}
growing [polar capability]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In securing observer
status to the Arctic Council in 2013, China inserted itself into the
Arctic governance ecosystem. But this **[[does not place Beijing at the
decision-making table]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- observers do not vote or
lead multilateral discussion within the Arctic Council. Beyond
transportation, Beijing seeks to diversify its energy imports across the
globe. This makes the resource-rich Russian Arctic Zone (both inland and
offshore) an attractive component of China's diversification strategy.
**[While the Sino-Russian Arctic relationship is predicated on economic
foundations]{.underline}**, for now, Russia has yet to fall into
Beijing's 'debt-trap diplomacy'. **[[Moscow maintains stringent domestic
legislation on joint ventures]{.mark} and ownership of sovereign energy
deposits]{.underline}**. This is a delicate balance. Russia relies on
sustained future Chinese demand for Arctic liquified natural gas (LNG),
but **[Moscow has also worked to diversify its capital
pools]{.underline}**. India, Japan, Saudi Arabia and South Korea are all
linked to Russian Arctic energy ventures in one way or another. China
does not have a majority share in either of the two key LNG projects on
the Russian Arctic's Yamal Peninsula. Beijing's share in the Yamal LNG
venture is 29.9%, while Russia's Novatek holds a controlling 50.1% and
France's Total holds 20%. In the Arctic-2 LNG project, China holds 20%,
Novatek 60%, Total 10%, and the remaining 10% is held by a Japanese
consortium. Russia's upcoming Arctic energy projects, located in
proximity to the existing Yamal Peninsula ventures Ob (LNG), Vostok
(oil), Arctic-1 (LNG) and Arctic-3 (LNG), can be expected to attract
diverse capital pools. Likewise, **[[on the]{.underline}]{.mark}** NSR
or '**[[polar silk road']{.mark} front, [Russia maintains the
upper]{.mark}]{.underline}** (controlling)
**[[hand]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The NSR wraps along the Russian
coastline for most of its route. This is important to Russia for two
reasons. First, much of the NSR falls within Russia's exclusive economic
zone (EEZ) and therefore **[Moscow has deemed it necessary to charge
transit tariffs]{.underline}**. The tariffs have been accompanied by
Russia's introduction of tight rules and domestic laws for foreign firms
looking to use the route. Second, **[Russia insists vessels can only
navigate]{.underline}** the NSR **[when accompanied by Russian nuclear
icebreakers]{.underline}**. Tapping into NSR potential is thus subject
to strict Russian directives. While mutually beneficial interests -- and
the overall sense of 'win-win' agreements -- facilitate close engagement
between Beijing and Moscow in the Arctic, **[it is]{.underline}** still
**[problematic to assume an Arctic 'axis' is forthcoming]{.underline}**.
**[China's]{.underline}** efforts to increase its **[engagement in the
Arctic are occurring far beyond the Russian Arctic Zone]{.underline}**.
Iceland was the first European state to sign a free-trade agreement with
Beijing, and China's first intergovernmental framework in the Arctic was
struck with Iceland in 2012. Various Chinese state energy interests have
been floated in geothermal resources in Iceland -- but to date the
projects have been abandoned. In 2018, the China--Iceland Arctic Science
Observatory opened and continues to operate. Iceland strategically
presents as a logistics hub that would act as a key shipping port
between Europe and Asia along the NSR. It seems clear that Chinese
Arctic strategy is to 'internationalise' the Arctic in a way that
features and promotes China's strategic benefit. **[China is also driven
by great power ideology]{.underline}** and the prestige afforded by
having a global polar footprint. **[Russia is aware of this simmering
rationale for Chinese Arctic strategy]{.underline}**. Efforts by China
to move beyond the agreed terms of its mutually beneficial arrangement
with Moscow within the Russian Arctic Zone, and how closely China
adheres to the existing legal and sovereign arrangements of the Arctic
Ocean, will certainly be a litmus test for the Sino-Russian Arctic
'alliance'. Indeed, **[[Sino-Russian strategic tensions
remain]{.underline}]{.mark}**, well beyond the overhanging fear of
centuries of mistrust and the issue of the Russian Far East. In June
2020, Moscow accused one of its leading Arctic scientists, Valery Mitko,
of spying for Beijing. Mitko was charged with treason for handing over
classified information on Arctic research and submarine sensor
technology to China. But perhaps more telling is the way that both
countries have hushed up the incident, with neither formally commenting
on the arrest. For now, Beijing and Moscow appear to agree to disagree
-- so long as Arctic LNG business is booming. The narrative of Moscow
and Beijing working together to carve up the Arctic riches and take
control of new global transport corridors has started to make its way
into the policy and defence planning documents of Arctic-rim states.
Washington's litany of Arctic strategic planning documents -- Naval, Air
Force and Coast Guard strategies -- feature renewed great power
competition in the Arctic as a central security threat. However, **[the
notion that there is a Sino-Russian Arctic alliance is a
misinterpretation of the realities that drive China and Russia together
in the Arctic]{.underline}**. The realities of the Sino-Russian
relationship (dubbed by both as one of 'mutual benefit') in the Arctic
is best grasped when the limits of the partnership are considered.
**[There are]{.underline}**, first and foremost**[, limits in terms of
geographical boundaries]{.underline}**. **[The [Russian Arctic
Zone]{.mark} is the lion's share of the Arctic region]{.underline}**,
home to the NSR and a vast percentage of Arctic resources.
**[The]{.underline}** Russian Arctic **[Zone [is]{.mark} also
[the]{.mark} geographical '[limit' of Sino-Russian Arctic 'cooperation'
as well]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Of the eight members of the Arctic
Council, Russia took the most convincing to grant China its observer
status in 2013. Moscow approved membership, and with it, legitimacy, on
the basis that Beijing explicitly acknowledged the sovereignty of
Arctic-rim states and reaffirmed its commitment to the legal
architecture of the Arctic region -- the UN Convention on the Law of the
Sea. Russia watches, with tempered suspicion, Beijing's Arctic high sea
missions and scientific research agenda in what China sees as a global
commons. Yet within the Russian Arctic Zone, **[Russia welcomes Chinese
engagement, but on Kremlin terms]{.underline}**. Since 2014, with
Western sanctions over Russia's annexation of Crimea and sustained
aggression in Ukraine, Moscow has had a cashflow problem.
**[Despite]{.underline}** key economic strategic **[partnerships in the
Russian Arctic, China is busy diversifying itself throughout the
region]{.underline}**. China is actively engaging with other Arctic-rim
powers and has commercial ventures, investment plans and entrenched
soft-power strategies in Norway, Canada, Iceland and Denmark (through
Greenland). Russia's Arctic strategy is built on both economic security
and frontier border security objectives. The Sino-Russian relationship
lends itself to these economic security interests and ambitions, but it
is less effective at navigating Russia's Arctic 'siege mentality'. This
is largely because of the kind of increased interest and activity that
China is undertaking in the Arctic -- and against which Russia seeks to
secure its vast open frontier. **[Any deterioration in Sino-Russian ties
could threaten this delicate balance]{.underline}**. Russian efforts to
securitise its economic interests in the Arctic fall short of an
expansionist agenda. Beyond the posturing, ultimately Moscow's Arctic
priority remains regional stability. Continued regional cooperation with
its NATO-member and Western Arctic neighbours remains a central
strategic objective. After all, keeping the arena free of conflict is
crucial to ensuring the NSR (and Russia's future economic resource base)
remains open and commercially viable. Russia needs to be able to deliver
secure, trusted and unimpeded energy supplies from its northern frontier
to Asian and European energy clients. The same cannot be assumed of
Chinese Arctic interests, with clear indicators of an emerging
expansionist agenda. While much of Beijing's recent Arctic Ocean
missions have been primarily about 'raising the flag' and promoting
soft-power public relations campaigns for domestic consumption, it is
evident that China is set to stay in the Arctic. While much of the
Arctic Ocean is delineated by territorial seas and agreed maritime
boundaries, the central Arctic Ocean does hold international waters,
which facilitates Chinese engagement. **[[Fragmentation of Sino-Russian
relations]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the Arctic context **[[might]{.mark}
yet [emerge from the outcomes of the Arctic continental shelf
debate]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Via the UN Commission on the Limits of
the Continental Shelf, Russia, Canada and Denmark have all submitted
formal, yet overlapping, claims to this continental shelf. Should a
claim be upheld, the awarded state will then claim exclusive rights to
the seabed and the resources beneath the area of the North Pole. This
would block China's access to seabed or resources in the international
Arctic waters around the North Pole. Overall, **[continued efforts to
put Moscow and Beijing in the same 'basket' when it comes to great power
competition in the Arctic 'great game' is short-sighted and misses
critical opportunities to futureproof the Arctic as a zone of
international cooperation, collaboration and low tension]{.underline}**.
Sino-Russian Arctic ties will continue to be predictable to a large
extent. Ties will remain mutually beneficial -- until they are not.
Predicting this point should be the priority for Arctic stakeholders.
The problem appears to be, for now, that many stakeholders assume a
fractured or fragmented Sino-Russian Arctic relationship does not exist.
**[[Russia and China's Arctic relationship is not an
alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- it is driven by 'win-win' thinking.
Such framing is extremely subjective and prone to change. Despite
mutually beneficial interests in the region**[, commercial realpolitik
is at the heart of their engagement]{.underline}**. For now, the
partnership in the Arctic navigates existing fault lines elsewhere, such
as Beijing's failure to acknowledge Russia's annexation of Crimea and
Moscow's nonalignment in the developing India--China conflict.
**[Sino-Russian mutually beneficial cooperation and engagement within
the Russian Arctic Zone is not a Sino-Russian alliance in the
Arctic]{.underline}**. In a somewhat Confucius-informed position,
Beijing wants to 'seek harmony and keep differences' when it comes to
engagement with Russia in the Arctic. Both countries will remain engaged
proactively and collaboratively across industrialisation projects,
diplomatic relations and various commercial dealings in the Russian
Arctic Zone. But when this 'win-win' situation sours, Western Arctic
states may indeed be faced with another Arctic security threat -- a
conflict between Russia and China in the Arctic.

In public, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia says his country's
growing friendship with China is unshakable --- a strategic military and
economic collaboration that has entered a golden era. But in the
corridors of Lubyanka, the headquarters of **[[Russia's]{.mark} domestic
[security agency]{.mark}]{.underline}**, known as the F.S.B., a
secretive intelligence unit **[[refers to the Chinese as "the
enemy]{.mark}."]{.underline}** This unit, which has not previously been
disclosed, has warned that China is a serious threat to Russian
security. **[[Its officers say]{.mark} that [Beijing is]{.mark}
increasingly [trying to recruit Russian spies]{.mark} and get its hands
on sensitive military technology]{.underline}**, at times by luring
disaffected Russian scientists. The intelligence officers say that China
is spying on the Russian military's operations in Ukraine to learn about
Western weapons and warfare. They fear that Chinese academics are laying
the groundwork to make claims on Russian territory. And **[they have
warned that Chinese intelligence agents are carrying out espionage in
the Arctic]{.underline}** using mining firms and university research
centers as cover. The threats are laid out in an eight-page internal
F.S.B. planning document, obtained by The New York Times, that sets
priorities for fending off Chinese espionage. The document is undated,
raising the possibility that it is a draft, though it appears from
context to have been written in late 2023 or early 2024. Ares Leaks, a
cybercrime group, obtained the document but did not say how it did so.
That makes definitive authentication impossible, but The Times shared
the report with six Western intelligence agencies, all of which assessed
it to be authentic. **[The document gives the most detailed
behind-the-scenes view to date of Russian counterintelligence's thinking
about China]{.underline}**. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February
2022, Moscow's new bond with Beijing has shifted the global balance of
power. The rapidly expanding partnership is one of the most
consequential, and opaque, relationships in modern geopolitics. Russia
has survived years of Western financial sanctions following the
invasion, proving wrong the many politicians and experts who predicted
the collapse of the country's economy. That survival is in no small part
due to China. China is the largest customer for Russian oil and provides
essential computer chips, software and military components. When Western
companies fled Russia, Chinese brands stepped in to replace them. The
two countries say they want to collaborate in a vast number of areas,
including making movies and building a base on the moon. Mr. Putin and
Xi Jinping, China's leader, are doggedly pursuing what they call a
partnership with "no limits." But the top-secret F.S.B. memo shows there
are, in fact, limits. "You have the political leadership, and these guys
are all for rapprochement with China," said Andrei Soldatov, an expert
on Russia's intelligence services who lives in exile in Britain and who
reviewed the document at the request of The Times. "You have the
intelligence and security services, and they are very suspicious." Mr.
Putin's spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, declined to comment. The Chinese
Foreign Ministry did not respond to requests for comment on the
document. **[[The Russian document describes a "tense and dynamically
developing" intelligence battle]{.mark} in the shadows between the two
outwardly friendly nations.]{.underline}** Three days before Mr. Putin
invaded Ukraine in 2022, the F.S.B. approved a new counterintelligence
program called "Entente-4," the document reveals. The code name, an
apparent tongue-in-cheek reference to Moscow's growing friendship with
Beijing, belied the initiative's real intent: to prevent Chinese spies
from undermining Russian interests. The timing almost certainly was not
accidental. Russia was diverting nearly all of its military and spy
resources to Ukraine, more than 4,000 miles from its border with China,
and most likely worried that Beijing could try to capitalize on this
distraction. Since then, according to the document, the F.S.B. observed
China doing just that. Chinese intelligence agents stepped up efforts to
recruit Russian officials, experts, journalists and businesspeople close
to power in Moscow, the document says. To counter this, the F.S.B.
instructed its officers to intercept the "threat" and "prevent the
transfer of important strategic information to the Chinese." Officers
were ordered to conduct in-person meetings with Russian citizens who
work closely with China and warn them that Beijing was trying to take
advantage of Russia and obtain advanced scientific research, according
to the document. The F.S.B. ordered "the constant accumulation of
information about users" on the Chinese messaging app WeChat. That
included hacking phones of espionage targets and analyzing the data in a
special software tool held by a unit of the F.S.B., the document says.
The possible long-term alignment of two authoritarian governments, with
a combined population of nearly 1.6 billion people and armed with some
6,000 nuclear warheads, has stoked deep concern in Washington. Some
members of the Trump administration believe that, through outreach to
Mr. Putin, Washington can begin to peel Russia away from China and avoid
what Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called "two nuclear powers
aligned against the United States." "I'm going to have to un-unite them,
and I think I can do that, too," Donald J. Trump said shortly before his
election in November. "I have to un-unite them." Read one way, the
F.S.B. document lends credence to the theory that, with the right
approach, Russia can be cleaved away from China. The document describes
mistrust and suspicion on both sides of the relationship. China is
conducting polygraphs on its agents as soon as they return home,
tightening scrutiny of the 20,000 Russian students in China and trying
to recruit Russians with Chinese spouses as potential spies, the
document says. But another reading of the document leads to the opposite
conclusion. The fact that Mr. Putin is apparently well aware of the
risks of a closer relationship with China and has decided to push ahead
anyway could suggest little opportunity for the United States to get
Russia to change course. "Putin believes that he can go much deeper into
this Chinese embrace, and it's not risk free, but it is worth it," said
Alexander Gabuev, the director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center,
who reviewed the document at the request of The Times. "But we also see
there are people within the system who are skeptical of that approach."
Mr. Putin has courted Mr. Xi for years, in more than 40 personal
meetings, and has cemented a far deeper partnership with China since
invading Ukraine. The two countries have a natural economic synergy,
with Russia being one of the world's largest energy producers and China
the world's largest energy consumer. That poses a delicate challenge for
Russian counterintelligence agents. The document shows them trying to
contain the risks posed by Chinese intelligence without causing
"negative consequences for bilateral relations." Officers were warned to
avoid any public "mention of the Chinese intelligence services as a
potential enemy." Most likely written for circulation to F.S.B. field
offices, the directive offers a rare glimpse into the inner world of one
of the most powerful parts of the Russian intelligence establishment:
the F.S.B.'s Department for Counterintelligence Operations, known as the
D.K.R.O. The document was written by the D.K.R.O.'s 7th Service, which
is responsible for countering espionage from China and other parts of
Asia. **[Anxiety about Russia's susceptibility to an increasingly
powerful Beijing dominates the memo.]{.underline}** But it is unclear
how common those worries are across the Russian establishment, beyond
the counterintelligence unit. Even allied nations regularly spy on one
another. "To go back to the old adage, there is no such thing as
friendly intel services," said Paul Kolbe, a senior fellow at Harvard's
Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, who served for 25
years in the C.I.A. Directorate of Operations, including in Russia. "You
don't have to scratch very deep in any Russian military or intel
official to get deep suspicion of China. In the long run, China is, in
spite of the unlimited partnership and how useful they are, also a
potential threat." Soon after Russian troops pushed across the border
into Ukraine, officials from Chinese defense firms and institutes tied
to Chinese intelligence began flooding into Russia. Their goal,
according to the F.S.B. document, was to better understand the war.
China has world-class scientists, but its military has not fought a war
since a monthlong conflict with Vietnam in 1979. The result is anxiety
in China about how its military would perform against Western weapons in
a conflict over Taiwan or the South China Sea. Chinese intelligence
officials are eager to understand Russia's fight against an army backed
by the West. "Of particular interest to Beijing is information about
combat methods using drones, modernization of their software and methods
for countering new types of Western weapons," the F.S.B. document says,
adding that Beijing believes the war in Ukraine will become drawn-out.
The conflict has revolutionized warfare technology and tactics. China
has long lagged behind Russia in its aviation expertise, and the
document says that Beijing has made that a priority target. China is
targeting military pilots and researchers in aerohydrodynamics, control
systems and aeroelasticity. Also being sought out, according to the
document, are Russian specialists who worked on the discontinued
ekranoplan, a hovercraft-type warship first deployed by the Soviet
Union. "Priority recruitment is given to former employees of aircraft
factories and research institutes, as well as current employees who are
dissatisfied with the closure of the ekranoplan development program by
the Russian Ministry of Defense or who are experiencing financial
difficulties," the report says. It is not clear from the document
whether those recruitment efforts are limited to hiring Russian
specialists for Chinese ventures or also extend to recruiting them as
spies. The document also shows that Russia is very concerned about how
China views the war in Ukraine and is trying to feed Beijing's spies
with positive information about Russian operations. And it commands
Russian counterintelligence operatives to prepare a report for the
Kremlin about any possible changes in Beijing's policy. Western leaders
have accused China of providing Russia with essential weapons components
and working to conceal it. The F.S.B. document lends support to that
claim, stating that Beijing had proposed establishing supply chains to
Moscow that circumvent Western sanctions and had offered to participate
in the production of drones and other unspecified high-tech military
equipment. The document does not say whether those proposals were
carried out, though China has supplied Russia with drones. The F.S.B.
memo also hints at Chinese interest in the Wagner mercenary group, a
Russia-backed paramilitary group that propped up governments in Africa
for years and fought alongside Russian troops in Ukraine. "The Chinese
plan to use the experience of Wagner fighters in their own armed forces
and private military companies operating in the countries of Southeast
Asia, Africa and Latin America," the directive says. The wording of the
report does not indicate whether the F.S.B. believes that China wants to
recruit former Wagner fighters for its own formations or simply wants to
learn from their experience. **[[Russia has long feared encroachment by
China]{.mark} along their shared]{.underline}** 2,615-mile
**[border]{.underline}**. And Chinese nationalists for years have taken
issue with 19th-century treaties in which Russia annexed large portions
of land, including modern-day Vladivostok. **[[That issue is now of key
concern]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[with Russia weakened by the war and
economic sanctions and less able than ever to push back against
Beijing.]{.underline}** **[The]{.underline}** F.S.B. **[report raises
concerns that some academics in China have been promoting territorial
claims against Russia.]{.underline}** China is searching for traces of
"ancient Chinese peoples" in the Russian Far East, possibly to influence
local opinion that is favorable to Chinese claims, the document says. In
2023, China published an official map that included historical Chinese
names for cities and areas within Russia. The F.S.B. ordered officers to
expose such "revanchist" activities, as well as attempts by China to use
Russian scientists and archival funds for research aimed at attaching a
historical affiliation to borderlands. "Conduct preventative work with
respect to Russian citizens involved in the said activities," the memo
orders. "Restrict entry into our country for foreigners as a measure of
influence." **[The concerns about China expanding its reach are not
limited to Russia's Far East borderlands]{.underline}**. Central Asian
countries answered to Moscow during the Soviet era. Today, the F.S.B.
reports, Beijing has developed a "new strategy" to promote Chinese soft
power in the region. China began rolling out that strategy in
Uzbekistan, according to the document. The details of the strategy are
not included in the document other than to say it involves humanitarian
exchange. Uzbekistan and neighboring countries are important to Mr.
Putin, who sees restoring the Soviet sphere of influence as part of his
legacy. **[[The report also highlights China's interest in Russia's vast
territory in the Arctic and the Northern Sea
Route]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which hugs Russia's northern coast.
Historically, those waters have been too icy for reliable shipping, but
they are expected become increasingly busy because of climate change.
The route slashes shipping time between Asia and Europe. Developing that
route would make it easier for China to sell its goods. **[[Russia
historically tried to maintain strict control over Chinese activity in
the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But Beijing believes that Western
sanctions will force Russia to turn to China to maintain its "aging
Arctic infrastructure," according to the F.S.B. document. Already, the
Russian gas giant Novatek has relied on China to salvage its Arctic
liquefied natural gas project, after previously using the American oil
services firm Baker Hughes. **[The F.S.B. asserts that Chinese spies are
active in the Arctic]{.underline}**, as well. **[The report says Chinese
intelligence is trying to obtain information about Russia's development
of the Arctic,]{.underline}** using institutions of higher education and
mining companies in particular. But despite all of these
vulnerabilities, the F.S.B. report makes clear that jeopardizing the
support of China would be worse. The document squarely warns officers
that they must receive approval from the highest echelons of the Russian
security establishment before taking any sensitive action at all.

#### Incompatible strategic cultures limit Russian-Chinese Cooperation in the Arctic -- long-term power dynamics thump short-term cooperation

Jørgen **Staun** **and** Camilla T. N. **Sørensen**, **2023**,
Scandinavian Journal of Military Studies, 6(1), 24-39, "Incompatible
Strategic Cultures Limit Russian-Chinese Strategic Cooperation in the
Arctic," https://sjms.nu/articles/10.31374/sjms.178, mm

**[While they share the overall focus on confronting]{.underline}** what
both Moscow and Beijing see as **[a hostile]{.underline}** and
threatening **[U.S.,]{.underline}** **[[Russia and China have
conflicting ends]{.mark} when it comes to their views on their
respective roles in the future international system. Russia wants to be
a leading great power]{.underline}** but realize that role will become
increasingly difficult if the world moves towards a bipolar standoff
between China and the U.S. [**[Even if China officially adheres to
multipolarity]{.underline}**, **[it]{.underline}**]{.mark} increasingly
measures and **[[positions itself solely in relation to the
U.S]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[China]{.underline}** thus **[assesses its
strategic cooperation with Russia in terms of the benefits this
cooperation brings in China's confrontation with the U.S]{.underline}**.
**[[As the power asymmetry continues to grow to China's
advantage]{.mark}, [it is highly likely that a more confident Beijing
will]{.mark} increasingly [feel entitled to set the tone]{.mark} in the
strategic partnership with Russia and will push for emphasis on Chinese
concepts and ideas]{.underline}** -- on the development of the future
international order, for example. We are already seeing strong signs of
this, most recently in the 2022 Joint Statement, in which Beijing
expressed support for the Russian critique of NATO enlargement for the
first time. When it came to describing the preferred international
development, however, Chinese concepts and ideas were clearly dominant
(President of Russia, 2022). **[To leave the dominant role and the
initiative to China does not come easily for Russia, being incompatible
with Russian great power identity. The Russian reservation shines
through in some of the formulations of its official
statements:]{.underline}** The Russian side notes the significance of
the concept of constructing a "community of common destiny for mankind"
proposed by the Chinese side to ensure greater solidarity of the
international community and consolidation of efforts in responding to
common challenges (President of Russia, 2022). According to Lukin (2021,
p. 166), **[Beijing's intensified effort to push Chinese concepts and
official statements on various issues and thus to shape the narrative of
joint declarations and treaties provokes a growing discontent in
Russia]{.underline}**. As seen in the 2022 Joint Statement, Russia has
accepted the Chinese concept of "community of common destiny" as well as
"the new era of Sino-Russian relations" -- but not without internal
dissent (see Denisov & Lukin, 2021, pp. 545--546). Such **[[internal
dissent in Russia is likely to grow]{.mark} with the increase in Chinese
confidence and assertiveness]{.underline}**. **[As China develops its
goal of becoming a world class military power and a maritime great
power, Russia's deeply ingrained insecurity and feeling of vulnerability
will also grow]{.underline}**. As demonstrated above, **[[it will be
particularly so in the Arctic]{.mark}, [given that Russia's great power
identity is closely connected to the region]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[[Moscow will]{.mark} therefore [find it extremely difficult
to]{.mark} make room for and to [accommodate China]{.mark} as the
leading great power there.]{.underline}** In other words: **[while
Russia and China have expanded their strategic cooperation in the Arctic
in recent years, [there are serious stumbling blocks to further
expansion]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Russia wants to retain its position
as the leading power in the Arctic and to preserve the privileges of the
Arctic states in relation to Arctic governance. Such ends will
increasingly be challenged by a more assertive China]{.underline}**
insisting on being respected and included in the region as a great
power, and on gaining a decisive role and influence on the region's
governance regime. As mentioned above, China shows a preference for
non-Arctic specific agreements and regulations, which until now has been
met with strong resistance in Russia. Here it is worth noting the
statement by the Russian Foreign Ministry's Special Envoy to the Arctic,
Nikolay Korchunov that it is impossible to disagree with U.S. Secretary
of State Michael Pompeo's statement made in May 2019 that there are two
groups of countries --- Arctic and non-Arctic ... He said so in relation
to China, which positioned itself as a near-Arctic state. We disagree
with this (quoted in Wishnick, 2021) In this one sentence, Korchunov
says that China, in Russia's view, is not an Arctic state and therefore
should not enjoy comparable rights. Arctic governance, in other words,
is for Arctic states. It should be remembered that Russia initially
opposed China's observer status in the Arctic Council until China agreed
to recognize the privileges and rights of the Arctic states (Wishnick,
2020, p. 6). However, Beijing has since gradually moved and is
increasingly challenging Russia's -- and the other Arctic states' --
position in line with its overall ambition of becoming "rule-maker"
instead of "rule-taker". Increasing Chinese lawfare activities,
especially, are to meet strong resistance in Russia. **[[Seen from
Moscow, it is crucial to maintain and demonstrate Russian sovereignty in
the Russian Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Moscow, in other words, will
not allow serious questions or challenges to its economic sovereignty or
to its security, its military dominance, in the Russian Arctic. Such
challenges are not unthinkable, however, should the Chinese military,
through dual-use activities and facilities, increase its presence in the
region, or if Chinese companies (large state-owned shipping,
infrastructure construction or resource-extraction companies, for
example) or banks gain a dominant stake in projects in the Russian
Arctic. Indeed, following Western sanctions associated with the war in
Ukraine, such scenarios have become more likely. It is not only a
question of the Russian side losing control over the projects and
missing out on actual profit or other material gains, but also the
potential for the area to be decreasingly recognized as Russian
territory, a vital constituent of the Russian sphere of influence and,
hence, a pillar of Russian great power status**[. If Moscow is no longer
able to uphold the picture of Russia as the Arctic great power, it will
cost it the recognition and respect more generally of it being a great
powe]{.underline}**r. Consequently, **[it is likely that Russia and
China]{.underline}**, **[sharing complementary interests and a
perception of a hostile U.S., should remain committed to further
developing their strategic cooperation in the Arctic in the near
term]{.underline}**. They will thus seek to manage the sources of
concern and tension. And due to its dire economic position as a
consequence of the war in Ukraine, Russia will most likely be able and
willing to accept more than it otherwise would. We may be partly seeing
the framework for this being set in the new Foreign Policy Concept from
2023, where it is stated that Russia in the Arctic will give priority to
"establishing mutually beneficial cooperation with non-Arctic states
pursuing a constructive policy towards Russia and interested in carrying
out international activities in the Arctic, including the
infrastructural development of the Northern Sea Route" (Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, 2023). In our view, this is mainly addressed to China.
Taken together with Russia's new borne reservations vis-à-vis the Arctic
Council and other multilateral Arctic fora and prioritisation of
"relations with foreign states on a bilateral basis", as stated in the
amendments to its 2020 Arctic strategy (2023), it points towards more
Russian-Chinese cooperation in the Arctic in the near future and
possibly also further alignment of Russian interests with Chinese
wishes. **[In the long run, however]{.underline}**, **[we argue that
[widespread accommodation to China is not
sustainable]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[as Russia will not accept its
relatively declining position]{.mark} and excessive dependence on
China]{.underline}**. **[Besides being incompatible with the Russian
great power identity,]{.underline}** with **[time it will also come to
restrict Russia's policy options and force unwelcomed
concessions]{.underline}**. **[[The Chinese side]{.mark},]{.underline}**
employing its ways and means more assertively, **[[will come to be less
diligent in its reassurances]{.mark} and respect concerning Russia's
need for great power recognition.]{.underline}**

#### Trump is actively destroying democracy and the rule of law

**Pilkington 25**, chief reporter for Guardian US. (Ed, 3-9-2025,
"'**[Nothing like this in American history': [the crisis of Trump's
assault on the rule of law]{.mark}]{.underline}**"
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/mar/09/trump-assault-rule-of-law?scrlybrkr=04ba8ef9)
wtk

**[[Trump]{.mark} has]{.underline}** done more than that -- he has
**[[opened]{.underline}]{.mark}** a **[[Pandora's
box]{.underline}]{.mark}** that might, in time, give the chief justice
pause. **[The president has]{.underline}** indicated that he has
**[another target]{.underline}** in his sights: **[the]{.underline}**
very **[judiciary]{.underline}** over which Roberts presides.

"He who saves his Country does not violate any law," Trump posted on
Musk's X earlier this month, channeling Napoleon Bonaparte. The comment,
combined with overt threats that Trump and his people have made against
judges who dare stand in their way, have prompted a question that
previously would have been unthinkable: is the president willing to defy
the rule of law itself?

"We've seen the many ways in which **[[Trump]{.mark} has sought to
[undermine]{.mark} Congress]{.underline}**, **[and now he's
seeking]{.underline}** to undermine **[[the judicial
bench]{.underline}]{.mark}**," said Nancy Gertner, a Harvard law school
professor. "**[This is a president who is arrogating to himself the
powers of a dictator]{.underline}**."

For 17 years, until she retired in 2011, Gertner sat as a federal judge
in the district court of Massachusetts. There she dealt with the
defiance of individual defendants.

"I had people who had been sentenced and didn't follow the rules of
their release, for sure," she said.

Not once in almost two decades of service, however, did she have to
confront a public officeholder openly flouting her authority.
"Governmental officials defying the court? It never came up. Literally,
never happened."

Now Gertner is observing [**[Trump's belligerence towards the
courts]{.underline}** **[unfold]{.underline}**]{.mark} with mounting
concern. "**[[There's been nothing like this in American
history]{.underline}]{.mark}**. There have been people who threatened
not to obey the law, especially post the civil war, but [**[this is
a]{.underline}** **[sustained attack on the
courts]{.underline}**]{.mark} we haven't seen before."

#### He is using small boosts in popularity to dismantle US institutions

**Evans-Pritchard 25**, World Economy Editor of The Daily Telegraph.
(Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, 6-19-2025, "**[[We are witnessing the death of
American democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}**"

**[What]{.underline}** Donald **[[Trump]{.mark} has done by
[activating]{.mark} the]{.underline}** California **[[National Guard
against the protest of the governor, and]{.mark} then [bringing
in]{.mark} US [Marines]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- both of which his
critics argue are unconstitutional -- **[is]{.underline}** a very light
version of Preußenschlag, but in some ways it is
**[worse]{.underline}**. The street protests in Los Angeles were the
result of his own theatrical stunt. You could be forgiven for thinking
he deliberately provoked the alleged "rebellion" in order to set this
precedent.

One can see now why Trump moved so fast to purge the top echelons of the
US defence department, including the three judge advocates general.
These officials rule on whether military orders are legal, and when they
should be disobeyed. They are legally independent by Congressional
statute.

Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary, told us why they had been sacked:
it was to stop them posing any "roadblocks to orders given by the
commander-in-chief".

Did **[Trump]{.underline}** mean it when he **[[told his generals
to]{.mark} "just [shoot]{.mark}" American
[protesters]{.mark}]{.underline}** during the Black Lives Matter riots
in 2020? We may find out.

**[He]{.underline}** also **[[fired the chairman of the joint chiefs of
staff]{.underline}]{.mark}** and others deemed symbols of "diversity,
equity, and inclusion", although one might suspect another motive.

An earlier chairman -- General Mark Milley -- refused to ratify the
Putsch of Jan 6 2021, and therefore stopped it stone dead. "We don't
take an oath to a king, or to a tyrant or dictator. We take an oath to
the Constitution," he said.

**[Trump is attacking California on several fronts at
once]{.underline}**, shrewdly **[judging that]{.underline}** Governor
Gavin **[Newsom is the perfect foil]{.underline}**. He is stripping the
state of its powers under the Clean Power Act to impose tougher
pollution rules than federal levels. He has signed an order blocking
California's plan to phase out petrol cars by 2035, and another stopping
it capping nitrogen oxide emissions. He now is threatening to withhold
federal disaster aid for wildfires.

Trump called him "Governor Newscum" and added in his inimitable style:
"You know, hatred is never a good thing in politics. When you don't like
somebody, you don't respect somebody, it's harder for that person to get
money if you're on top."

Forgive me for sounding jaundiced, but decades ago I covered the
Republican crusade under Speaker Newt Gingrich to restore states rights
and check the usurpations of federal power. Gingrich and his party are
now egging on the federal military occupation of states that stand in
Trump's way.

James Carville, veteran Democratic strategist and Clinton-fixer, says
the Democrats should bide their time and "play possum", betting that
Trump will self-destruct under the contradictions of his own policies.
The bond markets will do the job for them. Congress will drop back into
Democrat hands like a ripe fruit in the 2026 mid-terms.

I never expected to find myself impugning the ruthless Mr Carville for
credulous naivety. Declaration of interest: he once carried out a black
ops campaign against me personally from an office in the White House,
which I no doubt deserved, all is forgiven anyway.

Playing possum is what the German Social Democrats did in the early
1930s. Reading the first two volumes of Sir Richard Evans's magisterial
trilogy, The Coming of the Third Reich and The Third Reich in Power, I
am struck again and again by the refusal of the moderate middle to face
up to what was happening. They had a touching faith that the courts
would save them.

But the judges were ideologically captured, or frightened, or did what
most human beings do in turbulent times: they pre-emptively adapted to
keep their families out of trouble.

The Social Democrats made another fatal error. They assumed that
Hitler's eccentric mish-mash of economic policies would lead quickly to
a crisis, greatly underestimating the lift from neo-Keynesian
rearmament, so like Trump's gargantuan deficits.

American democracy has much deeper roots but **[[the imminent bombing of
Iran by the US air force gives pause for thought]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
There may be excellent reasons to knock out Iran's nuclear capability,
though doing in this way, flippantly, like a power-drunk despot,
conflating non-proliferation with regime change, drives the final nail
in the coffin of Western moral credibility.

That said, polls suggest that almost 80pc of **[[Americans would applaud
the destruction of the Fordow nuclear site]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and
most would support cutting off the head of the serpent in Tehran.
**[Trump might face a Maga revolt on the edges but [the]{.mark} larger
[bounce in popularity would let him steam roll opposition to his tariff
war, his climate war, and his "beautiful big
bill"]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- a giant transfer of income from poor to
rich. I don't believe Steven Bannon's warning that intervention will
"tear the country apart", unless the bombing mission goes awry.

[**[The strongman glow will open the window further for Trump's takeover
of the deep state]{.underline}**. **[He has already fired the heads of
the FBI's intelligence, counterterrorism, criminal
investigations]{.underline}**]{.mark}, as well as the heads of the
Washington and New York offices. He has purged the justice department,
now run by a Lord High Executioner from The Mikado, openly touting an
enemies list of "conspirators". He has forced private law firms to bend
the knee.

**[[He has put in a loyalist in charge of the
CIA]{.underline}]{.mark}**, who inconveniently reported in March that
Iran was not building a nuclear weapon. But that was then, when Trump
stood for America First, and staying out of forever wars was policy. He
has fired the head of the eaves-dropping National Security Agency and
its top officials. He has purged the head of the Federal Trade
Commission, who is independent by law, like the chairman of the Federal
Reserve.

**[America in 2025]{.underline}** is obviously not Germany in 1932. The
Weimar republic was already a cauldron of political violence. That year
was the worst of the Great Depression. The country was seething with
rage over the cultivated myths of the 1918 "stab in the back" and the
Carthaginian peace of Versailles.

It is even less like Germany in 1933 when the Nazis used their three
cabinet seats to take over the Prussian and federal interior ministries.
Within five months the Social Democrats leadership was dead, or in
Dachau, or in exile. All rival parties were shut down. No independent
newspaper survived. Every organisation from the labour unions, to male
choirs, sports teams and beekeeper clubs came under Nazi control.

But it **[is not the same America]{.underline}** that was my home for
long stretches **[of the late 20th century]{.underline}**. **[[Over the
last few days alone]{.mark}: [a Democratic]{.mark} US [senator was
manhandled to the floor]{.mark}, handcuffed and dragged away for asking
a question; [the]{.mark} Democrat [comptroller of New York was
seized]{.mark} and handcuffed by masked federal agents after demanding
to see a judicial warrant; [a Democratic state legislator in Minnesota
was murdered]{.mark} with her husband at home, and a state senator was
shot and badly wounded, both by an assassin with a hit list of 45
officials.]{.underline}**

Judges have so far issued more than 60 rulings that curb or restrain
Trump's legal overreach. A shocking number have either been threatened,
directly or through their families, or face calls for impeachment.

"[**[Our constitutional system depends on judges who can make decisions
free from threats and intimidation]{.underline}**,"]{.mark} warned judge
Robert Conrad, director of the administrative office of the US courts,
in testimony to Congress. To no avail: the House judiciary committee
shrugged it off, more or less blaming the victims.

**[[The drift of events was disturbing]{.mark} even before Iran offered
Trump a fresh gift from Mars. I fear that [many more lines in the sand
will be crossed]{.mark} in the heady aftermath of a surgical video war
on the Ayatollah, if that is where we are headed.]{.underline}**

#### Checks and balances fail---he'll force a legitimacy crisis

**Kanu 25**, Prospect staff writer and award-winning reporter (Hassan
Ali Kanu, 1-31-2025, "The Trump Administration Will Truly Test the
Supreme Court"
https://prospect.org/justice/2025-01-31-trump-administration-test-supreme-court-tiktok/)
wtk

**[[The]{.underline}]{.mark}** U.S. Supreme [**[Court
will]{.underline}**]{.mark} likely **[[undergo]{.mark}
[a]{.mark}]{.underline}**n even **[[greater institutional stress
test]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[during]{.underline}** President Donald
**[Trump's second term.]{.underline}** Trump's reaction to the recently
concluded Supreme Court case about ownership of the social media giant
**[TikTok has been particularly telling]{.underline}** on this point.

The suit by TikTok challenged a law enacted last year that banned the
app from operating in the U.S. unless its Chinese owner, ByteDance, sold
it to a non-Chinese buyer within 270 days. Lawmakers have said the
policy is necessary because China is a "foreign adversary," and due to
(classified) national-security concerns stemming from TikTok's routine
collection of Americans' personal data, including from government
workers and officials.

**[The companies]{.underline}** ultimately **[lost the
case]{.underline}**, and the Supreme Court issued a January 17 ruling
upholding the law---which meant that as of the January 19 deadline, it
became illegal for TikTok to continue operations, and illegal for other
companies to work with them.

**[Yet]{.underline}**, as things stand, **[[Trump]{.mark}
has]{.underline}** effectively **[[instructed a private company to break
federal laws]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[and]{.underline}** to **[violate
a fresh-off-the-press Supreme Court order]{.underline}**. "It's
basically saying, there is a law that has passed that I don't think
should be a law, and therefore my enforcers will not enforce it," said
Zephyr Teachout, a law professor at Fordham University and a former
antitrust enforcer at the New York attorney general's office, on a
recent episode of the Organized Money podcast.

Trump and the company telegraphed their intentions quite openly and
plainly, in worldwide press releases. And, as of today, the president
and his collaborators have carried out their plans, flouting Congress's
law and the Supreme Court's order daily, in the most public manner
possible, and apparently with total impunity.

Perhaps just as important, no one is even raising questions about what
it means for the president to summarily overrule the justices, or
whether the Court can or should have an opportunity to react. With other
challenges to Trump actions sure to move through the court system, it's
an ominous sign for the Court's legitimacy and its practical powers,
even before you get to other questions about our traditional "separation
of powers."

THE FIRST COUPLE WEEKS OF TRUMP'S second presidency have been
characterized by a series of unprecedented exercises of power, and an
equally extraordinary attempt to arrogate even more powers to the
office---and in the individual executive himself---not seen during any
other administration in recent memory.

**[[The admin]{.mark}istration [has tried to freeze]{.mark} trillions in
[government grant money]{.mark}; [fired]{.mark} and suspended hundreds
of government [workers]{.mark}]{.underline}**, while **[trying to
terminate as many as 200,000]{.underline}** in total;
**[[pardoned]{.mark} [supporters]{.mark} who were convicted of
conspiring against the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
and attacking the seat of government; **[[rolled]{.mark}
[back]{.mark}]{.underline}** long-standing **[[civil rights]{.mark}
protections]{.underline}**; and sought to change the Constitution's
post--Civil War citizenship amendment in order to enable mass
deportations.

And **[the White House has undertaken these massive policy
changes]{.underline}** largely **[unilaterally]{.underline}**, by
executive order. **[Trump]{.underline}** himself has candidly
**[admitted]{.underline}** that some of **[the moves appear
unconstitutional]{.underline}**, that the administration fully expects
lawsuits, and that their arguments will hopefully fall on kind ears at
the Court.

Here's how Trump responded last Monday when reporters asked about
whether the birthright citizenship order is unconstitutional (as a
federal judge held shortly afterward), for example:

"Could be. I think we have good grounds, but you could be right," Trump
said, according to a report by The Washington Post. "We'll find out ...
People have wanted to do this for decades."

No one is even raising questions about what it means for the president
to summarily overrule the justices.

Many of the major policy changes are expected to end up before the
justices. Courts have already blocked some of the central policies,
including a conservative-appointed judge who remarked that the
citizenship order was perhaps the most "blatantly unconstitutional"
executive action he'd reviewed in more than four decades. The order to
freeze federal spending was issued Monday night, challenged in federal
court on Tuesday morning, blocked by the judge that afternoon, and was
rescinded by the administration less than 24 hours later.

Meanwhile, administration officials have continued arguing that Trump
has a mandate to implement whatever policies he sees fit, pointing to
the simple fact that he won the election.

The president's attorneys neatly summed up his stance upon taking office
in a legal brief to the justices in the TikTok case, describing Trump in
very intentional, highly unusual terms, as "the incoming embodiment of
the Executive Branch."

Although that case has concluded, the truly **[remarkable
developments]{.underline}** since then **[indicate that [the Supreme
Court's]{.mark} [legitimacy]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the eyes of the
public---and many public officials---**[[will]{.underline}]{.mark}**
likely **[[continue to plummet]{.mark}, and [the Court will be assailed,
from all sides]{.mark}, over the next four years.]{.underline}**

### No Authoritarianism !---1NC

President Donald Trump's critics often accuse him of harboring
authoritarian ambitions. Journalists and scholars have drawn parallels
between his leadership style and that of strongmen abroad. Some
Democrats warn that the U.S. is sliding toward autocracy -- a system in
which one leader holds unchecked power. Others counter that labeling
Trump an autocrat is alarmist. After all, he hasn't suspended the
Constitution, forced school children to memorize his sayings or executed
his rivals, as dictators such as Augusto Pinochet, Mao Zedong and Saddam
Hussein once did. But **[[modern autocrats don't]{.mark} always

[predecessors]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Instead,
**[[they]{.underline}]{.mark}** project a polished image, [**[avoid
overt violence and speak the language of
democracy]{.underline}**.]{.mark} They wear suits, hold elections and
talk about the will of the people. Rather than terrorizing citizens,
many use media control and messaging to shape public opinion and promote
nationalist narratives. Many gain power not through military coups but
at the ballot box. In the early 2000s, political scientist Andreas
Schedler coined the term "electoral authoritarianism" to describe
regimes that hold elections without real competition. Scholars Steven
Levitsky and Lucan Way use another phrase, "competitive
authoritarianism," for systems in which opposition parties exist but
leaders undermine them through censorship, electoral fraud or legal
manipulation. In my own work with economist Sergei Guriev, we explore a
broader strategy that modern autocrats use to gain and maintain power.
We call this "informational autocracy" or "**[spin
dictatorship."]{.underline}** These leaders **[don't rely on violent
repression]{.underline}**. Instead, they craft the illusion that they
are competent, democratic defenders of the nation -- protecting it from
foreign threats or internal enemies who seek to undermine its culture or
steal its wealth. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor **[Orbán exemplifies
this approach.]{.underline}** He first served from 1998 to 2002,
returned to power in 2010 and has since won three more elections -- in
2014, 2018 and 2022 -- after campaigns that international observers
criticized as "intimidating and xenophobic."
**[[Orbán]{.underline}]{.mark}** has **[[preserved the formal structures
of democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- courts, a parliament and regular
elections -- **[but]{.underline}** has **[systematically hollowed them
out]{.underline}**. In his first two years he packed Hungary's
constitutional court, which reviews laws for constitutionality, with
loyalists, forced judges off the bench by mandating a lower retirement
age and rewrote the constitution to limit judicial review of his
actions. He also tightened government control over independent media. To
boost his image, Orbán funneled state advertising funds to friendly news
outlets. In 2016, an ally bought Hungary's largest opposition newspaper
-- then shut it down. Orbán has also targeted advocacy groups and
universities. The Central European University, which was registered in
both Budapest and the U.S., was once a symbol of the new democratic
Hungary. But a law penalizing foreign-accredited institutions forced it
to relocate to Vienna in 2020. Yet **[Orbán has mostly avoided
violence]{.underline}**. Journalists are harassed rather than jailed or
killed. Critics are discredited for their beliefs but not abducted. His
appeal rests on a narrative that Hungary is under siege -- by
immigrants, liberal elites and foreign influences -- and that only he
can defend its sovereignty and Christian identity. That message
resonates with older, rural, conservative voters, even as it alienates
younger, urban populations. In recent decades**[, [variants of spin
dictatorship have]{.mark}]{.underline}** appeared in Singapore,
Malaysia, Kazakhstan, Russia, Ecuador and Venezuela. Leaders such as
Hugo Chávez and the early Vladimir Putin **[[consolidated power and
marginalized opposition with minimal violence. Data confirm this
trend]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Drawing from human rights reports,
historical records and local media, my colleague Sergei Guriev and I
found that **[[the global incidence of political killings and
imprisonments]{.mark} by autocrats [dropped significantly]{.mark} from
the 1980s to the 2010s]{.underline}**. Why? **[In an interconnected
world, overt repression has costs.]{.underline}** **[[Attacking
journalists]{.mark} and dissidents [can prompt]{.mark} foreign
governments to impose economic [sanctions]{.mark} [and
discourage]{.mark} international companies from
[investing]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Curbing free expression risks
stifling scientific and technological innovation -- something even
autocrats need in modern, knowledge-based economies]{.underline}**.
Still, when crises erupt, even spin dictators often revert to more
traditional tactics. Russia's Putin has cracked down violently on
protesters and jailed opposition leaders. Meanwhile, more brutal regimes
such as those in North Korea and China continue to rule by spreading
fear, combining mass incarceration with advanced surveillance
technologies. But **[overall]{.underline}**, **[[spin is replacing
terror]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

### No Authoritarianism !---2NC 

#### Autocracies aren't more war prone

peace,"

In international relations scholarship, a widely-known theory is called
the democratic peace theory. The democratic peace theory in
international relations suggests that democracies are less likely to go
to war with each other. This theory asserts that because democracies are
characterized by a commitment to individual rights and a system of
checks and balances, they are less likely to behave aggressively toward
other democracies. The theory argues that democratic countries share
common values, norms, and institutions and are more likely to resolve
disputes through peaceful means such as negotiation, mediation, or
arbitration. Additionally, democratic leaders are said to be more
accountable to their citizens, who are more likely to resist war and
support diplomatic solutions to conflicts. There is also a lesser-known
theory called the autocratic peace theory. The **[autocratic peace
theory]{.underline}** in international relations **[proposes
that]{.underline}** autocratic regimes or **[[authoritarian governments
are less likely to engage in war with each other]{.mark} compared to
democracies]{.underline}**. **[This theory suggests that [authoritarian
leaders are more interested in maintaining power and stability]{.mark}
within their countries [rather than expanding their influence]{.mark}
through military aggression]{.underline}**. The autocratic peace theory
argues that **[[autocracies are more capable of controlling]{.mark}
their [societies]{.mark} and suppressing internal dissent, [which
reduces]{.mark} the [likelihood of]{.mark} internal [conflict]{.mark}
and makes it easier to avoid external conflict]{.underline}**.
Additionally, **[[autocratic]{.mark} [leaders]{.mark} are said to have
less accountability to their citizens, which allows them to
[make]{.mark} unpopular [decisions]{.mark}, such [as pursuing diplomacy
instead of war]{.mark}, without fear of losing power]{.underline}**. The
expansion of NATO and the EU to Ukraine that triggered the Russian
invasion is ingrained with the notion of democratic peace. The argument
goes, if we bring democracies to the countries around the world, then we
will not have to go to war with them. Hence, we should prop up
democracies and support democratic governments. The evidence for the
democratic peace theory is strong. For example, we can see that
democracies in the Global North (North America, Europe, Japan, South
Korea, New Zealand, and Australia) are significantly less likely to go
to war with one another. On the other hand, autocratic regimes go to war
with one another but less often. The Sino-Soviet border conflict of 1969
is one example; another example is the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s.
Nevertheless, **[autocratic regimes do seem to develop more amicable
relationships than authoritarian and democratic regimes]{.underline}**.
**[In recent years]{.underline}**, especially after the Russian invasion
of Ukraine, **[[the glue in the relationship among autocracies has
significantly increased]{.mark}.]{.underline}** China is getting more
cheap oil and gas from Russia, and Russia receives "non-lethal
assistance" from China. Iran is selling military drones to Russia. But
the pivoting in the relationship between China and Saudi Arabia is more
noteworthy. Traditionally, Saudi Arabia was seen as a puppet of the US
in its foreign policy, which seems to be changing. Saudi Arabia
eliminated the dollar from its oil trade with China as a means of
exchange and replaced it with Yuan. The Iraqi cabinet voted for the
same, replacing the dollar with the yuan. Another shift is China playing
the mediator role between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Seven years ago, they
severed their diplomatic ties and decided to restore them due to an
agreement brokered by the Chinese among them recently. **[The upcoming
autocratic peace is a byproduct of the return of China to the club of
great world powers.]{.underline}** **[[A world with China as the leading
power is attractive for all autocratic regimes
worldwide]{.underline}]{.mark}**. China would not question human rights
violations, dealing with marginalized ethnic groups, gender disparity,
etc., in countries with authoritarian regimes --- treating them as
internal matters. The problem with the US-dominated world for autocrats
is that it sometimes uses human rights violations, women's oppression,
and the rights of minority groups to pressure its adversaries. For
instance, The US points out Iran's human rights violations more often
than when it is committed by Saudi Arabia, which is worse. The US not
only ignores what Saudi Arabia is doing in Yemen, but it also helps it.
In contrast, China does not support one autocrat against another; its
stance is more like, "Hey guys, work out your differences so that it
does not disrupt trade."

#### The premise of the impact is false -- democracies are not inherently more peaceful than autocracies

House of Lords and Professor Emeritus of Political Economy at Warwick
University\], International Politics and Society (Journal), "The false
promise of democratic peace,"

Through persuasion, exhortation, legal processes, economic pressure, and
sometimes military force, American foreign policy asserts the United
States' view about how the world should be run. Only two countries in
recent history have had such world-transforming ambitions: Britain and
the US. In the last 150 years, these are the only two countries whose
power -- hard and soft, formal and informal -- has extended to all parts
of the world, allowing them plausibly to aspire to the mantle of Rome.
When the US inherited Britain's global position after 1945, it also
inherited Britain's sense of responsibility for the future of the
international order. Embracing that role, America has been an evangelist
of democracy, and a central US foreign-policy objective since the fall
of communism has been to promote its spread -- sometimes by regime
change, when that is deemed necessary. In fact, this playbook dates back
to US President Woodrow Wilson's time. As historian Nicholas Mulder
writes in The Economic Weapon: The Rise of Sanctions as a Tool of Modern
War, 'Wilson was the first statesman to cast the economic weapon as an
instrument of democratization. He thereby added an internal political
rationale for economic sanctions -- spreading democracy -- to the
external political goal that...European advocates of sanctions have
aimed at: inter-state peace.' The implication is that, where the
opportunity offers, military and non-military measures should be used to
topple 'malign' regimes. **[According to [democratic peace
theory]{.mark}, democracies do not start wars; only dictatorships
do.]{.underline}** A wholly democratic world thus would be a world
without war. This was the hope that emerged in the 1990s. With the end
of communism, the expectation, famously expressed by Francis Fukuyama's
1989 article, 'The End of History?,' was that the most important parts
of the world would become democratic. US supremacy was supposed to
ensure that democracy became the universal political norm. But Russia
and China, the leading communist states of the Cold War era, have not
embraced it; nor have many other centres of world affairs, especially in
the Middle East. Hence, Fukuyama has recently acknowledged that if
Russia and China were driven together, 'then you would really be living
in a world that was being dominated by these non-democratic
powers...\[which\] really is the end of the end of history.' The
argument that democracy is inherently 'peaceful,' and dictatorship or
autocracy 'warlike,' is intuitively attractive. It does not deny that
states pursue their own interests; but it assumes that the interests of
democratic states will reflect common values like human rights, and that
those interests will be pursued in a less bellicose manner (since
democratic processes require negotiation of differences). Democratic
governments are accountable to their people, and the people have an
interest in peace, not war. By contrast, according to this view, rulers
and elites in dictatorships are illegitimate and therefore insecure,
which leads them to seek popular support by whipping up animosity toward
foreigners. If democracy replaced dictatorship everywhere, world peace
would follow automatically. **[This belief rests on two
propositions]{.underline}** **[that]{.underline}** have been extremely
influential in international relations theory, even though they **[[are
poorly grounded theoretically and empirically]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
**[The first is [the notion that a state's external behaviour is
determined by its domestic constitution]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- **[a
view that [ignores the influence the international system can
have]{.mark} on a country's domestic politics]{.underline}**. As the
American political scientist Kenneth N. Waltz argued in his 1979 book,
The Theory of International Politics, 'international anarchy' conditions
the behaviour of states more than the behaviour of states creates
international anarchy. Waltz's 'world-systems theory' perspective is
particularly useful in an age of globalisation. **[[One must look to the
structure of the international system]{.mark} to 'predict' how
individual states will behave]{.underline}**, regardless of their
domestic constitutions. 'If each state, being stable, strove only for
security, and had no designs on its neighbours, all states would
nevertheless remain insecure,' he observed, 'for the means of security
for one state are, in their very existence, the means by which other
states are threatened.' Waltz offered a bracing antidote to the facile
assumption that democratic habits are easily transferable from one
location to another. Rather than trying to spread democracy, he
suggested that it would be better to try to reduce global insecurity.
**[[Though there is]{.underline}]{.mark}** undeniably [**[some
correlation]{.underline}** **[between democratic institutions and
peaceful habits]{.underline}**, **[the direction of causation is
disputable]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}** Was it democracy
that made Europe peaceful after 1945? Or did the US nuclear umbrella,
the fixing of borders by the victors, and Marshall Plan-fuelled economic
growth finally make it possible for non-communist Europe to accept
democracy as its political norm? The political scientist Mark E.
Pietrzyk contends that, '**[[Only states which are relatively
secure]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- politically, militarily, economically
**[-- [can afford to have free]{.mark}, pluralistic [societies]{.mark};
in the absence of this security, states are much more]{.underline}**
likely **[to adopt]{.underline}**, maintain, or revert to centralised,
**[coercive]{.underline}** authority **[structures]{.underline}**.'
**[[The second proposition is that democracy is the natural form of the
state]{.mark},]{.underline}** which people everywhere will spontaneously
adopt if allowed to. **[[This dubious assumption]{.underline}]{.mark}**
makes regime change seem easy, because the sanctioning powers can rely
on the welcoming support of those whose freedom has been repressed and
whose rights have been trampled underfoot. By drawing superficial
comparisons with post-war Germany and Japan, the apostles of
democratisation **[[grossly underestimate the difficulties of installing
democracies in societies that lack Western constitutional
traditions]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The results of their handiwork can be
seen in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, and many African countries.
**[Democratic peace theory is, above all, lazy]{.underline}**. **[It
provides an easy explanation for 'warlike' behaviour without considering
the location and history of the states involved]{.underline}**. This
shallowness lends itself to overconfidence that a quick dose of economic
sanctions or bombing is all that is needed to cure a dictatorship of its
unfortunate affliction. In short, the idea that democracy is 'portable'
leads to a gross underestimation of the military, economic, and
humanitarian costs of trying to spread democracy to troubled parts of
the world. The West has paid a terrible price for such thinking -- and
it may be about to pay again.
