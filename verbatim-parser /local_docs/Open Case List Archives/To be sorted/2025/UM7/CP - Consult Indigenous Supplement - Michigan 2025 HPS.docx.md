## Solvency

### 2NC\-\--Solvency\-\--Developement

#### Indigenous Consultation is essential for sustainable Arctic development.

**Sjöberg et al. 18** (Department of Physical Geography, Stockholm
University, 10691 Stockholm, Sweden ("Involvement of local Indigenous
peoples in Arctic research --- expectations, needs and challenges
perceived by early career researchers", 5 December 2018,
https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/as-2017-0045)

The survey respondents were split equally (50%/50%) among ECRs that had
interacted with Indigenous populations for their research and those who
had not. [Most of the respondents agreed strongly or very strongly that
the involvement of local Indigenous peoples could be beneficial for
their research and that the involvement of local Indigenous peoples in
research was essential for the sustainable development of the Arctic
region. The knowledge and experience of local Indigenous peoples were
also perceived as an untapped resource for Arctic research.]{.underline}
ECRs perceived local Indigenous peoples' [understanding of the local
environment, history, culture, and customs of their study areas as
better than their own (]{.underline}Fig. 2). However, ECRs perceived
their own understanding of western research methods as better than that
of local Indigenous peoples and perceived the understanding of logistics
and field safety as similar for the two groups. [When asked about their
expectations for involving local Indigenous peoples in research,
respondents highlighted (i) the sharing of knowledge, (ii) gaining a
better understanding of the local environment, (iii) history and
culture, and (iv) finding ways to identify relevant research questions
as the most important (see sample quotes in Fig. 2b). Several
respondents emphasized that they expected the involvement of Indigenous
peoples to require patience (see quotes in Appendix C, question 22), and
many highlighted that they expect a sharing of knowledge, as illustrated
in Fig. 3]{.underline}. Entering into these collaborations, several ECRs
did not indicate any prevailing prior expectations, but rather that they
had hopes for generally positive outcomes (Appendix C, question 22).
[When asked how the involvement of local Indigenous peoples benefits
their research, a majority said that it provided a better understanding
of the local environment and history and that it increased the outreach
of the research. Around 40% of the respondents also indicated that it
provided better field safety and helped avoid conflicts with local
people]{.underline}. Among the respondents, [79% expressed that they
would like to have more involvement of local Indigenous peoples in their
research]{.underline}. This was true for involvement in field work (59%
of respondents), outreach activities (54%), and research design (48%).
Financial resources ranked highest as a need for increasing the
involvement of Indigenous peoples (58%), as well as more contacts and
networking opportunities (52%), and more time (41%). 

### 2NC\-\--Solvency\-\--Tourism

#### Logistics and tourism harms indigenous communities unless governed by binding benefit sharing frameworks with indigenous rights and participation

Fomina**, Svitlana**, **01**-, legal scholar focused on Arctic
governance and indigenous rights \"Lokaverkefni: \"Legal mechanisms for
sharing the benefits of cruise tourism with indigenous peoples in the
Canadian Arctic and Greenland\"\", No Publication,
https://skemman.is/handle/1946/51257/HH\
The rapid expansion **[of [Arctic cruise tourism]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
driven by better access to remote regions **[[due to climate change and
the allure of \"last chance\" tourism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, has
intensified cruise activity along the Northwest Passage, **[[raising
concerns about its impacts on Indigenous communities in Canada and
Greenland. While benefit sharing is a well-established concept in the
extractive sector]{.underline}]{.mark}**, its application in cruise
tourism remains limited due to the industry's transient and
non-extractive nature. This research examines existing international
instruments and domestic legal and non-legal mechanisms, as well as
[**the [perspectives of Indigenous]{.mark}**
[**communities**]{.mark}]{.underline}, to **[[assess how benefit sharing
is conceptualised and implemented in the Canadian Arctic and
Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It also applies the concept of Social
License to Operate (SLO) to evaluate how communities' perspectives on
cruise tourism development influence the governance of this industry and
practices exercised by cruise operators. Findings reveal that in [**[the
Canadian Arctic, benefit-sharing frameworks are grounded in treaty
rights and government programs but lack cruise-specific
regulation]{.underline}**.]{.mark} In contrast, **[[Greenland has begun
to integrate community concerns into legislation, aiming to enhance
local ownership]{.underline}]{.mark}** and control over the revenues
generated by the industry. However**[, [both regions face gaps in
enforcement, capacity, and formal mechanisms to hold cruise operators
accountable. Indigenous communities increasingly make efforts to guide
cruise tourism through management plans]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
semi-formal partnerships, yet these rely more on goodwill than binding
commitments. The Association of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators
(AECO) plays a key role in facilitating dialogue between Indigenous
communities and cruise operators, promoting community engagement and
best practices among its members. This thesis argues that cruise tourism
**[in the Arctic requires legal frameworks tailored to the sector,
grounded in Indigenous Peoples']{.underline}** rights and SLO
principles. **[[Strengthening Indigenous participation and formalised
partnerships are essential to ensure benefit sharing that supports
sustainable development of the industry and advances Indigenous
empowerment.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

### 2NC\-\--Solvency Framing\-\--Climate Change

### 2NC\-\--Solvency\-\--Research

#### Co-producing knowledge with Arctic Indigenous communities ensures usable research but requires addressing power imbalances and cultural tensions.

**Arnott,** J. C., 4-16-20**25**, Researcher focused on Arctic
indigenous collaborations \"Factors in and Perspectives of Achieving
Co‐Production of Knowledge With Arctic Indigenous Peoples\", Wiley
Online Library,
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023CSJ000074/ HH

The **[[process of co-production of knowledge (CPK) has the potential to
achieve benefits of usable, actionable research outcomes, including
direct benefits]{.mark} to [communities]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Figus et
al., **2024**). CPK requires a diverse team of researchers and community
partners. It is especially important to include those intended to
benefit from the project. **[[CPK is centered around collaboration and
requires shared decision-making at every step of
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** research **[[process]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(Djenontin & Meadow, **2018**; Mach et al., **2020**; National Science
Foundation, **2021**; Norström et al., **2020**; Wall et al., **2017**;
Yua et al., **2022**). However, tensions can arise as a result of
cultural or methodological differences, including between different
disciplines. Inherent limitations of time and project resources can
compound these tensions. For example, **[[every project is
constrained]{.mark} not only [in the amount of funding available, but
also by timeline and requirements for funding, the capacity of the
research team, and the existence or lack of established relationships
among team members]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The dynamics and imbalances
of power and politics within CPK projects need to be addressed (Daly &
Dilling, **2019**; Lemos et al., **2018**), including those between
researchers and community members, as well as those among different
disciplines. As a result of the U.S. National Science Foundation\'s
Navigating the New Arctic (NSF; NNA) funding program (National Science
Foundation, **2019**), **[[CPK has become an increasingly
popular]{.mark} approach [for]{.mark} researchers [working with Arctic
Indigenous communities. Best practices and ethics for Indigenous
engagement, as well as Indigenous methodologies, are essential aspects
of making CPK projects culturally inclusive.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The
goal of this article is to provide tools for understanding the CPK
approach in a cross-cultural context, in **[[particular with Arctic
Indigenous communities]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The target audience for
this article are researchers, including natural and physical scientists
that may lack understanding of key social science terms and concepts.
Within any research project, each researcher and research partner
consciously or unconsciously prioritizes different aspects of the
research process depending on their perspective (Section **4.1**).
Throughout this article, we call these different project priorities
"Factors of Success." These **[Factors of Success are rooted in the
personal and professional backgrounds]{.underline}** of CPK team
members, creating multifaceted perspectives within a project.
Multifaceted perspectives are also rooted in cultural and trained
perceptions of credibility, relevance, and legitimacy (Section **4.2**).

### 2NC\-\--Solvency\-\--Green Tech

#### Consultation is key to avoid green colonialism.

\[https://www.lyellcollection.org/doi/full/10.3389/esss.2024.10117\]

The united global goal, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to
transition to greener energy forms, directly impacts Indigenous
communities in the Arctic. Currently, the Just Green Transition is
dependent upon mineral extraction, extraction that often takes place on
Indigenous land in the name of the "Green New Deal" (Robbins and
Zografos, 2020). This has been termed **[["Green
Colonialism,"]{.underline}]{.mark} the phrase was first used by Aili
Keskitalo, the former president of the Sámi Parliament in Norway, to
[[describe]{.mark} the [impact of extractive industries and energy
development projects on Indigenous land]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Normann,
2022, pg. 13; Saami-Council, 2017). Whilst there are undoubtedly
detrimental consequences of mining in the Arctic, with [many of these
impacts]{.underline} being [deemed acts of "Green
Colonialism"]{.underline} it is remiss to not acknowledge the
multifaceted benefits of this resource extraction. Whether or not
impacts are positive or negative can vary depending on the scale or
perspective of the problem. We therefore present specific examples from
different regions of the Arctic below.

[Throughout the Arctic,]{.underline} [[Indigenous]{.mark} and local
[communities have had]{.mark} their [right]{.mark} to
[s]{.mark}elf-determination continually [thwarted]{.mark}]{.underline}
and challenged [[by]{.underline}]{.mark} a myriad of
[[industries]{.underline}]{.mark} and developmental projects [in the
region]{.underline}. The [**[sentiment behind "Green Colonialism," the
purposeful sacrificing of Indigenous land in the name of environmental
goals]{.mark}**, has [led to]{.mark}]{.underline} the creation of
[[domestic and international]{.mark} [agreements
with]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[aim of]{.mark}]{.underline} protecting
and [[preserving Indigenous land, culture and
identity.]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[Development of land claim

settlement in US history, have [[positively contribute]{.mark}d
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} Impact and Benefit [[Agreements between
Indigenous peoples and mines]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in Alaska and
elsewhere.]{.underline}

Whilst the mining sector is an industry known to have a direct impact on
Indigenous communities in the Arctic, the [[impacts]{.underline}]{.mark}
of development [in the Arctic [come from]{.mark}]{.underline} a wider
array of [[industries]{.underline}]{.mark} including but not limited to
[[resource extraction, exploitation of]{.mark}]{.underline} other
[natural [resources]{.mark} (hunting, fishing), tourism, transport and
energy infrastructure.]{.underline} These impacts have [[led
to]{.underline}]{.mark} the development of a variety of [frameworks and

Introduction

[[Current]{.mark} global ecological, political and social [crises demand
new approaches to **environmental governance and
management**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Cross-cultural knowledge sharing in
natural resource management has, in varied forms, been around for some
decades, however, is receiving growing academic
attention.^1^[ ]{.underline}More and more [calls for the convergence of
different ways of knowing in planning and environmental decision-making
processes can be heard.]{.underline}^2^[ The areas of highest
biodiversity on the planet are under [Indigenous]{.mark} stewardship, a
fact that attests to the historical efficacy of the [environmental
knowledge and **sustainable management regimes**]{.mark} of Indigenous
peoples in those areas.]{.underline}^3^[ This has also been a driver of
a concerted focus on the integration of Indigenous knowledges and
practices into environmental governance and management
regimes.]{.underline}^4^

In 2018 a group of scholars, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, were awarded
a Norwegian Research Council Grant, *The Integration of Indigenous
Knowledge Systems into Mapping, Planning and Environmental Decision
Making: The Role of Community-Based Impact Assessments as a Strategic
Planning Tool* (INDKNOW).^5^ Via a series of international case studies,
we explored various approaches to the inclusion of Indigenous knowledges
in differing land use decision-making processes, including the
epistemological, practical and political impediments to effective
inclusion, and how these might be addressed. The two focus areas of our
project were Aboriginal knowledges in Australia, and the inclusion and
implementation of Sámi reindeer herding knowledges in state-led
governance and decision-making in Norway and Sweden.

This paper synthesises and reflects on the findings from these and
related case studies within this thematic series at the *Arctic Review
on Law and Politics*, and their contribution to the literature on the
practical challenges associated with incorporation of Indigenous
knowledges, but can also stand on its own as a conversation between
different scholars in the field.^6^ As noted, our focus is on the
"knowledge-implementation gap"^7^ in conservation science, which also
characterizes the lack of inclusion of Aboriginal and Sámi knowledges in
state land use governance with selected examples from the two
territories. To address this gap, Indigenous peoples need to be
empowered through recognition of land ownership and rights, and the
value of Indigenous knowledge systems.^8^ To what extent is knowledge
inclusion facilitated through legal recognition of rights and
recognition of the value of Indigenous knowledge systems by the
authorities in Norway, Sweden and Australia? Our work is not a full
comparison of Indigenous-state relations in Australia, Sweden and
Norway; rather a juxtaposition of partial pieces of these relations
which enable us to place related cases in different jurisdictions side
by side for the purpose of gaining insights from their
differences.^9^ Although the chosen cases take place in different
geographies and governance systems, they are united by common challenges
or lack of recognition and implementation of Indigenous knowledges in
land use governance and decision-making. In our work, there is only one
case from Australia, while four of the cases are from a diversity of
locations in Sámi reindeer herding areas in Norway and Sweden. Thus, our
main focus is on the diversity of challenges in Sápmi, which has
benefitted from a juxtaposition with the differences in the recognition
of, and working with Aboriginal communities in Australia. While a
comparison often involves an evaluative aspect and ranking and is based
on prior assumptions of similarities and differences,^10^ a
juxtaposition can bring forth concepts and insights that are not obvious
beforehand.^11^ By juxtaposing cases in Australia and Sápmi, we offer
insights from research projects that have analysed and brought together
different approaches to the inclusion of diverse knowledge systems, or
lack thereof, in land use governance and decision-making. To do so, we
outline some international and national political and policy impetuses
for the legal and state recognition and inclusion of Indigenous
knowledges in state-led land use governance, and discuss some central
challenges to inclusion, before conceptualising Indigenous knowledges,
and finally introducing the ensuing individual INDKNOW studies.

2 Governance

Numerous global and national policy imperatives motivate the inclusion
of Indigenous knowledges and values into planning and decision-making
involving their lands and waters. These are reflected in various
statutory, policy and judicial guidelines and reports, and in
multilateral environmental treaties and soft-law documents. For
instance, the Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) identifies Indigenous and traditional knowledges
as "major resource\[s\] for adapting to climate change".^12^ Similarly,
the intergovernmental expert body IPBES (Intergovernmental
Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services) aims "to
promote effective engagement with Indigenous and local knowledge holders
in all relevant aspects of its work".^13^ This notion is reflected in
Agenda 21 (Section 6) and the 2007 United Nations Declaration on the
Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).^14^ Respecting and including
Indigenous peoples' rights and knowledges are main considerations for
the implementation of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity
Framework,^15^ "including through their full and effective participation
in decision-making, in accordance with relevant national legislation,
international instruments..." including UNDRIP and human rights law.

The Arctic Council, a prominent intergovernmental forum, ostensibly
provides for active participation in decision-making processes for
Indigenous peoples residing in the Arctic territories.^16^ [[The Arctic
Council]{.mark} recently [emphasised the importance of]{.mark}
encouraging the utilization of [Indigenous knowledge]{.mark}s
[in]{.mark} the [planning and conduct of scientific activities]{.mark},
via the Agreement on Enhanced International Arctic Scientific
Cooperation. [The EU]{.mark}s Arctic Strategy [also recognises the
importance of Indigenous knowledges]{.mark}]{.underline}, stating that
"The EU will invest in Arctic research under Horizon Europe, including
cooperation with indigenous knowledge holders".^17^

[In Sápmi, [the need to consider Indigenous]{.mark} and traditional
[knowledge]{.mark}s [in planning, resource and land management
is]{.mark} also well [recognized]{.mark}]{.underline}.^18^ The
Sámediggis^19^ in all three Nordic countries have published statements
to this end, calling for respectful engagement and use of Sámi and
traditional knowledges. Some recognition now exists in national
legislation. For example, the *Norwegian Biodiversity Act* states that
authorities must premise their decisions on both science and knowledge
"based on many generations of experience acquired through the use of and
interaction with the natural environment, including traditional Saami
use".^20^ This national legislation corresponds to Article 8 in the UN
Convention on Biological Diversity, as does the *Norwegian Planning and
Building Act (*2008) via the related provision on Impact
Assessments.^21^ The *Norwegian Reindeer Herding Act* (2007) stipulates
that the rules for grazing must be based on Sámi traditions and
customary use. However, the work of Turi and Eira on the use of
traditional knowledge, shows that Norwegian management has only to a
small extent included Sámi traditional knowledge in the knowledge base
of land and environmental governance.^22^ In Sweden, the situation is
similar. While traditional knowledge is formally recognised mainly in
relation to biodiversity, implemented through the so-called Swedish
environmental targets, a recent overview identifies many shortcomings
and practical obstacles standing in the way for actual inclusion and
recognition of traditional knowledge, including legislative barriers and
inconsistencies.^23^ Another example is the recent Sámi Consultation
Law^24^ which demands public consultations with the Sámi people on
matters that concern them. The act, however, only mentions traditional
knowledge in passing and due to its narrow construction, many burning
land use issues are left outside of the consultation
requirement.^25^ [Hence, [while **symbolic recognition** exists, genuine
recognition and supportive institutional conditions]{.mark} for
including Sámi traditional knowledge in practical land use governance
and permit processes is [still missing]{.mark}.]{.underline}^26^

Sámi traditional practices are however seeing growing legal recognition
as a result of high-profile court cases, including recent Supreme Court
rulings in all Nordic countries.^27^ In the 2021 Fosen case, the
Norwegian Supreme Court stated that remedial measures such as fencing,
in place of traditional herding methods, would be a violation of Sámi
culture and a substantive negative impact on the Sámi reindeer herders'
right to enjoy their culture; it would amount to a violation of Article
27 of the ICCPR. Yet, despite these moves toward greater recognition of
Sámi rights and the value of Indigenous traditional practices to
sustainable land use governance,^28^ there is a lack of concrete
implementation in the form of institutional mechanisms and practices in
the Nordic states' land use governance systems.

In Australia, the impetus to include Aboriginal knowledges into land and
marine based decision-making processes was driven, in part, by the
development of both State and Territory based Land Rights legislative
regimes and Commonwealth recognition of native title. In 1992, the High
Court of Australia handed down the historic Mabo decision which created
an opportunity for the Anglo-Australian legal system to recognise
interests in land that had existed prior to colonisation -- native
title. The judgment determined that where claimants can show that they
have an ongoing connection with land according to their 'traditional'
laws, and their interest has not been extinguished, then the court may
declare that their interest be recognised. Following the Mabo decision,
and amidst heated public debate, the Keating Labor government enacted
the *Native Title Act* 1993 (Cth) (NTA).^29^ In New South Wales,
the *Aboriginal Land Rights Act, 1983* (ALRA) provides land rights for
Aboriginal people. The principle of self-determination underpins
the ALRA. Land is vested in representative land councils that work to
deliver tangible economic, social and cultural benefits to Aboriginal
communities in NSW, specifically economic independence as well as
providing compensation for past injustice.^30^ These legislative regimes
frame individual land use policy settings embedded within whichever
legislative framework governs the decision-making process in question.

[Any attempts [to include Indigenous knowledges in
decision-making]{.mark}, therefore, [must]{.mark} acknowledge and
[accommodate the different governance structures]{.mark} that exist in
each place, and the implications for power asymmetries presented via
these divergent governance realities]{.underline}. For example, while
various land rights and Native Title legislative regimes may afford
Indigenous Australians a say in how their land and waters should be
managed, they do not ensure their voices, knowledges and perspectives
will be incorporated in, let alone steer, the final decision-making
process.^31^ Similarly, in parts of Sápmi, the inclusion of Indigenous
knowledges in impact assessment processes has rarely led to the
rejection of projects with considerable negative impacts on Sámi lands
and livelihoods, with developers and state authorities retaining control
over the critical phases of scoping and determining how impact
significance is assessed.^32^ Some reindeer herders have been critical
of the time spent on impact assessments as they do not see their
knowledge equally valued in the result, which makes it feel like a
cosmetic measure to imply a participatory process. In Sápmi, and
specifically when cross-boundary reindeer herding is concerned, there is
often a multi-level governance situation where both international and
national laws, regulations, and bureaucratic practices need to be
navigated in land-use conflict, and that adds to the cumulative pressure
on reindeer herders.^33^ This can also weaken Indigenous Knowledge
inclusion, as for example, when municipalities do not have the necessary
competence to identify all rights holders or when industry proponents
refuse to assess cumulative impacts and compliance with international
law.^34^

Hence, as we discuss more below, despite the plethora of international
and national imperatives to consult with Indigenous peoples, the
challenge remains of *how* Indigenous knowledges can be included and
implemented in decision-making processes; the actual processes and
procedures, and the methods and methodologies involved in best practice
collaborative decision-making and planning. This can be exacerbated by
strategic marginalisation and ignorance of Indigenous
knowledges,^35^ manifested through structures and interests working
against integration of Indigenous knowledges in planning and
decision-making.^36^ In the next section we provide a conceptual
overview of the notion of Indigenous knowledge, without pretending to
offer anything near an exhaustive review.

3 Conceptualising Indigenous Knowledge

We are aware of the inherent critiques concerned with the documentation
and inclusion of Indigenous knowledge systems into policy and decision-
making. Critical theorists on dialogue and participation,^37^ critical
Indigenous scholars,^38^ planning
theorists,^39^ anthropologists,^40^ political ecologists,^41^ and
Indigenous planners,^42^ have all, in varying ways, critiqued
assumptions underlying ambitions to 'implement' Indigenous knowledges
into environmental decision-making processes. These critiques range from
enunciation of practical barriers to fundamental rejection of the entire
political projects, wherein knowledge integration might be nothing but
an attempt to legitimize continued colonialism and dispossession. We are
also not oblivious to the contestation surrounding definitions of
Indigenous knowledge that have been exhaustively covered in other
works.^43^ Rather than seeking to offer a definitive definition of
Indigenous knowledge, our need is instead for a heuristic
conceptualization to provide a starting point for learning across the
individual studies included within this thematic series.

A useful starting point is Von der Porten, de Loë and
McGregor's^44^ argument that Indigenous knowledges are collectively held
understandings of a particular environment developed by the Indigenous
peoples living on that landscape for thousands of years and passed down
through generations. For example, Indigenous knowledges can draw from
observations and experiences of generations, transmitted either orally,
or via chants and art, and storytelling.^45^ [Indigenous knowledges have
been [characterised as bodies of knowledge that can interpret
the]{.mark} surrounding [environment]{.mark}, often [with]{.mark} a
lengthier track record - or time depth - than scientific
knowledge.]{.underline}^46^

[Common to all Indigenous knowledges is the emphasis on knowledge coming
from a specific place,]{.underline}^47^[ with Indigenous and local
knowledges representing **[valuable ecosystem information]{.mark}**
acquired [over long periods of time]{.mark}.]{.underline}^48^ Given the
diversity of Indigenous experiences and knowledge around the world, Van
der Porten et al.^49^ suggest that context must be respected in all
discussions on Indigenous knowledges. Strong contextual and cultural
connections make Indigenous knowledges an essential part of Indigenous
peoples' lives, as it provides the necessary means for their survival.
Separating Indigenous knowledges from their socio-cultural context
becomes meaningless and dangerous, as it may lead to incorrect
interpretations and misuse of this knowledge.^50^

#### Key indigenous knowledge is not being taking into account due to [power imbalances]{.underline} when it should be implemented.

Decision-Making."

4 Ontological and Epistemological Divide

Yet, [Indigenous peoples' knowledges are generally
treated *unequally* in environmental decision-making. Western scientific
knowledge is often treated as superior, while [Indigenous peoples'
experiences of their environment are marginalised]{.mark} and
disregarded as anecdotal and biased.]{.underline}^65^[ This epistemic
privileging of scientific knowledge over Indigenous knowledge systems in
mainstream processes of environmental decision-making has serious
ramifications for inclusion of Indigenous knowledges, with existing
research demonstrating they are routinely marginalised, [devalued and
even dismissed]{.mark}.]{.underline}^66^ The power of the group
supporting the idea, determines the strength of the idea.^67^ There are
thus both distinct epistemological and power divides that pose
challenges for successful integration of Indigenous knowledges in land
use governance. Fjellheim^68^ documents the difficulties encountered by
Sámi herders in trying to articulate their knowledges to decision-makers
in a context where 'Western' sciences and perceptions of Saami land-use
predominate. Reindeer herding communities increasingly resist and
challenge state and corporate perceptions of what constitutes legitimate
knowledge.^69^ [In Australia, Gratani et al.]{.underline}^70^[ critique
the accepted wisdom that Indigenous knowledges are only accepted as
valid knowledge if they can be verified using Western science; the
[authors argue for an integration of both forms of knowledge while
privileging neither]{.mark}.]{.underline}

There is a sense that planners regard the validation of Indigenous
knowledges by science as crucial,^71^ or, as Jacobson and
Stephens^72^ put it, "\[e\]ven when it is recognized that local
knowledge is insightful, an expectation exists that it must be
contrasted against science for it to be considered true." There still
exists that pervasive sense that Indigenous knowledges cannot be
trusted, or even valued, unless given the stamp of approval by formal
science.^73^ As Law and Joks^74^ discuss, Sámi ways of knowing salmon
are often disqualified on epistemological grounds, since the
experiential and oral nature of Sámi salmon knowledge is read to lack
rigour; it is not regarded as 'science' and therefore not allowed to
count. This lack of critical awareness of the hegemony of scientific
knowledge in planning and environmental decision-making processes is
unfortunately commonplace.^75^ [For participatory approaches to be
successful, different knowledges need to be considered as having the
same validity and value.]{.underline}^76^[ However, the lingering
[ontological and epistemological challenges]{.mark} that [arise]{.mark}
when different ways of knowing are confronted with each other present
significant challenges for those seeking to incorporate Indigenous
knowledges into decision-making processes.]{.underline}^77^

[These **[power imbalances]{.mark}** that confront attempts to
incorporate Indigenous knowledges into environmental decision-making
processes [have been noted]{.mark} previously [by
scholars]{.mark}.]{.underline}^78^ Van der Porten et al.^79^ argue that
acknowledgement of these power imbalances does not go far enough in
actually addressing them. They suggest attempts to include Indigenous
Knowledge systems into environmental and planning decision-making,
without problematising the inherent power imbalances, does not meet
expectations regarding Indigenous knowledge systems and
self-determination advanced by Indigenous scholars.^80^ This oversight
thus poses a significant obstacle to successful integration. This power
asymmetry, and difficulties in the integration of Indigenous knowledge
systems, is further compounded by the potential for knowledge misuse,
appropriation or marginalisation. The reality is that this further
discourages the sharing of Indigenous knowledge systems within
collaborative decision- making processes.^81^ Indigenous people engaging
in these processes operate from a perspective which has at its core,
scepticism, fear and distrust of the motives and potential actions of
the state/Crown and industry proponents.^82^

5 A Diversity of Cases of Indigenous Knowledge Systems

The research on which the following five single case studies were based,
used different methodological approaches, like fuzzy cognitive mapping,
participatory action research, practical argumentation analysis,
qualitative interviews, and policy analysis. The individual articles in
this thematic series will give a more thorough description of the
different approaches in their method sections. All of us aimed to
respect Indigenous research ethics and methodologies, and therefore
different ways of knowledge co-production has taken place in the
different projects. We also shared the standpoint that research
concerning Indigenous realities should be done in a way that aims for
being useful to the concerned communities.

What unites the cases further is the lack of or challenges to
incorporation of Sámi reindeer herders' knowledge and Aboriginal
knowledge in the knowledge basis for environmental governance and
industrial development projects. The lack of inclusion in the Sámi cases
is enforced by the lack of meaningful participation in land-use
governance, where reindeer herders experience a distinct lack of
capacity and resources to keep up with development projects. [As most of
the cases show, [the importance of Sámi reindeer herders' knowledge
is]{.mark} often [not taken into account before the conflicts reach the
court rooms]{.mark} or the protest demonstrations start. This
illustrates the real need to create governance mechanisms and
institutions whose mandates it is to implement the good intentions of
legal acts and the principles emphasized by courts of law.]{.underline}

The study by Horstkotte et al. (this thematic series) engages with
Indigenous knowledge through a co-productive process aiming to map and
explore how Sámi reindeer herders in Northern Sweden navigate the
complexity of decision-making on adaptation, specifically decisions
regarding supplementary feeding in conditions when winter grazing
resources are inaccessible. How to successfully deal with rapidly
changing climate and land use conditions is a key concern for many
herding communities in Sápmi and requires skillful navigating between
multiple, varying and interlinked social-ecological drivers. The authors
hold that engaging with the concept of adaptation demands considerate
reflection on which knowledge(s) and values count, and importantly, who
gets a say in what is considered desirable or not. Together with Sámi
reindeer herders, the authors use fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM) to
understand if, when and why supplementary feeding becomes a needed or
preferred strategy, and when and why it does not. The study demonstrates
that supplementary feeding, considered from the herders' perspective, is
typically positioned toward the least desirable end of an
adaptation-maladaptation continuum. [The increasing use of supplementary
feeding can be explained as a forced response driven by complex system
dynamics transforming both pastoral and decision-making landscapes when
[adaptation strategies should]{.mark} instead [focus on halting the loss
of]{.mark}, and restoring already lost, [grazing
grounds]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The paper by Löf et al. assesses voluntary dialogue-based GIS planning
instruments, specifically Reindeer Husbandry Plans (*Renbruksplan*),
within a Swedish forestry context. Within a highly contested forestry
space, these collaborative environmental governance instruments have
been developed to alleviate land use conflicts between industry and Sámi
reindeer herders. Importantly, this study is not primarily a study of
or *about* Indigenous Sámi knowledge. Instead, it is aimed at
contrasting Sámi and industry views, in making sense of the way the
forest industry seeks to integrate Sámi knowledge in land use planning.
Sámi community colleagues were invited to help guide the inquiry,
including framing the research questions, making empirical
contributions, and interpreting emerging (anonymized) findings, about
the practices of the forest industry on traditional Sámi lands. The
study demonstrates fundamental differences in perspectives between the
forestry industry (an extractive logic) and Sámi ontologies (e.g.
centered on social relations to the land as well as the reindeer's
relation to the land and people). The scholars show how the reindeer
husbandry plans are an arena where these perspectives might be
negotiated, however, are ultimately a site where industry perspectives
easily become privileged over Sámi interests, resulting in greater
potential for land use conflict.

The paper by Broderstad and Gross presents the case of Nasa mountain
- *Násávárre*, a proposed quartz mine impacting five Indigenous Sámi
reindeer herding districts on both the Norwegian and the Swedish side of
Sápmi. Their starting point is the ministerial expectation of a
corporate dialogue between the company Elkem and the impacted reindeer
herding groups. Based on a review of case documents, they discuss how
knowledge is valued, recognized and made within the structures of the
Indigenous-industry dialogue. They conclude that despite stringent
regulations and authorities' expectations that corporate dialogue would
succeed in resolving the case, the structures in place do not
effectively safeguard Indigenous agency and rights when faced with
industrial interests. [Among other challenges, the reindeer [herders
highlight deficiencies in the impact assessment and the inadequate
knowledge base for evaluating mitigation measures]{.mark}, which also
failed to consider the requirements of international law. The permit
process demonstrates **[asymmetrical power relations]{.mark}** between
the Sámi and the Chinese owned mining company Elkem, exacerbating the
ontological and epistemological divide.]{.underline}

The paper by Brattland and Hausner (forthcoming) addresses the
knowledge-implementation gap by focusing on barriers and solutions to
implementation of Indigenous knowledge in land use governance in Norway.
The IndGov^83^ project brought together a variety of cases of land use
conflicts, where the intersection between wind power development and
reindeer husbandry in the northernmost part of the country is the case
in point. The importance of early inclusion of reindeer herders in wind
power development and taking reindeer husbandry as a linked human-animal
system into account in assessments of land use impacts are some of the
main takeaways from case studies of wind power development in the
northernmost counties Troms and Finnmark. Whereas some positive
developments in terms of inclusion of reindeer husbandry experts in
assessments and willingness of government actors to prioritize this
expertise is noted, [challenges however remain. Compared to how Sámi
knowledge is owned and produced by reindeer herders in the Swedish land
use governance process, the status in Norway is that [Sámi
knowledge]{.mark} of land use [is neither controlled by nor properly
taken into account]{.mark}]{.underline} in land use assessment processes
such as in the case of wind power development on reindeer pasture lands.
Following up on good intentions at all levels of government, including
assessments of effects of development on reindeer husbandry as a
connected human-animal system, and improving participation and data
sovereignty in land-use mapping, are identified as important for the
inclusion of Sami knowledge in land use governance in Norway.

The paper authored by Kennedy et al. introduces the *Moolawang Ngayagang
Yanba* (Come to the Mouth of the Lake with Me) program. This was an
Aboriginal knowledge-based program that gathered together a suite of
environmental and planning decision makers, conservation actors,
scientists and community members working with Lake Illawarra, New South
Wales, Australia. The program sought to introduce the participants to an
Aboriginal Way of Knowing; an Aboriginal epistemology, a relational and
generative way of knowing, that might enable an articulation and
reimagining of their values in relationship to the Lake, and that might
ultimately affect their participation in any future decision-making
processes about the Lake. The design of the program was deliberate and
explicit. It deliberately privileged Aboriginal knowledge but did not
aim to diminish or dismiss other ways of knowing, such as the scientific
knowledge about the Lake, which had been encapsulated in a Land
Management Plan for the Lake and its surrounding environs.^84^ The
program, *Moolawang,* was designed as a container in which knowledge
could be shared, yet where Aboriginal knowledge was explicitly
privileged. If the program had been structured to center the management
plan, and then identify what Aboriginal values were in relation to that
plan, then the intersection of knowledge would have occurred very
differently. Thus, while the plan was ever present, and most
participants had a relationship with the plan, it was not centered nor
privileged. The program actually removed the privilege of those
knowledges that had informed the plan.

6 Conclusion

All five papers, brought together in the dialogue hosted
by INDKNOW series of *Arctic Review on Law and Politics* offer insights
into inclusion of Indigenous knowledges in environmental governance
systems, industry development projects, and decision-making processes.
In all cases, there are still barriers to the recognition of the value
of Indigenous knowledge, even though land rights and the importance of
Indigenous traditional practices may be legally recognized by courts in
all of the countries. Knowledge incorporation is in and of itself a
political project which impacts the degree to which government actors
are willing to make a systematic effort to include Indigenous knowledges
in land use governance and conservation. The cases from Sápmi also
illuminate, while Sámi knowledge is collected for the purpose of
planning and managing, the inclusion of Indigenous knowledges does not
in itself guarantee real influence of Indigenous counter perspectives
and experiences in land use governance and decision-making. For example,
while Indigenous knowledge is partly recognised in legislation
pertaining to reindeer herding, the Sápmi case studies within this issue
reveal challenges, including lack of recognition of the dynamics between
reindeer and humans as a social-ecological system when assessing
impacts; lack of compliance with international human rights law;
industry proponents setting the conditions in impact assessments; and
the privileging of industry perspectives.

The epistemic privileging of scientific and technological knowledge in
these processes, was overcome in the Australian case study via a
deliberate research design that actively privileged Aboriginal knowledge
of the Lake. The Australian case study provides a potential template for
future Indigenous-led research for inclusion of Indigenous knowledges --
the *how* of including Indigenous knowledges in environmental governance
and decision-making processes. Juxtaposed with the Sámi cases, the
recognition of the value of Aboriginal knowledge clearly facilitated its
inclusion in land governance, much more so that in the Sámi cases where
researchers still struggle to privilege Sámi knowledge in land use and
environmental assessments. [As a conclusion, even though there is legal
recognition of Indigenous peoples' rights and the value of Indigenous
knowledges is acknowledged, ensuing [power imbalances are]{.mark} still
[a barrier to be overcome in knowledge inclusion]{.mark}. Engaging
critically with the inherent power imbalances and [asymmetries]{.mark}
that [characterise contemporary global and national governance
frameworks]{.mark}, the frameworks that determine whose voices are
integrated and heard, thus [must remain a key foci of future Indigenous
led land use and decision-making processes and research
projects.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Council, and a resident of the North Slope Borough, Native News Online,

https://nativenewsonline.net/opinion/our-right-to-consultation-will-not-be-ignored)

Nearly 4,000 miles separate Alaska's North Slope, the ancestral
homelands of the North Slope Iñupiat, and Washington D.C. But after
multiple trips between the two to advocate for our self-determination in
our ancestral homelands before the vast bureaucracy of the federal
government, it feels like we live on different planets. This disconnect
is not just physical -- it can be measured by the number of policies
affecting our lands and people crafted by Washington without first
consulting with the North Slope Iñupiat. [Most recently, [the]{.mark}
[fed]{.mark}eral [gov]{.mark}ernment unilaterally [curtailed]{.mark}
[dev]{.mark}elopment [opportunities]{.mark} in the National Petroleum
Reserve in Alaska (NPR-A) [while]{.mark} shamefully [cutting]{.mark}
Regional Alaska [Native]{.mark} tribal [governments]{.mark} like mine
[out]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [discussions]{.mark} to [inform]{.mark}ing the
[policy]{.mark}making [process]{.mark}. As a result, the
administration's NPR-A actions [do not]{.mark} [reflect]{.mark} our
[Indigenous]{.mark} [communities']{.mark} [wishes, will roll back
progress]{.mark} [for]{.mark} [our]{.mark} [people]{.mark}, and imperil
our Iñupiaq culture.]{.underline} To be clear, this is not only a
dangerous dereliction of duty and disrespectful to the North Slope
Iñupiat, who have been the ancestral stewards of our lands for over
10,000 years. [It is a [violation]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
[fed]{.mark}eral [gov]{.mark}ernment['s]{.mark} [obligation]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [consult]{.mark} with Regional Alaska Native tribal
governments, like the Iñupiat Community of the Arctic Slope (ICAS), on
all matters that affect our land. [Without]{.mark} federal consultation,
it is [impossible]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [adequately]{.mark}
[exercise]{.mark} our [sovereign]{.mark} [rights]{.mark} [for]{.mark}
the benefit of [our]{.mark} [communities]{.mark}.]{.underline} On April
19, 2023, the Department of the Interior (DOI) announced that it would
finalize its decision to restrict development in more than 50% of the
NPR-A. DOI did so without consulting our elected leadership about the
impact of its decision on the North Slope Iñupiat. [Had the department
taken the time to speak with us, it would have learned that our
communities do not support this decision--- a fact that the
[fed]{.mark}eral [government]{.mark} was and [continues]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [disregard]{.mark} due to its lack of consultation with the
North Slope Iñupiat. This decision will have massive implications for
the future of our regional economy, our communities, and our
culture.]{.underline} The North Slope relies on tax revenue from
resource development -- more than 95 percent of our region's tax base
comes from taxation of land development. These funds support essential
services like modern water and sewage systems, schools, health clinics,
and world-class research and monitoring of subsistence resources vital
to our culture. Our communities will struggle without these services,
and our culture will become imperiled as a result. Several North Slope
entities have shared detailed letters highlighting these risks and the
urgent need for the federal government to reconsider the faulty economic
analysis supporting its NPR-A rule. The White House's current study does
not sufficiently examine the severe financial impact the rule will have
on our communities and its downstream effects on our ability to provide
essential services. [There is a direct correlation between increased
development in the region and drastic increases in our average life
expectancy from just 34 years in 1969 to 77 years today. By finalizing
its NPR-A rule, DOI's is undoing decades of progress. [We would
have]{.mark} [readily]{.mark} [shared]{.mark} these facts with DOI
[had]{.mark} [it]{.mark} fulfilled its legal obligation to
[consult]{.mark} [with]{.mark} [us]{.mark} [ahead]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
their [mandates]{.mark}, and we remain committed to educating DOI and
the federal government about the unintended consequences of their
actions.]{.underline} But ICAS and other North Slope Iñupiat elected
leaders have repeatedly been ignored by DOI and other agencies. In fact,
Secretary Deb Haaland herself has ignored or denied at least eight
meeting requests from us and other leaders on the North Slope, even
after we traveled thousands of miles to D.C. on multiple occasions. We
have also joined with other North Slope entities to issue unanimous
resolutions on topics ranging from condemning the federal government's
actions and urging on the White House to reevaluating its incomplete
economic analysis, which does not explore the economic and cultural
impacts its policy would have on our people. Notably, the North Slope is
not alone in its protest. [The [Alaska State
Legislature]{.mark}]{.underline} passed the bipartisan HJR20[, a joint
resolution that [calls]{.mark} [on]{.mark} the [fed]{.mark}eral
[gov]{.mark}ernment [to]{.mark} reverse its September 2023 decision on
the NPR-A, further [demonstrat]{.mark}ing the widespread
[support]{.mark} in our state and region [for responsible
development]{.mark}. Given the growing chorus of dissent, it is
[unacceptable]{.mark} [for]{.mark} [Indigenous]{.mark}
[communities]{.mark} like ours [to be tuned out]{.mark} [by]{.mark}
leaders in [Washington]{.mark} -- especially by an administration that
purports to care about our voices.]{.underline} This administration has
issued multiple policy memos and federal strategies claiming Indigenous
people are best served when Tribal governments are empowered to lead.
The federal government's treatment of ICAS and the North Slope Iñupiat,
however, show that this administration's actions fall far short of its
words. [It's time to close this policymaking and communication gap
between Washington and the North Slope Iñupiat. The [fed]{.mark}eral
[gov]{.mark}ernment [must]{.mark} do right by our communities by
[fulfilling]{.mark} its [legal]{.mark} [consultative]{.mark}
[obligations]{.mark} to regional governments before issuing edicts that
could put the future of our communities and culture at risk. Our people
are not some distant civilization beaming messages to Washington from
afar. We are Americans, and we demand that our voices be
heard.]{.underline} Doreen Leavitt is director of natural resources for

#### Consultation is good.

**ELI et al. 16** (Environmental Law Institute in partnership with the
Indigenous Peoples Council for Marine Mammals and with support from the
Marine Mammal Commission. , "Model Alaska Native Consultation
Procedures", January 2016,
https://www.eli.org/research-report/handbook-model-alaska-native-consultation-procedures
)

The following represents the consultation policy of the
\[tribe/authorized tribal organization\]: a) [The primary objective of
consultation is to promote the interests of the \[tribe/authorized
tribal organization\] in marine mammal resources. Specifically, the
objective of consultation is to conduct meaningful multi-party
information sharing so that an understanding of perspectives is achieved
and those perspectives are given meaningful consideration before agency
action occurs, in order to identify, avoid, and mitigate negative
impacts to tribes; b) Federal agencies are responsible for initiating
consultation when proposed actions may affect marine mammals and Alaska
Native communities.]{.underline} Such federal actions may affect
management decisions about marine mammals, the ecosystem and resources
upon which marine mammals rely, or the [[ability]{.underline}]{.mark} of
Alaska [[Natives to harvest]{.underline}]{.mark} and utilize marine
mammals. [Tribes reserve the right to initiate consultation whenever
consultation is warranted under Part III of these
procedures;]{.underline} c) The [consultation process is part of a
spectrum of engagement between federal agencies and Alaska Native
communities, which ranges from informal communication to co-management
and cooperative decision-making.]{.underline} The consultation process
should enhance and not undermine other types of engagement between the
federal government and Alaska Natives; d) Trust, respect, and ongoing
[relationships are keys to success in consultation.]{.underline}
Meaningful dialogue between Alaska Natives and federal agencies should
be ongoing; e) Consultation with tribes is conducted on the basis of a
government-to-government relationship. This relationship is based on the
recognition of tribal sovereignty, and tribes and federal agencies are
equal participants in the consultation process; f) Consultation should
involve [parties who have decision-making authority;]{.underline} g)
Consultation [should be initiated early at the time when actions are
first contemplated, well before decisions are made, and must occur often
in the decision-making process. Consultation obligations continue until
the federal action is final;]{.underline} h) Once consultation is
initiated, [there is an agency obligation to communicate if and how
consultation affected agency decisionmaking.]{.underline} If
consultation did not affect the decision, the agency should provide an
explanation; i) Meaningful discussions involve a two-way exchange of
information and perspectives, and the information provided will be
considered and incorporated in the design, development, implementation,
and revision of federal government actions; [j) Exchange of information
and perspectives should be conducted in a style and language appropriate
for the community involved]{.underline} and 7 if needed translators
should be provided by the consulting agency; and k) Appropriate meeting
opportunities are critical to the success of consultation. Funding for
consultation is also critical, and therefore the consulting agency
should provide funding for the participation of tribal representatives
and for other key expenses in consultation process, where possible.

 

#### Consulting and collaborating with indigenous peoples has a multitude of benefits

Strong links between colonialism and science have long dominated an
assumption in the world of research that 'Western methods and ways of
knowing are the only objective, true science' (Simonds and Christopher
2013, p 2185). Indigenous Peoples became 'objects' of research (Kovach
2009) and, in the words of Linda Tuhiwai Smith (2012), 'research has not
been neutral in its objectification of the Other \[of Indigenous
Peoples\]. Objectification is a process of dehumanization' (p 41). To
address 'Western academic oppression' of Indigenous societies 'in the
name of science' (Simonds and Christopher 2013, p 2185[), Indigenous
rights holders and [Indigenous and non-Indigenous scholars]{.mark}
increasingly emphasize the [need]{.mark} to [decolonize
research]{.mark}]{.underline} (Wilson 2008). Smith (2012) [argues for
research design [and]{.mark} protocols that [incorporate Indigenous ways
of knowing and being, and render '\[Indigenous\] values
central]{.mark}]{.underline} to the research project' (p 189[).
Collaborative and partnership approaches to research, such as
community-based participatory research, participatory action research,
and Indigenous research methodologies, have been identified as a means
of addressing colonial legacies]{.underline} (de Leeuw et al 2012,
Sylvestre et al 2017, Saxinger and First Nation of Nacho Nyäk Dun 2018).
In contrast to Western, independent, researcher-led approaches,
participatory approaches aim to establish long-term engagement and
commitment based on 'a process by which decision-making power and
ownership is shared between the researcher and the community involved;
bi-directional research capacity and co-learning are promoted; and new
knowledge is co-created and disseminated in a manner that is mutually
beneficial.' (Castleden et al 2012, p 162[). [Over the past decade,
**co-creative approaches have been implemented widely in the
Arctic**]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g. Armitage et al 2011, Castleden et al
2012, Cooke et al 2020, Nilsson et al 2021). Greenhalgh et al (2016)
define the ['co-creation' process as 'the collaborative generation of
knowledge by academics working alongside stakeholders from other
sectors]{.underline}' (p 393). According to Sherriff et al (2019[),
[this process builds on collaborative research methods]{.mark} 'that
recognize power imbalances brought about by social inequities and use
strength-based empowerment approaches to address community
needs']{.underline} (p 372). The concept of co-creation refers to 'the
active involvement of end-users' (Voorberg et al 2014, p 3). This
resonates with numerous calls from across the Arctic for sincere
collaboration (e.g. Fox et al 2020). Others employ the notion of
'co-production' of knowledge, aptly defined by Cooke et al (2020) as
'the contribution of multiple knowledge sources, ways of knowing, and
perspectives from different user groups with the goal of co‐creating
knowledge and information \[...\]' (pp 90--91), and call for moving
beyond Indigenous 'participation' to partnership in research (Wilson et
al 2020). In this paper, we use the term 'co-creation', as it alludes to
the making of something new out of a collaborative process. This links
well with the idea of creating societal change via action-oriented
research. Our experiences resonate with Greenhalgh et al (2016), who
state that co-creation, operating at the science--policy--society
interface, 'has potential for 'moving beyond the ivory towers' to
deliver significant societal impact via dynamic, locally adaptive
community--academic partnerships' (p 202). As noted by Voorberg et al
(2014, p 3), we acknowledge that [**both terms ('co-creation' and
'co-production') are connected and relate to other terms such as
'community involvement'.** However, in our view, 'community involvement'
expresses a less equal level of cooperation]{.underline}. Inuit
frameworks, such as the Qaggiq Model or the Inuit Food Security Concept,
illustrate how multiple ways of knowing may be supported (Healey and
Tagak 2014, ICC-Alaska 2015, McGrath 2019). [A large body of [empirical
literature highlights the benefits]{.mark} that can emerge [from
co-creative partnerships between Indigenous rights holders and
researchers.]{.mark} These include: relationships built on mutual
understanding and respect, community empowerment, strong leadership,
reciprocity and mutual learning, capacity building, and cultural
safety]{.underline} (e.g. Castleden et al 2012, Lewis and Boyd 2012,
Greenhalgh et al 2016, Scherriff et al 2019, Fox et al 2020, Wilson et
al 2020). A precondition for positive outcomes is a research process
guided by an inclusive, 'respectful and engaged manner---from the
identification of research needs to study design, data collection,
interpretation, and application---with the idea of creating actionable
science \[...\] and benefits to the partners involved' (Cooke et al
2020, p 91).

#### Consultations key to obtaining tangible benefits and avoiding harmful violations and alternatives

The Duty to Consult With Indigenous Peoples, UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO
PRESS, DOI: 10.3138/utlj.67.1

the safeguard role of [consultations In general, public
[consultations]{.mark} are one of several mechanisms [used to
achieve]{.mark} an appropriate [balance]{.mark} [between]{.mark} the
[rights]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [obligations]{.mark} [of]{.mark} different
stakeholders in plural [societies]{.mark}. However, as we have
explained, consultations in [relation to indigenous peoples are
distinct]{.mark} in that they [**safeguard against violations of human
rights**,]{.mark} [including indigenous]{.mark} peoples\' [specific
rights]{.mark} which have been [internationally affirmed]{.mark}. The
protected rights include, in addition to rights of participation and
selfdetermination, rights to property, culture, religion,
non-discrimination in relation to lands, territories, and natural
resources, and the right of indigenous peoples to set and pursue their
own priorities for economic, social, and cultural
development]{.underline}.3 Notably, a practical import of the safeguard
role is [that [states]{.mark} are [obligated]{.mark} [to]{.mark} take an
active role, [protect]{.mark}ing the best **[interests]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} [indigenous]{.mark} [peoples]{.mark}** at all times and not
only [during]{.mark} the [process]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[consultation]{.mark}.]{.underline} For their part, consistent with the
increasingly accepted view, business enterprises, at least as a matter
of sound policy, have an independent 31 See, in particular, UN
Indigenous Declaration, supra note 4; ILO Convention no 169, supra note
3; OAS Indigenous Declaration, supra note 4. MITIGATING STATE
SOVEREIGNTY 457 responsibility to respect human rights. 2 Accordingly,
[business enterprises should both conduct due diligence before
proceeding with a project and refrain from proceeding without it, in
order to insure that adequate consultations have been undertaken and
that implementation of the project does not infringe the internationally
recognized substantive rights of indigenous peoples.]{.underline} Yet,
the safeguard role should not eclipse the role of consultation as a
balancing mechanism. This implies that, in addition to its safeguard
role, the duty to consult also plays a remedial function when rights can
be affected. [[Consultations]{.mark} not only serve to **[avert
limitation of indigenous peoples\' rights]{.mark}** but [also]{.mark} to
[align terms to]{.mark} offset, or [compensate]{.mark} [for]{.mark}, any
resulting limitations or potential [violations]{.mark} [suffered]{.mark}
[by]{.mark} the [indigenous]{.mark} party. Whether or not indigenous
consent in particular circumstances is strictly required (an issue that
we explore below), **[states need to protect the rights of indigenous
peoples at all times]{.mark}.**]{.underline} 2 minimum standards to
achieve protection The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous
Peoples, together with other sources of authority, demands certain
requirements of consultations in order to adequately achieve the
protective role. [By demanding a minimum standard of protection, the
[duty to consult]{.mark} not only [imposes]{.mark} procedural
[requirements]{.mark} [that]{.mark} [protect]{.mark} [against]{.mark}
[arbitrariness]{.mark} but also attempts to [ensure]{.mark}
[balanced]{.mark} substantive [outcomes]{.mark} among unequal
stakeholders]{.underline}. The minimum procedural and substantive
requirements that have been articulated by a number of sources are
synthesized and summarized in the following paragraphs. This synthesis
is drawn from one of the authors\' previous work in his capacity as UN
special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples.3 3 a Procedural
requirements. Good faith effort to secure rights on agreed terms: In
sum, [consultations must be done in good faith, through culturally
appropriate procedures, and with the objective of reaching agreement on
just terms. Thus, consultation processes shall actively contribute to
the prior assessment of all potential impacts of the proposed measure,
including the extent to the indigenous peoples\' substantive rights and
interests may be affected. In addition, [consultation procedures are key
to the search for less harmful alternatives, **obtaining tangible
benefits**, and advancing the enjoyment of indigenous peoples\' human
rights]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--Internal Link\-\--I Law

#### UNDRIP's FPIC makes consultation [necessary]{.underline} for international law.

\[https://www.lyellcollection.org/doi/full/10.3389/esss.2024.10117\]

One example of this is [The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of
Indigenous Peoples **[(UNDRIP)]{.mark}**]{.underline} **which was
adopted in [2007]{.underline} and [[establishes a]{.mark} universal
[framework of]{.mark} minimum [standards for]{.mark} the [survival,
dignity and wellbeing of Indigenous People]{.mark}s]{.underline}**
[worldwide (]{.underline}United Nations, 2015[)]{.underline}. UNDRIP
[stipulates that Indigenous Peoples are]{.underline} not solely
stakeholders in potential extractive projects but instead, they are
[right holders]{.underline}. The [ratification of [UNDRIP led to change
throughout the Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, in Greenland,
the 30 year old "Greenland Home Rule Arrangement" was replaced in 2009
by the Act on [Greenland Self Government.]{.underline} This [provided
the legal basis for Greenland gaining authority]{.underline}, previously
held by Denmark, in matters exclusively [related to Greenlandic domestic
affairs and natural resources]{.underline} (International Energy Agency,
2023). Furthermore, in 2011, the Government of Sweden added a reform to
the Constitution, stipulating that the Government shall encourage
opportunities for the Sámi people and for other ethnic, linguistic and
religious minorities in Sweden to preserve and develop their own culture
and community life (Human Rights Council Report, 2014).

An integral [[part of UNDRIP is]{.underline}]{.mark} the notion of
**[[Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC)]{.underline}]{.mark} which
[[stipulates]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[states must have obtained free,
prior and informed consent before adopting and
implementing]{.mark}]{.underline} legislative or administrative
[[measures which impact Indigenous Peoples.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The
recognition and promotion of the Free Prior Informed Consent is an
important [p[rinciple of engaging with Indigenous peoples during mining
projects]{.mark}]{.underline} and has become very [[important
worldwide]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The International Finance
Corporation,]{.underline} a member of the World Bank, has [created eight
performance standards]{.underline} which aim [to provide
guidance]{.underline} on how to avoid, mitigate and manage risks so that
business is conducted in a sustainable way (International Finance
Corporation, 2012a). These [standards recognise]{.underline} that
**[[Indigenous]{.underline}]{.mark} Peoples may be particularly
[[vulnerable to]{.underline}]{.mark} the adverse [[impacts associated
with project development]{.underline}]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} including the
l[[oss of identity, culture, and natural resource-based
livelihoods]{.underline}]{.mark} (International Finance Corporation,
2012b). The implementation of [[FPIC]{.underline}]{.mark} has also been
[[seen in]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[mining
industry]{.underline}]{.mark}. In 2013, the [[International Council on
Mining and Metals (ICMM) published]{.underline}]{.mark} a position
[[statement on]{.underline} the [rights of Indigenous peoples
incorporating FPIC principles and promoting constructive relationships
between mining companies and Indigenous peoples.]{.underline}]{.mark}
ICMM noted the increase in acknowledgement and application of FPIC in
the mining industry since the Mining, Minerals and Sustainable
Development (MMSD) initiative was completed, 12 years ago.

### 2NC\-\--Internal Link\-\--Self-Determination

#### Lack of federal consultation undermines self-determination.

Doreen **Leavitt 24** \[director of natural resources for the Iñupiat
Community of the Arctic Slope (ICAS), secretary of the Tribal Council,
and a resident of the North Slope Borough\]
\[https://nativenewsonline.net/opinion/our-right-to-consultation-will-not-be-ignored\]
\[5/1/2024\]

This disconnect is not just physical -- it can be measured by the number
of policies affecting our lands and people crafted by Washington without
first consulting with the North Slope Iñupiat. Most recently, the
[**[fed]{.mark}eral [gov]{.mark}ernment unilaterally [curtailed
dev]{.mark}elopment [opportunities in]{.mark} the National Petroleum
Reserve in Alaska [(NPR-A) while]{.mark}** shamefully **[cutting]{.mark}
Regional [Alaska Native tribal governments]{.mark} like mine [out
of]{.mark} discussions to informing [the]{.mark} [policymaking
process]{.mark}.** As a result, [the **administration's NPR-A actions do
not reflect** ]{.mark}**our [Indigenous communities'
wishes]{.mark}**]{.underline}, will roll back progress for our people,
and imperil our Iñupiaq culture.

To be clear, this is not only a dangerous dereliction of duty and
disrespectful to the North Slope Iñupiat, who have been the ancestral
stewards of our lands for over 10,000 years. [[It is a violation
of]{.mark} the [fed]{.mark}eral [gov]{.mark}ernment's [obligation to
consult]{.mark} with Regional Alaska [Native tribal
governments]{.mark},]{.underline} like the Iñupiat Community of the
Arctic Slope (ICAS), on all matters that affect our land. [**[Without
federal consultation, it is impossible to]{.mark} adequately
[exercise]{.mark} our [sovereign rights for the benefit of]{.mark} our
[communities.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

On April 19, 2023, the [Department of the Interior [(DOI)
]{.mark}]{.underline}[announced]{.mark} [that it would finalize its
[decision to]{.mark} [restrict development in more than 50% of the
NPR-A]{.mark}. DOI did so [without consulting]{.mark}]{.underline} our
elected leadership about the impact of its decision on the North Slope
Iñupiat. Had the department taken the time to speak with us, it would
have learned that our [**[communities do not support this
decision]{.mark}---** a fact that the **[federal government]{.mark} was
and continues to [disregard due to its lack of consultation]{.mark}**
with the North Slope Iñupiat.]{.underline}

[[This **decision will have**]{.mark} **massive [implications for the
future of our]{.mark} regional [economy]{.mark}, our [communities,
and]{.mark} our [culture]{.mark}.**]{.underline} The North Slope relies
on tax revenue from resource development -- more than 95 percent of our
region's tax base comes from taxation of land development. These funds
support essential services like modern water and sewage systems,
schools, health clinics, and world-class research and monitoring of
subsistence resources vital to our culture[. **Our [communities will
struggle]{.mark} without these services, and our [culture will become
imperiled]{.mark} as a result.**]{.underline}

Several North Slope entities have shared detailed letters highlighting
these risks and the urgent need for the federal government to reconsider
the faulty economic analysis supporting its NPR-A rule. The [**[White
House's]{.mark} current [study does not]{.mark} sufficiently [examine
the severe]{.mark} financial [impact the rule will have on]{.mark} our
[communities]{.mark} and its downstream effects on our ability to
provide essential services.**]{.underline} There is a direct correlation
between increased development in the region and drastic increases in our
average life expectancy from just 34 years in 1969 to 77 years today. By
finalizing its NPR-A rule, DOI's is undoing decades of progress.

We would have readily shared these facts with DOI had it fulfilled its
legal obligation to consult with us ahead of their mandates, and we
remain committed to educating DOI and the federal government about the
unintended consequences of their actions. But [[ICAS]{.mark} and other
North Slope Iñupiat elected leaders [have repeatedly]{.mark} [been
ignored by]{.mark} DOI and other [agencies]{.mark}. In fact,
**[Secretary]{.mark} Deb [Haaland]{.mark} herself has ignored or
[denied]{.mark} at least [eight meeting requests from]{.mark} us and
other [leaders on the North Slope,]{.mark} even after we traveled
thousands of miles to D.C. on multiple occasions.**]{.underline}

We have also joined with other North Slope entities to issue unanimous
resolutions on topics ranging from condemning the federal government's
actions and urging on the White House to reevaluating its incomplete
economic analysis, which does not explore the economic and cultural
impacts its policy would have on our people. Notably, the North Slope is
not alone in its protest. The Alaska State Legislature passed the
bipartisan HJR20, a joint resolution that calls on the federal
government to reverse its September 2023 decision on the NPR-A, further
demonstrating the widespread support in our state and region for
responsible development.

[Given the growing chorus of dissent, **[it is unacceptable for
Indigenous communities]{.mark} like ours to [be tuned out by leaders in
Washington]{.mark}** --]{.underline} especially by an administration
that purports to care about our voices. This administration has issued
multiple policy memos and federal strategies claiming Indigenous people
are best served when Tribal governments are empowered to lead. [**[The
fed]{.mark}eral [gov]{.mark}ernment's [treatment of ICAS and]{.mark} the
[North Slope Iñupiat]{.mark}**, however, **[show]{.mark} that this
[administration's actions fall]{.mark} far [short of its
words.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[[**It's time to close this policymaking and communication gap between
Washington and the North Slope Iñupiat**.]{.mark}]{.underline} The
federal government must do right by our communities by fulfilling its
legal consultative obligations to regional governments before issuing
edicts that could put the future of our communities and culture at risk.
Our people are not some distant civilization beaming messages to
Washington from afar. **[[We are Americans, and we demand that our
voices be heard.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### 2NC\-\--AT: Consult Now Solves

#### Consultation is not good now -- the CP allows for the US to prioritize consent in consultations

**Tallgrass Institute '21** (Tallgrass Institute, "Tribal Nations,
Indigenous Peoples Call for the U.S. to Prioritize the Inherent Right of
Consent in Consultations," 7/30/21 Accessed 7/29/25,
https://www.colorado.edu/program/tallgrass/2021/07/30/tribal-nations-indigenous-peoples-call-us-prioritize-inherent-right-consent-consultations)

In 2010, [[the United States]{.underline}]{.mark} endorsed the United
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and
upheld Executive Order 13175, which [[requires consultation]{.mark} and
coordination [with tribal officials]{.mark}]{.underline}. This was
further upheld in January 2021 with the Biden Administration's
Memorandum on Tribal Consultation and Strengthening Nation-to-Nation
Relationships. While an important way to support better
government-to-government relationships, consultation alone does not
guarantee participatory and decision-making rights. Consultation is a
process to reach consensus, whereas consent encompasses a Tribe's right
to have their perspectives meaningfully integrated into planning and
implementation. Despite treaty obligations to Tribes and commitments to
consultation written into federal guidelines, the United States\'
policies still do not adequately take into account tribal and Native
knowledge, expertise and perspectives. The consultation framework falls
far short of providing opportunities for meaningful dialogue and
decision-making. For example, [[the current consultation
framework]{.mark} generally [does not contemplate a timeline for project
changes]{.mark} should there be consensus around an alternative plan.
Thus, [Indigenous leaders' expertise and priorities]{.mark} might be
heard, but they [are not integrated in a way that protects their rights
and resources]{.mark}.]{.underline} The United States' consultation-only
approach has contributed to continuing and escalating human rights
violations for Tribes and Native peoples. Since Executive Order 13175
was issued in 2000, there have been multiple instances where Native
peoples have been put at risk of irreparable damage to ancestral lands
and sacred places, such as Bears Ears, the Black Hills, Chaco Canyon,
Menominee River, Standing Rock, White Earth, and the coastal plain of
the Arctic Refuge, among many more. Each of these, in different ways, is
emblematic of the lack of decision-making power Indigenous People
currently have to care for their ancestral territories and to protect
their lifeways. With culmination of the Red Road to DC and the arrival
of the Lummi Nation House of Tears totem pole in Washington DC this week
comes an urgent message from Indigenous leaders, Native communities,
frontline defenders and allies: prioritize consent in all processes,
policies and projects where Indigenous Peoples may be affected. ["[There
is no time to waste to protect the most sacred places where Indigenous
peoples pray, gather traditional foods and medicines, get drinking
water, and visit to remind themselves of the ways their ancestors lived
since time began]{.mark},"]{.underline} states the Red Road to DC
website. [[The consent framework is best upheld through free, prior and
informed consent]{.mark} (FPIC)]{.underline}. As enumerated in the
UNDRIP, protocols and processes around FPIC can help protect sacred
places and safeguard all of the rights of Indigenous Peoples because it
places Indigenous leadership in positions of decision-making authority.
Utilizing the minimum standards set forth by the UNDRIP, Indigenous
Peoples throughout the world have established robust protocols around
FPIC, and non-Indigenous governments are beginning to catch up. Canada
passed legislation in June to align Canadian law with the UNDRIP, and a
recent court decision in British Columbia sees First Nations treaty
rights upheld in a way that prioritizes participation in
decision-making[. [Now is the time for the United States to prioritize
consent in consultations with Tribes.]{.underline}]{.mark} [Too many
sacred places are being turned into commodities for economic gain by
outside entities, rather than respected for their value as culturally
significant and life sustaining to Native peoples.]{.underline} As the
United States prioritizes a renewed commitment to a
government-to-government relationship with Indigenous Peoples, free,
prior and informed consent is a critical next step.

over to her group of five who were getting acquainted over lunch. We had
the same idea, [to sneak away during a break at [the Arctic
Circle]{.underline} Assembly]{.mark} in Reykjavik, Iceland, and get some
work done. As they chatted over coffee, I couldn't help but notice that
although their conversation was focused on Indigenous consultations, not
one person in their group was native. Their conversation mirrored many I
had that weekend[: [Indigenous communities are a key stakeholder in the
Arctic, and governments, businesses, and the social sector wanted them
at the table to collaborate. While I'm happy to see organizations
prioritize this engagement, its **execution nearly always
fails.**]{.mark}]{.underline} As the co-founder of the Aboriginal
Professional Association of Canada, my work has taken me across Canada
working with Indigenous leaders and youth. Through these meetings I have
heard firsthand how too **[[often Indigenous consultations are a
check-the-box exercise.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Organizers invite
communities to the table and discussions begin. Sometimes the process
lasts several months, and although stakeholders make concessions,
[[communities lack full authority over their traditional lands. If
conversations break down or the community does not want development
altogether, the case is brought to the courts.]{.mark}]{.underline} Last
November, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in favor of building a ski
resort on sacred First Nations land in British Columbia's Jumbo Valley.
The decision put an end to a 26-year legal battle, allowing development
on land the Ktunaxa Nation consider sacred, as it is home to the Grizzly
Bear Spirit. The community claims that any settlement on the land will
push the spirit from the area, **[[making their spiritual rituals
meaningless]{.underline}]{.mark}**. On one side, Ktunaxa Nation, a
nation of six Indigenous communities. On the other, a 6,000-unit, \$900
million ski resort.

The seminal Lancet series from 2020, highlights that [[racism]{.mark},
[xenophobia and discrimination are]{.mark} fundamental [determinants of
health]{.mark}. In order to promote social equity, health professionals,
researchers, societies, need to acknowledge these determinants as a
public health issue (Devakumar et al. ]{.underline}Citation2022[).
Paradies (]{.underline}Citation2018[) contends that [racism
affect]{.mark}ing [Indigenous peoples]{.mark} operates [at multiple
levels]{.mark} -- [internalized, interpersonal, and systemic]{.mark} --
[and is]{.mark} intricately [tied to the]{.mark} historical [impacts of
colonization on]{.mark} Indigenous [communities]{.mark}. Loss of land
[disrupted]{.mark} traditional [lifestyles and access to
resources]{.mark}, new [diseases brought by colonizers caused]{.mark}
devastating [epidemics]{.mark}, **economic [exploitation]{.mark}**
[created]{.mark} economic [disparities and eroded]{.mark} cultural
[identity and language]{.mark}s affecting and [harming physical and
mental wellbeing]{.mark}. The ongoing impact of [colonization has
produced **systemic inequities**]{.mark} in healthcare, education and
social services that continue to affect health (Axelsson, Kukutai, and
Kippen ]{.underline}Citation2016[; Kairuz et
al. ]{.underline}Citation2021[; Maddox et
al. ]{.underline}Citation2024[).]{.underline}

Notably, research indicates that [Indigenous [individuals experience
worse health and social outcomes than non-Indigenous
individuals]{.mark}, with [racism playing a significant role]{.mark}
(Harris et al. ]{.underline}Citation2024[). Racism and discrimination
[accumulate throughout a person's life]{.mark}, [triggering **stress
responses and hormonal changes** that heighten the risk of]{.mark}
non-communicable [diseases and accelerate]{.mark} biological
[aging]{.mark}. This [trauma is]{.mark} also [passed down to]{.mark}
future generations, impacting the [children]{.mark} of those initially
affected through intricate biopsychosocial mechanisms. The [underlying
cause]{.mark} of these effects [is racism]{.mark}, [not race]{.mark}
itself (Devakumar et al. ]{.underline}Citation2020[).]{.underline}

Studies from the circumpolar North are in line with these findings
(Hansen Citation2015; Ramraj et al. Citation2016), and emphasize the
knowledge gap in this area due to lack of consistent data on general
health and well-being (AHDR Citation2015; Young et al. Citation2020).
[However, the [lack of ethnicity-based registers complicates the
differentiation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous
populations]{.mark} (Anderson et al. ]{.underline}Citation2016[),
[different definitions of ethnicity]{.mark} can [capture varying
segments of a population]{.mark} (Hansen et
al. ]{.underline}Citation2016[ ), and [some groups]{.mark}, such as
those living on reserves, are sometimes [excluded from]{.mark}
large-scale [studies]{.mark} (Ramraj et
al. ]{.underline}Citation2016[).]{.underline} Scoping reviews on
Indigenous populations emphasize the importance of recognizing distinct
groups within broader samples to avoid homogenizing diverse cultures
(Uink et al. Citation2022). [They also highlight the significant health
impacts of racism (Kairuz et al. ]{.underline}Citation2021[) and stress
that [**anti-racist interventions** must target multiple levels]{.mark}
-- [individual, organizational, and societal]{.mark}]{.underline} -- to
effectively dismantle systems of oppression affecting non-White and
Indigenous peoples (Hassen et al. Citation2021).

The research landscape in the circumpolar north reveals a terminological
divide: [while countries such as [Canada and the USA]{.mark} routinely
[collect data on]{.mark} race and explore [racism]{.mark}, the [Nordic
nations instead opt for]{.mark} the terminology of
[ethnicity]{.mark}.]{.underline} Researchers in the Nordic context often
focus on ethnic discrimination rather than racism
(Kyllingstad Citation2017; Osanami Törngren Citation2022).

[[Indigenous consultation is vital to addressing health disparities by
ensuring that]{.mark} culturally [responsive policies]{.mark} that align
with community need [are adopted]{.mark}. [Input is]{.mark} especially
[important]{.mark} when the policy directly affects Indigenous health
and well-being, such as the COVID-19 response.26 Moreover,
[because]{.mark} [patient involvement in health care decisions is
associated with improved health outcomes]{.mark}27,28 [and]{.mark}
community [consulqtations are linked to increased **intervention
efficacy**]{.mark},29 engaging Indigenous populations in health policy
decisions [may reduce **health disparities**]{.mark}. Because a
[substantial portion of the legal framework is occupied by states that
have the authority to]{.mark} recognize and [consult]{.mark} with [any
Indigenous community]{.mark}, this study focuses on state consultation
laws with Indigenous communities, inclusive of state-recognized and
unrecognized Indigenous communities. This article reviews Indigenous
consultation laws identified through a search of all 50 states, the
District of Columbia, and 5 US territories to provide a comprehensive
baseline to better understand the scope of Indigenous consultation
laws.]{.underline}

#### Federal consultation frameworks are critical to redressing colonial harms and improving Indigenous health and self-determination---good-faith negotiation, informed consent, and early engagement are key.

Although **[[Indigenous consultation under international law is
aspirational]{.mark},]{.underline}** certain key principles have
emerged. First, a [mutually agreeable decision requires a good-faith
effort]{.underline}. This means that [[consultation must occur before a
decision is made^9^]{.underline}]{.mark} and full information, including
alternatives, must be provided to Indigenous communities to meet the
principle of noncoercion. The [final principle set out on international
free, prior, and informed consent mandates that consent be
obtained^9^]{.underline}; [however, **[many settler governments have
been unwilling to relinquish this control when they perceive larger
benefits to society than to Indigenous
communities]{.underline}**.^[10]{.underline}^]{.mark} The United States
presently has 574 federally recognized tribes,^[11]{.underline}^ 66
state-recognized Indigenous communities,^[12]{.underline}^ and myriad
unrecognized Indigenous communities with retained ties to land and
culture.^[13]{.underline}^ Before the Clinton administration, federal
consultation was conducted on a case-by-case basis. In 1993, executive
order 12866 was issued, which mandated consultation with tribal leaders
before the imposition of regulatory requirements.^[14]{.underline}^ In
1998, executive order 13084 expanded consultation to include meaningful
input on regulatory developments.^[15]{.underline}^ Finally, in 2000,
executive order 13175**[, [the existing consultation framework, mandated
federal executive agencies to consult with tribal leaders before issuing
regulatory decisions with tribal implications]{.mark}.2]{.underline}**
Disruptions to ways of life among Indigenous communities after initial
contact **[[with European settlers resulted in persistent health
disparities]{.mark}16]{.underline}**^,[17]{.underline}^ among

Indigenous people]{.underline}**, **[redresses prior

[**[Through consultation, tribes have advocated for increased federal

#### Funding indigenous research breaks historical colonial hierarchies.

**Holmberg et al. 23** ("Towards Arctic Research Upholding Indigenous
Peoples' Rights: Recommendations for ICARP IV, the International
Conference on Arctic Research Planning" January 2023,

[Indigenous knowledge has developed over millennia and offers invaluable
insights into sustainable practices and environmental baselines and
changes. Indigenous communities and researchers have always led research
in which Indigenous Peoples defined their own research priorities and
methodologies.]{.underline} Today, Indigenous-led r[esearch can be
co-creative or autonomous.]{.underline} As part of the right to
selfdetermination, I[ndigenous Peoples have the right to choose how,
when, and where to share their knowledge. Indigenous communities may be
wary of external researchers due to historical exploitation and a lack
of genuine collaboration in the past.]{.underline} As some Indigenous
knowledge is of economic value, and some topics are culturally sensitive
and prone to misinterpretation, [not all topics of research are suitable
for outside researchers. Colonial hierarchies and structural racism
within the Western academy hinder Indigenous leadership and
recognition,]{.underline} and there are challenges in reconciling
radically distinct value-systems, worldviews, and land-use practices.
[Indigenous and particularly Indigenous-led research programs face
chronic underfunding and there is a systematic lack of Indigenous
influence over the funding of research.]{.underline} Yet, Indigenous
people, including youth, [are well positioned to excel as leaders in
Arctic research. Supporting them through paid research positions,
mentorship, outreach and engagement will enhance Indigenous-led
research, community wellbeing, and self-determination.]{.underline}

#### Consultation is essential for arctic governance.

**Saami Council. 25** The Saami Council is a voluntary Saami
organization (a non--governmental organization), with Saami member
organizations in Finland, Russia, Norway and Sweden.Since it was founded
in 1956 the Saami Council has actively dealt with Saami policy tasks.
https://arctic-council.org/news/the-importance-of-the-arctic-council-for-indigenous-peoples/HH

The category of Permanent Participants is a unique model of including
Indigenous Peoples in decision-making. It was created to provide Arctic
Indigenous Peoples with the means of active participation and full
consultation in the Council's deliberations[. **[The Arctic
Council]{.mark} [is the only international body]{.mark} that has
[accredited Indigenous Peoples]{.mark} this status**]{.underline}. In
this article Permanent Participants reflect on the importance of the
Council for them -- and vice versa. In general, [**[the engagement by
Arctic Indigenous Peoples in the Arctic Council is]{.mark} guided by the
understanding that healthy and [productive ecosystems, both on land and
in marine environments, are fundamental to the cultures, identities, and
livelihoods of Arctic Indigenous Peoples.]{.mark} These cultures rely on
local food sources and traditional materials to maintain health, safety,
and well-being. [Indigenous Knowledge]{.mark} [has]{.mark} [been]{.mark}
generated and [passed down for generations]{.mark}, [ensuring a balanced
relationship]{.mark} with the surroundings and the environment. However,
[climate change, pollution, land use changes, and encroachments are
altering natural landscapes and threatening Indigenous ways]{.mark} of
life.** The Arctic Council is important, as our homelands and matters
related to these lands and waters are on the Arctic Council agenda. The
Permanent Participants are at the Arctic Council table to address the
challenges the Arctic Indigenous Peoples are facing and amplify the
voices of Arctic Indigenous Peoples. Since the first gathering of Arctic
Indigenous Peoples in Copenhagen in 1973**, [cooperation among
Indigenous Peoples]{.mark} across the circumpolar region has evolved
significantly. From early efforts to [unify Indigenous Peoples']{.mark}
voices in addressing shared con**cerns to achieving formal recognition
in international cooperation,]{.underline} the journey has been marked
by both challenges and accomplishments. At the heart of this progress is
the Arctic Council, an intergovernmental forum that has provided Arctic
Indigenous Peoples with a seat at the table to shape policies affecting
their lands, cultures, and ways of life.

Approximately **[[4 million]{.mark} [people in]{.mark}habit the
[Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} and the [region [occupies]{.mark} an area
of \>[33 million km^2^]{.mark}, [spanning 8
countries]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Murray et al., 1998). The Arctic is
home to over [[40]{.mark} different [Indigenous groups including Sámi,
Aleut, Inuit, and Yupik]{.mark} communities who are spread across
Northern Europe, North America, Russia and Greenland]{.underline} (WWF
Arctic, 2023). Indigenous people **[[make up]{.underline}]{.mark} around
[[10% of the population of the Arctic]{.mark},]{.underline}** 53% in the
Northern Territories of Canada, 92% in Greenland, 76% in the Norwegian
Arctic, 46% in the Swedish Arctic, 46% in the Finnish Arctic and 9% in
the Russian Arctic (Young and Bjerregaard, 2019 and references therein).
This northern land encompasses a myriad of natural environments and
ecosystems transcending borders between nations and cultures.

[Throughout]{.underline} its [history, the [Arctic peoples and land have
been]{.mark} continuously [impacted by European trade, capitalism and
**extractive industries** through]{.mark}]{.underline} the process of
**[[colonization]{.underline},]{.mark}** as well as [global
systems]{.underline} which continue to [shape]{.underline} the
[developments]{.underline} in this complex region (Greenberg, 2009). The
history of resource extraction in the Arctic is by no means clear-cut:
these [[industries have]{.underline}]{.mark} undoubtedly [[shaped
the]{.underline}]{.mark} environmental and political [[identity of the
Arctic, whilst]{.underline}]{.mark} consecutively [[exerting influence
over Indigenous and local communities, **affecting their ability to
uphold their Indigenous culture**]{.mark}]{.underline} and way of life.
[Many of these pressures came from the]{.underline} increasing
environmental, social and economic [impact of different
industries]{.underline} (Zentner et al., 2019; Fohringer et al., 2021;
Hanaček et al., 2022).

rested on the proposition that the intertribal coalition and UDB
prepared over many years, which described the cultural significance of
Bears Ears. 271 Tribal negotiators for the Secretarial Order also
dedicated substantial amounts of time to educating federal negotiators

[[Among]{.underline}]{.mark} many [[non-Indigenous

[[marked by]{.mark} a series of events]{.underline} [clustered
in]{.underline} the last two decades of [[the Cold
War]{.underline}]{.mark}, which signaled a heightened global interest in
the Far North. From President Nixon's references to Arctic cooperation
in his 1971 National Security Decision Memorandum and the United States'
Arctic Science Policy paper in 1984, to President Gorbachev's pro-Arctic
cooperation Murmansk speech in 1987 and the ratification of the

states indicated openness to international cooperation in the Arctic.

[states]{.mark} [signaled]{.mark} to their nation-state peers that [the

[When questioned on]{.underline} the USCG's [**[meaningful]{.mark}**

17 [[policies were]{.mark} generally [inclusive]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[to **Alaska Native**]{.mark} **[viewpoints]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
However, [[two key principles emerged]{.underline}]{.mark} from the

**collaboration** [were to be]{.mark} **truly
[meaningful]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[including]{.mark} the use of

influence]{.mark} **[needn't monopolize policy
outcomes]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[but **should be
evident**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Second, interviewees agreed that the
USCG and other [[federal agencies were obligated to recognize]{.mark}
the [sovereign status]{.mark},]{.underline} [[self-governance]{.mark},
and unique culture of Alaska's native peoples]{.underline}. They
stressed that meaningful collaboration meant that Alaska Natives were
not considered ordinary stakeholders. Responses from ANO leaders
included statements like these:

> "Meaningful collaboration doesn't necessarily mean you get what you
> want, but that there is some sort of negotiation process. Some give
> and take. It's more than just listening to our perspectives."
>
> "Commercial fishermen are not governments. They are ordinary
> stakeholders."
>
> "Alaska Natives want to be in a true partnership. We want to be at the
> table, not the government here and us over here. Government can learn
> from communities how to make better decisions."

These [[respondents stressed]{.underline}]{.mark} that
**[[several]{.mark} operational [conditions]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[were **essential**]{.underline}]{.mark} [for Alaska Natives'
support]{.underline} for the USGC's collaborative measures.
[First]{.underline}, [[**agencies** must
**respect**]{.underline}]{.mark} [Alaska **[Native
perspectives]{.mark}**]{.underline} and subsistence and be aware of
subsistence calendars. [Second]{.underline}, [[collaboration
must]{.mark} be [accompani]{.mark}ed by **[accountability
mechanisms]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [something some]{.underline} [ANO
leaders [found missing]{.mark}]{.underline} [[in]{.mark} **[federal

[**[consultation]{.mark}** and collaboration [should be **situated**
**locally**]{.mark}]{.underline}, in communities, or regional hubs,
directly involving individuals and tribal elders endowed with
traditional knowledge. [Fourth]{.underline}, [**consultation** must be
**grounded**]{.underline} [in]{.underline} relationships and
**[face-to-face interactions]{.underline}** [to facilitate **trust
building.**]{.underline} Community members, and particularly elders,

The Crown has a duty to consult Aboriginal peoples when it has either

In this context, [[Bolivia]{.mark} began to
[implement]{.mark}]{.underline} [prior]{.underline} [[consultation]{.underline}]{.mark} [processes]{.underline} [[with]{.mark}
[indigenous]{.mark}]{.underline} and
peasant [[communities]{.underline}]{.mark} in
2007. [It]{.underline} thereby [assumed a [pioneering]{.mark} role in
[Latin America]{.mark},
[where]{.mark}]{.underline}[ [the]{.underline} [great]{.underline} [majority
of states]{.underline}]{.mark} --- with the exception of Colombia and
Peru --- [[have not complied with]{.underline}]{.mark} their legal
obligation to fulfil [[indigenous peoples' right to prior consultation
and to]{.underline} **[free, prior and informed consent
(FPIC).]{.underline}**]{.mark} The organization of state-led prior
consultation processes had been a long-standing demand of Bolivia\'s
indigenous lowland peoples, who previously negotiated directly with
transnational corporations (Anthias, 2012; Hindery, 2013). [The
widespread expectation was that, by undertaking a mediating role in the
relations between the indigenous peoples affected by resource extraction
and the interested corporations, the state could help uphold indigenous
and environmental rights and counterbalance the enormous power
asymmetries that exist between the corporations and the
communities.]{.underline}

However, [during fieldwork in local settings, the authors of this
article have been]{.underline} [[confronted with
the]{.underline} **[severe negative social consequences of prior
consultation]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[and]{.mark} company-led
[negotiations]{.mark} over compensation]{.underline} for local
populations such as the Guaraní in Bolivia\'s Chaco area. Looking more
deeply into the lives of community members and participating in the
assemblies of indigenous organizations, it becomes [clear]{.mark}
[that]{.mark} [what [local]{.mark} actors refer to as pasivos
sociales]{.underline} **[([social impacts) from extraction projects
cannot be overlooked]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Among the many negative
social impacts, [our [study]{.mark} [revealed]{.mark} [divisions]{.mark}
[within]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [between]{.mark} [communities]{.mark}; the
[weakening of indigenous organizations]{.mark}; [increased
distrust]{.mark} on the part of the constituency vis-à-vis indigenous
authorities; [and]{.mark} the [exacerbation of local
conflicts.]{.mark}]{.underline} Nelly Romero, an experienced and
well-respected indigenous leader, emphasized during a meeting of the
national Assembly of Guaraní People (APG) that the most severe impacts
that the Guaraní have suffered from the hydrocarbon industry have been
the social ones (field notes, Camiri, 25 November 2014). While this
phenomenon has received little attention in previous scholarly
literature, we consider it to be of utmost importance. In the long
run, [**[fragmented organizations will have a diminished capacity to
defend their claims]{.mark}**, to organize collective action and,
ultimately, to uphold their rights]{.underline} (see Bebbington et al.,
2008; O\'Faircheallaigh, 2008; Sawyer, 2004). The ethnographic methods
we have applied in our study allow us to shed light on the
micro-dynamics at play, including the concrete interactions between
diverse actors. Hence, the questions that interest us here are the
following: [in what ways have indigenous communities and organizations
been adversely affected, socioculturally and sociopolitically, by
consultation and compensation practices? How are local divisions and
conflicts exacerbated by state-led consultations and company-led
negotiations over compensation?]{.underline}

Previous [[research]{.mark} into consultation practices]{.underline} in
Bolivia [has [discussed]{.mark} its [various]{.mark}
[shortcomings]{.mark}: the]{.underline} [**contested interpretation of
consultation and consent rights**,]{.underline} [which **[has made it
difficult to]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[put these rights into
[practice]{.mark}]{.underline}**; the [**[large power
asymmetries]{.mark}** that have shaped these processes to the
disadvantage of local populations; the **[biased and incomplete
info]{.mark}rmation** that has been disseminated; [and]{.mark} the
participants' **[lack of influence]{.mark} [on]{.mark} the design and
execution of extraction [projects]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Bascopé
Sanjínes, 2010; Flemmer and Schilling-Vacaflor, 2016; Fontana and
Grugel, 2016; Haarstad, 2014; Humphreys Bebbington, 2012). Embedded in
their broader analyses, a few articles have also argued
that **[[consultation processes and the related compensation payments
have exacerbated local conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Humphreys
Bebbington, 2012; Pellegrini and Ribera Arismendi, 2012;
Schilling-Vacaflor, 2014). In this article we draw on this previous
research but also aim to extend it in three respects. First, we
disentangle and analyse in fine-grained detail the specific practices
and mechanisms related to consultation and compensation practices ---
meant to empower indigenous peoples and protect their rights --- which
have led to negative social consequences for local populations. As part
of this analysis, we also briefly illustrate the Guaraní strategies
employed to counteract divisive practices and to maintain unity. Second,
we discuss the existing literature on the divisive practices fostered by
transnational extraction corporations in neoliberal regimes (Bell, 2014;
Guzmán-Gallegos, 2012; Hindery, 2013; Sawyer, 2004; Warnaars, 2013;
Watts, 2013) and explain how and why similar mechanisms have been at
work in plurinational and neo-extractivist Bolivia. Hence, we not only
scrutinize the interactions between companies and local populations, but
also analyse the important role that the state has played within these
encounters. Third, we discuss how the processes analysed have been
shaped by and are in turn transforming sociocultural patterns within the
indigenous Guaraní communities involved in our study. To do this, we
embed our findings in the broader ethnohistorical context of Bolivia\'s
Guaraní people. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of our
study with regard to collective rights, indigenous politics and natural
resource extraction.

#### We are increasing outreach now

**Kershaw 13** (Jessica Kershaw, "Interagency Working Group Calls for
Integrated Management and Planning for a Rapidly Changing Arctic",
04/04/2013,
https://www.doi.gov/pmb/ocean/managing-future-rapidly-changing-arctic)

This report chronicles how [[Arctic]{.mark} [residents]{.mark} are
[dealing]{.mark} [with]{.mark} [rapid]{.mark}, [climate]{.mark}
change-[induced impacts]{.mark} [on]{.mark} their [resources and
traditional ways of life]{.mark} at the same time that [new economic
activity]{.mark} and [opportunities]{.mark} are [emerging]{.mark} ---
notably oil and gas, marine transportation, tourism and mining," said
Hayes, chair of the Alaska Interagency Working Group that commissioned
the report. "[It is imperative]{.mark} that we [reduce]{.mark}
[redundancies]{.mark} and [streamline federal efforts]{.mark}
[as]{.mark} [we]{.mark} safely and responsibly [explore and develop
Alaska's]{.mark} vast [resources]{.mark} [while]{.mark}
[preserving]{.mark} the [region's]{.mark} rich [ecosystems]{.mark} that
will sustain future generations."]{.underline} The report --- Managing
for the Future in a Rapidly Changing Arctic --- is based on input from a
wide range of Alaska stakeholders. In addition to recommending
integrated management, the report recommends continuing high-level
attention on the Arctic, strengthening state and tribal partnerships,
encouraging more stakeholder engagement, undertaking more organized and
inclusive scenario planning, and coordinating and potentially
consolidating environmental reviews that are now being prepared by
multiple agencies. The report does not recommend new regulations or
represent new policy decisions, but it does call for a review of the
activities of over 20 federal agencies involved in the U.S. Arctic by
the end of 2013 with an eye toward increased coordination and the
elimination of duplication of efforts. Congress has entrusted the
federal government with primary jurisdiction over nearly three quarters
of the U.S. Arctic\'s land mass. In addition, the federal government has
a special relationship with Alaska natives, including Alaskan tribes and
native corporations The report to the President was led by the
Interagency Working Group on Coordination of Domestic Energy Development
and Permitting in Alaska, with active consultation and assistance from
the National Ocean Council and the Arctic Research Commission.
Established by Executive Order 13580, the Interagency Working Group on
Coordination of Domestic Energy Development and Permitting in Alaska
includes 11 federal departments, agencies and executive offices. The
report also includes the launch of a new government web site, the Arctic
Science Portal, by the Arctic Research Commission, which is chaired by
former Alaskan Lieutenant Governor Fran Ulmer. This web portal will
provide decision makers and other interested parties with easier access
to scientific information about the Arctic. It includes information on
topics such as sea ice, fisheries, oil spill research and many others.
It can be accessed at http://www.arctic.gov/portal/. "This report to the
President emphasizes the importance of using a science-driven,
stakeholder-informed framework---one that takes into account the needs
of functioning ecosystems---for making good decisions in the Arctic,"
said John P. Holdren, President Obama's science and technology advisor
and Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy,
speaking on behalf of the National Ocean Council, which contributed to
the report's creation. "We must redouble our efforts to move forward on
this path." "We are pleased to launch the Arctic Science Portal to help
make science more accessible to decision makers and the general public,"
said Fran Ulmer, Chair of Arctic Research Commission. "The report
released today is extraordinarily important. It emphasizes the key role
that science must play in making good decisions in the Arctic, and seeks
to build on---and expand the successes achieved by the Interagency
Working Group in coordinating across federal agencies, with all key
stakeholders, and with the science community." The authors of the report
engaged in discussions with many agencies and stakeholders in the Arctic
to determine how the federal government might improve management
processes and practices, reporting that diverse parties "agreed that
management decisions in the U.S Arctic should seek to foster healthy
economies, promote thriving cultures, and ensure sustainable
ecosystems---an encouraging consensus." "Based on input from a wide
range of stakeholders, this report shows how applying integrated Arctic
management principles can help us make well-informed decisions in the
Arctic," said Hayes. "[[The key is taking]{.mark} [a]{.mark}
[holistic]{.mark} [approach]{.mark} and [putting a premium on
interagency coordination]{.mark}, [the tradi]{.mark}tional
[knowledge]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [Native]{.mark} [communities]{.mark}, and
[having]{.mark} a fuller [understanding]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[landscape-level sensitivities and impacts.]{.mark} Because Congress has
given the federal government such a major role in the U.S. Arctic, [we
have a responsibility]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [improve]{.mark} our
[coordination]{.mark}, [planning]{.mark}, and [outreach]{.mark} [as we
partner with]{.mark} the State of Alaska municipalities, tribes, [Native
corporations]{.mark}, and other parties that have a stake in the
region."]{.underline}

### 2AC\-\--Consultation Bad

#### Tribes do not want to work with the USFG, consults are too overbearing for them.

College of Law at Arizona State University and in the Rosette LLP
American Indian Economic Development Program. Miller is a citizen of the

Tribal governments and communities are pleased when the United States
respects their rights, interests, and sovereignty, and when they are
able to participate in making decisions about projects and actions that
might impact their interests.146 But [[tribal governments]{.mark}
[have]{.mark} many [concerns about]{.mark} current [federal]{.mark}
[consultation efforts]{.mark}, and would no doubt [argue]{.mark}
that]{.underline} [[best practices]{.mark} are **[rarely]{.mark} [used
in federal consultations]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Ironically, [federal
efforts]{.mark} to date might be **[[both "too much" and "too
little.]{.mark}"]{.underline}**

[The]{.underline} [consultations might be ["too much" because]{.mark}
there are myriad [federal agencies]{.mark} that are [all clamoring
for]{.mark} tribal governments to [consult]{.mark} **[on every subject
under the sun]{.mark}**. Tribal]{.underline} [governments have been
[inundated]{.mark}
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} [consultation]{.underline} [[requests]{.underline}]{.mark} [in
recent decades.]{.underline} 147 The presidential executive orders and
memoranda have created a cottage industry in tribal consultations.
But [[most Indian]{.underline} [governments **do not have sufficient
numbers** of employees]{.underline} [or government
officials]{.underline}]{.mark}[, **[and]{.mark}/or the
[funding]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} effectively]{.underline} [study and plan,
travel, and
fully]{.underline} [[engage]{.underline}]{.mark} [[in]{.mark} all these
[consultations]{.mark}]{.underline}. 148 Consequently, the National
Congress of American Indians, the preeminent national tribal
organization, suggested in 2006 that the federal government should
distinguish between major federal actions of national importance that
require major and prolonged consultations versus actions of minor
importance.149

More importantly, the federal [[consultations]{.mark}
are]{.underline} [also ["too little"]{.mark}]{.underline} in that many
tribes and [[Indians]{.mark} [see]{.mark} [them]{.mark}
[as]{.mark}]{.underline} [almost
**[meaningless]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and that]{.underline} **[[tribal
input produces]{.mark} so [few]{.mark} and
such [minor]{.mark} [concrete]{.mark} [results]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**as
[not]{.mark} to be [worth]{.mark} the [time]{.mark}, [effort]{.mark},
and [money]{.mark}** tribes and individual Indians are
expending]{.underline}.150 The lack of a consent requirement, actual
consent by a tribe before federal agencies can proceed, is one of the
main sticking points. In addition, the UN Declaration and free, prior
and informed consent have raised the bar and the expectations for Indian
nations about consulting with the federal government.

#### Indigenous peoples [resist]{.underline} consultation.

Consult**."** Found using scholar.google.com.

Until recently, [[conflicts between Indigenous peoples and]{.mark} the
[Canadian state over land development projects]{.mark} have proceeded
[without]{.mark} the [requirement]{.mark} that the [state or companies
obtain]{.mark} Indigenous [consent]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 2018, this
changed when the Government of Canada released a statement identifying
'free, prior, and informed consent' ([fpic]{.mark}) as a requirement of
meaningful engagement on projects that implicate Indigenous rights. This
article considers the promise of consent within consultation processes.
Consent is better than its absence, but conflicts over land development
often involve rival claims to authority. [The [principle of consent
cannot]{.mark} alone [address the challenges posed by]{.mark} these
[rival claims nor offer appropriate responses]{.mark} to them. [Through
organised resistance]{.mark}, communities develop collective agency,
forge political alliances, and re-appropriate their authority over
territory and resources that are significant to them. The [introduction
of fpic ]{.mark}clarifies but [does not replace the benefits of
resistance for some communities]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Resistance from Indigenous peoples and governments and companies [ruin consultation]{.underline}.

A second reason to question the relation between consent and organized
resistance is because of the potential for resistance campaigns to
undermine dialogical processes of conflict resolution. Many Indigenous
rights advocates consider undrip and fpic to be significant
accomplishments because they provide productive sites at which
Indigenous peoples can shift the norms of engagement with states and
companies in a direction they desire. [At the same time, some
[governments and companies]{.mark} are [hostile to Indigenous
authority]{.mark} and reluctant to endorse and implement fpic principles
in good faith.39 Ad- herence to fpic may never be fully satisfactory and
this fact alone preserves some conceptual and practical space for other
modes of agency such as or- ganised resistance. Yet, at the same time,
the concern is that organised resis- tance may jeopardise and discourage
a more robust adherence to the fpic framework by state and industry
actors who are already reluctant to apply it.]{.underline} Indigenous
refusal to cooperate can disincentivise the fuller development of
consent-based dialogue. For those who support fpic, the trade-off is too
great[. [Resistance may]{.mark} sometimes [jeopardise
consultation]{.mark} processes.]{.underline} Yet, even a successful
implementation of fpic does not replace the benefits for some Indigenous
communities of engaging in organised resistance. A third reason to
explore the relation between resistance and consultation is that, for
some communities, [[resistance is a]{.mark}n especially effective [means
of]{.mark} asserting [legal and political authority]{.mark} and a means
of enacting jurisdictional authority [where]{.mark}as [consent
is]{.mark} relatively [weak]{.mark}]{.underline} in these respects. For
instance, Audra Simpson ar- gues that Indigenous protest is a form of
refusal to partake in relations on the terms offered by the state.40
[[Through refusal]{.mark}, a [community asserts its authority to]{.mark}
re-centre dialogue on Indigenous perspectives and [shift norms of
engage- ment]{.mark} to stop a particular path-dependency or to
challenge the complacency of other parties to a conflict. Consultation
distorted by colonial relations may, at best, offer Indigenous
communities the opportunity to consent to the terms of their own
dispossession whereas [protest, resistance and refusal]{.mark} can
[advance different terms of engagement]{.mark} and incorporate a
different set of premises.]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--IR K

#### Strengthened IR is bad -- negativity bias happening now

**Dominic '19** Johnson, Dominic D.P., and Dominic Tierney. "Bad World:
The Negativity Bias in International Politics." *International
Security*, vol. 43, no. 3, Feb. 2019, pp. 96--140,
https://doi.org/10.1162/isec_a_00336.

[A major puzzle [in international relations]{.mark} is why [states
privilege negative over positive info]{.mark}rmation]{.underline}.
[[States]{.mark} tend to [inflate threats]{.mark},]{.underline} exhibit
loss aversion, and learn more from failures than from successes.
[Rationalist accounts fail to explain this phenomenon, because
systematically [overweighting bad over good]{.mark} may in fact
[undermine state interests]{.mark}. New research in psychology, however,
offers an explanation]{.underline}. The "[negativity bias]{.underline}"
has emerged as a fundamental principle of the human mind, in which
people\'s response to positive and negative information is asymmetric.
Put simply, bad is stronger than good. [Scholars have long pointed to
the role of negative biases, such as overconfidence, in [caus]{.mark}ing
[war]{.mark}, but negative biases are actually more pervasive
[and]{.mark} may [represent a core explanation]{.mark} [for]{.mark}
patterns of [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}. Positive and negative
dispositions apply in different contexts. People privilege negative
information about the external environment and other actors, but
positive information about themselves. The coexistence of biases can
increase the potential for conflict. Decisionmakers simultaneously
exaggerate the severity of threats and exhibit overconfidence about
their capacity to deal with them. Overall, the negativity bias is a
potent force in human judgment and decisionmaking, with important
implications for international relations theory and practice.

#### Countries are divided by class and ethnics -- the alternative is to break away from social divisions and slow growth

**WB '25** "Open Knowledge Repository." *Worldbank.org*, 2025,

Social cohesion - that is, [[the inclusiveness of a
country\'s]{.underline} [communities]{.underline}]{.mark} [- [is]{.mark}
[essential for generating the trust needed to implement
reforms]{.mark}]{.underline}. Citizens have to trust that the short-term
losses that inevitably arise from reform, will be more than offset by
long-term gains. [[However]{.mark}, in [countries divided]{.mark} along
class and ethnic lines, and [with weak institutions]{.mark}, even the
boldest, most civic-minded and well-informed politician (or interest
group) will [face]{.mark} [severe constraints]{.mark} in [bringing about
policy reform]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The authors hypothesize that key
development outcomes (particularly economic growth) are most likely to
be associated with countries that are both socially cohesive and
governed by effective public institutions]{.underline}. They test this
hypothesis for the sample of countries with available data. The authors
develop a conceptual framework based on the idea of social cohesion,
then review the evidence on which it is based. While several earlier
studies have shown that [[differences in growth rates]{.mark} among
developing countries [are]{.mark} a [result]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[weak]{.mark} rule of [law]{.mark}, lack of [democracy]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} other [institutional deficiencies]{.mark}, the authors
focus on the social conditions that give rise to these deficiencies.
They also seek to [establish]{.mark} empirically [a]{.mark} causal
[sequence from social divisions to weak institutions to slow
growth]{.mark}. The essence of their argument, supported by new
econometric evidence, is that pro-development policies are comparatively
rare in the developing world less because of [the moral fiber of
politicians]{.mark} (though that surely matters) than because good
politicians typically lack the room for maneuver needed to make desired
reforms]{.underline}. [This lack of maneuverability is a
[produc]{.mark}t of [insufficient social cohesion and weak
institutions]{.mark}.]{.underline} The authors also explore the
determinants of social cohesion, focusing on historical accidents,
initial conditions, and natural resource endowments. [[Social cohesion
should not be seen as a concern primarily of developing and transition
economies]{.underline}]{.mark}. Indeed, it is important in the United
Kingdom as in Ukraine, in Canada as in Colombia, in the Netherlands as
in Australia.

### 1NC\-\--Native Climate Adaptation Fails

#### Efforts to relocate Indigenous peoples haven't and will not work

**Schwing 25'** -Indigenous News Reporter "There are lessons to be

https://www.kyuk.org/public-safety/2025-06-11/there-are-lessons-to-be-learned-from-what-went-wrong-with-newtoks-relocation?

[[It took]{.mark} nearly [40 years]{.mark} [for]{.mark} the village of
[Newtok to relocate]{.mark} to a new site]{.underline}, Mertarvik. [[But
the climate-driven relocation]{.underline} [hasn\'t gone entirely to
plan]{.underline}]{.mark}. Here\'s how one of the United States\' first
climate relocations is falling apart. [[Facing]{.underline}]{.mark}
[high rates of [erosion]{.mark} along the banks of the Ninglick River
[and severe impacts of deteriorating permafrost]{.mark}]{.underline},
[people who call [Newtok]{.mark} home [have been forced to move]{.mark}.
The last of the village's residents left in November 2024. [There are
lots of reasons why it's]{.mark}]{.underline} [[taken four decades to
move Newtok]{.mark} to the new village of Mertarvik]{.underline}.
Piecemeal [[federal funding, inadequate planning from outside agencies,
and internal political conflict within the tribal
council]{.underline}]{.mark} are a few. [[Newtok's
relocation]{.underline} [was supposed to provide a model for dozens of
Alaskan communities that will need to move in the coming
decades]{.underline}. [But]{.underline}]{.mark} [for experts, including
Schaeffer]{.underline}, [[it's become a cautionary tale
instead]{.underline}]{.mark}. "You know, Newtok, [[it was a long
process]{.mark} and patchwork of funding, and it [did not flow
well]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} we are [going to deal with unhealthy outcomes
because of that]{.mark}," Schaeffer sa]{.underline}id. "So how do we
learn from that and better prepare decision making that is timed
appropriately so that it doesn\'t have a stop and go process, it has a
better flow?" [Whether it's deteriorating permafrost, riverbank erosion,
or land subsidence]{.underline}, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said
that [[dozens of remote communities in Alaska are dealing with what
Newtok has dealt with for four decades, but those villages don't have
another 40 years.]{.underline}]{.mark}

As I watch the PowerPoint slides pass from one to the next, I forget for
a moment that we are in one of the most violent corners of the world.
[The person speaking is a leader of the Embera-Katío, an indigenous
people from northern Colombia, who tells us of a succession of tragedies
that now threaten to render his people **extinct**.]{.underline} "[[The
State and]{.mark} the [multinational companies]{.mark} seek to
[exploit]{.mark} **natural [resources]{.mark}** [in indigenous
territories]{.mark},"]{.underline} he says, as a map of Colombia's
indigenous reservations flickers on the run-down school's only
blackboard. "And what we Embera have is water." With a click, the map of
the Urrá dam appears. [[The dam was constructed]{.mark} in the early
1990s, [against the indigenous people's will]{.mark}, amid the jungle's
web of rivers that brought us to this place. "[Before]{.mark} Urrá, [the
Embera people lived off of fishing and hunting,but now]{.mark}, with our
[**territory flooded** and]{.mark} the **[rivers]{.mark}' courses
[altered]{.mark}**, [we]{.mark} have to [travel three hours]{.mark} by
motorboat [to]{.mark} the closest town to [buy]{.mark} sources of
[protein]{.mark}. And [we can't hunt because]{.mark} the [guerrillas
covered the mountain with landmines]{.mark}."]{.underline}

The [[guerrillas]{.mark} he refers to [are the]{.mark} Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia ([FARC]{.mark}), the oldest guerilla group in
the world. [They]{.mark} prowl the reservation and [terrorize the Embera
while they fight]{.mark} with [the]{.mark} Colombian
[army]{.mark}]{.underline} over territory and compete with right-wing,
paramilitary groups over narcotrafficking business. [The paramilitary
[groups have]{.mark} also [been sowing **death and destruction**]{.mark}
in the region [for]{.mark} the past [fifteen years]{.mark}]{.underline}.
In fact, we are only five hours (three by boat and two by car) from
Tierralta, one of the paramilitary world capitals, in the Córdoba
province. Since the late 1980s, Tierralta has served as the headquarters
for the counteroffensive that was launched by landowners,
narcotraffickers, politicians, and [sectors of the [army]{.mark} to
drive out the guerillas]{.underline} and gain control of the fertile
land, water, minerals, and coca crops. To achieve this goal[, they
[deemed it necessary to]{.mark} **forcefully [displace]{.mark}** [over
30,000 people]{.mark} from Tierralta,1 [perpetrate twenty-two
massacres]{.mark} in Córdoba,2 [and kill hundreds of people]{.mark}.
[Among those killed were]{.mark} at least [nine indigenous leaders who
opposed the]{.mark} Urrá [dam]{.mark}]{.underline},3 which represented
the type of economic development that was vigorously supported by the
paramilitaries.4 Thus, with the next click, the face of Kimy Pernía
appears[[. In 2001, paramilitaries assassinated]{.mark} Pernía, [the
leader of the Embera resistance]{.mark} against the dam]{.underline}.5
