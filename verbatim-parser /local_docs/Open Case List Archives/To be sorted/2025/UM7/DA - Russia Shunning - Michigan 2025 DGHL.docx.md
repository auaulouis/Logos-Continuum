# DA -- Russia Shunning -- DGHL

### Notes

This disadvantage argues that it is unethical for the United States to
work with Russia because of their ongoing hostility towards the
international (and moral) order. You can pull realism and
consequentialism cards from the various other files to supplement the
aff section.

Thank you to Vikrant, Ethan, Grover, and Gerald for their work on this

#### It's [immoral]{.underline} to work with Russia in the Arctic\-\--ongoing aggression against Ukraine makes isolation the only option. 

Stefan **Kirchner 22**, Research Professor of Arctic Law and Head of the
Arctic Governance Research Group in the Arctic Centre at the University
of Lapland, "Nordic Plus: International Cooperation in the Arctic enters
a New Era," The Polar Connection, 03-06-2022, accessed 07-15-2025,

[Russia is waging an **illegal war of aggression against
Ukraine**]{.underline}. Since 24 February 2022, [this armed
conflict]{.underline}, which has been ongoing since 2014, [has been
escalated dramatically. **Russian forces attack civilians**]{.underline}
across Ukraine and [there have been reports of war crimes and even acts
that, depending on the circumstances]{.underline} and the intent of the
perpetrator, [can be considered **acts of genocide by
Russia**]{.underline}, including the murder of children, systematic
rapes, denial of medical services to the civilian population in occupied
areas, and, with 1.3 million Ukrainians fleeing, also the possibility of
ethnic cleansing. Russia has attacked several nuclear power plants and
created threats to all of Europe.

[This has led to a swift response]{.underline}, not only by the
International Criminal Court which has opened an investigation, but [by
the international community]{.underline}, at least on paper. After the
failure of the United Nations Security Council to condemn the actions by
one of its permanent members that holds veto power, the United Nations
General Assembly adopted a resolution condemning Russia's aggression
with 141 against 5 votes, with key countries, such as China and India,
abstaining. The [aggression unleashed by Vladimir Putin has consequences
for international **coop**eration in the Arctic]{.underline}. In the
following paragraphs, it will be shown that [Arctic
cooperation]{.underline} will continue, but that it [is **already
changing**]{.underline}. International Arctic governance is not dead,
but some of the institutions that have been crucial for it in the past
three decades, such as the Arctic Council, are at the very least
dormant, if not moribund.

I do not claim to be neutral. A native of West Germany, I grew up just a
few kilometres west of the Iron Curtain. For almost a decade, I have
worked in different academic functions in Finland, a country that gained
independence from Russia a bit more than a century ago and that shares a
long border with the world's largest country. As a European patriot, the
fall of the Iron Curtain that enabled the unification of Europe will
always remain a pivotal moment in my life. 24 February 2022 will mark
the end of an era, not only with regard to the governance of the Arctic,
but also personally.

For several years, I have been a visiting professor at V. N. Karazin
University in Kharkiv, teaching in a university building at Freedom
Square in the heart of the city. A few years earlier, I had the pleasure
to teach a short intensive course on the European Convention on Human
Rights at the International Relations Institute of Taras Shevchenko
University, located around the corner from Babin Yar and the TV tower in
Kyiv. As I am writing these lines, which only reflect my private
opinion, geographically far from Ukraine on the sunny morning of
Saturday, 5 March 2022, my colleagues, friends, and their loved ones are
defending their country, hiding in basements or are attempting to flee,
or are already far away from home, fearing that they will never see
their parents, relatives, and hometowns again. I do not know how many of
my former students are alive. The story of the war in Ukraine is theirs
to tell. This text is about the impact of the war on a region that has
been envisaged by one of Mr Putin's predecessors, Mikhail Gorbachev, as
"a zone of peace", the Arctic. The phrase dates back to a speech Mr
Gorbachev gave in Murmansk on 1 October 1987. Today, it seems likely
that 1 October 1987 and 24 February 2022 will mark the beginning and the
end of an era in the international governance of the Arctic.

Birth, Life and Coma of the Arctic Council

But [international Arctic governance did not begin with the Arctic
Council]{.underline}. Also due to the particular challenges that life in
the North brings across the Arctic, cross-border cooperation has long
been the norm in the Arctic. This can be seen for example in the 1973
Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears or in the recuse of whales
that were trapped in the ice off the coast of Alaska by Soviet
icebreakers in 1988, just over a year after Gorbachev's speech.
Environmental concerns were at the starting point for international
cooperation in the Arctic, leading to the Arctic Environmental
Protection Strategy (AEPS) that was created in 1989 in Rovaniemi and
which provided the starting point for the Rovaniemi Process which
eventually led to the establishment of the Arctic Council in 1996.
Through six working groups, the Arctic Council uses scientific research
and cooperation to address key concerns for the entire Arctic, in
particular in relation to the natural environment, but also regarding
preparation for and responses to disasters, and the sustainable
development of the Arctic regions.

The Arctic States are not alone in these efforts that are meant to
provide practical benefits to the people of the Arctic. The Arctic
Council is particularly noteworthy for the inclusion of indigenous
representative organizations as permanent participants, effectively
eye-to-eye with the member States. In recent years, outside actors,
sought observer status with the Arctic Council. While not including a
formal role in decisions, the coveted observer status was seen as an
indicator that the interests of outside actors, such as the People's
Republic of China, were seen as relevant also by those who speak for the
people who live in the Arctic. Arctic strategies have become common
policy tools and have been used to outline visions for the Arctic. Just
last year, the European Union did so when it published its latest such
policy document. While not an observer de jure, the EU has long been one
of the actors that have expressed a keen concern for the Arctic and its
people, although not always without challenges. For the last three
decades, the Arctic has been a place where debates were possible, where
it was possible to move forward together, despite, at times very
serious, differences on issues not related to the Arctic. The huge
amount of knowledge that has been created thanks to the Arctic Council
and the three international treaties that have been agreed upon by the
eight Arctic States, the A8, are the lasting legacy of the Arctic
Council. On 24 February 2022, this era has come to an end, at least for
the time being.

[The other]{.underline} seven [member states of the Arctic Council are
**clearly opposing Russia**]{.underline}, albeit without taking action
to honour their responsibility to protect (R2P), for example through
humanitarian intervention. These concepts have been discussed by
international lawyers at length, but there seems no intention by the
other states to invoke them against a nuclear power. [If a genocide were
to be committed against the people of Ukraine while the other Arctic
States]{.underline}, all of which are members of the EU or NATO, [stand
by and let it happen, the conclusion]{.underline} that [would be drawn
is that **a military power can get away with anything, as long as it has
nuclear weapons**]{.underline}. [It is hard to imagine]{.underline} that
[this is the message the other Arctic States want to send]{.underline}.

For the time being, in addition to sanctions and some aid to Ukraine,
the A7, [the Arctic States minus Russia]{.underline}, [have reacted by
declaring]{.underline} that [they will not participate in meetings of
the Arctic Council or any]{.underline} of its [sub-organizations under
the Russian Chairmanship]{.underline}. This declaration on 3 March was
followed a day later by the announcement by the Arctic Council that it
would pause all of its meetings. The Arctic Council is effectively
dormant. Whether it will remain in an indefinite hiatus, will cease to
function as a relevant forum or can be reactivated depends entirely on
Mr Putin. At this moment, [as the government of the largest Arctic
nation commits war crimes against the civilian population of a
neighbouring country, **there is no basis for
cooperation**]{.underline}. The [cooperation]{.underline} in the Arctic
Council, and the same is true for other fora in the Arctic, especially
in the Barents region, [became possible]{.underline} at the end of the
Cold War [because trust was being built]{.underline} between the new
partners. [This trust has not merely been eroded but **destroyed
overnight.**]{.underline} This includes not only the member states, but
also observers. China and India, important observer states in the Arctic
Council, failed to condemn the Russian aggression in the aforementioned
vote in a special session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.

Among these partners are not only the member states of the Arctic
Council but also indigenous representative organizations, the permanent
participants. Their reaction to the war has been mixed, too. On 1 March
2022, the Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North
(RAIPON) pledged its support for the decisions of V. V. Putin with
regard to the war, although the short summary on its website is
obviously meant to be less specific. The Saami Council's Russian section
published a statement focusing only on the needs of the population of
the Russian Federation, without as much as mentioning Ukraine. As of 5
March 2022, the website of the Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC), which
also speaks for Inuit in Chukotka, Russia, listed as its most recent
news item the information dated 1 March 2022 that the ICC was accepted
as the first Indigenous Peoples Organization that has been invited to
formally participate as an Observer at the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC). There is no statement on the war, nor on its
impact on the Arctic Council. While the websites of the Aleut
International Association is currently in the process of being
redesigned and that of the Arctic Athabascan Council appears to have not
yet been updated recently, the Gwich'in Council International (GCI)
responded by welcoming the pause in the work of the Arctic Council. GCI
expressed its concerns and desire for peace in Ukraine and included a
demand that Russia withdraws its forces from Ukraine immediately.

These different approaches may be inspired also by concern for
indigenous communities and individuals who live inside the borders of
the Russian Federation, in particular in light of the crackdown on civil
rights that is currently underway. [It can be seen that the war tears
through the Arctic Council and the pause of its activities appears
inevitable, given that the Arctic Council is based on]{.underline} the
idea of [consensus-based decision-making]{.underline}. At the moment,
[there is no sufficient trust]{.underline} between the different members
and permanent participants. Consensus-based decisions appear illusory at
the moment. The Arctic Council has stopped functioning. That the current
situation is described as a "pausing" seems to be based on the hope that
it can be reactivated eventually. It is unclear if and when this will be
the case. At this time, it is impossible to imagine this being the case
as long as Russia is not a free and democratic country that is as much
as peace with its neighbors as is the case for the seven other Arctic
States.

[The reaction of Arctic states and Arctic Council observers to the war
crimes, crimes against humanity and acts that, in light of Putin's
history regarding Grozny and Aleppo, increasingly point towards
genocide]{.underline} (a claim that is not made lightly by international
lawyers out of a fear that the concept is overused and the strength of
legal persuasion is weakened in the context of the worst of
international crimes), [has been **unequivocal**]{.underline}. The A7
countries, along with partners in Europe and around the world, are
imposing severe sanctions against the Russian Federation. Sweden and
Finland also face direct threats from Russia as the governments of both
countries consider closer ties to NATO and even entertain the idea of
membership. On 2 March 2022, Russian aircraft violated Swedish air space
near Gotland while the Swedish and Finnish defense ministers were
meeting on the Swedish island in the Baltic Sea during exercises.

What is more difficult to explain is the attitude exhibited by some
observers in the Arctic Council, for example Germany, that continue to
buy gas from Russia, or the People's Republic of China which continues
to be Russia's most important ally. As of Friday, 4 March 2022, the
European Union imports gas worth 250,000 EUR from the Russian Federation
-- every minute. The price for the cavalier attitude towards Russia at
this time is paid by the people of Ukraine. Within the Arctic Council,
however, the position of the seven Western countries, the A7, is
unanimous. It remains to be seen how the war will affect cross-border
cooperation in other fields, but it seems likely that the cuts will be
similarly severe (although the support for the regime in Moscow in
Europe is not zero, also due to the false information provided by the
Russian Federation). For the time being, contacts are being cut.

Accordingly, with the escalation since 24 February 2022, such
cooperation in the Arctic has come to a halt, and with every crime
committed by Russian forces in Ukraine, a return to the past becomes
less likely anytime soon. The evolution of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic
has led to a new normality, one where masks and testing are a matter of
self-preservation and politeness towards others, even when not legally
required, and 2022 is not a smooth return to the reality of 2019.
Something similar is happening with regard to Arctic governance right
now. [There is a new reality]{.underline}, which is different from the
old reality. It is a reality [that allows for cooperation between Arctic
States, but in a manner that is different from the times
before]{.underline}.

This new reality has emerged quickly: as mentioned, the other seven
member states of the Arctic Council announced that they would no longer
participate in meetings of the Arctic Council that would be held in
Russia on Thursday, 3 March 2022. With Russia holding the rotating
chairmanship of the Arctic Council until 2023, this indicated a pause
until next year. Only one day later, the Arctic Council announced that
it is pausing all of its activities. It is not clear for how long this
pause will last. As Russia appears to descend into the darkness of
dictatorship, it appears possible that the fate of the Arctic Council is
similar to that of the League of Nations -- only that the process that
led to the Arctic Council's end was significantly faster. The enforced
hiatus is a reminder that any organization, be it a formal
intergovernmental organization or a forum like the Arctic Council, is
only as strong as its members allow it to be.

In the case of the Arctic Council, it was enough for one member state to
deviate from the foundational idea that international relations are
based on rules. By renouncing the faith in the rules-based nature of the
international order, the Russian Federation has destroyed the fundament
of trust that is necessary for the cooperation on which everybody in the
Arctic has come to rely to some degree or another. While the other
Arctic states were willing to look away when Russia invaded Ukraine in
2014 and Georgia in 2008, when Grozny was destroyed in 1999, and when
Russian agents committed murders in Britain and Germany, it was now
impossible to do so. [The crimes committed in Ukraine on behalf of the
Russian Federation are **too great and too numerous to
ignore**]{.underline}, and [the decision by Western countries to cut the
ties to Russia was bound to affect **coop**eration in the Arctic Council
as well]{.underline}, although the speed and severity with which the
Arctic Council practically imploded will have surprised many.

#### Moral obligation to shun

Eric H. **Beversluis 89**, Associate Professor of Economics at Aquinas
College, Ph.D. in Philosophy from Northwestern University, "On Shunning
Undesirable Regimes: Ethics and Economic Sanctions," Public Affairs
Quarterly, Vol. 3, No. 2, April 1989, accessed 07-15-2025,
https://www.jstor.org/stable/40435708, DG

We find the answer when we note that there is another \"level\" of moral
duties. When Galtung speaks of \"reinforcing . . . morality,\" he has
identified a duty that goes beyound specific acts of respecting
people\'s rights. The argument goes like this: [There is more involved
in respecting the rights of others than not violating them by one\'s
actions]{.underline}. For [if there is]{.underline} such a thing as [a
moral order, which unites people in a moral community, then **surely one
has a duty**]{.underline} (at least **[prima facie]{.underline}**) not
only to avoid violating the rights of others with one\'s actions but
also **[to support that moral order]{.underline}**.

Consider that [the moral order]{.underline} itself
[contributes]{.underline} significantly [to people\'s rights being
respected]{.underline}. It does so [by encouraging and reinforcing moral
behavior and]{.underline} by [discouraging and sanctioning immoral
behavior]{.underline}. In this moral community people mutually reinforce
each other\'s moral behavior and thus raise the overall level of
morality. [Were this]{.underline} moral order [to
disintegrate]{.underline}, were people to stop reinforcing each other\'s
moral behavior, [there would be much more violation of people\'s
rights]{.underline}. Thus to the extent that behavior affects the moral
order, it indirectly affects people\'s rights. And [this is where
shunning fits in]{.underline}.

[Certain types of behavior constitute a **direct attack on the moral
order**. When the violation of human rights is **flagrant, willful, and
persistent**, the offender is]{.underline}, as it were, [thumbing her
nose at the moral order, **publicly rejecting it as
binding**]{.underline} her behavior. Clearly such behavior, if tolerated
by society, will weaken and perhaps eventually undermine altogether the
moral order. Let us look briefly at those three conditions which turn
immoral behavior into an attack on the moral order.

An immoral action is flagrant if it is \"extremely or deliberately
conspicuous; notorious, shocking.\" Etymologically the word means
\"burning\" or \"blazing.\" The definition of shunning implies therefore
that those [offenses require shunning which are **shameless** or
**indiscreet**, which the person makes no effort to hide and no
good-faith effort to excuse. Such actions]{.underline} \"**[blaze
forth]{.underline}**\" **[as an attack on the moral
order]{.underline}**. But [to merit shunning the action
must]{.underline} also [be willful and persistent. We do not consider
the]{.underline} actions of the \"backslider,\" the weak-willed, the
[one-time offender]{.underline} to be challenges the repeat offender,
the unrepentent sinner, the cold-blooded violator morality whose
behavior demands that others publicly reaffirm the moral order. [When
someone flagrantly, willfully, and repeatedly violates the moral order,
those who believe in the moral order]{.underline}, the members of the
moral community, [must respond in a way that **reaffirms the legitimacy
of that moral order**]{.underline}. How does shunning do this?

First, [by refusing publicly to have to do with such a person one
announces support for the moral order and backs up the announcement with
action. This]{.underline} action [reinforces the commitment to the moral
order]{.underline} both [of the shunner and]{.underline} of the [other
members of the community]{.underline}. (Secretary of State Shultz in
effect made this argument in his call for international sanctions on
Libya in the early days of 1986.)

Further, [shunning may **have a moral effect on the shunned person**,
even if the direct impact is not adequate]{.underline} to change the
immoral behavior. If the shunned person thinks of herself as part of the
moral community, [shunning may]{.underline} well [make
clear]{.underline} to her that [she is]{.underline}, in fact, [removing
herself from that community]{.underline} by the behavior in question.
Thus [shunning may achieve by **moral suasion** what cannot be achieved
by]{.underline} \"[force]{.underline}.\"

Finally, [shunning may be a form of punishment]{.underline}, of moral
sanction, [whose appropriateness **depends not on whether it will change
the person\'s behavior, but on whether he deserves the punishement for
violating the moral order**. Punishment]{.underline} than [can be viewed
as a way of maintaining]{.underline} the moral [order]{.underline}, of
\"purifying the community\" [after it has been made]{.underline}
\"**[unclean]{.underline}**,\" as ancient communities might have put it.

## Impact

### Impact\-\--2NC

#### Default to [dutiful ethics]{.underline}\-\--utilitarianism can't account for moral intuition nor why we feel responsible for the past.

Clifford G. **Christians 7**, Professor of Communications at the
University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Ph.D. in Communications from
the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, "Utilitarianism in Media
Ethics and Its Discontents," Journal of Mass Media Ethics, Vol. 22, No.
2-3, 2007, accessed 07-15-2025,
https://doi.org/10.1080/08900520701315640, DG

[Utilitarian ethics has **major weaknesses**]{.underline}, despite its
democratic appeal. [It depends on assessing the consequences accurately,
when in everyday affairs the results of our choices are **often
unknown**]{.underline}, at least in the long term. Blogging is a
revolution in journalism at present, but how can we calculate all the
changes even a decade from now? The short-term benefits of exposing
corruption in a political campaign may be offset by long-term negative
consequences---public hostility to an overly aggressive press. [The
results are]{.underline} frequently [complicated and
intertwined]{.underline} so that [a theory staking itself on
results]{.underline} often [**does not provide adequate guidelines** for
morally acceptable action]{.underline}.

Among moral philosophers, the most influential critique of
utilitarianism has been developed by W. David Ross.9 Ross argued against
the utilitarian claim that others are morally significant to us only
when our actions impact them pro or con (1930, pp. 17--21).10 We usually
find ourselves confronting more than one moral claim at the same time
in- volving different ethical principles. [Asking only what produces the
most good is too limiting]{.underline}. It does not cover the ordinary
range of human relationships and circumstances. People recognize promise
keeping, equal distribution, nonviolence, and preventing injury as moral
principles. In various situations any of them might be the most
stringent. [Ordinary moral sensitivities suggest]{.underline} that [when
someone]{.underline}

> [fulfills a promise]{.underline} because he thinks he ought to do so,
> it seems clear that [he does so with no thought of its total
> consequences]{.underline}.... [What makes him think it's right to act
> in a certain way is]{.underline} the fact [that he]{.underline} has
> [promised to do so]{.underline}---that and, usually, nothing more.
> (Ross, 1930, p. 17)

[Utilitarianism]{.underline} as a single-consideration theory does not
simply demand that we maximize general happiness, but renders irrelevant
other moral imperatives that conflict with it. As Charles Taylor argued,
the exactness of this one-factor model is appealing, but [represents
only]{.underline} ''**[a semblance of validity]{.underline}**'' [by
leaving out whatever cannot be calculated]{.underline} (Taylor, 1982, p.
143; cf. Bowers, 2002).

In some media situations, consequences are a reliable guide. But in many
of the most crucial issues we face at present, utility is not
adequate---for understanding distributive justice, diversity in popular
culture, violence in television and cinema, truth telling, digital
manipulation, conflict of interest, and so forth. We face the anomaly
that the ethical system most entrenched in the media industry is not
ideally suited for resolving its most persistent headaches.

In an ethics of consequences, ''only the future counts with respect to
what is morally significant, and not the past'' (Dyck, 1977, p. 60).
Future results, even though they are hypothetical, are determinative.
But why should possible benefits in the future count more, for example,
than gratitude to parents for their deeds of the past? If I made a
promise in the past, for instance, this moral duty would be the most
urgent in the present. If my previous acts have harmed someone, I have a
duty of reparation, that is, making up for earlier wrongs. There are
duties of justice that require us to ignore or even upset the balance of
happiness (Ross, 1930, p. 21).

Thus [an ethics of duty is]{.underline} a **[more
compelling]{.underline}** model of moral decision making. [It covers the
entire time frame rather than only]{.underline} anticipating [future
effects. Duty responds to a broader range of human experiences and
relations. Duty recognizes]{.underline} that [the human community
**requires dutiful actions to maintain its humanness**]{.underline}. H.
Richard Niebuhr, in fact, saw responsibility as inherent in our
personhood. Our selfhood is manifest in the action of answering. [Our
relation to other selves carries moral obligation]{.underline}; we
respond to responders; [we live in responsive relations]{.underline}
(1963, pp. 59--61, 152--160). With a similar understanding of humans as
responsible agents, Emmanuel Levinas (1981) insisted that [our duties to
others are **more fundamental** to human identity than are individual
rights]{.underline}.

An ethics of duty provides a critical framework that prevents us from
having our ethical theory and democratic practice slide into one
another. In terms of the overall task of developing a theoretically
credible media ethics, the most promising direction is a deontological
one.

Dialogic Ethics

Claiming that moral acts are duties is to say that [a **dutiful act
itself** fosters an integration of personhood and community. Duty does
not wait until the jury of effects]{.underline} is in, [nor does duty
apply exclusively to virtuous individuals. **Duty does not distinguish
between means and ends**]{.underline}. Duty is incorporated---or acted
out---in specific behaviors or policies by the community. Truth telling
is one such behavior; lies violate human community while empowering the
liar at the expense of the person who is duped.

It should be obvious that a social ethics of duty differs categorically
from Kant's deontological version. Niebuhr argued for the responsible
self as a root metaphor---that is, an expression that opens up our way
of being in the world. The self is dynamic, in his view; [our personhood
is manifest in the action of answering]{.underline}. The responsible
self interacts with the entire spatiotemporal context, but our relation
to other selves is primary. [The self exists in dialogue with
community]{.underline}---the community an organic whole in contrast to
Mill's atomistic aggregate. [Duty is not obedience to formal law, but a
dialogical self seeking]{.underline} through responsive relations a
responsible fit with the total ''circumambience of life'' (Niebuhr,
1963, p. 153).

Arthur Dyck elaborated on the concept of communal duty through an
inflection on W. D. Ross. Such [self-evident obligations]{.underline} as
promise keeping, gratitude, making reparations, beneficence, and justice
[are not merely characteristics of morality]{.underline} that humans
recognize implicitly or explicitly; [they are **required for communities
to exist cooperatively and to flourish**]{.underline}. Dyck referred to
Ross's [prime facie duties as]{.underline} ''**[moral requisites for
community'']{.underline}** (1977, p. 160). In a different inflection
with the same idea, Bernard Gert understood prima facie duties [in terms
of the common morality]{.underline}. Killing, causing pain, breaking
promises, for example, ''everyone counts as immoral'' and ''[no one
seriously doubts'']{.underline} that [such actions need justification or
societies cannot exist]{.underline} (1992, pp. 14--15).11

#### You have a moral obligation to [draw a line]{.underline} in the face of [inevitable extinction]{.underline}.

Maxim 3: **[Have a Line in the Sand]{.underline}**.

Know that **[there are some things you will not do, some modes of living
you will not embrace]{.underline}**. Know that **[there are lives worse
than death. Be prepared to die]{.underline}**.

Basis. This maxim is the core insight behind the practice of formulating
advance directives. [At what point is it time to stop?]{.underline} We
are thinking of hospice patients who asked that their tube feedings be
stopped, and the candidate for a brain surgery to de-bulk a benign tumor
who declined the procedure, because life in the hospital and rehab was
simply unpalatable to him. (Interestingly enough, he lived far longer
than his projected life expectancy had he had the surgery.)

For those of us in health care, there are the sobering lessons from the
horrific situation that developed at Memorial Hospital in New Orleans
after Hurricane Katrina, as recounted in Sheri Fink's outstanding book,
Five Days at Memorial: Life and Death in a Storm-Ravaged Hospital
(2013). As floodwaters rose in the days after the storm, the hospital
lost power when the grid failed, and then lost backup power when their
generators were swamped. With no power, the ventilators and other
life-supporting machines stopped working. There were no functioning
monitors. Without air conditioning, temperatures in the sealed units
rose rapidly. As the days went by, shortages of food and medicine
developed. Gunfire was heard in the streets; police withdrew from the
area because of the danger. Under these conditions, impossible triage
decisions were made, and finally, over a dozen critically ill patients
were injected with lethal doses of morphine and sedatives.

Extrapolation. Post-Katrina New Orleans presents us with the kinds of
[scenarios]{.underline} that [can be expected to be a regular occurrence
as natural and social collapse unfold]{.underline}. Useful reflections
on how to behave in such extreme situations come from the concentration
camp writings of Victor Frankl and Etty Hillesum. There is also the
example of Ludwig Wittgenstein, who urged his student Drury, who was
preparing to go into combat in World War II, to decide ahead of time not
to engage in hand-to-hand combat, but to be willing to be killed instead
(Monk 1990).

[Know what you will do, and what you will not]{.underline}. Max Weber
formulated it this way in his classic lecture "Politics as a Vocation"
(1919):

> it is immensely moving when [a mature man]{.underline}---no matter
> whether old or young in years---[is aware of a responsibility for the
> consequences of his conduct and]{.underline} really [feels such
> responsibility]{.underline} with heart and soul. [He]{.underline} then
> [acts by following an **ethic of responsibility** and]{.underline}
> somewhere he [reaches the point where he says]{.underline}: "Here I
> stand; **[I can do no other]{.underline}**." [That is]{.underline}
> something **[genuinely human and moving]{.underline}**. And every one
> of us who is not spiritually dead must realize the possibility of
> finding himself at some time in that position.

[Considering the **likely realities of collapse and
transition**]{.underline}, it seems probable that [many]{.underline}
people [will find themselves facing these kinds of
decisions]{.underline}, and [something like an internal, ethical
"advance directive" could prove beneficial]{.underline}. This is why,
for example, [emergency responders run through practice
scenarios]{.underline}. The body and the imagination need to be
encouraged to engage directly that which lies outside the normal. True,
drawing lines in sands that are constantly shifting in a tricky
business. One must be prepared, as well, to pivot and go in unexpected
directions. But these [pivots are more likely to be done well if one has
prepared by imagining the worst and **drawing practice lines in the
sand**]{.underline}.

Secondly, will those things of ostensible concern to the future actually
have any significant impact? [Would]{.underline}, for example, [the
world be so different]{.underline} now [if the dodo had not been hunted
to extinction]{.underline}? Would raising the global temperature by a
degree or the sea level by a few inches two thousand years ago have
prevented the Romans from invading Carthage? Would it have prevented the
development of civilisation around the Mediterranean? When put like
that, it seems farfetched. [Even if we let the sea level rise by seventy
metres and the world warm by several degrees]{.underline}, dikes will be
built the same way that land is reclaimed from the sea in the
Netherlands today and, although agricultural practices might change, [it
is **unlikely** we will be completely without food]{.underline}.
MacAskill himself points out that [humanity would **even survive nuclear
winter**]{.underline} (MacAskill 2022, 131). This is not to say that we
should not care about these things: on the contrary, if we are forced to
flee the earth and terraform Mars, then perhaps they will have an
enormous impact. However, [there is]{.underline} certainly [an open
question about the **relative importance** of many things to human
history]{.underline}, and [it has often been the case that **what people
have thought important at one time has proven to be largely unimportant
at a later date**]{.underline}. MacAskill assumes that our present
actions will have significant future effects, but he has done little to
explain why this is the case.

### Impact\-\--Complicity\-\--2NC

#### It causes [complicity]{.underline}.

This point can be taken further. [It is not simply that states need to
avoid condoning the moral behaviour of other states; they also need to
**avoid being complicit** in it]{.underline}. Why is complicity wrong
here? After all, complicity can have several forms, with some forms not
being morally wrong, all things considered (Lepora and Goodin, 2013). My
claim is this: [when states fail to register rebuke of those that engage
in internal or external aggression, they may be **complicit in future
situations of aggression**]{.underline} (**[as well as of the current
situation]{.underline}**). The [complicity may stem from the fact that
their silence can be **reasonably foreseen to be perceived by other
parties**]{.underline}, including the aggressor, [to be an act of
condoning the continuation of the aggression under consideration or of
future aggression of a similar nature]{.underline}.12

[Kantian ethics locates the value of action in its maxim]{.underline} or
principle, [not in its]{.underline} likely or foreseen or actual [causal
impacts]{.underline}. This is easily taken as an ethics of individual
integrity (let the murderer do what he will) or alternatively, and more
plausibly to our ears, as a naïve ethics that may fall into complicity.
28 I have been suggesting that Kant's own discussion is too simple and
betrays deeper insights available on his framework. I now want to
suggest that these insights can make sense of the thought that we find
ourselves unavoidably complicit in climate destabilisation.

The deeper insights begin, I think, with the idea that [action is **more
powerful** than the consequentialist assumes. Action counts for
more]{.underline} than its likely or foreseen or actual effects,
[because when we act well we cooperate]{.underline} with others [to
create and uphold a lived morality. **Abstract ideals are given concrete
form** by]{.underline} our [actual interaction. When we
participate]{.underline} -- as relatively privileged persons, more or
less able to act on our own accounts, active beneficiaries rather than
beggars or drudges or persons living under terror29 -- [we uphold and
support a lived morality]{.underline}. If we are fortunate, that
morality instantiates valuable ideals. As I have been emphasising, it
may also involve grave violations of them.

On this view, the line between individual and collective action is less
firm than it seems to common sense. On an everyday basis, we deliberate
about individual decisions using familiar moral categories. Kant's
notion of a kingdom of ends highlights what we thereby take for granted.
When we see our activity in moral terms,30 we imagine ourselves as
participating with others to impose a normative structure on our
interaction. Kant sometimes invites us to view this structure in terms
of straightforward, universally binding rules -- in the famous
prohibitions on suicide and false promising in the Groundwork, as much
as his essay about lying. Following Schapiro, I have suggested this is
mistaken. To understand what we should do in a given situation, we need
a much richer sense of the modes of (inter)action we are involved in or
might be drawn into. Indeed, [it is **misleading** to focus only on what
to do in a particular situation]{.underline}, since there is a much
broader question at stake: what sorts of lives should we be leading and
what sort of world do those lives contribute to?

Another way of putting the point would be to take Kant's own book
titles, and point out how many steps are involved in moving from
'groundwork' to 'metaphysics' to 'morality' as an actual lived reality.
Here, I have only gestured at the steps needed to build on this
groundwork. But I have wanted to insist on their necessity and their
creative aspects -- the importance of people's actually defining modes
of interaction and cooperation that make morality concrete, that realise
ideals of mutual respect and concern. I have also suggested that these
steps involve a certain loss of innocence. 31 [When we participate with
others and give a concrete form to morality, we are bound to rely on one
another]{.underline}, in all sorts of ways. [We rely on modes of
interaction]{.underline} that [we inherit from those who came before us.
It will always be a matter of cooperation and]{.underline} it [**always
involves compromises**. Sometimes these fall into
complicity]{.underline}.

Schapiro shows that [when others betray basic moral principles,
otherwise **obligatory forms of action can amount to
complicity**]{.underline}. It is easy to see how [this can extend to
institutional contexts]{.underline} -- for instance, when the corruption
of a formerly decent organisation means that fulfilling one's role
becomes questionable or even reprehensible. We can take this a step
further, into the large-scale collective harm cases. For example, what
looks like a reasonable commercial transaction becomes complicity in
factory farming or sweatshop labour. But rather than specific deeds, I
want to emphasise the ways of living ('lifestyles') that we find
ourselves engaged in, since I think it is here that the charge of
complicity really bites. Even after we have made all the choices that
give shape to our individual lives, and even after we have done our best
to avoid or challenge massive injustices like climate destabilisation --
even then, pleas of non-responsibility ring hollow. We still find that
opportunities for participating in social life, our ways of contributing
to society as well as drawing on its benefits, depend on and contribute
to these same injustices. 32 [We sustain ways of interacting that betray
basic moral principles. However unwillingly, we lend them our moral
support]{.underline}.

The other side of Schapiro's argument was that actions that are
otherwise wrong can be subverted -- that is, 'corrupted' in the opposite
direction. As well as defensive deception, we might think of leaking or
whistleblowing, and various forms of disruption or protest or civil
disobedience. As noted, we may have good reason to regret such actions,
and not only the situation we find ourselves in: robbed of social and
institutional support, **[moral action begins to slip from our
grasp]{.underline}**. Although Schapiro does not raise the possibility,
we can well imagine cases where it seems really impossible to find an
acceptable way of acting -- **[all the options look like
not-quite-lesser evils]{.underline}**.

That is the scenario where people lack a functional state or live in a
state where there is systematic injustice. [People find themselves
without a defensible way to relate to one another]{.underline}. In Lucy
Allais' example, wealthier people participate in social systems that
make them the beneficiaries of injustice and leave them no way to do
right by those in grave need. In one sense, it would be outrageous to
describe them as powerless: the truly powerless are those who can only
live or die by beggary. Depending on social and political conditions,
richer people may be able to make charitable contributions or sign
petitions or protest. Indeed, neither dire need nor naked coercion
prevent them from dedicating their whole lives to opposing these wrongs.
Still, even the most single-minded campaigner can only advocate changes:
as a matter of social fact, she lacks the power to impose a new order;
morally, she is obliged to seek others' consent; [conceptually,
**imagination cannot foresee the endless ramifications of any
significant change, however detailed the proposals anyone
makes**]{.underline}. Regardless of individual good will and efforts to
help or compensate or improve systems, then, richer persons continue to
lead lives that effectively reproduce injustice.

The large-scale collective harm examples have the same structure -- with
the further problem that [those who are wronged cannot]{.underline} ([or
can hardly]{.underline}) [speak for themselves]{.underline}. Animals
cannot speak in voices we are willing to hear; the distant poor are
distant and thoroughly disempowered; in the case of climate
destabilisation, those who will suffer the worst injustice have not been
born. Again, we all feel the suspicion that we really are powerless to
change or challenge these systems, corresponding to a perplexity as to
whether anything we might do would really help. In some of the
collective harm cases, such as factory farming or sweatshop labour,
there may be ways of opting out: we are unlikely to make any difference
as individuals, but at least we can vote with our feet and make a stand.
33 In the case of climate destabilisation, I fear that even after our
best attempts to minimise our contributions and to protest, most of us
can neither opt out nor make a difference. 34 In one sense, again, we
are unable to alter our social systems and structures of collective
action. But if we speak of powerlessness, let us also remember the
participation and the privileges, as well as the brute, brutal
powerlessness awaiting those who will simply inherit an unstable,
inhospitable biosphere. Let us remember, too, that **[everyone who acts
politically]{.underline}** (at least, without mass support) **[could
enter the same plea]{.underline}**. However certain a person is that
things must change, she can neither impose that change or be sure that
her initiatives will actually make a difference for the better.

Together, I think these ideas enable us to understand why
[we]{.underline} -- by which I mean: conscientious, concerned citizens
of contemporary Western societies -- [can reasonably make the charge of
complicity]{.underline} in climate destabilisation, levelling it [both
at ourselves and at fellow citizens who prove less conscientious and
concerned. By our participation in society, we may be doing all sorts of
things to maintain and augment the cultural and institutional and moral
stock to be inherited by those who come after us]{.underline}. I use
this odd phrase, 'moral stock', to underline one of the inheritances
that matters most on this account: the creation of ways of acting
together that enact valid principles and uphold worthy ideals, in the
form of customs and organisational structures and political systems.
**[Unless we radically change how we live]{.underline}** together,
**[whatever is worthwhile in this moral stock will be
imperilled]{.underline}**, since we are also passing on a radically
degraded world that spells impoverished, deracinated lives and savage
deaths for billions of people. (We are so used to the word
'unsustainable' that it is hard to hear its implications. 35 ) We find
ourselves participating in -- upholding, reproducing, bequeathing --
ways of organising and living together that are radically unjust, not
least because they are doomed to fail by virtue of sawing off the
branches on which they sit.

No doubt, this view is open to the charge of mere hand-wringing, 36 or
at least of ignoring important questions about responsibilities for
political change. It might also be suspected of exculpating those who
play a more active role in sustaining these systems. While I concede
these dangers, I do not think they undermine the basic point. **[The
charge of complicity marks our situation as intolerable]{.underline}**.
It acknowledges that **[even our best attempts to act in good faith are
not good enough]{.underline}**. This is not to say that 'in the night,
all cats are grey'. All of us must participate in our social systems,
but [there are degrees of power and complicity and support]{.underline}.
So [this account is perfectly compatible with making more emphatic
accusations against some, and **placing pressure on those with greater
powers to intervene**]{.underline}. Indeed, I am sure that it mandates
both. 37 But [to make the charge of widespread, unavoidable complicity
is to insist that we are in the dark, morally speaking]{.underline}.

One might also object, from the other direction as it were, that if our
involvement is really unavoidable, then the charge of complicity is
inapt. 'Ought implies can', say many modern philosophers; 38 if an
individual really cannot avoid participation and really cannot do
anything to change these systems, then he is not blameworthy. My
argument that [we may find ourselves implicated in wrong, regardless of
all good intentions and efforts]{.underline}, rests on a particular
interpretation of Kant's thought. As such, it can hardly allay such
doubts. But perhaps I can offer one further thought by way of reply, as
to whether the concept of 'blameworthiness' is well-formed. Apart from
the intractability of the notion of desert, 39 it leaves open the
questions: what sort of reproach or sanction or response? And by whom?
On my account, [the charge of complicity is primarily one that we must
level against ourselves. It is not about punishing]{.underline}
ourselves or others; it is not about discovering a yellow stain on our
souls; 40 it is not about deciding which element of 'guilt, discomfort,
\[or\] resentment' (Allais) is ultimately appropriate to our situation.
As I noted in introduction, our standard ways of understanding and
dealing with retrospective responsibility prove inadequate here.
Instead, [the charge of complicity marks a self-consciousness about the
injustice of the morality we live by. We face a responsibility that we
cannot take]{.underline}, because we do not know how to. Yet we can
hardly doubt that we ought to. A civilisation that ruins the prospects
of future human habitation has no title to the name.

[By accepting the charge of complicity, we take one step to overcoming
it]{.underline}. As individuals, we may not be able to 'make a
difference' in any sense that registers on the consequentialist scales.
Nonetheless, [we draw on our moral agency]{.underline} -- [the power
that we grant one another when we see human activity as contributing to
morality as a lived reality]{.underline} -- [to **register our
protest**: that we find ourselves in a position where
nothing]{.underline} that most of us can do [counts as good or good
enough]{.underline}. Even if all that is left to us are 'mere words' and
fragmentary gestures and (thus far) barely effectual attempts to
reimagine the social systems we rely on, we still register a willingness
to take responsibility. [We lay a small part of the groundwork for
creating better structures]{.underline}, even though these are bound to
be hard to make out in advance of their realisation amongst us as stable
forms of collective action. [The charge of complicity is not mere
hand-wringing. It is, rather, **a refusal to wash our hands of the
matter**]{.underline}.

### Impact\-\--AT: Consequentialism

#### Consequentialism fails\-\--prefer moral responsibility. 

James **Lenman 25**, Professor of Philosophy at the University of
Sheffield, Ph.D. in Moral Philosophy from the University of St. Andrews,
"Beyond Utilitarianism," in *Should We Maximize Utility? A Debate about
Utilitarianism*, pp. 84-94, Routledge, 2025, accessed 07-11-2025,
http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781003300045-9, DG

A less familiar but very important reason why it is a mistake to see
plausible non-consequentialist ethics as involving an injunction not to
cause harm, or even not to cause death, is that all of us, in the course
of our lives, will certainly cause many deaths. This is just because, as
the Cluelessness Considerations make stark, [we will all]{.underline} of
us [cause an awful lot of stuff]{.underline}, way, way more stuff [than
we can readily foresee]{.underline}.

A consequence of the Cluelessness Considerations is that [it
is]{.underline} quite [**futile** to have a general injunction against
causing harm or death]{.underline}. We can be very sure **[we all
cause]{.underline}** a vast amount of harm and [**a great many deaths**.
The **foreseen consequences** of what we do **are a tiny drop in the
ocean** of the total consequences]{.underline}, and the latter, we can
be utterly certain, will involve an awful lot of bad stuff, including
death, as well as an awful lot of good stuff. [We cause a
death]{.underline}, after all, [whenever we have a child]{.underline},
any child---namely, the death of that child, as well as the deaths of
all its lineage, should it have one, in perpetuity. [But]{.underline}
almost [nobody would think this a reason not to have
children]{.underline}.

I do not have a worked-out rival ethical theory to offer you as an
alternative to utilitarianism, but I have some rough thoughts. The
business of ethics, or at least a crucial, central part of it, whether
or not we are to think of it as theory, is the business of trying to
arrive at an understanding of what I may reasonably expect and demand of
you by way of taking proper account of me and what you in turn may
reasonably expect and demand of me, where a core part of what may be
understood by 'reasonably' is that there be a measure of symmetry, of
reciprocity, between what I may demand of others and others of me.
[Ethics is]{.underline}, crucially and centrally, if not exclusively,
[the business of us trying to arrive together at a shared understanding
of what we owe to each other that we can all]{.underline}, if we are
reasonable, [accept]{.underline}.2 Our trying to do this has involved,
as I noted in Chapter 5, a conversation that has already been going on
for a very long time, leaving us with a shared space of normative
understanding that shapes our moral relations with each other and in the
light of which we stand to be held responsible for our conduct by our
fellows.

So what moral demands may we reasonably make on each other? That is a
question of what we want our moral relations to be like. I use the word
'want' but urge a certain circumspection. The desires we bring to the
table of moral code liberation are always already moralized ideals, not
simply appetites, though intelligent ideals will always give appetite
its due. Well, I guess we should treat each other with kindness and
respect, with recognition that each of us is a factor in the moral
equation. I cannot pursue my aims as if you did not exist. Finding you
in my way, I should walk around and not through you. Sometimes I should
just stop.

We may demand kindness and respect. But [there are things]{.underline}
it seems to me [we cannot reasonably demand of each other]{.underline}.
Here are three.

1\. [**We cannot demand that we do not impose small risks on one
another**. Such a demand would]{.underline} be paralyzing and would
[prohibit us from engaging in]{.underline} all the myriad activities
that constitute [a worthwhile human life]{.underline}.

2\. [We]{.underline} cannot demand of others a concern for our welfare
that demands not just that they give great weight to directing no harm
at us, but that they give no less weight to averting harms that threaten
us by not allowing them to happen. Again, that would involve an
unacceptable level of normative imposition that would unduly confine the
sphere of our autonomy to live as we wish. (Which, of course, is not to
deny the frequent urgency of taking positive actions, as individuals and
as communities, to address the intolerable levels of avoidable suffering
and death that burden many of our fellow human beings, or to endorse
complacency on that score.)

3\. **[We cannot reasonably be expected not to throw the dice of history
by impacting the future]{.underline}** in the way we all will where that
is ordinarily, beyond a certain not very distant point, utterly
inscrutable except for the actuarial certainty that it will be
momentous.

We can find many things to reproach [our forebears]{.underline} with.
Perhaps they have perpetrated great injustices which still cast
difficult shadows over our moral relations with each other today.
Perhaps they have failed in their stewardship of the natural environment
and left us with a poisoned atmosphere and an impoverished biosphere.
But the fact [that]{.underline} by coupling with their spouses, by
moving house, by holding parties, by tentatively opening a conversation
with their attractive classmates, they [are causally connected in ways
they could never have foreseen to **every kind of horror**]{.underline},
war, murder, and genocide, [as well as to countless much nicer things,
is **not** an item **on their moral account book**. It is]{.underline}
simply [**part of the human condition** and **not one**]{.underline}
that [**we can remotely hope to eliminate** that our causal relations to
future history are **devious, deep, and wholly inscrutable** in the ways
that they are]{.underline}. And just for that reason, our descendants
cannot reasonably demand of us that we should try to do so.

[To urge that we should would be]{.underline}, in effect, to embrace a
form of **[species level anti-natalism]{.underline}**: to urge that we
make ourselves extinct because the harm we cause by perpetuating
ourselves into the future is just too much. That may appeal to some
people: there is so much suffering; let's just all call it a day. But
let us for now not detain ourselves by considering that council of
despair and pursue a sensible non-consequentialist approach to ethics
that does not embrace it.

[A sensible non-consequentialist approach will]{.underline} certainly
**[forbid our directing significant harm at other people]{.underline}**.
I have argued a sensible non-consequentialism will enjoin us to act
towards others in ways that are consistent, at least ex ante, with the
aim of protecting them from harm.3 But [a blanket prohibition on causing
harm is clearly not an eligible principle]{.underline}. When I exercise
my agency in quite ordinary ways, I start countess causal chains that
will eventuate somewhere down the line in many people dying.

When we think of a moral landscape where we do not respect or care for
each other, where we view each other as simply things to plunder and
prey upon, our imagination recoils in horror. We don't, any of us, care
to live in such a world. And when we think of a moral community where we
live together peacefully and cooperatively in civic friendship, our
imagination warms to that possibility, and we think it a desirable thing
to which we might sensibly aspire. These aspirations are widely shared
and endorsed and prove highly stable under reflective scrutiny

But [when we think of a world where we set out to live our lives, and
not just give them up, in such a way that we **never stir the pot of
history** and set in train all manner of remote consequences
generations]{.underline}, maybe aeons, hence, [we quickly understand
that that is an **idle fantasy**]{.underline}, like **[a world where we
are made of glass]{.underline}** or where we are each the size of a
large planet, and we simply don't worry ourselves ethically on that
score.

8.2 Strong Longtermism and Existential Risk

[Consequentialists are left]{.underline}, at best, [with the thought
that whatever else we do or do not know about the long-term effects of
our actions, extinction is forever]{.underline}. So human extinction, at
least, we know would be awful because it would, as we already saw,
gravely threaten the possibility that we, or something, have a glorious
future where we, or something, will colonize space and enable lots of
utility to happen for ages and ages. And this is the important thing.
Overwhelmingly the most important thing. And because extinction is
forever, a concern to avert existential risk is distinctively
invulnerable to the Cluelessness Considerations. So we should maybe
adopt an ethics that gives overwhelming priority to addressing
existential risks.4 Consequentialism can at least make good sense of why
that is important.

Other animals, as we noted, will survive. But that will be no comfort
for those people discussed in Chapter 4 who believe the lives of other
animals have no value and the universe would be better off without them.
And although other animals might someday evolve that are as smart and
important as we like to think we are, perhaps even endowed with the
smarts needed to colonize space, we might think the risk too high that
that will not happen in time, or perhaps that the cognitively
sophisticated descendants of monkeys or whales just aren't interested in
doing any of that stuff. (Why ever would they be?)

[I do not]{.underline} myself [think]{.underline} even a [concern to
avoid existential risk is]{.underline} distinctively
[invulnerable]{.underline} to the Cluelessness Considerations. The
breezy way in which [defenders of strong longtermism spin **wildly
speculative science fiction stories** about the fantastically remote
distant future to which they suppose they can assign meaningful values
and probabilities is]{.underline}, I think, **[bewildering in its
epistemic complacency]{.underline}**. But we can put that thought to one
side. For [even if we were to grant that in cases where existential risk
is saliently at issue, cluelessness]{.underline} can be tamed, the
problem remains that it [remains **untamed everywhere
else**]{.underline}.

So were we to grant (which I think we should not) what was just
suggested, we are left with a [consequentialism]{.underline} that [can
make good sense of why it would make poor ethical sense to construct a
doomsday machine and detonate it or to develop a supertransmissible
killer virus]{.underline} and release it in the population. [Which is
always nice to know]{.underline}.

But [what this]{.underline} consequentialism [cannot make sense of is
why it is a good idea to make sure your children have enough to eat,
or]{.underline} why it is a bad idea [to kill your granny]{.underline}
and feed her to some nearby pigs, or why you really shouldn't set out to
burn down your local primary school or to exterminate the Jewish
population of Europe. [In contemplating such things, existential threats
to humanity are **nowhere in sight**, just a vast **future of endlessly
ramifying consequences** which we remain utterly clueless how to
compute, estimate, and compare. Consequentialism, whatever it says about
existential risk,]{.underline} certainly **[says nothing at all about
such things]{.underline}** as these. Success that is limited is not
success at all.

8.3 Concluding Remarks

The Aristotelian idea that **[virtue lies in a mean between
extremes]{.underline}** works better in some contexts than in others. I
rather think something like it may apply here. There are two opposing
mistakes to be made. On the one hand, you might be so impressed by the
thoughts I air here about the feasibility and, indeed, intelligibility
of the project of making the world, the whole world, better that you
give way to a kind of despairing moral nihilism. Which you should not.
On the other hand, you might think there is some number, knowable at
least in principle, to God, which is a quantification on some meaningful
metric of the amount of value realized in the world from its beginning
to its end and that your moral job in your life is to make that number
higher than it would otherwise have been, and there is a way of living
that will help you make that likelier than otherwise. There is really a
kind of deep failure of humility here. Of course, you don't sensibly
expect to make a difference at that vast global level. Our lives can be
good in a much more local way, and that is far from nothing. It is a
splendid thing to make your house, or your city, beautiful whether or
not you believe you thereby make a positive addition to the overall
beauty of the whole world.

[The sphere of your moral responsibility **cannot extend beyond the
sphere of your control**. If you aspire to extend the former to
encompass the whole world, you will need to effect an equivalent
enlargement to the latter]{.underline}. And [**that is a dangerous
aspiration, the spur to conquer and improve. The world**, all of it**,
is not ours to improve**. To suppose otherwise is a]{.underline}
hubristic mistake, as I suggested before, a [kind of **moral
imperialism**]{.underline}.

If your children are ailing and in need of your attention, you should
attend to them. If your city is in danger and needs your service, you
should offer it. Of course, there are other children and other cities,
remote from you in space and time whom you cannot readily help in these
ways, however great are their needs. But mostly, they will have carers
and citizens of their own, and it is their job and not yours to step up.
[**You can't do it all and would be foolish to spread yourself too
thin**. At some point, we rely on the moral division of labour and stick
to our own patch. You can't make the world, the whole world, a better
place]{.underline}.5 [But you can keep your bedroom tidy]{.underline},
your garden beautiful, [and]{.underline} you can make [life happier for
those you love]{.underline}.

You cannot light up the whole world, but you can shine a light in your
small corner. Who knows? For some people, it may shine a long way,
perhaps a surprisingly long way, but the darkness will, of course,
engulf it at last. That is simply one of the limits within which, wise
people accept, we all must live.

Which is not to deny that the moral world is bigger than it was. Parfit
famously wrote,

> Until this century, most of mankind lived in small communities. What
> each did could affect only a few others. But conditions have now
> changed. Each of us can now, in countless ways, affect countless other
> people.6

This is undeniably true, and it is undeniably a game changer. For most
people for most of history, and for many people even now, the moral
world that made the sphere of their responsibility did not extend much
beyond their village and its nearest neighbours. If you were a medieval
European villager, if there was an earthquake in China or a famine in
the Horn of Africa, you would never have known about it, far less been
in a position to help. By looking after your property well, you could
make some difference to the likely felicity of your children, your
grandchildren, perhaps, your great-grandchildren. By good citizenship
and wise counsel, you could help your village thrive and prosper. But
much beyond that horizon, your causal capacity to affect in any
predictable ways people far away in space or time was effectively zero.
It's not that your actions would not ramify down the millennia. They
would, but in ways that were quite inscrutable to you and way beyond
your control.

[We are connected to people very distant from us in space and time in
ways]{.underline} that [we were not at earlier times in our
history]{.underline}, and [those connections]{.underline} properly
[expand the horizons of our moral concern and responsibility in dramatic
ways]{.underline}. We have the capacity to mess up the environment in
which our children and grandchildren and their children and
grandchildren, will live in new ways and are exercising that capacity in
alarming ways that we urgently need to be very attentive to. [We are in
danger of bequeathing to our descendants **a world that has been
poisoned** and **whose finite natural riches have been squandered**. We
should look after the terrestrial estate we pass on]{.underline}, and
[that is a far more consequential and far-reaching responsibility than
anything in the moral experience of]{.underline} even [the most powerful
people who lived a few centuries ago. **But our reach is still
limited**. What the world will be like in]{.underline}, say, the 9th,
never mind [the 90th, millennium]{.underline} of the Common Era [is
**out of our control in a very thoroughgoing way**. However much our
concerns are expanded]{.underline} from what they were in the past,
**[they fall far, far short of filling the world]{.underline}**. Because
the world---so much moral philosophy just quietly ignores this fact---is
enormous.

The sphere of our responsibility is a far bigger village than it once
was. But it is still a village. [Even our responsibility not to
massively boost]{.underline} the [carbon dioxide]{.underline} in the
atmosphere to the great detriment of future generations
[is]{.underline}, as noted earlier, a highly **[local]{.underline}**
one. Whether that would be a bad thing in the very long term is a
question we cannot, as we have seen, begin to hope to answer.

We must cultivate our garden. Part of what it is to have the virtue of
generosity is to conceive that garden in generous and inclusive ways
that reach beyond me, my family, and my ethnic, national, or religious
tribe, and we live perhaps in times when the virtue of generosity has
never been more important, and our capacity to aid or to endanger
distant others has never been greater. If we poison the ocean, life will
be unpleasant for our great-great- grandchildren and their
contemporaries, so we should not poison it, but that is because we
properly concern ourselves with our great- great-grandchildren and their
contemporaries, not because we concern ourselves, sub specie
aeternitatis, with the world.7 [If we poison the ocean]{.underline},
something, [lots of things, will]{.underline} almost [certainly adapt
and survive and set life on Earth on a new course]{.underline} that 10,
20 million years from now will people Earth with strange and wonderful
things we cannot now imagine. [If that should happen]{.underline}, I
wish those creatures well, and if I somehow find myself in a position to
direct harm their way, I should not do so, but they are not and really
cannot be the focus of my active benevolence. They are much too far
away, and [we will have to trust them to look after themselves. **All we
can ever do is cultivate our gardens. They, in turn, will perhaps
cultivate theirs**]{.underline}.

### Impact\-\--AT: Util

#### Reject [phenomenal introspection]{.underline}. 

**Bush '22** \[Lance; August 21; Lecturer in psychology at Cornell. PhD
in psychology, MA in philosophy. Researching moral psychology,
metaethics, and methodological issues in experimental philosophy; Lance
Independent, "Phenomenal introspection and hedonism,"
https://www.lanceindependent.com/p/phenomenal-introspection-and-hedonism\]

However, [my initial reaction is to reject (2) because it seems like
**Sinhababu** overestimates what **kinds** of **information** is
available via introspection on one's **phenomenology**]{.underline}, at
least not without bringing in substantial background assumptions that
aren\'t themselves part of the experience or that might have a causal
influence on the nature of the experience. It's possible, for instance,
that [a **commitment** to or sympathy towards **moral realism** can
influence one's **experiences** in such a way that those experiences
seem to confirm or support one's realist views, when in fact it's one's
**realist views** causing the **experience**]{.underline}. Since [people
lack **adequate introspective access** to their **unconscious**
psychological processes]{.underline}, [introspection may be an
**extraordinarily unreliable** tool for doing philosophy]{.underline}.
Philosophers may think that they can appeal to theoretically neutral
"seemings" to build philosophical theories, but not appreciate that the
causal linkages cut both ways, and that their philosophical
inclinations, built up over [years of studying academic
philosophy]{.underline}, [can influence how they **interpret** their
**experiences**, and do so in a way that isn't introspectively
accessible]{.underline}. If this does occur (and I suspect it not only
does, but is ubiquitous), philosophers who appeal to how things seem to
support their philosophical views are, effectively, appealing to their
commitment to their philosophical positions as evidence in support of
their commitment to their philosophical positions. Without a better
understanding of the psychological processes at play in philosophical
account-building, philosophers strike me as being in an epistemically
questionable situation when they so confidently appeal to their
philosophical intuitions and seemings.

Phenomenology involves access to what your experiences are like, but it
is not constituted by any substantive philosophical inferences about
those experiences. That is, if I have, say, an experience of something
seeming red, it isn't (and I think it couldn't) be a feature of that
experience that the redness of the red is, e.g., of such a kind so as to
be directly (perhaps "non-inferentially") inconsistent with a particular
model of perception or consciousness. For instance, [I don't think
substance dualism could be something one has phenomenal access to, but
rather it would be an inference, or position one takes]{.underline},
that explains one's experiences or may be inferred from one's
experiences.

When I have good or enjoyable experiences, my phenomenology involves
what I'd call positive affective states. I don't think anything about
these states includes, as a feature of the experience itself, that the
experience itself involves stance-independence or stance-independence
about the goodness of the experience. That doesn't seem like the sort of
thing that could be a feature of one's phenomenology. The notion that
phenomenal introspection informs us of hedonism thus strikes me almost
as a kind of category error. Substantive metaphysical theses don't seem
like the sorts of things one can experience. And thus the notion that
hedonism is true in a stance-independent way just isn't the kind of
thing that I think one could experience, since it's a metaphysical
thesis, not e.g., a phenomenal property (though as an aside I don't even
think there are phenomenal properties, but that's a separate issue).

Another way to put this is that [I don't think there'd be any
**experiential difference** between a **realist** and an **antirealist**
about their positive and negative affective states]{.underline}. I
experience "hedonic value," myself, but it isn't part of the experience
that its stance-independently true that it's good. This is a conclusion
I could reach about my experiences, but it isn't part of them.

[Second, nothing about the **phenomenology** of my positive affective
states is **distinctively moral**]{.underline}. [If I **eat my favorite
food**]{.underline} or listen to music I like, [I enjoy these
experiences, but they aren't **moral experiences**]{.underline}. As
such, [I see no reason to think that my **good** and **bad** experiences
reflect any kind of **distinctively moral** reality]{.underline}. It's
not a feature of my positive experiences that they are morally good. I
don't even know what that means, and I am confident no compelling
account from any philosopher will be forthcoming.

Note the conclusion: "Therefore, hedonism is true --- pleasure is the
only good."

[Even if pleasure were "**good**," and I do think positive experiences
are good]{.underline} (in an antirealist sense), [nothing about these
experiences strikes me as **morally good**]{.underline}. I don't think
there is any principled distinction between moral and nonmoral norms. I
think the very notion of morality is a culturally constructed
pseudocategory, not a legitimate category in which normative and
evaluative concepts could subsist independent of the idiosyncratic
tendency for certain linguistic communities to refer to them as "moral."
So it's not clear to me how my positive experiences relate in any
meaningful way to the culturally constructed notion of moral good that
persists in contemporary analytic philosophy.

I don't think any of my experiences involve any distinctively moral
phenomenology, and such experiences are better explained in nonmoral
terms. I'd note, however, that the notion that "hedonism is true"
doesn't make clear that hedonism is the true moral theory which isn't
explicitly stated here. I don't know if Sinhababu (or BB, or anyone
else) claims to have distinctively moral phenomenology, but I don't
think that I do, and I'm skeptical that anyone else does.

In any case, if this remark: "Therefore, hedonism is true --- pleasure
is the only good," ... is meant to convey the notion that hedonism is
true in a way indicative of moral realism, I still I am very confident
that it doesn't mean anything; that is, I think this is literally
unintelligible. I find my experiences to be good, in that I consider
them good, but I don't think this in any way indicates that they are
good independent of me considering them as such, nor do I think this
even makes any sense.

BB does just this practice of making inferences about BB's own
experiences when discussing the argument. BB says:

"[**Phenomenal introspection** involves reflecting on experiences and
**forming beliefs** about what they're like (e.g. I conclude that my
yellow wall is bright and that itching is uncomfortable]{.underline})."

[But the **latter** isn't part of **phenomenal
introspection**]{.underline}. Only the former is. [Phenomenal
introspection involves reflecting on your experiences such that you have
the appearance of a bright yellow wall and the sense of an
itch]{.underline}; the [**beliefs you form** about these experiences
**aren't part of the phenomenal introspection**; they're just standard
**philosophical reflection**]{.underline}, or theory-building, that
seeks to account for those experiences. And while we're all welcome to
engage in such theorizing, it's a mistake to say that those beliefs are
part of phenomenal introspection itself, or that you form beliefs about
what those experiences are like; what you describe instead seem like
inferences about what's true given those experiences. And [such
inferences aren't part of the phenomenology]{.underline}.

I could have the exact same phenomenology, and form the belief that
moral antirealism is true, and that realist hedonism is false, without
being mistaken or confused about what my experiences are like. This is
why appealing to phenomenology as a straight move towards realism (and
hedonism in particular) doesn't work: that hedonism is true just isn't
the sort of thing that's directly available via phenomenal
introspection.

There are other difficulties with BB's framing here:

Premise 2 is true --- when we reflect on pleasure we conclude that it's
good and that pain is bad.

This is ambiguous. What does BB mean by 'good' and 'bad'? Since I
understand these in antirealist terms, if Premise 2 is taken to imply
that they're true in a realist sense, then I simply deny the premise. I
find it odd and disappointing that BB would echo the common tendency for
philosophers to engage in such ambiguous claims. BB knows as well as I
do that one of the central disputes in metaethics is between realism and
antirealism. So why would BB present a premise that only includes, on
the surface, normative claims, without making the metaethical
presuppositions in the claim explicit?

This is not a critique of the argument, but the way BB presenting it. If
BB means good or bad in a realist sense, BB should make that explicit.
Not doing so adds needless ambiguity and lack of clarity to BB's
arguments. It's precisely the kind of hedging and ambiguity that allows
bad philosophers to equivocate and mislead others. BB shouldn't take up
their bad habits, so I encourage BB to start making the substantive
philosophical theses lurking behind the premises of arguments clearer.

This particular ambiguity is especially common in metaethics, and its
proliferation has a clear and perfidious rhetorical value: moral
realists often present normative claims, e.g., "x is good" or "it's
wrong to torture babies for fun," without making their metaethical
presuppositions explicit, e.g., "x is stance-independently good" or
"it's objectively wrong to torture babies for fun." Yet these normative
claims serve as the premises to arguments that presuppose realism, or
that are intended as arguments for realism, or are intended to prompt
intuitions against antirealism and in favor of realism. All of these
uses are illegitimate, because they rely on the inappropriate pragmatic
implicature that to reject the premise or the claim isn't merely to
reject its metaethical component (which has been concealed), but the
normative claim itself.

I'm a moral antirealist, and I think happiness is good, that torture is
wrong, and so on. I just don't think things are stance-independently
good or stance-independently bad. By playing fast and loose with
metaethical claims masquerading as normative claims, moral realists have
engaged in an ongoing campaign of misleadingly implying that they hold
all the normative cards in disputes between realists and antirealists.

This isn't merely philosophically questionable (since it involves a kind
of presumption that is either false or question-begging), it creates a
persistent atmosphere that the moral antirealist has poor normative
moral standards, lacks an acceptable attitude of repugnance and
opposition to things we agree are bad, doesn't genuinely value the good
things in life, and so on. I call this conflation between metaethics and
normative ethics normative entanglement. And I think BB has
inadvertently fallen into the habit of engaging in it in this post. I'd
ask that BB consider my point about normative entanglement, and consider
revising the way arguments for moral realism and against antirealism are
framed so as not to engage in normative entanglement.

[The other problem with this remark is the claim that when **"we"**
reflect on pleasure we conclude that it's **good** and that **pain is
bad**]{.underline}. **[Who's "we"]{.underline}**? [**Not me**,
certainly]{.underline}. [I don't reach the same conclusions as BB does
via introspection]{.underline}. BB echoes yet another bad habit of
contemporary analytic philosophers: [making **empirical claims** about
how other people think without doing the **requisite empirical
work**]{.underline}. BB does not have any direct access to what other
people's phenomenology is like, [so there's **little justification** in
making claims about what things are like for other people in the
**absence of evidence**]{.underline}. And there's little empirical
evidence most people claim to have phenomenology that lends itself to
moral realism.

#### Justifies slavery and genocide.

**Talbot '14** \[Marianne; July 19; Marianne Talbot Philosophy,
"Utilitarianism -- the Final Word on Morality?",
https://mariannetalbot.co.uk/2014/07/19/utilitarianism-the-final-word-on-morality/;
accessed: 7.16.25\]

[Utilitarianism, however, is **absolutist**]{.underline}. It [holds as
**absolutely** true -- true everywhere for everyone at every
time]{.underline} -- that the right action is that which (tends) to
produce the greatest happiness of the greatest number. Utilitarianism
may not be absolutist about 'lower order' moral rules ('do not lie'
etc.), but it is absolutist at a higher order.

It is in its non-absolutism, though, at the lower order, that
Utilitarianism meets problems.

Oddly enough, in these Utilitarian times, we are very keen indeed on
human rights. We hold them almost sacred.

But Utilitarianism has problems with the idea of human rights. After all
[if **genocide** would bring about the **greatest happ**iness of the
**greatest number**, genocide is acceptable, **morally
acceptable**]{.underline}. [If one could bring about the greatest
happiness of the greatest number by **enslaving** a given population, on
the other hand, then it is right -- **morally right**]{.underline} -- to
enslave them.

We can try various ways to wriggle out of this on behalf of the
Utilitarian. Many people would be unhappy about slavery -- not least the
slaves. But [if we can find a way -- any way -- to make the **utility
calculus** come out in favour of slavery then the utilitarian is
**committed** to arguing that slavery is right, **morally
right**]{.underline}.

Do you think Utilitarianism can survive this problem? Or does it show
that however useful [**Utilitarianism** is, it cannot be the **final
word** on morality]{.underline}?

#### They empower utility monsters.

**Albers '23** \[Evan; January 1; M.S. in Artificial Intelligence from
Northeastern University, B.A. in Philosophy, Computer Science, and
Financial Economics from Bowdoin College; Bowdoin Department of
Philosophy, "A Problem Best Put Off Until Tomorrow," pp. 22-23\]

[The **utility monster** is an **ugly result** of]{.underline} adherence
to [the **utilitarian principle**]{.underline}. Nozick proposes [a
character]{.underline} who is [**immune** to]{.underline} the tyranny of
**[d]{.underline}**iminishing **[m]{.underline}**arginal
**[u]{.underline}**tility. Many of us experience less utility from
successive consumption of some good; a few pastries are good, but each
additional pastry is rarely as good as the last, and eventually one just
wishes to stop eating all together. This is no issue for the utility
monster. Each additional pastry is equally as delicious as the last. [In
the **proverbial race** for utility]{.underline} then, [the monster will
**outlast** us]{.underline} all; he simply never gets tired of pastries,
and so long as he enjoys it more than we might even the first, then [our
**moral import** will never outweigh his]{.underline}. For a society
that is observing utilitarian principles, [the **utility maximizing**
choice **always** involves serving the monster]{.underline}. Any pastry
that we chance upon by virtue of luck or manufacture must be given to
the monster, as this would maximize utility. This might hold for either
the consideration of total utility or average utility -- in the latter
case the monster merely needs to enjoy significantly more utility from
any given resource to outpace the average increase, but it is still
logically possible to conceive of such a thing. Nozick charges that the
potential existence of the monster represents an objection to
utilitarianism (Nozick). It seems as though utilitarianism would bind
society in service to the monster by simple virtue of its spectacular
disposition, and Nozick finds this disturbing.

Perhaps [the monster is]{.underline} simply **[too
outlandish]{.underline}** to conceive. After all, [it seems to require
an individual **capable** of]{.underline} experiencing nearly
**[infinite utility]{.underline}**, and [this seems **fairly
unrealistic**]{.underline}. Is it so fair to discard a moral theory on
the grounds of an impossible being? Perhaps not. However, [if one were
to propose an **alternate form** of monster, the objection might
**recover** its force. Consider]{.underline} instead, [**all the
people** that might]{.underline} potentially [live]{.underline}.
Depending on our presumptions about the probability of their existence
and the magnitude of their population, our [decisions today]{.underline}
might [influence **untold quantities** of utility]{.underline}. Perhaps,
as long as enough people benefit, [we may find ourselves **bound** to
serve the future]{.underline} by the principle of utility. [There will
**always be**]{.underline} those [humans yet unborn]{.underline}.
Because their utility hinges on our present decisions, [we may find
ourselves **obligated to subordinate** our]{.underline} own
[interests]{.underline} and desires, even those we find reasonable or
feel intuitively entitled to, to the interests of the future. This mass
of [**future humanity** might act]{.underline}, in aggregate, [as a
**utility monster**]{.underline}.

#### Trying to save everyone kills value to life. 

Lina **Papadaki 21**, Assistant Professor in the Department of
Philosophy and Social Studies at the University of Crete, Ph.D. in

Salvation and Consolation," Philosophical Investigations, Vol. 44, No.

He is down to earth and well aware that life is no more than pain and
suffering. [The true altruist has devoted his life to preventing the
suffering of others]{.underline} as much as possible because he "\...
makes less distinction than is usually made between himself and others"
and the "\... principium individuationis, the form of the phenomenon, no
longer holds him so firmly in its grasp\..."43 His purpose in life is to
alleviate others' suffering, even at the cost of undergoing privations
and causing himself pain.44 [The life of the person who feels the pain
of all beings is far from easy and happy]{.underline}, but [it has a
noble purpose.]{.underline}

Schopenhauer could argue that [death is bound to **release this person
from suffering**]{.underline}, [putting an end to the striving of his
will]{.underline}. As Janaway explains: "Even [moral action resembles
ordinary **egoistic action**]{.underline} [in being concerned with the
fulfillment of desires]{.underline} for some individual's wellbeing.
Hence [even moral action achieves only **palliative
goods**]{.underline}. \... [Whatever desires one satisfies]{.underline},
whatever suffering one alleviates -- whether of this individual or that
-- [there will **always be more**]{.underline} unsatisfied desires and
more unalleviated suffering."45 [The altruist could be
consoled]{.underline}, then, [that death will come to cut short his
futile fight against suffering, which is in fact
**ineradicable**]{.underline}.

### Impact\-\--AT: Util\-\--Dignity Turn

#### Utilitarianism justifies sacrificing innocent individuals and violating fundamental rights in the name of the greater good---undermining [human dignity]{.underline} and [moral certainty.]{.underline}

**Sola '23** (Andrew Sola: earned his Ph.D. from the University of East
Anglia in Norwich, England. From 2004 to 2018, he was Professor of
Philosophy and English at the University of Maryland Global Campus,

Greater Good" Springer Nature Link)//GOATKUNA

Another forceful critique of utilitarianism is this: **[The theory
allows for and even demands the violation of individual human rights if
the consequences of the viola- tion yield more happiness]{.underline}**
(McCloskey, 1965). [Let's say we're in the city of Springfield during
the COVID-19 pandemic. A man described as having neck tat- toos has been
seen intentionally coughing at senior citizens throughout the city.
There are lots of men with neck tattoos, but the police can't find which
specific man is doing it. Some senior citizens end up dying from COVID.
People in the commu- nity are angry and demand justice. They form lynch
mobs and threaten to hang any man they find with a neck tattoo. The
police chief wants to end the rioting, but she needs to find the
perpetrator. The longer she waits, the more innocent tattooed men will
be assaulted and maybe even killed.]{.underline}

[She eventually rounds up a group of men with neck tattoos, and one of
them, Tom, tests positive for COVID-19. Is he the culprit? Maybe, but
Tom has a solid alibi. The police chief is certain that Tom didn't do
the coughing. What now? In the meantime, other tattooed men are being
hunted down and several are beaten so badly they end up in the hospital.
The chief decides that she might be able to frame Tom in order to stop
the violence. Of course, Tom would be unjustly convicted, but this
doesn't matter for the utilitarian police chief. **If framing Tom for a
crime he didn't commit leads to less violence and harm for the whole
community, then that action would be justified.**]{.underline}

We have already seen in the previous chapter that Immanuel Kant presents
some strong objections to this way of thinking. His [most simple
objection is that many **people falsely believe that they can accurately
predict the consequences of their actions.** In the scenario above, why
would the police chief be certain that framing the innocent man would
really lead to less violence? **There are other potential con-
sequences**. Maybe the violence would not end if the innocent man were
framed. Maybe the real perpetrator would confess. In short, Kant argues,
we cannot predict the future with certainty. What we do know, Kant would
insist, is that framing inno- cent people is always wrong. It violates
basic human rights, and we must never violate the rights of innocent
people no matter what the positive consequences may be.]{.underline}

Let's look at other problematic examples. [**What is wrong in the
utilitarian world- view if you violate someone's privacy without them
knowing it** (Rachels & Rachels, 2012, pp. 113--14)? For example, what
is wrong with hacking into a stranger's web- cam in order to spy on
them? In a utilitarian system, nothing. If Jack chooses to spy on Jill
for his own arousal, he could not be blamed (if and only if she never
discovers the spyware---the knowledge might cause her pain). After all,
Jack is increasing his happiness, and Jill is not even aware of the
violation of her privacy. Critics of strict utilitarianism argue that
the right to privacy is one that we all should have whether or not we
are aware that right is being violated.]{.underline}

Furthermore, in utilitarian theory[**, one person counts only for one
unit of happi- ness, but the community counts for much more than one;
therefore, an individual's rights can be violated for the good of the
community**. Eminent domain laws, which require individuals to give up
their land in order to make way for railroads, airports, pipelines, or
highways, are utilitarian devices that take away people's rights to
prop- erty. One healthy person has enough blood, tissue, and organs to
save the lives of 20 people. A utilitarian might conclude that the
healthy person can be sacrificed--- against her own will---for the
benefit of the others.]{.underline}

In short, the inviolable and priceless dignity of each and every human
being---the dignity that Immanuel Kant took great pains to
establish---is completely lost in the utilitarian system. And to put
this point more plainly, if you are inclined toward utilitarian
thinking, would you also agree to allow yourself, your spouse, your
child, your father, or your grandmother to be sacrificed for the greater
good?

#### Utilitarianism disregards moral obligations, duties, and promises from the past---undermining trust, loyalty, and ethical consistency.

**Sola '23** (Andrew Sola: Ph.D. from the University of East Anglia in

A final problem with utilitarianism is that **[its exclusive focus on
the consequences of actions means that the theory ignores obligations
derived from the past.]{.underline}** [Let's say you promised to go for
a walk in the park with a friend, but you don't feel like going anymore.
One reason to still go, despite your change in attitude, is because you
promised to do so in the past. However, **a utilitarian would ignore
your past prom- ises when making a decision because all that matters is
the consequences of your current decision.**]{.underline} Obligations
derived in that past are wiped away. [You could justify canceling the
walk because whatever pain you would cause by not going would be
outweighed by the pleasure achieved by doing whatever else you chose to
do instead of going.]{.underline} Of course, a utilitarian would also
allow you to break your promise if you tested positive for COVID-19 and
felt that it would be safer to quarantine at home--- for the benefit of
all. In this instance, breaking your promise would also be justified.

Let's look at another example[: You are a cancer doctor, and your
favorite patient is a kind, gentle old man named Winston. You've
developed a relationship of mutual support over the years, and you rely
on each other for advice and assistance. One day after his wife passed
away in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, you promised Winston
that you would always look after him and give him special atten- tion if
he was worried about his cancer returning. But now the pandemic has
added additional stress to your life, and you are exhausted and
overworked. One day, Winston calls you and asks for an unscheduled
check-up after hours to see if his cancer has returned. You've already
worked a 70-h week and really don't want to give anyone any special
favors. What do you do? Well, your past relationship and your promise
might be good reasons for you to continue to be supportive. However, a
utilitarian might argue that neither your past relationship nor your
promise to always help is a reason to continue to spend time and
resources on him.]{.underline} Indeed, if you feel that your time and
resources could be better spent helping others or even yourself, a
utilitarian would allow you to deny Winston's request.

And this is the final important criticism of utilitarianism: **[Its
exclusive focus on future consequences ignores many other important
factors in ethical decision- making, namely, obligations, duties, and
promises made in the past.]{.underline}**

#### Utilitarianism collapses into unstable moral reasoning---its fixation on outcomes overrides human rights, reduces morality to cost-benefit calculations, and sacrifices individuals under the guise of collective well-being.

[Intellectuals and politicians may be tempted to invoke 'utilitarian'
thinking to determine what should be done in a time of 'health crisis',
such as when a pandemic threatens many lives or the health deterioration
of many, and States consider slowing down human activities to limit that
risk. **Utilitarianism, however, which historically oscillates between
describing and prescribing behaviours**, is neither a system of
thought]{.underline} (even though it rejects any transcendent conception
of moral good) nor a univocal doctrine (as it is made up of several,
classical or contemporary, schools of thought) but a pragmatic,
consequential and universal moral philosophy of action. It is mainly
looking for norms that could maximise well-being (man wants and should
only want well-being), utility, for the greatest number of members of
the body politic (maybe, beyond, to the profit of non-subjects1), by
taking into account the consequences of choices made either individually
or collectively. The priority is therefore not so much to be virtuous,
or to conform to a normative rule, as to appreciate the idea and its
merits from the point of view of its concrete effects.2

[**Utilitarianism calls for an assessment of that well-being and thus
sometimes an economic quantification** which reduces the morality of
action to the result of calculations. Nonetheless, utilitarian
economists reason rather in terms of cardinal value ('the cost or the
price' of a thing, that of a psychological hedonism) or of ordinal value
(depending on the preferences that everyone declares they have to avoid
a risk or prioritise one's desires, a utility per pref- erence). Thus,
correcting the objectivist interpretations of Bentham's thought, the
school of thought derived from Mill's introduces the idea that the
pursuit of moral virtuous values from an altruistic perspective may also
be one of the goods considered in the calculation.]{.underline} Today's
utilitarianism moves away from Bentham and Mill yet again, by defining
utility as a criterion that is more objective than the mental state,
that is, as the satisfying of preferences, which supposedly represent
the well-being of the individual.3 In any case, [utilitarianism accepts
and integrates those limits. Knowledge is finite, or even limited; a
useful decision is made within a given context and conditions; thus the
solution resulting from the utilitarian reasoning varies depending on
circumstances, including emergency and uncertainty, and does not result
only from understanding. Utility comes from the will and prescription
that the law neutrally shapes.]{.underline}

[Utilitarianism therefore analyses the ends of action, and not, like
ethics, the respect of a priori principles. Similarly, it is the value
of the act and not that of the subject which matters. However, **it
collides with the separation of the current happiness of everyone and
its collective maximisation**]{.underline} [and looks for the conditions
of both coexisting, mainly through a system of adapted sanctions.
Therefore, a rule is not better than another in itself but rather when
their effects are compared, which leads to the difficulty of combining
prudential rationality and universal prescriptiveness]{.underline}.
Bentham managed to do it in his famous formula, 'Ethics at large may be
defined as the art of directing men's actions to the production of the
greatest possible quantity of happiness for those whose interests are in
view'.4

There results a strong criticism of human rights as natural and formal
subjective rights, the guarantee of which interferes with the principle
of utility, which seems better placed to produce equivalent individual
benefits. Conversely, those against utilitarianism denounce the fact
that, from a radical perspective, some individuals, and not only their
rights, without distinction, could be sacrificed on the altar of
complete well-being. For example, [quarantined patients who would be too
contagious to come near would not be treated. In response to that
position, some authors distinguish between the utility of rules and that
of acts, and give priority to the former, which allows to provide for
and go beyond particular cases which would put the individual directly
at the mercy of society.]{.underline}

[Thus, health could be not a 'right' but a utility, a guarantee for
other utilities, that one and the actions of the State ensure. Health
even tends to be assimilated with the idea of 'well-being':5 Health is
therefore seen as a good that, most of the time, everyone prioritises
for themself.]{.underline} The global character of that tendency results
in health being a collective and common good

#### Utilitarianism subordinates individual autonomy, health, and life to technocratic cost-benefit logic -- justifying state overreach, biopolitical control, and the sacrifice of the vulnerable in service of collective productivity and efficiency.

In principle, adopting an impersonal approach, [**utilitarianism does
not rank subjects nor types of worthy or unworthy lives but relies on
pleasures and pains** -- which are to be decided by individual will --
upon which the collective order is built, and which tend to favour
well-being.]{.underline} Bentham's 'felicific' calculus,7 which revolves
around a conception of the useful reduced to pleasure, draws upon
several criteria, which are combined and may oppose or reinforce one
another: duration (prevalence of long and sustainable pleasure),
intensity, certainty (prev- alence of positive pleasure on hypothetical
pleasure), proximity (prevalence of immediate pleasure, which goes along
the previous point), scope (a pleasure that is experienced with others
is more useful than one that is experienced alone), fecundity
(prevalence of a pleasure that triggers other pleasures), purity (a
pleasure which does not entail later pain is more useful than one that
may cause some).

[In the domain of health, those criteria apply with some specificities,
which are more or less extended depending on the chosen definition, from
the simple technique of care aiming for recovery from some pathology to
the complete state of well-being which is proposed by the World Health
Organization.8]{.underline} Health represents a fundamental asset, not
least because it indi- rectly conditions a lucid and autonomous will
exercised by fighting the illness which weakens the subject and its
productive strengths. It is supposed that everyone only wants to be in
good health. However, as a private good, or even as the right to
self-determination, utilitarianism will apply differently depending on
the meaning that is conferred upon that word, in terms of whether one
speaks of health in an objectivist, positivist or statistical way, as
conforming to or at variance with a supposed biological norm which is
presented in categories which are more or less arbitrarily decided,9 as
opposed to a more subjective conception which assesses the state of
health in relation to normalisation, the constant adaptation of the
physical individual norm.10 In the former case, the calculation of the
highest good may be done outside the person; in the latter, preferences
will be personalised and chosen together with the concerned party.
According to Rawls' criticism,11 [the neutral and impersonal perspective
of **utilitarianism, which is confused with impartiality, undermines
taking into account the moral subject**, which is reduced to its status
as a support for utility. One should not add utilities collectively as
is done for a same individual. However, a strict reading does not make
health an aim in itself but, as usual, an object supporting utility, and
consequently happiness; it may thus vary from one individual to another,
depending on the conditions weighing on its sensitivity.]{.underline}
Consequential logic will therefore balance it with other utilities
without making it sacred.

Health does not always come alone. It may involve the life of the
subject itself. [Putting someone in danger by exposing them to a
pathology or depriving them of care may destroy the subject itself,
possibly in the name of a higher collective utility. **Life must
therefore be intro- duced as a utility apart from and first among
others, the sacrifice of which would be detrimen- tal to global utility,
a utility that weighs so much in the calculus that it determines it to a
large extent** -- which amounts, practically speaking, to a sort of
deontology or rule utilitarianism.]{.underline}

[As a public good, as an aim of public health policies, the calculus
imagines some 'collective health'.]{.underline} The State has an
interest in everyone remaining in good health and protecting that of
others, for the productive effort or even the war effort, which can also
harm life and health, but are also, incidentally, a source of innovation
and development. [The State acts as guarantor and promoter of public
health and hygiene.12 Utilitarians are sometimes reproached as imagining
there is some collective health and not only the addition of individual
healths which may be the object of preventative and care
actions]{.underline}.13 The 'biopolitics' of Bentham and his disciples14
focused on education and care in the interest of the majority and only
took into consideration the results of that effort for the success of
economic liberalism, without caring for the bodily or moral integrity of
the individual. 'As Foucault noted, though [**utilitarianism was a
theoretical matrix of bio-politics -- as a way of rationalising
phenomena proper to a group of living beings established as a
population** -- it was nonetheless a challenge to
liberalism.'15]{.underline}

Discipline (in Foucault's meaning) goes along with the frugality of the
State in a liberal economy but, paradoxically and logically,
utilitarianism seems to call for more intervention from the government.
The utilitarian foundation of individual freedom as supported by a tra-
ditional economy would therefore be fundamentally deficient. Whereas
economic science has recommended that the State abstain in order to
leave individuals free to make their own choices, the results of social
sciences, which consider that the individual is not capable of making
rational and responsible choices, have reoriented that paradigm.
Behavioural econom- ics16 concentrated on the biases and inconsistencies
of individual behaviour. Orn the basis of those developments,
governments prescribe many virtuous behaviours under cover of preven-
tion, especially as to health, which correspond to what Foucault would
have called 'discipline'. Thus individual freedom could become not an
adjustment variable of the utilitarian economy but an end in itself,
which should be re-established as a central value of our society.17

Moreover[, **utilitarianism, with its 'cynicism', its pragmatism and
call for quantifying everything, may hurt sensitivities**, especially in
the domain of health -- the domain of vulner- ability, pain, death and
therefore empathy and solidarity. As a counterpoint, it is nonetheless a
way of speaking which doctors, scientists of the biomedical world,
public administrations and health or insurance companiers like, because
of its technocratic, objectifying, complex and elitist
content.]{.underline}

["**There is a freedom-killer element in utilitarianism. It is a
technocratic, overhanging moral philosophy for scientists**. English
philosopher Henry Sidgwick said it is a moral philosophy for rulers
because it goes against common sense. It reasons on the basis of the
collective, on aggregates. That explains why it is so pervading in the
medical world \[...\] there results a discrepancy between the
expectations based on the maximisation of preferences or well-being and
individual behaviours.18"]{.underline}

The rationalisation of decision-making increases its predictability and
reassures a medical world which is ever more costly and
technology-dependent. One should however nuance that statement by
explaining that the calculus must also take into consideration the
[**medical staff's support of the system, when they may feel there is an
important loss of meaning in an impersonal and collective utilitarian
calculus about a patient who cannot resolve to accept it themselves**.
Habermas19 tries to reconcile the deontologist and utilitarian
approaches by considering that the validity of a norm depends on how the
concerned parties accept its consequences.]{.underline}

#### Utilitarianism reduces life and health to economic variables---justifying the pricing of human beings, the neglect of the vulnerable, and the erosion of care ethics in favor of technocratic cost-efficiency.

[If it comes down to it, a purely economic analysis allows for giving
life a price.21 In 2020, Mathieu Mucherie, the head economist at BNP
Paribas Cardif, explained about the Covid-19 pandemic that 'not adopting
a unique value of human life, applied in a consistent manner in all the
areas of action, leads to the death of many persons who could have been
saved using the same means'.22 He explained that the value of human life
in France had been 'calculated' in 2013 at 3 million euros per person
based on]{.underline} the 'Quinet report' of the General Commissariat
for Strategy and Forecasting. 23 [Two methods may produce this type of
result: either by refer- ring to the human capital that society has lost
when someone dies]{.underline} (that is, the sum of the future
production of the person -- a method that is used in the judicial
context, especially for damages awarded to the families of victims of
terrorist attacks), or by referring to the 'individual con- senting to
paying to avoid an increase of risk' (for example, the compensation
employers pay for risky positions, for a job for which there is a
1/100000 chance of dying within the year, which therefore leads to \$900
higher compensation per year than for an equivalent position without
risk -- which results in the price of life being about 9 million
dollars).

Utilitarian calculus has been used in public health policies24 for more
than half a century. As early as the 1970s in the United States,
decision-making was rationalised (for technical investment as well as
individual care) by combining efficiency and cost based on the 'HTA'
calculation. In 1999, NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical
Excellence), the British assessment agency, considered that economic
assessment was the central element of the HTA model. However, faced with
oppositions to economic determinism, the ethical issue was solved by
multi-criteria analyses (mainly cost/usefulness and cost/benefit ones)
including some equity criteria. Then the unit of measure of benefit is
usually the [QALY (Quality-adjusted life year) which presents a value
between 0 (amounting to state of death) and 1 (perfect health). Any
intermediary value corresponds either to a fraction of a year in good
health, or to one year in a deteriorated state of health, or to a
combination of both. Passing, through aggrega- tion, from subjective
individual preferences to a socially]{.underline} objective QALY
indicator remains problematic. For example, patients who suffer a
pathology to which therapeutic means may bring an answer which
substantially improves their [life expectancy and quality of life will
be favoured over those who suffer a pathology for which medicine can
only marginally improve life conditions and quantity of
life.]{.underline} Moreover, the scientific rigour of those approaches
is being challenged today.

Over a few years and following a two-stage process of rationalisation of
health policies, the public economic calculus, in the domain of health,
has taken on a major importance by imposing the economic criterion as
the main decision-making one. In so doing, it has focused on a highly
technical utilitarian approach, imposing a form of ethics and social
justice widely challenged on the methodological, theoretical, practical
and operational levels.25

Whereas in the United Kingdom the use of utilitarian logics seems to be
quite developed, in France, Opinion 101 26 of the Comité Consultatif
National d'Ethique asks: 'Should \[...\] if necessary, the principle of
universal equality in the face of sickness be swept aside so as to
achieve a more equitable distribution of health resources and services?'
A 'utilitarian' approach, which conforms to distributive justice, would
answer positively to 'highlight the contradictory interests in society'
and would thus enlighten the democratic debate. The Comité nonetheless
thinks that the value of utilitarianism does not match that of
deontology, which is the unconditional guarantor of the human person.
According to the Comité, 'The ethical and economic constraints of the
hospital system -- which is also true for the more general context of
democracy \[...\] -- in fact reside in the opposition between two
apparently mutually exclusive concepts: the "unconditional value" of an
individual and "satisfying the greatest number".'

With regard to the notion of cost-effectiveness, it considers that
public health is not an ordinary good, but 'the very backbone of a
public service which keeps an essential relation with citizens'. '[The
utilitarian principle \[...\] cannot meet the requirements of justice if
it is realised at the cost of a great misfortune for a small number of
people.' As a social policy, the establishment of health services draws
on significant considerations of redistribution and social justice which
set off among 'prioritarianist' utilitarians quite a few lists of
arguments, mainly in favour of the poorest]{.underline}.27

During debates on how to price care, the choice of paying per medical
act was deemed both positive, since it allows to give medical staff a
sense of responsibility and to encourage them to be more productive, and
negative in that it may lead to not taking care of costly patients as it
does not take into account the role of hospitals in society, that is,
welcoming and taking charge of suffering (not only curing but also
caring). [Medical staff involved in choices would be diverted from their
compassionate role towards guilt, leading to bad management. Beyond
that, a more complete reading integrates the management and economic
considerations of the healthcare facility which delegates to the head of
department the concern for the cost-effective- ness of the health
service.]{.underline} The interest of the patient is combined with that
of the service in the positioning of the care offer. Depending on the
salary methods and ethics of the facility, depending on whether it is
deemed better to have a high level of bed occupancy or fast rotation, or
to keep a patient who needs acts which can be charged for rather than
another who brings no benefit, the patient themselves becomes a utility
for the system, which affects the calculus. Here, all the parameters
count: the cost burden (the patient, their insurance, the community),
the methods of financial and technical endowment of the service, how
necessary care is, the existence of other services which might take the
patient, what another patient requires. It is not certain that
rationality is explicitly set by the decision-maker.

[Charging per act has already been approached through leading heads of
services refusing or 'getting rid' of patients who might occupy beds
when they do not need charged care: that is the case for people in a
long-term coma state who may be left in their families' care or sent to
unsuitable medico-welfare establishments, or quite simply have their
treatment stopped, leading to their death.]{.underline} In France the
Vincent Lambert case ended in this way when [a minimally conscious
patient -- a patient who had left no instruction and whose family
disagreed on the testimony of his wishes, but who might still live for
many years without waking up, in a light coma -- was no longer
fed]{.underline}.28

In health issues, as well as in general, the assessment of collective
utility concentrates a number of difficulties. Thus, the main criticisms
against utilitarianism are about practical realisation. Even when
utility is not reduced to pleasure, and even without resorting to
prefer- ences, [it is difficult to establish \[unity\] the latter at the
individual level and even more at the collective one (see optimality of
Pareto). It is difficult to set a choice in a reasoning when there are
no unanimous preferences which also depend on initial capacities -- in
the health domain even more than in general.]{.underline} It is then
tempting to go back to an analysis in terms of needs and emer- gency,29
via a form of objectivation which is outside volition, which 'common'
utilitarianism uses a lot. In medical ethics, some authors try to make
situations comparable (by calling upon the capacity to 'put oneself in
someone's shoes') or to combine collective utilities by applying
coefficients to choices of rejection or demand. 30 It is therefore
complex (even when one has a lot of time to devote to the matter) to
determine which utility must really give a purpose to choices: economic
development, social cohesion, advancement of youth ...

#### Utilitarianism fails as a moral theory---it relies on impossible value comparisons, can\'t predict consequences with certainty, and permits gross injustice if it benefits the majority.

**SCMC '14** (Santa Clara Makkula Center for applied ethics, Date

Consequences:The Utilitarian Approach to Ethics, *Issues in
Ethic)*//GOATKUNA

[While utilitarianism is currently a very popular ethical theory, there
are some difficulties in relying on it as a sole method for moral
decision-making. First, the utilitarian calculation requires that we
assign values to the benefits and harms resulting from our actions and
compare them with the benefits and harms that might result from other
actions. But **it\'s often difficult, if not impossible, to measure and
compare the values of certain benefits and costs.** How do we go about
assigning a value to life or to art? And how do we go about comparing
the value of money with, for example, the value of life, the value of
time, or the value of human dignity? Moreover, can we ever be really
certain about all of the consequences of our actions?]{.underline} Our
ability to measure and to predict the benefits and harms resulting from
a course of action or a moral rule is dubious, to say the least.

Perhaps [**the greatest difficulty with utilitarianism is that it fails
to take into account considerations of justice**. We can imagine
instances where a certain course of action would produce great benefits
for society, but they would be clearly unjust. During the apartheid
regime in South Africa in the last century, South African whites, for
example, sometimes claimed that all South Africans---including
blacks---were better off under white rule. These whites claimed that in
those African nations that have traded a whites-only government for a
black or mixed one, social conditions have rapidly deteriorated. Civil
wars, economic decline, famine, and unrest, they predicted, will be the
result of allowing the black majority of South Africa to run the
government.]{.underline} If such a prediction were true---and the end of
apartheid has shown that the prediction was false---then the white
government of South Africa would have been morally justified by
utilitarianism, in spite of its injustice.

**Utilitarianism's commitment to maximizing pleasure leads to absurd
outcomes like the utility monster, reduces morality to subjective
preference, and commits the naturalistic fallacy by confusing pleasure
with moral goodness.**

Switching from total to average utilitarianism is not, however, a
sustainable solution. [We may have to choose between a population in
which happiness extends equally between individuals and a population in
which one individual devours all the happiness or all the resources
needed for producing happiness.]{.underline} The statistical contentment
per capita can be the same in the two models[, so average
**utilitarianism cannot tell them apart,** although intuition would
probably favor the more equal model. **This paradox,** made famous by
Robert Nozick, 83 has to be resolved in any better version of
utilitarianism.]{.underline}

The response to the utility monster challenge begins with the
realization that [**we cannot combine the straightforward accumulation
and a subjective definition of the good without causing problems**. 84
Since, moreover, accumulation, or maximization, is the basic tenet of
utilitarianism, the response to this challenge has to be in the
redefinition of the good. A proper choice of value here should also
answer the other standard axiological questions that face the
doctrine.]{.underline} Do we ignore higher values if we count only
simple hedonistic factors? [**Is a psychopath's pleasure for torturing
people truly as important as the pain induced in the process? What if
people get pleasure out of adaptive things**, things that they choose
only because they are easily available?]{.underline} 85,86 In the late
19th century, Herbert Spencer presented one solution by suggesting that
the free and socially unencumbered evolution of a perfectly and
voluntarily altruistic humankind is the maximum good that we should
pursue. 87 This idea of defining the good objectively did not catch
on,88 but it partly inspired a criticism of classical utilitarianism
that prompted it to develop further.

Naturalistic Fallacy

In his critical contribution, G. E. Moore bundled together Spencer's
evolutionism and the hedonism of Jeremy Bentham, 89 John Stuart Mill, 90
and Henry Sidgwick, 91 called their ethics naturalistic, and reproached
them all for committing what he called the "naturalistic fallacy."92
Essentially, he argued that [the good always eludes any attempts to
define it in terms of experiences, physiology, biology, and the like. In
the end, we can always ask, "Yes, it is pleasurable---but is it good?"
and the meaning department in our minds understands that this is a valid
question and the two things conceptually separate from each other. 93
Moore himself said that we must know what is good intuitively 94 and
continued]{.underline}, "By far the most valuable things, which we know
or can imagine, are certain states of consciousness, which may be
roughly described as the pleasures of human intercourse and the
enjoyment of beautiful objects."95 This view impressed Moore's fellow
philosophers and augured, in English-speaking countries, a metaethical
turn, but it did not offer the clear guidance for utilitarian
decisionmaking that he himself seemed to require in his later work.96
Half a century later, preference utilitarianism and its cronies steered
the course back to practical applicability, 97,98,99,100,101,102,103 but
by that time, con- demnations by Rawls and others had already undermined
the theory's wider appeal. 104,105,106

1 AGAINST ADDITIONAL VALUE VIEWS

Begin by [consider]{.underline}ing the following pair of [possible
outcomes: A)People]{.underline} continue [being born into the indefinite
future, but with lives]{.underline} that are [all miserable]{.underline}
(that is, very bad, not worth living). [B)Extinction.]{.underline} For
present purposes, we can understand extinction to mean the end of
humanity, including the end of all presently existing lives as well as
the possibility of any future ones. This ending need not be "swift," as
it may be in the case of (e.g.) a nuclear war. Alternatively, the end
may result from there simply being no additional people who (could) come
into existence, while the final generation of people live out the rest
of their lives. So, in weighing A and B, we need not take into account
the badness of the premature deaths of all existing people. To set
terms, we can imagine that, in B, humanity would die out in this way in
(say) the year 2200. Moreover, in A, we should suppose there is no
chance of the lives ever improving, and so that all future lives would
invariably be uniformly miserable. Faced with a choice between A and B,
in any case, which should we choose? Clearly, or so it seems to me, we
should choose B. Typically, [when considering the badness of human
extinction,]{.underline} we are especially [distressed by]{.underline}
the [prospect of **no further good lives**]{.underline} ever again
coming into existence. What\'s so upsetting, we think, is the great
potential that extinction would destroy. Yet [when all that\'s destroyed
is an indefinitely long]{.underline} future of miserable lives and
[suffering,]{.underline} it seems clear that there is [not much for us
to be upset about.]{.underline} What should upset us, instead, is the
prospect of this very bad future. So, it seems clear enough to me, we
should prefer B to A. The welfare aggregation view clearly endorses this
choice. After all, [if all that\'s bad about extinction is that it would
preclude the existence of future lives worth living, then it will not be
bad when the only alt]{.underline}ernative is one where [all future
lives are miserable.]{.underline} If there is no possibility where there
are future lives worth living, on the welfare aggregation view, then the
badness of extinction---which derives entirely from the loss of
potential lives worth living---is extinguished. Defenders of the welfare
aggregation view are then well-positioned to endorse the intuition that
B would be better than A. Additional value views seem similarly
well-positioned---at least, on any plausible precisification of them.
While these views admittedly leave open the extent to which their
additional values are indeed valuable, it seems clear, given their
qualifications regarding the goodness of future lives, that they will
not take their additional values to outweigh the badness of generation
after generation of miserable lives. If they did, after all, it would
amount to claiming that (e.g.) humanity\'s final value was so great as
to outweigh practically any amount of badness in the lives making
humanity up. [Humanity]{.underline}, in other words, could be
[constituted by nothing but]{.underline} very **[bad
lives,]{.underline}** and [yet still be so valuable in itself that it
required promotion into the indefinite future. **This is
implausible.**]{.underline} Unless we are committed to a grossly extreme
axiology on which the existence of (say) human beings, or "rational"
beings, or fully autonomous beings, or the like, have some type of
"absolute" value, or value that outweighs any amount of badness
contained in the lives of those beings, [we should reject that humanity
has such overwhelming value.]{.underline} And so, we should reject that
humanity\'s (putative) additional value could make A better than B.
Additional value views, as I say, may endorse this conclusion. They
claim that humanity\'s continued existence has some additional value,
outside of the goodness of the future lives, but they\'ve never claimed
it has that much value. This, though, raises the obvious question: then
how much additional value does it have? We now have a clear idea of how
much value it does not have, but it then seems natural to wonder how
much value, if any, it might have. And, here, I\'m wary of the potential
answers. In A, the lives would be miserable. And, of course, lives can
be bad without being miserable. So let\'s consider another pair of
possible outcomes: C)People continue being born into the indefinite
future, but with lives that are all barely not worth living.
B)Extinction. In C, the lives would be (uniformly and inevitably) bad,
but not miserable. In particular, they would be just barely not worth
living. Still, humanity would continue existing. Does this make C better
than B? Again, the [welfare aggregation view answers]{.underline} No.
Since the [value of humanity\'s continued existence is **derived
entirely from the goodness of the lives** it contains, this view claims,
a humanity containing just lives that would not be worth living **would
not be better than extinction.**]{.underline} Extending the view to
account for disvalue, it claims that C would be worse than B, given the
great amount of badness contained in the lives making humanity up. So,
again, the welfare aggregation view gives a straightforward, and not
obviously implausible, answer. What of additional value views? Here,
admittedly, I can only speculate. What I imagine, though, is that
proponents of these views would want to deny that humanity\'s continued
existence would make C better than B.5 (As we\'ll see, little will hang
on whether I\'m correct about this.6) Granted, they may again claim,
humanity\'s continued existence has some additional value, outside of
the goodness of the future lives, but this value again fails to outweigh
the great amount of badness contained in the very many future lives that
would be barely not worth living. In fact, I would hope proponents of
these views would claim, this great amount of badness makes C worse than
B, and so we should prefer B to C. Here, though, are the beginnings of a
puzzle. To see it, compare next another pair of possible outcomes:
D)People continue being born into the indefinite future, with lives that
are all barely worth living. B)Extinction. Presumably, all would agree
that D would be better than B.7,8 The lives in D may be (uniformly and
inevitably) barely worth living, but they remain worth living, and the
(putative) additional value of humanity\'s continued existence would be
secured. So, we would have nothing telling in favor of B, and at least
one---and perhaps two, if we accept an additional value view---strong
consideration(s) in favor of D. Now, though, we may imagine a continuum
of possible outcomes, specifically between C and D. In C, the lives
would be uniformly barely not worth living, and in D, the lives would be
uniformly barely worth living. The continuum I have in mind is made up
of the possible outcomes in which we "flip" the quality of a given life
in C or D to look like a life in the other, one by one, until we move
entirely from C to D or vice versa. That is, if we start from C, we can
imagine a nearby possible outcome in which all the lives, minus one,
remain barely not worth living, and the one other life is barely worth
living. We can then imagine a nearby possible outcome in which all the
lives, minus two, remain barely not worth living, and the two other
lives are barely worth living. We can then repeat this process until we
end up with a possible outcome where all the lives are barely worth
living---or, until we end up with D. For each of these possible
outcomes, we can compare it with extinction. Would it be better, worse,
or equally as good as, extinction? The welfare aggregation view will in
each case have a straightforward answer: if the balance of welfare is
positive, the outcome is better than extinction; if negative, the
outcome is worse than extinction; and if neutral, the outcome is equally
as good as extinction. Intuitively, these answers are at least not
obviously implausible: if there are more good lives than bad, then
humanity\'s continued existence is better than extinction, and if not,
not. Whether we should accept these verdicts depends on whether there
are any more plausible ones available. [Do additional value views fare
better? It is unclear.]{.underline} After all, on additional value
views, matters are not so simple. Presumably, I have said, the views
will imply that D---where all the lives are barely worth living---would
be better than extinction. They will also imply, I\'ve suggested, that
C---where all the lives are barely not worth living---would be worse
than extinction. At some point on our continuum from D to C, therefore,
the views will imply that we have gone from an outcome that would be
better than extinction, to an outcome that would not be better than
extinction. But it is unclear where exactly this point might be.
Presumably---a qualifier I am, again, forced to use---the point would be
further down the continuum than it is on the welfare aggregation view,
or further down than the outcome in which the total welfare was neutral.
After all, if humanity\'s continued existence has additional value,
outside the goodness of the future lives, then an outcome in which the
total welfare was neutral yet humanity continued existing would
presumably, in virtue of that additional value, be better than
extinction. Thus, if that\'s right, additional value views must imply
that at some point between this outcome, where the total welfare was
neutral, and C, where the lives are all barely not worth living, we move
from an outcome that is better than extinction, to one that is not
better than extinction. Consider the first step on this part of the
continuum. We move from the outcome where the balance of lives that
would be barely worth living and lives that would be barely not worth
living was neutral, to an outcome where just one of these lives that
would be barely worth living is "flipped," and would now be barely not
worth living, and all else is equal. [That is, we move to an outcome
where half of the lives, minus one, would be barely worth living, and
half of the lives, plus one, would be barely not worth
living.]{.underline} Call this the barely-welfare-negative outcome. Do
additional value views imply that this second outcome, where the total
welfare would be negative---albeit barely so---would also be better than
extinction? [Again, of course, it is unclear.]{.underline} Regardless of
the answer, though, **[additional value views seem to face
trouble.]{.underline}** Let me explain. Suppose first additional value
views imply that this barely-welfare-negative outcome would not be
better than extinction. In virtue of the negative balance of total
welfare, proponents of the views might claim, the outcome cannot be
better than extinction. As soon as the total welfare becomes negative,
the possibility of the outcome\'s being better than extinction is ruled
out. This response, they may further claim, is in line with their stated
caveat that humanity may have their putative additional value only if
the future lives it contains are "flourishing" or, at least, "worth
living."9 In this case, additional value views would be not all that
dissimilar to the welfare aggregation view: the latter implies that the
outcome where the total welfare would be neutral would not be better
than extinction; the former, that while this outcome would be better
than extinction, the one where we "flip" the quality of just one of the
lives would not be better than extinction.

### Impact\-\--AT: Util\-\--Hedonism

#### Hedonism fails to explain why pleasure is intrinsically valuable.

and Religion at Truman State University, "Against the Intrinsic Value of
Pleasure" J Value Inquiry 43, pp. 33--39, Jan 23 2009,

[Hedonists hold that pleasure is the only thing of intrinsic
value]{.underline} and, thus, that a persons well-being is reducible to
the amount of pleasure she experiences.1 One way to challenge hedonism
is to contest the claim that only pleasure is intrinsically valuable; a
well-known argument of this form is found in [Robert Nozick's experience
machine thought experiment]{.underline}, which [suggests that other
things matter to us in addition to ''how things feel on the
inside.']{.underline}'2 A plausible reading of the notion of other
things mattering to us is to understand this as a way of saying that
other things besides pleasure, or how things feel, have intrinsic value.
If this is correct, then [hedonism is mistaken.]{.underline} What goes
unchallenged with this kind of argument is the assumption that pleasure
has intrinsic value. However, [the view]{.underline} that [pleasure is
intrinsically valuable can be challenged by considering the
**evolutionary role of pleasure as an experiential signal** that both
tracks individual well-being enhancing activity and motivates an
individual to pursue things which contribute to]{.underline} his or her
[well-being.]{.underline} These ideas should hold, mutatis mutandis, for
pain. Elliott Sober and David Sloan Wilson have argued that
[evolutionary psychology provides grounds for rejecting psychological
hedonism.]{.underline}3 However, the argument we will consider is that
reflecting upon [an evolutionary account]{.underline} of the emergence
[of the capacity for pleasur]{.underline}able experiences provides a
reminder of the important relationship pleasures, as a kind, have to
other goods, and [thus cannot have their value
intrinsically.]{.underline} This is an argument against normative
hedonism. If it is correct, then [pleasure has value, but not intrinsic
value,]{.underline} and thus is not the summum bonum. [As a result,
hedonism,]{.underline} in its normative sense, **[fails to provide a
plausible conception of well-being.]{.underline}** Let us consider two
ways in which we might define ''intrinsic value.'' The first way,
following Moore, is to claim that something is intrinsically valuable if
and only if it is valuable for its own sake, or in itself, in virtue of
its intrinsic properties, rather than because of its usefulness in
attaining some other good.4 On this conception, something has intrinsic
value if its total value cannot be reduced to its extrinsic,
instrumentally valuable, properties. A second way to define ''intrinsic
value,'' taken, for instance by Richard Brandt, is to say that something
is intrinsically valuable if and only if it is desirable for its own
sake, or intrinsically desirable.5 On this conception, something has
intrinsic value if what makes it desirable cannot be reduced to its
extrinsic properties. It is important to distinguish between something
being desirable for its own sake and something being desired for its own
sake, insofar as it is possible that we might desire something for its
own sake without what we desire actually being worthy of such desire.
What the two conceptions of intrinsic value share is the idea that
something has intrinsic value if its total value, or desirability,
cannot be reduced to the extrinsic, instrumentally valuable, properties
it has. They differ in that a proponent of the prior conception is not
committed to defining value as a function of desirability; someone might
instead, for example, define ''intrinsic value'' as a sui generis
property, as G. E. Moore is sometimes thought to have done in Principia
Ethica with respect to what he took ''good'' to signify. Pleasure, it
would appear, is a plausible candidate for having the status of
intrinsic value on either definition, since it seems to be, by its very
nature, a positive thing, and we often seem to desire pleasure for its
own sake. That does not imply that pleasure is desirable, but let us
assume that the apparent reasonableness of many of our actual desires
for pleasure makes the intrinsic desirability of pleasure prima facie
plausible. Let us briefly [consider the origin of the experience of
pleasure.]{.underline} A plausible evolutionary account can be roughly
set out as follows: [pleasurable experiences are a way of motivating an
organism to keep doing what it is doing, or to do things like what it is
doing in the future; the organism receives the experiential
reward,]{.underline} because what it is doing contributes to its
fitness. [Similarly, painful experiences motivate the organism to quit
its current activity and to avoid such things in the
future,]{.underline} because such activities or things lower its
fitness. [Thus, pleasant experiences **emerged as a way of tracking and
signaling resources and behaviors**]{.underline} which contribute to the
organisms fitness, a large part of which is characterized by its
physiological well-being, since an organism that is not faring well
physiologically does not stand as good a chance of successfully
reproducing. For psychologically and socially complex beings such as
ourselves, however, it is reasonable to suppose that in addition to
physiological well-being, psychological well-being and social well-being
are also typically essential to our overall evolutionary fitness. On
this account, both pleasant and painful experiences have instrumental
value, since such experiences serve to track beneficial activity and to
motivate an organism to pursue that which is beneficial and to avoid
that which is not.6 Importantly, [from an evolutionary point of view,
pleasure has **only instrumental value.**]{.underline} However, it might
be objected that this causal account of the origin of pleasure, which
would have us place the usefulness of pleasure in the service of
reproductive fitness, fails to take into account the value that pleasure
has for an agent as a conscious, experiencing being. If the agent enjoys
pleasant experiences, then does this not that suggest that pleasant
experiences have some further value in addition to their instrumental
value? It could then be suggested that even if we put considerations of
fitness aside, and with them the physiological, psychological, and
social well-being which are associated with fitness, the fact that an
experience is enjoyable indicates a further value that the experience
has, simply in virtue of the kind of experience it is, a pleasant
experience. Such experiences are preferable to painful experiences, and
presumably also preferable to their simple absence; presumably, it is
preferable to be having a pleasant experience than not to be. This
preferability seems, on the one hand, to be something that is due to the
intrinsic nature of such experiences, and on the other hand, to be what
makes such experiences desirable in themselves. Let us focus upon the
view that pleasures are intrinsically valuable because they are
intrinsically desirable. The motivation for this view is the idea that,
as a kind, pleasant experiences are preferable to their absence. They
are enjoyable in themselves, and this seems to be true even when they do
not contribute in any clear way to our evolutionary fitness, as with the
pleasure of sex with contraceptives, beer, and cigarettes. As we have
seen, [the fact that we happen to desire particular pleasures for their
own sake does not necessarily imply that such pleasures are desirable
for their own sake.]{.underline} But let us focus on the claim that, as
a distinct kind, pleasant experiences are intrinsically desirable. If
that can be established, then a hedonist can solve problems about
specific pleasures that lead to later pains by saying that while the
pleasure itself, as the kind of experience it is, is intrinsically
desirable, the means through which some particular pleasure is achieved
are not desirable because they increase the likelihood of later pains.
The problem with the claim that pleasure is intrinsically desirable has
to do with the fact that our natural attraction to pleasant experiences
is generated by the existence of a fairly stable relationship between
things that produce such experiences and their conduciveness to our
fitness. If pleasant experiences emerged as a way of tracking and
signaling things that are conducive to fitness, which includes, for us,
our physiological, AGAINST THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF PLEASURE 35
psychological, and social well-being, then, from this perspective,
pleasant experiences are instrumentally valuable because of what they
track. Even if we are not particularly concerned with our evolutionary
fitness, it is reasonable to assume that we are concerned about our
physiological, psychological, and social well-being. [Someone
might]{.underline} then [say that what justifies our concern with these
dimensions of well-being is that faring well along them increases the
likelihood of overall pleasure.]{.underline} In fact, this is what
hedonists must say. [But the reasoning]{.underline} then [becomes
circular: we are naturally configured to desire pleasant experiences,
because they contribute to our physiological, psychological, and social
well-being, and we desire faring well along these dimensions because
doing so is likely to contribute to our overall pleasure.]{.underline}
To break the circle, and to explain which goods have the more
fundamental value, the hedonist then adds that we desire pleasure for
its own sake, because it is intrinsically desirable. But if we are
configured to desire pleasure, then to say that pleasure is
intrinsically desirable can mean nothing more than that we find pleasure
desirable, because that is the way we are configured. However, [we are
configured]{.underline} that way for a reason, and it is [not because
pleasure is intrinsically desirable, but because pleasure emerged as a
means for tracking things that are conducive to our **fitness**, and our
**physiological**, **psychological**, and **social
well-being**.]{.underline} This is not entirely correct, evolutionarily
speaking, since we may be configured to make certain kinds of
self-sacrifices in the interest of our genetic legacy. Let us assume
that such self-sacrifices are exceptional cases, since typically a human
being must be faring well physiologically, psychologically, and socially
in order to pass on its genes. Let us also assume that physiological,
psychological, and social well-being are themselves desirable goods, not
just because of their role in evolutionary fitness, but more importantly
because they seem to be reasonable grounds for assessing the quality of
a person's life. Presumably, even a hedonist can accept this
stipulation. If pleasure emerged as a way of tracking fitness via
physiological, psychological, and social well-being, we can say that
typically, and by proxy, [pleasant experiences track these forms of
well-being.]{.underline} Since, as has been assumed, these forms of
well-being are themselves desirable, then pleasant experiences seem to
derive their desirability from the good things which they track. This
implies that the [desirability of pleasant experiences as a kind depends
upon their stable relationship to things and activities that are
**conducive to these forms of well-being**.]{.underline} It appears,
[then,]{.underline} that [pleasure has only instrumental
value.]{.underline} The [issue]{.underline} here [is not whether
pleasure is desirable, but whether it is intrinsically
desirable.]{.underline} **[The desirability of pleasure cannot be
intrinsic]{.underline}** 36 MATTHEW PIANALTO [because its desirability
is dependent upon the relationship **between pleasant
experiences**]{.underline} and things [**that are conducive to
physiological, psychological,** and **social well-being.**]{.underline}
Since the connection between pleasure and that which is conducive to
these forms of well-being is a relational, and contingent, feature of
pleasure, [this is necessarily an extrinsic property of
pleasure.]{.underline} Thus, it is possible that pleasure as a kind
might have been stably associated with things that are not conducive to
these forms of well-being. Since pleasant experiences motivate us to
pursue things that provide such experiences, the pursuit of such
pleasantries would lead to an early grave. This is not something that
any normal person desires or would think desirable under normal
circumstances. Thus, if pleasures, as a kind, were not reliably
connected to things that are conducive to these forms of well-being, it
would be quite implausible to claim that the experiences themselves are
intrinsically desirable, even if beings configured to desire such
pleasures could not but help desiring and pursuing them. In a well-known
experiment by James Olds and Peter Milner in which rats repeatedly
pressed a lever to stimulate the pleasure centers in their brains, the
rats desired the pleasure, but it seems reasonable to claim that the
pleasure is not really desirable, because it motivated the rats to
engage in a behavior that, if continued indefinitely and to the neglect
of nutriment, would lead to their demise.7 A hedonist might respond, in
the case of the experiment by Olds and Milner, that while the effects of
the particular way of pursuing pleasure is negative, this does not imply
that the particular pleasure itself, considered in itself regardless of
its causes or consequences, is not intrinsically valuable. But we are
supposed to be considering pleasure as a kind, rather than any
particular pleasure. If it turned out that all pleasures were reliably
associated with things that thwart the forms of well-being at issue, we
would see clearly that pleasures are not intrinsically desirable,
because it is entirely unclear how something which reliably thwarts our
well-being along the dimensions we have considered could still somehow
make an independent contribution to our well-being in some other sense.
This is a distinctive problem for a hedonist who claims that pleasure is
the only thing of intrinsic value, because the claim is supposed to
support the hedonist view that we can analyze well-being in terms of
aggregated pleasure. But if the general pursuit of pleasure posed a
serious threat to the livelihood of an individual, which is the locus of
this aggregation, then hedonism would be absurd. That hedonism does not
seem absurd in the real world is due to the fact that pleasure, as a
kind, is not linked to these sorts of things. However, [the fact that
the value of pleasure seems to depend on **the nature of its source**
seems to show that the prospects for pleasure being intrinsically
valuable, rather than simply valuable, are dim.]{.underline} Since the
[desirability of pleasure depends upon an **appropriate link to
something beyond the pleasure itself,**]{.underline} it is clear that
its **[desirability is not intrinsic.]{.underline}** Since the prospect
of pleasure is a deeply motivating force, we are fortunate to the extent
that pleasures are linked to things that are conducive to the other
forms of well-being. If the link had been otherwise, our craving for
pleasure would have been such as to put us more often into dire straits.
In a land of plenty, our craving for pleasure often does just this. This
is where we have to take note of the fact that the conditions of modern
living, and the resources available to indivduals living in affluent
societies, differ greatly from the conditions of the ancestral
environment, where resources were either scarce or difficult to attain,
and thus where the risk of gorging ourselves on resources to the point
of harm was less likely to occur. Someone might again raise the
objection based upon the enjoyableness of pleasures from an agent's
perspective, and argue that this type of simple enjoyment indicates a
value that pleasure has which is additional to the value it derives from
tracking and signaling behavior that is conducive to these other forms
of well-being. However, the point of this argument is not to show that
pleasures are not valuable or desirable, but only that their value or
desirability is not intrinsic. The enjoyment of harmless pleasures is
desirable and not simply desired, because such enjoyments contribute to
the other forms of well-being already mentioned. The enjoyment of our
life and activities is an important component of psychological
well-being; furthermore, to the extent that enjoyment contributes to
psychological flourishing, it also likely has some effect on our
physiological well-being. Recent research suggests significant
relationships between positive affect, in which we can include
aggregated experiences of pleasure, and various indicators of physical
health.8 In addition, people who partake of such pleasures tend to be
enjoyable to be around and show us how to appreciate life in its many
details. Enjoyment is a contributor to our well-being, but not the
foundation of it. [If pleasure is but one of many desirable things, and
its desirability must be accounted for in terms of its relationship to
other things of value, then there is no reason to claim that the value
it has is intrinsic value. But hedonists seem committed to the claim
that pleasure]{.underline} is not simply valuable, but [intrinsically
valuable.]{.underline} If a hedonist attempted to drop the adverb
''intrinsically,'' and to claim that pleasure is the only thing that is
valuable, that would seem implausible. The foregoing argument may
actually point to a deeper problem with the very notion of intrinsic
value and the thought that anything of value, or anything worthy of
desire, can be isolated and articulated without bringing into discussion
a whole web of values, needs, and interests that allow us to put any
particular claim to 38 MATTHEW PIANALTO value into context.9 Thus, if a
more general argument against the coherence of the very notion of
intrinsic value can be provided, then the particular arguments offered
here against hedonism will prove to be unnecessary. In this respect, the
foregoing arguments may be regarded as a case study in the difficulties
in a common application of the notion of intrinsic value, one of which
is a problem of how we are to appraise the value of a thing or state, in
this case pleasure, in itself.10

### Impact\-\--AT: Util\-\--Longtermism

MacAskill is still looking at the future from an immediate perspective:
he has a shorterm view on the longterm future, not a longterm view at
all. [The million-year view]{.underline} that MacAskill claims to take
[is both **farcical** and **difficult to wrap your head
around**]{.underline}. Here is what [a]{.underline} really [longterm
perspective would]{.underline} look like: [Say]{.underline} you have a
savings account, like most savings accounts right now, with a pretty a
bad interest rate -- 3% for instance. Beguiled by MacAskill's appeals to
emotion, you decide that you need to think of the children; that is, the
children a million years away. So you [put]{.underline} exactly [\$1
into this account which]{.underline}, you tell the bank, is [to be
withdrawn in a million years to solve all the future's problems. You
then die peacefully]{.underline}, knowing that you have singlehandedly
saved the longterm future. A hundred years after your death, there will
not be even \$20 in the account, but [a thousand years after your death,
your dollar]{.underline} has [turned into almost \$7
trillion]{.underline}. For measure, this is about 40% larger than
Japan's current gross domestic product. Ten thousand years after your
death, you will have bestowed upon the future about \$2.35e+128, which
is roughly 10116 times the size of the United Nation's estimate of the
world's current gross domestic product at around \$85 trillion. [In a
hundred thousand years, your donation to the future will be worth around
\$5.27e+1283]{.underline}, [and after the full million years it is so
large]{.underline} that [it can only be approximately calculated as
\$1012,837]{.underline} which is [a number so large]{.underline} that
[it is]{.underline} almost [impossible to compare it to
anything]{.underline}. The number of atoms in the known universe, for
example, is about 1080; if you were to buy worlds at \$85 trillion a
piece, you would still have trillions of times more worlds than the
number of atoms in the universe; if you were to reduce each world to the
size of an atom, you could buy more than eight hundred and fifty
universes. If, rather than \$1, you were to match the largest
philanthropic donation ever of around \$100 billion by Jamsetji Tata,
your donation would be worth \$1012,849 after a million years, which is
not a lot bigger than \$10 12,837 really.

[Of course, long before you reach this point, **the global economic
system would have collapsed because of your donation**. This
is]{.underline} not meant as a practical suggestion but is supposed [to
reduce to absurdity the idea of a million-year view]{.underline}, and
[it]{.underline} really [**makes a mockery of the** whole **longtermist
motivation** of the effective altruism movement. **The future is simply
too large to think about in any detail**]{.underline}. MacAskill does
not realize just how big a million years is. [**It is unfathomable**.
Everything turns to dust in that kind of time]{.underline}: even a
hundred billion dollars ends up indistinguishable from a single dollar.
[Utilitarianism was criticised for being demanding in requiring
impartiality, but longtermism **takes those demands and puts them on
steroids**. The idea]{.underline} that [we can]{.underline} even [be
morally concerned about what is a million years away, yet again obliged
to do something about it, is **utter folly**]{.underline}. And, of
course, Immanuel Kant tells us that "ought implies can" (1781, 548). The
idea of longtermism is itself absurd, so it is not a surprise after all
that MacAskill is incapable of justifying it.

The recent work of Sergei Medvedev is a qualified source for disclosing
dimensions of violence in politics and culture under Putin. Medvedev
speaks not only as a scientific researcher but also as an eyewitness who
published his book The Return of the Russian Leviathan shortly ahead of
the current war (2020 in English; 2017 in Russian). The book describes
and analyses phenomena of violence on various levels. For Medvedev, [the
annexation of Crimea in 2014 means]{.underline} that [Russia's internal
orientation in favour of traditional values]{.underline} --- in Putin's
words, in favour of 'spiritual bonds' --[has]{.underline} now [turned
outwards]{.underline} and [a **new era of international conflict has
been opened**]{.underline}. Speaking for numerous observers, he notes:

> [For too long, we ignored the revanchist rhetoric of]{.underline}
> ‛[the Russian world]{.underline}'; and now that world has come to us
> in armored personnel carriers. (Medvedev 2020, 14).

Meeting the Russian world under Putin, however, does not only entail
look at a politics of new risk, heroism, and missionary traits. At the
same time, [we have to recognize the relevance of violence throughout
Putin's world. In]{.underline} the course of the war in
[Donbas]{.underline}, Medvedev emphasises under the heading ‛Jihad in
Donetsk' the analogy to fundamentalist movements in the Middle East in
order to unmask [the anti-Western, anti-globalist creed]{.underline} of
the leaders of the so-called Peoples Republics of Lugansk and Donetsk as
the mentality of a bandit state. As a result, a social and humanitarian
disaster [is unfolding under Russia's protection]{.underline} in the
Donbas "and **[violence is becoming a way of life]{.underline}**" (24).

Besides the problem of violence in Donbas, Medvedev introduces the
perspective of discussing the Russian way of life as a way of life full
of violence in a broader sense. Oriented towards the development of
Russia from 2012 to 2018, Medvedev extends his diagnosis of the Putin
regime and its military aggressions ('war for space') to several
subjects interwoven with violence: the war of symbols, the war for the
body, the war for memory (parts II, III, IV). Thus, [we are shown the
picture of a **radicalised society** where the degree of violence is
growing]{.underline}. As to the symbols, the parade on Victory Day, 9th
May, celebrates "a continual liturgy of ‛the Great Victory'", and the
military forces mobilised against Ukraine continue the victory parade
(77).

The [militarisation of the nation refers to]{.underline} "[a **phantom
pain after the collapse of the USSR**]{.underline}" [alluded to in
Putin's]{.underline} now well-known [remark of]{.underline} "[the
greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the twentieth century]{.underline}"
(95). This somewhat panicked attitude towards the threat of further loss
of importance seems to stem from unsolved problems concerning Russian
identity. [One issue is the ambivalence of Russia's self-image
vacillating between seeing itself as a country for Russians
and]{.underline} seeing itself as [a multi-national empire]{.underline}
(cf. 1.3 above). [Another]{.underline} running thread [relates to the
long-term perspective for the country **blocked by the authoritarian
model Putin stands for**]{.underline}. Putinism, with its propensity for
militant symbols in the context of its brute power politics, can be
interpreted in light of Carl Schmitt's conception of sovereignty.

For his political account, Medvedev refers to [Schmitt]{.underline}, who
famously [framed sovereignty as the ability to step outside the
boundaries of legalism and abstract law to declare a state of emergency.
He draws parallels with Putin's exemplary decisions over]{.underline}
the last years: [the repeal of the constitutional moratorium on
two]{.underline} presidential [terms; the severe repression in 2012 of
protestors against election fraud and Putin's]{.underline} presidential
[inauguration]{.underline} on Bolotnaya Square in Moscow; [the prison
sentence inflicted on]{.underline} members of the band [Pussy Riot in
2012. These]{.underline} actions [are in line with the violation of
accepted norms in the interest of the symbolic assertion of sovereignty
and with the]{.underline} '[state of emergency]{.underline}'. In
Medvedev's view, the annexation of Crimea and subsequent warfare
continues the authoritarian drift of the Russian state seen in the years
leading up to it. This time, though, [the Russian state **declares the
state of emergency in name of the Russian people against i**nternational
**law**]{.underline}. 41

Medvedev also expands the Schmittian theory to shed light on a typical
Russian sociocultural practice. He refers to the virile attitude to
present oneself as a "real lad" (patsan), able to put down or even
humiliate a possible enemy. [The gesture of showing no sign of weakness
is in conjunction with the **willingness to break the
law**]{.underline}, and it marks out a real man from a mere "nerd
('ordinary man')". [Putin's]{.underline} own [past]{.underline} in St.
Petersburg [resembles such a disposition and fits the image of a
**typical Russian disdain for rules and norms**]{.underline}: "In this
way [the logic of the backstreet bandit becomes the logic of Schmitt's
sovereign]{.underline} and the 'code' of the criminal underworld which
formulates contemporary Russian politics." (107)

[This]{.underline} sociocultural diagnosis [corresponds with further
dimensions of violence under the heading of a]{.underline} "**[war for
the body]{.underline}**". A few indications will suffice here: a
[demographic policy]{.underline} is aimed at [pushing up the Russian
birth rate]{.underline} (120) [in accordance with an ideal of a normal
family]{.underline}, specifically a patriarchal family with four
children (136); [the]{.underline} Duma [proposed banning advertisements
for condoms]{.underline} outside specialised publications (128);
[homosexuality is banned]{.underline}, and **[homophobia becomes the
cultural code for anti-Western and anti-globalist beliefs, a
biopolitical creed with fascist analogies]{.underline}** (136). [What is
even more ubiquitous]{.underline}, however, [is the scandalous intensity
of violence against women]{.underline} which became a public issue in
2016 when thousands of women shared their memories of violence they had
suffered, e.g., rape, beatings, and more. As with humiliation and
discrimination in the army, these violent practices take place [under
the ruling patriarchal norm]{.underline}: the strongest lays down the
law and sets the hierarchy (141--143).

Medvedev sees the same code of the rule of the strongest, the unspoken
agreement based on violence and science, operating in politics. Thus,
politics and civil culture go hand in hand: The supposed 'natural right'
of man over woman is paralleled by the right of the state over the
citizens, reaching down to their body. Authorities are free to falsify
the results of elections, the police have no qualms about beating and
torturing suspects, the courts boldly mete out unjust sentences.
Finally, Russia callously moves to annex Crimea (143).

In arguing for a 'de-automatization of violence' by publicly announcing
pain and suppression as in the case of women who claimed their rights,
Medvedev leads us [to a grave problem which remains unsolved in Russia:
**the inability**]{.underline} "**[to speak about trauma]{.underline}**
--- [for example, about the legacy of Stalin's repression]{.underline}"
(144). [This can serve as keyword for the]{.underline} '[war for
memory]{.underline}' and its serious political consequences. [The burden
of de-Stalinization is crucial for the Russian national consciousness
which seems **unable to step out of the long shadows of
Stalinism**]{.underline}. Medvedev combines his diagnosis with an
instructive example worth citing in his own words:

> At the heart of our national consciousness, a black lacuna has formed,
> a sucking void, which the majority of people manage to skate around.
> But then occasionally bones rise to the surface, like on the bank of
> the Kolpashevo River near the Siberian city of Tomsk, where on 1 May
> 1979 the river Ob flooded and burst its banks, opening up a mass grave
> of victims who had been shot in 1937. Thousands well-preserved corpses
> were washed out; and the local authorities ordered that they be
> chopped up by the propellers of the river tugs and washed away.
> (209)42

[The obliviousness of the Russian nation to the traumas of the Stalinist
terror may be explained]{.underline} in part [by the constellation that
Stalinism was not ended by a brutal military defeat]{.underline} like
Nazism in Germany, [but was instead associated with a military
victory]{.underline}, seemingly **[justifying]{.underline}** the **[acts
of repression]{.underline}** committed **[despite their brutality and
the social disasters they brought about]{.underline}**. What is more,
[the regime is guided]{.underline} to this day [by a philosophy and
practice]{.underline}, with few changes or modifications,
[of]{.underline} "[chekism]{.underline}", which is still recognised
today (210). This nearly unbroken tradition of chekism, [alluding to the
Bolshevist secret police]{.underline} which subsequently became the KGB,
of which Putin was an officer, implies that **[there are no guarantees
that terror will not return]{.underline}**. 43 [The tradition of
violence distinctive of Stalinism has survived and shapes the national
consciousness]{.underline}.

This tradition finds its complement in the tradition of suffering as
elaborated in the work of Svetlana Alexievich, who won the Nobel Prize
for Literature in 2015. In her documentary prose, she reports the
stories of victims of political and social violence under Stalinism.
Thus, according to Medvedev, she succeeds in giving the trauma and
memory of Russia's terrifying 20th century a voice. She breaks the
"cultural convention of violence by the state and suffering by the
people, and the sanctification of the victim" (237). No wonder,
therefore, that the work of Alexievich is denounced by mainstream
Russian critics. At the same time, her work calls attention to the
silent acceptance of violence in the context of suffering. 44 This
points to the problem that the identities of the various perpetrators
under Stalinism (e.g., firing squads, investigators, denunciators, etc.)
were kept secret in the USSR after 1956 in exchange for the
rehabilitation of the victims. In light of incriminating evidence, only
about hundred people were found guilty in the time of Khrushchev,
whereas under Brezhnev and Gorbachev the trials were definitively
dismissed (238--239).

This result highlights the problem that [post-Soviet society has failed
to come to terms]{.underline} with [a critical assessment of the
**omnipresent**]{.underline} phenomena of [**violence in the Stalinist
past**. Stalinist violence was not only executed by state agencies and
the Bolshevist party but was also rooted in relevant parts of the
population]{.underline}. In a sense, state violence and violent society
should be seen in a complementary way (Gerlach and Werth 2009). [Going
into details of this constellation]{.underline} would mean initiating
memory processes in a far more elaborate way, to recollect concrete
events and comprehensively reveal the identities of perpetrators and
victims, irrespective of taboos. Evidently, such a course of action
[could only be successful within a political frame defined by standards
of historical responsibility. Instead, Putinism remains **firmly within
Stalinist traditions**]{.underline}, which means that [it resorts to
**suppressing the lawless and violent past**]{.underline}. At the same
time, [the Russian population seems]{.underline} once more
[motivated]{.underline} to a considerable degree [to **honour violent
means**]{.underline} in national and international politics. Thus, [the
political system correlates with socio-cultural dispositions and habits
internalised over generations]{.underline}.

Not surprisingly Medvedev demands to end the "shameful agreement between
the victims and the executioners" and to give priority to legal clarity
regarding Stalinism in the past and the political terror taking place
under Putinism (242). Evidently, [the war against Ukraine]{.underline}
since 24 February 2022 [postpones this postulate for a Russian life in
face of an unpredictable future]{.underline}. That is all the more
reason not to neglect the Russian origin of violence in the continuity
of Putinism and Stalinism.

4.3 The Spectre of Fascism?

The work of Medvedev as well as the previously described issue of
Russian imperial nationalism represent the task of facing Stalinism in
the interest of under- standing the present. This may be underlined by
the recent diagnosis of Nikolai Epplée:

> Thus, coming to terms with the memory of Soviet state terror is not
> pushed aside by the acute need to come to terms with the tragedy of
> today's victims; on the contrary, the two are directly related. [If
> the attack on Ukraine is]{.underline} deeply [motivated by the fact
> that the Russian leadership is **neither willing nor able to give up
> the** Soviet practices of governance and existence, the **imperial and
> colonial legacy of Stalinism**]{.underline}, then [the question of how
> to come to terms with this past is practically **the key problem that
> must be solved in order to suspend the causes of this war once and for
> all**]{.underline}. (Epplée 2023, 13; our translation)

Correspondingly, the problem of violence can be dealt with in a broader
perspective of research on Russia including history, literature, and
politics (Levitt and Novikov 2009). In our context, however, it seems
instructive to pay attention to historical research that inquires into
relations between Stalinism and Nazism, and which modifies and continues
earlier approaches to totalitarianism (e.g., Hannah Arendt). Thus,
besides studies of the political systems, their way of socialisation
(Vergesellschaftung), and the mutual entanglements of these regimes, we
learn of their similar propensity to violence. 45 What is more, we
cannot evade the insight that both systems represent strands of a
modernist development rooted in European history. Therefore, [simplistic
condemnations of]{.underline} these [systems as aberrations in the path
of modernity are **flawed**]{.underline}. Exemplary studies on the
Soviet-Stalinist development in terms of an 'experiment of modernity'
with its violent dimensions remain relevant (Plaggenborg 2006, Chs. 1,
4).

Looking to the present, the latest study of Medvedev, A War made in
Russia (2023), continues his interpretation of Russia as a violent
society in the dimensions already referred to, but also discusses
whether Russia under Putin can be characterised as a version of fascism.
Medvedev refers to Timothy Snyder's well-known thesis (2022), where he
declares Putin's regime 'fascist', but, at the same time, Medvedev
refrains from providing a clear identification with Snyder's thesis. On
the one hand, Medvedev points to [the regime's characteristics of
controlling the body, its cult of the dead and the cult of war as
**typical components of fascism** combined with genocidal tendencies to
**eliminate Ukrainian identity**]{.underline} ('de-Ukrainization'). On
the other hand, however, he rightly observes that [a key element of
fascism is missing: the ability to mobilise society]{.underline}.
Additionally, he remarks that the context for classical fascism was mass
industrialised society, while [Putinism is a result of post-Soviet,
post-industrial, and post-mass society marked by **demobilisation** and
**atomisation**]{.underline}. Whatever comparisons with other
manifestations of fascism may indicate, Medvedev sharpens the view on
the "unmistakably Russian" version which grew out of the decaying
Russian Modernity (Medvedev 2023, 27--31).

This way of framing the question of fascism is in the vein of pre-war
controversies concerning Russia, which were already focusing on the
problem of fascism. Thus, Marlene Laruelle discusses the question Is
Russia fascist? against the background of the widely agreed denominator
of fascism, namely the "utopian project of transformation that operates
by mobilising the masses around a promotion of violence" (Laruelle 2021,
145). Since a fascist mobilisation of society aims at the creation of a
new social order by harking back to a myth of regeneration and a cult of
violence, Laruelle denies that Putin's regime qualify as 'fascist', and
she criticises Snyder's thesis presented in a December 2016 lecture at
Yale University. Instead, she points to the conservative characteristics
of Putinism and the regime's ideological plurality (Ch. 8, 118--141; Ch.
5). This is not to deny fascist tendencies in the Russian Far Right or
Dugin's rehabilitation of fascist doctrine, but the influence of these
threads on Russian policy seems remote. Therefore, Laruelle proposes the
category of "illiberalism" for the Putin regime. This term is designed
not as the opposite of liberalism in the sense of anti-liberalism or
non-liberalism, but more as a kind of post-liberalism, "that is, as an
ideology that pushes back against liberalism after having experienced
it" (Laruelle 2021, 21).

Laruelle agrees the generic approach to fascism developed by Roger
Griffin and concurs with his judgment that Putin is rather a pragmatist
oriented towards Realpolitik, his expansionism notwithstanding. In
contrast, Snyder stands for an argument based on historical analogies.
To consider the pros and cons of both perspectives defines a range of
further research in light of the Russian war against Ukraine, including
revisions of former interpretations. For example, Laruelle's pre-war
analysis may be questioned with regard to her propensity to look at the
Russian state in a rather normalising way. She prefers arguments of
comparison between Putin's regime and Bonapartism (Napoleon III) as well
as the parallel to Berlusconism or her special proposal --- to Gaullism.
Of course, these compari- sons are qualified by differences, but the
course of her argument sounds inspired by reformist hopes that Putin may
be bypassed by reforms as in the case of De Gaulle (Laruelle 2021,
155--156). Thus, the category of illiberalism needs further reflection
in light of current events. 46

Returning to Medvedev and his suggestion of studying fascism in terms of
an "unmistakably Russian" version, we can add the polemical aspect of
speaking of fascism in view of Russia. As Laruelle (2021, 2) rightly
remarks, for the majority of the Russian population, "fascism"
represents the "ultimate evil". Thus, the use of a possible analytical
concept of fascism in light of Russian developments needs careful
reflection. This, of course, does not preclude siding with Medvedev in
diagnosing a somehow paradoxical repetition and reversal of history, in
light of the myth of the 'Great Patriotic War':

> History has come full circle and closed in on itself: those who
> defeated the Nazis have come a pathetic copy of them. Today, the true
> successors of 1941 to 1945 are not the Russian occupiers who have
> invaded a neighbouring country, but the Ukrainians, defending their
> own Motherland. (Medvedev 2023, 104)

In summary, [the challenge for the West consists]{.underline}, in a
sense, [in a historical constellation similar to the resistance to
Nazism during WW II**: to oppose a violent regime that defines itself by
adopting war as a national idea, by using war as a means for
self-affirmation and as an anchor for Russian identity, by conceiving
war as an end in itself**]{.underline} (Medvedev 2023, 152--161). **[The
question of violence in modernity remains a persistent
concern]{.underline}**.

#### Putin is a [textbook dictator]{.underline}, and evidence to the contrary is propaganda.

[Irredentism]{.underline}---[the romance of **reclaiming "unredeemed"
old lands**]{.underline}---[is a symptom of **messianic presidents and
premiers**, and **national paranoia and insecurity**]{.underline}.
Leaders demagogue about the recovery of ancient territories that
previously had weakened the nation's imperial grandeur and power.

[Supposedly long-scattered and oppressed peoples with
common]{.underline} linguistic, religious, and cultural [affinities are
recombined]{.underline}---usually [by **violently
overthrowing**]{.underline} their contemporary [**governments** and
**forcing them into a new ethnic super state**]{.underline}. Yet
irredentism is often a one-way street. Supposedly homeless
expatriates---the Greeks of Constantinople, Italians in Malta, Germans
in the Sudetenland, Serbs in Bosnia, and Russians in Ukraine---are said
to be even more zealous nationalists than their kindred in the
motherland. But just as often the territory to be reunited in a grand
imperial scheme can be more reluctant than the would-be uniter.

Early 20th-century Greek romantics fancied resurrecting the old Μεγάλη
Ιδέα or "Great Idea." That was the dreamy recreation of a panhellenic
Eastern Mediterranean. The New Byzantium was to be ringed by
Greek-speakers in the motherland, Asia Minor, the Aegean Islands,
Cyprus, and northern Egypt.

Yet, like most irredentists, the Greeks never had the manpower or
material wherewithal to reestablish such a modern Byzantine Empire. The
restored 15th century image rested entirely on the opportunistic
implosion of the Ottoman Empire, the 1918 defeat of the Central Powers,
especially in Asia Minor, the Middle East, and the Balkans, the
international chaos following World War I---and the pledges of the
victorious allies.

But soon a new Turkish secular government emerged to undermine the
quixotic Greek effort. The Great Idea's British sponsors betrayed the
project. It ended tragically with thousands of stranded Greeks savagely
butchered throughout Asian Minor.

Pre-Putins

Italian fascist dictator Benito [Mussolini had wilder
dreams]{.underline} in the 1920s and '30s [of recreating the Roman
Empire. In his irredentist fantasies, anywhere Italian was
spoken]{.underline}---[or where Latin once had
been]{.underline}---[there would follow the new Italian
empire]{.underline}. Mussolini discounted the wide-scale poverty in
southern Italy and Sicily and endlessly harangued about the fetters of
British Suez and Gibraltar that unfairly had boxed in the new Rome.

Mussolini's Mare Nostrum---"Our Sea"---would at least remake the
Mediterranean into an Italian lake. A reborn Rome would be flanked by an
Italian-speaking southern Europe, an Italian North and East Africa, an
Italian Aegean, and an Italian Dalmatia and Balkans.

Mussolini could only achieve his dreams through a host of "ifs"---if
France and Britain appeased him, if their Mediterranean navies
disappeared or would not fight, if Nazi Germany threatened Mussolini's
common enemies, if the so-called international community, like the
League of Nations, failed to deter him, and if ultimately Germany won
World War II.

So, Mussolini sequentially grabbed Ethiopia, expanded out from his
Libyan colonies, invaded Egypt, Albania, and Greece---until finally
Britain and America destroyed Mussolini and his fascist fantasies.

Adolf Hitler was the 20th century's most ambitious and most barbaric
irredentist. He came to power by screaming about a drawn-and-quartered
German Reich, carved up by the Versailles Treaty, with millions of
German speakers and lands scattered and lost to his native Austria, to
Poland, to France, and to Czechoslovakia. In Hitler's mind, these were
all "unredeemed" lands that he alone in his genius would reclaim for the
German Volk. He even included the ancient Volga Germans in the distant
domains of the Soviet Union as legitimate claimants on a new Third
Reich.

Unlike Italy, [Hitler had the military, the economy, and the
population]{.underline} for a brief moment [to bully his way into
reclaiming almost every German-speaking minority in Europe and blowing
up the borders of the continent]{.underline}. Finally, Hitler engulfed
the world in a war that cost 70 million dead, by invading all of Europe,
the Soviet Union, North Africa and encouraging Japan to do the same in
Asia and the Pacific. By 1941, the expanded Third Reich numbered over 80
million Germans. It had obliterated Poland and Czechoslovakia. And
Berlin ruled over an area larger in population and territory than the
current European Union. Only Britain was left to be destroyed.

But in truth Germany had already overreached, drunk on easy victories
and blind to the resources and manpower of his new enemies, the Soviet
Union, and the United States. By 1944, the United States alone had
produced a military larger than all the Axis militaries combined, a GDP
larger than those of all the combatants, friend and foe put together,
and a navy larger than all the aggregate navies of the world.

When the wreckage of the war cleared, Hitler's dream was a satanic
irony, as millions of Germans were dead, and millions more expelled from
once annexed nations and forced to walk back into a vastly shrunken
Germany.

With the 1990s breakup of the former Yugoslavia, Serbian strongman
Slobodan Milošević dreamed of a new Greater Serbia. He sought to force
neighboring Montenegro, Northern Albania, Bosnia, and Herzegovina into a
new version of the 14th century Serbian Empire. Serbia's near
decade-long modern Balkan Wars cost 140,000 dead, earned global
denunciation of Serbia, made Milošević a hated pariah, and ended with
the independence of all his would-be new conquests.

A Woke West?

[**Putin is history's most recent and first nuclear irredentist**. He
believes **any group of Russian speakers anywhere, or former residents
of imperial Russia or the Soviet Union, or Russian orthodox worshipers,
all belong to Putin's new Russian Empire**. Even if Russian speakers are
independent or happy as minorities]{.underline} in other countries,
[Putin has a **grandiose plan** to force them into his new mother
Russia]{.underline}.

Only that way can a huge new Russia of 270-300 million people, with a
vast area comparable to the old Soviet Union, become again a player on
the superpower stage to rival China and the United States.

[In Putin's mind, he has already forced **Georgia, Crimea**, and
**Eastern Ukraine** back into the Russian fold. Many]{.underline} of the
[old Soviet Republics are]{.underline} already [his **de facto
satellites** or puppets]{.underline}. If he can get back all of Ukraine,
the crown jewel of the old Soviet Union and Mother Russia---41 million
people, 230,000 square miles of territory, the best farmland in Europe,
rich in oil and minerals---Putin feels he would achieve his irredentist
goal. The remaining few lost Russian territories then will either be
easily absorbed, or their puppet governments will obey Russian orders.
Then, he believes, the former Warsaw Pact nations, in terror, will
supposedly shed their NATO alliance or at least become no-fly-zones.

Putin may have initially underestimated the Ukrainian heroic resistance.
He foolishly discounted any chance of NATO defiance. He had no idea how
much the supposedly decadent West still controls the levers and wheels
of the international financial and commercial system now directed at
Russia. He was clueless that new weapons such as cheap drone planes and
improved model Javelins and Stingers put into the hands of relative
amateur shooters could allow them to blow up multimillion-dollar tanks,
and huge trucks full of soldiers---all with a good chance of the shooter
escaping with his life, and the destruction videoed for global social
media consumption.

Now shamed by prior inaction, emboldened by the unexpected Ukrainian
resistance, and egged on by the Churchillian emergence of Volodymyr
Zelenskyy, European Union countries like Germany have suddenly all but
apologized for their former appeasement, nihilist cutbacks of oil and
gas production, and virtual disarmament.

In the United States, the public is ebullient at the scenes of defiant
Ukrainians and hopeful that Putin has at last met his irredentist
Waterloo. The point is not that Putin is stopped for good but that in
theory he could be stopped. And that is something, given the odds
against the Ukrainians and the declinist postmodern West.

In truth, Ukraine is vastly outnumbered, out equipped, and outmanned. It
was armed by the West far too late. It should have received tens of
thousands of anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles months ago. Last
summer, the United States should have increased daily oil and gas
output, not cut it back. The EastMed pipeline into Italy should have had
the full support of the Biden Administration. Joe Biden should have
stopped with the gratuitous "killer" and "bully" Corn Pop rhetoric,
spoken softly, and instead upped targeted defense spending and stopped
the commissariatization of the Pentagon. Ukraine should have kept out of
U.S. politics and impeachment psychodramas---and especially kept clear
of the toxic Biden family grifting syndicate.

But for now, all those "shoulds" and "coulds" must be considered after
[Putin]{.underline} is stopped. He [believes he can and will eventually
swallow Ukraine, **regardless of the costs in Russian blood and treasure
or the barbaric killing of innocent Ukrainian civilians**. He has
pivoted from the failed "easy" Georgia-Crimea model to the **messy
Chechnya fallback plan**]{.underline}---**[and]{.underline}** thus **[is
going medieval in Ukraine]{.underline}**.

Worse still, [Putin thinks he still can win ugly]{.underline}---maybe
even **[the uglier the better]{.underline}**. Then months from now a
supposedly galvanized West will fear him even more and remember even
less the fate of Ukraine. He assumes Europeans will pivot back and only
recall that by hook or crook the Napoleonic Putin had swallowed
Ukraine---and in the future could do the same anywhere he wished in his
neighborhood.

The leaders of the European Union and NATO are now giving Churchillian
speeches. They promise to retract their prior green nihilism. They
pledge to pump oil and extract more natural gas. They claim they are
through with the appeasing Nord Stream 2 pipeline. They say they will
now welcome a Greek-Cypriot-Israeli EastMed pipeline into southern
Europe. They soar in rhetoric about a new NATO armed to the teeth by
Europeans, shocked by the fate of Ukraine.

Let us pray this is all true.

### Russia Bad\-\--AT: Defensive

#### Russia only understands [strength]{.underline}\-\--they will [never]{.underline} uphold peace agreements, and the notion that we 'provoke' their crimes against humanity is [wrong]{.underline} and [unethical]{.underline}. 

Anders **Åslund 22**, Resident Senior Fellow in the Eurasia Center at
the Atlantic Council, Ph.D. from the University of Oxford, "Western
advocates of appeasement need a crash course in Putinology," Atlantic
Council, 05-15-2022, accessed 07-24-2025,

DG

The war in Ukraine has exposed the fundamental failure of Western
audiences to appreciate the true nature of modern Russia. Many
international [observers still]{.underline} assume Russia is a rational
actor and [believe]{.underline} policies of [appeasement can
bring]{.underline} the conflict in [Ukraine to an end. **Nothing could
be further from the truth**]{.underline}.

In reality, neither bleeding heart liberals nor diehard realists truly
understand Vladimir Putin. They fail to recognize that he [is an
authoritarian kleptocrat who does not care about Russia's national
interest]{.underline} and is focused instead on his power and wealth.
[He hides]{.underline} this [**self-interest** behind]{.underline} a
façade of [revisionist Russian nationalism]{.underline} that helps
secure popular support for his criminal rule.

As I have argued in my book, "Russia's Crony Capitalism: The Path from
Market Economy to Kleptocracy," Putin's personal politics combine
authoritarianism and kleptocracy. [He needs war]{.underline} not to make
Russia great again but [to increase his popularity and
justify]{.underline} his [repressive domestic policies]{.underline}.
Putin also fears the rise of a democratic Ukraine and views the
country's Euro-Atlantic integration as an existential threat to his own
authoritarian regime.

Understanding Putin is the key to forming effective Western policies
toward Russia and Ukraine. Ukrainians tend to understand Putin very well
but surprisingly few Westerners do. A number of common misconceptions
need to be addressed and debunked if the West wishes to get Russia
right.

One key problem when dealing with Putin is the Western fear of
escalation. The Russian dictator is well aware of this and always
escalates until he has won or been defeated. [The West must]{.underline}
therefore [**not seek to avoid escalation**, but should demonstrate a
readiness to **escalate more** and **faster**. This is the **only way**
to ensure]{.underline} that [**Putin fails** and **Ukraine
wins**]{.underline}.

Western [fears of]{.underline} "[provoking Putin]{.underline}"
[are]{.underline} particularly **[unhelpful]{.underline}**. For this
reason, US President Barack Obama refused to deliver lethal weapons to
Ukraine. Members of the current US administration appear to embrace the
same flawed idea. Meanwhile, similar arguments dominate the debate in
Europe and fuel a mood of [excessive caution]{.underline} that **[only
serves to embolden Putin]{.underline}**.

It is difficult to see any logic in these concerns. [Putin]{.underline}
has [started an **unprovoked** and **unjustified war**]{.underline}, but
it is the West that must not provoke him? [Such thinking is]{.underline}
essentially [a call to **allow a Russian victory** and **accept
Ukrainian defeat**]{.underline}. Instead, [the word]{.underline}
"**[provocation]{.underline}**" [should be retired from the]{.underline}
Western [discussion]{.underline} about Putin.

A similarly gentlemanly idea is the notion that the West must allow
[Putin]{.underline} to save face. Really? Putin is no gentleman. He
[wages wars of aggression and ruthlessly orders the destruction
of]{.underline} entire [cities. The West **cannot compromise over crimes
against humanity**]{.underline} on this scale. On the contrary, **[Putin
must be defeated]{.underline}**. [The only language he understands is
the language of **overwhelming strength**]{.underline}.

Many misguided Western politicians and commentators continue to call on
Ukraine to negotiate with Putin. The problem with this position is that
Putin himself has consistently refused to meet, negotiate, or even speak
on the phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

[Putin has]{.underline} also [demonstrated **conclusively**]{.underline}
that **[his word has no value]{.underline}** and [he feels]{.underline}
under [**no obligation** to keep]{.underline} any of his
**[promises]{.underline}**. For decades, [Putin]{.underline} has
[routinely violated international agreement after agreement while
publicly defending his conduct with **bare-faced lies**]{.underline} and
obviously implausible denials. Why bother to conclude another worthless
agreement with this lawless character?

Western calls for Ukrainian neutrality are similarly futile. Ukraine has
been neutral throughout its thirty years of independence and has never
had any serious prospects of joining NATO. Far from fearing Ukraine's
NATO integration, Putin invaded the country precisely because it was not
a NATO member and had not received sufficient military support from the
alliance.

NATO membership remains the only credible security guarantee for
Ukraine. Finland and Sweden have drawn the obvious conclusion from
Russia's invasion and have now abandoned decades of neutrality. Ruling
out closer ties between NATO and Ukraine will only encourage further
Russian aggression in Ukraine and elsewhere.

When [advocates of appeasement]{.underline} run out of other arguments,
they tend to [call for an immediate ceasefire]{.underline}. While
seemingly sensible, [these appeals ignore Russia's **long record** of
treating ceasefire agreements as **opportunities to regroup** and
**prepare for new attacks**]{.underline}.

This trend was particularly prominent during the seven years of
simmering conflict in eastern Ukraine following the signing of the
second Minsk Accords [in]{.underline} February [2015]{.underline}.
[Russia **refused to adhere to the ceasefire terms**]{.underline} agreed
[in Minsk and regularly launched localized escalations]{.underline} to
suit Moscow's interests.

Peaceniks often declare that the West must avoid painting Putin into a
corner. Similarly, they warn against destabilizing Russia, but [it
is]{.underline} entirely [irrational to position Putin as a source of
stability when he is **clearly** the main destabilizing factor
in]{.underline} both [Europe and Russia itself]{.underline}. Where would
Europe be today if this twisted logic had been applied to Adolf Hitler?

Russia's war against Ukraine is the biggest geopolitical crisis for a
generation. It is entirely understandable that many international
observers are desperate to end the slaughter and believe a negotiated
peace is the best way to secure peace. However, such hopes are
shortsighted and fail to appreciate the character of the Putin regime.

[The only way to end the war]{.underline} conclusively [is via a
decisive Ukrainian victory]{.underline} that forces Russia to
acknowledge its defeat and sees Ukraine regain all the land it has lost
since 2014. [If a compromise peace allows Putin to hold]{.underline} on
to his latest [territorial gains]{.underline} in Ukraine**[, he will use
any pause in hostilities to prepare for the next stage in his campaign
to subjugate the]{.underline}** rest of the [**country**. If he wins the
war, Russian aggression will **inevitably expand** beyond]{.underline}
the borders of [Ukraine]{.underline}.

[Years of Western wishful thinking and concessions to the Kremlin have
**failed to prevent Putin's emergence** as the **greatest threat to
world peace**. It is now time to recognize the reality of modern Russia

[Russia's paranoia]{.underline} about spies and subversives predates
Putin. It both [derives from and helped foster a strategic
culture]{.underline} -- t[he Russian approach to viewing and managing
threats]{.underline}, whether real or imagined -- [in which its security
apparatus has traditionally focused inwards, **views the external world
as almost implacably hostile**, and that]{.underline}, as a consequence,
to quote Yaacov Falkov (2022), '[granted the]{.underline} \[[Russian
Intelligence Services]{.underline}\] [the most exalted position among
other Soviet strategic tools]{.underline}'. It was to
(counter)intelligence that Soviet leaders turned almost reflexively to
secure their positions throughout the 20th Century. [The revolution's
bloodiest butchers deployed the NKVD and the KGB to arrest and harass
the guilty and innocent alike in its hunt for the]{.underline} '[enemies
of the people]{.underline}' to secure the new order (Andrew and
Mitrokhin, 1999). During the USSR's 'Great Patriotic War' the infamous
'SMERSH' (a Russian portmanteau of 'death to spies') was brutally
enthusiastic about rooting out German spies in the Soviet Army, even
executing an estimated 30,000 returning prisoners of war (POWs) who, in
their paranoid view, could be Nazi Manchurian candidates once returned
to Stalin's ranks. [Even under the reformers]{.underline}, the
architects of late Cold War perestroika and glasnost, [the
system]{.underline} still [stifled deviation and dissent]{.underline}.
In 1986, just a few years before the collapse of the Soviet experiment,
[the KGB persisted in]{.underline} its traditional role of [targeting
those who deviated from the Politburo's line]{.underline}, which claimed
that the nuclear catastrophe dissipating from the exploded reactor at
Chernobyl was due to human error and not because of fundamental flaws in
the reactor's design (Falkov, 2022).

The strategic culture, the norms, mindsets, and institutional memories
that calcified during the Soviet years retreated, ever so slightly, with
the collapse of the empire. But [following]{.underline} what appeared to
be [the relative liberalisation of the 1990s]{.underline} and the heady
days of rampant unbridled criminal capitalism, where enterprise ran
riot, and when historians, critics, and the opposition had a little
space for dissent, [the screw]{.underline} again [tightened on civil
society and civil liberties. Swiftly closed again were the State's
archives to foreign or critical historians. **Long gone was the
optimism**]{.underline}, felt in some quarters, **[that there was the
possibility of a reckoning with the Soviet past, of Russia
cooperating]{.underline}** -- even occasionally aligning -- **[with
NATO's]{.underline}** Balkans deployments and democratic
**[norms]{.underline}**. By the turn of the millennium,
[Putin]{.underline}, ever the Chekist, and a custodian of this strategic
culture, [had created something new but also turned back the clock: a
form of state management akin to a feudal court, where **loyalty trumped
all, laws served the leadership**, and **intelligence identified and
rooted out subversives**]{.underline} (Galeotti, 2023). [The machinery
of intelligence]{.underline} once again [had a clear purpose: Protect
the Tsar]{.underline}.

Identifying the precise tipping point in Russia's descent into Putinist
autarchy is a matter of judgement. However, following the 1999 apartment
bombings and the second Chechen War, the room for dissent, be it
political or personal, was squeezed inexorably. This applied to
practically everyone. Spies who spoke out, accusing the regime of
complicity in the 1999 bombings and other outrages, and of being mired
in rampant corruption more generally, were assassinated, some rather
theatrically like former FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko who was
poisoned with Polonium-210 in London in 2006, which was 'probably
approved by Putin' according to British authorities (Gioe et al., 2019).
Politicians who questioned and investigated the bombings were murdered,
as were Sergei Yushenkov and Yuri Shchekochikhin in 2003. Serious
political challengers were also subjected to unrelenting intimidation
and violence. Boris Nemtsov was gunned down in the shadow of the Kremlin
in February 2015. Putin's most potent political threat, the campaigner
Alexey Navalny survived an attempted assassination in 2020 but died in
February 2024 while languishing in Putin's gulag, his funeral becoming a
contested locus of protest.

[For Putin, the definition of a traitor encompassed far more than
turncoat]{.underline} as [**he conflates** independence or **criticality
with subversion and disloyalty**]{.underline}. The natural corollary of
this is that [**all dissent is a threat**, a potential nucleus for an
alternative node of political power]{.underline} -- [and]{.underline}
therefore [a matter for his counterintelligence service to address.
Matters for the attention of the intelligence services have]{.underline}
therefore [included politicians who would not come to heel, but also
journalists, the business elite, and the notion of an independent civil
society. Those who braved the risks of challenging the government's
line]{.underline} on all manner of topics [have been abused and
worse]{.underline}. Most famously, investigative journalist Anna
Politkovskaya, who was shot on Putin's birthday in 2006 after accusing
Putin of building a police state (Filipov, 2017). R[ecalcitrant
oligarchs]{.underline}, like Mikhail Khodorkovsky, [were exiled, brought
to heel or assassinated]{.underline} (Leonard, 2016). In 2021 Freedom
House (2021), the pro-democracy advocacy group, in its annual Freedom in
the World survey scored Russia dismally: 5/40 for political rights,
15/60 for civil liberties, overall judging it to be 'Not Free'. [Putin's
challengers have **all been marginalised**, not infrequently in a
**bloody manner**, at the hands of his intelligence community. Putin's
tactics may be more modern than his predecessors, but he is cut from the
same cloth, steeped in a strategic culture that stresses the existence
of an **ongoing western war against the besieged fortress that is
Russia**]{.underline} (Falkov, 2022).

### Russia Bad\-\--AT: Defensive\-\--Liberal Order

#### Russia doesn't care about recognition by the liberal order nor are they interested in signals of U.S. good faith.

https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/myths-warp-how-america-sees-russia-and-vice-versa

In Russia, it is conventional wisdom that the United States is
power-mad. [The American public]{.underline}, many [Russians believe, is
under the thumb of a **megalomaniacal** U.S. elite. Enthusiasm for a
liberal international order gets **little traction** in
Russia]{.underline} not because all Russians are realists but [because
their mythic view of the United States reduces the liberal]{.underline}
international [order to a **vehicle of American ambition**]{.underline}.
Many Russians are convinced that U.S. leaders' references to a
supranational web of norms, laws, and partnerships are merely
smokescreens for the cooptation that lies at the core of American
foreign policy.

[The reigning Russian myth is of Soviet vintage. According to this
myth]{.underline}, during the Cold War, [American capitalist elites
wanted to **run the world**]{.underline} and found innumerable military
pretexts to exert their wishes. The nightmare purportedly began after
World War II, when the United States rewired the political codes in
Japan and Germany, pushed those countries into alliances dominated by
the United States, used them as staging grounds for U.S. military
operations, and compelled them to serve as cheerleaders for the U.S.
national interest. To keep up, the Soviet Union had to build a bulwark
of "friendly countries" in Eastern Europe and establish its own global
footprint, lest the perfidious United States advance uncontested.

The United States' global influence during this era was real. But the
[Soviet characterization]{.underline} was a caricature---and one that
[proved **enduring**]{.underline}. Even after the Cold War ended,
[according to the Russian myth, the **U**nited **S**tates kept
**seducing**]{.underline} others with false rhetoric, including
**[Russia's neighbors]{.underline}**---countries such as Poland,
Romania, and the Baltic states. In this telling, U.S. allies operate
more as instruments of American power than as independent states. Where
governments resisted---in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Serbia, and Syria,
as well as in Ukraine before the 2014 Maidan uprising---[regime change
has been the American preference]{.underline}. Hegemony by invitation,
[**heg**emony **at the barrel of gun**]{.underline}: the means may vary,
but the end is never in question.

[Moscow]{.underline} has paid a high price for holding onto this myth.
It has [obligated itself to **contend with the American monster** even
at the expense of becoming more dependent on China]{.underline}. The
EU's Eastern Partnership program, which led to Ukraine's Maidan
uprising, was an authentic expression of idealism about the country's
European future, not a covert exercise of American hegemony. But the
contention that the CIA had staged a coup in Ukraine was a lie that
Russians had long been primed to believe. [Even if Russia's **top
leaders knew this** claim **was false**]{.underline}, their [public
insistence on it **closed off moderate responses**]{.underline} (such as
accommodating the new government in Kyiv) [and made more extreme
options]{.underline} (such as annexing Crimea) seem
**[necessary]{.underline}**.

In general, [the myth of a **U**nited **S**tates drunk on power and
unwilling to stick to agreements makes it very **hard for Moscow to
negotiate** over regional questions]{.underline}. [Russians cannot
imagine]{.underline} that the [leaders of countries such as Ukraine
**have minds of their own**]{.underline}. For Moscow, Ukrainian
hostility is simply the veiled extension of American hostility, and
American hostility toward Russia demands equal Russian hostility toward
the United States. If the only language the United States understands is
power, then negotiation, deliberation, and the granting of concessions
all entail undue risk.

the consequences," EUIdeas, 07-11-2022,
https://euideas.eui.eu/2022/07/11/john-mearsheimers-lecture-on-ukraine-why-he-is-wrong-and-what-are-the-consequences

On 16 June 2022, John Mearsheimer, Professor at the University of
Chicago, delivered a lecture on the war in Ukraine at the Robert Schuman
Centre of the European University Institute. During [the]{.underline}
lecture, Mearsheimer defended his controversial [view that Russia's
invasion of Ukraine is the fault of the **U**nited **S**tates and
NATO]{.underline}. For scholars studying Central and Eastern Europe and
the region's citizens, the lecture [is **deeply
problematic**]{.underline} on factual, scientific, and moral grounds.
This article addresses the validity of Mearsheimer's central thesis, the
quality of the presented evidence, and the lecture's broader
implications and the concept of academics' social responsibility. It
argues that Mearsheimer's explanation of the war in Ukraine is
intellectually unsatisfactory and that it rests on shaky empirical
foundations. [By publicly defending his]{.underline} scientifically
[unsound thesis, **Mearsheimer legitimises Russia's propaganda** and
**violates the fundamental values of social
responsibility**]{.underline} that **[all academics should
respect]{.underline}**.

A controversial thesis

Mearsheimer's main point is that the United Statesand its allies are to
blame for Russia's invasion of Ukraine since they allegedly pushed for
Ukraine's NATO membership, the prospect of which Russia has seen as an
existential threat. There are at least four reasons why this account is
wanting.

First, it ignores the fact that [Ukrainians]{.underline} -- like other
Eastern Europeans -- [have been actively seeking NATO membership to
protect themselves]{.underline} from the Russian threat. [They did not
need to be pushed]{.underline}, they have desperately wanted to join.
They first officially applied for membership in 2008 and repeatedly
declared it a policy priority after 2014. However, in Mearsheimer's
account, Ukrainians appear only as victims of Russia's invasion,
deprived of any agency. [Ascribing to them a uniquely passive role is
an]{.underline} analytical shortcoming that turns the blame game on its
head, and an [illustration of how **condescendingly**]{.underline} some
[Western academics and pundits regard Central and Eastern Europeans: as
**clueless pawns** in a]{.underline} geopolitical [game played
by]{.underline} the "[great]{.underline}" [powers]{.underline}.

Second, Mearsheimer's account is at least partially incomplete since, in
isolation, [it cannot]{.underline} satisfactorily [explain the
**timing** of the invasion or why other pro-Western countries in
Russia's immediate neighbourhood have avoided a similar
fate]{.underline}. When Russia's invasion started, it still appeared
extremely unlikely that Ukraine would join NATO in the foreseeable
future. What is more, the prospect that NATO, in the implausible
scenario of Ukrainian membership, would launch an attack against a
nuclear power is foolish. Indeed, Ukraine joining NATO would hardly be a
credible military threat to Russia and, if Crimea remained in Russian
hands, Russia's key strategic interests would be largely preserved. All
this suggests that [any serious explanation]{.underline} of the invasion
[needs to consider]{.underline} additional factors such as [Russia's
domestic political situation; the ideological and symbolic threat a
democratic and prosperous Ukraine would represent]{.underline} to
Russia's incumbent political regime; [and the potential desire of an
ageing dictator to conquer]{.underline} immortality [through territorial
expansion]{.underline}. Without considering these factors and assessing
them against solid empirical evidence, we will never understand what
triggered the invasion.

Third, Mearsheimer's explanation draws on his own version of the realist
theory of international relations, offensive realism, which is not an
overly reliable guide to the behaviour of contemporary states. Offensive
realism holds that great powers such as Russia cannot tolerate perceived
security threats in their neighbourhoods. However, here as elsewhere,
offensive realism often fails on empirical grounds. The breakup of the
Soviet Bloc, the post-Cold War military weakness of Germany, and peace
among major European powers are just a few examples of such failures.
Even if Russia really considered the prospect of Ukraine's accession to
NATO as an existential threat, which is far from certain despite
Russia's official rhetoric, there was absolutely no certainty that it
would react in the way it did to Ukraine's sovereign decision to seek
joining the alliance. It is not by accident that the invasion took many
members of Russia's political establishment by surprise. Given the
variety of alternative scenarios that could unfold, blaming the United
States, NATO, or even Ukraine -- if we acknowledge its active pursuit of
NATO membership -- for the war is not only morally wrong (i.e., wars are
always started by those who pull the trigger, not those who join a
defensive military alliance), but it is also intellectually
unsatisfactory.

Fourth, one would hope that such a controversial thesis would be borne
out by strong empirical evidence. Yet, the [evidence]{.underline}
presented during the lecture largely [boils down to an **uncritical
reading** of **selective official statements made by the Russian
leadership**]{.underline}. Furthermore, [the justification of the use of
this]{.underline} "[evidence]{.underline}", [referring to the **alleged
sincerity of Russia's president**, reveals further **cracks in the
cred**ibility **and scientific value of the** central
**argument**]{.underline}.

Weakness of the empirical evidence

Why should one believe what Russia's leaders say? "Because Putin rarely
lies to foreign audiences", claimed Mearsheimer. He went on to pre-empt
disagreements by reminding the lecture hall that he had authored a book
on lying in international politics, which finds that political leaders
lie to other countries much less often than we think. This attempt to
mute criticism regrettably failed to mention that the book is not based
on systematic research (page 12 of the book); that lying is rare
particularly for democracies like the United States (p. 13), which
Russia is not; and that the frequency of lying largely depends on the
definition of what lying is (p. 26), which is somewhat restrictive in
the book at hand. During his talk, Mearsheimer thus remained oblivious
to Russia's numerous lies on public record, including Putin's original
denial of any involvement in Crimea in 2014, which was followed by open
boasting about the annexation a few months later. The US Department of
State even went so far as to officially publish two 10-item lists of
documented Russia's falsehoods on Ukraine in 2014.

Mearsheimer's lack of critical scrutiny of Russia's statements contrasts
with his refusal to consider that Russia could have imperial ambitions
and that the invasion's objective could (also) be territorial. While he
was willing to take selected statements on the existential threat by
Putin at face value, he would accept the imperial motivation only if
somebody proved that Putin "thought it was a desirable goal, \[...\] a
feasible goal, \[...\] \[and\] that he intended to pursue that goal". It
is hard to imagine what kind of evidence Mearsheimer would like to see
as Putin has been quite clear in his repeated pre-invasion statements,
denying the legitimacy and even the very existence of the independent
Ukrainian state. On the eve of the invasion, Putin explicitly argued
that Ukraine never had "real statehood," and said it was an integral
part of Russia's "own history, culture, spiritual space." After the
invasion, he went on to compare himself to the 18th century Tsar, Peter
the Great, and to declare that Russia was simply reclaiming its
territory.

Engaging in curious intellectual gymnastics, Mearsheimer defended his
central thesis by claiming that while Putin's objectives escalated
during the invasion into imperial ambitions, Russia originally did not
want to annex territory before the invasion. Why? "Because there were
only 190,000 soldiers in Russia's invading army, which is far too small
a force to vanquish and occupy Ukraine". Yet again, this argument does
not hold much water when we remember that Russia clearly targeted Kiev
from the first day of the invasion and that it suffered terrible
military losses arguably due to poor intelligence. All available
evidence points to a disastrous miscalculation by the Kremlin leadership
consisting, among others, in a serious over-estimation of the
effectiveness of its own army, and of the popular support for Russia
within Ukraine. Russian may have assembled fewer troops than would be
normally necessary for controlling a country the size of Ukraine because
it expected little resistance. Its military operations were supposed to
be backed by a network of Ukrainian collaborators, most of whom,
however, may have existed only in reports prepared by Russia's security
officials. According to Ukrainian official sources, which certainly need
to be interpreted carefully in wartime, Putin discovered that his secret
services may have embezzled \$5 billion allocated from the Russian
budget for subversive operations in Ukraine between 2014 and 2022.

More generally, [denying the plausibility of Russia's imperial
objectives]{.underline} oddly [clashes with]{.underline} the core tenets
of Mearsheimer's own theory and a large amount of circumstantial
[**ev**idence]{.underline} from Central and Eastern Europe. Offensive
realism argues that great powers aim to maximise their material
capabilities. If Russian intelligence reports suggested Ukrainians would
not resists their invaders, why wouldn't Putin want to annex Ukraine's
territory? And why would his plans escalate from intervention to
annexation when the invasion did not go as planned, as Mearsheimer
claims? On the contrary, such escalation would have made much more sense
if the invasion had proceeded smoothly. By [questioning Russia's
imperial ambitions]{.underline}, Mearsheimer [turns a blind eye to the
nostalgia for the Soviet empire in Russian public opinion, the
persistence of a hierarchical and imperial worldview among Russian
elites]{.underline} and in the Russian media, [and Russia's meddling
in]{.underline} the politics of [Central European
countries]{.underline}. Moreover, in the months leading up to the
invasion, Russia required a Ukrainian pledge to not join NATO, but also
a NATO pledge to withdraw all troops from the territories of its
post-1990 members in Central and Eastern Europe. Clearly, Russia's
ambitions do not stop with Ukraine. That is fully in line with offensive
realism, but it runs counter to Mearsheimer's current thesis, which
implies that if the US did not push for Ukraine's NATO membership, there
would be no "crisis."

Consequences and academics' social responsibility

Mearsheimer's determined promotion of his controversial view is hard to
understand. Whether it is motivated by his attachment to the realist
theory, a taste for provocation, or even some proximity to Russia's
interests is hard to tell. Nevertheless, his account has limited
explanatory power and little scientific value. [It inter alia leads to
theoretical inconsistencies, relies on **cherry-picking** of **official
statements** made by a serial liar]{.underline} in international
relations, [**sets double standards** when assessing available evidence,
and uses **rhetorical gymnastics** to address unfavourable new
realities]{.underline}. What is enrobed in a scientific cloak is
punditry with far too serious real-life consequences. [It **plays into
the hands of Russian propaganda**, which the Kremlin does not hesitate
to instrumentalise]{.underline}. Mearsheimer clearly does not realise or
care how socially detrimental his questionable claims are.

While the right to express unpopular academic ideas needs to be
defended, their [authors are **responsible for the
consequences**]{.underline}. They should always weigh the strength of
the supporting evidence, the ideas' potential benefits to society, and
the likely repercussions of expressing them outside purely academic
circles. [When the evidence is weak, societal benefits are low, and the
repercussions are disastrous]{.underline} (such as legitimising a
criminal invasion), [academics should **choose a different
topic**]{.underline} for touring the world's lecture halls.

07-04-2023,
https://thehill.com/opinion/international/4079666-americas-leading-realist-keeps-getting-russia-wrong

John J. Mearsheimer, the University of Chicago's realist foreign policy
guru, published his latest analysis of the Russian-Ukrainian War on a
historic day: June 23, when Russia was roiled by a failed putsch led by
the Wagner Group's Yevgeny Prigozhin.

Just as Russian President Vladimir Putin's fate, as well as that of his
regime, hung in the balance, just as a successful coup could have
altered the course of the war, led to civil bloodshed and the possible
disintegration of the Russian Federation --- all scenarios invoked by
Putin in his address to the nation --- [Mearsheimer failed to give any
attention]{.underline} whatsoever [to Russia's **domestic politics**,
preferring to focus]{.underline} instead, as he always does, exclusively
[on the Russia state's relations with Ukraine and the West]{.underline}.

[This would be like ignoring domestic factors in the U.S. conduct of the
wars in Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan; French and British hopes for
appeasement]{.underline} in 1938; [the role of power struggles and
ideology in the Soviet decisions to invade, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and
Afghanistan]{.underline} --- [and]{.underline}, of course, [Putin's
**very personal decision** to launch a poorly planned all-out attack on
Ukraine in 2022]{.underline}.

Prigozhin's march on Moscow, though unsuccessful, revealed to Russians
and the world that the Russian state and regime are brittle, that Putin
is increasingly vulnerable, and that the proximate and ultimate outcome
of the war depends as much on what Russians do within their state as on
what they do to Ukrainians with their state.

[Mearsheimer's oversight is **no accident.** Domestic factors are
irrelevant to his theoretical model]{.underline}. That doesn't mean that
he has no insights to make that are worthy of attention; it does mean
that [his predictions and policy recommendations are **so utterly
divorced from anything resembling reality as to be wrong a
priori**]{.underline}.

Putin, for one, would agree. His fateful decision to invade Ukraine was
based exclusively on Mearsheimerian balance of power calculations.
Putin, like Mearsheimer, saw that Russia had a larger military, economy
and population than Ukraine. Naturally, it would win, and quickly --- a
view that many policymakers and analysts inspired by Mearsheimer's
realism also shared. Had America's Founding Fathers been realists of
Mearsheimer's ilk, they would never have dared to declare independence
from the reigning global superpower in 1776.

Unsurprisingly, although Mearsheimer's lengthy paper has 68 endnotes,
not a single one references a Russian- or Ukrainian-language source.
Given such limitations, [Mearsheimer cannot access the views of real
Russians or Ukrainians on the left, right, and center]{.underline} ---
[who might have alerted him to the brittleness of the regime and the
weakness of Putin]{.underline} --- [and must]{.underline} therefore
[rely on and take at face value the foreign-policy statements of Russian
leaders and their propagandists]{.underline}.

[There is]{.underline}, after all, [**no other way** to buttress his
claims about Russia's supposed fear of NATO and the West. Russian- and
Ukrainian-language sources]{.underline}, as well as Sovietologists and
post-Sovietologists, [might have reminded Mearsheimer that Russian
leaders habitually engage in **mendacity**, a tradition that goes back
at least as far as]{.underline} Vladimir [Lenin, who promised to
liberate non-Russians and instead imposed a colonial yoke on
them]{.underline}.

[Putin and his comrades]{.underline} see Nazis where there aren't any:
Ukraine. They [see militarization **where there isn't
any**]{.underline}: ditto. They insisted in late 2021 and early 2022
that they would never, ever invade Ukraine --- and then did. [They
deny]{.underline}, still, [targeting Ukrainian civilian
targets]{.underline}. They deny, still, having destroyed the Kakhovka
dam. The list could go on ad infinitum.

[And yet]{.underline}, bizarrely, [when Russians say they
fear]{.underline} Ukrainian membership in [NATO and U.S. nuclear
weapons]{.underline} on Ukraine's eastern border, [Mearsheimer believes
them, when he should be asking]{.underline} himself [whether
such]{.underline} ostensible [fears have **any grounding in reality**
and what the real reasons might be]{.underline}.

I've made these points many times. For starters, **[absolutely no
one]{.underline}**, including the Russians and Ukrainians, [expected
Ukraine to become a NATO member for]{.underline} at least **[20
years]{.underline}**. And [in 2014]{.underline}, the year the war
actually began, [there was no talk of Ukraine's joining]{.underline}, by
either the Ukrainians, the West or the Russians. Ukraine didn't matter
to the West's perceptions of its security. In contrast, [Ukraine
mattered to Russian perceptions]{.underline}, not because of any actual
military threat --- Ukraine had some 6,000 battle-ready troops in 2014
--- [but because of the ideological threat the democratic Maidan
Revolution posed to Putin's claims to be a legitimate
autocrat]{.underline}.

Obviously, official Russian statements would never admit to such an
interpretation. Russian-language analysts, and their Ukrainian
counterparts, could easily have briefed Mearsheimer and helped correct
his myopia.

Mearsheimer notes in his analysis that, "I am attempting to predict the
future, which is not easy to do, given that we live in an uncertain
world. Thus, I am not arguing that I have the truth; in fact, some of my
claims may be proved wrong."

Indeed, he doesn't, and indeed, they will.

This line of effort seeks to portray any viable replacement for Putin as
less rational and more aggressive. It is based on the Kremlin's twin
assumptions that the West's objective is to seed color revolution and
regime change in Russia and that Russia's strategic defeat in Ukraine
may threaten Putin's domestic hold on power.

Though the concept of 'strategic defeat' is not clearly defined, [Putin
portrays regime change and Russia's collapse as the West's final
goal]{.underline} in the current war.67 Consequently, [much of the
Kremlin's cognitive warfare output targeting the Western public and
policymakers aims to **grow fear** and **uncertainty** over]{.underline}
the nature of [a post-Putin Russia and portray Putin as the least bad
option]{.underline} for the West. [These]{.underline} efforts [amplify
pre-existing fears of regime collapse]{.underline} or civil turmoil in
Russia among some Western policymakers, and what this could mean for the
security of Russia's nuclear arsenal, coupled with the notion that
Russian defeat in Ukraine is likely to result in Putin being replaced.68
[The Kremlin frequently bolsters this]{.underline} narrative [by having
**figures other than Putin**]{.underline} (such as popular TV hosts or
politicians) **[seed the most extreme nuclear threats, which Putin
himself subsequently walks back]{.underline}**, giving him an image of
relative calm and rationality. For example, when questioned following
Sergey Karaganov's inflammatory article calling for Russia to engage in
preemptive nuclear strikes, Putin responded: 'I reject this \[idea\]. .
. . First, we see no need to use it \[nuclear strikes\]; and second,
considering this, even as a possibility, factors into lowering the
threshold for the use of such weapons'.69 This narrative was again
overtly referenced by Dmitry Medvedev during the civil turmoil
associated with the Wagner mutiny in June 2023, stating 'We will not let
events develop according to a scenario in which nuclear weapons end up
in the hands of \[Wagner\] bandits --- however much the \[Wagner\]
criminals who have lost their minds want this'.70 In fact, Yevgeny
Prigozhin had previously explicitly indicated his disapproval of nuclear
weapons use in Ukraine, stating in May 2023: 'We started this fight.
\[The Ukrainians\] were neighbours . . . a nuclear bomb is like \[an\]
axe. You shouldn't run after your neighbour with an axe. Better to do it
honestly: either beat him or admit that he beat you. The place to prove
you're right is on the battlefield'.71

[These lines of effort are **designed to convince Western policymakers
to minimize support** for Ukraine, lest Ukrainian]{.underline}
'catastrophic [success]{.underline}' result in a [collapse]{.underline}
of [Putin's regime]{.underline} and his replacement by a more escalatory
figure. **[In reality]{.underline}**, from our perspective, [Putin's
loss of power in Russia is more likely to result in a **collapse of
Russia's war effort** in Ukraine **than a nuclear escalation**. Putin's
encouragement of competing power factions]{.underline} seeking his
approval [means]{.underline} that [whichever]{.underline} individual or
[faction gains power after Putin will likely be consumed with the need
to consolidate]{.underline} domestic [power by overcoming adversary
factions]{.underline}.72 Accomplishing [this]{.underline} objective [is
contra-indicated with **squandering military resources in Ukraine, or by
starting an external nuclear war**. Historical precedents bear this out:
civil turmoil]{.underline} in the 1905 and 1917 Russian revolutions, and
the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, all [amplified by humiliating
external military defeats]{.underline} (to Japan, the Central Powers,
and Afghanistan respectively), [resulted in an **inward turn rather than
an escalation of external conflicts**, as domestic stakeholders sought
to consolidate]{.underline} internal [control. This inward
turn]{.underline} (at least, over the short and medium term) [following
the collapses of the Russian Empire]{.underline} (1917) [and the Soviet
Union]{.underline} (1991) then [provided opportunities for]{.underline}
many [colonized states]{.underline} of the Russian Empire and USSR [to
achieve independence]{.underline}.

[As for]{.underline} similar Western [fears around the security of
Russia's nuclear arsenal]{.underline} in a context of civil turmoil
following regime collapse, [historical precedent]{.underline} again
[shows a different outcome. **The Soviet Union did collapse in
1991**]{.underline}, while **[in possession of the largest nuclear
arsenal in the world]{.underline}**. Despite breaking up into multiple
independent states, [there was no]{.underline} large-scale [civil war
and no]{.underline} major [nuclear-related disasters]{.underline}. While
Washington and its allies did undertake a large-scale systematic effort
to ensure this transition and prevent proliferation, this
[effort]{.underline} was successful and [led to a **relative détente**
with Moscow]{.underline} in the 1990s and early 2000s. Nevertheless,
[pre-existing Western fears about]{.underline} the consequences of a
[Russian collapse remain]{.underline} one of the most [**potent** and
**effective propaganda**]{.underline} opportunities currently at [the
Kremlin's disposal]{.underline}, and [**disinfo**rmation alleging
Western plots to foment the break-up of the Russian Federation are
**regularly fostered by Putin and his close allies**]{.underline}.73

### Russia Bad\-\--AT: U.S. Bad Too

#### Pointing to U.S. moral failures is a [Putinist propaganda tactic]{.underline} designed to facilitate Russian imperialist aggression.

'Whataboutism' and Russia's War Against Ukraine," e-flux Notes,

These days, it is striking that [many]{.underline} people [in the West
are]{.underline} only [looking at the Russian invasion of Ukraine from
their **usual positions in the identity-politics
trenches**]{.underline}. As if nothing has changed in principle as a
result of this Russian war of aggression, if not extermination, against
Ukraine. I don't use the term "identity politics" with a negative
connotation here: for it seems identity-forming and at the same time
politically legitimate to stand up against Nazis and for the rights of
minorities, or against the fossil fuel industry and for climate
protection. But the war metaphor of the "trench" is nevertheless
appropriate, because it indicates that one is entrenched, that one's
field of vision is massively restricted, but that one is nevertheless
lashing out against opponents.

Many who hold anti-imperialist, anti-colonialist views say and write on
social media, "... but what about Yemen?!" (referring to the ongoing
brutal proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran); environmentalists are
outraged when the green German economy minister, Robert Habeck, buys
liquefied natural gas from authoritarian regimes in the Gulf; and
anti-fascists point to the Azov battalion of the Ukrainian army, which
was founded by right-wing radicals in 2014.

These are only three examples, but they are particularly pivotal ones:
for [here we are dealing with **imperialism** and **colonialism and
their consequences**, including]{.underline} the [proxy
wars]{.underline} caused by them [and the flight of
millions]{.underline} of people; with the threat to humanity of climate
catastrophe; and with a worldwide strengthening of far-right political
players in recent years. [It is]{.underline} all the more [important to
broaden]{.underline} these [perspectives if we are not to miss the new
quality of the war against Ukraine: not least in view of the **war
crimes and atrocities** that have already become known]{.underline},
such as the Bucha massacre.

In other words, the political framework of those who consider themselves
progressive might need some recalibration if it is to avoid getting
caught up in its own contradictions, or even worse: fail historically
and shamefully in the face of the demands of the present situation.
Because as writer and Holocaust survivor Eli Wiesel once said (in words
that are being quoted often on social media these days): "**[We must
take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence
encourages the tormentor, never the tormented]{.underline}**."

And this is the dismaying suspicion when the above viewpoints are
bluntly reproduced again today: that some are refraining from taking
sides.

This does not mean that the arguments put forward are simply invalidated
by the accusation of "whataboutism." It's a well-known phenomenon in
political debates these days, whether in physical space or social-media
space: someone promotes or protests against something, and someone else
comes along and wants to invalidate this as one-sided, unfair, or even
discriminatory by asking the reproachful counter-question: "But what
about ...?" What follows is a reference to another, historical or
current, allegedly or actually similar thing. The implication is clear:
that [there is a double standard]{.underline}, that the criticized
person has previously behaved tacitly or euphemistically and is
therefore now delegitimized. These objections often have a kernel of
truth. [But at the same time, the reproachful counter-question
is]{.underline} also [in danger of serving to **legitimize doing nothing
and remaining passive**. This is **fatal** in view of a war that has
already turned from being a war of aggression to one of
**annihilation**]{.underline}; a war [waged by a **dictatorially ruled
nuclear power against a sovereign, democratic neighboring state**. This
makes]{.underline} it all the more [important not to simply dismiss
"whataboutism"]{.underline} as such [and leave it unaddressed in terms
of argumentation]{.underline}. Rather, **[one must seriously examine the
accusation of double standards]{.underline}** that it almost always
implies. And [the best way]{.underline} to do this [is]{.underline}
usually [by listening to those]{.underline}---not least on Twitter and
elsewhere on the social media---[who know the ropes]{.underline}.

Take, for example, US historian of Russia and the Soviet Union Kimberly
St. Julian-Varnon, who recently summarized some key points about the
imperialism and colonialism of czarist Russia and the Soviet Union in a
widely followed Twitter thread.

It was immediately clear why: because she had now and again encountered
the viewpoint---whether implicitly or explicitly---that the concept of
imperialism could only be used and invoked with reference to Western
powers. [For Siberia]{.underline}, she notes, [**Russian settler
colonialism began as early as the sixteenth century**, with the aim of
displacing the indigenous population]{.underline}; in the nineteenth
century, [Russia overran the Caucasus with a series of bloody wars,
including genocidal ethnic cleansing of]{.underline}, for example, [the
Circassians; and]{.underline} already in czarist times, [the Ukrainian
language was massively suppressed]{.underline}, and [schools and
newspapers were closed]{.underline}. St. Julian-Varnon states that [the
czarist empire's expansion strategy had **all the characteristics of
imperial colonialism**: a policy of **violent settlement**, the
**suppression of minority languages** and beliefs, **deportations**, the
massive **exploitation and extraction of raw materials** in the
conquered territories. The only reason Russia did not participate in the
colonial division of Africa was because it **already had a huge colonial
empire**]{.underline}. According to St. Julian-Varnon, those who ignore
or conceal the proven and obvious negate the history of the oppression
of millions and millions of people.

Here it becomes clear that the double standard is not that Ukraine is
unjustly "favored" in the attention of world public opinion, but rather
that [many remain blind to the **aggressive colonial character** of this
war]{.underline}.

Theorist and curator Vasyl Cherepanyn, who runs the renowned Visual
Culture Research Center in Kyiv, said in a Zoom interview that the
discriminatory prioritization of certain refugees is the problem and the
privilege of the West. He insists that in the West's current readiness
to accept refugees also lies the "chance to change the entire refugee
situation," in the sense that Western countries can finally begin, in
the words of Hannah Arendt, to speak of "newcomers"---those newly
arrived---and no longer of refugees. In other words, people who are
making a new start, who are allowed self-determination and agency, and
who are not seen merely as passive people in need of help.

Cherepanyn also points out that all the invocations of solidarity and
aid will be in vain if there is no recognition that Ukraine also needs
significant military support in order to stand up to the Russian
assault. In May 2021, when Robert Habeck was still coleader of the
German Green Party (today he is the vice chancellor of Germany), he
demanded that defensive weapons be delivered to the Ukrainian army after
a visit with President Zelensky in Kyiv. This was met with harsh
criticism, especially from his own party, and he felt compelled to
specify that he had only meant night-vision goggles and mine-clearing
equipment.

At present, too, the Green vice chancellor and economy minister finds
himself in the position of having to do things that are far from
acceptable to the Green Party's core constituency. For example, he made
agreements with Qatar and the United Arab Emirates to supply Germany
with liquefied natural gas in order to gradually replace Russian gas.
This of course attracted the scorn of commentators: the fact that Habeck
shook hands with the Qatari industry minister and bowed politely in
greeting was, naturally, interpreted as servile groveling; and what
about the human rights violations committed by Gulf states? The implicit
accusation of double standards becomes absurd: you can't demand an
embargo against Russia and at the same time be surprised that an
industrialized country can't switch completely to renewable energy
overnight.

[The pattern that emerges with whataboutism amounts to **pulling a trump
card** and **imputing moral failure to the other side**. It provides
instant satisfaction to the accuser, who can]{.underline} then
[**cheaply stay out of realpolitik dilemmas**. Anyone who, in the face
of]{.underline} today's [Russian war of aggression and annihilation, can
only point out that]{.underline} the American invasion of
[Iraq]{.underline} in 2003 [was also]{.underline} an
[illegal]{.underline} war of aggression [runs the risk of **excusing one
injustice with another**]{.underline} (**[while reproducing an
argumentative strategy of the Putin government]{.underline}**). Yet the
current countermeasures should be treated as all the more urgent
precisely because of the historical precedents. And anyone who hasn't
had to think about how to change in a matter of weeks an energy policy
that was misguided for decades should refrain from mocking a green
economy minister who is forced to buy gas from the Gulf.

A third, notorious example of the "but what about ...?" approach to the
reality of this brutal war is to bring up the Ukrainian army's Azov
regiment, whose origins lie in a volunteer battalion formed by
right-wing radicals in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and war in the
Donbass began. Russian propaganda frequently invokes the Azov regiment
when it claims that today's war is about the "de-Nazification" of
Ukraine.

German journalist Alice Bota, who writes for the weekly Die Zeit and who
reported on events in the Donbass back in 2014, felt compelled to set
the record straight on Twitter.

She points out that volunteer militias are a problem for any democratic
state, especially if that state wants to maintain its monopoly on the
use of force; and she confirms that there are indeed Nazis in
Azov---"There is no point in playing it down," she writes. In recent
years, right-wing Ukrainian radicals have committed numerous hate crimes
against Roma and queer people.

But Bota also says that it is strange to talk so much about Azov now,
when [countless Russian war crimes are taking place]{.underline} at the
same time [under the banner of]{.underline} what historian Timothy
Snyder has aptly called "**[schizo-fascism]{.underline}**"---that is, [a
Russian-ethnic fascism that **constantly hurls the accusation of fascism
against anyone who dares to openly dissent**]{.underline} from its
ethnic vision, **[and that imprisons or kills opponents its own
territory and wages a full-on war against]{.underline}** a neighboring
country such as **[Ukraine]{.underline}**.

Bota adds that talking about Azov is a "distraction ... perhaps also a
form of conscience relief ... And so it settles: oh, the war is
complicated. Oh, somehow both sides are to blame." This pattern of
bothsidesism crops up again and again, as it is suitable for
trivialization and self-relief. As especially common variant since the
invasion of Ukraine is: "Nazis on both sides."

What remains? The need to state a few relatively simple truths in the
context of this war. First, [the evidence is overwhelming that Putin's
war is a criminal war of aggression, if not annihilation, **long planned
and with an imperialist agenda**. Active
solidarity]{.underline}---including tough economic sanctions and the
delivery of weapons to Ukraine---[must]{.underline} therefore [be shown
to those resisting this annihilation]{.underline}, namely Ukrainians.
Second, historical and present-day **[comparisons are illegitimate if
they seek to undermine this solidarity]{.underline}**; they are
legitimate if they help to understand the urgency of the current
situation. Third, it is necessary to help refugees. Vasyl Cherepanyn is
right when he denounces Europe's selective and discriminatory treatment
of refugee fleeing the fighting in Ukraine. In Germany, some journalists
murmur about a greater closeness to Ukrainians in the
"Christian-influenced cultural sphere," or they write in all
seriousness: "This time they are real refugees." Poland, which has
refused to accept refugees from Arabic-speaking countries in the past,
now rushes to the aid of Ukrainians. The categorization of refugees
according to racist patterns has to be stopped (such as when refugees of
color from Ukraine have been rejected or treated as second-class
refugees).

[Nor must the plight of Ukrainians be allowed to be
exploited]{.underline}---such as when German meat company Tönnies tried
to funnel refugees directly from the border into its scandal-ridden
sweatshop slaughterhouses, or when sex offenders known to the police
offered Ukrainian women and children places to sleep.It is a disgrace
for Europe that refugees are still being crammed into catastrophically
inhumane camps in Greece while illegal pushbacks in the Mediterranean,
which have already led to thousands of refugee deaths, continue.
However, the advantages that Ukrainians now enjoy in European countries
compared to Afghan refugees, for example, must not be used as an
argument to deprive them of help. On the contrary, these must become
reasons for European countries to implement a more humane refugee policy
overall. **[Injustice must not be played off against
injustice]{.underline}**---**[certainly not to legitimize one's own
inaction]{.underline}**.

## Cooperation Bad

### AT: Cooperation Good\-\--2NC

#### The Arctic shouldn't be a place for cooperation\-\--Russia has already shown they don't deserve it.

Institute of International Affairs, former Advisor in the Ministry for
Foreign Affairs of Finland, Deputy Director of the Defence and Security

However successful it has been in the past as a regional platform, [the
Arctic **should not be seen as**]{.underline} an exemption, let alone as
[**a region of peace and coop**eration, when]{.underline} the reality is
that [Russian actions have long been aimed at leveraging the Arctic as
part of hybrid threats against the West]{.underline}. 40 [Russia is
waging a **brutal war of aggression** against its neighbour]{.underline}
on the European continent, [including with troops and equipment drawn
from]{.underline} the Russian [Arctic garrison]{.underline}s. President
Vladimir [Putin]{.underline} has [stated publicly]{.underline} that [the
Arctic 7]{.underline} countries [are]{.underline} officially labelled as
'[unfriendly]{.underline}', meaning that they are seen as actors hostile
to the Russian state. This must be taken into consideration with the
Arctic Council, despite entrenched hesitancy to disturb the existing
diplomatic status quo.

[For Russia, Arctic **coop**eration is **of secondary importance**,
being more of a tool for **coercive diplomacy** and **support to its
hybrid threats**]{.underline}.41 [This includes weaponizing the
diplomatic norm]{.underline} that Arctic issues should be resolved first
through the Arctic Council---which explicitly excludes consideration of
military matters---and pressuring other Arctic states to block the
consensus-based NATO from taking a more formal institutional interest in
the region.42

[Western countries]{.underline}, on the other hand, [are supporting
Ukraine in accordance with the UN Charter and **i**nternational
**law**]{.underline}. Hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of civilian
aid and military equipment has flowed into Ukraine. 43 In an unexpected
repercussion, in terms of Russian ambitions in the European Arctic,
Finland and Sweden have joined NATO, driven by fear of Russia's
unpredictable leadership and its aspirations as a great power. 44
[Western cooperation with Russia in other bodies]{.underline} such as
the Barents Euro-Arctic Council [has been **suspended**]{.underline},
with the other member countries using Russia's exclusion as a chance to
push forward with initiatives that Russia might otherwise have blocked
or sought to manipulate and subvert for its own ends.

The continued cooperation within the framework of the Arctic Council is
therefore an anomaly that is difficult to explain or justify. [By
investing]{.underline} so much political and moral capital [in the
continuation of Arctic cooperation, western countries risk signalling to
Russia and other international audiences that stability in this region
is of such importance to them that they will continue working with
Russia even when the latter is **violating the rules-based order** and
**committing apparent war crimes** in Ukraine]{.underline}.45 [This
invites]{.underline} further [Russian provocations and threats against
the Council]{.underline}, seeking to test and stretch the limits of
western accommodation in the polar regions.

U.S. and has been defended by it. The basic premise of the American
system is that [countries cannot threaten, invade or otherwise overtake
the]{.underline} territorial [sovereignty of other countries. Russia
under Putin has **repeatedly flouted these rules**. It]{.underline} has
[invaded Georgia]{.underline}, it [engaged in brutal war crimes in
Chechnya, it invaded an annexed Crimea and it engaged in a full-scale
invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}. This is [not to mention]{.underline}
its [various interventions in]{.underline} parts of [Africa, the Middle

Some years ago, I had the chance to speak with one of America's great
spymasters, former Director of the National Security Agency (NSA) and
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director, General Mike Hayden. A young
political science student at Duquesne University, our shared alma mater,
I asked him about working with Moscow on counterterrorism operations.

Succinctly, he explained that essentially [**there is no real
coop**eration]{.underline} and that [the US cannot expect to work with
certain counterparts]{.underline}. I still regret the mental effort I
wasted with naive thoughts about true international counterterrorism
collaboration.

The timeline of the Crocus City Hall attack in Moscow on March 22 offers
a detailed case study of why the United States and its Western allies
should permanently shelve any counterterrorism cooperation with Russia,
right across the board from the intelligence and tactical level to
strategic efforts.

[The US **gains nothing from**]{.underline} sharing information with
**[Russia]{.underline}**, and [we shame our intelligence and law
enforcement officers if we expect any degree of mutual respect and
reciprocity from their Russian counterparts]{.underline}. We also
propagate a brutal and ineffective regime's security apparatus.

On 7 March, [the US Embassy to Russia publicly warned of possible
attacks on large crowds]{.underline}. The National Security Council
cited "duty to warn" policies as the justification. In private, the
warning contained an extraordinary level of detail. US officials told
the Russians that the 6,000-seat Crocus City Hall concert venue was a
possible target, according to the Washington Post. On 19 March, Vladimir
[Putin called the warnings]{.underline} "**[blackmail]{.underline}**,"
apparently suggesting (though his logic was elusive) that the US might
be planning the attack it had warned about.

Just three days later, Islamic State-Khorosan (IS-K) jihadists struck
the venue. Beginning at 19:55, the four Tajik men spent the next 18
minutes using AK-pattern rifles, handguns, knives, and improvised
incendiary weapons to kill 143 people and wound or poison around another
200 via smoke inhalation from the fire they had started.

A Mumbai-style attack (that is gunmen rampaging through heavily
populated urban spaces) requires a rapid and heavily armed response from
police. And yet despite the US warning 16 days earlier which
specifically mentioned Crocus City Hall as a possible target, neither
local nor federal security forces made an appearance, allowing the
terrorists to do their work uninterrupted. There was, as far as can be
discerned, no additional or significant security at Crocus City Hall.

It's known that at 21:03, some 68 minutes after the attack began and 50
minutes after the Islamist gunmen left, no one from the Special Rapid
Response Units (SOBR) or the paramilitary OMON had arrived at the site.
Concert-goers waiting for rescue burned to death or died as they inhaled
smoke, including 28 people found in a toilet.

Within the next 24 hours, the suspects were captured, and the next steps
played out in a predictable, brutal fashion. Telegram channels showed
the torture meted out: one suspect had an ear cut off and shoved into
his mouth. Another was subjected to electrical shocks to the genitals.

When they arrived in court, all the men showed signs of abuse and
torture. One appeared unconscious. Two confessed. Despite rapid and
credible claims of responsibility from IS-K, Putin blamed Kyiv three
days after the attack, claiming the suspects had fled toward Ukraine
(they were in fact detained closer to Belarus.) FSB Director Alexander
Bortnikov then implicated the United States and the United Kingdom in
the crime, suggesting their intelligence services worked with Ukraine to
employ the Islamists.

To summarize --- [the US used its intelligence capabilities to warn a
hostile state of a forthcoming terrorist attack, giving sufficient
detail for the Russians to prevent it and was]{.underline} then [smeared
for supposedly organizing the bloodshed. The Kremlin's behavior
is]{.underline} all the more [**reprehensible**, given CIA warnings of
impending attacks saved countless Russian lives in]{.underline} both
[2017 and 2019]{.underline}, after which Putin conveyed thanks to the
CIA.

Even before this latest example of help being thrown back in its face,
the US and Russia never had a sustainable framework for counterterrorism
cooperation. Arrangements at the intelligence, law enforcement, or
geostrategic level had already collapsed.

While the US has a more global approach to terror group designations,
Russia has always set definitions according merely to whether they
target Russia.

Any Russian help to the US was always limited to those parameters, from
initial support for the war in Afghanistan to aiding FBI investigations
only when it served the Kremlin's purposes, as with the Boston Marathon
bombers when it offered some help two years before the attacks and then
stopped.

Russian support for the Global War on Terror is itself a tale of falling
cooperation and rising suspicion. Immediately after the 9/11 attacks,
there was tangible Russian support in Central Asia, but that barely
lasted a decade.

While reports of outright Russian support for the Taliban during the US
occupation were only graded as a low-confidence assessment, most of
America's longest war saw practically no support from Russia or its
partners. The US had to end operations out of Uzbekistan under Russian
pressure in 2005 and later across the whole of Central Asia.

Practically speaking, US help did nothing to stop this most recent
attack in Moscow. The Kremlin did not just ignore information, it
scoffed at it.

This seems to fit a pattern where [the **U**nited **S**tates **plays by
the old rules**, while **Russia casually breaks them**]{.underline}. It
was reported on April 1 that [CIA officers and other US
officials]{.underline} around the world [were deliberately targeted by
Russia's notorious GRU intelligence unit 29155, which used acoustic
weaponry to severely damage the health of numerous US officials with
expertise on Russia]{.underline} (incidents collectively known as Havana
Syndrome.) These are extremely serious allegations not formally accepted
by the US authorities, but they would hardly be a surprise.

Finally, [after looking at the brazen, public display of judicial
torture inflicted on the suspects, it is]{.underline} nothing short of
[**insulting** to have the honest work of Western counterterrorism
professionals used to support Putin]{.underline}. Even the sordid
history of enhanced interrogation during the George W. Bush
Administration does not compare to the abuse displayed (and celebrated
by leading propagandists and state officials, including the prime
minister) after the Moscow attack. The US would never accept any
intelligence the Russians had extracted using such torment, and should
in no way aid the work of men who operate like this.

Intelligence agencies with internal mechanisms requiring a duty to warn,
such as CIA, now face this dilemma: if warnings do not work, are not
guaranteed to protect sources and methods (and more specific warnings
inherently reveal more material), and are then misused by hostile states
both operationally and for propaganda, what is their use?

[The US should]{.underline} instead [recognize]{.underline} that [it has
**no duty whatsoever** to protect profoundly nasty totalitarian regimes
that abuse our goodwill]{.underline}, and the excellent work of our
intelligence agencies. It [is dealing with a Russian government either
**so incompetent or so cynical** that **it is willing to sacrifice** the
lives of 143 **people**]{.underline}, and many, many thousands more [in
its aggression against neighboring countries]{.underline} like Ukraine.

[The authoritarian bargain]{.underline} in such regimes [is that
citizens trade their freedoms for security; American intelligence
**should not assist Putin's image when his thugs fail**]{.underline}.

[Terrorist groups will continue to target Russia, and the US
will]{.underline} likely [continue to gather intelligence]{.underline}
on those groups. [Next time]{.underline} --- [and there will be a next
time]{.underline} --- [everyone involved might do well to
remember]{.underline} General Hayden's words of wisdom; **[Russia
doesn't really do cooperation]{.underline}**.

#### Mutual distrust prevents it.

"Mythology is not a lie," wrote Joseph Campbell, the great scholar of
myth and archetype. "It is metaphorical." Myths and metaphors provide
the narratives that inspire patriotic devotion, motivate soldiers to
fight, and help explain the outside world. And the myths that nations
cherish about themselves often reinforce the complementary myths that
they adopt about others.

[Russia and the **U**nited **S**tates harbor]{.underline} especially
[**powerful myths** about each other]{.underline}. The myth that [Russia
believes]{.underline} about [the **U**nited **S**tates is]{.underline}
that it has vassals rather than allies---that it is [a **hegemonic
power** that hides ruthless ambition and self-interest
behind]{.underline} appeals to [**liberal principles** and **legal

roughshod]{.underline} over what citizens want. As long ago as 1855,
U.S. President Abraham Lincoln described Russia as a place "where
despotism can be taken pure and without the base alloy of hypocrisy."

After more than a century of tension and conflict, [the U.S.-Russian
relationship is]{.underline} now [**structured around** these **myths**.
Myths weigh down that relationship, **obscuring nuance** and clear
perception]{.underline}. And [they]{.underline} have shaped, and [will
continue to shape]{.underline}, each country's part in the war in
[Ukraine]{.underline}. The myth that many Russians hold of the United
States is continually [**driving the Kremlin toward** harmful
**belligerence**]{.underline}.

The myth that [Americans]{.underline} hold of Russia is also a trap,
leading policymakers to [**misread the Kremlin** and]{.underline} to
[miss opportunities to weaken the regime or to find
compromises]{.underline}. To minimize dangerous misinterpretations, U.S.
leaders need to work harder to rise above these myths and archetypes. A
better understanding of the United States' own myths---and of
Russia's---would give U.S. policymakers more flexibility, help to foster
strategic empathy, and anticipate future changes in the Russian body
politic.

#### The United States is [locked in]{.underline} to seeing Putin as [impossible]{.underline} to cooperate with.

https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/myths-warp-how-america-sees-russia-and-vice-versa

[American myths about Russia have similarly **deep historical
roots**]{.underline}. The U.S. image of Russia as an unadulterated
autocracy dates to the nineteenth century. It flourished during the
Soviet era and briefly retreated during Boris Yeltsin's nine-year
presidency. (Americans venerated Yeltsin as more democratic than he
actually was.) Putin has restored the familiar image of Russia. The U.S.
approach to the Cold War often had the fervor of a messianic struggle,
and [Putin]{.underline} once again [**inspire**s Americans' moral
indignation]{.underline}.

[The **U**nited **St**ates' myth]{.underline} of Russia---[that Russia
is an **evil** and **ambitious
tyranny**]{.underline}---[has]{.underline} some **[domestic political
uses]{.underline}**. To interest inward-looking Americans in the outside
world, [Washington needs]{.underline} to conjure [a]{.underline} single
omnipotent [villain. Americans want to believe that they are
**fight**ing an **individual**]{.underline} who can be killed [rather
than a whole country]{.underline} that must be subdued. In crisis after
crisis, comparisons to Hitler are used to shock democracy-loving yet
complacent Americans into action. Putin is simply the latest in a long
line of autocratic leaders---Saddam Hussein, Slobodan Milosevic, Muammar
al-Qaddafi, and Bashar al-Assad, to name a few---who are portrayed as
single-handedly obstructing democracy and progress.

[Putin's]{.underline} larger-than-life [persona]{.underline} has
[exacerbated the view]{.underline} that [autocratic Russia has **no
domestic politics** and]{.underline} that [whatever the ruler wants
happens]{.underline}. Brian Jenkins, the senior adviser to the president
at the RAND Corporation, summed up this view when he wrote, "At home,
Putin faces no elections, no party or state institutions that threaten
his rule, no domestic political opposition. He is Russia. And Russia is
his." If Putin is Russia, the only thing that needs to be understood
about Russia is Putin's psyche. Ukraine and its allies are fighting
Putin's war against Putin's Russia. It is no surprise, then, that the
U.S. intelligence community has reportedly made evaluating Putin's state
of mind its top analytical priority.

Studying leaders matters for understanding one's adversaries and
particularly for understanding Russia; the Russian president clearly
dominates his country. But Putin still faces dilemmas at home. He sits
uncomfortably atop a complicated system of competing factions and
interests. He needs to ensure that the warring cronies beneath him do
not kill one another or rise up against him. At the same time, he must
keep the public adequately enthusiastic about him. The biggest producer
and consumer of sociological research in Russia is, in fact, the Russian
government, which nervously follows minute alterations in public
opinion.

Washington's various wars against evil dictators should, by now, have
yielded some hard-won lessons. None of these leaders turned out to be
all-powerful. Nor were they responsible for every problem in their
polity, as the United States repeatedly discovered after expending
enormous effort to remove them from the scene. For every such leader,
including Putin, domestic politics set the parameters of their foreign
policy. They rarely fought wars without their people behind them. Like
democratic leaders, autocrats know how to bring their populations along
when they go to war.

[Public opinion and the bureaucracy are]{.underline} both somewhat
[opaque in the dictatorship that Russia has become]{.underline}. But
public opinion limits the way Putin wages war and the settlements the
Kremlin can accept. Like any belligerent, the Russian government wants
to be able to claim victory: if Russia demonstrably loses the Ukraine
war, public frustration and outrage may well topple the government.

[Committed to the myth of a Russia **without domestic
politics**]{.underline}, however, [the **U**nited **S**tates **struggles
to interpret Russia**. Its policymakers fail to see]{.underline} that
[many of the Kremlin's actions are **aimed at a domestic
constituency**]{.underline}. Take [Putin's sudden decision]{.underline}
in September 2022 [to annex territories in Ukraine]{.underline}, many of
which Russia did not even control. Just a few months earlier, Putin had
publicly mocked his intelligence chief for suggesting annexation.
Putin's turnabout [baffled U.S. analysts]{.underline}, who interpreted
it as part of a grand, if phantasmagoric, plan to subdue Ukraine. Was
Putin losing his mind? In reality, these [aspirational annexations may
have been a **rhetorical flourish for internal consumption**, an
opportunistic attempt to rally popular support behind a war veering out
of control]{.underline}.

#### You cannot pacify a dictator.

Casey **Michel 24**, Head of the Combating Kleptocracy Program at the
Human Rights Foundation, M.A. in Russia, Eurasia, and Eastern Europe
Studies from Columbia University, "Trump's Russia Policy Is
Appeasement," Wall Street Journal, 02-06-2024,
https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-russia-policy-appeasement-ukraine-war-second-term-63b8e34a

With Donald Trump now heavily favored to be the Republican nominee for
president, his policy ideas are in the limelight. But his proposed
solution for Russia's invasion of Ukraine---the greatest security threat
to Europe and the West in decades---has drawn little scrutiny or
pushback. It can be summarized in one word: [appeasement]{.underline}.

The word is a charged one, and I don't use it lightly. It [points
directly to **failed policies**]{.underline}, especially those of past
Democratic presidents, and implies that Mr. Trump's proposed solution to
the war in Ukraine is similarly doomed.

Last year he suggested [letting Russia]{.underline} "[take
over]{.underline}" parts of [Ukraine]{.underline}, and a few months ago
claimed he would "resolve the war within 24 hours." The only way to do
that is to give Vladimir Putin what he wants, including recognition of
Moscow's proclaimed annexations in eastern and southern Ukraine.

The [stalemate]{.underline} in Ukraine [is frustrating]{.underline}, as
is Washington's dithering over unlocking funds to buck up Ukrainian
forces. But Mr. Trump's proposals are far worse, for all the reasons the
West supposedly learned years ago.

[The perils of]{.underline} appeasement---of thinking that [**granting
concessions to an autocrat** on the offensive will sate
him]{.underline}---[are **legion**. It is]{.underline} also [a gross
misreading of lessons learned]{.underline}, particularly in the lead-up
to World War II, when Western leaders rolled over in the face of a
genocidal maniac attempting to conquer Europe.

Neville Chamberlain, the figure most closely associated with
appeasement, framed the Nazis' ambition to shatter Czechoslovakia as a
"quarrel in a faraway country, between people of whom we know nothing."
Limited to Adolf Hitler's designs on Sudetenland, Chamberlain's view
might have seemed reasonable. But his policy in Munich stoked Hitler's
ambitions further, leading to the near-destruction of European
civilization.

The reasons for Chamberlain's failures are simple. He misunderstood
Hitler's ultimate designs and convinced the German tyrant that he could
barrel through Western warnings without consequence. Over and again, the
West proved Hitler right, until it was too late to prevent a world war.
With such a policy in Ukraine, Mr. Trump risks the same.

Mr. Trump wouldn't be the first American president to push appeasement.
The Obama administration's Iran policy involved turning a blind eye to
Tehran's support for proxy militias around the Middle East, so long as
Iran gave up its nuclear program. That merely fueled the regime's
ambitions. So, too, did Barack Obama's shortsighted "Russian reset"
policy, as did the Biden administration's initial belief that it could
"park" Russia.

This kind of [appeasement has a bipartisan legacy]{.underline}. But [in
Ukraine we]{.underline} now [risk a **horrific** and **destabilizing
outcome**]{.underline}.

As Joseph Goebbels wrote after the Munich agreements, Hitler's
"determination to obliterate the Czechs is unbroken." So, too, is Mr.
Putin's determination to shatter Ukraine, especially if a policy of
appeasement is pursued.

The scale of Hitler's atrocities may make the comparison seem
overwrought, but history increasingly rhymes despite Moscow's lack of
death camps and spiraling invasions elsewhere. Hitler and
[Putin]{.underline} both [rose]{.underline} to power [on the backs of
conspiracy theories and notions of **restoring great-power
status**]{.underline} to their countries. Both [entrenched dictatorship
on]{.underline} a platform of [revanchist rhetoric and neoimperialist
ambitions. And]{.underline} both, as scholars like Timothy Snyder have
detailed, [viewed Ukrainians as **subalterns**]{.underline} and Ukraine
as the launchpad to European dominance.

[Thinking]{.underline} that [appeasement will satisfy]{.underline} Mr.
[Putin's ambitions is]{.underline} as **[foolhardy]{.underline}** as
Chamberlain's belief that such a policy could halt Hitler---not least
[because it elides]{.underline} Mr. [Putin's broader goals in
Europe]{.underline}. While Mr. Putin supposedly aims at "de-Nazifying"
Kyiv, [the Kremlin is pushing for **broader** and **more unsettling
goals**]{.underline}. As Russia scholar Fiona Hill wrote in early 2022,
"[Putin hopes he can **strike a new security deal** with NATO and Europe
to avoid an open-ended conflict, and then it will be **America's turn to
leave**]{.underline}, taking its troops and missiles with it." [Thinking
the war is solely about]{.underline} territory in eastern Ukra[ine is as
myopic as thinking that Hitler wanted reunification with Sudeten
Germans]{.underline} and nothing more.

Contra Chamberlain, the war in Ukraine is hardly a faraway quarrel.
[Those pushing appeasement appear to **know nothing** of]{.underline}
Mr. Putin or [the Kremlin's ultimate designs. The idea]{.underline} that
[appeasing him will bring peace]{.underline} in our time [should be
**dismissed out of hand**]{.underline}---and has no place in the White
House.

### AT: Cooperation Good\-\--Climate

#### Climate coop fails.

Samu **Paukkunen &** James **Black 24**, Deputy Director of the Finnish
Institute of International Affairs, former Advisor in the Ministry for
Foreign Affairs of Finland, Deputy Director of the Defence and Security
Research Group at RAND Europe, M.A. in International Security from
Sciences Po, "Arctic cooperation with Russia: at what price?",

07-15-2025, https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiae226, DG

Similarly, [having access to Arctic climate data is important, but **not
at any cost**]{.underline}.46 This data is extremely significant to the
wider world as the Arctic plays a special and outsized role in
combating---or accelerating---global climate change.47 This stems from
the essential contribution that Arctic ice, snow and permafrost make to
reflecting solar radiation (the 'albedo effect'), thus cooling overall
planetary temperatures.48 Conversely, when permafrost melts, it can
release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane into the
atmosphere, causing a feedback loop of more warming, more loss of
permafrost, and so on. (Receding permafrost also releases anthrax and
other frozen pathogens into the local environment.49) Similar runaway
climatological effects are associated with melting Arctic sea ice. This
not only causes coastal erosion but also releases fresh water into the
sea, disrupting the halocline and global ocean currents, in turn making
it harder for sea ice to reform---another vicious cycle.50

However, [Russia's emissions have not declined, nor has it been
forthcoming in providing]{.underline} the necessary [information
regarding climatological and environmental issues]{.underline}, even as
working group cooperation has nominally resumed.51 As such, [Russia
continues to accrue the political and propaganda benefits of working
within the Arctic Council, without delivering on that
body's]{.underline} stated [collective goals]{.underline}. Furthermore,
one could argue that [Russia's withholding of climate
data]{.underline}---which is so important for the climate modelling work
of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change---[should not be a
problem for the Arctic Council alone]{.underline}. Russia's actions on
this matter have global consequences; if the climate data is not shared,
it is the global South that stands to suffer the most from the resultant
disruption to scientists' ability to model---and thus mitigate---global
warming. Should it not then be the responsibility of the global
community to demand this data, rather than of the Western Arctic
countries who already share all their findings and research?

The situation also begs the question of wider information-sharing.
Russia continues to share weather data through the World Meteorological
Organization, mainly because it is dependent on that mechanism. (Aerial
operations against Ukraine would be less efficient and precise, for
example, without accurate weather information for the Russian forces.52)
[Climate **info**rmation]{.underline}, by contrast, [is of **much lesser
concern to Russia**]{.underline}. And the broader issue of tac[kling
climate change is far from a priority for the Russian state and
econom]{.underline}y. Even in the wake of western sanctions, the economy
remains heavily dependent on exporting oil, gas and
petrochemicals---including from major projects and terminals in the
Russian Arctic.53 [Russia]{.underline} thus [seems to be specifically
withholding climate **info**rmation to **use it as a bargaining
chip**]{.underline} against other Arctic countries, [even as its wider
policies undermine the global effort to combat climate
change]{.underline}.

### AT: Cooperation Good\-\--Arms Control

#### Arms control with Russia has [always]{.underline} failed.

Michaela **Dodge 24**, Research Scholar at the National Institute for
Public Policy, Ph.D. in Political Science from George Mason University,
"What Do Russia's Nuclear Threats Tell Us About Arms Control
Prospects?", National Institute for Public Policy Occasional Paper, Vol.
4, No. 1, January 2024, accessed 07-24-2025,
https://nipp.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Vol.-4-No.-1.pdf, DG

Despite a history of Russia's nuclear threats against the United States
and its allies, and a brutal onslaught against Ukraine, U.S. Secretary
of State Antony Blinken stated that the United States remains "ready to
talk about strategic arms limitations at any time with Russia
irrespective of anything else going on in the world or in our
relationship."96 Perhaps that is why [arms control continues to
**over-promise** and **under-deliver**]{.underline} in U.S. national
security; it should be self-evident that [Washington must
consider]{.underline} "**[anything else]{.underline}** going on in the
world or in our relationship" before going down a path toward an
agreement, if an agreement is to benefit U.S. national security.

For example, [Russia's aggression, nuclear buildup, doctrine, and
threats ought to be considered]{.underline}, in addition to Moscow's
dismal arms control compliance record. Amazingly, [Moscow's blatant
treaty violations and evidence of adversarial strategic culture appear
rarely]{.underline} to be [considered]{.underline} significant
[by]{.underline} U.S. [arms control proponents]{.underline}.97 They
ought to be. [Russia's malign intentions are **so far removed** from the
West's cooperative approach to arms control that pursuing it cannot but
result in a **significant disadvantage for the U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline}---[and continuing frustration with
Moscow's]{.underline} arms control [behavior]{.underline}.

[Moscow's compliance record is **abysmal**. The Soviet Union signed
agreements while preparing to violate them, as was the case
with]{.underline} the [nuclear testing]{.underline} moratorium. Most
recently, [Russia decided to]{.underline} "[suspend]{.underline}" [New
START's implementation]{.underline}, halting required on-site
inspections and making it impossible for the State Department to certify
that Russia is in compliance with the terms of the treaty.98 Yet,
despite the U.S. inability to certify Russia's compliance, two leading
New START negotiators argued that they "do not see that Russian
suspension constitutes an extraordinary event that jeopardizes US
supreme interests"99---as if nothing short of threatening "US supreme
interests" is meaningful for Washington's continued pursuit of arms
control with a treaty partner that appears to have no qualms violating
agreements.

[For Moscow, treaty violations, noncompliance, and]{.underline}
"[suspensions]{.underline}," [appear]{.underline} to be **[a matter of
course]{.underline}** in the conduct of its foreign and defense policy[.
As long as a treaty serves Russia's interest, Russia will observe its
terms. When it does not, Russia will **stop complying**]{.underline} and
will even violate it, but may not formally withdraw from it. Why would
it, when it can do what it wants while keeping the United States
restrained and fully exploiting the asymmetry between the two
approaches? When the United States finally withdraws after years of
efforts to bring Russia into compliance, Russia gains a valuable talking
point about the United States being the one destroying the arms control
regime.100

[Russia's history of]{.underline} Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
([INF]{.underline}) Treaty [violations is instructive. The **U**nited
**S**tates started raising concerns]{.underline} about Russia's
compliance [in 2013]{.underline}, to no avail.101 Exhausting other
options, the United States [found Russia in violation]{.underline} of
its obligations under the INF Treaty [in]{.underline} its
[2014]{.underline} Adherence to and Compliance with Arms Control,
Nonproliferation, and Disarmament Agreements and Commitments Report.102
The 2015 edition of the report stated that "the cruise missile developed
by the Russian Federation meets the INF Treaty definition of a ground-
launched cruise missile with a range capability of 500 km to 5,500 km,
and as such, all missiles of that type, and all launchers of the type
used to launch such a missile, are prohibited under the provisions of
the INF Treaty."103

[Russia remained in violation]{.underline} of its INF Treaty obligations
[according to the 2016, 2017, and 2018 editions of the
report]{.underline}.104 [It took]{.underline} the Obama Administration
[three years]{.underline} after raising the initial compliance concern
[to convene a]{.underline} Special Verification Commission
[meeting]{.underline} with Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, and [Ukraine to
discuss Russia's violation]{.underline} within the multilateral format
provided by the treaty.105 At the end of 2018, the United States
assessed "that Russia has fielded multiple battalions of SSC-8/9M729
missiles" in violation of the INF Treaty.106 The report noted that the
covert development of the missile may have started as early as the
mid-2000s.107 After extensive efforts to bring Russia back into
compliance failed, the United States withdrew from the treaty in
2019.108

Over the years, [Russia **continued to deny any wrongdoing**, playing
for time while the **U**nited **S**tates would not violate the
INF]{.underline} Treaty [with its own version]{.underline} of a
ground-launched intermediate-range system. In fact, because
intermediate-range systems were banned by the Treaty, the United States
was reluctant to spend resources on seriously examining whether it would
benefit from these systems, let alone starting any major research
effort, until years after it first recognized Russia's violations.

[The problem of restoring treaty compliance]{.underline} by parties
intent on cheating [is not new]{.underline}. More than 60 years ago,
Fred Iklé, who would later become Director of the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, pointed out in his seminal article on challenges
related to treaty compliance and enforcement, that "[**detecting
violations is not enough**. What counts are the]{.underline} political
and military [consequences of a violation]{.underline} once it has been
detected, since these alone will determine whether or not the violator
stands to gain in the end."109 [The **U**nited **S**tates was **unable
to impose enough** political and military **costs** following
Russia's]{.underline} INF Treaty vio[lations to change Moscow's
non-compliance]{.underline}, partly [because Washington was constrained
by the]{.underline} very [treaty]{.underline} Russia was violating,
[and]{.underline} partly [because Russia had too much to gain by
violating]{.underline} the treaty. In fact, there are very few examples
of the United States being successful in bringing a determined violator
back into compliance with an existing arms control agreement absent a
significant change in political conditions that improved bilateral
relations---e.g., when President Gorbachev confirmed Russia was in
violation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty after years of
Russia's denials. Such a change in Russia today seems unlikely, but it
would be imprudent to base U.S. arms control policy on the assumption of
such a transition.

The asymmetry between the U.S. and Russian approaches to arms control is
striking. [While the United States shies away from
activities]{.underline} that could [be even remotely perceived as
contrary to]{.underline} the object and purpose of [a treaty, Russia
often **ignores treaty obligations and plows ahead**]{.underline} with
programs that violate them, [incurring limited costs]{.underline} for
its actions. In doing so, [**Russia relies on disinfo**rmation and the
**intricacies of arms control** to claim]{.underline} that [**the
U**nited **S**tates **is to blame**]{.underline} for the demise of arms
control architectures. [When Washington]{.underline} eventually
[withdraws, Russia blames it, not years]{.underline} of [its
own]{.underline} noncompliance and [violations, for]{.underline} the
[demise]{.underline} of arms control. It is much easier for Russia to
say, "The United States killed a treaty," than for the United States to
explain Russia's violations and what the United States has done to try
to bring it back into compliance, and so the United States is
perpetually put on defensive---a position it does not handle adroitly.

For example, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov recently stated that
"It is a medical \[sic\] fact that they \[the United States\] have
destroyed the entire international legal system of deterrence and
strategic stability."110 He menacingly continued that, "It's a good
thing they do not want a nuclear war, no one wants it. And the system of
agreements, which has been destroyed by the United States, exists
specifically to reduce its risk and to make this risk negligible at
all."111 There are many risks to the international system, but they
originate with revisionist powers and their armaments, especially Russia
and China, rather than with the United States, which has built and
maintained a relatively stable international order at great cost in
blood and treasure for decades---and has been scrupulous in its treaty
compliance.

Yet, some U.S. negotiators would prefer to keep the political context
separate from arms control negotiations. For example, Rose Gottemoeller,
former Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security,
recently wrote that, "America does not link nuclear arms limits to other
issues: they are an existential necessity in their own right, and if
Putin cannot recognise that, then it is to his own country's detriment.
His nuclear forces lose an important means to predict US behaviour just
as America is embarking on a two-decade modernisation of its nuclear
triad."112 [The notion]{.underline} that "[nuclear arms
limits]{.underline}" [are]{.underline} "[an existential
necessity]{.underline} in their own right" [is **absurd**; their value
can be judged only in relation to the security environment]{.underline}
in which they exist. [Arms control should never be separated
from]{.underline} the political [context]{.underline} in which it is
pursued. [Under the current conditions, it may not be in the U.S.
interest to]{.underline} continue to [live under agreements that
originated]{.underline} many years ago [in a]{.underline} much [more
benign threat environment]{.underline}---particularly if the United
States is the only party adhering to their terms.

Far from failing to see "his own country's detriment,"
[Putin]{.underline} apparently [**sees benefits in** Russia's **arms
control violations** and **nuclear** weapons
**superiority**]{.underline}. "[Just talking about]{.underline} this
(the [potential use]{.underline} of nuclear weapons) [lowers the nuclear
threshold]{.underline}. We have more than NATO countries and they want
to reduce our numbers. Screw them," he said.113 Putin's point of view is
[grounded in the **long-term failure** of the **U**nited **S**tates to
impose sufficient costs on Russia]{.underline} following its arms
control violations to restore the integrity of the agreement.114 Putin
is undoubtedly familiar with effective Soviet-era arms control efforts
to restrain the United States in areas of U.S. technological advantage
and enable the Soviet Union to take advantage of its areas of
strength.115 These efforts were often successful, particularly as they
pertained to missile defense.

[Through the arms control process, the Soviets managed to impose
**restrict**ions on missile defense programs in which the **U**nited
**S**tates was a]{.underline} technological **[leader]{.underline}**.
These [restraints]{.underline} long [outlived]{.underline} even the end
of [the Cold War, **despite the Soviet Union's** own
**violations**]{.underline}. When the national security environment and
missile proliferation (to which the Russians contributed) necessitated a
U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty in 2002, the Russians gained a
useful propaganda narrative that the U.S. withdrawal fueled an arms
race, a narrative still repeated within the arms control community two
decades later.116 In reality, the United States and Russia went on to
sign the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty (SORT or Moscow Treaty)
fewer than six months after the U.S. announcement of the ABM Treaty
withdrawal---a Treaty that included unprecedented reductions in the
aggregate number of accountable strategic nuclear warheads (down to
1,700- 2,200).117

#### It\'s wishful thinking.

the war in Ukraine hinders US-Russian nuclear arms control," Bulletin of

**[Nuclear arms control on hold]{.underline}**. The Kremlin launched its
unjustified invasion of [Ukraine]{.underline} on February 24, 2022. The
war---or the latest phase of a conflict that began in 2014 when Russian
forces illegally seized Crimea---is now well into its 11th month. It
[has not gone as Moscow hoped]{.underline}, however. The Ukrainian
military stopped the Russian army short of Kyiv, pushed the Russians out
of northern Ukraine, and conducted successful counteroffensives against
Russian forces in the Kharkiv and Kherson regions.

The [bilateral strategic stability dialogue was **paused**]{.underline}
shortly after Russia's assault began. But senior US and Russian
officials kept stating their interest in strategic arms control, raising
hope that both sides understood the merit of maintaining constraints on
their nuclear competition, even at a nadir in the broader bilateral
relationship. In a message in June 2022, President Joe Biden wrote "we
must continue to engage Russia on issues of strategic stability" even
while holding Moscow accountable for its war. Russian President Vladimir
Putin's spokesperson responded a few days later, noting that the Kremlin
was "interested in \[such talks\]" and that the sides would need to come
back to the question "sooner or later."

[The war]{.underline} nevertheless has [affected Russia's approach to
nuclear arms control]{.underline}. Last summer, [Washington expressed
readiness to resume on-site inspections under]{.underline} the terms of
the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ([New START]{.underline}). They
had been suspended by mutual agreement in 2020 due to COVID concerns.
However, [Moscow delayed their resumption, claiming]{.underline} that
restarting the on-site [visits would not]{.underline} "[take into
account existing realities]{.underline}" [and would lead to unilateral
US advantages]{.underline}. Russian officials had protested that its
inspectors would be hampered by US visa and travel restrictions, issues
that US officials could have resolved.

In early November, Washington and Moscow agreed to a meeting of the
Bilateral Consultative Commission (BCC), New START's implementing body,
which would offer a venue to work out the details for resuming
inspections and to address other treaty-related questions. Having this
meeting mattered for the broader discussion of strategic stability
issues as well as for New START, since [US officials]{.underline} had
**[conditioned their readiness]{.underline}** to resume that discussion
**[on the treaty returning to its normal functioning]{.underline}**.

Unfortunately, [the **Russia**n government **pulled the
plug**]{.underline} on the BCC session, literally on the eve of its
scheduled November 29 start day. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei
Ryabkov, attributed the decision to "technical reasons," adding "this is
not a cancellation, but a postponement." Ryabkov continued, however,
that [US-Russian arms control was **not**]{.underline}
"**[immune]{.underline}**" **[from other world events]{.underline}**, an
implicit reference to the war in Ukraine. [Moscow's decision to postpone
the BCC]{.underline} meeting [appeared]{.underline} far more
**[political]{.underline}** than technical. A few days later, Russian
Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov confirmed Russia's motivation for
postponing the BCC meeting: "[It's impossible to discuss strategic
stability]{.underline} nowadays [while ignoring]{.underline} everything
that is happening in [Ukraine]{.underline}."

So, as we enter 2023, both the BCC and the broader strategic dialogue
sit on hold.

#### Everybody says no.

The arms control foundations of definitions and goals serve as a useful
lens through which to view the current impasse in U.S.-Russian
bilateral, U.S.-Chinese bilateral, and U.S.-Russian-Chinese tripolar
arms control. Of the three countries, [only the **U**nited **S**tates
has an articulated set of arms control positions. These positions are
hampered by **bureaucratic debates** about diplomacy with Russia given
Moscow's actions in Ukraine, as well as **political divides** on the
efficacy of arms control]{.underline} as a national security tool in
dealing with great power competition [with Russia and China.
They]{.underline} also [**lack specificity** in how these positions meet
armaments and security objectives]{.underline} in a environment
dominated by Russia's war in Ukraine and the emerging two-peer problem.
[Russia has **no concrete proposals**]{.underline} on next steps, [only
a long-standing set of **harsh** and **vague** preconditions and an
**increasingly hostile attitude** to any engagement with the **U**nited
**S**tates. Moscow's refusal to engage]{.underline} on further arms
control measures **[predates]{.underline}** the current hostilities in
**[Ukraine]{.underline}**, with Russia [rejecting]{.underline} over the
years [a wide variety of U.S. proposals]{.underline} on nuclear and
non-nuclear issues over the last decade. [China]{.underline} also
**[lacks concrete proposals]{.underline}** on next steps,
[**maintain**ing a mistrustful **skepticism of arms control** and
**reiterating outdated lines** on how the onus is on the **U**nited
**S**tates and Russia to disarm further before China should be
involved]{.underline}. All of [this forms a **significant impasse** as
the lack of a concrete U.S. proposal meets **Russian enmity** and
**Chinese skepticism**]{.underline}. The current impasse demonstrates
the need for managing expectations, discarding proposals that are
aspirational and outdated, and seeking the necessary and the possible in
line with U.S. armaments policy in the current and projected competitive
security environment.

#### No Russian arms control\-\--different priorities and Ukraine both block it.

[The **U**nited **S**tates and Russia are **unlikely to reach an
agreement**]{.underline} on a formal treaty retaining current limits or
[imposing]{.underline} further [reductions on their]{.underline}
deployed [nuclear forces]{.underline} before the New START agreement
expires in 2026. [Although the **U**nited **S**tates seems willing to
move forward]{.underline} with negotiations, [it is **unclear**
whether]{.underline} that these [discussions will resume before the
conflict in Ukraine ends]{.underline}. In June 2023, Jake Sullivan,
President Joseph R. Biden's national security advisor, said that "rather
than waiting to resolve all our bilateral differences, the United States
is ready to engage Russia now to manage nuclear risks and develop a
post-2026 arms control framework."2 [Russia]{.underline}, however, has
rejected this approach. Sergey Ryabkov, Russia's deputy foreign
minister, has [blamed]{.underline} Russia's [suspension of New
START]{.underline} participation [on]{.underline} "the totality of
circumstances related to [the **destructive** and **hostile actions of
the U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}." In response to Sullivan's
statement, he said that "there is simply no basis for a productive
discussion here, but we are ready to patiently state our approaches and
explain why the US course is destructive."3

[**Differences in** the US and Russian **priorities** for a
treaty]{.underline} to replace New START [would further complicate their
ability to complete a new treaty before New START expires. The
**U**nited **S**tates has suggested]{.underline} that the subsequent
[agreement]{.underline} "[sustain limits]{.underline} . . .
[on]{.underline} the [Russian systems covered under new
START]{.underline} . . . [limit]{.underline} the [new]{.underline} kinds
of [nuclear systems]{.underline} Russia is developing; [and]{.underline}
. . . [address all Russian nuclear weapons]{.underline}, including
theater-range weapons."4 [Russia]{.underline}, in contrast [wants
the]{.underline} arms control [process to]{.underline} "cover [the
**entire spectrum of** offensive and defensive, **nuclear and
non-nuclear weapons** with a strategic potential]{.underline}."
[This]{.underline} list [includes offensive nuclear and conventional
strategic weapons, ballistic missile defenses, space]{.underline}-based
capabilities that could strike targets on earth, [and the nuclear
weapons of the **U**nited **K**ingdom and France]{.underline}.5 It would
likely take more than the short time remaining before 2026 to resolve
differences and conclude a treaty.

### AT: Cooperation Good\-\--Russia-China Alliance

#### Reject Russian blackmail over the China-Russia alliance.

Samu **Paukkunen &** James **Black 24**, Deputy Director of the Finnish
Institute of International Affairs, former Advisor in the Ministry for
Foreign Affairs of Finland, Deputy Director of the Defence and Security
Research Group at RAND Europe, M.A. in International Security from
Sciences Po, "Arctic cooperation with Russia: at what price?",
International Affairs, Vol. 100, No. 6, November 2024, accessed
07-15-2025, https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiae226, DG

Even more peculiar is how the present situation in the Arctic looks when
compared with other regional platforms for cooperation. [All
**coop**eration with Russia has been cut off where it can
be]{.underline} cut off. Cooperation in the Baltic Sea, the Barents
region, or with NATO and the EU---all have been severed, and Russia has
either been excluded or voluntarily withdrawn.54 Russia still
participates in the UN and the Organization for Security and
Co-operation in Europe, representing Russian interests in global and
regional affairs, as it has the right to do, but in these forums it has
been subject to vocal critiques from the representatives of countries
supporting Ukraine.55 It thus appears that western countries have had
their reasons---not related to the Arctic Council's actual goals and
activities---to continue cooperation. Here, the desire to reassure
Russia and avoid a military standoff in the Arctic, to maintain the
primacy of the Council in regional governance and to avoid the spectre
of yet deeper Sino-Russian cooperation all appear major motivations.
Against this, [Russia has repeatedly made bellicose statements
about]{.underline} possible [use of]{.underline} military [force against
Arctic states, has threatened to completely end Arctic Council
**coop**eration and is increasingly signalling its intention to
intensify Arctic **coop**eration with China]{.underline}. Some western
countries are concerned that military tensions will only increase with
Russia in the region if cooperation within the Council is not continued.
Yet even these arguments can be questioned. It is, for instance, of note
that [Russia did not leave the Council when Western Arctic countries
paused cooperation in early 2022]{.underline}. And, even if Russia had
left, this would not fundamentally change the situation. The hard
security dynamics would remain. Information-sharing on climatological
and environ- mental dynamics from the Russian side would be even more
limited---but at best this is already partial, as has been discussed.

[The threat that Russia might embrace with open arms an expanded Chinese
presence]{.underline} in the Arctic [seems]{.underline} similarly
**[overblown]{.underline}**.56 While sharing what is officially defined
as a limitless partnership, in practice [Russia is aware of the
**increasing asymmetry of its dependence on China**]{.underline}. 57
While courting inward investment, [Russia has always been wary over how
China eyes the Arctic, conscious]{.underline} that [it is the only
region where Russia still has the relative advantage of conventional
military power]{.underline} as regards other actors. [Russia would not
serve itself well by letting China have too great a political role or
physical presence]{.underline} in the area. [If this were to happen,
Russia would lose even more of its already waning leverage over
China]{.underline}---a development difficult to undo in future. At the
same time, [the **U**nited **S**tates would be forced to invest more in
its own military capabilities, so that it could respond]{.underline} to
this new situation.58

### AT: Cooperation Good\-\--Mistrust Inevitable

#### The myths are [mutually reinforcing]{.underline}, blocking the effectiveness of the aff's olive branch AND dooming its credibility.

Russia---and Vice Versa," Foreign Affairs, 01-25-2024,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/myths-warp-how-america-sees-russia-and-vice-versa

The biggest problem posed by the [myths that Russia and the **U**nited
**S**tates have of each other]{.underline} is that they [are **mutually
reinforcing**. The more fanatical Moscow becomes about
contesting]{.underline} putative acts of [American **heg**emony, the
more Russia resembles the maniacal autocracy of American
myth]{.underline}. And the more Washington envisions Russia as the
abiding and wicked "other" in U.S. foreign policy, the more militarized
its relations to Europe are bound to become---and the more likely Moscow
is to construe the United States' aims as hegemonic. So far, the war in
[Ukraine]{.underline} has [epitomized this cycle of **progressively
hardening preconceptions**]{.underline}. With every passing month, each
country sees its myths draw closer to the objective truth.

Neither the United States nor Russia can easily dispel the myths that
the other holds. [Both countries nourish their myths for a reason. The
**Russia**n regime **wants the U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}---and
everyone else---**[to think]{.underline}** that it has no domestic
politics and that [**Putinism and Russia are one**. If the **U**nited
**S**tates frames]{.underline} the war in [Ukraine]{.underline}
principally [as a struggle for territorial integrity]{.underline} rather
than as a good-versus-evil battle against a lone tyrant, [Americans may
lose interest]{.underline}.

And [**even if leaders wanted to**, it would be hard to dislodge the
myths. The more actively Washington deployed public diplomacy to try to
change Russian perceptions]{.underline} of the United States, [the more
**Russians would perceive the** **U**nited **S**tates to be
**manipulating their country**]{.underline}. And to transform its image
within the United States, [the **Russia**n government would have to
divest itself of autocracy and pull back militarily]{.underline} from
Europe---[which has **never been a winning recipe**]{.underline} for
ruling Russia.

accessed: 7.24.25\]

Title: Is Biden\'s Lavish [**Courtship** of Illiberal **Modi
Immoral**]{.underline}?

[U.S. President Joe Biden delicately **navigated** a **backlash**
against Indian Prime Minister Narendra **Modi** during his state visit
to Washington]{.underline}, lavishing him with generous deals and
masterfully choreographed pomp and pageantry.

This meant overlooking his own State Department's scathing report on the
Indian leader's drift towards authoritarianism back home, and the
scalding rebuke of Modi's human rights record by fellow Democrats,
including his old boss, former U.S. President Barack Obama.

Biden needs a friend in Modi, hoping to cultivate him as a counterweight
to China. The U.S. sees India as a partner, particularly in defense and
technology.

Modi's four-day state visit at Biden's invitation was, as expected. as
high on optics as it was transactional, while traversing the high road
of political craftsmanship.

There was a state dinner for Modi, who also addressed a joint session of
Congress.

"I agree with President Biden that this is a defining partnership of
this century,\" Modi told America's lawmakers. \"The dark clouds of
coercion and confrontation are casting their shadow in the
Indo-Pacific."

He received a standing ovation when he declared, "The United States has
become one of our most important defense partners."

In a sign of the low tolerance level for illiberal democracy among
Democrats, [three **Congress members** boycotted **Modi's
address**]{.underline}, while 75 Democratic Senators and Congressional
representatives urged Biden to raise issues with Modi, including "the
[rise of **religious intolerance** in India as well as the targeting of
**civil society groups** and **journalists**, and growing restrictions
on **press freedoms** and **internet** access there]{.underline}".

Amid the flurry of high-level meetings and deals was a luncheon hosted
for him by both Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State
Antony Blinken, addressing a gathering of Indian Americans, and meetings
with leading figures, including Tesla and Twitter owner Elon Musk,
investor Ray Dalio, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, author Robert
Thurman, and economist Paul Romer.

Underscoring the asymmetrical relationship between "the largest economy
and the most populous democracy", the US offered advanced technologies
and co-development opportunities to India though it is not an ally,
which is normally a military ally and India has preferred to remain a
"strategic partner".

The two leaders announced India's \$3.1 billion purchase of 31 General
Atomics MQ-9B Reaper weaponized drones, to be assembled in India, as
also joint manufacture in India of the GE F414 fighter jet engines by
General Electric and Indian public sector defense major, Hindustan
Aeronautics.

New defense cooperation was also outlined, including logistics, repair
and maintenance infrastructure in India for American military aircraft
and ships.

Also agreed to were a plan for collaborative development and manufacture
of semiconductors, and a strategic framework combining NASA and Indian
Space Research Organization for human spaceflight cooperation by this
year end. And the U.S. even plans to send an Indian astronaut to the
International Space Center next year. Other key agreements focused on
boosting cooperation in artificial intelligence, telecommunications and
quantum technologies.

In contrast to the giddy crush of agreements and plans, there was no
public statement on any possible discussion on securing an unambiguous
commitment from Modi on major geopolitical issues like Russia's war on
Ukraine and China's rising belligerence.

Last year, Biden publicly called out India's response to Russia's
invasion of Ukraine "somewhat shaky". But New Delhi has its limitations
and treads a fine line between Russia and the US-led NATO alliance,
especially as it enjoys strategic partnerships with both Russia and the
U.S., both their largest vendors of arms.

Modi has yet to confront Chinese President Xi Jinping about the
thousands of Chinese troops still occupying several contested border
areas in the Himalayas after they overran India's border three years
ago.

India, in fact, has a business-as-usual approach to China, with
bilateral trade peaking to an all-time high of \$135.98 billion last
year.

In contrast, India's trade with the US was worth \$128.55 billion in
2022-23. Its trade with Russia too reached a new record high of \$44.4
billion in the past year, surpassing expectations.

The trip was also an opportunity for Modi and Biden to cozy up to each
other, after Modi's noticeably chummy ties with former President Donald
Trump.

Modi not only introduced Trump at the "Howdy Modi" rally in Houston in
2019 as "my friend, a friend of India", but had also openly cheered for
his 2020 re-election bid for the White House.

Modi lavished several gifts on the President and First Lady Jill Biden.
In particular, his extravagant gift to the First Lady of a lab-grown
7.5-Carat green diamond worth over \$12,000 -- an opulent offering
roundly disparaged back home.

The President reciprocated by gifting Modi a red T-shirt emblazoned with
the Prime Minister's quote, "The future is AI - America & India".

Biden's exuberant courtship of Modi revealed that even though he
champions democratic values, when it comes to India he's aware that for
strategic reasons he needs to do some coddling to hold the country
close.

Even as the two leaders were meeting, former U.S. President Barack Obama
told CNN: "By the way, if I had a conversation with Prime Minister
[Modi]{.underline}, who I know well, part of my argument would be that
if you [do not protect the rights of **ethnic minorities** in
India]{.underline}, then there is a strong possibility that India, at
some point, starts pulling apart."

It was Obama who revoked U.S. sanctions against Modi after he came to
office in in 2014.

Washington had previously blocked [Modi]{.underline}'s entry into the
U.S., when he [was a **regional leader** under the U.S. **Immigration**
and **Nationality** Act]{.underline} that "[makes any government
official who was responsible for or **directly carried out** at any time
particularly **severe violations** of **religious freedom** ineligible
for a visa"]{.underline}.

The then George W. Bush administration had determined that Modi had
failed to check the 2002 Hindu-Muslim riots in his home state.

Modi's distaste for democratic norms is evident in his aversion to face
the media as he shuns unscripted moments, and in the erosion of press
freedom under his watch. He relented when the White House convinced him
that a news conference was standard protocol for US state visits, but on
condition that it be a scaled-down event where both leaders would answer
just two questions each.

Participants were, however, startled to see a teleprompter installed at
Modi's podium that exhibited his pre-written answers. When asked by a
Wall Street Journal reporter about human rights violations in India,
Modi read out a denial that said there had been no such violations and
that India had "democracy in its DNA".

Back home in India, [Modi's **right-wing Hindu supporters** took to
social media to target **Sabrina Siddiqui**]{.underline}, the reporter
who asked the question and [who happens to be a Muslim, calling her an
"**Islamist**]{.underline}".

They, along with government ministers, also [attacked
**Obama**]{.underline} for his comments. [In a veiled **threat** against
**Muslims** in India]{.underline}, Himanta Biswa Sarma, an Indian
politician, tweeted: "[There are many Hussain Obamas in India itself. We
should prioritize taking care of them before considering going to
Washington]{.underline}."

University; Senior Editor at New Lines Magazine, "The Big Business of
Uyghur Genocide Denial," New Lines Magazine, 01-18-2022,
https://newlinesmag.com/reportage/the-big-business-of-uyghur-genocide-denial,
DG

A monthslong investigation by New Lines can reveal that over the past
five years [almost]{.underline} \$[65 million has filtered through
various entities connected with people who have **defended the Chinese
government** and **downplayed or denied documented h**uman **r**ights
**violations committed by Beijing against the Uyghur and Turkic Muslim
minorities**]{.underline}.

This funding has moved through a complex series of mostly tax-deductible
investment funds and charities, [all linked by]{.underline} virtue of
their governance structures to one man: the 67-year-old American tech
magnate [Neville Roy Singham]{.underline}.

Of mixed Sri Lankan and Jamaican heritage, Singham has long held an
ideological affinity with the Chinese Communist Party, dating to his
youthful membership in the League of Revolutionary Black Workers, a
Mao-influenced group based in Detroit, Michigan. In his capacity as a
cadre of the organization, which advocated revolutionary unionism in
opposition to racist policies within reformist unions, Singham took a
job at the Detroit Chrysler plant in 1972 at the age of 18.

After attending Howard University, Singham spent the next several years
cobbling together a consulting firm for equipment-leasing companies out
of a basement in Chicago. In 1993, he named his company Thoughtworks,
then expanded its focus to incorporate what Singham calls "Agile"
software development, which involves adaptive management, decentralized
systems, and close collaboration between developers and users.

In many ways Singham's radical evolution from an evangelist of the Black
industrial working class into a luminary of the information age embodies
the high-flown dreams of the transformative '90s.

According to a biographical note on the Chinese recruitment platform
Boss Zhipin, [Singham worked with]{.underline} Chinese tech monolith
[Huawei from 2001 to 2008 as a]{.underline} strategic technical
[consultant]{.underline}. During that period, [he raved about China's
economic model]{.underline}, telling Fortune magazine's senior editor
David Kirkpatrick in 2008, "China is teaching the West that the world is
better off with a dual system of both free-market adjustments and
long-term planning." Two years later, Thoughtworks' Fifth Agile Software
Development Conference was held in Beijing, with Singham proclaiming his
own influence on Huawei in his opening speech.

Thoughtworks has since expanded to 17 countries, taking on clients in
the business world while showing an interest in pro bono work for
progressive media such as the news organization Democracy Now! and the
Grameen Foundation, a well-regarded nonprofit focusing on microloans to
the world's poor.

In 2017, Singham sold Thoughtworks to Apax, a British private equity
fund, for an undisclosed price (although thought to be in the hundreds
of millions) and left the company altogether. Apax recently took
Thoughtworks public on the Nasdaq stock exchange, in September 2021,
with a valuation that nearly reached \$9 billion.

Singham did not respond to multiple attempts to reach him via email and
phone.

[Singham is in a relationship with Jodie Evans, one of the founders
of]{.underline} the women's group **[Code Pink]{.underline}**. New Lines
was unable to confirm whether they are officially married, but in
February 2019, Evans posted photos on Facebook of the couple celebrating
their anniversary and referred to Singham as her husband. Code Pink was
formed in 2002 as an activist group for progressive women united in
their opposition to the Bush administration's impending invasion of
Iraq.

In September 2020, [Evans]{.underline} was one of the speakers at an
online conference of far-left activists convened under the slogan of "No
Cold War." The speakers [contended]{.underline} that the United States
escalates conflict with [China]{.underline}, which, according to them,
[continues to wish for rational, peaceful relations with the
West]{.underline}. "Today the U.S. elite are obviously terrified at the
tremendous economic success of China," Evans insisted, arguing that
"China is not threatening the U.S. militarily." Also, she said, "China's
success stands in the way of U.S. domination of the world."

American history, says Evans, "begins with what is called original sin.
China, beginning in the 1400s, has not sought to be a maritime power.
Sections of the U.S. capital and the deep state," a term popularized by
the pro-Trump right to characterize the U.S. intelligence community,
"sadly have concluded that ... China \[is\] an existential threat."

[Pitting the]{.underline} virtually [**irredeemable U.S.** against the
innocent and besieged China has become]{.underline} something of [a
**narrative mainstay** among]{.underline} segments of [the
anti-imperialist left]{.underline} in North America. Ostensibly rooted
in ideological conviction, [this line of thinking is]{.underline} also
**[incredibly well financed]{.underline}**.

[One of the primary conduits for]{.underline} these [donations,
the]{.underline} People's Support Foundation ([PSF]{.underline}), [was
co-founded by Evans]{.underline}; documents describe her as its
president. With an avowed mission to empower people through education,
research and community, the PSF appears harmless, like any other
philanthropic organization seeking to do good in the world. Capitalized
to a tune of \$163.7 million, PSF, which is registered in the U.S. as a
501(c)(3) organization that grants its funders tax-deductible status for
their donations, invests heavily in corporate stocks and securities and
uses its revenue to disburse grants to other like-minded funds and
educational projects. [An **unmistakable bias** in favor of the Chinese
government runs throughout the activities of PSF]{.underline}, which has
no website.

The year 2017 appears to have been pivotal for those employed by, or
personally close to, Singham. Not long after he sold his company to
Apax, Thoughtworks employees began jumping ship only to turn up at PSF
--- and, conveniently, PSF's headquarters is only a five-minute walk
away from Thoughtworks.

PSF was established with the help of Chad Wathington, Thoughtworks'
chief strategy officer, who served as the foundation's treasurer and
director until late 2017, according to financial statements seen by New
Lines. Jason Pfetcher, the treasurer and director of PSF from 2017 to
2019, is Thoughtworks' former general counsel.

Neither Wathington nor Pfetcher responded to New Lines' repeated efforts
to contact them, and PSF's financial filings for 2020 are not yet
publicly available. (The extent of this investigation carries through
2019.)

Nevertheless, [overlapping personnel and a carousel of large
disbursements]{.underline} of funding [going to like-minded and
interlinked organizations remains a constant]{.underline} in all the tax
and financial data that New Lines analyzed, [as does the pro-China bias
of the recipients of **tens of millions** in largesse]{.underline}.

While PSF has no public profile, [Code Pink has generated its fair share
of controversy]{.underline} in the intervening period [for being less
focused on specific acts of U.S. foreign policy and **more sympathetic
to authoritarian governments**]{.underline} considered hostile to the
U.S.

In 2014, the Anti-Defamation League revealed that [Medea
Benjamin]{.underline}, one of Code Pink's founders, had [attended a
conference in Tehran that included German neo-Nazi Manuel Ochsenreiter
and Kevin Barrett, who]{.underline} has [claimed]{.underline} that "[al
Qaeda is Israeli]{.underline} and the state of Israel is a branch of al
Qaeda." When one fellow attendee, the journalist Gareth Porter,
expressed regret for participating in the conference,
[Benjamin]{.underline}, a former Green Party candidate for California's
governorship, doubled down and [insisted]{.underline} that [**she had no
qualms** with the conference]{.underline}.

In 2020, [Code Pink initiated a campaign]{.underline} titled "China Is
Not Our Enemy" [in which the organization advocates for the U.S. to
adopt a thoroughly conciliatory approach toward China]{.underline}. It
calls on supporters to lobby members of Congress and hosts podcasts and
webinars advancing the same argument.

Code Pink's website also includes an FAQ section on the Uyghurs. "Our
concern is that it is being used as a tool to drive the U.S.'s hybrid
war on China," it states, "instead of a human rights issue that needs to
be addressed as such." This page provides links to "helpful resources"
on the topic, one of which appears to treat the plight of the Uyghurs as
a human rights nonissue: A video featuring Evans and British academic
John Ross shows the latter [characterizing the Uyghur genocide
allegation as]{.underline} "**[farcical]{.underline}**" [and
a]{.underline} "**[total lie]{.underline}**."

Elsewhere, Ross, who was previously an economic and business adviser to
Ken Livingstone, the controversial former mayor of London, has written,
"If the real meaning of the term 'human rights' is used, it is evident
that China has the best human rights record in the world --- and those
words are carefully chosen. ... What is particularly striking is the
factual contrast between what China has achieved and the laughable claim
of the U.S. to a superior human rights record."

According to Brian Hioe, editor of the Taiwan-based, left-wing news and
commentary site New Bloom, this form of defense is part of an old
playbook that uses anti-imperialist tropes to "paper over genocide."

"[The Chinese government, as well as its defenders, sometimes try to
insist that Western powers are exaggerating or exoticizing what is
taking place]{.underline} within Chinese borders," Hioe told New Lines.
"What is ironic, however, is that [China's rhetoric justifying the
detention of Uyghurs was in many ways originally **drawn from the U.S.
War on Terror**]{.underline}."

"This is one means by which one can point to convergent behavior between
the U.S. and China in terms of police or surveillance states, though
certainly there are not vast detention camps on the scale of China in
the U.S.," Hioe continued. "[One can otherwise point to]{.underline},
for example, [China's use of Israeli technology for its surveillance of
Uyghurs]{.underline}. But [the strategy taken by the Chinese government
is to **relativize the issue**, while]{.underline} also [deflecting
blame back on the U.S. and other Western powers]{.underline}."

[Evans]{.underline} is a staunch advocate of the Palestinian cause and a
fierce opponent of Israel. She [and Benjamin support the]{.underline}
Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions ([BDS]{.underline})
[movement]{.underline} that seeks to bring about economic consequences
for Israel's mistreatment of the Palestinians living under military
occupation. **[Oddly]{.underline}**, though, [this doesn't seem to apply
to investments made by Evans' PSF organization]{.underline}. According
to the tax forms examined by New Lines, **[PSF has invested heavily in
Israeli companies that openly work with the]{.underline}** Israeli
Defense Forces (**[IDF]{.underline}**).

In 2017, for instance, [PSF held \$59,424 in corporate stock in the firm
Israel Chemicals Ltd.]{.underline} --- a holding whose worth fell to
just over \$48,000 the following year but grew to over \$72,000 in 2019.
On its website, [Israel Chemicals, Ltd. describes an ongoing
collaboration with the IDF in]{.underline} "[erecting a salt wall
opposite the border with Jordan]{.underline}." The nearly 10-foot-high
wall "will form a natural and innovative engineering obstacle,
contributing to Israel's security in an area that will suffer no major
environmental impact and will not be visible from the nearby hotels area
or road."

[PSF]{.underline} also [holds stocks in Caterpillar, the U.S.-based
construction vehicle company]{.underline} that is [**vociferously
opposed by pro-Palestinian activists** for aiding in the demolition of
Palestinian homes in the Occupied Territories]{.underline}. The BDS
movement's website hosts a number of articles condemning Caterpillar's
fleet of vehicles for participating in these acts. Yet according to its
2019 Form 990 filings, PSF had an investment worth about \$200,000 in
the company that year, down from its peak value of \$291,365 in 2017.

[PSF further invests in other major BDS targets including Hewlett
Packard]{.underline} (\$139,129 in 2019), which has provided technology
to aid in the biometric monitoring of Palestinians by the Israeli
military, according to multiple articles on the BDS Movement website.
[Another]{.underline} PSF investment [is in Atlas Copco]{.underline}
(\$114,222 in 2019), which sold materials "used in the construction of
the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem railway, which is partially built on occupied
Palestinian territory," according to the American Friends Service
Committee's website Investigate, which maintains a list of corporations
and banks targeted by BDS.

[These investments **are not flukes but appear to be the result of
conscious choices by PSF**]{.underline}.

[Out of 216 companies recommended for divestment]{.underline} by
Investigate, [PSF is invested in **51**]{.underline} of them, totaling
over \$13.5 million, approximately 8% of the foundation's initial
capital fund.

Neither Evans nor PSF responded to numerous attempts by New Lines to
comment.

The proceeds from PSF's investments are used to fund a variety of other
organizations, ostensibly for charitable purposes. But here, too, a
striking pattern emerges --- this one leading back to Singham and his
sprawling global portfolio.

[A large portion of the grants disbursed by PSF has gone to
the]{.underline} New York-headquartered [United Community
Fund]{.underline}, New Lines has found. PSF's 2019 tax filings itemized
some \$6.7 million in wire transfers to that fund and their 2018 filings
showed \$6.17 million. According to 2019 Form 990 filings, the United
Community Fund, a non-profit, tax exempt 501(c)(4) corporation, is
focused on "education and advocacy programs that promote human rights
and social justice." It is [run by Franziska Kleiner, the
former]{.underline} social and economic justice [lead of the German
subsidiary of Thoughtworks, the Singham-founded IT company]{.underline}.
Like PSF, the United Community Fund has no website.

In a strange labyrinth of money funneling, [some of the money that PSF
gave the United Community Fund was redistributed to other entities that
have ties to both organizations]{.underline}.

In 2019, for example, [the United Community Fund gave \$700,000 to an
organization called **Tricontinental**, whose deputy
director]{.underline}, Renata Porto Bugni, also [happens to be the
co-director and treasurer of the United Community Fund]{.underline}.

[Another of the fund's co-directors]{.underline}, until Aug. 31, 2019,
is Tings Chak, who [is]{.underline} also [head of Tricontinental's art
department]{.underline}. Prior to Chak leaving her directorial position
at the United Community Fund, there were four co-directors at the fund,
two held positions with Tricontinental and one was previously employed
at Thoughtworks.

Chak, meanwhile, is a board member and co-director at the Justice and
Education Fund through the end of the 2019 financial year. Her colleague
from Tricontinental, researcher Manolo De Los Santos, is also a
co-director at the Justice and Education Fund. The two organizations
share an organizational secretary, Nancy Taylor.

The New York-based Justice and Education Fund describes its mission as
raising "awareness through education and dissemination of information
about pressing problems of society to effect social change." Public
records obtained by New Lines show that in 2019, the Justice and
Education Fund gave \$8.33 million to the United Community Fund.

Established in 2017, Tricontinental presents itself as an "institute for
social research," hosting articles on global issues and bringing
together conferences like the one titled "No Cold War" in September 2020
where Evans spoke in defense of China.

[Tricontinental's founder, Vijay Prashad]{.underline}, is a former
professor of international studies at Trinity College in Hartford,
Connecticut, whose work focuses on the Non-Aligned Movement during the
Cold War and on the development of the BRICS countries: Brazil, Russia,
India, China and South Africa. He resigned from Trinity College in 2017,
and now [serves as a senior fellow at the Chongyang Institute for
Financial Studies, a think tank]{.underline} affiliated with Beijing's
Renmin University, which is [jointly financed by China's Ministry of
Education and the Beijing municipal government]{.underline}. One of
Prashad's colleagues at the institute is Ross, who is listed on the
website as a senior resident fellow.

Earlier this year, [the Chongyang Institute for Financial
Studies]{.underline}, along with two other think tanks based in China,
Taihe Institute and Intellisia Institute, [published a polemical and
awkwardly worded report titled]{.underline} "'America Ranked First'?!
The Truth about America's fight against COVID-19," which reads as if it
had been [translated from Chinese into English using a Google
algorithm]{.underline}. "Objective facts have shown," the report stated,
"that the U.S. is well deserved to be the world's No. 1 anti-pandemic
failure, the world's No. 1 political blaming country, the world's No. 1
pandemic spreader country, the world's No. 1 political division country,
the world's No. 1 currency abuse country, the world's No. 1 pandemic
period turmoil country, the world's No. 1 disinformation country, and
the world's No. 1 origin tracing terrorism country."

[Prashad's own corpus has]{.underline} lately [tended toward **defending
the Chinese government** with respect to one of its worst human rights
abuses: the mass internment, reeducation, forced labor and sterilization
campaigns waged in]{.underline} the northwest province [Xinjiang against
ethnic Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslim populations]{.underline}. The
Biden administration recently labeled this ongoing gross human rights
abuse a genocide and cited it as the reason the U.S. --- along with the
United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand --- is diplomatically
boycotting next month's Winter Olympics in Beijing.

In April 2021, [Prashad co-authored an article for]{.underline} an
organization called [Globetrotter]{.underline}, which was then published
in Asia Times and Peoples Dispatch. [It presented the diplomatic boycott
as part of an American **disinfo**rmation campaign to ratchet up
hostilities with China]{.underline}. "The U.S. government's information
warfare against China has produced the 'fact' that there is genocide in
Xinjiang," the article said. "Once this has been established, it helps
develop diplomatic and economic warfare."

[Such articles appear to be part of a **broader strategy to cultivate
media outlets where pro-China propaganda can filter
through**]{.underline}.

Globetrotter is an international syndication service that produces
articles focused on "the struggle for democracy and equitable societies
across the planet," according to its website, and Prashad is listed as
its "chief correspondent." Globetrotter has also partnered with the
Peoples Dispatch to bring in additional writers who report on "people's
movements" around the world. Chak and De Los Santos are among
Globetrotter's inaugural writing fellows for 2020-2021.

Formerly known as The Dawn News, [the Peoples Dispatch bills itself
as]{.underline} "[an international media project]{.underline} with the
mission of [bringing]{.underline} to you [voices from people's movements
and organizations across the globe]{.underline}." Like Globetrotter,
[contributors to the Peoples Dispatch include]{.underline} a familiar
cast of characters in [Singham's constellation of friends, colleagues
and family members including Kleiner and Singham's son Nathan, and again
Prashad, De Los Santos and Chak]{.underline}.

[The registered address of Peoples Dispatch is the same]{.underline} New
York [address given on tax forms for the Justice and Education
Fund]{.underline}.

Around the time that [Prashad]{.underline} denied the Uyghur genocide in
the article for Globetrotter, he also [appeared on a YouTube
channel]{.underline} called The Zero Hour with RJ Eskow, **[casting
doubt on the plight of the Uyghurs]{.underline}**, which human rights
monitors had by that time labeled a genocide. "What's the evidence?" he
asked rhetorically. "Well, there's none, really."

There is plenty, according to Amnesty International.

"[Amnesty has documented how Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly
Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang face **systematic state-organized
mass imprisonment, torture and persecution amounting to crimes against
humanity**]{.underline}," Amnesty International U.K. campaigns manager
Kristyan Benedict told New Lines.

[Media reporting has corroborated Amnesty's findings]{.underline}.

In November 2019, The New York Times published a major exposé based on
403 pages of leaked internal Chinese state documents, which, as the
paper noted, "provide an unprecedented inside view of the continuing
clampdown in Xinjiang, in which the authorities have corralled as many
as a million ethnic \[Uyghurs\], Kazakhs and others into internment
camps and prisons over the past three years." And in 2020, BuzzFeed News
won a Pulitzer Prize for its four-part investigation into the
infrastructure of this internment program in Xinjiang based on satellite
footage and interviews with former detainees.

That Prashad's denial of atrocities against the Uyghurs and other Turkic
Muslim minorities should coincide with mounting evidence that implicates
the Chinese government is particularly noteworthy because, until
recently, his organization was on record lending credence to the fact
that these abuses existed.

Early into its existence, in 2018, Prashad's Tricontinental highlighted
key "problems" with Beijing, which it characterized as "very grave,"
namely, "the detention of unknown numbers of China's Uyghur minority ---
and the arrests of Marxist students." By Prashad's current standards,
his own newsletter from this time would be guilty of "information
warfare" in tandem with the U.S. military-industrial complex.

So why the remarkable about-face?

The answer may lie in Prashad's closeness to Singham, whom, as recently
as Nov. 24, 2021, he described on Twitter as "\[o\]ne of my oldest
\[and\] dearest friends."

In 2017 [Prashad abandoned academia and inaugurated
Tricontinental]{.underline}, which is also [bankrolled]{.underline} in
part [by the United Community Fund]{.underline}.

In an email, Prashad told New Lines that he quit Trinity College in 2017
"because it was clear that neither the \[administration\] wanted me nor
did I really want to spend the rest of my life there. When the
opportunity afforded to do new things, for which I am grateful, I took
it."

Prashad declined to address New Lines' questions about the sources of
funding to Tricontinental, and he did not comment on Singham's alleged
financial involvement in his organization.

[The majority of Tricontinental's donor money remains unknown because
funds are disbursed as pass-through donations by]{.underline} a major
Wall Street investment bank. According to tax filings, Tricontinental
received \$12.45 million from [Goldman Sachs Philanthropy
Fund]{.underline}, a donor-advised charity that conceals its funders
from the public record, making it a convenient clearinghouse for moving
dark money to politically sensitive or controversial organizations.

Prashad's outspoken pro-China bent coincides with a nadir in U.S.-China
relations, precipitated by the growing evidence that bolsters Uyghur
genocide accusations and a host of geopolitical disputes like Chinese
industrial cyberespionage; the Chinese navy's brinkmanship in the South
China Sea; the Hong Kong police's violent suppression of pro-democracy
protesters in 2019; and Beijing's increased belligerent rhetoric toward
Taiwan, a U.S. ally.

[Tricontinental isn't the only organization in this network to benefit
from the Goldman Sachs Philanthropy Fund's anonymous contributors. The
Justice and Education Fund also received a generous
\$15,255,000]{.underline} --- [amounting to 99.5% of its total revenue
for 2019. Another group]{.underline}, which took in \$12 million from
the Philanthropy Fund in 2019, [is a cultural center in Manhattan called
The People's Forum]{.underline}. Featuring a coworking space, theater,
media laboratory and café on its premises at West 37th Street, The
People's Forum characterizes its mission as being an "incubator for
working class and marginalized communities to build unity across
historic lines of division at home and abroad."

[One event hosted]{.underline} on Sept. 18, 2021, [by The People's
Forum]{.underline} titled "China and the Left: A Socialist Forum," [was
co-sponsored by]{.underline} Evans' [Code Pink and jointly keynoted by
**Prashad** and the **Qiao Collective**,]{.underline} a self-described
Marxist group of "ethnic Chinese people living across multiple
countries" whose Twitter account routinely promotes the Chinese
government narrative on most any topic, including denying the Uyghur
genocide.

New Lines contacted the Goldman Sachs Philanthropy Fund to ask whether
it's aware that Tricontinental and The People's Forum promote and
amplify the narrative of Uyghur genocide denial, as well as what ethical
standards the fund has in place to assess grant recommendations from
donors to such organizations. The fund declined to comment.

Meanwhile, [De Los Santos is a co-director at The People's
Forum]{.underline}, and [the organization's operations manager, Rita
Henderson, also holds the position of director at
Tricontinental]{.underline}, according to the organization's 2019 Form
990 filings. Henderson's bio on The People's Forum states that she sits
on the board at Tricontinental. In yet another overlap in personnel,
[Evans serves as a co-director and secretary of The People's
Forum]{.underline}.

[The People's Forum took in more than \$3 million from the United
Community Fund]{.underline} in 2019, [which is not very surprising since
De Los Santos' Justice and Education Fund gave more than \$8 million to
the United Community Fund that same year]{.underline}.

[Prashad and De Los Santos]{.underline} have collaborated outside of New
York's socialist milieu. The duo [are travel companions]{.underline}.

In a photo taken in Venezuela and posted on Nov. 21, 2021, [De Los
Santos is shown alongside Prashad and]{.underline} Venezuelan President
[Nicolas Maduro giving the thumbs up on the day of regional and local
elections in which several Venezuelan opposition politicians had been
banned from participatin]{.underline}g. The European Union, which for
the first time in 15 years was invited to send election observers to
Venezuela, cited improvements in the country's voting system but could
not characterize the elections as free and fair. Prashad's tweet
embedding the image reads, "sovereignty against imperialism."

[Housed within The People's Forum New York office is yet another media
organization called **Breakthrough News**]{.underline}. Also pressing
Uyghur genocide denial, this project is [spearheaded by Rania Khalek,
**an apologist for** Syrian dictator **Bashar al-Assad**, whose previous
media ventures, Redfish and Soapbox, were]{.underline} both [exposed by
journalists as cutouts of **Russian state-funded media**]{.underline}.
Soapbox's parent group, [Maffick, sued Facebook for libel]{.underline}
in the U.S. District Court in California [after the social media company
labeled its subsidiaries]{.underline} "[Russia state-controlled
media]{.underline}." [But the case was dismissed, because the court
agreed]{.underline} that Facebook "tendered a substantial amount of
evidence in support of its view that **[Maffick is linked to the Russian
government]{.underline}**."

"It's completely unsurprising that [this network turned to]{.underline}
things like **[Delaware shell companies and U.S. accountancy
firms]{.underline}**, both of which don't require any checks on the
sources of income or what the funds might be used for," said Casey
Michel, author of "American Kleptocracy: How the U.S. Created the
World's Greatest Money Laundering Scheme in History." Casey added,
"Without increased oversight, expect far more networks like this to
emerge --- especially those networks that are spinning disinformation to
cover up some of the most heinous crimes on the planet."

Singham and others in his personal and professional network may be
sincere in their belief that no abuses are taking place in Xinjiang and
that human rights monitors and the U.S. government have exaggerated or
mischaracterized Chinese state policy in pursuit of national interests.
But Singham has his own bottom line to consider in fostering favorable
relations between the U.S. and China.

Huawei, the company he worked closely with for seven years, was
sanctioned by the U.S. by restricting American hardware manufacturers
from exporting certain technology, including those used in superfast
microchips, to the company, one of the world's largest smartphone
makers. Relatedly, Huawei, its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou,
and two of the company's U.S. subsidiaries were indicted by a federal
grand jury in New York in 2019 on 18 counts of conspiracy to violate the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, including
bank and wire fraud and conspiracy to defraud the U.S. through
industrial espionage. (After being detained in Vancouver in December
2018, Wanzhou was released; she returned to China following an agreement
she struck with the U.S. Department of Justice.)

The U.S. intelligence community considers Huawei a prominent national
security threat: In 2020, the Federal Communications Commission formally
designated the telecom giant as such, alleging it maintains close ties
to the Chinese Communist Party and Chinese military establishment.

Huawei has also been implicated in China's repression of the Uyghurs: It
tested facial recognition software in 2018 that, according to The
Washington Post, "could trigger a '\[Uyghur\] alarm' --- potentially
flagging them for police in China, where members of the group have been
detained en masse as part of a brutal government crackdown."

Since being slapped with U.S. sanctions, Huawei's returns have
diminished: In October 2021, The Wall Street Journal reported that its
"revenue fell 38% in the most recent quarter," the fourth straight
quarter of such American-induced losses.

[Singham's role]{.underline} as a strategic technical adviser with
Huawei may have ended more than a decade ago, but he [has continued to
bank on Chinese development. He is invested in two companies in the
country's consultancy and food industries]{.underline}: Shanghai
Luoweixing, with a registered capital contribution of \$20 million; and
Gondwana Foods, with one of \$32.5 million. Singham is also listed as
the legal representative of a third company, Shanghai Shinong Company
Ltd., registered in January 2020.

[His recent portfolio]{.underline}, too, [overlaps with pro-China
philanthropy]{.underline}.

In 2019, [the Justice and Education Fund contributed \$876,000 to a new
group]{.underline} registered in Madison, Wisconsin, [called People's
Welfare Association]{.underline}. According to 2020 Form 990 filings,
[one of the directors of that organization]{.underline}, until September
2019, [is Daniel Tirado Behrens, an employee at Shanghai
Luoweixing]{.underline}.

In five years a web of organizations and individuals that promote
apologetics for Beijing has emerged around Singham, and it all started
with his sale of Thoughtworks in 2017. Details of the sale were not
disclosed, but in a blog post Thoughtworks' chief scientist, Martin
Fowler, offered an explanation as to why Singham wanted to sell the
company he had run for nearly two decades: "With the money that selling
Thoughtworks would bring," it would enable Singham to "accelerate" his
activism. Yet, for an activist, Singham has remained elusive. He isn't
active on social media; and it seems he has made few public appearances
since 2018. For someone linked to tens of millions of dollars going to
pro-China causes, it would seem Singham prefers to keep a low profile.

Just as this investigation was winding down, the Twitter account for
[The People's Forum published a thread in which it confirmed receiving
money from Singham]{.underline}.

"A few years ago we met Roy Singham, a Marxist comrade who sold his
company & donated most of his wealth to non-profits that focus on
political education, culture & internationalism," the thread began. "It
seems to bother some folk that we receive funding that furthers our
anti-imperialist politics. It seems to bother them even more that our
funder is also a staunch anti-imperialist whose work goes back to the
Black Panthers & the \[League of Revolutionary Black Workers\] in
Detroit. Ultimately our solidarity with the peoples & countries at the
epicenter of the struggle against US Imperialism will not be moved by
the racist allegations made by people who loudly echo State Dept and
Pentagon discourse."

This thread, published on Dec. 21, followed New Lines' request for an
interview with the leadership of The People's Forum. As of publication
date, the request remained unanswered.

A key aspect of [China's new diplomacy is to]{.underline} "[struggle for
**global discourse power**]{.underline}" in order [to]{.underline}
"[break Western **heg**emony]{.underline}" [around global
norms]{.underline}.31 In the CCP's history books, China has suffered a
century of humiliation and "three afflictions" at the hands of Western
powers: "being beaten," "being starved," and "being scolded."32 The
first two were solved under Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping respectively.
Now, [in Xi Jinping's new era of]{.underline} "[national
rejuvenation]{.underline}," [China will **no longer accept being
scolded**]{.underline}. Instead, the time is ripe to "tell China's story
well" and defend "China's right to speak." Xi gave a taste of this new,
confident approach already in 2009 when, speaking to overseas Chinese in
Mexico, he said:

> China has managed to feed 1.3 billion people during a global financial
> crisis. There are some foreigners who have eaten their fill and have
> nothing better to do than pointing their fingers at our affairs. China
> does not, first, export revolution; second, export poverty and hunger;
> or third, cause unnecessary trouble for you. What else is there to
> say?33

[China no longer presents its]{.underline} political and economic
[model]{.underline} merely [as different from but as superior
to]{.underline} that of [liberal democracies]{.underline} in the West. A
White Paper issued last year stated that the CCP has "opened a new path
of human rights protection and added diversity to the concept of human
rights."34 According to Xi Jinping, "China's socialist democracy is the
most comprehensive, genuine and effective democracy."35 In 2021, Foreign
Minister Wang Yi said that "The standard of democracy and human rights
is whether the people of the country are satisfied and happy."36

[International human rights law recognizes]{.underline} that [it is
legitimate]{.underline} for states [to interpret human rights norms in
ways]{.underline} that are [compatible with the specific context in
which they are being applied. China's]{.underline} recent [rhetoric
**goes beyond**]{.underline} such [acceptable
interpretations]{.underline}, however, [and attempts to **redefine
fundamentally** how **h**uman **r**ights should be
understood]{.underline}. European and [US policymakers are]{.underline}
seemingly **[ill-prepared]{.underline}** to deal with this discourse.
"**[Whataboutism]{.underline}**," [the rhetorical practice of accusing
others of offences to deflect attention]{.underline} from one's own,
[and platitudes about cooperation **plague the China policy
debate**]{.underline}, and [they **undermine efforts** to defend
universal **h**uman **r**ights standards and **hold governments to
account**]{.underline}.37 [Even if well-intended and factually
correct]{.underline} (since systemic human rights abuses abound also in
the West), [whataboutism **does very little to advance h**uman
**r**ights **in China**]{.underline}.

## Cards About Shunning

### Isolating Russia Fails\-\--2AC

#### Russian behavior will [never change]{.underline} unless we cooperate\-\--isolating them only exacerbates the evils their evidence describes.

Valentina **Cassar 23**, Lecturer in International Relations at the
University of Malta, Ph.D. in International Relations from the
University of Aberdeen, "Anchoring US--Russia Relations: Perspectives,
Strategic Cultures, and Nuclear Posture," in *Russia's War on Ukraine:
The Implications for the Global Nuclear Order*, pp. 187-203, Springer,
2023, accessed 07-21-2025, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-32221-1_13,
DG

[The strategic cultures of the US and Russia have been underpinned
by]{.underline} the possession of nuclear capabilities, whereby the
following parameters serve as conditioning factors for both their
strategic cultures and nuclear postures: [a particular geopolitical
outlook; the maintenance of primacy; the defense of political values;
and maintaining an extended political reach]{.underline}. These can be
observed within their broader policy statements, strategy documents,
their nuclear postures, and across the varying "fluctuations" between
subcultures in policy and behavior. Moreover, their nuclear capabilities
and postures in turn sustain the broader strategic culture and views
maintained.

3.1 Geopolitical Outlook

[The outlook of the US is molded by its geographic expanse and
isolation, and the]{.underline} sense of [exceptionalism that
has]{.underline} in part [emerged from this]{.underline} (Gray, 1981).
As a result of the Cold War, the US became an active player in regions
far beyond its own (Klein, 1988). Following the end of the Cold War, the
US sought to adjust its global posture yet its geopolitical outlook
retained many of its Cold War strategic assumptions (Dueck, 2006). [It
considers itself a key player in other continents and appeared to
embrace its responsibilities for]{.underline} underwriting
[international security]{.underline} (Chollet & Goldgeier, 2008; Lewis,
2012). This outlook is facilitated and reinforced by its nuclear
capabilities, together with other political and economic resources
(Klein, 1988; Sperling, 2010).

[Russia has]{.underline} also [been **profoundly impacted** by its
historical experiences and geopolitical realities, with extensive
continuity from the Tsarist to the Soviet period, until the
present]{.underline} day (Tsygankov, 2022). [Russia's geopolitical
outlook has **remained consistent**, despite considerable geopolitical
changes]{.underline}. Subsequently, [a primary feature of
Russia's]{.underline} strategic [posture is the expectation that
geopolitical realities should conform to its geopolitical outlook,
rather than vice versa]{.underline}. This is a perspective that is
reaffirmed and facilitated by Russia's Nuclear Policy.

3.2 Primacy

[Both the US and Russia have historically viewed themselves as
exceptional]{.underline}. In his assessment of Cold War history, Gaddis
(1998) observed that the roots of US and Russian ambitions for grandeur
predate their post-Second World War rivalry. He cites Alexis de
Tocqueville (as cited in Gaddis, 1998, p. 1), who, in 1835, wrote:

> There are now two great nations in the world, which starting from
> different points, seem to be advancing toward the same goal: the
> Russians and the Anglo-Americans\... Each seems called by some secret
> design of Providence one day to hold in its hands the destinies of
> half the world.

Over the past decades, this sense of exceptionalism has been [bolstered
by]{.underline} their [nuclear capabilities]{.underline}.

US primacy rests on political, economic, and military primacy as well as
technological superiority (Troxell, 2012). These principles have long
been engrained within its outlook (United States National Security
Council, 1950). Its nuclear capabilities continue to play a central role
in securing its primacy (Kroenig, 2018). Moreover, the US is driven by
the need to maintain its advantages or relative parity. Over the past
decades, its nuclear posture remained concerned by Russia's nuclear
abilities, yet Russia was not the sole nuclear concern. Other issues and
actors, such as a rising China, rogue states pursuing nuclear ambitions,
or the role played by nonstate actors, also dominate the US posture.

[Inherent in Russia's strategic culture is its demand for primacy and a
messianic sense of self]{.underline}, which is [**deeply rooted** in
historical, cultural, and ideological tradition]{.underline} (Sinovets,
2016). [Russia inherited the Soviet Union's super-power
mindset]{.underline} (Miller, 2004), [together with the
perspective]{.underline} that [it is a great power and expects to be
treated as such]{.underline} (Kuchins & Zevelev, 2012).
[This]{.underline} outlook also [brings]{.underline} with it [an
**engrained expectation for victory**, yet is also accompanied by a
sense of vulnerability, perpetual threat, and encirclement]{.underline}
(Götz & Staun, 2022). Russia's nuclear credentials play a central role
in upholding its domestic primacy and afford it a sense of international
status and parity that may otherwise not be achieved (Blank, 2010;
Gottemoeller, 2004; Schneider, 2008).

3.3 Defense of Political Values

[The US and Russia have remained defensive of their
respective]{.underline} political [values]{.underline} and systems.
Central in US Strategy documents and narratives has been the defense of
US national identity, its way of life, liberties, and freedoms. Indeed,
what may be described as the blueprint of US strategic culture emerged
from the 1950 National Security Council Report NSC68, which prioritized
the US' defense of individual freedoms and liberties, in sharp contrast
to the authoritarian values of the Soviet Union (United States National
Security Council, 1950). The 1953 NSC162/2 also emphasized the
centrality of values, the protection of the American way of life, and
economic interests as vital to US security (United States National
Security Council, 1953). These themes have remained a recurring feature
within subsequent policy documents. It has also maintained a vision of
itself as the international defender and guarantor of liberalist
principles, despite criticisms that the US has not sufficiently done so
over the past decade (Ikenberry, 2018; Kagan, 2018). Moreover, democracy
promotion is presented as the foundation of US nuclear posturing (see
Bush, 1991; United States Department of Defense, 1993; The White House,
1995).

[Russia has]{.underline} also [remained sensitive regarding its
sovereign politics. Russia's state ideology is shaped by its geographic
expanse and historical experiences and **prioritizes the**]{.underline}
supposed [**collective interests of the state** above individual
interests and needs. The assurance of]{.underline} both [a strong
state]{.underline}, as a national objective, [and]{.underline} a strong
[leader, is required to ensure such goals. The characteristic of
Russia's state ideology is]{.underline} also [the perception that
**ensuring democratic credentials is not a priority** in the face of
ensuring Russia's international stature. Russia's political
system]{.underline} has [remained characterized by]{.underline} the
[strong and central leadership]{.underline}, together with an
acknowledgment that democracy has not yet been fully achieved (Sakwa,
2011).

3.4 Maintaining an Extended Political Reach

The US has maintained an extended geopolitical reach and prioritized
alliances, taking comfort within multilateral frameworks or "coalitions
of the willing." Nonetheless, the US has continued to assert---and
implement---the ability to go it alone when support is not forthcoming
(Sperling, 2010). Multilateral assurances and extended deterrence have
remained consistent aspects of US nuclear posture and strategic culture,
even during more inward-looking periods of international engagement.

Whilst **[Russia]{.underline}** has been more inclined to act
unilaterally, it **[recognizes the need to maintain external
relations]{.underline}** that enhance its power projection [and has
consistently sought to maintain a sphere of influence]{.underline} or
interest (Doris & Graham, 2022). Over the past two decades,
[Russia]{.underline} has [denounced the unilateral behavior of the US
and called for]{.underline} the establishment of [a multipolar
international order]{.underline} (Putin, 2007a). Russia has raised
particular objections regarding the expansion of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organisation (NATO) into countries that historically fell within
Russia's sphere of influence. And this is precisely what we have seen
escalate over the past years. [**Russia** **perceives itself to be
politically and militarily encircled**, and views its nuclear
strength]{.underline}, or the threat thereof, [as the best way to
guarantee its security]{.underline}.

### Isolating Russia Fails\-\--1AR

#### Shunning fails to isolate Russia\-\--there's no 'moral order' for shunning to uphold, just cold hard reality.

After the full-scale invasion against Ukraine, [Russia]{.underline}
quickly [became the global leader in]{.underline} terms of the [number
of sanctions imposed against the country]{.underline}. At that time, it
appeared that Moscow was on its way to complete economic and political
isolation. Firstly, sanctions -- especially financial sanctions and
exclusion from the international payment systems -- should have
massively increased the costs of engaging in any economic relations with
Russia.

Secondly, the [unprovoked aggression should have made Russia highly
untrustworthy]{.underline} in the eyes of most potential partners, even
those not directly affected by the war. Not only did Russia
single-handedly create a major international crisis (without any
discernable reasons for it), but it also did not bother to provide a
coherent narrative justifying the war (not only for the world, but also,
as a matter of fact, for its own citizens).

[Two years later, Russia]{.underline}, however, [remains]{.underline}
very **[far from]{.underline}** being completely [**isolated**. China
maintains intense economic and political relations]{.underline} with
Russia; [countries in the Global South, like India, the United Arab
Emirates and Brazil, as well as Russia's neighbors like Turkey, Armenia,
Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan, remain intermediaries]{.underline},
facilitating trade between Russia and the rest of the world.
[International organizations and clubs Russia is part of]{.underline} --
[like BRICS]{.underline} -- [continue to function and]{.underline} even
[attract new members]{.underline}. Although the EU and the US regularly
impose new restrictive measures, Russian companies and the state
successfully find new ways of evading them.

Economic isolation

From the standpoint of economics, sanctions are an example of
protectionism -- government measures aimed at constraining free trade
and investments across countries. Their motives, however, are different
than typical protectionist measures (which are introduced to boost
employment at home or strengthen domestic industry). Yet if one looks at
purely the economic side of the story, the effects are very similar,
while the same constraints are at play as with most other protectionist
policies, the most important one being the logic of arbitrage.

Arbitrage means that as long as there exist multiple isolated markets
with different price levels for various goods, there are profits to be
made from crossing the border and exploiting these price differences.
The more isolated the markets are, the larger the profits.

Examples confirming this logic are myriad. [India and China
import]{.underline} commodities [from Russia]{.underline} precisely
[because Western sanctions force Russia to sell]{.underline} these
[commodities at a discount]{.underline}; Turkey, the UAE and the
countries of the Eurasian Economic Union benefit a lot from the
rerouting of trade flows between EU and Russia through their territory.
For Chinese companies (e.g., automakers), the exit of Western firms from
Russia, along with Western sanctions, became an excellent (and
historically unique) tool to acquire new markets: Russia is now the
largest importer of Chinese cars in the world.

Certainly, the threat of new sanctions makes some companies from these
countries to rethink their engagement with Russia; however, others will
then come to take their place, attracted by even more lucrative economic
opportunities. This does not mean that this "shadow integration" of
Russia into the global world is in any way efficient or superior to how
the Russian economy worked before the war. [The costs of arbitrage are
substantial]{.underline} -- meaning that [imports to Russia are getting
more expensive]{.underline} (or are of lower quality) [and Russian
exports are sold at a lower price]{.underline}. However, the new model
works. Wealthy Russians still have access to luxury goods; Russian
factories continue to run; and, what is particularly worrisome, the
Russian military-industrial complex obtains the parts it needs to supply
the Russian army in Moscow's war against Ukraine.

Ultimately, this means that [the complete economic isolation of Russia
is **unlikely** as long as the Russian economy remains a sufficiently
attractive economic partner with a large domestic market and valuable
resources]{.underline}. The main reason why [sanctions against **No**rth
**Ko**rea]{.underline} (or even Iran) [worked much more]{.underline}
effectively than against Russia is that [North Korea]{.underline} or
Iran [had much less to offer]{.underline} to their [foreign economic
partners than Russia]{.underline} does.

There are limits to the effectiveness of even the most severe secondary
sanctions the West could impose against those willing to trade with
Russia. At the very least, these limits are determined by the monitoring
capacity not only of the West, but of national governments. In the worst
case, Russia's shadow integration into the world economy could trigger
the emergence of alternative payment systems and trade routes that are
entirely outside Western control -- this would be a substantial blow to
Western statecraft in the long run.

There is, however, an actor that can effectively put an end to the model
of "shadow integration" and that in fact remains the biggest threat to
the functioning of the Russian economy -- the Russian government itself.
In the past, Putin shied away from major interventions into the
functioning of markets and nationalization -- however, there is no
guarantee that this will continue moving forward.

In this case, the interest of non-Western countries in finding ways to
evade sanctions would quickly disappear, simply because Russia would
become less attractive economically. So far, however, this has not
happened.

When sanctions against Russia were introduced, one of their main goals
was not only to affect the Russian economy and politics, but also to
demonstrate to dictators worldwide that certain types of foreign policy
behavior would be very costly for them. [The failure to economically
isolate Russia]{.underline}, unfortunately, [seems to teach powerful
autocrats an entirely different, and]{.underline}, from point of view of
the EU and the US, [completely undesirable lesson: **one**]{.underline},
in fact, **[can weather even with the most severe Western
sanctions]{.underline}**. In the last two years, [the entire world has
learned the limits of Western economic power]{.underline} -- and [this
could have severe implications]{.underline} in the future.

Political isolation

From the point of view of the West, lack of trust makes it impossible to
engage in dialogue with Russia. In fact, so much trust has been lost
that most Western politicians and think tanks do not even have a clear
vision for reengaging with Russia, i.e. on what terms that would be
possible at all (and what Russia -- regardless of who is going to rule
it -- should do to regain trust). [Russia is seen as fundamentally
unpredictable. This appears to manifest]{.underline} itself, to name one
thing, [in the persistent speculation about potential direct Russian
aggression against NATO countries]{.underline}: from the Western
perspective, one simply cannot rule it out (ultimately, most analysts
ruled out the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and they turned out to be
wrong).

[The Global South]{.underline}, however, [does not]{.underline} seem to
[treat Russia with the same fear and doubt]{.underline}. The most
fundamental reason for that lies in their completely different
perception of the war. [For the West]{.underline} (especially for the
EU, whose attitude toward Russia saw a rather major transformation),
[the full-scale aggression against Ukraine was inconceivable, a unique
event since the end of World War II]{.underline} (it is not unusual to
refer to the war in Ukraine as the first war in Europe since 1945 --
ignoring the Yugoslav Wars and the wars in the Southern Caucasus).
**[For]{.underline}** most countries in **[the Global South, it was
not]{.underline}**.

[Wars]{.underline} -- from border skirmishes to full-scale invasions --
[are]{.underline} a [regular]{.underline} part of international politics
[in Asia, Latin America and Africa]{.underline}.

[The question is]{.underline} rather [what the interests and capacities
of Russia are with respect to particular world regions]{.underline}. And
from this point of view, the war in Ukraine, first, made Russia much
more interested in maintaining relations with the Global South, and
second, reduced Russia's capacities and limited its attention span (now,
Russia's entire foreign policy seems to be dominated by the Ukraine
war). Against this backdrop, working with Russia is considered quite
doable.

Moreover, some countries in the Global South embrace the strategy of
what one could call "political arbitrage" -- positioning themselves as
valued intermediaries between the West and Russia, or at least, as a
target for and a beneficiary of competition between the West and Russia,
with each side trying to bring these countries over to its side.

[For Russia's immediate neighbors, maneuvering between Moscow and the
West appears to be the **only feasible choice**: it is much less risky
and]{.underline} much [more beneficial than taking a side]{.underline}.
The leaders of these countries over time seem to be growing more and
more skilled in this maneuvering. A case in point is Kazakhstan: on
September 28, 2023, its president reassured the German chancellor that
his country was going to implement sanctions against Russia, while the
next day he stated that Kazakhstan was going to develop trade relations
with Russia. For more distant countries, meanwhile, the benefits of
political arbitrage could also be substantial, while the risks of
alienating Russia are, of course, much smaller.

Finally, [in the eyes of the Global South, Western
countries]{.underline} (especially the US) also [do not]{.underline}
necessarily [enjoy high credibility. They hardly have a track record of
never starting wars on questionable grounds and]{.underline} never
[exploiting their dominance]{.underline} for their benefit. [To name
just a few things that reduce the trustworthiness of the West: its
colonial past]{.underline}; CIA backing for [Operation
Condor]{.underline} in Latin America in 1975-83; the US invasion to
[Iraq]{.underline} in 2003; [and Germany's justification of bombing
Yugoslavia]{.underline} in 1999 because of the so-called Operation
Horseshoe plan of the Belgrade regime, which most likely never existing.
[This makes the global isolation of Russia **less likely** and the
arguments of Western diplomats and politicians **less
convincing**]{.underline}.

As in economic relations, [politically the key actor that can isolate
Russia and limit its attractiveness in the eyes of the Global South is
**Russia itself**]{.underline}. By exiting the grain deal (see
Russia.Post about it here), Russia damaged its reputation in the eyes of
African countries to an extent no effort of the West could have
achieved. Similar decisions in the future could turn out to be very
costly for Moscow.

Russia on the path to self-isolation?

Summing up, [both economic logic]{.underline} (the benefits of
arbitrage) [and political factors]{.underline} (Russia not being
perceived as a particularly untrustworthy partner) [make the isolation
of Russia **unlikely**. Pragmatism on the part of governments in the
Global South and their economic actors will help Russia to remain part
of the global web of political and economic relations. **Western efforts
to isolate Russia are unlikely to change that**]{.underline}.

What can, however, have a significant effect on Russia's position in the
world economy and politics is decisions of the Russian government
itself. By destabilizing its own economy or making costly errors in its
relations with countries in the Global South, Moscow could find itself
on a path to self-isolation. There is no certainty that will happen.
However, one lesson that can definitely be drawn from the war in Ukraine
is that [the ability of Putin's regime to make mistakes with serious
repercussions should not be underestimated]{.underline}.

Second, strategic opportunism. It cannot be denied that [norms and
values are]{.underline} also **[used strategically]{.underline}**. Thus,
[the motivation to invoke certain moral claims is **external to the
norms and values propagated**. Countries]{.underline} frequently [use
ideologically framed language to **achieve other strategic
goals**]{.underline}. Opportunistic behaviour should not be ruled out
for the Global South. Thus, we also aim at exploring to what extent
normative arguments are invoked instrumentally. For example, is the
overcoming of post- colonial structures and hierarchies in international
affairs an instrument for hegemonic aspirations or is decolonial
rhetoric firmly rooted in normative arguments informing foreign policy
position taking?

The nine country-focused contributions to this special section offer a
rich empirical analysis of how key actors of the Global South have
responded to the war. Based on the analytical categories provided above,
Table 1 offers an initial mapping of responses. Unsurprisingly a diverse
picture emerges. Across the board, [there is not a single explanation
which would be sufficient to explain position taking]{.underline} but
[various conditions are at play]{.underline} for different sets of
actors. However, [**consequentialist foreign policy behaviour appears**
as frequently **as strategic opportunism or a pragmatic**]{.underline}
position of **[indifference]{.underline}**. Only [the value-driven
approach occurs]{.underline} relatively **[infrequently]{.underline}**.
Thus, [rational actor behaviour seems to explain]{.underline} a fairly
large degree of [positioning]{.underline}.

What stands out is the frequent combination of [varied consequentialism
and strategic opportunism]{.underline}. They do often [appear
simultaneously]{.underline}. This implies that [countries try to offset
the negative consequences of the war through strategic gains in other
areas]{.underline}. In other words, [**strongly aligning** with Western
countries **against Russia, can not only be costly**]{.underline}, for
example through secondary effects of sanctions, **[it also runs against
geo-strategic goals]{.underline}** aiming to end Western hegemony in the
global system. However, [in detail, the costs and benefits]{.underline}
through sanctions, food and energy prices [vary significantly across
countries and are **not unidirectional**]{.underline} as the detailed
case studies will show. Interestingly, a pragmatic indifferent position
is primarily taken by countries which are often not affected by varied
consequences. In fact, for most countries of the Global South, the war
is peripheral, economically and politically, but with the potential for
major disruptions in their foreign policy. As a consequence of the war,
they do not see much value in strongly aligning with either side, the
West or Russia, and thus might rhetorically condemn the invasion but not
follow through with sanctions. The country cases provide for a
comprehensive comparative analysis.

[Virtue signaling is]{.underline} \"the act of [engaging in public moral
discourse]{.underline} in order [to enhance or preserve one\'s moral
reputation]{.underline}.\"16 The act is not objectionable as such. There
is nothing inherently wrong with insisting that a nation that invades
the territory of another, violating a core international law norm,
should be condemned. Rather, [what makes the act an example]{.underline}
of virtue signaling \"[is not the content]{.underline} of the moral
expression itself, [but]{.underline} rather the **[status
seeking]{.underline}** desires of the person or corporate entity making
it.\"17 [The negative valence of virtue signaling as **opportunistic
self-righteousness**]{.underline} has [prompted theorists to rebrand it
as]{.underline} \"**[moral grandstanding]{.underline}**.\"18

Translated to economic statecraft, the use of [sanctions in furtherance
of objectives such as reversing an invasion]{.underline} into a
neighboring country in violation of international law (Russia),
[preventing a violent regime from cracking down]{.underline} on civilian
population (Syria, Myanmar[), or dissuading a nation from pursuing a
nuclear]{.underline} weapons [program]{.underline} (Iran, North Korea)
[could]{.underline} all [be recast a]{.underline}s forms of [**virtue
signaling**. Sanctions are imposed not]{.underline} primarily [because
they are an effective way to realize these objectives, but because they
**communicate and reinforce a Western, liberal, and self-interested view
of the international order**]{.underline}, its rules, its proper power

However, "[sending a message]{.underline}," while ordinarily a
legitimate undertaking for a state, [becomes **ethically problematic**
if the means of communication consist of depriving vulnerable
sectors]{.underline} of a foreign population of [basic
necessities]{.underline}. While sanctions against aggression might be
justified on utilitarian grounds, sanctions as a means of [sending a
message **cannot claim**]{.underline} the same **[moral
legitimacy]{.underline}**. And while deontological ethics might not be
able to raise a particular objection to sanctions that prevent
aggression--- since in either case, some innocent population will
suffer---the same cannot be said of sanctions as expression.
[Where]{.underline} "[sending a message]{.underline}" [or]{.underline}
"signa[ling resolve]{.underline}" [or]{.underline} "[expressing
outrage]{.underline}" [is the purpose]{.underline} of sanctions, the
[sanctions]{.underline} patently [entail the **use** of **human beings
as simply a means to an end**; **human suffering becomes merely a device
of communication**]{.underline}. Thus [this purpose is **unacceptable on

## Cards Not About Shunning

### Hedonism\-\--1NC

#### Pain and pleasure are fundamental [sentiments]{.underline} that derive [moral obligations]{.underline}.

**Cohon '18** \[Rachel; Fall; Associate Professor of Philosophy at the
University at Albany; SEP, "Hume's Moral Philosophy,"
https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-moral/; Accessed 7.22.25\]

A related but more metaphysical controversy would be stated thus today:
what is the source or foundation of moral norms? [In Hume's day this is
the question what is the ground of moral **obligation**]{.underline} (as
distinct from what is the faculty for acquiring moral knowledge or
belief). Moral rationalists of the period such as Clarke (and in some
moods, Hobbes and Locke) argue that [moral standards or principles are
**requirements** of **reason**]{.underline} --- that is, [that the very
rationality of right actions is the ground of our **obligation** to
**perform them**]{.underline}. Divine voluntarists of the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries such as Samuel Pufendorf claim that moral
obligation or requirement, if not every sort of moral standard, is the
product of God's will. [The moral sense theorists]{.underline}
(Shaftesbury and Hutcheson) and [Butler see all requirements to pursue
**goodness** and **avoid evil** as **consequent** upon **human
nature**]{.underline}, [which is so structured that a particular feature
of our **consciousness**]{.underline} (whether moral sense or
conscience) [evaluates the **rest**]{.underline}. Hume sides with the
moral sense theorists on this question[: it is because we are the kinds
of creatures we are, with the dispositions we have for **pain** and
**pleasure**]{.underline}, the kinds of familial and friendly
interdependence that make up our life together, and our approvals and
disapprovals of these, [that we are **bound** by **moral requirements**
at all]{.underline}.

\<\<Text Condensed, None Omitted\>\>

Closely connected with the issue of the foundations of moral norms is
the question whether moral requirements are natural or conventional.
Hobbes and Mandeville see them as conventional, and Shaftesbury,
Hutcheson, Locke, and others see them as natural. Hume mocks
Mandeville's contention that the very concepts of vice and virtue are
foisted on us by scheming politicians trying to manage us more easily.
If there were nothing in our experience and no sentiments in our minds
to produce the concept of virtue, Hume says, no lavish praise of heroes
could generate it. So to a degree moral requirements have a natural
origin. Nonetheless,Hume thinks natural impulses of humanity and
dispositions to approve cannot entirely account for our virtue of
justice; a correct analysis of that virtue reveals that mankind, an
"inventive species," has cooperatively constructed rules of property and
promise. Thus he takes an intermediate position: some virtues are
natural, and some are the products of convention. Linked with these
meta-ethical controversies is the dilemma of understanding the ethical
life either as the "ancients" do, in terms of virtues and vices of
character, or as the "moderns" do, primarily in terms of principles of
duty or natural law. While even so law-oriented a thinker as Hobbes has
a good deal to say about virtue, the ethical writers of the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries predominantly favor a rule- or law-governed
understanding of morals, giving priority to laws of nature or principles
of duty. The chief exception here is the moral sense school, which
advocates an analysis of the moral life more like that of the Greek and
Hellenistic thinkers, in terms of settled traits of character ---
although they too find a place for principles in their ethics. Hume
explicitly favors an ethic of character along "ancient" lines. Yet he
insists on a role for rules of duty within the domain of what he calls
the artificial virtues. Hume's predecessors famously took opposing
positions on whether human nature was essentially selfish or benevolent,
some arguing that man was so dominated by self-interested motives that
for moral requirements to govern us at all they must serve our interests
in some way, and others arguing that uncorrupted human beings naturally
care about the weal and woe of others and here morality gets its hold.
Hume roundly criticizes Hobbes for his insistence on psychological
egoism or something close to it, and for his dismal, violent picture of
a state of nature. Yet Hume resists the view of Hutcheson that all moral
principles can be reduced to our benevolence, in part because he doubts
that benevolence can sufficiently overcome our perfectly normal
acquisitiveness. According to Hume's observation, we are both selfish
and humane. We possess greed, and also "limited generosity" ---
dispositions to kindness and liberality which are more powerfully
directed toward kin and friends and less aroused by strangers. While for
Hume the condition of humankind in the absence of organized society is
not a war of all against all, neither is it the law-governed and highly
cooperative domain imagined by Locke. It is a hypothetical condition in
which we would care for our friends and cooperate with them, but in
which self-interest and preference for friends over strangers would make
any wider cooperation impossible. Hume's empirically-based thesis that
we are fundamentally loving, parochial, and also selfish creatures
underlies his political philosophy. In the realm of politics, Hume again
takes up an intermediate position. He objects both to the doctrine that
a subject must passively obey his government no matter how tyrannical it
is and to the Lockean thesis that citizens have a natural right to
revolution whenever their rulers violate their contractual commitments
to the people. He famously criticizes the notion that all political
duties arise from an implicit contract that binds later generations who
were not party to the original explicit agreement. Hume maintains that
the duty to obey one's government has an independent origin that
parallels that of promissory obligation: both are invented to enable
people to live together successfully. On his view, human beings can
create a society without government, ordered by conventional rules of
ownership, transfer of property by consent, and promise-keeping. We
superimpose government on such a pre-civil society when it grows large
and prosperous; only then do we need to use political power to enforce
these rules of justice in order to preserve social cooperation. So the
duty of allegiance to government, far from depending on the duty to
fulfill promises, provides needed assurance that promises of all sorts
will be kept. The duty to submit to our rulers comes into being because
reliable submission is necessary to preserve order. Particular
governments are legitimate because of their usefulness in preserving
society, not because those who wield power were chosen by God or
received promises of obedience from the people. In a long-established
civil society, whatever ruler or type of government happens to be in
place and successfully maintaining order and justice is legitimate, and
is owed allegiance. However, there is some legitimate recourse for
victims of tyranny: the people may rightly overthrow any government that
is so oppressive as not to provide the benefits (peace and security from
injustice) for which governments are formed. In his political essays
Hume certainly advocates the sort of constitution that protects the
people's liberties, but he justifies it not based on individual natural
rights or contractual obligations but based on the greater long-range
good of society. 2. The Passions and the Will According to Hume's theory
of the mind, the passions (what we today would call emotions, feelings,
and desires) are impressions rather than ideas (original, vivid and
lively perceptions that are not copied from other perceptions). The
direct passions, which include desire, aversion, hope, fear, grief, and
joy, are those that "arise immediately from good or evil, from pain or
pleasure" that we experience or think about in prospect (T 2.1.1.4, T
2.3.9.2); however he also groups with them some instincts of unknown
origin, such as the bodily appetites and the desires that good come to
those we love and harm to those we hate, which do not proceed from pain
and pleasure but produce them (T 2.3.9.7). The indirect passions,
primarily pride, humility (shame), love and hatred, are generated in a
more complex way, but still one involving either the thought or
experience of pain or pleasure. Intentional actions are caused by the
direct passions (including the instincts). Of the indirect passions Hume
says that pride, humility, love and hatred do not directly cause action;
it is not clear whether he thinks this true of all the indirect
passions. Hume is traditionally regarded as a compatibilist about
freedom and determinism, because in his discussion in the Enquiry
concerning Human Understanding he argues that if we understand the
doctrines of liberty and necessity properly, all mankind consistently
believe both that human actions are the products of causal necessity and
that they are free. In the Treatise, however, he explicitly repudiates
the doctrine of liberty as "absurd\... in one sense, and unintelligible
in any other" (T 2.3.2.1). The two treatments, however, surprisingly
enough, are entirely consistent. Hume construes causal necessity to mean
the same as causal connection (or rather, intelligible causal
connection), as he himself analyzes this notion in his own theory of
causation: either the "constant union and conjunction of like objects,"
or that together with "the inference of the mind from the one to the
other" (ibid.). In both works he argues that just as we discover
necessity (in this sense) to hold between the movements of material
bodies, we discover just as much necessity to hold between human
motives, character traits, and circumstances of action, on the one hand,
and human behavior on the other. He says in the Treatise that the
liberty of indifference is the negation of necessity in this sense; this
is the notion of liberty that he there labels absurd, and identifies
with chance or randomness (which can be no real power in nature) both in
the Treatise and the first (epistemological) Enquiry. Human actions are
not free in this sense. However, Hume allows in the Treatise that they
are sometimes free in the sense of 'liberty' which is opposed to
violence or constraint. This is the sense on which Hume focuses in EcHU:
"a power of acting or not acting, according to the determinations of the
will;" which everyone has "who is not a prisoner and in chains" (EcHU
8.1.23, Hume's emphasis). It is this that is entirely compatible with
necessity in Hume's sense. So the positions in the two works are the
same, although the polemical emphasis is so different --- iconoclastic
toward the libertarian view in the Treatise, and conciliatory toward
"all mankind" in the first Enquiry. Hume argues, as well, that the
causal necessity of human actions is not only compatible with moral
responsibility but requisite to it. To hold an agent morally responsible
for a bad action, it is not enough that the action be morally
reprehensible; we must impute the badness of the fleeting act to the
enduring agent. Not all harmful or forbidden actions incur blame for the
agent; those done by accident, for example, do not. It is only when, and
because, the action's cause is some enduring passion or trait of
character in the agent that she is to blame for it. 3. The Influencing
Motives of the Will According to Hume, intentional actions are the
immediate product of passions, in particular the direct passions,
including the instincts. He does not appear to allow that any other sort
of mental state could, on its own, give rise to an intentional action
except by producing a passion, though he does not argue for this. The
motivating passions, in their turn, are produced in the mind by specific
causes, as we see early in the Treatise where he first explains the
distinction between impressions of sensation and impressions of
reflection: An impression first strikes upon the senses, and makes us
perceive heat or cold, thirst or hunger, pleasure or pain, of some kind
or other. Of this impression there is a copy taken by the mind, which
remains after the impression ceases; and this we call an idea. This idea
of pleasure or pain, when it returns upon the soul, produces the new
impressions of desire and aversion, hope and fear, which may properly be
called impressions of reflection, because derived from it. (T 1.1.2.2)
Thus ideas of pleasure or pain are the causes of these motivating
passions. Not just any ideas of pleasure or pain give rise to motivating
passions, however, but only ideas of those pleasures or pains we believe
exist or will exist (T 1.3.10.3). More generally, the motivating
passions of desire and aversion, hope and fear, joy and grief, and a few
others are impressions produced by the occurrence in the mind either of
a feeling of pleasure or pain, whether physical or psychological, or of
a believed idea of pleasure or pain to come (T 2.1.1.4, T 2.3.9.2).
These passions, together with the instincts (hunger, lust, and so on),
are all the motivating passions that Hume discusses. The will, Hume
claims, is an immediate effect of pain or pleasure (T 2.3.1.2) and
"exerts itself" when either pleasure or the absence of pain can be
attained by any action of the mind or body (T 2.3.9.7). The will,
however, is merely that impression we feel when we knowingly give rise
to an action (T 2.3.1.2); so while Hume is not explicit (and perhaps not
consistent) on this matter, he seems not to regard the will as itself a
(separate) cause of action. The causes of action he describes are those
he has already identified: the instincts and the other direct passions.
Hume famously sets himself in opposition to most moral philosophers,
ancient and modern, who talk of the combat of passion and reason, and
who urge human beings to regulate their actions by reason and to grant
it dominion over their contrary passions. He claims to prove that
"reason alone can never be a motive to any action of the will," and that
reason alone "can never oppose passion in the direction of the will" (T
413). His view is not, of course, that reason plays no role in the
generation of action; he grants that reason provides information, in
particular about means to our ends, which makes a difference to the
direction of the will. His thesis is that reason alone cannot move us to
action; the impulse to act itself must come from passion. The doctrine
that reason alone is merely the "slave of the passions," i.e., that
reason pursues knowledge of abstract and causal relations solely in
order to achieve passions' goals and provides no impulse of its own, is
defended in the Treatise, but not in the second Enquiry, although in the
latter he briefly asserts the doctrine without argument. Hume gives
three arguments in the Treatise for the motivational "inertia" of reason
alone. The first is a largely empirical argument based on the two
rational functions of the understanding. The understanding discovers the
abstract relations of ideas by demonstration (a process of comparing
ideas and finding congruencies and incongruencies); and it also
discovers the causal (and other probabilistic) relations of objects that
are revealed in experience. Demonstrative reasoning is never the cause
of any action by itself: it deals in ideas rather than realities, and we
only find it useful in action when we have some purpose in view and
intend to use its discoveries to inform our inferences about (and so
enable us to manipulate) causes and effects. Probable or
cause-and-effect reasoning does play a role in deciding what to do, but
we see that it only functions as an auxiliary, and not on its own. When
we anticipate pain or pleasure from some source, we feel aversion or
propensity to that object and "are carry'd to avoid or embrace what will
give us" the pain or pleasure (T 2.3.3.3). Our aversion or propensity
makes us seek the causes of the expected source of pain or pleasure, and
we use causal reasoning to discover what they are. Once we do, our
impulse naturally extends itself to those causes, and we act to avoid or
embrace them. Plainly the impulse to act does not arise from the
reasoning but is only directed by it. "'Tis from the prospect of pain or
pleasure that the aversion or propensity arises\..." (ibid.). Probable
reasoning is merely the discovering of causal connections, and knowledge
that A causes B never concerns us if we are indifferent to A and to B.
Thus, neither demonstrative nor probable reasoning alone causes action.
The second argument is a corollary of the first. It takes as a premise
the conclusion just reached, that reason alone cannot produce an impulse
to act. Given that, can reason prevent action or resist passion in
controlling the will? To stop a volition or retard the impulse of an
existing passion would require a contrary impulse. If reason alone could
give rise to such a contrary impulse, it would have an original
influence on the will (a capacity to cause intentional action, when
unopposed); which, according to the previous argument, it lacks.
Therefore reason alone cannot resist any impulse to act. Therefore, what
offers resistance to our passions cannot be reason of itself. Hume later
proposes that when we restrain imprudent or immoral impulses, the
contrary impulse comes also from passion, but often from a passion so
"calm" that we confuse it with reason. The third or Representation
argument is different in kind. Hume offers it initially only to show
that a passion cannot be opposed by or be contradictory to "truth and
reason"; later (T 3.1.1.9), he repeats and expands it to argue that
volitions and actions as well cannot be so. One might suppose he means
to give another argument to show that reason alone cannot provide a
force to resist passion. Yet the Representation Argument is not
empirical, and does not talk of forces or impulses. Passions (and
volitions and actions), Hume says, do not refer to other entities; they
are "original existence\[s\]," (T 2.3.3.5), "original facts and
realities" (T3.1.1.9), not mental representations of other things. Since
Hume here understands representation in terms of copying, he says a
passion has no "representative quality, which renders it a copy of any
other existence or modification" (T 2.3.3.5). Contradiction to truth and
reason, however, consists in "the disagreement of ideas, consider'd as
copies, with those objects, which they represent" (ibid.). Therefore, a
passion (or volition or action), not having this feature, cannot be
opposed by truth and reason. The argument allegedly proves two points:
first, that actions cannot be reasonable or unreasonable; second, that
"reason cannot immediately prevent or produce any action by
contradicting or approving of it" (T3.1.1.10). The point here is not
merely the earlier, empirical observation that the rational activity of
the understanding does not generate an impulse in the absence of an
expectation of pain or pleasure. The main point is that, because
passions, volitions, and actions have no content suitable for assessment
by reason, reason cannot assess prospective motives or actions as
rational or irrational; and therefore reason cannot, by so assessing
them, create or obstruct them. By contrast, reason can assess a
potential opinion as rational or irrational; and by endorsing the
opinion, reason will (that is, we will) adopt it, while by contradicting
the opinion, reason will destroy our credence in it. The Representation
Argument, then, makes a point a priori about the relevance of the
functions of the understanding to the generation of actions.
Interpreters disagree about exactly how to parse this argument, whether
it is sound, and its importance to Hume's project. Hume allows that,
speaking imprecisely, we often say a passion is unreasonable because it
arises in response to a mistaken judgment or opinion, either that
something (a source of pleasure or uneasiness) exists, or that it may be
obtained or avoided by a certain means. In just these two cases a
passion may be called unreasonable, but strictly speaking even here it
is not the passion but the judgment that is so. Once we correct the
mistaken judgment, "our passions yield to our reason without any
opposition," so there is still no combat of passion and reason (T
2.3.3.7). And there is no other instance of passion contrary to reason.
Hume famously declaims, "'Tis not contrary to reason to prefer the
destruction of the whole world to the scratching of my finger. 'Tis not
contrary to reason for me to chuse my total ruin, to prevent the least
uneasiness of an Indian or person wholly unknown to me. 'Tis as little
contrary to reason to prefer even my own acknowledg'd lesser good to my
greater, and have a more ardent affection for the former than for the
latter." (2.3.3.6) Interpreters disagree as to whether Hume is an
instrumentalist or a skeptic about practical reason. Either way, Hume
denies that reason can evaluate the ends people set themselves; only
passions can select ends, and reason cannot evaluate passions.
Instrumentalists understand the claim that reason is the slave of the
passions to allow that reason not only discovers the causally
efficacious means to our ends (a task of theoretical causal reasoning)
but also requires us to take them. If Hume regards the failure to take
the known means to one's end as contrary to reason, then on Hume's view
reason has a genuinely practical aspect: it can classify some actions as
unreasonable. Skeptical interpreters read Hume, instead, as denying that
reason imposes any requirements on action, even the requirement to take
the known, available means to one's end. They point to the list of
extreme actions that are not contrary to reason (such as preferring
one's own lesser good to one's greater), and to the Representation
Argument, which denies that any passions, volitions, or actions are of
such a nature as to be contrary to reason. Hume never says explicitly
that failing to take the known means to one's end is either contrary to
reason or not contrary to reason (it is not one of the extreme cases in
his list). The classificatory point in the Representation Argument
favors the reading of Hume as a skeptic about practical reason; but that
argument is absent from the moral Enquiry. 4. Ethical Anti-rationalism
Hume claims that moral distinctions are not derived from reason but
rather from sentiment. His rejection of ethical rationalism is at least
two-fold. Moral rationalists tend to say, first, that moral properties
are discovered by reason, and also that what is morally good is in
accord with reason (even that goodness consists in reasonableness) and
what is morally evil is unreasonable. Hume rejects both theses. Some of
his arguments are directed to one and some to the other thesis, and in
places it is unclear which he means to attack. In the Treatise he argues
against the epistemic thesis (that we discover good and evil by
reasoning) by showing that neither demonstrative nor probable/causal
reasoning has vice and virtue as its proper objects. Demonstrative
reasoning discovers relations of ideas, and vice and virtue are not
identical with any of the four philosophical relations (resemblance,
contrariety, degrees in quality, or proportions in quantity and number)
whose presence can be demonstrated. Nor could they be identical with any
other abstract relation; for such relations can also obtain between
items such as trees that are incapable of moral good or evil.
Furthermore, were moral vice and virtue discerned by demonstrative
reasoning, such reasoning would reveal their inherent power to produce
motives in all who discern them; but no causal connections can be
discovered a priori. Causal reasoning, by contrast, does infer matters
of fact pertaining to actions, in particular their causes and effects;
but the vice of an action (its wickedness) is not found in its causes or
effects, but is only apparent when we consult the sentiments of the
observer. Therefore moral good and evil are not discovered by reason
alone. Hume also attempts in the Treatise to establish the other
anti-rationalist thesis, that virtue is not the same as reasonableness
and vice is not contrary to reason. He gives two arguments for this. The
first, very short, argument he claims follows directly from the
Representation Argument, whose conclusion was that passions, volitions,
and actions can be neither reasonable nor unreasonable. Actions, he
observes, can be laudable or blamable. Since actions cannot be
reasonable or against reason, it follows that "\[l\]audable and
blameable are not the same with reasonable or unreasonable" (T 458). The
properties are not identical. The second and more famous argument makes
use of the conclusion defended earlier that reason alone cannot move us
to act. As we have seen, reason alone "can never immediately prevent or
produce any action by contradicting or approving of it" (T 458).
Morality --- this argument goes on --- influences our passions and
actions: we are often impelled to or deterred from action by our
opinions of obligation or injustice. Therefore morals cannot be derived
from reason alone. This argument is first introduced as showing it
impossible "from reason alone\... to distinguish betwixt moral good and
evil" (T 457) --- that is, it is billed as establishing the epistemic
thesis. But Hume also says that, like the little direct argument above,
it proves that "actions do not derive their merit from a conformity to
reason, nor their blame from a contrariety to it" (T458): it is not the
reasonableness of an action that makes it good, or its unreasonableness
that makes it evil. This argument about motives concludes that moral
judgments or evaluations are not the products of reason alone. From this
many draw the sweeping conclusion that for Hume moral evaluations are
not beliefs or opinions of any kind, but lack all cognitive content.
That is, they take the argument to show that Hume holds a
non-propositional view of moral evaluations --- and indeed, given his
sentimentalism, that he is an emotivist: one who holds that moral
judgments are meaningless ventings of emotion that can be neither true
nor false. Such a reading should be met with caution, however. For Hume,
to say that something is not a product of reason alone is not equivalent
to saying it is not a truth-evaluable judgment or belief. Hume does not
consider all our (propositional) beliefs and opinions to be products of
reason; some arise directly from sense perception, for example, and some
from sympathy. Also, perhaps there are (propositional) beliefs we
acquire via probable reasoning but not by such reasoning alone. One
possible example is the belief that some object is a cause of pleasure,
a belief that depends upon prior impressions as well as probable
reasoning. Another concern about the famous argument about motives is
how it could be sound. In order for it to yield its conclusion, it seems
that its premise that morality (or a moral judgment) influences the will
must be construed to say that moral evaluations alone move us to action,
without the help of some (further) passion. This is a controversial
claim and not one for which Hume offers any support. The premise that
reason alone cannot influence action is also difficult to interpret. It
would seem, given his prior arguments for this claim (e.g. that the mere
discovery of a causal relation does not produce an impulse to act), that
Hume means by it not only that the faculty of reason or the activity of
reasoning alone cannot move us, but also that the conclusions of such
activity alone (such as recognition of a relation of ideas or belief in
a causal connection) cannot produce a motive. Yet it is hard to see how
Hume, given his theory of causation, can argue that no mental item of a
certain type (such as a causal belief) can possibly cause motivating
passion or action. Such a claim could not be supported a priori. And in
Treatise 1.3.10, "Of the influence of belief," he seems to assert very
plainly that some causal beliefs do cause motivating passions,
specifically beliefs about pleasure and pain in prospect. It is possible
that Hume only means to say, in the premise that reason alone cannot
influence action, that reasoning processes cannot generate actions as
their logical conclusions; but that would introduce an equivocation,
since he surely does not mean to say, in the other premise, that moral
evaluations generate actions as their logical conclusions. The
transition from premises to conclusion also seems to rely on a principle
of transitivity (If A alone cannot produce X and B produces X, then A
alone cannot produce B), which is doubtful but receives no defense.
Commentators have proposed various interpretations to avoid these
difficulties. One approach is to construe 'reason' as the name of a
process or activity, the comparing of ideas (reasoning), and to construe
'morals' as Hume uses it in this argument to mean the activity of moral
discrimination (making a moral distinction). If we understand the terms
this way, the argument can be read not as showing that the faculty of
reason (or the beliefs it generates) cannot cause us to make moral
judgments, but rather as showing that the reasoning process (comparing
ideas) is distinct from the process of moral discrimination. This
interpretation does not rely on an assumption about the transitivity of
causation and is consistent with Hume's theory of causation. 5. Is and
ought

Paragraph Breaks Resume\>\>

[Hume famously closes the section of the Treatise that argues against
**moral rationalism** by observing that other systems of moral
philosophy]{.underline}, [proceeding in the ordinary way of reasoning,
at some point make an unremarked transition from premises whose parts
are linked only by "**is**" to conclusions whose parts are **linked** by
"**ought**"]{.underline} (expressing a new relation) --- a deduction
that seems to Hume "altogether inconceivable" (T3.1.1.27). Attention to
this transition would "subvert all the vulgar systems of morality, and
let us see, that the distinction of vice and virtue is not founded
merely on the relations of objects, nor is perceiv'd by reason" (ibid.).

Few passages in Hume's work have generated more interpretive
controversy.

According to the dominant twentieth-century interpretation, Hume says
here that no ought-judgment may be correctly inferred from a set of
premises expressed only in terms of 'is,' and the vulgar systems of
morality commit this logical fallacy. This is usually thought to mean
something much more general: that no ethical or indeed evaluative
conclusion whatsoever may be validly inferred from any set of purely
factual premises. A number of present-day philosophers, including R. M.
Hare, endorse this putative thesis of logic, calling it "Hume's Law."
(As Francis Snare observes, on this reading Hume must simply assume that
no purely factual propositions are themselves evaluative, as he does not
argue for this.) Some interpreters think Hume commits himself here to a
non-propositional or noncognitivist view of moral judgment --- the view
that moral judgments do not state facts and are not truth-evaluable. (If
Hume has already used the famous argument about the motivational
influence of morals to establish noncognitivism, then the is/ought
paragraph may merely draw out a trivial consequence of it. If moral
evaluations are merely expressions of feeling without propositional
content, then of course they cannot be inferred from any propositional
premises.) Some see the paragraph as denying ethical realism, excluding
values from the domain of facts.

Other interpreters --- the more cognitivist ones --- see the paragraph
about 'is' and 'ought' as doing none of the above. [Some read it as
simply providing further support for Hume's **extensive argument** that
moral properties are not discernible by **demonstrative
reason**]{.underline}, leaving open whether ethical evaluations may be
conclusions of cogent probable arguments. Others interpret it as making
a point about the original discovery of virtue and vice, which must
involve the use of sentiment. On this view, one cannot make the initial
discovery of moral properties by inference from nonmoral premises using
reason alone; rather, one requires some input from sentiment. It is not
simply by reasoning from the abstract and causal relations one has
discovered that one comes to have the ideas of virtue and vice; one must
respond to such information with feelings of approval and disapproval.
[Note that on this reading it is **compatible** with the **is/ought
paragraph** that once a person has the **moral concepts** as the result
of **prior experience** of the moral sentiments, he or she may reach
some particular **moral conclusions** by inference from **causal**,
**factual** **premises**]{.underline} (stated in terms of 'is') [about
the effects of character traits on the **sentiments** of
**observers**]{.underline}. [They point out that **Hume himself** makes
such inferences **frequently** in his **writings**]{.underline}.

6\. The Nature of Moral Judgment

On Hume's view, what is a moral evaluation? Four main interpretations
have significant textual support. First, as we have seen, the
nonpropositional view says that for Hume a [moral evaluation does not
express any proposition or state any fact; either it gives **vent** to a
**feeling**, or it is **itself a feeling**]{.underline} (Flew,
Blackburn, Snare, Bricke). (A more refined form of this interpretation
allows that moral evaluations have some propositional content, but
claims that for Hume their essential feature, as evaluations, is
non-propositional.) The subjective description view, by contrast, says
that for Hume [moral evaluations describe the **feelings** of the
**spectator**, or the feelings a spectator would have were she to
contemplate the **trait** or **action** from the **common point of
view**]{.underline}. Often grouped with the latter view is the third,
dispositional interpretation, which understands moral evaluations as
factual judgments to the effect that the evaluated trait or action is so
constituted as to cause feelings of approval or disapproval in a
(suitably characterized) spectator (Mackie, in one of his proposals). On
the dispositional view, in saying some trait is good we attribute to the
trait the dispositional property of being such as to elicit approval. A
fourth interpretation distinguishes two psychological states that might
be called a moral evaluation: an occurrent feeling of approval or
disapproval (which is not truth-apt), and a moral belief or judgment
that is propositional. Versions of this fourth interpretation differ in
what they take to be the content of that latter mental state. One
version says that the moral judgments, as distinct from the moral
feelings, are factual judgments about the moral sentiments (Capaldi). A
distinct version, the moral sensing view, treats the [moral beliefs as
ideas copied from the impressions of **approval** or **disapproval**
that represent a trait of character or an action as having whatever
quality it is that one **experiences** in feeling the **moral**
**sentiment**]{.underline} (Cohon). [This last view emphasizes Hume's
claim that **moral** **good** and **evil** are like **heat**, **cold**,
and **colors** as understood in "**modern philosophy**," which are
experienced directly by **sensation**, but about which we **form
beliefs**]{.underline}.

7\. Sympathy, and the Nature and Origin of the Moral Sentiments

[Our **moral evaluations** of persons and their character traits, on
Hume's positive view, arise from our **sentiments**]{.underline}. The
virtues and vices are those traits the disinterested contemplation of
which produces approval and disapproval, respectively, in whoever
contemplates the trait, whether the trait's possessor or another. [These
moral **sentiments** are emotions]{.underline} (in the present-day sense
of that term) [with a unique **phenomenological quality**]{.underline},
and also with a special set of causes. [They are caused by contemplating
the person or action to be evaluated without regard to **our
self-interest**]{.underline}, [and from a common or **general
perspective**]{.underline} that compensates for certain likely
distortions in the observer's sympathies, as explained in Section 8.
**[Approval]{.underline}** (approbation) [is a
**pleasure**,]{.underline} **[and disapproval]{.underline}**
(disapprobation) [a **pain** or **uneasiness**]{.underline}. The moral
sentiments are typically calm rather than violent, although they can be
intensified by our awareness of the moral responses of others. [They are
types of **pleasure** and **uneasiness** that are associated with the
**passions** of pride and humility, **love** and **hatred**: when we
feel **moral approval** of another we tend to **love** or **esteem**
her, and when we approve a trait of our own we are **proud** of
it]{.underline}. Some interpreters analyze the moral sentiments as
themselves forms of these four passions; others argue that Hume's moral
sentiments tend to cause the latter passions. We distinguish which
traits are virtuous and which are vicious by means of our feelings of
approval and disapproval toward the traits; our approval of actions is
derived from approval of the traits we suppose to have given rise to
them. We can determine, by observing the various sorts of traits toward
which we feel approval, that every such trait --- every virtue --- has
at least one of the following four characteristics: it is either
immediately agreeable to the person who has it or to others, or it is
useful (advantageous over the longer term) to its possessor or to
others. Vices prove to have the parallel features: they are either
immediately disagreeable or disadvantageous either to the person who has
them or to others. These are not definitions of 'virtue' and 'vice' but
empirical generalizations about the traits as first identified by their
effects on the moral sentiments.

#### Prefer [hedonism]{.underline}.

**Chappell and Meissner '23** \[Richard and D; 2023; Associate Professor
of Philosophy at the University of Miami, PhD from Princeton University
in 2012; Philosopher; Utilitarianism, "Theories of Wellbeing,"

[Hedonism is the view that well-being consists]{.underline} in, [and
**only in**, the balance of **positive minus** negative **conscious
experiences**]{.underline}. 5

On this view, [the only basic welfare goods are pleasant experiences
such as **enjoyment** and **contentment**]{.underline}. Conversely, [the
only basic **welfare bads** are **unpleasant** experiences such as
**pain** and **misery**]{.underline}. For the sake of readability, we
refer to pleasant experiences as happiness and to unpleasant experiences
as suffering.

[The hedonistic conception of happiness is **broad**]{.underline}: [It
covers not only paradigmatic instances of **sensory
pleasure**]{.underline}---[such as the experiences of eating delicious
**food** or **having sex**]{.underline}---[but also other positively
**valenced experiences**]{.underline}, [such as the experiences of
**solving** a **problem**]{.underline}, reading a novel, or helping a
friend. [Hedonists claim that all of these enjoyable experiences are
**intrinsically valuable**]{.underline}. [Other goods, such as wealth,
health, justice, fairness, and equality, are also valued by
**hedonists**]{.underline}, but they are valued instrumentally. That is,
they [are only valued to the extent that they **increase happiness** and
**reduce suffering**]{.underline}.

[When hedonism is combined with **impartiality**]{.underline}, [as in
classical **utilitarianism**]{.underline}, [hedonism's scope becomes
**universal**]{.underline}. This means that happiness and suffering are
treated as equally important regardless of when, where, or by whom they
are experienced. From this follows sentiocentrism, the view that we
should extend our moral concern to all sentient beings, including humans
and most non-human animals, since only they can experience happiness or
suffering. Alternatively, non-utilitarian views may accept hedonism but
reject impartiality, thus restricting hedonism's scope to claim that
only the happiness of a specified group---or even a single
individual6---should "count" morally.

[The notion at the heart of **hedonism**]{.underline}, that happiness is
good and suffering is bad, [is **widely accepted**]{.underline}. [The
simple act of investigating our own conscious experiences through
**introspection** appears to **support** this **view**]{.underline}:
[The goodness of happiness and the badness of suffering are
**self-evident** to those who experience them]{.underline}. 7

Importantly, [happiness seems **good**]{.underline} (and suffering bad)
[not simply because they **help**]{.underline} (or hinder) us [in our
pursuit of other **goods**]{.underline}, but [because experiencing them
is **good**]{.underline} (or bad) **[in itself]{.underline}**.

### Hedonism\-\--2NC

#### Pain and pleasure [outweigh]{.underline}. Everything else [regresses]{.underline}.

**Chappell and Meissner '23** \[Richard and D; 2023; Associate Professor
of Philosophy at the University of Miami, PhD from Princeton University
in 2012; Philosopher; Utilitarianism, "Arguments for Utilitarianism,"
https://www.utilitarianism.net/arguments-for-utilitarianism; Accessed

[Almost anyone would agree with utilitarianism that **suffering** is
**bad**, and **well-being** is **good**]{.underline}. What could be more
obvious? [If anything matters morally, human **well-being** surely
does]{.underline}. And it would be arbitrary to limit moral concern to
our own species, so we should instead conclude that well-being generally
is what matters. That is, we ought to want the lives of sentient beings
to go as well as possible (whether that ultimately comes down to
maximizing happiness, desire satisfaction, or other welfare goods).

[Could anything else be more **important**]{.underline}? [Such a
suggestion can seem **puzzling**]{.underline}. Consider: it is (usually)
wrong to steal. 3

[But that is plausibly because stealing tends to be **harmful**,
reducing people's **well-being.**]{.underline} 4

By contrast, most people are open to redistributive taxation, if it
allows governments to provide benefits that reliably raise the overall
level of well-being in society. So it's not that individuals just have a
natural right to not be interfered with no matter what. [When judging
institutional arrangements]{.underline} (such as property and tax law),
[we recognize that what matters is coming up with arrangements that tend
to secure **overall good results,** and that the most **important
factor** in what makes a result good is that it promotes
**well-being**]{.underline}. 5

[Such reasoning may justify viewing **utilitarianism** as the default
starting point for **moral theorizing**]{.underline}. 6

[If someone wants to claim that there is some other moral consideration
that can **override** **overall well-being**]{.underline} (trumping the
importance of saving lives, reducing suffering, and promoting
flourishing), [they face the challenge of explaining how that could
**possibly** be **so**]{.underline}. [Many common **moral
rules**]{.underline} (like those that prohibit theft, lying, or breaking
promises), while not explicitly utilitarian in content, [nonetheless
have a clear **utilitarian rationale**]{.underline}. If they did not
generally promote well-being---but instead actively harmed people---it's
hard to see what reason we would have to still want people to follow
them. To follow and enforce harmful moral rules (such as rules
prohibiting same-sex relationships) would seem like a kind of "rule
worship", and not truly ethical at all. 7

[Since the only moral rules that seem plausible are those that tend to
promote **well-being**, that's some reason to think that moral rules
are, as utilitarianism suggests, purely **instrumental** to **promoting
well-being**]{.underline}.

[Similar judgments apply to **hypothetical cases** in which you somehow
know for sure that a typically **reliable rule** is,]{.underline} in
this particular instance, **[counterproductive]{.underline}**. [In the
extreme case, we all recognize that you ought to **lie** or **break** a
**promise** if lives are on the line]{.underline}. In practice, of
course, [the best way to achieve **good results** over the **long run**
is to respect **commonsense moral rules**]{.underline} and virtues while
seeking opportunities to help others. (It's [important not to
**mistake** the hypothetical verdicts utilitarianism offers in
**stylized thought experiments** with the **practical guidance** it
offers **in real life**.) The key point is just that utilitarianism

#### Pleasure and pain have [intrinsic value.]{.underline}

[Pain and pleasure]{.underline} are among the **[strongest candidates
for]{.underline}** unconditional, **[intrinsic values,]{.underline}**
one phenomenon bad and another good in every instance. When pondering
the problem of evil, theologians regularly focus on pain, both physical
and emotional. [Pain is a felicitous example]{.underline}, since i
itself pain **[seems self-evidently, indisputably, objectively
bad]{.underline}**; some people see evil in the \"essential nature\" of
pain and suffering. We pity pain\'s victims, condemn its perpetrators,
complain about it, combat it any way we can; [\'pain\' is rooted in
\'poena\' -\'punishment\'.]{.underline} [Pleasure is fundamental to
living well.]{.underline} Pleasure, even slight, seems good, which is
one reason we love beauty, humor, music, and other innocent sources of
pleasure. Even J. L. Mackie and J. P. Sartre, who insist that [value
cannot be built into an object, assume that in itself, simply through
being what it is, pain is bad and pleasure good.]{.underline} Declaring
some pain is not bad and some pleasure not good, many [people consider
pleasure and pain conditional values.]{.underline} Many people say every
ethical principle meets exceptions, that there are no eternally valid
exceptionless moral principles. \"There is no moral principle, whatever
it might be, that will not be admitted to have some exception, even by
those sworn to uphold it,\" writes Richard Taylor (I984: 171).
Discovering exceptions to ethical generalizations may seem easy, a task
for undergraduates. Joseph Fletcher applauds moralists who reject
ethical universals and affirm the \'absolute particularity\' of every
situation (1966: z5). Melzack and Wall rate pain good, assigning it
\"real survival value\" when it precedes potential serious injury and
stimulates immediate with- drawal (i98z: 23-24). Lepers may sleep
peacefully while rats feed on their fingers: for lepers, not feeling
pain seems bad. Some people commend pain for sensitizing us to suffering
in others and building character.\' Were it not unpleasant in itself,
physical pain would not be bad in itself. People rate some pain
pleasant, not unpleasant, even in a respected dictionary pain is judged
only usually unpleasant. That a lobotomy, an incision into the frontal
lobes of the brain, removes all unpleasantness and intrinsic badness
from physical pain is philosophical orthodoxy today. Is pleasure always
good? Think of Austrian Schutztaffel volunteers, who, after
machine-gunning and mass-graving non-Aryan villagers in the \'40S go on,
in anonymity, to enjoy lives rich in pleasure and happiness; few would
commend their pleasure. Immanuel Kant (1785) and W. D. Ross (I 9 30: 1
36) rate only deserved pleasure and happiness good. People consider some
pleasure contemptible, not good - think of a deranged murderer pleased
as he chisels human skulls into lampshades. Deriving pleasure from an
act may make the act worse, Jonathan Dancy notes (1983: 534). \"The
pleasure proper to a worthy activity is good and that proper to an
unworthy activity bad,\" Aristotle remarks (X 75b 27). I believe
pleasure and pain are unconditional, intrinsic values: in all times and
places, cross-culturally and throughout the sentient realm, every
[pleasure is good and every pain bad in itself.]{.underline} In saying
this I use [\'pleasure\']{.underline} to [encompass every localized and
nonlocalized pleasant experi- ence,]{.underline} including the varied
[experiences we capture with \'enjoyment\', \'being pleased\'
and]{.underline} our numerous [other \'pleasure\'-idoms;
\'pain]{.underline}\' I use to [encompass every unpleasant
experience,]{.underline} including [emotional pain and the localized
sensations we call \'pains\'.]{.underline} Understood in this broad way,
\'pain\' is a direct counterpart to \'pleasure\', physical pain a
species of pain. Every physical pain, every sensation we correctly
designate a pain, is, 1 believe, unpleasant in itself and in this
respect bad. [That in itself every pleasure is good and every
pain,]{.underline} broadly conceived, [bad,]{.underline} that there are
unconditional values and so substantial exceptionless ethical
principles, should appear obvious. [**All moral**
**agents**]{.underline} - female and male - **[implicitly accept
this.]{.underline}** \"The philosophical problem here,\" writes Thomas
Nagel (1980: 109) in a similar context, \"is to get rid of the obsta-
cles to the admission of the obvious.\" I defend my assessment of
pleasure and pain primarily by refuting counterevaluations and alleged
counterex- amples; I rebut attempts to show there need not be good in
pleasantness, bad in unpleasantness, or unpleasantness in physical pain.
While specify- ing ways in which pleasure need not be good, I attempt to
pinpoint the respect in which all pleasure is good. When needed, I
identify misunder- standings of the unpleasant and pleasant linked to
incorrect assessments. The argument is applicable directly to happiness
and unhappiness, which parallel pleasure and pain ethically, and
indirectly to other ends. Various ethical convictions cannot fully
accommodate our being able to know pleasure and pain are unconditional,
intrinsic values: among them are strict particularism (ethical decisions
can only be made case by case; there are no sound universal normative
principles), relativism (all good and bad are relative to time and
place), skepticism (what is good or bad is undeterminable; any value
judgment can be successfully opposed and overturned), and nihilism
(nothing has value). What supports my the- sis overturns these views

#### People like pleasure and dislike pain.

II\. The Mill Fallacy

That [pleasure]{.underline} is [good and that it is desired
are]{.underline} obviously **[interrelated]{.underline}**. But which is
the more fundamental fact? (1) Is our desire for pleasure a consequence
of pleasure\'s being good? Is [pleasure\'s being good our reason for
wanting it]{.underline}? (2) Or, is pleasure\'s being good a consequence
of our desiring it? That the former position is the correct one may be
shown by proving the latter to be the incorrect one. There is no
sensible third alternative. On any third position pleasure\'s being good
would be neither our reason for wanting it nor a consequence of our
desire. From this it would follow that we want pleasure for no reason,
or for the wrong reason, and that it is merely through lucky coincidence
that what we want is actually good or worth wanting. This proposition
would be absurd. How are we to understand a suggestion that pleasure\'s
being good is a consequence of our desiring it and that pain\'s being
bad is due to pain\'s being unwanted? One interpretation is that an
object\'s being good is simply entailed by its being desired, or that
the word \'good\' when applied to pleasure simply means \'desired\'. To
see the fault in this position [we need]{.underline} only [recall a
lesson gained from studying Mill\'s Utilitarianism]{.underline}. While
attempting to establish happiness, or pleasure, as the sole standard for
what is good Mill referred to the fact that people desire happiness as
proof that happiness is desirable. G. E. Moore pounced on Mill for this,
calling it a fallacy, so obvious, \'that it is quite wonderful how Mill
failed to see it\' (Principia Ethica, p. 67). \'Desirable\' and \'good\'
do not mean simply \'desired\' but \'worthy or deserving of being
desired\'. An object can be desired without being worth desiring, or it
could be worth desiring without being desired in fact. That people
desire to lynch rapists, or enslave their neighbours, does not entail
that it is desirable or good that they do so. Recently, some
philosophers have come to Mill\'s defence, arguing that we do have some
sort of proof of desirability in actual desire, though some- thing short
of strict deductive proof. It would seem that they are committed to
finding some sort of inductive proof. The distinction between
something\'s being desired and its being worthy of desire can hardly be
denied. In what way, then, might desire be inductive evidence of what is
worth desiring or desirable? Defenders of Mill have not been clear. The
only sense I can give is as follows: [actual desire is evidence of
desirability in the way that actual belief may be evidence of what is
true]{.underline}. That [people in a village believe]{.underline} that
their [postman\'s name is Jack is some evidence that his name
is]{.underline} indeed [Jack]{.underline}. That [his name is Jack is not
contingent upon their having this belief; rather,]{.underline} their
belief, if it is correct, [is a con- tingent consequence of his name\'s
being Jack.]{.underline} Because people are rational they are disposed
to believe what they have reason to believe. Given this, there is more
than a random chance that there is some truth in what people in fact
believe. Similarly, because people are rational they tend to desire
objects when they have reason for doing so. In consequence, there is
more than a random chance that there is good in objects in fact desired.
However, [people can be mistaken in wanting something as they can be
mistaken in believing some- thing.]{.underline} [They may
desire]{.underline} some [food thinking that it is good
when]{.underline} in fact [it poisons them. What is said here holds for
**intrinsic goods** **and not just for instrumental
goods.**]{.underline} There remains a distinction between an object\'s
being desired as an end, and its being worth desiring as an end. That
people sometimes come to desire money as an end in itself does not
entail that money is intrinsically desirable. One who would desire money
as an end is simply mistaken or misguided. It is conceivable that some
species could evolve so constituted that the individual has a strong
desire to stand in a corner pummelling his head with a rubber mallet.
The activity would not thereby be intrinsically worthwhile. Rather, we
would have a silly, misdirected creature. The tying of goodness to
desire parallels the often ridiculed tying of an action\'s being good or
right to God\'s commanding it. One asks: Does God command the act
because it is right, or is it right because God commands it? If we take
the former position, we are admitting that the commanding does not make
the act right, and that it must be right on its own account,
independently of being commanded. If we take the latter position we are
stuck with the implication that if God had commanded us to murder and
rape our neighbour rather than to love platonically, these acts would
have been good. But this is preposterous. Given this dilemma, we are
forced to conclude that [an act\'s being right or good could not
originate with its being commanded.]{.underline} The same dilemma arises
for one who would connect goodness to God\'s desires. And this same
dilemma arises for one who would tie goodness to man\'s desires. We are
forced to conclude that an end\'s being good and desirable could not
originate with its being desired and that the thing must be good and
desirable on its own account and independently of being desired. Thus
pleasure\'s being good cannot be a consequence of its being desired.
From this we can conclude, for reasons stated at the beginning of this
section, that [pleasure\'s being good precedes our desire for it and is
our reason for desiring it.]{.underline}

### Hedonism\-\--AT: Evil Pleasures\-\--2NC

#### Reject '[evil pleasures]{.underline}.'

**Chappell and Meissner '23** \[Richard and D; 2023; Associate Professor
of Philosophy at the University of Miami, PhD from Princeton University
in 2012; Philosopher; Utilitarianism, "Theories of Wellbeing,"

[Critics often reject the hedonist claim that all **happiness** is
**good** and all **suffering bad**]{.underline}. [Consider a sadist who
takes pleasure in **harming others** without their consent]{.underline}.
[Hedonists can allow that nonconsensual sadism is typically **overall
harmful**, as the sadist's pleasure is unlikely to outweigh the
**suffering** of their **victim**]{.underline}. This clearly justifies
disapproving of nonconsensual sadism in practice, especially with a
multi-level utilitarian view. Under that view, we might assume that
finding the rare exceptions to this rule would have little practical
value. However, the risk of mistakenly permitting harmful actions means
that we would be better off establishing a general prohibition on
harming others without their consent.

Still, on a purely theoretical level, we may ask: [What if there were
**many sadists**, collectively rejoicing in the suffering of a **single
tortured soul**]{.underline}? If their aggregate pleasure outweighs the
suffering of the one, then hedonistic utilitarianism implies that this
is a good outcome, and the sadists act rightly in torturing their
victim. But that seems wrong.

At this point, [it's worth distinguishing a couple of subtly **different
claims** that one might object to]{.underline}: (i) the [sadists benefit
from their **sadistic pleasure**]{.underline}, and (ii) the [benefits to
the sadists count as **moral goods**]{.underline}, or something that we
should want to promote (all else equal).

[To reject]{.underline} (i) [means rejecting hedonism about
**well-being**]{.underline}. [But if sadistic pleasure does not benefit
the **sadist**]{.underline}, [then this implies that someone who wants
to make the sadist **worse off**]{.underline} (for whatever reason)
[could not achieve that by means of blocking their **sadistic
pleasure**]{.underline}. And that seems mistaken.

Alternatively, one [might retain hedonism about well-being while
respecting our **intuitive opposition**]{.underline} to "evil pleasures"
[by]{.underline} instead rejecting (ii[), and denying that benefiting
sadists at the expense of their victims is **reasonable** or
**good**]{.underline}. This would involve rejecting utilitarianism,
strictly speaking, though a closely related consequentialist view that
merely gives equal weight to all innocent interests (while discounting
illicit interests) remains available, and overlaps with utilitarianism
in the vast majority of cases.

[Hedonistic utilitarians might seek to preserve both (i) and (ii) by
offering an **alternative explanation** of ou**r
intuitions**]{.underline}. For example, [we may judge the sadists'
characters to be bad insofar as they enjoy **hurting
others**]{.underline}, [and so they seem likely to act wrongly in many
**other circumstances**]{.underline}. 8

When "evil" pleasures are detached from their usual consequences, it
becomes much less clear that they are still bad. [Imagine a universe
containing only a single sadist, whose sole enjoyment in life comes from
their false belief that there are other people undergoing **significant
torment**]{.underline}. [Would it really improve things if the sadist's
one source of delight was **taken away** from them]{.underline}? [If
not, then it seems like sadistic pleasure is not **intrinsically bad**
after all]{.underline}. ([Though we can, of course, still disapprove of
its **instrumental badness**]{.underline} in real-life circumstances.)
Even so, if we think it would inherently improve things to replace the
sole inhabitant's sadistic pleasure with an equal amount of non-sadistic
pleasure instead, this might suggest the need for some minor tweaks to
either hedonism or utilitarianism. 9

### Hedonism\-\--AT: Experience Machines\-\--2NC

Robert Nozick [disputed the view that happiness is the only basic good
and suffering the only basic bad by providing a **thought
experiment**]{.underline} [intended to show that we value things other
than **conscious experiences**]{.underline}. Specifically, [Nozick
argued that hedonists are **committed**]{.underline}, mistakenly, [to
plugging into an]{.underline} "**[experience machine]{.underline}**":

[Suppose there were an experience machine that would give you **any
experience** you desired]{.underline}. It could stimulate your brain so
that you would think and feel you were writing a great novel, or making
a friend, or reading an interesting book. [All the time you would be
floating in a tank, with **electrodes** attached to your
**brain**]{.underline}. Should you plug into this machine for life,
pre-programming your life experiences? 10

[Nozick suggests that you **should not plug** into the experience
machine]{.underline}, despite the machine promising a life filled with
much more happiness than "real life". 11

[Most of us do not merely want to passively experience]{.underline}
"**[pre-programmed]{.underline}**" [sensations]{.underline}, however
pleasant they might be; we also want to (i) make real choices, actively
living our lives, 12

and (ii) genuinely interact with others, sharing our lives with real
friends and loved ones. 13

If [happiness were the only basic welfare good, it **would not matter**
whether our experiences were real or were generated by the **experience
machine** without **any input** from]{.underline} us (or others).
Consequently, if we would prefer not to plug into the machine, that
suggests we value things other than just happiness, such as autonomy and
relationships.

[One way that hedonists have tried to resist this **argument** is to
question the **reliability** of the **intuitions** evoked by the
**thought experiment**]{.underline}. In some cases, [reluctance to plug
into the machine might stem from **pragmatic concerns** that the
**technology** may fail]{.underline}. 14 Others might be moved by moral
reasons to remain unplugged (for example, to help others in the real
world), even if that means sacrificing their own happiness. [Finally,
many have argued that our responses to the **thought experiment**
reflect **status quo bias**: if you tell people that they are already in
the **experience machine**, they are much more likely to want to
**remain plugged in**]{.underline}.

of Hume's Law,"
https://daviddfriedman.substack.com/p/a-refutation-of-humes-law;
Accessed 7.22.25\]

[My argument starts with **intuitionism**]{.underline}, [the
philosophical position that holds that just as humans have senses such
as **sight** and **hearing** that imperfectly sense **physical facts**
so we have a moral sense that **imperfectly senses moral
facts**]{.underline}. For a book length exposition see Ethical
Intuitionism by Michael Huemer, for a short sketch, including my
response to obvious counterarguments, Chapter 61 of The Machinery of
Freedom.

[The argument for **intuitionism**]{.underline}, beyond the fact that it
describes how most people feel about morality --- that certain acts
really are wicked --- **[is consistency]{.underline}**. [We believe that
our physical senses are not lying to us about **physical
reality**]{.underline} because what they report usually passes all the
consistency tests we can subject them to, [consistency both between
**information** reported to us by **sight**, **hearing**, **smell** and
**touch** and between the observations of physical reality made by
**different people**]{.underline}. It is possible that it is all an
illusion --- what I know about what other people perceive ultimately
reaches me through my senses, which could all be lying to me --- [but it
is the **best evidence** we have **available**]{.underline}. If moral
perceptions are similarly consistent, if almost everyone, given a
[sufficiently well described situation and action, will have about the
same **moral response**, that would be evidence that there is a **moral
reality** out there which we are **perceiving**]{.underline}.

Whether that situation exists, whether almost everyone has about the
same moral perceptions, is a fact of reality, a non-moral fact. Suppose
it does. One might still reject the conclusion on the basis of an
alternative explanation. Perhaps there are no moral facts, just moral
beliefs, consistent because they were produced by biological evolution
hard wiring into us beliefs that cause us to behave in ways that lead to
reproductive success, or societal evolution producing societies that
indoctrinate their population into the set of moral beliefs that that
make a society more likely to survive.

[This alternative explanation, however, is subject to **factual
tests**]{.underline}. [One could imagine evidence showing that some
widely held moral belief did not contribute to **reproductive success**
or **societal survival**]{.underline}. I do not claim to have any such
evidence but it is at least logically possible. If it existed, and if we
observed consistency across humans of moral judgement, [that would be
evidence for a **moral reality** that humans could **perceive**; their
common perceptions would be evidence of **moral facts** just as
**ordinary perception** is of **physical facts**]{.underline}. [Hence it
is logically possible to deduce **ought** from **is**]{.underline}.

It may be that moral nihilism is correct, that intuitionism and other
forms of moral realism are wrong, that the necessary facts are not true,
but they could be. [Hume's law is not a claim about what facts exist but
about the **logical impossibility** of deducing **moral facts** from
**physical facts and** I believe I have **shown that it is
false**]{.underline}.

University of Singapore, Human Minds and Cultures, 2024, "The Epistemic
Argument for Hedonism," https://philpapers.org/archive/SINTEA-6.pdf

Hedonists can accept synthetic a posteriori identity relations between
moral properties and natural properties, following Peter Railton.34 Just
as electrolyzing water suggests that water is H2O, the argument from
disagreement and phenomenal introspection together suggest that goodness
is pleasure. In both cases, empirical evidence suggests property
identities. While identity permits moral properties to be where
phenomenal introspection could find them, it doesn\'t guarantee this. If
X and Y are identical as a matter of synthetic a posteriori necessity,
one can know that X is present without being in position to know that Y
is present. The advantage of synthetic reductive naturalism is simply
that it puts moral properties in the natural world where they might be
empirically accessible. [To **empirically determine** whether
**phenomenal introspection** actually reveals **moral properties** to
apply to pleasure, we should **introspect** and **see**]{.underline}, as
some [philosophers do]{.underline}. In "The Appeal of Utilitarianism,"
Robert **[Shaver]{.underline}** **[writes]{.underline}** that "[The
**goodness** or **badness** of pleasures or pains is **evident** from
the point of view of **anyone capable of experience**]{.underline}"
(248).35 In Normative Ethics, Shelly **[Kagan]{.underline}** similarly
**[notes]{.underline}** that "The value of **[pleasure]{.underline}**
and the disvalue of pain seem virtually **[self-evident]{.underline}**
to anyone experiencing them" (30).36 [**These philosophers** seem to be
detecting **moral properties** in experience]{.underline}, one of the
many places where synthetic reductionism allows them to be. I\'ll
explain how the structure of moral concepts allows them to do this.

In this section, however, I will offer a solution to this challenge:
what we can call [the **backgrounding move**]{.underline}. This move has
previously been discussed in the literature on desire satisfactionism,
largely in response to independent con- cerns.37 [I will suggest here
that it can provide us with a general solution to the **paradox of
desire satisfaction**]{.underline}.

Up to this point, we have been working with the following formulations
of hedonism, desire satisfactionism, and the hybrid theory:

Hedonism: What is intrinsically good for someone is (just) the pleasure
they experience; what is intrinsically bad for someone is (just) the
dis¬pleasure they experience.

Desire satisfactionism: What is intrinsically good for someone is (just)
the satisfaction of their desires; what is intrinsically bad for someone
is (just) the frustration of their desires.

Hybrid theory: What is intrinsically good for someone is to obtain
\[knowl¬edge, achievement, love, etc.\] while intrinsically desiring to
obtain them.

As we have seen, if welfarism is correct, then these theories imply the
axiological theories that pleasure, desire satisfaction, and the complex
state of desiring an objective good are what are intrinsically
desirable. But if Rational Desire is correct, then rational agents who
believed in these axiological theories would end up desiring nothing
other than pleasure, desire satisfaction, and the relevant complex
states, and thus find themselves experiencing the paradox of desire
satisfaction.

We can avoid this problem, I suggest, by revising how we formulate these
theories. Again, the model for how to do this has been provided in the
litera¬ture on desire satisfactionism.

[There are two standard ways to formulate **desire**
**satisfactionism**]{.underline}: [the satisfaction formulation and the
**object formulation**]{.underline}.38 The satisfaction formula¬tion is
the one presented above. [This claims that what is **intrinsically
good** for **someone**]{.underline} - and therefore, what is
intrinsically good for someone - [is the fact that one of their
**desires** has been **satisfied**]{.underline}. In contrast, [the
object formulation ascribes **intrinsic welfare value** to the
**objects** of our **desires** rather than on the **fact** of **desire**
**satisfaction** itself]{.underline}:

Desire satisfactionism (object formulation[): X is intrinsically good
for S just **when** and **because S desires X**]{.underline}.

The object formulation departs from the satisfaction formulation in its
enu- merative claim: its claim about which natural state intrinsically
contributes to well-being. For example, if I desire to go hiking, the
object formulation claims that hiking will be intrinsically good for me,
not the fact that I am sat¬isfying a desire.

But the object formulation is still recognizably a version of desire
satisfaction¬ism. This is because it retains desire satisfactionism\'s
core explanatory claim: that my welfare is to be explained by the fact
that my desires have been satisfied. But this fact does not itself
contribute to my well-being; rather, it operates in the background,
explaining why the object of my desire makes me better off.

We can now see how agents who accept the object formulation of desire
satisfactionism will be able to avoid the paradox of desire
satisfaction. Again, [if I desire to go hiking, then the object
formulation implies that hiking is **intrinsically good for**
me]{.underline}. [This means that I will rationally be able to desire to
go hiking for its **own sake**]{.underline}. [And since hiking does not
essentially involve **desire satisfaction**]{.underline}, I [will not be
caught in a **vicious circle**]{.underline}; [I can simply go hiking,
and my desire will be **satisfied**]{.underline}.

### Hedonism\-\--AT: Evolutionary Debunking\-\--2NC

#### Reject '[evolutionary debunking]{.underline}'.

Evolutionary Debunking Arguments

[Against these powerful **theoretical objections**]{.underline}, the
main consideration that deontological theories have going for them is
closer conformity with our intuitions about particular cases. [But if
these intuitions cannot be supported by independently **plausible
principles**]{.underline}, that may undermine their force---[or suggest
that we should interpret these intuitions as good rules of thumb for
**practical guidance**]{.underline}, rather than as indicating what
fundamentally matters.

The force of deontological intuitions may also be undermined if it can
be demonstrated that they result from an unreliable process. For
example, evolutionary processes may have endowed us with an emotional
bias favoring those who look, speak, and behave like ourselves; this,
however, offers no justification for discriminating against those unlike
ourselves. Evolution is a blind, amoral process whose only "goal" is the
propagation of genes, not the promotion of well-being or moral
rightness. Our moral intuitions require scrutiny, especially in
scenarios very different from our evolutionary environment. If we
identify a moral intuition as stemming from our evolutionary ancestry,
we may decide not to give much weight to it in our moral reasoning---the
practice of evolutionary debunking. 34

Katarzyna de Lazari-Radek and Peter Singer argue that views permitting
partiality are especially susceptible to evolutionary debunking, whereas
impartial views like utilitarianism are more likely to result from
undistorted reasoning. 35

[Joshua Greene offers a different **psychological debunking
argument**]{.underline}. [He argues that **deontological
judgments**]{.underline}---for instance, in response to trolley
cases---[tend to stem from unreliable and inconsistent **emotional
responses**]{.underline}, [including our favoritism of identifiable over
**faceless victims** and our **aversion** to **harming** someone up
close rather than from afar]{.underline}. [By contrast, utilitarian
judgments involve the more deliberate application of **widely
respected** moral principles]{.underline}. 36

Such debunking arguments raise worries about whether they "prove too
much": after all, the foundational moral judgment that pain is bad would
itself seem emotionally-laden and susceptible to evolutionary
explanation---physically vulnerable creatures would have powerful
evolutionary reasons to want to avoid pain whether or not it was
objectively bad, after all! 37

However, [debunking arguments may be most applicable in cases where we
feel that a principled explanation for the **truth** of the **judgment**
is **lacking**]{.underline}. [We do not tend to feel any such lack
regarding the **badness** of **pain**]{.underline}---[that is surely an
intrinsically plausible judgment if **anything is**]{.underline}. Some
intuitions may be over-determined: [explicable both by **evolutionary**
**causes** and by their **rational merits**]{.underline}. [In such a
case, we need not take the **evolutionary explanation** to undermine the
judgment, because the judgment also results from **a reliable
process**]{.underline} (namely, **[rationality]{.underline}**). By
contrast, [deontological principles and partiality are far less
**self-evidently justified**]{.underline}, and so may be considered more
vulnerable to debunking. Once we have an explanation for these
psychological intuitions that can explain why we would have them even if
they were rationally baseless, we may be more justified in concluding
that they are indeed rationally baseless.

As such, [debunking objections are unlikely to change the mind of one
who is drawn to the **target view**]{.underline} (or regards it as
independently justified and defensible). [But they may help to confirm
the doubts of those who already felt there were some grounds for
scepticism regarding the **intrinsic merits** of **the target
view**]{.underline}.

In the murderer example, [Hegel critiques any ethical system that does

that the **future** will resemble the **past**]{.underline} [and tries
to take their particular lived experience as the

they abstract out their ethical truths from the concrete (i.e., the
lived experience), and absolutize their particular abstraction as the
ethical truth over the concrete reality. Kant is precisely charged with
engaging in this form of abstract thinking concerning his ethical
system, which results in Hegel deeming the CI an \"empty formalism\".

### Consequences\-\--AT: Unforeseen\-\--2NC

#### Consequentialism utilizes [expected]{.underline}, not [actual]{.underline}, consequences.

**Sinnott-Armstrong '23** \[Walter; Winter; Professor of Practical

If overall utility is the criterion of moral rightness, then it might
seem that nobody could know what is morally right. If so, classical
utilitarianism leads to moral skepticism. However, [utilitarians insist
that we can have strong reasons to believe that certain acts **reduce
utility**]{.underline}, [even if we have not yet inspected or predicted
**every consequence** of those acts]{.underline}. For example, [in
normal circumstances, if someone were to torture and kill his
**children**]{.underline}, [it is possible that this would **maximize
utility**]{.underline}, [but that is **very unlikely**]{.underline}.
[Maybe they would have grown up to be mass **murders**]{.underline}, but
it is at least as likely that they would grow up to cure serious
diseases or do **[other great things]{.underline}**, [and it is much
more likely that they would have led **normally happy**]{.underline} (or
at least not destructive) **[lives]{.underline}**. So observers as well
as agents have adequate reasons to believe that such acts are morally
wrong, according to act utilitarianism. In many other cases, it will
still be hard to tell whether an act will maximize utility, but [that
shows only that there are severe **limits** to our **knowledge** of
**what is morally right**.]{.underline} [That should be neither
**surprising** nor **problematic** for **utilitarians**]{.underline}.

If [utilitarians]{.underline} want their theory to allow more moral
knowledge, they can [make a different kind of move by turning from
actual consequences to expected or **expectable
consequences**]{.underline}. [Suppose that Alice finds a runaway
teenager who asks for **money** to get **home**]{.underline}. [Alice
wants to help and reasonably believes that buying a bus ticket home for
this runaway will **help**]{.underline}, so she buys a bus ticket and
puts the runaway on the bus. [Unfortunately, the bus is involved in a
freak accident, and the **runaway** is **killed**]{.underline}. If
actual consequences are what determine moral wrongness, then it was
morally wrong for Alice to buy the bus ticket for this runaway.
Opponents claim that this result is absurd enough to refute classic
utilitarianism.

Some utilitarians bite the bullet and say that Alice's act was morally
wrong, but it was blameless wrongdoing, because her motives were good,
and she was not responsible, given that she could not have foreseen that
her act would cause harm. Since this theory makes actual consequences
determine moral rightness, it can be called actual consequentialism.

Other responses claim that moral rightness depends on foreseen,
foreseeable, intended, or likely consequences, rather than actual ones.
Imagine that Bob does not in fact foresee a bad consequence that would
make his act wrong if he did foresee it, but that Bob could easily have
foreseen this bad consequence if he had been paying attention. Maybe he
does not notice the rot on the hamburger he feeds to his kids which
makes them sick. If foreseen consequences are what matter, then Bob's
act is not morally wrong. If foreseeable consequences are what matter,
then Bob's act is morally wrong, because the bad consequences were
foreseeable. Now consider Bob's wife, Carol, who notices that the meat
is rotten but does not want to have to buy more, so she feeds it to her
children anyway, hoping that it will not make them sick; but it does.
Carol's act is morally wrong if foreseen or foreseeable consequences are
what matter, but not if what matter are intended consequences, because
she does not intend to make her children sick. Finally, consider Bob and
Carol's son Don, who does not know enough about food to be able to know
that eating rotten meat can make people sick. If Don feeds the rotten
meat to his little sister, and it makes her sick, then the bad
consequences are not intended, foreseen, or even foreseeable by Don, but
those bad results are still objectively likely or probable, unlike the
case of Alice. Some philosophers deny that probability can be fully
objective, but at least the consequences here are foreseeable by others
who are more informed than Don can be at the time. For Don to feed the
rotten meat to his sister is, therefore, morally wrong if likely
consequences are what matter, but not morally wrong if what matter are
foreseen or foreseeable or intended consequences.

Consequentialist moral theories that focus on actual or objectively
probable consequences are often described as objective consequentialism
(Railton 1984). In contrast, consequentialist moral theories that focus
on intended or foreseen consequences are usually described as subjective
consequentialism. [Consequentialist moral theories that focus on
**reasonably foreseeable consequences** are then **not subjective**
insofar as they do not depend on anything inside the **actual subject's
mind,**]{.underline} but they are subjective insofar as they do depend
on which consequences this particular subject would foresee if he or she
were better informed or more rational.

One final solution to these epistemological problems deploys the legal
notion of proximate cause. [If consequentialists define consequences in
terms of what is **caused**]{.underline} (unlike Sosa 1993), then [which
future events count as consequences is affected by which notion of
causation is used to define **consequences**]{.underline}. [Suppose I
give a set of **steak knives** to a **friend**]{.underline}.
[**Unforeseeably**, when she opens my present, the decorative pattern on
the knives somehow reminds her of **something horrible** that her
husband did]{.underline}. [This memory makes her so angry that she
voluntarily stabs and **kills him** with one of the knives]{.underline}.
[She would not have killed her husband if I had given her **spoons**
instead of **knives**]{.underline}. [Did my decision or my act of giving
her knives cause her **husband's death**]{.underline}? [Most
**people**]{.underline} (and the law) [would say that the cause was
**her act**, not **mine**]{.underline}. Why? One explanation is that
[her voluntary act intervened in the **causal chain** between my act and
her **husband's death**]{.underline}. Moreover, [even if she did not
voluntarily kill him, but instead she **slipped** and **fell** on the
**knives**]{.underline}, thereby killing herself, [my gift would still
not be a cause of her death, because the **coincidence** of her
**falling** intervened between my act and her **death**]{.underline}.
The point is that, [when voluntary acts and coincidences intervene in
**certain causal chains**]{.underline}, then the [results are not seen
as caused by the acts further back in the chain of **necessary
conditions**]{.underline} (Hart and Honoré 1985). Now, if we assume that
an act must be such a proximate cause of a harm in order for that harm
to be a consequence of that act, then [consequentialists can claim that
the moral rightness of that act is determined only by such **proximate
consequences**]{.underline}. This position, which might be called
proximate consequentialism, makes it much easier for agents and
observers to justify moral judgments of acts because it obviates the
need to predict non-proximate consequences in distant times and places.
Hence, this move is worth considering, even though it has never been
developed as far as I know and deviates far from traditional
consequentialism, which counts not only proximate consequences but all
upshots --- that is, everything for which the act is a causally
necessary condition.

### Consequences\-\--AT: Uncertainty\-\--2NC

#### Consequentialism is a [criterion]{.underline}, not a [procedure]{.underline}.

**Sinnott-Armstrong '23** \[Walter; Winter; Professor of Practical
Ethics in the Department of Philosophy and the Kenan Institute for
Ethics at Duke; SEP, "Consequentialism,"
https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/#WhicConsActuVsExpeCons;
Accessed 7.22.25\]

A second set of problems for classic utilitarianism is epistemological.
Classic utilitarianism seems to require that agents calculate all
consequences of each act for every person for all time. That's
impossible.

This objection rests on a misinterpretation. [These critics assume that
the principle of utility is supposed to be used as a decision
**procedure** or **guide**]{.underline}, that is, [as a method that
agents co**nsciously apply** to acts in advance to help them make
**decisions**]{.underline}. [However, most classic and contemporary
utilitarians and consequentialists do not propose their principles as
**decision procedures**]{.underline}. (Bales 1971) Bentham wrote, "It is
not to be expected that this process \[his hedonic calculus\] should be
strictly pursued previously to every moral judgment." (1789, Chap. IV,
Sec. VI) Mill agreed, "it is a misapprehension of the utilitarian mode
of thought to conceive it as implying that people should fix their minds
upon so wide a generality as the world, or society at large." (1861,
Chap. II, Par. 19) Sidgwick added, "It is [not necessary that the end
which gives the criterion of rightness should always be the end at which
we **consciously aim**]{.underline}." (1907, 413)

Instead, most [consequentialists claim that overall utility is the
**criterion** or standard of what is morally **right** or morally
**ought** to be **done**]{.underline}. Their [theories are intended to
spell out the necessary and sufficient conditions for an act to be
**morally right**]{.underline}, [regardless of whether the agent can
tell in advance whether those **conditions** are met]{.underline}. [Just
as the laws of physics govern **golf ball flight,** but golfers need not
calculate **physical forces** while planning]{.underline}
**[shots]{.underline}**; so overall [utility can determine which
decisions are **morally right**, even if agents need not **calculate
utilities** while making **decisions**]{.underline}. [If the principle
of utility is used as a criterion of the right rather than as a decision
procedure, then **classical** **utilitarianism** does not require that
anyone know the total **consequences of** anything before **making** a
**decision**]{.underline}.

Furthermore, a utilitarian criterion of right implies that it would not
be morally right to use the principle of utility as a decision procedure
in cases where it would not maximize utility to try to calculate
utilities before acting. Utilitarians regularly argue that most people
in most circumstances ought not to try to calculate utilities, because
they are too likely to make serious miscalculations that will lead them
to perform actions that reduce utility. It is even possible to hold that
most agents usually ought to follow their moral intuitions, because
these intuitions evolved to lead us to perform acts that maximize
utility, at least in likely circumstances (Hare 1981, 46--47). Some
utilitarians (Sidgwick 1907, 489--90) suggest that a utilitarian
decision procedure may be adopted as an esoteric morality by an elite
group that is better at calculating utilities, but utilitarians can,
instead, hold that nobody should use the principle of utility as a
decision procedure.

This move is supposed to make consequentialism self-refuting, according
to some opponents. However, [there is nothing incoherent about proposing
a **decision procedure that** is separate from one's criterion of the
**right**]{.underline}. Similar distinctions apply in other normative
realms[. The criterion of a good **stock investment** is its **total
return**, but the best decision procedure still might be to reduce risk
by buying an index fund or **blue-chip stocks**.]{.underline} Criteria
can, thus, be self-effacing without being self-refuting (Parfit 1984,
chs. 1 and 4).

### Extinction\-\--1NC

#### Extinction is the worst possible outcome. 4 reasons.

What could be wrong with human extinction?

Many, though certainly not all, people might believe that it would be
wrong to bring about the end of the human species, and the reasons given
for this belief are various. I begin by considering [four
reasons]{.underline} that could be [given against the **moral
permissibility** of human extinction.]{.underline} I will argue that
only those reasons that impact the people who exist at the time that the
extinction or the knowl edge of the upcoming extinction occurs, can
explain its wrongness. I use this conclusion to then consider in which
cases human extinction would be morally permissible or impermissible,
arguing that there is only a small class of cases in which it would not
be wrong to cause the extinction of the human race or allow it to
happen. 2.1. It would [prevent the existence of very many happy
people]{.underline} One reason of human [extinction]{.underline} might
be considered [to be wrong lies in]{.underline} the **[value of human
life]{.underline}** itself. The thought here might be that it is a good
thing for people to exist and enjoy happy lives and extinction would
deprive more people 330 ® E. FINNERON-BURNS of enjoying this good. The
\'good\' in this case could be understood in at least two ways.
According to thefirst, one might believe that you benefit a person by
bringing them into existence, or at least, that it is good for that
person that they come to exist. The second view might hold that if
humans were to go extinct, the utility foregone by the billions (or
more) of people who could have lived but will now never get that
opportunity, renders allowing human extinction to take place an
incidence of wrongdoing. An example of this view can be found in two
quotes from an Effective Altruism blog post by Peter Singer, Nick
Beckstead and Matt Wage: One very [bad thing about]{.underline} human
[extinction would be that billions **of people would likely die painful
deaths.**]{.underline} But in our view, this is by far not the worst
thing about human extinction. [The worst thing about human extinction is
that there would be **no future generations.**]{.underline} Since there
could be [so many generations in our future, the value of all those
generations together greatly exceeds]{.underline} the value of the
[current generation.]{.underline} (Beckstead, Singer, and Wage 2013) The
authors are making two claims. The first is that there is value in human
life and also something valuable about creating future people which
gives us a reason to do so; furthermore, it would be a very bad thing if
we did not do so. The second is that, not only would it be a bad thing
for there to be no future people, but it would actually be the worst
thing about extinction. Since happy human lives have value, and [the
number of potential people who could ever exist is far
greater]{.underline} than the number of people who exist at any one
time, even if the extinction were brought about through the painful
deaths of currently existing people, the former\'s loss would be greater
than the latter\'s. Both claims are assuming that [there is an intrinsic
value in the existence of potential human life.]{.underline} The second
claim makes the further assumption that the forgone value of the
potential lives that could be lived is greater than the disvalue that
would be accrued by people existing at the time of the extinction
through suffering from painful and/or premature deaths. The best-known
author of the post, Peter Singer is a prominent utilitarian, so it is
not surprising that he would lament the potential lack of future human
lives per se. However, it is [not just utilitarians who share this
view,]{.underline} even if implicitly. Indeed, [other
phil]{.underline}osophers also seem to [imply]{.underline} that they
share the intuition that [there is just something wrong with causing or
failing to prevent the extinction of the human species]{.underline} such
that we prevent more \'people\' from having the\'opportunity to exist\'.
Stephen Gardiner (2009) and Martin O\'Neill (personal correspondence),
both sympathetic to contract theory, for example, also find it intuitive
that we should want more generations to have the opportunity to exist,
assuming that they have worth-living lives, and I find it plausible to
think that many other people (philosophers and non-philosophers alike)
probably share this intuition. CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY @ 331 When
we talk about future lives being \'prevented; we are saying that a pos
sible person or a set of possible people who could potentially have
existed will now never actually come to exist. To say that it is wrong
to prevent people from existing could either mean that a possible person
could reasonably reject a principle that permitted us not to create
them, or that the foregone value of their lives provides a reason for
rejecting any principle that permits extinction. To make the first claim
we would have to argue that a possible person could reasonably reject
any principle that prevented their existence on the grounds that it
prevented them in particular from existing. However, this is implausible
for two reasons. First, we can only wrong someone who did, does or will
actually exist because wronging involves failing to take a person\'s
interests into account. When con sidering the permissibility of a
principle allowing us not to create Person X, we cannot takers interest
in being created into account becauseXwill not exist if we follow the
principle. By considering the standpoint of a person in our deliber
ations we consider the burdens they will have to bear as a result of the
principle. In this case, there is no one who will bear any burdens since
if the principle is followed (that is, if we do not create X),X will not
exist to bear any burdens. So, only people who do/will actually exist
can bear the brunt of a principle, and therefore occupy a standpoint
that is owed justification. Second, existence is not an interest at all
and a possible person is not dis advantaged by not being caused to
exist. Rather than being an interest, it is a necessary requirement in
order to have interests. Rivka Weinberg describes it as
\'neutral\'because causing a person to exist is to create a subject who
can have interests; existence is not an interest itself.3 In order to be
disadvantaged, there must be some detrimental effect on your interests.
However, without existence, a person does not have any interests so they
cannot be disadvantaged by being kept out of existence. But, as Weinberg
points out, \'never having interests itself could not be contrary to
people\'s interests since without interest bearers, there can be no
\'they\'for it to be bad for\' (Weinberg 2008, 13). So, a principle that
results in some possible people never becoming actual does not impose
any costs on those\'people\'because nobody is disadvantaged by not
coming into existence.4 It therefore seems that it cannot be wrong to
fail to bring particular peo ple into existence. This would mean that no
one acts wrongly when they fail to create another person. Writ large, it
would also not be wrong if everybody decided to exercise their
prerogative not to create new people and potentially, by consequence,
allow human extinction. One might respond here by saying that although
it may be permissible for one person to fail to create a new person, it
is not permissible if everyone chooses to do so because human lives have
value and allowing human extinc tion would be to forgo a huge amount of
value in the world. This takes us to the second way of understanding the
potential wrongness of preventing people 332 @ E. FINNERON-BURNS from
existing --- the foregone value of a life provides a reason for
rejecting any principle that prevents it. One possible reply to this
claim turns on the fact that many philosophers acknowledge that the
only, or at least the best, way to think about the value of (individual
or groups of) possible people\'s lives is in impersonal terms (Parfit
1984; Reiman 2007; McMahan 2009). Jeff McMahan, for example, writes\'at
the time of one\'s choice there is no one who exists or will exist
independently of that choice for whose sake one could be acting in
causing him or her to exist \... it seems therefore that any reason to
cause or not to cause an individual to exist\... is best considered an
impersonal rather than individual-affecting reason\' (McMahan 2009,52).
Another reply along similar lines would be to appeal to the value that
is lost or at least foregone when we fail to bring into existence a next
(or several next) generations of people with worth-living lives. Since
exhypothesi worth-living lives have positive value, it is better to
create more such lives and worse to cre ate fewer. [Human extinction by
definition is the creation of **no future lives** and would
**\'deprive\'billions of\'people\'of the opportunity to live
worth-living lives.**]{.underline} This might [reduce the amount of
value in the world]{.underline} at the time of the extinction (by
killing already existing people), but it would also prevent a much
vaster amount of value in the future (by failing to create more people).
Both replies depend on the impersonal value of human life. However,
recall that in contractualism impersonal values are not on their own
grounds for reasonably rejecting principles. Scanlon himself says that
although we have a strong reason not to destroy existing human lives,
this reason \'does not flow from the thought that it is a good thing for
there to be more human life rather than less\'O 04). In contractualism,
something cannot be wrong unless there is an impact on a person. Thus,
neither the impersonal value of creating a particular person nor the
impersonal value of human life writ large could on its own provide a
reason for rejecting a principle permitting human extinction. It seems
therefore that the fact that extinction would deprive future people of
the opportunity to live worth-living lives (either by failing to create
either particular future people or future people in general) cannot
provide us with a reason to consider human extinction to be wrong.
Although the lost value of these\'lives\'itself cannot be the reason
explaining the wrongness of extinction, it is possible the knowledge of
this loss might create a personal reason for some existing people. I
will consider this possibility later on in section (d). But first I move
to the [second reason]{.underline} human extinction might be wrong
perse. 2.2. It would mean [the loss of the only known form of
intelligent life and all civilization and intellectual
progress]{.underline} would be lost A second reason we might think it
would be wrong to cause human extinc tion is the loss that would occur
of the only (known) form of rational life and CANADIAN JOURNAL OF
PHILOSOPHY @ 333 the knowledge and civilization that that form of life
has created. One thought here could be that just as some might consider
it wrong to destroy an individ ual human heritage monument like the
Sphinx, [it would also be wrong if the advances made by humans over the
past few millennia were lost or prevented from
**progressing.**]{.underline} A related argument is made by those who
feel that there is something special about [humans\' capacity for
rationality which is valuable in itself.]{.underline} Since humans are
the only intelligent life that we know of, it would be a loss, in
itself, to the world for that to end. I admit that I struggle to fully
appreciate this thought. It seems to me that Henry Sidgwick was correct
in thinking that these things are only important insofar as they are
important to humans (Sidgwick 1874,1.IX.4).5 If there is no form of
intelligent life in the future, who would there be to lament its loss
since intelligent life is the only form of life capable of appreciating
intelligence? Similarly, if there is no one with the rational capacity
to appreciate historic monuments and civil progress, who would there be
to be negatively affected or even notice the loss?6 However, even if
there is nothing special about human rationality, just as some people
try to prevent the extinction of nonhuman animal species, we might think
that we ought also to prevent human extinction for the sake of
biodiversity. The thought in this, as well as the earlier examples, must
be that it would somehow be bad for the world if there were no more
humans even though there would be no one for whom it is bad. This may be
so but the only way to understand this reason is impersonally. Since we
are concerned with wrongness rather than badness, we must ask whether
something that impacts no one\'s well-being, status or claims can be
wrong. As we saw earlier, in the contractualist framework reasons must
be personal rather than impersonal in order to provide grounds for
reasonable rejection (Scanlon 1998, 218-223). Since the loss of
civilization, intelligent life or biodiversity are per se impersonal
reasons, there is no standpoint from which these reasons could be used
to reasonably reject a principle that permitted extinction. Therefore,
causing human extinction on the grounds of the loss of civilization,
rational life or biodiversity would not be wrong. 2.[3. Existing people
would endure physical pain and/or painful and/or premature
deaths]{.underline} Thinking about the ways in which human extinction
might come about brings to the fore two more reasons it might be wrong.
It could, for example, occur if all humans (or at least the critical
number needed to be unable to replenish the population, leading to
eventual extinction) underwent a sterilization pro cedure. Or perhaps it
could [come about due to]{.underline} anthropogenic [climate change or a
massive asteroid]{.underline} hitting the Earth and wiping out the
species in the same way it did the dinosaurs millions of years ago.
[Each of these scenarios would]{.underline} 334 @ E. FINNERON-BURNS
involve [significant physical and/or non-physical harms to existing
people and their interests. Physically, people might suffer premature
and possibly also painful deaths,]{.underline} for example. It is not
hard to imagine examples in which the process of extinc tion could cause
premature death. A nuclear winter that killed everyone or even just
every woman under the age of 50 is a clear example of such a case.
Obviously, some types of premature death themselves cannot be reasons to
reject a principle. Every person dies eventually, sometimes earlier than
the stand ard expected lifespan due to accidents or causes like
spontaneously occurring incurable cancers. A cause such as disease is
not a moral agent and therefore it cannot be wrong if it unavoidably
kills a person prematurely. Scanlon says that the fact that a principle
would reduce a person\'s well-being gives that person a reason to reject
the principle: \'components of well-being figure prominently as grounds
for reasonable rejection\' (Scanlon 1998, 214). However, it is not
settled yet whether premature death is a setback to well-being. Some
philosophers hold that death is a harm to the person who dies, whilst
oth ers argue that it is not.71 will argue, however, that regardless of
who is correct in that debate, [being caused to die prematurely can be
reason to reject a principle when it **fails to show respect to the
person as a rational agent**.]{.underline} Scanlon says that recognizing
others as rational beings with interests involves seeing reason to
preserve life and prevent death: \'appreciating the value of human life
is primarily a matter of seeing human lives as something to be
respected, where this involves seeing reasons not to destroy them,
reasons to protect them, and reasons to want them to go well\' (Scanlon
1998, 104). The \'respect for life\' in this case is a respect for the
person living, not respect for human life in the abstract. This means
that we can sometimes fail to protect human life without acting
wrongfully if we still respect the person living. Scanlon gives the
example of a person who faces a life of unending and extreme pain such
that she wishes to end it by committing suicide. Scanlon does not think
that the suicidal person shows a lack of respect for her own life by
seeking to end it because the person whose life it is has no reason to
want it to go on. This is important to note because it emphasizes the
fact that the respect for human life is person-affecting. It is not
wrong to murder because of the impersonal disvalue of death in general,
but because taking someone\'s life without their permission shows
disrespect to that person. This supports its inclusion as a reason in
the contractualist formula, regardless of what side ends up winning the
\'is death a harm?\'debate because [even if death turns out not to harm
the person who died, **ending their life without their consent shows
disrespect to that person.**]{.underline} A person who could reject a
principle permitting another to cause his or her premature death
presumably does not wish to die at that time, or in that man ner. Thus,
if they are killed without their consent, their interests have not been
taken into account, and they have a reason to reject the principle that
allowed CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY @ 335 their premature death.8This
is as true in the case of death due to extinction as it is for death due
to murder. However, [physical pain may also be caused to existing
people]{.underline} without killing them, [but still resulting in human
extinction.]{.underline} Imagine, for example, surgically removing
everyone\'s reproductive organs in order to prevent the creation of any
future people. Another example could be a nuclear bomb that did not kill
anyone, but did painfully render them infertile through illness or
injury. These would be cases in which physical pain (through surgery or
bombs) was inflicted on existing people and the extinction came about as
a result of the painful incident rather than through death. Furthermore,
one could imagine a situation in which a bomb (for example) killed
enough people to cause extinction, but some people remained alive, but
in terrible pain from injuries. It seems uncontroversial that the
infliction of physical pain could be a reason to reject a principle.
Although Scanlon says that an impact on well-being is not the only
reason to reject principles, it plays a significant role, and indeed,
most principles are likely to be rejected due to a negative impact on a
person\'s well-being, physical or otherwise. It may be queried here
whether it is actually the involuntariness of the pain that is grounds
for reasonable rejection rather than the physical pain itself because
not all pain that a person suffers is involuntary. One can imagine acts
that can cause physical pain that are not rejectable --- base jumping or
life-sav ing or improving surgery, for example. On the other hand,
pushing someone off a cliff or cutting him with a scalpel against his
will are clearly rejectable acts. The difference between the two cases
is that in the former, the person having the pain inflicted has
consented to that pain or risk of pain. My view is that they cannot be
separated in these cases and it is involuntary physical pain that is the
grounds for reasonable rejection. Thus, the fact that a principle would
allow unwanted physical harm gives a person who would be subjected to
that harm a reason to reject the principle. Of course the mere fact that
a principle causes involuntary physical harm or premature death is not
sufficient to declare that the principle is rejectable --- there might
be countervailing reasons. In the case of extinction, what coun
tervailing reasons might be offered in favour of the involuntary
physical pain/ death-inducing harm? One such reason that might be
offered is that humans are a harm to the natural environment and that
the world might be a better place if there were no humans in it. It
could be that humans might rightfully be considered an
all-things-considered hindrance to the world rather than a ben efit to
it given the fact that we have been largely responsible for the
extinction of many species, pollution and, most recently, climate change
which have all negatively affected the natural environment in ways we
are only just beginning to understand.Thus, the fact that human
extinction would improve the natural environment (or at least prevent it
from degrading further), is a countervailing reason in favour of
extinction to be weighed against the reasons held by humans 336 ® E.
FINNERON-BURNS who would experience physical pain or premature death.
However, the good of the environment as described above is by definition
not a personal reason. Just like the loss of rational life and
civilization, therefore, it cannot be a reason on its own when
determining what is wrong and countervail the strong personal reasons to
avoid pain/death that is held by the people who would suffer from it.9
Every person existing at the time of the extinction would have a reason
to reject that principle on the grounds of the physical pain they are
being forced to endure against their will that could not be
countervailed by impersonal con siderations such as the negative impact
humans may have on the earth. Therefore, [a principle that permitted
extinction to be accomplished in a way that caused **involuntary
physical pain or premature death** could quite clearly be
rejectable]{.underline} by existing people with no relevant
countervailing reasons. This means that human extinction that came about
in this way would be wrong. There are of course also additional reasons
they could reject a similar principle which I now turn to address in the
next section. 2.4. Existing people could endure non-physical harms I
said earlier than the fact in itself that there would not be any future
people is an impersonal reason and can therefore not be a reason to
reject a principle permitting extinction. However, this impersonal
reason could give rise to a per sonal reason that is admissible. So, the
[final important reason]{.underline} people might think that human
extinction would be wrong is that [there could be various **deleterious
psychological effects** that would be endured by existing people having
the knowledge that there would be no future generations.]{.underline}
There are [two main sources of this trauma]{.underline}, both arising
from the knowledge that there will be no more people. The
[first]{.underline} relates to [individual people and the undesired
negative effect on well-being that would be experienced by those who
would have wanted to have children.]{.underline} Whilst this is by no
means universal, it is fair to say that a good propor tion of people
feel a strong pull towards reproduction and having their lineage
continue in some way. Samuel Scheffler describes the pull towards
reproduction as a\'desire for a personalized relationship with the
future\'(Scheffler 2012, 31). Reproducing is a widely held desire and
the joys of parenthood are ones that many people wish to experience. For
these people knowing that they would not have descendants (or that their
descendants will endure painful and/or premature deaths) could create a
sense of despair and pointlessness of life. Furthermore, [the inability
to reproduce and have your own children because of a
principle/policy]{.underline} that prevents you (either through bans or
physical inter ventions) [would be a significant infringement
of]{.underline} what we consider to be [a basic right to control what
happens to your body.]{.underline} For these reasons, knowing that you
will have no descendants could cause significant psychological traumas
or harms even if there were no associated physical harm.

### Extinction\-\--Cognitive Bias\-\--2NC

#### Extinction isn't a settler fantasy\-\--it's [systematically underestimated]{.underline}:

#### 1. Availability bias.

1: Availability

Suppose you randomly sample a word of three or more letters from an
English text. Is it more likely that the word starts with an R
(\"rope\"), or that R is its third letter (\"park\")?

A [general principle underlying the **heuristics-and-biases program** is
that human beings use methods of thought -]{.underline} heuristics -
which quickly return good approximate answers in many cases; but which
also give rise to systematic errors called biases. [An example of a
heuristic is to judge the **frequency** or **probability** of an event
by its **availability**]{.underline}, the ease with which examples of
the event come to mind. R appears in the third-letter position of more
English words than in the first-letter position, yet it is much easier
to recall words that begin with \"R\" than words whose third letter is
\"R\". Thus, a majority of respondents guess that words beginning with
\"R\" are more frequent, when the reverse is the case. (Tversky and
Kahneman 1973.)

[Biases implicit in the availability heuristic affect **estimates of
risk**]{.underline}. A pioneering study by Lichtenstein et. al. (1978)
examined absolute and relative probability judgments of risk. [People
know in general terms which risks cause **large** **numbers** of
**deaths** and which cause few deaths]{.underline}. [However, asked to
quantify risks more precisely, people **severely overestimate** the
frequency of rare causes of death, and **severely underestimate** the
frequency of common causes of death]{.underline}. Other repeated errors
were also apparent: Accidents were judged to cause as many deaths as
disease. (Diseases cause about 16 times as many deaths as accidents.)
Homicide was incorrectly judged a more frequent cause of death than
diabetes, or stomach cancer. A followup study by Combs and Slovic (1979)
tallied reporting of deaths in two newspapers, and found that errors in
probability judgments correlated strongly (.85 and .89) with selective
reporting in newspapers.

People refuse to buy flood insurance even when it is heavily subsidized
and priced far below an actuarially fair value. Kunreuther et. al.
(1993) suggests underreaction to threats of flooding may arise from
\"the inability of individuals to conceptualize floods that have never
occurred\... Men on flood plains appear to be very much prisoners of
their experience\... Recently experienced floods appear to set an upward
bound to the size of loss with which managers believe they ought to be
concerned.\" Burton et. al. (1978) report that when dams and levees are
built, they reduce the frequency of floods, and thus apparently create a
false sense of security, leading to reduced precautions. While building
dams decreases the frequency of floods, damage per flood is so much
greater afterward that the average yearly damage increases.

It seems that [people do not **extrapolate** from experienced **small
hazards** to a possibility of **large risks**]{.underline};
[rather]{.underline}, the [past experience of small hazards sets a
perceived **upper bound** on risks]{.underline}. A [society
well-protected against minor hazards will **take no action** against
major risks]{.underline} (building on flood plains once the regular
minor floods are eliminated). A [society subject to regular minor
hazards will treat those minor hazards as an upper bound on the size of
the risks]{.underline} (guarding against regular minor floods but not
occasional major floods).

[Risks of **human extinction** may tend to be **underestimated**
since]{.underline}, obviously, [humanity has **never yet encountered**
an extinction event]{.underline}.

#### 2. Hindsight bias.

**Yudkowsky '06** \[Eliezer; August 31; American writer and researcher
in artificial intelligence (AI) who advocates for Friendly AI (FAI) and
the Singularity; UC Berkeley Statistics Department, "Cognitive biases
potentially affecting judgment of global risks,"

accessed: 7.22.25\]

[**Hindsight bias** is when subjects, **after learning** the eventual
**outcome**]{.underline}, [give a much **higher estimate** for the
**predictability** of that outcome than subjects who predict the outcome
without **advance knowledge**]{.underline}. Hindsight bias is sometimes
called the I-knew-it-all-along effect.

Fischhoff and Beyth (1975) presented students with historical accounts
of unfamiliar incidents, such as a conflict between the Gurkhas and the
British in 1814. Given the account as background knowledge, five groups
of students were asked what they would have predicted as the probability
for each of four outcomes: British victory, Gurkha victory, stalemate
with a peace settlement, or stalemate with no peace settlement. Four
experimental groups were respectively told that these four outcomes were
the historical outcome. The fifth, control group was not told any
historical outcome. In every case, a group told an outcome assigned
substantially higher probability to that outcome, than did any other
group or the control group.

Hindsight bias is important in legal cases, where a judge or jury must
determine whether a defendant was legally negligent in failing to
foresee a hazard (Sanchiro 2003). In an experiment based on an actual
legal case, Kamin and Rachlinski (1995) [asked **two groups** to
**estimate** the **probability** of **flood damage** caused by blockage
of a city-owned drawbridge]{.underline}. [The **control group** was told
only the background **information known** to the city when it decided
not to hire a bridge watcher]{.underline}. The [**experimental group**
was given this information, plus the fact that a **flood** had actually
occurred]{.underline}. [Instructions stated the city was **negligent**
if the **foreseeable probability** of flooding was greater than
**10%**]{.underline}. [**76%** of the control group concluded the flood
was so unlikely that **no precautions** were **necessary**; **57%** of
the experimental group concluded the flood was so likely that failure to
take precautions was **legally negligent**]{.underline}. A third
experimental group was told the outcome and also explicitly instructed
to avoid hindsight bias, which made no difference: 56% concluded the
city was legally negligent. Judges cannot simply instruct juries to
avoid hindsight bias; that debiasing manipulation has no significant
effect.

[Viewing history through the lens of hindsight]{.underline}, [we
**vastly underestimate** the **cost** of preventing
catastrophe]{.underline}. [In 1986, the space shuttle Challenger
exploded for reasons eventually traced to an O-ring losing
flexibility]{.underline} at low temperature. (Rogers et. al. 1986.)
[There were warning signs]{.underline} of a problem with the O-rings.
[But preventing the **Challenger disaster** would have required, not
attending to the problem with the O-rings, but attending to **every
warning sign** which **seemed as severe** as the O-ring problem, without
**benefit of hindsight**]{.underline}.

#### 3. [Conjuctive fallacy]{.underline}\-\--despite what [soft left teams]{.underline} will [tell you]{.underline}, it's a [neg warrant]{.underline}! Every piece of [case defense]{.underline} [increases the risk]{.underline} of the aff!

Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored
in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of
discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear
demonstrations.

[Rank the **following statements** from most **probable** to **least
probable**]{.underline}:

1\. Linda is a teacher in an elementary school.

2\. Linda works in a bookstore and takes Yoga classes.

3\. Linda is active in the feminist movement.

4\. Linda is a psychiatric social worker.

5\. Linda is a member of the League of Women Voters.

[**6.** Linda is a **bank teller**]{.underline}.

7\. Linda is an insurance salesperson.

[**8.** Linda is a **bank teller** and is active in the **feminist
movement**]{.underline}.

[**89%** of **88** undergraduate subjects ranked (**8**) as more
probable than (**6**)]{.underline}. (Tversky and Kahneman 1982.) Since
the given description of Linda was chosen to be similar to a feminist
and dissimilar to a bank teller, (8) is more representative of Linda\'s
description. [However]{.underline}, [ranking (8) as more probable than
(6) violates the conjunction rule of probability theory which states
that p(A & B) ≤ p(A). Imagine a sample of **1,000 women**; surely more
women in this sample are **bank tellers** than are **feminist bank
tellers**]{.underline}.

Could the conjunction fallacy rest on subjects interpreting the
experimental instructions in an unanticipated way? Perhaps subjects
think that by \"probable\" is meant the probability of Linda\'s
description given statements (6) and (8), rather than the probability of
(6) and (8) given Linda\'s description. Or perhaps subjects interpret
(6) to mean \"Linda is a bank teller and is not active in the feminist
movement.\" Although many creative alternative hypotheses have been
invented to explain away the conjunction fallacy, the [conjunction
fallacy has **survived all experimental tests** meant to **disprove
it**]{.underline}; see e.g. Sides et. al. (2002) for a summary. For
example, the following experiment excludes both of the alternative
hypotheses proposed above:

Consider a regular six-sided die with four green faces and two red
faces. The die will be rolled 20 times and the sequence of greens (G)
and reds (R) will be recorded. You are asked to select one sequence,
from a set of three, and you will win \$25 if the sequence you chose
appears on successive rolls of the die. Please check the sequence of
greens and reds on which you prefer to bet.

1\. RGRRR

2\. GRGRRR

3\. GRRRRR

125 undergraduates at UBC and Stanford University played this gamble
with real payoffs. 65% of subjects chose sequence (2). (Tversky and
Kahneman 1983.) Sequence (2) is most representative of the die, since
the die is mostly green and sequence (2) contains the greatest
proportion of green faces. However, sequence (1) dominates sequence (2)
because (1) is strictly included in (2) - to get (2) you must roll (1)
preceded by a green face.

In the above task, [the **exact probabilities** for each event could in
principle have been **calculated** by the students]{.underline}.
[However, rather than go to the effort of a numerical
calculation]{.underline}, [it would seem that (at least 65% of) the
students made an **intuitive guess**]{.underline}, based on which
sequence seemed most \"representative\" of the die. Calling this \"the
representativeness heuristic\" does not imply that students deliberately
decided that they would estimate probability by estimating similarity.
Rather, the representativeness heuristic is what produces the intuitive
sense that sequence 2 \"seems more likely\" than sequence 1. In other
words, the \"representativeness heuristic\" is a built-in feature of the
brain for producing rapid probability judgments, rather than a
consciously adopted procedure. We are not aware of substituting judgment
of representativeness for judgment of probability.

The [conjunction fallacy similarly applies to **futurological
forecasts**]{.underline}. Two independent sets of professional analysts
at the Second [International Congress on Forecasting were asked to
rate]{.underline}, respectively, the [**probability** of \"A **complete
suspension** of diplomatic relations between the USA and the Soviet
Union, sometime in **1983**\" or \"A **Russian invasion** of Poland, and
a **complete susp**ension of diplomatic relations between the USA and
the Soviet Union, sometime in 1983]{.underline}\". The [second set of
analysts responded with **significantly higher
probabilities**]{.underline}. (Tversky and Kahneman 1983.)

In Johnson et. al. (1993), MBA students at Wharton were scheduled to
travel to Bangkok as part of their degree program. Several groups of
students were asked how much they were willing to pay for terrorism
insurance. One group of subjects was asked how much they were willing to
pay for terrorism insurance covering the flight from Thailand to the US.
A second group of subjects was asked how much they were willing to pay
for terrorism insurance covering the round-trip flight. A third group
was asked how much they were willing to pay for terrorism insurance that
covered the complete trip to Thailand. These three groups responded with
average willingness to pay of \$17.19, \$13.90, and \$7.44 respectively.

According to probability theory, adding additional detail onto a story
must render the story less probable. It is less probable that Linda is a
feminist bank teller than that she is a bank teller, since all feminist
bank tellers are necessarily bank tellers. Yet human psychology seems to
follow the rule that adding an additional detail can make the story more
plausible.

People might pay more for international diplomacy intended to prevent
nanotechnological warfare by China, than for an engineering project to
defend against nanotechnological attack from any source. The second
threat scenario is less vivid and alarming, but the defense is more
useful because it is more vague. More valuable still would be strategies
which make humanity harder to extinguish without being specific to
nanotechnologic threats - such as colonizing space, or see Yudkowsky
(this volume) on AI. Security expert Bruce Schneier observed (both
before and after the 2005 hurricane in New Orleans) that the U.S.
government was guarding specific domestic targets against \"movie-plot
scenarios\" of terrorism, at the cost of taking away resources from
emergency-response capabilities that could respond to any disaster.
(Schneier 2005.)

**[Overly detailed reassurances]{.underline}** can also [create **false
perceptions of safety**]{.underline}: \"[**X** is not an **existential
risk** and you don\'t need to worry about it, because **A**, **B**,
**C**, **D**, and **E**]{.underline}\"; [where the failure of **any one
of propositions** A, B, C, D, or E **potentially extinguishes** the
**human species**]{.underline}. \"We don\'t need to worry about
nanotechnologic war, because a UN commission will initially develop the
technology and prevent its proliferation until such time as an active
shield is developed, capable of defending against all accidental and
malicious outbreaks that contemporary nanotechnology is capable of
producing, and this condition will persist indefinitely.\" [Vivid,
**specific scenarios** can **inflate** our probability estimates of
**security**]{.underline}, as well as misdirecting defensive investments
into needlessly narrow or implausibly detailed risk scenarios.

More generally, people tend to overestimate conjunctive probabilities
and underestimate disjunctive probabilities. (Tversky and Kahneman
1974.) That is, people tend to overestimate the probability that, e.g.,
seven events of 90% probability will all occur. Conversely, people tend
to underestimate the probability that at least one of seven events of
10% probability will occur. Someone judging whether to, e.g.,
incorporate a new startup, must evaluate the probability that many
individual events will all go right (there will be sufficient funding,
competent employees, customers will want the product) while also
considering the likelihood that at least one critical failure will occur
(the bank refuses a loan, the biggest project fails, the lead scientist
dies). This may help explain why only 44% of entrepreneurial ventures3
survive after 4 years. (Knaup 2005.)

Dawes (1988) observes: \'In their summations lawyers avoid arguing from
disjunctions (\"either this or that or the other could have occurred,
all of which would lead to the same conclusion\") in favor of
conjunctions. Rationally, of course, disjunctions are much more probable
than are conjunctions.\'

The [scenario of humanity going extinct in the next century is a
**disjunctive event**]{.underline}. It [could happen as a result of
**any** of the existential risks discussed in this book]{.underline} -
or some other cause which none of us foresaw. [Yet for a futurist,
disjunctions make for an **awkward** and **unpoetic-sounding**
prophecy]{.underline}.

7: The affect heuristic

The [**affect heuristic** refers to the way in which **subjective
impressions** of \"**goodness**\" or \"**badness**\" can act as a
heuristic, capable of producing fast **perceptual judgments**, and also
**systematic biases**]{.underline}.

In Slovic et. al. (2002), [two groups of subjects evaluated a scenario
in which an airport must decide whether to spend money to purchase new
equipment, while critics argue money should be spent on other aspects of
airport safet]{.underline}y. The response scale ranged from 0 (would not
support at all) to 20 (very strong support). A [measure that was
described as \"**Saving 150 lives**\" had **mean support of 10.4** while
a measure that was described as \"**Saving 98% of 150 lives**\" had mean
support of 13.6. Even \"Saving 85% of 150 lives\" had higher support
than simply \"Saving 150 lives]{.underline}.\" The hypothesis motivating
the experiment was that [saving 150 lives sounds **diffusely good** and
is therefore only **weakly evaluable**, while saving 98% of something is
clearly very good because it is so close to **the upper bound** on the
**percentage scale**]{.underline}.

Finucane et. al. (2000) wondered if [people conflated their assessments
of the possible benefits of a **technology** such as nuclear power, and
their assessment of possible risks, into an overall **good** or **bad
feeling** about the technology]{.underline}. Finucane et. al. tested
this hypothesis by providing four kinds of information that would
increase or decrease perceived risk or perceived benefit. There was no
logical relation between the information provided (e.g. about risks) and
the nonmanipulated variable (e.g. benefits). In each case, the
manipulated information produced an inverse effect on the affectively
inverse characteristic. Providing information that increased perception
of risk, decreased perception of benefit. Providing information that
decreased perception of benefit, increased perception of risk. Finucane
et. al. (2000) also found that time pressure greatly increased the
inverse relationship between perceived risk and perceived benefit -
presumably because time pressure increased the dominance of the affect
heuristic over analytic reasoning.

Ganzach (2001) found the same effect in the realm of finance: analysts
seemed to base their judgments of risk and return for unfamiliar stocks
upon a global affective attitude. [Stocks perceived as \"**good**\" were
judged to have **low risks** and **high return**]{.underline}; [stocks
perceived as \"bad\" were judged to have low return and high
risks]{.underline}. That is, for unfamiliar stocks, perceived risk and
perceived return were negatively correlated, as predicted by the affect
heuristic. (Note that in this experiment, sparse information played the
same role as cognitive busyness or time pressure in increasing reliance
on the affect heuristic.) For familiar stocks, perceived risk and
perceived return were positively correlated; riskier stocks were
expected to produce higher returns, as predicted by ordinary economic
theory. (If a stock is safe, buyers pay a premium for its safety and it
becomes more expensive, driving down the expected return.)

[People typically have **sparse information** in considering **future
technologies**]{.underline}. Thus it is not surprising that their
attitudes should exhibit affective polarization. When I first began to
think about such matters, I rated biotechnology as having relatively
smaller benefits compared to nanotechnology, and I worried more about an
engineered supervirus than about misuse of nanotechnology. Artificial
Intelligence, from which I expected the largest benefits of all, gave me
not the least anxiety. [Later, after working through the problems in
much greater detail, my assessment of relative benefit remained much the
same, but my worries had inverted: the more powerful technologies, with
greater anticipated benefit]{.underline}s, now appeared to have
correspondingly more difficult risks. In retrospect this is what one
would expect. [But **analysts** with **scanty information** may rate
technologies **affectively**, so that information about **perceived
benefit** seems to **mitigate** the force of **perceived
risk**]{.underline}.

#### 5. Scope neglect.

**Yudkowsky '06** \[Eliezer; August 31; American writer and researcher
in artificial intelligence (AI) who advocates for Friendly AI (FAI) and
the Singularity; UC Berkeley Statistics Department, "Cognitive biases

accessed: 7.22.25\]

[**Scope neglect** has been shown to apply to **human
lives**]{.underline}. Carson and Mitchell (1995) report that increasing
the [alleged risk associated with **chlorinated drinking** water from
0.004 to 2.43 annual **deaths** per 1,000 (a factor of **600**)
increased SWTP from \$3.78 to \$15.23 (a factor of **4**]{.underline}).
Baron and Greene (1996) found [**no effect** from varying lives saved by
a factor of **ten**]{.underline}.

Fetherstonhaugh et. al. (1997), in a paper entitled \"Insensitivity to
the Value of Human Life: A Study of Psychophysical Numbing\", found
evidence that our perception of human deaths, and valuation of human
lives, obeys Weber\'s Law - meaning that we use a logarithmic scale. And
indeed, studies of scope neglect in which the quantitative variations
are huge enough to elicit any sensitivity at all, show small linear
increases in Willingness-To-Pay corresponding to exponential increases
in scope. Kahneman et. al. (1999) interpret this as an additive effect
of scope affect and prototype affect - the prototype image elicits most
of the emotion, and the scope elicits a smaller amount of emotion which
is added (not multiplied) with the first amount.

Albert Szent-Györgyi said: \"[I am deeply moved if I see **one man
suffering** and would **risk my life** for him]{.underline}. Then [I
talk impersonally about the possible **pulverization** of our big
cities, with a hundred million dead]{.underline}. I am [unable to
multiply **one man\'s suffering** by a **hundred**
million]{.underline}.\" Human emotions take place within an analog
brain. The [human brain cannot release enough **neurotransmitters** to
feel emotion a **thousand times** as strong as the grief of one
**funeral**]{.underline}. A prospective risk going from 10,000,000
deaths to 100,000,000 deaths does not multiply by ten the strength of
our determination to stop it. [It adds one more **zero** on paper for
our eyes to glaze over, an effect so small that one must usually **jump
several orders** of magnitude to **detect** the **difference
experimentally**]{.underline}.

#### Deontology fails.

[Deontologists hold that there is a constraint against
killing]{.underline}: [that it's wrong to kill an **innocent person**
even if this would save **five other innocent people** from being
killed]{.underline}. This verdict can seem puzzling on its face. 21

After all, [given how **terrible killing** is]{.underline}, [should we
not want there to be **less** of it]{.underline}? [Rational choice in
general tends to be **goal-directed**]{.underline}, [a conception which
fits poorly with **deontic** **constraints**]{.underline}. 22

[A deontologist might claim that their goal is simply to avoid violating
**moral constraints** themselves]{.underline}, which they can best
achieve by not killing anyone, even if that results in more individuals
being killed. While this explanation can render deontological verdicts
coherent, [it does so at the cost of making them seem awfully
**narcissistic**, as though the deontologist's central concern was just
to maintain their **own moral purity**]{.underline} or "clean hands".

Deontologists might push back against this characterization by instead
insisting that moral action need not be goal-directed at all. 23

Rather than only seeking to promote value (or minimize harm[), they
claim that moral agents may sometimes be called upon to respect
**another's value**]{.underline} (by not harming them, even as a means
to preventing greater harm to others), [which would seem an
appropriately **outwardly-directed**, non-narcissistic
motivation]{.underline}.

[The challenge remains that such a proposal makes moral norms
**puzzlingly divergent** from other kinds of **practical
norms**]{.underline}. If [morality sometimes calls for **respecting
value** rather than **promoting it**]{.underline}, [why is the same not
true of **prudence**]{.underline}? (Given that pain is bad for you, for
example, it would not seem prudent to refuse a painful operation now if
the refusal commits you to five comparably painful operations in
future.) Deontologists may offer various answers to this [question, but
insofar as we are inclined to think, pre-theoretically, that ethics
ought to be continuous with other forms of **rational
choice**]{.underline}, [that gives us some reason to prefer
**consequentialist accounts**]{.underline}.

[Deontologists also face a tricky question about where to **draw** the
**line**]{.underline}. [Is it at least okay to kill one person to
prevent a **hundred killings**]{.underline}? Or a million? [Absolutists
never permit killing, no **matter** the **stakes**]{.underline}. But
such a view seems too extreme for many. [Moderate deontologists allow
that sufficiently high stakes can **justify violations**]{.underline}.
But how high? Any answer they offer is apt to seem arbitrary and
unprincipled. [Between the principled options of consequentialism or
absolutism, many will find **consequentialism** to be the **more
plausible** of the two]{.underline}.

Like two giant boxers exchanging punches, but neither landing the
knock¬out blow, Kantians and Hegelians seem to be in a stand-off on what
(in contemporary parlance) is known as the "Empty Formalism Objection."
[Kant's ethics is charged with being merely formal and thereby failing
to provide the kind of specific guidance that any defensible ethical
system should have the **resources** to **provide**]{.underline}. Hegel
is often credited with having formulated this objection in its most
incisive way, and a wealth of Kantian responses have been deployed to
answer it. In this paper, I take up the objection as it appears in §135R
of Elements of the Philosophy of Right in order to scrutinize the
contemporary debate between the two camps. I propose that there are, in
fact, three different, albeit connected objections and examine (what I
take to be) the best Kantian replies to them. I will neither adjudicate
which ofthese replies is the most accurate interpretation of Kant's
texts, nor trace the particular historical context in which Hegel takes
up Kant's ethics, nor the way the empty formalism objection fits into
Hegel's wider system. This is partly because of constraints of space,
and partly because many of the contemporary Kantian replies - for better
or for worse - treat the empty formalism objection as a self-standing
philosophical problem, irrespective of its historical context or
systematic place in Hegel's theory. My limited aim here is to show that,
even if one grants - for argument's sake - the legitimacy of such a
non-contextual approach, significant difficulties remain.

1 Empty Formalism in the Philosophy of Right

What we now call the empty formalism objection finds, perhaps, its most
pithy statement in Hegel's Philosophy of Right, about midway through the
discussion of "Moralitat" (third section, "The Good and Conscience"). I
will concentrate here on this statement, drawing on the rest of the book
and Hegel's other works only when necessary.

Still, [some minimal textual contextualization of the **empty formalism
objection** within the Philosophy of Right is in order]{.underline}.
Hegel's argument is at a point where it has been suggested that the good
provides an objective standard by which the will should be guided (see
§133). [Specifically, the will faces the good as an obligation or
**duty**]{.underline} (Pflicht) [which we are meant to obey for its own
sake,]{.underline} since the good here is contrasted to all specific
determina¬tions of the will that have proved unsuitable guides for
genuinely free willing in the preceding discussion and, hence, what
remains is only the general abstract essence of goodness that we ought
to respect as such. The question then becomes what this means concretely
for our conduct (see §134). The [problem which arises is that for any
conduct we require specific guidance in form of **detailed content** and
ends to **orientate** our **wills**]{.underline}, but [such specific
guidance is not contained in, and presumably can also not be derived
from, the mere idea of duty for **duty's sake**]{.underline} (see §135).
It is not that we have no idea what this content or these ends could
be - presumably drawing on the earlier discussion of abstract right and
welfare, Hegel suggests that we should do what is right and work for the
happiness of ourselves and others (see § 134). Rather, the point is that
[even such abstract and general guidance as this cannot be derived and
is not **contained** in the idea of **duty** for **duty's**
sake]{.underline}. Hence, this idea lacks any content and consists
merely in an empty identity, [forcing people to turn to their conscience
for any **specific guidance**]{.underline}, which, however, has pitfalls
of its own (which Hegel then goes on to discuss; see §§136-140; see also
§141).

It is in this context that Hegel, in the remark to § 135, turns to his
critique of Kant's moral philosophy. He begins the remark with praising
Kant: specif¬ically, he credits him with having introduced the idea of
autonomy, that is, the idea that morality requires the ability not just
to reflect on and choose among one's impulses, inclinations, and desires
(what Kant calls "negative free¬dom"), but also the ability to be
motivated by pure practical reason alone - in short, to act on the
requirements of reason for the sake of these requirements alone and
thereby to achieve unconditional self-determination in one's willing.
This praise is followed by what we now call the empty formalism
objection. [Kant is faulted for turning his important insight into a
one-sided position, absolutizing the moral **standpoint**]{.underline}.
Doing so lands one with empty formalism for the following reasons:

[From this point of view, no **immanent** **doctrine** of
duties]{.underline} \[Pflichtenlehre\] [is **possible**]{.underline}.
One might indeed bring in material from outside and thereby arrive at
particular duties, [but it is impossible to make the transition to the
determination of **particular duties** from the above **determination**
of duty as **absence** of **contradiction**]{.underline}, as formal
correspondence with itself, [which is no different from the
specification of **abstract indeterminacy**]{.underline}; and even if
such a particular content for action is taken into consideration, there
is no criterion within the principle for deciding whether or not this
content is a duty. On the contrary, [it is possible to justify any
**wrong** or **immoral mode** of action by this
**means**]{.underline}. - Kant's further form - the capacity of an
action to be envisaged as universal maxim - does yield a more concrete
representation \[Vorstellung\] of the situation in question, but it does
not in itself \[fur sich\] contain any principle apart from formal
identity and that absence of contradiction already referred to. - [The
fact that no **property** is present is in itself no more
**contradictory** than is the non-existence of this or that **individual
people**]{.underline}, family, etc., or the complete absence of human
life. [But if it is already established and presupposed that property
and human life should **exist** and be **respected**]{.underline}, [then
it is a contradiction to commit **theft** or
**murder**]{.underline};\... But [if a duty is to be willed merely as a
duty and not because of its **content**, it is a formal identity which
necessarily excludes every **content** and
**determination**]{.underline}. (PR §135R; emphasis original;
translation altered)

This passage contains a whole barrage of criticisms. While I will return
to some of the more specific points later, it is useful here to distill
the main elements of this passage, and I propose that it boils down to
three general claims: 

1\. [No immanent **doctrine** of **duties**]{.underline}: [it is not
possible to arrive at a doctrine of duties on the basis of the mere idea
of duty for duty\'s sake or the formal identity of rational willing
proposed in the **categorical imperative**]{.underline}.

2\. [No criterion for testing **potential duties**]{.underline}: [even
if candidate duties are provided from the **outside**]{.underline},
[testing for whether there is consistency in **rational
willing**]{.underline} (or for whether they can be willed as a universal
law) [does not provide a criterion for determining whether or not the
candidate duties are **genuine duties**]{.underline}.

3\. [False positives]{.underline}: [**immoral** acts could successfully
pass the test for con¬sistency in rational willing and the **maxims**
**involved** could be **universalized**]{.underline}.2

These three criticisms are interconnected. For example, criticism 3 is a
way of amplifying criticism 2: testing [for consistency of rational
willing is not just **useless**]{.underline} (as criticism 2 has it),
[but even **dangerous**]{.underline}.3 Also, as the discussion of these
three criticisms will show, they form a kind of dialectic, with one
leading to the other by way of Kantian replies.

The criticisms are meant to be immanent ones - [Hegel is trying to show
how the **Kantian position** is problematic on its own terms and
**implodes**]{.underline}, when fully thought through (albeit it can
also be rescued to some extent by being sublated in Hegel's own
position). Hence, Kantians will have to recognize themselves in the
characterization offered. While I will suggest later that Hegel might
well be accused of presenting an incomplete picture, the basic
characterization that has gone into the three criticisms above seems
correct. Specifically, Kantians would have a hard time denying that the
moral law, as **[Kant]{.underline}** thinks of it, [consists in a merely
**formal requirement** of **reason**]{.underline}. [It is crucial to
**Kant's argument** that]{.underline}, if there can be a moral law at
all, [it has to exclude all **empirical ends** and cannot be
a]{.underline} "**[material principle]{.underline}**," since [neither
such ends, nor material principles have the required universality and
necessity for **lawfulness**]{.underline} (G 4: 399-402, 419-421; KpV
esp. 5: 21-28). Hence, if there can be a moral law at all, then it must
be formal in the sense of neither relying on empirical ends nor being a
material principle[. As such, it can only consist in the very idea of
**lawfulness itself**]{.underline} - that is, in demanding that rational
willing is consistent with itself and that one's subjective principle of
action (one's maxim) can be willed to be a universal law. In short,
Hegel latches onto the key move in Kant's argument for the categorical
imperative, specif¬ically the formula of universal law.4 Moreover,
Kantians would also accept that all human action requires specific ends
and guidance. Kant repeatedly admits that all actions are directed at
ends (G 4: 427; MS 6: 384-385; see also KpV 5: 34) and our (lower-level)
maxims involve specific content and specific ends, or at least specific
action types done for specific types of ends (such as making false
promises as a way to promote one's interests, or committing suicide when
one expects more suffering than happiness from living on). Hence, the
problem of empty formalism cannot be simply sidestepped by denying the
background assumptions leading to it.

\*\* FUL = Formula Of Universal Law

[Hegel critiques the CI for not being able to give]{.underline}
\"[**any** **content** to **morality**]{.underline}\" [since it **solely
relies** on the form of a maxim to provide an **ethical
judgment**]{.underline}. For example, in the deposit case, [when
stealing is universalized it leads to a **contradiction**,]{.underline}
and the person who gets robbed is treated as a means. [Thus the CI
determines that stealing is immoral regardless of the
**situation**]{.underline}. Following the logic of the CI, someone who
steals is simply a \"thief\", the same way a \"murderer\" is simply a
murderer in Hegel\'s example and the act they committed is unethical
regardless of their particular situation or history. In this view, [the
particular is absorbed under a priori concepts and the form **precedes
content**]{.underline} [in order to establish an **abstract moral
judgment**]{.underline}. On the contrary, for the murderer example,
Hegel argues that one finds the ethical truth regarding this man\'s case
not simply in the maxim he acted on but rather \"in his history.\" This
disregard of actualized content by the CI when reaching an ethical
judgment regarding a situation is the \"empty formalism\" critique that
Hegel raises against Kant. [The CI\'s inability to give any content to
morality is further displayed in worldly examples Hegel/Hegelians came
up with where the FUL is conditioned to require **further
content**]{.underline} [to have any **normative**
**legitimacy**]{.underline}. In these examples, [the FUL either delivers
a **confusing conclusion** or an **ethically mistaken** result due to
its insensitivity to the particularity of situations that are present in
**worldly experience**]{.underline}.

Firstly, Hegel critiques Kant's own 'deposit example' to show that the
FUL is empty. In this case, the [FUL is useless because]{.underline}
\"[it cannot determine whether or not **property** or a **social
system** without property is a **morally good thing**]{.underline}.\" In
a world where property is necessarily established as an ethical content,
the FUL would indeed prohibit theft since when stealing is
universalized, property loses its place as a necessary content, causing
a contradiction. However, [the FUL does not say anything
about]{.underline} \"[whether it is right or wrong for people to possess
**private property**]{.underline}\" in the first place, hence [it is
restricted when it comes to making a complex **concrete** **ethical
judgment**]{.underline}. Hegel stresses the fact that [to demonstrate
the **inconsistency** or **immorality** of a maxim of this
**nature**]{.underline}, \"one [would have to admit that a particular
**content** like **property** has taken on]{.underline}, contingently[,
a necessary and **universal legitimacy** such as to make its **negation
contradictory**]{.underline}.\" [By disregarding an **action\'s
content**]{.underline} (what it presupposes to be necessary, contingent,
etc.) and only focusing on the maxim\'s form, [the CI delivers abstract
and superficial results that neglect the actual **ethical truth** of a
**situation**]{.underline}. For instance, [the CI can lead one to think
that it is unethical for a starving kid to **steal bread** because if
theft is **universalized** this leads to a
**contradiction**]{.underline}. However, this [judgment would not
consider the possible **unethical distribution** of property or the
ethical validity of **property existing** in the first
place]{.underline}. [This is because the CI only takes an agent\'s
**maxim\'s form** into account]{.underline}, and their particularity is
disregarded, since if their particularity is taken into consideration
the CI is unable to attain its goal to be a universal practical
philosophy. Hegel thinks that the CI disregards the concrete content
that is present in all particular situations, which is also required to
make a non-abstract ethical judgment of a situation. [There can be no
single abstract \'supreme **principle** of **morality\'** because a
moral judgment demands **particular content** and the method of
**judgment** is formed through its **synthesis** with the **concrete
content**]{.underline}.

#### 3. [FALSE POSITIVES]{.underline}\-\--logical consistency [cannot]{.underline} cast [moral judgement]{.underline}.

https://philpapers.org/rec/BARTPO-171; Accessed 7.22.25\]

\*\* FUL = Formula Of Universal Law

The second problem of the FUL is [that it falsely detects contradictions
in some moral acts that are widely considered **reasonably
ethical**]{.underline}. [Hegel gives the example]{.underline}:
"**[succor the poor]{.underline}**", [which when universalized leaves
**nobody poor**]{.underline} (i.e., no poor person to succor), [thus the
maxim]{.underline} "**[succor the poor\'\']{.underline}** [becomes
**impossible** to act on]{.underline}. [Therefore the CI]{.underline}
would have to conclude that \"succor the poor\" is an unethical maxim
through the use of so-called \"reason\", [even though it does not
sufficiently explain why **helping** the **poor** is considered
**unethical**]{.underline}, [other than it being a \"**contradictory**\"
**maxim**]{.underline}.

[Empiricists, and some rationalists, attack the Innate Knowledge thesis
in **two main ways**. First, they offer accounts of how sense
**experience** or **intuition** and deduction provide the knowledge that
is claimed to be **innate**]{.underline}. Second, they [directly
criticize the Innate Knowledge thesis **itself**]{.underline}. The
classic statement of this second line of attack is presented in Locke's
Essay. Locke raises the issue of just what innate knowledge is.
[Particular instances of knowledge are supposed to be in our minds as
part of our **rational make-up**]{.underline}, [but how are they "in
**our minds**]{.underline}"? [If the implication is that we **all
consciously** have this **knowledge**, it **is plainly
false**]{.underline}. Propositions often given as examples of innate
knowledge, even such plausible candidates as the principle that the same
thing cannot both be and not be, are not consciously accepted by
children and those with severe cognitive limitations. If the point of
calling such principles "innate" is not to imply that they are or have
been consciously accepted by all rational beings, then it is hard to see
what the point is. "No proposition can be said to be in the mind, which
it never yet knew, which it never yet was conscious of" (Essay, 1.2.5).
Proponents of innate knowledge might respond that some knowledge is
innate in that we have the capacity to have it. That claim, while true,
is of little interest, however. "If [the capacity of **knowing**, be the
**natural impression** contended for, all the truths a man ever comes to
know, will, by this account, be **every one of them**, **innate**; and
this great point will amount to **no more**, but only an **improper**
way of speaking; which whilst it pretends to assert the contrary, says
nothing different from those, who **deny innate
principles**]{.underline}. For nobody, I think, ever denied, that the
mind was capable of knowing several truths" (Essay, 1.2.5). Locke thus
challenges defenders of the Innate Knowledge thesis to present an
account of innate knowledge that allows their position to be both true
and interesting. [A narrow interpretation of innateness faces
counterexamples of **rational individuals** who do not meet its
**conditions**]{.underline}. A generous interpretation implies that all
our knowledge, even that clearly provided by experience, is innate.

Defenders of innate knowledge take up Locke's challenge. Leibniz
responds in New Essays by appealing to an account of innateness in terms
of natural potential to avoid Locke's dilemma. Consider Peter
Carruthers' similar reply.

We have noted that while one form of nativism claims (somewhat
implausibly) that knowledge is innate in the sense of being present as
such (or at least in propositional form) from birth, it might also be
maintained that knowledge is innate in the sense of being innately
determined to make its appearance at some stage in childhood. This
latter thesis is surely the most plausible version of nativism. (1992,
p. 51)

Carruthers claims that our innate knowledge is determined through
evolutionary selection (p. 111). Evolution has resulted in our being
determined to know certain things (e.g. principles of folk-psychology)
at particular stages of our life, as part of our natural development.
Experiences provide the occasion for our consciously believing the known
propositions but not the basis for our knowledge of them (p. 52).
Carruthers thus has a ready reply to Locke's counterexamples of children
and cognitively limited persons who do not believe propositions claimed
to be instances of innate knowledge. The former have not yet reached the
proper stage of development; the latter are persons in whom natural
development has broken down (pp. 49--50).

A serious problem for the Innate Knowledge thesis remains, however. We
[**know** a **proposition** only if it is **true**]{.underline}, [we
**believe** it and our **belief** is **warranted**]{.underline}.
[Rationalists who assert the existence of **innate knowledge** are not
just claiming that, as a matter of **human evolution**]{.underline},
God's design or some other factor, at a particular point in our
development, [certain sorts of experiences trigger our **belief** in
**particular propositions** in a way that does not involve our learning
them from the experiences]{.underline}. [Their claim is **even
bolder**]{.underline}: In at least some of these cases, [our
empirical**ly triggered**, but not **empirically
warranted**]{.underline}, [belief is nonetheless **warranted** and so
**known**]{.underline}. [How can these beliefs be **warranted** if they
do not gain their **warrant** from the **experiences** that cause us to
have them or from **intuition** and **deduction**]{.underline}?

[Intuition and deduction can provide us with knowledge of necessary
truths such as those found in **mathematics** and
**logic**]{.underline}, but [**such knowledge** is **not substantive**
knowledge of the **external** **world**]{.underline}. It is only
knowledge of the relations of our own ideas. If the rationalist shifts
the argument so it appeals to knowledge in morals, Hume's reply is to
offer an analysis of our moral concepts by which such knowledge is
empirically gained knowledge of matters of fact.

[Morals and criticism are not so **properly objects** of the
**understanding** as of **taste** and **sentiment**]{.underline}.
Beauty, whether moral or natural, is felt more properly than perceived.
Or if we reason concerning it and endeavor to fix the standard, we
regard a new fact, to wit, the general taste of mankind, or some other
fact which may be the object of reasoning and inquiry. (Enquiry, 12.3,
p. 122)

[If the rationalist appeals to our knowledge in **metaphysics** to
support the **argument**]{.underline}, Hume denies that we have such
knowledge.

[If we take in our hand any volume]{.underline}\--of divinity or school
metaphysics, for instance\--let us ask, [Does it contain any **abstract

**[No]{.underline}**. [Does it contain any **experimental reasoning**

Commit it then to the flames, for it can contain nothing but
**sophistry** and **illusion**]{.underline}. (Enquiry, 12.3, p. 123)

An updated version of this general empiricist reply, with an increased
emphasis on language and the nature of meaning, is given in the
twentieth-century by A. J. Ayer's version of logical positivism.
[Adopting **positivism's verification theory** of meaning, Ayer assigns
every **cognitively meaningful sentence** to one of two categories:
either it is a **tautology**]{.underline}, and so true solely by virtue
of the meaning of its terms and provides no substantive information
about the world, [or it is open to **empirical
verification**]{.underline}. [There is, then, no room for **knowledge**
about the external world by **intuition** or **deduction**]{.underline}.

[There can be no **a priori knowledge** of reality]{.underline}. For ...
the truths of pure reason, [the propositions which we know to be valid
**independently** of all **experience**]{.underline}, [are so only in
virtue of their lack of **factual content**]{.underline} ... \[By
contrast\] [empirical propositions are one and all hypotheses which may
be **confirmed** or **discredited** in **actual sense
experience**]{.underline}. (Ayer 1952, pp. 86; 93--94)

[The rationalists' argument for the Intuition/Deduction thesis **goes
wrong** at the start]{.underline}, according to empiricists, [by
assuming that we can have substantive knowledge of the external world
that outstrips what **experience** can **warrant**]{.underline}. We
cannot.

The Utilitarian Response

Utilitarians begin their reply to this sort of attack by arguing that
their theory does not mandate the conduct the critic says it does. They
challenge the facts imagined in these cases, arguing [that it is
preposterous to suppose that killing or torturing an innocent person,
for example, could possibly be the single most effective thing one could
do to promote long-term social well-being]{.underline}. Is there really
absolutely nothing else the agent could do that would have better
results? [The more dreadful the action or policy the critic envisions,
the less believable it becomes that carrying it out would bring about
more good than anything else one could do.]{.underline} Consider the
allegation that a slave system might somehow maximize collective welfare
and that therefore utilitarians would be obliged, wrongly, to support
it. Given all that we know about human history, psychology, and social
dynamics, CONTEMPORARY CRITICISMS 205 [how could it possibly promote
"utility in the largest sense, grounded in the permanent interests of
man as a progressive being"]{.underline} (Mill 1978: 10) for society to
adopt slavery? Slaves inevitably suffer from their lot and chafe against
their chains, and they can be terrorized by the threat of future
punishment in a way that no animal can. Moreover, even otherwise decent
people tend to exploit those over whom they have absolute power. [If we
keep in mind real people and the ways in which the world really works,
**it becomes utterly fantastic to suppose that slavery might promote the
long-term collective well-being of humanity better than any alternative
way of organizing society**.]{.underline}

Assume, however, that the critic refuses to allow the utilitarian to
challenge the hypothesized facts of the example. He or she simply
insists that the facts are as stipulated and that somehow or other
conduct or policies we normally consider morally repugnant really would
maximize total welfare. In response, of course, utilitarians must
acknowledge that their principle entails that it is right to perform
that action, whatever it is, that produces the most good overall. But
they deny that the imagined conflict with ordinary morality provides a
compelling reason for rejecting utilitarianism.

[Suppose, first, that in order to offer a plausible scenario, the critic
asks us to imagine that it would maximize welfare to perform an action
that, although normally considered wrongful, is not absolutely horrific:
lying to an acquaintance, perhaps, or breaking a casual promise, or
hurting a small child. In these cases, the utilitarian will point out
that, assuming the stakes are high enough -- perhaps twisting the arm of
a hysterical young girl is really the only way to make her quickly tell
us where a terrorist, whom she has mistakenly befriended, is hiding --
then it's doubtful that ordinary, commonsense morality would condemn the
action.]{.underline} **[Everyday morality is not
absolutist]{.underline}**; it recognizes that unusual circumstances can
sometimes justify breaking the ordinary moral rules, that in rare cases
it really can be right, all things considered, to tell a lie, break a
promise, or cause an innocent person pain.

To this, however, the critic is likely to respond that although
commonsense morality permits us to override its rules when the benefits
of doing so are great, it does not license us merely to obtain only a
small increase in overall welfare -- 1001 units of benefit from breaking
a promise, say, as opposed to 1000 units from keeping it. (Ross 1930:
35; Hooker 2000: 145--6). It's doubtful, of course, that one can give
meaningful content to the hypothesis that breaking a promise produces
one-tenth of a percent more good than keeping it, and even if the
goodness of states of affairs could be ranked as exactly as this, no one
could claim to know these rankings with the imagined degree of
precision. [Nevertheless, suppose that in the long run and all things
considered (including the effect on one's reputation, the willingness of
others to trust one, and potential damage to the general practice of
promising) slightly more good would come from breaking a promise than
from keeping it and that the agent knows this for a fact. The critics
believe that this conflicts with our ordinary moral ideas, but when one
colors in some]{.underline} 206 WILLIAM H. SHAW [realistic details --
skipping my promised lunch with Gretchen when my day is extremely busy
and I have arranged for her best friend Alice to show up at the
restaurant in my stead -- then it is far from clear that breaking the
promise would be so patently immoral that any moral theory that permits
or requires it must forfeit one's allegiance]{.underline}. Moreover,
utilitarians will argue that **[there is nothing sacrosanct about
ordinary morality]{.underline}**. If its rules sometimes conflict with
utilitarianism, then we should adjust our ordinary moral thinking or at
least have a greater appreciation of the limits of its applicability.

To be sure, [if the imagined welfare-maximizing action is truly horrific
or unconscionable (torturing an innocent person, for example), then it
becomes harder to dismiss our ordinary moral instincts]{.underline},
which rebel against such conduct. Where the stakes are high, however,
ordinary morality itself may be stumped. Is it right or wrong to torture
to death an innocent person if doing so will somehow stop a war in which
tens of thousands will otherwise die? Questions like this are not ones
that the rules of everyday morality were designed to answer. But if the
welfare benefit of the awful conduct is only marginal -- killing a
healthy hospital patient in order to use her organs to save the lives of
three others -- then doing so would undoubtedly contradict everyday
moral thinking.

Here, though, utilitarianism can endorse our ordinary moral sentiments
without abandoning its own standard of right. In other words,
utilitarians can maintain that it's a good thing that doctors refuse to
even entertain the idea of killing healthy patients, that Michael
opposes slavery categorically and across the board, and that Rebecca
would never, ever, conspire to frame someone for a crime he didn't
commit, no matter how much benefit was alleged to flow from doing so.
The reason is simple. Although it is possible that performing some
ghastly deed might be the best course of conduct in a far-fetched set of
circumstances imagined by the critic of utilitarianism, these are not
circumstances real people will ever encounter. [In the world **as it
actually is, we do much better if people are dead set against doing
atrocious things**, if they instinctively reject the possibility that
supporting slavery, framing an innocent person, killing a healthy
patient for his organs, torturing a child, and so on, might be the right
course of action.]{.underline} People who feel and act this way will, of
course, do the non-utilitarian thing in the fanciful circumstances
imagined by the critic of utilitarianism. But they will act the right
way in the world they actually live in, a world in which such dreadful
actions diminish net happiness. Indeed, the more strongly and
categorically people oppose such conduct, the more likely they are to
behave, in the real world, in happinesspromoting ways.

[An example: the wrongfulness of killing]{.underline}

F[rom a utilitarian perspective, the negative consequences of
intentional homicide are obvious.]{.underline} In addition to whatever
pain the victim suffers, killing the person deprives him of future
well-being, and it typically brings sorrow and grief to family
CONTEMPORARY CRITICISMS 207 and friends[. Moreover, fear of being
murdered can quickly and easily spread worry and insecurity throughout
society.]{.underline} All societies firmly prohibit killing other
people, at least under ordinary circumstances, and there is a fully
compelling utilitarian case for their doing so. [Without such a
**prohibition**, **social existence would barely be
possible**.]{.underline}

Now consider again the case of the old tramp, whose murder would,
according to the critic of utilitarianism, optimally promote net
well-being. Even if the supposed facts are exactly as the critic
imagines -- and that's a very big if -- one is unlikely to know, or have
compelling grounds for believing, that this is so, all things considered
and in the long run. Furthermore, teaching people that it is permissible
to kill others whenever they are firmly convinced that doing so is for
the best would have disastrous social consequences. "**[If it were
thought allowable for any one to put to death at pleasure any human
being whom he believes that the world would be well rid of," Mill
writes, then "nobody's life would be safe]{.underline}**" (1852: 182).
Moreover, a readiness to kill other people, even in the cause of
promoting the good of all, represents a disposition that utilitarians
would strive hard to discourage in favor of attitudes and sentiments
(like a respect for life) that tend to promote welfare. Real
utilitarians cannot love and assist others as they should and yet be as
ready to kill people as the unhappy tramp case imagine.

### Morality\-\--1NC

**Utilitarianism is uniquely capable of defining what morality is --
their judgement mechanism can't grapple this.**

**Sola '23** (Andrew Sola: earned his Ph.D. from the University of East
Anglia in Norwich, England. From 2004 to 2018, he was Professor of
Philosophy and English at the University of Maryland Global Campus,

Greater Good" Springer Nature Link)//GOATKUNA

Perhaps [**the strongest argument in favor of the utilitarian way of
thinking** is that, unlike other systems of ethics, it answers an
important question which other theo- ries either fail to address or only
address obliquely: What is the telos of morality?]{.underline} (Telos is
an ancient Greek word that means the aim, final goal, or ultimate
purpose of something.)

For example, [religious people might believe that the point of morality
is to go to Heaven or to follow God's commands. Kantians believe that
the point of morality is to behave according to the inviolable laws of
reason. Cultural relativists believe that there is no point to morality
at all because morality is simply a descriptive term that means behaving
according to the traditions of one's culture. Ethical egoists believe
that the point of morality is to follow one's self-interest and to live
one's own life to the fullest (even at the expense of other people's
happiness). Social contract theorists believe that the point is to live
according to the rules that will guarantee the frictionless running of a
civilized society. However, **only the utilitarian thinkers say
explicitly what the goal of all this discussion about morality really
should be:** more happiness and less suffering---]{.underline}on this
planet, in the present and in the future, for as many creatures as
possible.

Their point is a good one: [Why do we have moral rules if not to ensure
the great- est possible happiness and the least amount of suffering for
as many creatures as possible? Why are religious people focusing on
being happy in Heaven when life on earth is miserable? Why does Kant
focus on following absolute moral rules when doing so often leads to
pain? In short, utilitarians believe that the **real and ever- present
happiness and suffering of humans and non-human animals living now on
this planet is much more important for ethical decision-making** than
any other consideration.]{.underline}

We have seen that utilitarianism anchors morality in a universal sense
of moral good---more happiness, less suffering. What could possibly be
wrong about such an idea? Let's examine this uncomfortable topic by
calculating the monetary value of your own precious life.

### Egalitarianism\-\--1NC

**Utilitarianism leads to the best outcomes in saving lives**

Principal of the firm, Health Strategies International, James G. Kahn,
Professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco,

cost-effectiveness analysis in resource allocation for global health",
*The Journal of Philosophy, Ethics, and Humanities in Medicine,*
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6446322/ //GBH

The possibility of [repugnant outcomes is by no means unique to
utilitarianism]{.underline}. As shown in the Trolley Problem, and in
evaluating the ethical implications of favoring expenditures on
antiretroviral drugs for treatment over pre-exposure prophylaxis,
[non-efficiency based principles are often hard to interpret,
irrelevant, or contradictory.]{.underline} They may also lead to
outcomes that diverge dramatically from that of health-maximization.
[**Cost-effectiveness** analysis has the virtue of being **relevant to
any resource allocation decision**]{.underline}. Its operational
definition is unambiguous (maximization of health benefits for a given
budget) even if performing cost-effectiveness calculations is sometimes
challenging.

Other principles, such as rule of rescue or the urgent need based
adjudications of claims on health care resources, have expression in
clinical medicine and elsewhere. [However, the principles appropriate
when considering the welfare of large populations differs from those
appropriate for clinical medicine or for small communities and families.
**Utilitarianism,** because it does not distinguish between identified
and statistical lives **is**, in general, the framework **best suited to
the former**.]{.underline}

We do not propose that utilitarianism is the only legitimate guide to
global health resource allocation decisions. However, we do suggest that
it should be the point of departure for further analysis. Because of its
intrinsic ethical dimensions, efficiency is not merely one criterion
among many. The promotion of human flourishing is a central goal of most
ethical system. Attaining the greatest population health available with
given resources is consonant with that flourishing. Thus, decisions to
diverge from pursuit of that goal to promote other ethical values should
be acknowledged and justified.

Wherever possible, [**decision-makers should quantify** the tradeoff,
i.e. the loss of health resulting from pursuit of **other ethical
values**]{.underline}. This will often be possible in a rough but
serviceable manner. For example, spending incremental dollars on the
male condom will almost always generate greater health benefit than
spending the same money on female condoms \[29\]. The details of why
this is true in almost every HIV epidemic type and risk sub-population
are complex, but this finding was driven primarily by two factors: a)
the female condom is much more expensive than the male condom while
conferring the same protective benefit per unprotected sex episode; and
b) use of a female condom often displaces use of a male condom, thus
providing no additional protection. However, one of the virtues of the
female condom according to proponents, is that it enhances women's
autonomy in negotiating the terms of sexual relations, and thus
contributes to the empowerment and rights of women \[30, 31\]. Though
potentially significant, the degree to which access to the female condom
helps secure this right to autonomy is hard to quantify. Rather than
either ignoring right-based imperatives on the one hand, or insisting
that these values trump "mere" efficiency concerns on the other hand, we
performed an analysis which solved for the value that would need to be
placed on the incremental empowerment of women, such that investments in
the female condom over the male condom would be justified. Table 1
illustrates the health consequences of promoting the female condom over
the male condom in high-prevalence HIV countries. The figures are the
results of a cost-effectiveness model that assumes the full costs of
\$0.13 for the male condom and \$1.00 for the female condom. This is a
low estimate of the cost of the female condom and the results displayed
are therefore likely tilted in favor of the female condom. The model
incorporates information on HIV transmission risk per episode;
protective benefits of both types of condoms; sexual behavioral data on
three sub-populations, sex workers, women with regular partners and
women with casual partners; rates of substitution between male and
female condoms; and other parameters affecting the cost of generating an
incremental protected sexual episode.

[The key finding is that for every \$100,000 spent on condoms in an
African country with high HIV prevalence, between 92 and 118 additional
cases of HIV could be averted by investing in the male condom rather
than the female condom. If one believes in the power of the female
condom to enhance women's rights, **one might want to argue that this is
a price worth paying**]{.underline}. It would be an example of what
Johri terms "the opportunity cost of equity" \[15\]. However, in the
context of the female condom it seems a difficult case to make,
particularly if one is concerned about the rights and health, of those
92--118 additionally infected people, many of whom will be women.
Article 25 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights
guarantees access to adequate medical care for all persons \[32\].
Similar language exists in Articles 12 and14 of the Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, and Article 12
of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
\[33, 34\]. [These legal and moral principles are not superseded by
utilitarian values. But the full realization of these rights-based
values will, for the foreseeable future be imperfect given health care
budgets and other constraints. Therefore, efficiency **concerns as
expressed in utilitarianism and cost-effectiveness analysis will often
be the best guide to rapidly securing those rights for as many people as
possible.**]{.underline} However, this can only be accomplished when
decision makers acknowledge that the trade-offs of the type illustrated
in the female condom example are real and consequential.

When competing ethical principles favor different actions, [following
**non-efficiency based principles may increase mortality or
morbidity.**]{.underline} It is true that a small fraction of what the
world spends on armaments and on ultra-luxurious or frivolous pursuits
could, if re-deployed, have huge global health benefits. But this
information is of no use to the Minister of Health in a low-income
country as she decides what portion of her budget should be allocated to
TB drugs, versus bed nets to control malaria.

other theories**

8\. Conclusion

To show that utilitarianism is not a form of egalitarianism, [one would
have to find criteria for a theory to be a form of egalitarianism that
utilitarianism fails to meet.]{.underline} Here is a review of possible
such criteria, and a summary of this paper's arguments with respect to
them.

a\. [**Egalitarian theories favour** more **equal distributions of
well-being**]{.underline}. This is true of some egalitarian theories,
but as a necessary condition for a theory's being egalitarian it is
flawed: it does not capture our intuitive commitment to equality, or the
aims of real-world egalitarian movements, as is shown by WEALTHY MAN.

b\. [**Egalitarian theories** consistently provide reasons to **favour
more equal distributions of wealth. Given DMU of wealth and** the
**effects of relative poverty,** utilitarianism meets this
criterion.]{.underline} Those reasons are sometimes outweighed, but this
is true of all plausible egalitarian theories.

c\. Egalitarian theories favour more equal distributions of something
intrinsically. This is not true of utilitarianism, but neither is it
true of NIE or relational egalitarianism.

d\. [Where egalitarian theories do not favour more equal distributions
of something intrinsically, they favour them reliably]{.underline}, in
virtue of deep social facts. Utilitarianism meets this criterion at
least as well as NIE.

e\. Where egalitarian theories do not favour more equal distributions of
something intrinsically, they favour egalitarian social relations.
Utilitarianism meets this criterion, given the effects on well-being of
inegalitarian social relations, suggested by empirical studies and
various plausible theories of well-being.

f\. Where egalitarian theories do not favour more equal distributions of
something intrinsically, they favour egalitarian social relations
intrinsically. [Utilitarianism does not meet this criterion, but this is
unimportant, since it can still mandate policies to mitigate or
eliminate them (in most cases), account for the regrettableness of their
instantiation (in all cases) and explain their great
significance.]{.underline}

[I conclude, then, that we should treat utilitarianism as a form of
egalitarianism. No longer should utilitarians ignore egalitarian
concerns, or utilitarianism be rejected for ignoring them.]{.underline}

Criticism on Utilitarianism

As discussed at the beginning of this entry, utilitarianism has been
subject to fierce criticism. Typical criticisms are the following: (1)
utilitarianism has an inadequate theory of value; (2) utilitarianism
permits abhorrent actions, or at least actions that are wrong; (3)
utilitarianism is too demanding; (4) utilitarianism fails to respect the
separation of persons; and (5) utilitarianism is committed to
implausible claims about the psychology of persons.

However, when considering that Bentham, Austin, and Mill were all, to
some extent, rule-utilitarian and that Hare had a "two-level theory" of
utilitarianism, some of [this criticism against utilitarianism would be
weakened]{.underline}. For instance, [criticism]{.underline} (2)
[suggests that utilitarianism permits acts such as torture, enslavement,
organ snatching, wrong punishment,]{.underline} and the like (Woodard
2019, 212). However, Hare's two-level theory, for instance, can reply
that the [**prima facie principles** used at the intuitive level would
typically **forbid these acts**]{.underline}. Although (4) is a widely
accepted criticism, section "Classical Utilitarian Theories" showed
that, in Bentham's theory, [the secondary principle of the
**security-providing principle** and those rights that are derived from
that principle could do the **same jobs as Rawls's social primary
goods** and enable the pursuit of diverse goods]{.underline}. On the
other hand, criticism (5) holds that utilitarianism favor "pervasive
calculation," which would require people to use calculation in every
decision. However, as seen in section "Modern Utilitarian Theories",
Mill urged people to follow the rules of morality. [Hare, relying on his
distinction of levels of thinking, argues that at the intuitive level,
"such calculations are in practice usually impossible and... \[w\]e
would do better to stick to well tried and general
principles]{.underline}" (Hare 1981, 121).

Criticism (3) argues that utilitarianism is, by some, taken to require
people to work tirelessly for others to maximize the well-being of a
society (Woodard 2019, 213). This point is particularly true of Singer's
utilitarianism, but as Postema claims, Bentham, for instance, tried to
articulate a [public **philosophy primarily for legislators and
constitution designers** (Postema 2019, 56). Thus, Bentham's principle
of utility would not force people to be altruistic.]{.underline}

The most troublesome criticism for utilitarians might be criticism (1)
that relates to the difficulty of sum-ranking or measurement of pleasure
and pain. For Bentham, pleasure and pain are basic units of value.
Postema argues, however, "this thought raises a number of questions, ...
\[such as\] how are these essentially subjective values to be measured,
related, and weighed with respect to each individual and combined to
yield a meaningful assessment for each proposed act, law, or
institution" (Postema 2019, 73). In Postema's interpretation, however[,
Bentham did not rely on people's pleasure, which is varied, but on basic
or universal interests which are standard within a particular society
(ibid, 127). **Bentham's universal interest was meant to incorporate
each member's security of person, property condition in life, and
reputation**,]{.underline} which would be, as discussed in section
"Classical Utilitarian Theories", introduced by the security providing
principle and sanctioned by the provisions of his Pannomion. Hare, on
the other hand, took a more straightforward approach. According to Hare,
to provide moral judgments based on the desires and preferences of all
those affected by the action, "\[t\]he most that human beings can ask
for, when they are trying to do the best critical thinking they can, is
some way of approximating, perhaps not at all fully, to the thoughtful
process of an archangel" (Hare 1981, 122).

### Liberal Util\-\--1NC

**Liberal Utilitarianism solves concerns about overfocus on the future
and the utilitarian monster**

of Social Science from the University of Helsinki, "Just Better
Utilitarianism", *Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics*,

// GBH

Liberal Utilitarianism

The theory of liberal utilitarianism, as I devised it, operates on six
principles. They are:

[1) The greatest need satisfaction principle.]{.underline}

An act, omission, rule, law, policy, or reform is the right one if and
only if it produces, or can be reasonably expected to produce, at least
as much need satisfaction as any other alternative which is open to the
agent or decisionmaker at the time of the choice.

[2) The principle of hierarchical needs.]{.underline}

When the need satisfaction produced by various action alternatives is
assessed, **[those needs which are hierarchically at a less basic level
shall be considered only if the action alternatives in question do not,
or cannot be expected to, produce an effect upon the satisfaction of
needs at a more basic level.]{.underline}**

[3) The principle of other-regarding need frustration.]{.underline}

When the need satisfaction produced by various action alternatives is
assessed, the most basic needs of one individual or group shall be
considered only if the satisfaction of those needs does not frustrate
the needs of others at the same hierarchical level.

[4) The principle of necessary and contingent ends.]{.underline}

Needs are hierarchically at a more basic level if and **[only if their
satisfaction is conceptually linked with the achievement of necessary
ends like survival, health, well-being, and happiness.]{.underline}**
Needs are hierarchically at a less basic level if and only if their
satisfaction is conceptually linked only with the achievement of
contingent ends.

[5) The principle of awareness.]{.underline}

When the need satisfaction produced by various action alternatives is
assessed, the needs of individual beings shall be considered only if the
beings in question can consciously anticipate, sense, or perceive,
directly or indirectly, the loss involved in the frustration of those
needs.

[6) The principle of autonomy.]{.underline}

When the need satisfaction produced by various action alternatives is
assessed, need satisfaction which is freely and informedly chosen by
autonomous individuals shall be preferred to the need satisfaction of
the same individuals which is not.Footnote 126

All these principles will be useful in the defense of the theory, but
let me also cite the condensed version, which I meant to cover all the
points:

LU The Essence of Liberal Utilitarianism

According to liberal utilitarianism, [**it is** always right to
**maximize the satisfaction of needs, provided that the satisfaction of
the more basic needs for survival, health, well-being and happiness is
not prevented by the satisfaction of less basic needs,** and provided
that the basic needs of individuals and groups are not in
conflict]{.underline}. The needs to be accounted for must be
recognizable to the beings who have them, except in the case of
autonomy. In the case of autonomous beings, self-determined need
satisfaction is to be preferred to other types of need
satisfaction.Footnote 127

Principles 1--6 explain the details, whereas LU presents the doctrine
more concisely.

What we have here, then, is a [theory that retains maximization and the
impersonal definition of the good]{.underline}, albeit in a new sense,
and impartiality as it appears in classical utilitarianism. [The key is
the revised axiology based on hierarchical needs]{.underline} (which I
may or may not have invented).Footnote 128 I also augmented the theory
with five principles for application.Footnote 129 In the first one, I
specified that we should regard all decisions (including laws, policies,
and the like) as individual acts. This was an attempt, successful or
not, to get rid of the act versus rule controversy. The second was a
confession of faith in the symmetry of acts and omissions, a fundamental
utilitarian tenet that many scholars have defended, sometimes in a
question-begging way, in bioethics.Footnote 130 , Footnote131 The third
was a commitment to foreseeable rather than actual consequences. If we
want to make reasoned decisions, we cannot appeal to the actual outcomes
of our actions because we do not know them at the time of the choice.
The fourth, an attempt to circumvent a version of the repugnant
conclusion, is worth reprinting here:

7\) The principle of actual or prospective existence.

[When the moral rightness of human activities is assessed, **the
imagined needs of nonexistent beings who will never come into existence
shall not be counted.**]{.underline}

As long as we abide by this rule, we do not have an obligation to
reproduce every time we could have offsprings with tolerable lives. In
time, this conviction paved way for the antinatalist view that I now
apparently hold.Footnote 132 My fifth guide for applying the doctrine
was "the principle of positive utilitarianism," stating that [promoting
happiness and removing or alleviating suffering are both apt goals for
right action]{.underline}. With my current antinatalist stance, I seem
to have abandoned this tenet since and moved into the direction of
negative utilitarianism, according to which minimizing suffering is
primary.Footnote 133 Straying from some of the auxiliary rules for
application is not fatal, as, to cite my original words, "these axioms
are not necessarily held by all liberal utilitarians."Footnote 134

Does liberal utilitarianism solve the problems of its classical
predecessor, then? Well, yes and no. Let us begin with the repugnant
conclusion. Would it be preferable, according to my theory, to have a
world of billions of sentient beings whose needs are just about
satisfied, or a world with millions of sentient beings whose every need
is satisfied? My formulation of liberal utilitarianism squirms out of
this issue instead of confronting it directly. [Given the proper
caveats, it is always right to satisfy the needs of those who exist, but
**the theory entails no obligation to create more beings with
needs.**]{.underline} It is preferable to have the needs of the many
rather than the needs of the few or none satisfied, so in this sense the
world with the smaller population is better. Counted one by one, the
world with the larger population could have more needs satisfied than
the world with the smaller population, but comparisons like this are
inane. Needs and their satisfaction are not quantifiable and aggregative
entities in a sense that would support such considerations. This account
seems logical to me now, although the introduction of rule 7 above
indicates that, in 1994, I was less sure about it.

Next up is the utility monster. Does liberal utilitarianism endure its
challenge? In one way it does, in another it does not, but that is not
necessarily a bad thing. [Since need satisfaction is not reifiable and
calculable like hedonic utility supposedly]{.underline} is,Footnote 135
[no one sentient being can gorge it up at the expense of all
others]{.underline}. This does not solve, however, the problem entirely.
In some situations, the resources needed for the survival or health of
one person are so great that hundreds of others have to forgo the
satisfaction of some relatively important needs. My model cuts
out---remains silent in the case of---conflicts between more basic
needs, so the sacrificed needs cannot include life, health, well-being,
or happiness. They can still be consequential to those experiencing
them. We do not have to go further than to the cost of some drugs for
rare diseases, which can drain local healthcare resources (in societies
with public services), causing major inconvenience to many.Footnote 136
Should we opt for the survival of one at the expense of others?
Depending on the definition of the major inconveniences, liberal
utilitarianism might have to recommend it and thereby surrender to the
utility monster. The question then is: Is the recommendation so clearly
counterintuitive that we have to abandon the theory? Not necessarily, I
would suggest, as our intuitions on cases like these are not that well
defined.

[Does liberal utilitarianism commit the naturalistic fallacy and does it
matter**? It would do that, if it defined needs as objective entities,
but it should be clear by now that it does not. "More basic needs" and
"less basic needs"** are shorthand for values that we can specify in
many ways]{.underline}, just bearing in mind that what the first
category picks out is somehow obviously more important than what the
second does. Challenge met, I believe, but the question of definition
becomes crucial, and this must be born in mind.

Is liberal utilitarianism unprovable? Yes, in that, it has no
geometrical proof. No, in that, we can, and must, continuously test its
justification against our intuitions in various situations. Is it
infeasible, in other words, does it commit us to calculations that are
impossible to make? Yes, if we try to take into account everything that
our actions and inactions cause. No, if we limit our attention to
foreseeable consequences. This leaves questions that I will have to
answer separately.Footnote 137

The issues of morality, moral integrity, justice, and self-sacrifice
were focal to my development of the liberal utilitarian view, and they
should not cause insurmountable problems. So what should we do in a
trolley situation and, more generally, what should we think about losing
the lives of some innocent people to save the lives of many others?
Talking purely about head counts, my theory "solves" these cases by
refusing to make the judgment and by hinting that they should be decided
on other grounds. I present these grounds in the concluding chapter of
the book as the methods of applied ethics.Footnote 138 Long story short,
I suggest that when the more basic needs of different individuals or
groups are in conflict, we have to seek solutions in further
examination. This draws a line between what liberal utilitarianism can
and cannot do. The further examination that I call for consists of two
steps. We must first assess suggested solutions to moral and political
problems for their logical consistency and conceptual coherence. This
is, philosophically speaking, a straightforward matter. In the second
step, we should evaluate the intuitive and emotional acceptability of
the solutions that have survived the first step. This evaluation means
testing views and recommendations against real-life and imaginary
examples. I borrowed this idea from Jonathan Glover and recognized, like
him, that it is more controversial.Footnote 139 Whose intuitions and
emotions are we talking about here? The answer, presumably, is "ours,"
but who are "we"? Eventually, this question, with the definition of more
and less basic needs, decides whether my model holds together. These
issues require careful investigation, which respects the
hypothetico-deductive, aspirationally "scientific," spirit of the
endeavor.

In all the counterexamples to classical utilitarianism that involve
sacrifices and self-sacrifices, basic needs are in conflict, which means
that liberal utilitarianism leaves them for applied ethics to solve.
Jim's case, stated as I do above, could be an exception. If the person
whom Jim is supposed to kill dies anyway by the hand of someone else in
the same situation, then the choice is between letting and not letting
the 19 others die. This is how utilitarians interpret the case, and this
is why they often end up advising that Jim should do the deed. I do not
want to make that judgment and neither does liberal utilitarianism. When
I built the theory, this interpretation must have slipped my mind, as
axioms 1--6 do not seem to cover it. For now, let us just assume the
necessary revisions to them or a new application principle that supports
the withdrawal.
