[The President should deliver a major address explaining the **role**
energy security **plays** in preserving the nation's security and that
of its allies, including the contributions made by nuclear toward
fulfilling national security imperatives through the preservation of a
safe, secure, and effective deterrent, providing reliable emissions-free
energy to meet growing electricity demands despite changes in weather,
and promoting US interests worldwide through nuclear exports. President
Eisenhower's "Atoms for Peace" speech still provides a vital frame of
reference for this imperative and should inform the vision for US
nuclear leadership and the actions that the President will
require]{.underline}. The address should articulate the advantages to US
national security and economic interests of maintaining and expanding
the US nuclear fleet, as well as the risks associated with continuing US
dependency on foreign state-owned enterprises in general and Russian and
Chinese nuclear fuel imports in particular. The address should
underscore the US commitment to international cooperation, including
through the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA), working with the more than twenty nations that
pledged at the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change's 28th
Conference of Parties (COP 28) to triple nuclear energy capacity by
2050.23 It should describe the roadmap of actions needed to restore the
United States as the partner of choice for nations seeking to start or
expand their nuclear power programs.

[The President should launch a major international security program to
strengthen US nuclear energy leadership abroad through a comprehensive,
integrated, whole-of-government approach. The President should commit to
significant resources over the next five years in this effort and
explain the geopolitical and economic security imperatives of doing so.
Some components of this program could include ensuring adequate
personnel capacity for conducting this work, creating dedicated lending
budget lines by the Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and US
Export-Import EXIM, and launching a fund for equity investment in US
energy solutions abroad]{.underline}. This recommendation is informed by
estimates that US nuclear market revenues could reach up to \$1.9
trillion by 2050. Failure to take effective action would effectively
cede 100-year strategic relationships to geostrategic rivals and
adversaries while allowing the high nonproliferation standards the
United States and its allies have established over decades to erode from
neglect or worse. That cannot be in the US national security or economic
interest.24 The US government should also exercise its authority and
diplomatic leverage to prevent the misappropriation of US technology for
commercial purposes, the misuse of trade restrictions, or other unfair
trade practices to create commercial advantages benefiting foreign
competitors to US companies.

[The President should host a Leaders' Summit on Nuclear Energy,
including participation from state and local governments, NGOs,
businesses, and indigenous communities, focused on considering the
questions and solutions articulated in this report and
beyond]{.underline}.25 The 2021 summit launched multiple climate and
energy initiatives, including the Department of State's Foundational
Infrastructure for the Responsible Use of Small Modular Reactor
Technology (FIRST) program and the Chair's Council on Climate, a
sub-committee of the US Export-Import (EXIM) Bank's Advisory Committee
dedicated to advising on how to better support US exporters in clean
energy.26 For the next summit, deliverables should include the
following:

[A roadmap for extending the licenses of all US reactors, for
incentivizing uprates to increase their output, and for increasing the
deployment of Gen III+ and advanced reactors domestically]{.underline}.
This roadmap should include maintaining and expanding tax credits for
existing and new reactors, as well as low-interest loans for new nuclear
generation projects.

[A strategy for deploying nuclear technologies to reduce emissions
outside the power generation sector, with specific incentives to ensure
deployment]{.underline}. For example, the extensive maritime energy
market (e.g., the global shipping industry) could potentially field new
nuclear technology demonstrations. The Secretary of Energy and Secretary
of Defense should develop measures to incentivize further action in the
maritime domain, alongside diplomacy, to advance international safety
standards. The oil market also presents opportunities

[A five-year plan to increase domestic production of supply chain
components, including uranium conversion and enrichment]{.underline}, as
well as processing of the critical minerals needed for nuclear and other
clean energy technologies.

[The US government should offer cost overrun insurance for first-movers
in building advanced reactors and domestic fuel facilities and
appropriate sufficient]{.underline} funds to catalyze the investment
needed to deploy the first five advanced reactors.

[The Chairman of the National Energy Council should provide an
interagency roadmap of nuclear supply chain needs to the President. The
roadmap will identify domestic actions needed to relieve chokepoints to
ensure a resilient energy infrastructure]{.underline}, identify specific
countries to partner with in deploying US reactors abroad and create a
plan for building an alliance of partner nations to share best practices
around civil nuclear technology and to review and modernize standards
and norms for safe deployment.

[The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) should engage all Executive
Branch agencies to prioritize nuclear energy initiatives in the
President's next budget. The next administration's first budget cycle
will begin swiftly, and OMB instruction is a key mechanism for
reflecting the president's priorities in the intra-departmental budget
negotiations that take place each year]{.underline}. This is especially
important given that enacting this agenda will likely require the
Executive Branch to request several "new starts" or new budget line
items.

[The Secretary of the Treasury should lead efforts to ensure that the
World Bank, other multilateral development banks, and international
financial institutions reverse their long-standing opposition to
financial support for nuclear projects and dedicate significant
resources to enabling the fulfillment of the COP28 tripling
pledge.]{.underline} For years, the World Bank has supported major
energy infrastructure projects, but its refusal to support nuclear
projects has been a drag on the financial viability of an energy source
that is indispensable to international climate targets. International
Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi correctly labeled
this policy "out of step" with the desires of World Bank shareholders
and called for reconsideration of this policy. Many members of Congress
have also urged this move. These restrictions should also be abandoned
by all other multilateral development banks and financial institutions;
the World Bank should take the lead in this and provide confidence to
others to follow suit. In the absence of such reform, efforts to
establish an International Bank for Nuclear Infrastructure have taken
root and should be encouraged.

[The Secretary of State should target regaining US leadership in nuclear
energy as a top diplomatic priority. Immediate actions the Secretary
could pursue include significantly increasing internal resources for the
FIRST program and promoting a higher funding level in the President's
next budget]{.underline}, instructing the Global Engagement Center to
establish a dedicated line of communications to counter disinformation
on US nuclear energy solutions, and exercising the authority as chair of
the Development Finance Corporation (DFC) Board of Directors to
accelerate DFC support for nuclear energy projects abroad.

[The Secretary of State, Secretary of Energy, and Chairman of the
National Energy Council should endorse and encourage more governments to
also commit to triple nuclear energy capacity by 2050 and report to the
President on progress toward that objective]{.underline}. At the 2023
COP28 meetings in Dubai, over 20 countries, including the United States,
signed a declaration to triple nuclear power capacity globally by
2050.27 This pledge, along with other recent multilateral commitments,
such as the US-China joint statement on tripling renewables to
substitute for fossil fuels, indicates that nuclear-capable nations
recognize the urgency to decarbonize their energy sectors and the
importance of collaboration to maximize doing so in a way that promotes
nuclear security, safety, and nonproliferation.28

[The Secretary of State should accelerate the negotiation of Section 123
Agreements. Renewed US leadership, commitments, and resources promoting
the peaceful uses of nuclear technologies are essential to keeping the
international nonproliferation regime robust and promoting]{.underline}
the United States as a partner of choice in this arena. Department of
State objectives should be integrated into an overall strategy led by
the Chairman of the National Energy Council, including the following
steps:

#### NATO prompts direct action for energy development in the Arctic due to growing environmental concerns

Maddy **Bennet** **20**, BS in Psychology and BA in International
Relations; "NATO's Role in Securing a Changing Arctic" The Henry M.
Jackson School of International Studies at the University of Washington;

AS

NATO has a history of researching and accounting for climate change,
which will likely inform its future decisions about involvement in the
Arctic. NATO has recognized environmental changes as a potential
security threat since 1969 but did not officially add climate change to
its Strategic Concept until 2010 (Causevic 2017, 72). [In 2020, as NATO
prepares to create its new Strategic Concept that will guide its
actions, the outsize impact of climate change on the Arctic relative to
other world regions has become apparent]{.underline} (Lanteigne 2019).
Since 1961, the average temperature in Oslo, Norway has increased by 2
degrees Celsius; beyond the Arctic Circle it has gone up by 5.6 degrees
(Schellnhuber et al. 2019). [NATO leadership recognizes the impact of
climate change, even its potential to cause or exacerbate geopolitical
conflicts]{.underline} (Causevic 2017, 60). [Yet due to its status as a
military alliance and not a governing or regulatory body, NATO's hands
appear to be tied when it comes to defeating climate
change]{.underline}.

[NATO has confronted energy-related threats before, but the challenges
emerging in the Arctic are somewhat different]{.underline}. Previously,
NATO has had to contend with Russia manipulating energy shipments to
European countries for political reasons and exploiting potential
conflicts of interest in energy markets to sow divisions among NATO
members. This was exemplified by the Nord Stream pipelines. NATO was
wary of the pipelines, especially because they suspected that there was
an ulterior motive to the decision to have the pipeline bypass Ukraine.
However, the Alliance did not directly get involved militarily (Valášek
2019, 43). [Unlike the energy security debates that used to concern
NATO, questions about the Arctic may prompt a direct
response.]{.underline} [Climate change in the Arctic certainly has
economic- and shipping-related dimensions, but it will also have much
bigger environmental ramifications than the Nord Stream
pipelines]{.underline} (Lanteigne 2019). NATO must now also consider the
sovereignty of Arctic Indigenous peoples and of states outside its
membership and core area of activity as the Alliance prepares to face
northward.

The Arctic is becoming an active zone for infrastructure development and
a convenient avenue for transportation, both of which could contribute
to increased tensions. The Arctic has vast deposits of fossil fuels and
rare earth elements like gold, silver, and uranium. Russia and China are
quickly moving to build facilities for the extraction and trade of these
resources, as are Finland, the U.S., Canada, and Norway (Dillow 2011).
Along with opportunity, economic developments in the Arctic can bring
conflict. [With increasing traffic in Arctic waters will come "more
incidents at sea and environmental accidents, which will require careful
management to ensure they do not escalate"]{.underline} (Boulègue 2019,
32). With so many actors, high economic stakes, and existing tensions
between the U.S., Russia, and China, it is possible that even contact
through everyday activities could become magnified into a crisis. Russia
is not helping matters by augmenting its Arctic military presence
(Lanteigne 2019) now that new sea routes from which they could attack
Norway have opened (Valášek 2019, 47). [Arctic militarization, also
underway in Norway with help from NATO, has not yet flared into
violence. However, that only means the timing is right for NATO to
clarify its strategy in the region and help establish norms so that
Arctic economic opportunities do not escalate tensions over natural
resources, with the environment being among the casualties.]{.underline}

### Capitalism K\-\--1NC

#### The 1AC's capitalist exploration and development of the Arctic [ensures]{.underline} nuclear war and miscalculation through resource wars.

**Arnove '8** \[Anthony, May 2\] \[Marxist author and board member of
Haymarket Books\] \[Scramble for the Poles, Socialist Worker\]
\[https://socialistworker.org/2008/05/02/scramble-for-the-poles\] \[cf\]

[\"[THE NEED of a]{.mark} constantly [expanding market]{.mark} for its
products [chases the]{.mark} [bourgeoisie over]{.mark} the entire
surface of [the globe]{.mark}]{.underline},\" Marx and Engels wrote in
the Communist Manifesto. \"[It must nestle everywhere, settle
everywhere**.\"**]{.underline}

[[The struggle for natural resources]{.underline}]{.mark}\--today,
energy resources particularly\--also [[forces]{.mark} [capitalists
to]{.mark} \"nestle everywhere, [settle
everywhere.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}

But [when we imagine the dynamics of global capitalism]{.underline} 160
years after the writing of the Manifesto, [we]{.underline} usually
[don\'t think of]{.underline} either [the North or South
Pole]{.underline}\--the Arctic and Antarctic\--as a particular site of
struggle.

Yet today [[a new scramble for control of]{.mark} the two [polar regions
is unfolding]{.mark}, with [consequences]{.mark} that [could further
hasten capitalism\'s destruction]{.mark} of the planet and also
[increase the likelihood that]{.mark} the economic [competition]{.mark}
between states will [spill over into military
competition]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The backdrop to the [renewed [interest in]{.mark} [asserting territorial
claims on the Arctic]{.mark} and Antarctic]{.underline} by states such
as Canada, the United States, Russia and the United Kingdom is that
global warming, and in particular the warming of oceans, [[is]{.mark}
[leading to accelerating erosion of the ice mass]{.mark}z at both
poles.]{.underline}

Rather than seeing this as a global crisis, as any person concerned for
the fate of the planet and humanity would, [the governments who have
land claims on the polar regions see this as a terrific
opportunity.]{.underline}

Why? Because [the [retreating ice shelves]{.mark} may [open up]{.mark}
new [territory for oil and natural gas exploration and]{.mark} may also
open easier [shipping routes]{.mark}]{.underline}, including perhaps the
long-sought Northwest Passage linking the Atlantic and Pacific.

In other words, the [harmful [effects of global warming]{.mark} may
[open opportunities for]{.mark} [further accelerating]{.mark} the
harmful effects of [global warming]{.mark}.]{.underline}

\"According to the U.S. Geological Survey, [up to a quarter of the
world\'s undiscovered oil and gas may lie beneath the polar seabed\--far
more than Saudi Arabia\'s total known reserves\--along with vast mineral
wealth,\"]{.underline} Oliver Burkeman wrote in Britain\'s Guardian.

As oil becomes harder to extract and produce cheaply[, forcing oil
companies and governments to go to more difficult political and
geographic terrain to find oil and natural gas, any potential new source
of oil is tantalizing, particularly if it is not controlled by
independent political powers]{.underline} such as Hugo Chávez in
Venezuela or Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran. [This]{.underline}\--and the
opening of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge\--is [what [\"energy
independence,\" the new mantra]{.mark} [of]{.mark} Democrats and
Republicans alike, really means.]{.underline}

[Damn [the consequences for people and the planet.]{.mark}]{.underline}

AND [AS overfishing leads to a crisis in the global fishing industry,
extending control over waters beyond a state\'s boundaries to monopolize
areas of the sea that were once off limits or shared international
waters, is also a newly important goal.]{.underline}

\"The 1982 United Nations [[Law of the Sea]{.mark}]{.underline}
convention [[provides a legal framework for]{.mark} [delineating
ownership]{.mark} and economic rights [but the U.S. has yet to ratify
it]{.mark},\"]{.underline} notes Barbara Yaffe of the Vancouver Sun.
\"In accordance with the convention, [circumpolar states are busily
mapping undersea turf to establish their own claims, as yet to be
adjudicated.\"]{.underline}

[\"Britain is preparing to stake a claim to nearly one million square
kilometres\"]{.underline} of the Antarctic, Jax Jacobsen of Red Pepper
magazine reports. Jacobsen notes that Chile and Argentina, seeking to
challenge UK claims related to Falkland Islands and South Georgia,
\"have even gone so far as to fly pregnant women down to their Antarctic
research bases to strengthen their land claims\" by having \"native
\'Antarctican\'\" citizens.

Meanwhile, Canada and Russia in particular have been stepping up
military operations and staking competing claims to the Arctic.

Canadian journalist Avi Lewis, host of a new program on Al-Jazeera
called Inside USA, says, \"[The Conservative government has dashed up to
stake a claim to the market opportunity afforded by melting
glaciers\--[the tragic realization of the]{.mark} original [colonial
dream for a Northwest]{.mark} passage]{.underline}. Stephen Harper has
been striking a nationalist posture of \'standing up to big brother\' on
Arctic sovereignty\--from shipping to resource extraction.\"

And, as Oliver Burkeman writes, \"[Russia,]{.underline} in the most
audacious move so far, [dispatched a nuclear-powered icebreaker and two
submersible craft to plant a Russian flag, housed in a titanium tube, on
the seabed directly beneath the North Pole. \'The Arctic is ours,\'
declared]{.underline} lead explorer Artur Chilingarov, thereby staking
[Moscow\']{.underline}s claim to 460,000 square miles of ocean floor,
more than five times the area of Britain. [Canada]{.underline},
apparently taken by surprise, [responded by pledging a major military
build-up in the north.\"]{.underline}

Unlike the Antarctic, [the Arctic is not a nuclear-free
zone]{.underline}. So [[the risk]{.mark} of the
[Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} (and perhaps eventually also the Antarctic)
[[becoming a site for nuclear weapons]{.mark} and the passage of nuclear
submarines, with the increased risk of nuclear accident or war, [is
serious]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Indigenous communities in the Arctic are likely to be
displaced]{.mark}]{.underline} by the new settlement concerned based on
extraction of the region\'s resources and with establishing a military
presence.

Since 1945, for the first time in history, [**[human]{.mark}**
being**[s]{.mark}** have **[developed a]{.mark} clear [capacity to
destroy]{.mark}** conditions conducive to the continuation of **human
[life on the planet]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Ascendant in the post-war
world order, [[nuclear imperialism has **facilitated the invasion**,
**occupation, division,**]{.mark} **and [dispossession]{.mark}** [of
the]{.mark} affected [lands they own]{.mark} and belong to, [and the
**water, food, and air** they require]{.mark} to sustain healthy
lives.]{.underline} In even a limited exchange of nuclear weapons,
organised [human **[existence would be terminated]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Helfland 2013). [This could also occur [over]{.mark} a longer period of
[time, through]{.mark} ingestion of on-going [release]{.mark}s
[of]{.mark} 'low-level' [radiation into the environment]{.mark} from
**uranium mines, uranium-related weapons use, nuclear reactors, and
waste sites**.]{.underline} As the effects of radiation on the unborn
and very young are far more critical than on a mature adult,
[[adults]{.mark} may [pass on the effects]{.mark} of cellular damage
[through reproduction]{.mark} **even if** the harm they receive is
ostensibly minimal.]{.underline} Through the intensification of cellular
damage from accumulated and magnified radiation [[leading to
**infertility,**]{.mark} **[humans]{.mark} could [extinguish
themselves]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

The long latency periods from the bioaccumulation of radiotoxic
materials have made it easier to conceal the effects from the past two
centuries of mining, atomic tests, power plants and dumping. As nuclear
technology is a pillar of the new imperialism, [the global [nuclear
industry has]{.mark} steadily [captured]{.mark} and funnelled enormous
human, technical, and financial [resources]{.mark} away from localised
industries]{.underline} such as manufacturing and food and energy
production, toward the centres of capital. With few incentives for
rigorous monitoring and safety programmes at nuclear sites, particularly
in poorer economies such as in Namibia or Congo but also in the
'internal colonies' of wealthier economies such as Japan, the US,
Canada, or Australia, the exposure and replacement of workers (casual,
menial, itinerant, nonwhite, or indigenous) provides a bulwark to absorb
the violence of capital accumulation. While [disseminated [confusion
regarding]{.mark} health [risks]{.mark} serves to [blur
causation]{.mark}]{.underline} between exposure and illness, a
biopolitical [regime [shields]{.mark} the experts, bureaucrats, and
business people from [liability for industrial
toxicity]{.mark}]{.underline}, at least in the short term. Invocations
of stability in the form of economic and political stability and
security have served to consolidate the transnational nuclear industry
in the new imperialism.

**Capitalist militarism guarantees [extinction.]{.underline}**

\[cf\]

Today the situation is qualitatively different. For two principal
reasons. First, the objective of the feasible [[war at the
present]{.mark} phase of historical development]{.underline}, in
accordance with the objective requirements of imperialism -- [[world
domination by capital's most powerful state,]{.mark} in tune with its
own political design of ruthless authoritarian
["globalization"]{.mark}]{.underline}(dressed up as "free exchange" in a
U.S.-ruled global market) -- [[is]{.mark} **ultimately
[unwinnable]{.mark}**, foreshadowing,]{.underline} instead, **[[the
destruction of humankind]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This objective by no
stretch of imagination could be considered a rational objective in
accord with the stipulated rational requirement of the "continuation of
politics by other means" conducted by one nation, or by one group of
nations against another. [[Aggressively imposing]{.mark} the will of
[one]{.mark} powerful [national state]{.mark} over all of the others,
even if for cynical tactical reasons the advocated war [is absurdly
**camouflaged**]{.mark} as a "purely limited war" [leading to other
"**open ended limited wars**]{.mark}",]{.underline} can therefore be
qualified only as total irrationality. The second reason greatly
reinforces the first. For [[the weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} already
[[available]{.mark} for waging the]{.underline} war or [wars of the
twenty first century [are capable of **exterminating**]{.mark} not only
the adversary but **[the whole of humanity]{.mark}**,]{.underline} the
first time ever in history. [Nor should we have **the illusion** that
the [**existing weaponry** marks the]{.mark} very **[end of the
road]{.mark}**. Others, even more [**instantly lethal** ones, might
appear **tomorrow** ]{.mark}**or the day after tomorrow**.]{.underline}
Moreover, [[threatening]{.mark} the use [of]{.mark} [such weapons
is]{.mark} by now [considered]{.mark} an [acceptable]{.mark} state
strategic device.]{.underline} Thus, put reasons one and two together,
and [[the]{.mark} [conclusion is **inescapable**: envisaging war as the
mechanism]{.mark} of global government in today's world
[underlines]{.mark} that we find ourselves at [the]{.mark} precipice of
[**absolute irrationality** from which there can be **no**
return]{.mark} if we accept the ongoing course of
development.]{.underline} What was missing from von Clausewitz's classic
definition of war as the "continuation of politics by other means" was
the investigation of the deeper underlying causes of war and the
possibility of their avoidance. The challenge to face up to such causes
is more urgent today than ever before. For the war of the twenty first
century looming ahead of us is not only "not winnable in principle".
Worse than that, it is in principle unwinnable. Consequently,
[[envisaging the pursuit of war]{.mark}, as the American
administration's]{.underline} September 17, 2002 strategic document
[does, **[make Hitler's irrationality look]{.mark} like the model of
[rational]{.mark}ity**.]{.underline}

The current crisis of the liberal world order manifested, primarily in
the outbreak of new wars of global significance, can be read and
diagnosed in many ways. [One is identifying it by radically questioning
the view that the globalized market can produce international order and
peace.]{.underline} The article reconstructs and investigates the main
theoretical assumptions of this view, tracing them, especially to the
marginalist tradition, whose historical-conceptual trajectory and main
effects it analyzes, from the scientific disputes of Eugen
Böhm-Bawerk's *Privatseminar* to the theoretical and militant activity
of Friedrich August von Hayek. Finally, the article turns to the main
effects of marginalism on global history, arriving at the thesis of its,
at least momentary, historic failure.

[[The]{.mark} idea that the globalized [free market]{.mark} constitutes
a device for world order and pacification [has been radically]{.mark}
challenged by the new and [increasingly grim war]{.mark} [scenarios of
global significance]{.mark}, notably the wars in Ukraine and
Palestine]{.underline} (Overbeek 2024; Todd 2024). The irenicism
associated with the so-called 'end of history' ushered in by the
collapse of the Berlin Wall has, therefore, inexorably lost credibility.
Even in the immediate aftermath of the Cold War, this ideal faced
continual threats as numerous conflicts erupted worldwide, as wars in
Yugoslavia. The U.S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq in the early
2000s intensified doubts despite neoconservative factions in the
American deep state framing these actions within a 'just war' rhetoric,
attempting to align them with the post-Cold War ideal of 1989 (Harvey
2003). Again, non-war but no less critical events, including the global
financial crisis of 2007--2008, the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the
crisis of Western democracies, and the environmental crisis, have
undoubtedly constituted further tests of the idea that the world market
is capable of ordering and pacifying the entire globe (Brown, 2015;
Calloni, 2023; Crouch, 2011; Mann and Wainwright, 2018; Tooze, 2021).
That this position was nothing less than an ideological cover for global
power asymmetries, or at least a pious illusion is, moreover, what has
been argued by anyone who has based their analysis on the theoretical
framework of political Realism or Marxism, [[whereby the
polemical]{.mark} element, now geopolitical, now class-based,
[constitutes the true foundation of the global free
market]{.mark}]{.underline} (Battistini et al., 2022), as well as
supranational institutions aimed at protecting human rights
(Scuccimarra, 2016, 236-242). While the former perspective now has a
hegemonic position within the international theoretical-political
debate, the latter is beginning to be rediscovered and discussed, albeit
minimally, within it. In this context, however, the theoretical
framework underpinning the assumed equation between free markets, order,
and peace has garnered less attention, likely because it appears
inadequate in explaining current events. This contribution takes a
different approach, proposing that isolating and analyzing the core
concepts of the theoretical framework advocating for the global market
may shed light on today's discussions around its crisis. Specifically,
the article examines Austrian marginalism, tracing its origins, major
developments and the impacts it has generated, finally asking under what
conditions it can be said to have failed today.

[[The relationship between the liberal market and war]{.mark} became an
explicit and systematic subject of discussion in the field of Austrian
marginalism in the early 20th century, notably in the Privatseminar
given by Eugen Böhm-Bawerk between 1905 and 1914.]{.underline} Three
times minister of finance in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Böhm-Bawerk
had been a student of Carl Menger, who was considered the one who
founded marginalist economics in Austria in the second half of the 19th
century. The latter does not constitute a rigid doctrinal orthodoxy, but
rather a set of theories elaborated differentially by its various
interpreters. Among these, the subjective theory of value and the theory
of cultural evolution are of radical importance. According to the
former, in a nutshell, the value of a commodity is not an objective
quantity that depends on the amount of labor required to produce it, as
according to classical labor-value theory; rather, it is a subjective
quantity determined from time to time by the encounter between the
different subjective valuations that economic actors (eminently
individuals, according to the assumption of methodological
individualism) attribute to it within the market, expressed in terms of
supply and demand. In other words, the value of a commodity is its
price, an emergent measure of the equilibrium that is spontaneously
produced in the market. Therefore, state intervention in the economic
field must be minimal so that it interferes as little as possible in the
dynamics of price formation, which allows the economic calculation from
which a rational economic order follows (Bonar 1888; Roncaglia 2017). On
the other hand, the theory of cultural evolution prescribes the
unreflective origin of the institutions that organize human life,
understood as undesigned artifices selected by cultural evolution over
time to coordinate the actions of individuals. Central to the
marginalist view is the belief that the liberal market constitutes the
most rational institution selected by cultural evolution since it
enables human cooperation without it being directed by the arbitrariness
of any centralized authority because it is made possible by the
impersonal and decentralized forces of the free market (Angner 2002).

Based on these arguments, the theorists of marginalism believe that any
form of economic dirigisme is potentially disruptive and identify
Marxism as one of their main polemical targets, deeming it not only an
undesirable political program but, above all, an entirely wrong
scientific framework. While Menger does not deal extensively with the
critique of Marxism, Böhm-Bawer devotes an entire volume to it published
in 1896, in which he refutes Karl Marx's Capital precisely since
marginalist principles (Böhm-Bawerk 2023). The polemic with Marxism does
not, at any rate, end in the pages of his work Karl Marx and the Close
of His System: A Criticism, but rather animates the discussions he
directed within his Privatseminar between liberal marginalists and
Marxists themselves: a situation that is perhaps only plausible if
contextualized within the very high-level cultural and scientific debate
active in early 20-century Vienna, the same one that Robert Musil
recorded, and ultimately aestheticized, in the following words, 'Kakania
was perhaps a home for genius after all. And that, probably, was the
ruin of it' (Musil 1965). Suspending judgment on the catastrophic
effects of genius, it seems complicated to deny at least the first
utterance, taking into consideration precisely the Privatseminar
discussions on the relationship between the free market and war, in
which key figures of world political and economic thought, including
Rudolf Hilferding, Ludwig von Mises, Joseph Schumpeter, Felix Somary,
Emil Lederer, Otto Neurath, Otto Bauer, Ewald, Karl Pribram, Richard
Strigl and Nikolai Bukharin, take part (Wassermann 2019).

[In Privatseminar, Hilferding defends the thesis set forth in his
monumental work Finance Capital (1910) in which he argues that [the
financialization of capital has]{.mark} as [its effect that of its
concentration]{.mark} and consequent exportation [by means of
expansionist policies carried out]{.mark} through [imperialist
wars,]{.mark} which are therefore [an effect of an economic
law.]{.mark}]{.underline} Underlying this law, there is, according to
Hilferding, the change in the organic composition of capital due to the
Second Industrial Revolution, which drives capitalists to invest in
technologies to maximize production, to the point where only a few
economic giants can sustain them, while all others must resort to
injections of financial liquidity. [From this follows an [enormous
growth in]{.mark} the importance of [the financial sector,]{.mark} in
which the same process of concentration takes place, until the latter
becomes stronger than the productive sector and, within it, competition
between financial trusts is generated, [the outcome of]{.mark} which is
[imperialism]{.mark}, that is, in the search for, [and subsequent
military construction of, new spaces from which to extract
profit]{.mark} (Hilferding, 2007).]{.underline} This is a fundamental
theory of Marxist thought, taken up and reworked (also with important
differences) by Rosa Luxemburg in The Accumulation of Capital (1913), by
Lenin in Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism (1917), as well as
by Nikolai Bukharin, who has a way of defending it not only in the work
Imperliasm and World Economy (1915) but also in Privatseminar itself.

Joseph Schumpeter and Ludwig von Mises acknowledge that monopolistic
concentration in both production and finance is a real tendency within
contemporary capitalist systems. However, they attribute this primarily
to external, non-economic factors rather than inherent tendencies within
capitalism. [For instance[, interventionist policies]{.mark} that
[distort competition]{.mark}, such as protectionism, often [encourage
the formation of monopolies and]{.mark} [cartels within individual
states.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[These]{.mark} internal monopolistic
s[tructures]{.mark}, in turn, can [lead to interstate tensions
and]{.mark}, ultimately, to [the outbreak of wars]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Based on his sociological theory of classes, elaborated in two texts,
published in 1917 and 1927, respectively, Schumpeter asserts in this
perspective that war is nothing but an atavism carried on by the
imperialistic-feudal aristocratic classes, who intend to preserve their
privileges and wealth, at that chronological height undermined by the
bourgeois-entrepreneurial classes, who have no interest in war conflict,
since the condition for their activity is the international order; they,
therefore, are vehicles of pacifism (Schumpeter 1966).

Geography, University of British Columbia\] \[*The Social Constructions
of Arctic Ocean Space*,

\[cf\]

[[The]{.mark} land-like [social construction views the ocean as a
resource]{.mark} which can be used in everyday life. It is a resource of
food and connection and, being an integral part of everyday life, is
[suitable for territorial claims and]{.mark} exertions of
[power]{.mark}.]{.underline} Steinberg believes this model to fit with
the interaction of society and ocean-space seen in Micronesia up until
recent times. He claims that, "For the Micronesias, the ocean is seen
primarily as a resource provider, divided into distinct places, much as
continental residents view their land-space" (Steinberg 2001, 52-3). In
this construction [the ocean is viewed as one may view a highway: it did
not divide societies]{.underline} within Micronesia, [but rather connect
them]{.underline} and was a fundamental part of common heritage and
daily experience.

Steinberg's third social construction of ocean-space is that of [[a
placeless force-field]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is a construction that
[[holds ocean-space as an arena of competition and]{.mark} potential
[militarism. Societal units]{.mark} vie for power on land, [using the
ocean as a buffer]{.mark} against potential threat, [separating]{.mark}
potentially [rebellious colonized]{.mark} areas [from the
hegemonic]{.mark} base of a single, strong [empire]{.mark}.]{.underline}
What is sought is not control of the ocean, which is not viewed as
land-like, but rather stewardship. The historical ocean-space that
Steinberg draws on here is the Mediterranean Sea, particularly during
the Roman period (c. 300 B.C.-C.E.500). [The ocean-space construction in
this model sits somewhere between a freedom/enclosure
dichotomy:]{.underline} "Rome constructed the Mediterranean as a
"force-field," a placeless surface that belonged to no one but upon
which powerful states could intervene do as to steward its resources for
the national interest.

[[The]{.mark} placeless [force-field]{.mark} construction
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} perhaps the [[closest]{.mark} of the three
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} [the manner in which [UNCLOS]{.mark} seems to
consider ocean-space]{.underline}, particularly with regards to EEZs:
"Within an EEZ... a coastal state may claim policing rights, but not
full sovereign authority, in the interest of stewarding the zone's
living and non-living resources" (Steinberg 1999, 261). [It is also
[similar to the position the US has taken]{.mark} with regards to the
world's oceans since the Second World War.]{.underline} On the other
hand, [[the]{.mark} great void [construction]{.mark} also [seems to
exist]{.mark} to a degree today, particularly [within]{.mark} the
mechanisms of [postmodern capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. Steinberg
states that, "With [[the]{.mark} \[postmodern capitalist\] era's
emphasis on movement and speed, the dominant element of postmodern
capitalism's ocean-space [construction is a continuation of the]{.mark}
great void [ideal that characterized the industrial capitalist
era]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Steinberg 2001, 164).

As well as his three major social constructions of ocean-space,
Steinberg also gives a helpful list of factors to consider when
determining the meaning of an area of water (Steinberg 2001, 42-3):

Overall conception of ocean-space

Uses of ocean-space

Regulations of ocean-space

Representations of ocean-space

Drawing on Steinberg's work cited above, which considers ocean-space
more generally, I wish to apply his theoretical principles to the Arctic
Ocean, in order to move closer to determining the social meaning of the
ocean-space in that region. Immediately [it becomes apparent that there
are [difficulties in determining a consistent conception of ocean-space
in the Arctic]{.mark}. With a plethora of competing commercial,
environmental, territorial, political, and cultural concerns, there does
not seem to be one single conception**.**]{.underline}

The Northwest Passage is an interesting example.
[[Canada]{.underline}]{.mark}, is an archipelago of islands in its far
north, [[claims the Northwest]{.mark} Passage to be within its internal
waters]{.underline}, as the section which passes through the Canadian
archipelago is within the archipelago itself, rather than the north side
of the islands. [[The US]{.mark},]{.underline} on the other hand,
[[considers]{.mark} the section of [the passage to be a]{.mark}n
international [straight]{.mark}]{.underline}, as it is wider than 12NM.
It is in US interests to keep freedom of movement in the seas for both
trade and military movement (Bush, Section 3.B Article 5). [The Canadian
government considers the passage to be a space, the US as a passage to
places. These [conflicting attempts at "fixing" ocean-space are
indicative]{.mark} of the [difficulties]{.mark} in [defining]{.mark} a
singular social construction of [the Arctic Ocean]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The US position of free and open seas can be seen as a continuation of
the principle of]{.underline} "mare liberum" (or "[open
seas]{.underline}") [which]{.underline} was [advocated]{.underline} by
the 16th-17th century jurist Hugo Grotius (1583-1645) and detailed in
his 1609 treatise, Mare Liberum. Grotius believed [that [**the deep seas
should be free** from]{.mark} sovereign [control and]{.mark} shipping
[ought not to be impeded]{.mark} by local control]{.underline}. This has
perhaps been the most influential construction of ocean-space and draws
on the great void construction.

In response to Grotius' treatise, his English contemporary and fellow
jurist, John Selden (1584-1654), constructed a "mare clausum" (or
"enclosed seas") ideal, published as "Mare Clausum," in 1635. [[This
ideal considers ocean-space to be]{.mark} an area of
[competition]{.mark} in the world polity in which, "each attempts to
seize as much of the ocean as possible for itself"]{.underline}
(Steinberg 2001, 39). [This construction is closer to the placeless
force-field ideal and can perhaps be seen in Canadian academic, policy,
and media discourse.]{.underline} In this discourse [[the Arctic
is]{.mark} often s[een as a region of insecurity]{.mark}, in which the
Canadian government should interact with it by increasing military
presence in the area]{.underline} (Borgerson; Carnaghan; Huebert 1999
and 2011).

[[The construction of Arctic]{.mark} ocean-space [by the Inuit]{.mark}
people [is wildly different]{.mark} to that of the US and Canadian
governments. In this case the ocean-space]{.underline}, which is in
large parts frozen during the coldest months, [is a space of resources,
connection, and a part of everyday life**.**]{.underline} Therefore [the
[uses of ocean-space]{.mark} would [suggest a social
construction]{.mark} which is [closest to the land-like model]{.mark}
that Steinberg suggests.]{.underline} As actual inhabitants of the
Arctic, **[the Inuit can be seen to be defined by and to define the
region.]{.underline}** This provides a direct challenge to the notion of
the Arctic being governed by distant states, questioning, "the scalar
assumptions of sovereignty itself" (Gerhardt et al, 999). The authors go
on: "With such a stance[, [the Inuit can be viewed as]{.mark} adopting
[a flat ontology]{.mark}, [whereby]{.mark} degrees and [spaces of
jurisdiction]{.mark} are [downplayed]{.mark} in favor of the actual
interactions [between the various parties who maintain]{.mark} specific
[interests in the region]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Gerhardt et al, 999).

floating nuclear power plants in South China Sea,\" Modern Diplomacy,

https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2023/04/04/china-floating-nuclear-power-plants-in-south-china-sea,
\-\--tw

China has been toying with the idea of developing floating nuclear power
plants for its islands in East Sea and South China Sea. This idea
germinated after it was felt that in order to sustain better radar and
signals interception facility in the islands controlled by China, given
the fact that power consumption is critical issue in many of these
islands. The power is also required for military installations and
quarters of the military person are located in those islands but the
idea which took shape in late 2016 was primarily aimed at looking   for
alternative power supply. The prototype of two nuclear power reactors
are already ready and are available for deployment. The power reactors
 60 megawatt and are of 30,000 tonne. The 2 power reactors are under
trial phases in Bohai Seas and it is possible that China might deploy 3
floating nuclear reactors in South China Sea by the year 2025.

There have been reports that there has been nuclear incident within
China in the year 2021 when in Guangdong province Taishan nuclear power
plant and leakage of radioactive material thereby contaminating the near
by areas .  In  this context there has been lot of tensions between the
EDF Group of France and the Chinese government as the French group held
30% of the shares in that plant. China has undermined that incident and
therefore there has been resistance within the highest military echelons
 related to deployment of floating nuclear power reactor. One of the
major proponents of floating nuclear power plant has been Russia which
has planned a  floating nuclear power reactor to open Arctic sea route
and thereby facilitating navigation as well as exploitation of the
resources of the Arctic.

However, deployment of floating nuclear reactors for the purposes of
sustaining habitation in far of islands and oil rigs which are being
developed by China's national nuclear corporation has its own
challenges. Russia, about 10 years back, was also trying to sell these
floating nuclear power plants which were the nuclear core retrieved from
retired nuclear submarines and placed on ships to act as a nuclear power
plants and many countries such as Nigeria and few African
countries.These  countries  have expressed interest in that. However,
the Russia could not deliver those nuclear power plants to those
customers because its own developmental phase was very slow and it could
only develop its first floating nuclear power plant which was proposed
to be developed at the cost of 170 million U.S. dollars and was finished
in the year 2018 with a substantial price escalation over and above the
actual price.

Following Russia's experimentation, China has also expressed desire to
develop it but interactions at the different levels between China and
Russia showcases that these nuclear power plants require security,
stability and extreme maintenance from sea water corrosion and other
effects. The problem with the nuclear power plants developed by China is
primarily related to connecting the required infrastructure to the grid
and thereby to the floating nuclear power plant, and the challenge of
keeping the core cool because sea water will be detrimental for cooling
the power plant. One important aspect for China is that these nuclear
power plants can provide power requirements to more than 100,000 people
and desalinate water enough for  60,000 people. But this kind of
capacity is not required as the population in many of these islands
controlled by China are much less than 5000 people. The second aspect is
that despite land reclamation by China many of these islands are low
lying islands and even if the nuclear power plant is stationed on a
ship, the problem is related to extreme land scarcity and challenges in
maintenance of these floating nuclear power plants. Very recently there
has been lot of debate with regard to releasing of contaminated water
into the sea from the meltdown of the Fukushima nuclear power plant.
Many Pacific island countries have strongly reacted against this and
with the development of the nuclear power plant by China and positioning
them in Chinese controlled islands in South China Sea will open a
 number of issues.The resistance would come from international
environmental groups .

Organizations such as Greenpeace and many other international NGOs are
strongly against this initiative. Any attempt by China to deploy its two
full fledged floating nuclear power plants in South China Sea islands
would be met with strong international resistance as these  are seen as
strategic sea lanes of communication. Furthermore,  India and US as well
as Japan and Australia are going to resist this initiative as it will
impact the safety and security of the trade cargo and also open a number
of issues with regard to a possible meltdown of the reactor and the
contamination of the marine life. Within China also coastal communities
living in Hainan islands and nearby areas are strongly resisting it
because they believe that in case of any contamination the 3^rd^ largest
fish resources area of South China Sea will be out of bounds in case of
any contamination or radiation leak.

Few of the former Chinese generals  are of the view that in case of any
accident the strategic utility of these islands will be completely
decimated because China will lose its soldiers and military personnel
because of radiation effects and also China will have to abandon those
islands because of these kinds of challenges. The better option would be
to connect these islands through an electricity grid drawn from the
mainland China or creating solar power grids and thereby explore
possibilities for connecting these far of islands.

China itself has been writing a lot with regard to floating nuclear
power plant and its utility but the incident of release of radioactive
waste from Taishan nuclear power plant in China has brought to the fore
the challenges of utilising nuclear power infrangible regions and
environmentally sensitive locations. It has been also learnt that civil
population from China is not willing to stay in these islands which do
not have any recreational facilities and have very limited interactions
with the mainland China. In fact exposure to radiation both in air and
water would lead to internal bleeding and death of exposed person. The
3^rd^ aspect which has been discussed within China is that the
radioactive material and its exposure might sustain itself for many
years and therefore how to take care of these challenges has been
discussed. China has also been discussing the possibility of working
with the Russian nuclear physicists to develop better stable nuclear
reactors. So far, Russia has refused to share any technology and
necessary skills related to developing nuclear power plants which are on
floating ships. The resistance is also coming from the provincial party
leaders within China as they believe that any accident in Bohai Sea and
in South China Sea would affect the livelihood of coastal communities
which are dependent on marine life in South China Sea and would create
long term challenges. The reported two completely developed reactors are
now located in Shandong province and are ongoing trials.The problem
faced are interrupting supply and issue of stable core reactor.

The impact on other claimants in South China Sea would be primarily from
the point of more militarisation of these islands and development of
more composite facilities which will be detrimental for Vietnam and
Philippines  as China will be definitely developing night landing
capacities in select islands and undertake operations of surveillance
and reconnaissance on a wider spectrum and far off islands. Second
aspect is related to self sustainment of many of these islands which
means relatively less reliance on mainland China for weekly supplies.The
3^rd^ aspect is related to creating larger security net both for
protection of the island and the floating nuclear power plant. Lastly,
the contamination of nearby waters and effect on the fisheries yield at
an annual level.

Introduction

Nuclear energy is now considered one of the key technologies for
mitigating climate change. According to the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA)1, the world nuclear electricity production is expected to
increase by about 29% from the 2021 level by 2030 in the low case
projection, and by more than 2.5-fold by 2050 in the high case. However,
the revival of the nuclear industry comes with its share of concerns.
Significant environmental and health concerns are generally associated
with nuclear power plant accidents2,3. There are indeed some
high-profile accidents that are still remembered, such as the Chernobyl
and Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant (NPP) accidents4.

Most [countries have **comprehensive** emergency response strategies in
case of an **NPP accident**]{.underline}. [In the US, the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission]{.underline} (**[NRC]{.underline}**) [provides
**guidance** on emergency responses]{.underline}. The NRC report
NUREG-03965 [introduces the concept of an Emergency Planning
Zone]{.underline} (**[EPZ]{.underline}**) as an area [within which
planning is recommended to enforce **swift** emergency and **evacuation
actions**]{.underline} in order to protect the public during an NPP
accident. EPZ is typically fixed as a 10-mile radius area around the
NPP, considering the possible external gamma radiation exposure and
inhalation exposure from the cloud of released radioactive gases and
deposited material.

During the Fukushima NPP accident, however, evacuation was done
successively from a 3 km radius, a 10 km radius, and then a 20 km
radius4. Cell phone data confirmed that the majority of the people were
evacuated before the biggest release and land contamination on Day 56.
At the same time, since [Japan's radioactive release and dose prediction
software]{.underline}, **[SPEEDI]{.underline}**, [was **not** properly
**used** to forecast **dose distributions**, and the monitoring network
was not functioning]{.underline}, [the evacuation process resulted in
**tremendous confusion** during the accident]{.underline}, as well as
generated distrust toward the government and nuclear industry after the
accident4. Ayoub et al.4 suggested that [emergency
responses]{.underline}, such as delineating the evacuation zones,
[should be **dynamic** and based on radionuclide transport
**forecasts**, which themselves should rely on **efficient monitoring
systems**]{.underline}.

To [enable such adaptive evacuation strategies, a radiation-monitoring
network should be able to effectively capture the extent of
**contamination** and **radiation levels** during the
accident]{.underline}. [There have been a number of approaches to the
design and optimization of an environmental monitoring
network]{.underline}, such as genetic algorithms (GA), spatial simulated
annealing (SSA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), ant colony
optimization (ACO), or surrogate-based approaches like the **[Gaussian
process]{.underline}** (GP) model. (The literature review of these
approaches is included in Sun et al.9.) In particular, GP [has **several
advantages**]{.underline} compared to others for optimizing a monitoring
network with built-in uncertainty quantification capabilities. In the
past, [GP has been used for interpolating sparse measurements or for
integrating **multiscale**, multitype **radiation
datasets**7]{.underline},8. Sun et al.9 has developed the
radiation-sensor-placement optimization methodology for capturing the
existing contamination using GP. Their approach is based on the "greedy"
algorithm, which involves adding one sensor at a time into the region
that has the highest interpolation error compared to the reference map
based on all the sensors. More recently, GP has been extended from the
physical space (i.e., locations) to general parameter spaces to
autonomously select parameter values for physics and chemistry
experiments10,11.

[**[Navigation]{.mark}** is [by **nature**]{.mark} a **[risky
activity]{.mark}**. The **[gravity]{.mark}** of the [Earth]{.mark} and
the fluidity of water (except for ice) mean that [all
**objects**]{.mark} at [sea]{.mark} are at [**risk** of
**sinking**]{.mark}. The [very purpose]{.mark} of ONPPs, to [produce
energy]{.mark} by nuclear means, [brings **additional
hazards**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The delivery of assistance to those in peril at sea is a central
principle of life at sea. It is also an ancient obligation of
international law and 'one of the traditional hallmarks of the law of
the sea'.73 [First and foremost, Article 98 of the LOSC requires every
(flag) State to require masters of ships flying their flags '[to
**render assistance**]{.mark} to [**any person** found]{.mark} at [sea
in **danger**]{.mark} of **[being lost]{.mark}** and, second, coastal
States to 'promote the establishment, operation and maintenance of an
adequate and effective \[maritime\] search and rescue service'.74
Additionally, the SOLAS Convention and International Convention on
Maritime Search]{.underline} and Rescue set forth the details of coastal
States' obligations concerning maritime search and rescue.75

Relevantly for the present purposes, [the **[duty]{.mark}** to [render
**assistance**]{.mark} seems to **[apply both]{.mark}** to
**[ONPPs]{.mark}** and in **[relation]{.mark}** to [**ONPPs** in
**distress**]{.mark}. Corresponding to the reference in Article 98 of
the LOSC to 'any person in danger of being lost',76 the [SOLAS]{.mark}
Convention [makes it **explicit**]{.mark} that the duty to render
[assistance '**applies regardless**]{.mark} of the
**[nationality]{.mark}** or status of such persons or the
**[circumstances]{.mark}** in which they are found'.77 Consequently,
[masters]{.mark} of ships may, by way of flag State jurisdiction,
[be]{.mark} [required]{.mark} to provide **[assistance]{.mark}** to an
**[ONPP]{.mark}** in **[distress]{.mark}** at sea]{.underline}. However,
it needs to be noted that this duty of shipmasters to render assistance
makes leeway for the safety of the assisting ship. [A ship without
practical capabilities to assist or that can only do so with great
dangers for the safety of the ship itself may thus be exempted from this
requirement]{.underline}.78 Because of the special hazards inherent to
nuclear facilities, this caveat seems especially relevant in relation to
ONPPs.

Although there is a rebirth of interest in nuclear energy, there is
still a basic problem: [[uranium is]{.mark} a mineral resource that
exists in **[finite]{.mark} amounts**]{.underline}.

Even [as early as the 1950s it was clear that the known [uranium]{.mark}
resources [were **not sufficient** to fuel]{.mark} the **["atomic
age"]{.mark}**]{.underline} for a period longer than a few decades.

[That gave rise to the idea of **"breeding" fissile plutonium**
fuel]{.underline} from the more abundant, non-fissile isotope 238 of
uranium. It was a very ambitious idea: fuel the industrial system with
an element that doesn't exist in measurable amounts on Earth but would
be created by humans expressly for their own purposes. The concept gave
rise to dreams of a plutonium-based economy. [This [**ambitious plan**
was never]{.mark} really [put into practice]{.mark}]{.underline},
though, at least not in the form that was envisioned in the 1950s and
'60s. Several attempts were made to build breeder reactors in the 1970s,
but the technology was found to be expensive, difficult to manage, and
prone to failure. Besides, it posed unsolvable strategic problems in
terms of the proliferation of fissile materials that could be used to
build atomic weapons. The idea was thoroughly abandoned in the 1970s,
when the US Senate enacted a law that forbade the reprocessing of spent
nuclear fuel.

[A **similar fate** was encountered by another idea that involved
"breeding" a nuclear fuel from a naturally existing
element---**thorium**]{.underline}. The concept involved transforming
the 232 isotope of thorium into the fissile 233 isotope of uranium,
which then could be used as fuel for a nuclear reactor (or for nuclear
warheads). 48 The idea was discussed at length during the heydays of the
nuclear industry, and it is still discussed today; but so far,
[**nothing has come out** of it]{.underline} and the nuclear industry is
still based on mineral uranium as fuel.

Today, [the production of uranium from mines is **insufficient** to
**fuel the existing nuclear reactors**]{.underline}. [The [gap between
supply and demand]{.mark} for mineral uranium has
[been]{.mark}]{.underline} as large as almost
**[[50%]{.underline}]{.mark}** from 1995 to 2005, though gradually
reduced the past few years.

[The U.S. mined **370,000 metric tons**]{.underline} the past 50 years,
[**peaking in 1981** at 17,000 tons/year]{.underline}.  [Europe **peaked
in the 1990s** after extracting **460,000 tons**.]{.underline} 
[Today]{.underline} nearly [all of the **21,000 ton/year** needed to
keep European nuclear plants operating is **imported**]{.underline}.

![The European mining cycle allows us to determine how much of the
originally estimated uranium reserves could be extracted versus what
actually happened before it cost too much to continue. Remarkably in all
countries where mining has stopped it did so at well below initial
estimates (50 to 70%). Therefore it's likely ultimate production in
South Africa and the United States can be predicted as
well.](media/image2.jpeg){width="6.165136701662292in"
height="1.5675699912510936in"}

The Soviet Union and Canada each mined 450,000 tons. By 2010 [**global
cumulative [production]{.mark}** [was **2.5 million
tons**]{.mark}]{.underline}.  Of this, [**[2 million]{.mark} tons** [has
been used]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [and the **military**
had]{.underline}]{.mark} [most of the [remaining]{.mark}]{.underline}
half a million tons.

The most recent data available show that mineral uranium accounts now
for about 80% of the demand.  The gap is filled by uranium recovered
from the stockpiles of the military industry and from the dismantling of
old nuclear warheads.

This [[turning]{.mark} of [**swords** into **plows** is]{.mark} surely
[a **good idea**, but **old nuclear weapons** and **military stocks**
are a **finite resource** and cannot be]{.mark} seen as [a **definitive
solution**]{.mark} to]{.underline} the problem of [**insufficient**
supply]{.underline}. With the present stasis in uranium demand, it is
possible that the production gap will be closed in a decade or so by
increased mineral production. However, prospects are uncertain, as
explained in "The End of Cheap Uranium." In particular, [[if
nuclear]{.mark} energy were to [see a **worldwide**]{.mark}
**expansion**, [it is **hard** to see]{.mark} how mineral
[production]{.mark} could [satisfy]{.mark} the increasing uranium
[demand]{.mark}]{.underline}, given the gigantic investments that would
be needed, [[which are unlikely]{.mark} to be possible
[in]{.mark}]{.underline} the present **[[economically challenging
times]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

At the same time, the effects of the 2011 incident at the Fukushima
nuclear power plant are likely to negatively affect the prospects of
growth for nuclear energy production, and with the concomitant reduced
demand for uranium, the surviving reactors may have sufficient fuel to
remain in operation for several decades.

It's true that there are large quantities of uranium in the Earth's
crust, but [[there are **limited**]{.mark} **numbers of
[deposits]{.mark}** [that are]{.mark} concentrated enough to be
**profitably [mined]{.mark}**]{.underline}. If we tried to extract those
less concentrated deposits, [the mining [process]{.mark} would require
far more energy than the mined uranium could ultimately
[produced]{.mark}]{.underline} [\[**[negative
EROI]{.underline}**\].]{.mark}

Modeling Future Uranium Supplies

**\<\<Table Omitted\>\>**

Michael Dittmar used historical data for countries and single mines, to
create a model that projected how much uranium will likely be extracted
from existing reserves in the years to come. The model is purely
empirical and is based on the assumption that mining companies, when
planning the extraction profile of a deposit, project their operations
to coincide with the average lifetime of the expensive equipment and
infrastructure it takes to mine uranium---about a decade.

Gradually the [extraction becomes **more expensive** as some equipment
has to be **replaced** and the least costly resources are
mined]{.underline}. [As a consequence, both **[extraction and profits
decline]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Eventually the company stops exploiting
the deposit and the **mine closes**]{.underline}. The model depends on
both geological and economic constraints, but the fact that it has
turned out to be valid for so many past cases shows that it is a good
approximation of reality.

This said, the model assumes the following points:

- Mine operators plan to operate the mine at a nearly constant
  production level on the basis of detailed geological studies and to
  manage extraction so that the plateau can be sustained for
  approximately 10 years.

- The total amount of extractable uranium is approximately the achieved
  (or planned) annual plateau value multiplied by 10.

Applying this model to well-documented mines in Canada and Australia, we
arrive at amazingly correct results. For instance, in one case, the
model predicted a total production of 319 ± 24 kilotons, which was very
close to the 310 kilotons actually produced. So we can be reasonably
confident that it can be applied to today's larger currently operating
and planned uranium mines. Considering that the achieved plateau
production from past operations was usually smaller than the one
planned, this model probably overestimates the future production.

Table 2 summarizes the model's predictions for future uranium
production, comparing those findings against forecasts from other groups
and against two different potential future nuclear scenarios.

As you can see, the [forecasts obtained]{.underline} by this model
[indicate **substantial supply constraints** in the coming
decades]{.underline}---a considerably different picture from that
presented by the other models, which predict larger supplies.

[The **WNA's 2009 forecast**]{.underline} differs from our model mainly
by assuming that existing and future mines will have a lifetime of at
least 20 years. As a result, the WNA predicts a production peak of 85
kilotons/year around the year 2025, about 10 years later than in the
present model, followed by a steep decline to about 70 kilotons/year in
2030. Despite being relatively optimistic, the forecast by the WNA shows
that the uranium production in 2030 would not be higher than it is
now. In any case, the long deposit lifetime in the WNA model is
inconsistent with the data from past uranium mines. The 2006 estimate
from the EWG was based on the Red Book 2005 RAR (reasonably assured
resources) and IR (inferred resources) numbers. The EWG calculated an
upper production limit based on the assumption that extraction can be
increased according to demand until half of the RAR or at most half of
the sum of the RAR and IR resources are used. That led the group to
[estimate a [production **peak** around]{.mark} the year
**[2025]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Assuming all]{.underline} planned [uranium mines are opened, annual
mining will increase from **54,000 tons/year to a maximum of
58**]{.underline} (+ or -- 4) thousand tons/year in 2015. \[ Bardi wrote
this before 2013 and 2014 figures were known. 2013 was 59,673 (highest
total) and 56,252 in 2014.\]

[[Declining]{.mark} uranium [production will make it **impossible** to
obtain]{.mark} a **significant [increase in]{.mark} electrical
[power]{.mark}** from nuclear plants]{.underline} in the coming decades.

5.1 Strengthen the Basic Theoretical System Construction of Nuclear
Accident Emergency Response

With the proposal of the national nuclear security concept, the
construction of nuclear emergency forces at the national level is
gradually accelerating. [Taking China\'s **nuclear** emergency
**response force**]{.underline} as an example, [the **[talent
shortage]{.mark}** has become a core issue **[restrict]{.mark}ing** the
[construction of **effective** **nuclear forces**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Under this background, some domestic colleges and universities have
added relevant courses, hoping to at the forefront in the construction
and training of nuclear professionals. However, [the [**concrete goals**
of]{.mark} **talent [training]{.mark}** [are]{.mark} still
**[unclear]{.mark}**, it is not clear from which aspects to train, the
core [problem is]{.mark} the **[weak]{.mark}** basic **[theoretical
system]{.mark}** of nuclear emergency]{.underline}. The basic
theoretical system is formed from the perspectives of management, law,
economics, and education, make what students should learn clear, in this
way, we can effectively guide the subsequent curriculum and research
direction setting, and thus serving talent training.

5.2 Improving Nuclear Accident Emergency Response Mechanism, Laws and
Regulations from the Basic Theoretical System

Although the nuclear accident emergency response points to the nuclear
accident field, the top-down management mechanism, operation mode, and
division of authority and responsibility conform to the operation laws
of management, law, and environmental protection. China\'s [national
[conditions **differ** greatly]{.mark} from those of the United
States]{.underline}, [and [it is **not scientific** to **copy**]{.mark}
the [mechanisms and laws]{.mark} of the **U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline}, therefore, the strength of experts in various
fields such as environmental protection, law and finance should be
absorbed to form the professional committee, after the basic theory is
perfected, through the fusion of big data, artificial intelligence and
other high-tech, coupled with mathematical modeling, military chess
deduction and other simulation methods, the long-term mechanism is
formed in the classification of nuclear weapon accidents, the
improvement of response mechanisms, the classification of personnel
involved, the management of financial operations, etc., then the basic
theory research is fed back through combat exercise and other ways,
after practical application and theoretical iterations, the rich and
perfect national mechanism and laws and regulations of nuclear emergency
response are finally formed.

5.3 Training Nuclear Emergency Response Forces with Actual Combat
Requirements

According to the number and location of nuclear weapon accidents in the
United States, we can see that the United States itself is not afraid of
nuclear weapon accidents, and it is obvious that military needs have a
higher priority than safety management, it may also be the reason for
frequent nuclear weapon accidents in the United States, multiple
emergency combat experiences have guided the United States to form more
scientific and efficient emergency response mechanisms, and laws and
regulations. At present, the [nuclear accident emergency
[training]{.mark} in China [is]{.mark} mainly **[imaginary]{.mark}**
accidents]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} emergency training is mainly
**personnel running**, **process** development and **equipment**
training, [**lack** real]{.mark} nuclear [**accident environment** and
**scenarios**]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the national level, the real
accident scenario simulation mechanism should be established, make the
national nuclear emergency response force, especially the nuclear weapon
accident response force, carry out emergency response training in a real
environment, train the team in the process of actual combat, and ensure
that China\'s nuclear emergency response force can carry out emergency
response calmly when the real nuclear accidents occur.

insists on taking the dangerous step, [[it will **surely**]{.mark}
**pay** [the **price**]{.mark} for its [irresponsible behavior]{.mark}

how **[China]{.mark}** will [affix]{.mark} the legal responsibility for
Fukushima nuclear wastewater discharge into the sea attracts [worldwide

[[Japan\'s discharge]{.mark} of Fukushima nuclear wastewater into the
sea will have a **[profound]{.mark}** and [**far-reaching impact**
on]{.mark} the **[marine environment]{.mark}** and human]{.underline}
health. Radioactive elements in nuclear wastewater cause long-term
radiological hazards, which may induce diseases and genetic mutations.
After the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (NPP),
[**[radionuclides]{.mark}** (such as 131I and 134Cs) from this source
were **[detected]{.mark}** in the atmosphere of most Chinese cities and
provinces]{.underline} \[5\]. Also, the State Oceanic Administration of
China [monitored the radioactivity in the marine environment of the West
Pacific waters east of Japan three months after the Fukushima Nuclear
Power Plant\'s leakage]{.underline}. According to monitoring results,
[radionuclides were detected in seawater samples, and 94% of samples in
the monitoring station contained 134Cs, [which **didn\'t**]{.mark} exist
[in **normal**]{.mark} **[circumstances]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Besides,
the content of 137Cs in 71% of monitoring stations exceeded the
background range of the Chinese sea area, and the content of 137Cs and
90Sr was 300 and 10 times that of the background range of the Chinese
sea area \[6\].

[The risk assessment is based on the above scientific evidence to make a

**[[economic]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[impacts]{.underline}]{.mark}**
on all aspects, which are mainly [[reflected in
**infringements**]{.mark} upon the right to a healthy
**[environment]{.mark}**, the right to **[development]{.mark}**, and the
**[property right]{.mark}**]{.underline}. On October 8, 2021, [the right
to a healthy environment was officially recognized by the **[UN\'s Human
Right]{.mark}** Council as a basic human right]{.underline} \[8\].
Currently, more than 150 countries have issued laws to safeguard this
right \[8\]. [Fukushima nuclear wastewater contains several radioactive
elements that may **[damage]{.mark}** the **[environment]{.mark}** and
**[humans]{.mark}** and [gravely **impact ocean resources**]{.mark}.
Undoubtedly, this discharge act will severely infringe upon the
**[right]{.mark}** to a healthy **[environment]{.mark}**. The
environment is an ecological system shared by all humans. [Every
subject]{.mark} of environmental legal relations equally
**[enjoys]{.mark}** the **[right]{.mark}** to a [healthy]{.mark}
**[environment]{.mark}**, and no subject can damage other subjects\'
right to a healthy environment]{.underline}. Although Japan had access
to and utilized environmental resources, it discharged nuclear
wastewater after the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant accident and refused
to fulfill the obligation to protect the healthy environment. Its act
severely infringed on other countries\' or regions\' right to a healthy
environment.

[The right to **[development]{.mark}** is a **[human right]{.mark}**
that recognizes every human right for constant improvement of
well-being]{.underline}. The right was first recognized in 1981 in
Article 22 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\' Rights as a
definitive individual and collective right \[9\]. The right to
development was subsequently proclaimed by the United Nations in 1986 in
the "Declaration on the Right to Development," which was adopted by the
United Nations General Assembly resolution 41/128 \[10\]. [Japan\'s
discharge of Fukushima nuclear wastewater infringes on the right to
development of every country that may be affected]{.underline}. Firstly,
[[discharging nuclear wastewater]{.mark} into the sea will
**[damage]{.mark}** the right to development on the **[economic
development]{.mark}** level]{.underline}. It\'s because nuclear
pollution will thwart neighboring countries\' fisheries and limit the
economic development of coastal areas, [failing to guarantee the
affected developing and developed countries enjoy the same right to
environmental development]{.underline}. Secondly, [discharging nuclear
wastewater into the sea will damage the right to development on the
level of sustainable development]{.underline}. [[**Environmental
protection** is]{.mark} a **[critical]{.mark}** **[component]{.mark}**
of a country\'s development, and the irreversibility of nuclear
pollution will severely damage the virtuous cycle of environmental
protection and economic development]{.underline}.

The property right is also basic human right. [[Judged
by]{.underline}]{.mark} the economic impacts caused by the [**[Chornobyl
incident]{.mark}**, the economic factors for **[Japan\'s discharge
act]{.mark}** include but are not limited to the ocean product
**[industry]{.mark}**, **[tourism]{.mark}**, and the
**[catering]{.mark}** sector]{.underline}. Due to impaired functions of
soils in coastal regions, [citizens in polluted regions are forced to
move to other places]{.underline}, which may [[waste]{.mark} more
**[economic interests]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A year after the Fukushima
Nuclear Power Plant accident, the Japanese government announced a series
of standards for compensating citizens in the evacuation area of
Fukushima\'s No.1 Nuclear Power Plant. These standards [stipulated the
compensations for immovable properties, including land and houses, house
assets such as furniture and electrical appliances, and losses from
operations and salaries]{.underline} \[11\]. Furthermore, the Japanese
government and Tokyo Electric Power successively launched many legal
precedents concerning economic compensation for victims of the nuclear
accident. For example, the Japanese Yokohama District Court judged that
152 plaintiffs had the right to claim economic compensation in 2019,
including the compensation for economic losses of evacuating from
Fukushima Prefecture to Ehime Prefecture \[12[\]. The [relief
measures]{.mark} in Japan have fully [demonstrated]{.mark} the Fukushima
nuclear power plant incident\'s **[damage]{.mark}** to [citizens\'
right]{.mark} to **[property]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Nevertheless, the
Japanese government didn\'t respond to or formulate plans to compensate
for the economic losses other countries and regions suffered due to the
Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant accident and the discharge act.

[**[Japan]{.mark}** is a contracting [party]{.mark} to the United
Nations Convention on the Law [of]{.mark} the Sea
(**[UNCLOS]{.mark}**)]{.underline}. According to Articles 192 and 194 in
the UNCLOS, [Japan has an **[obligation]{.mark}** to
**[protect]{.mark}** and preserve the [marine **environment**]{.mark}
and shall take all measures consistent with this Convention to prevent,
reduce, and control pollution]{.underline}. Besides, it shall take all
measures to ensure domestic environmental pollution incidents do not
cause damage by pollution to other states or spread beyond the areas
where it exercises its sovereign rights. [Considering the discharge of
nuclear wastewater into the sea will increase the risk of polluting the
marine environment, Japan should "observe, measure, evaluate and
analyze, by [recognized]{.mark} scientific methods, [the
**risks**]{.mark} or effects of **[pollution]{.mark}** of the marine
environment"]{.underline}, publish a report on environmental impact
assessment, and notify the discharge plan and its environmental impact
assessment report to IAEA (International Atomic Energy) and all
countries that may be affected in advance \[13\]. In Pulp Mills on the
River Uruguay Case,1 the International Court of Justice (ICJ) creatively
proposed environmental impact assessments. The ICJ held that
environmental impact assessments should be conducted if industrial
activities have severe adverse impacts on the cross-border environment
and resource sharing. Therefore, Japan should conduct adequate
environmental impact assessments before discharging nuclear wastewater
and report evaluation results to stakeholders. Nevertheless, Japan
hasn\'t fulfilled the procedural obligations stipulated in the
Convention. Since the Japanese government\'s decision-making procedures
for discharging nuclear wastewater into the sea lack openness,
transparency and democracy, the Japanese government is suspected of
violating the procedural obligation stipulated by the UNCLOS.

The illegality of Japan\'s act to discharge Fukushima nuclear wastewater
into the sea can be analyzed from two perspectives. For one thing,
Article 194 of the UNCLOS stipulates that Japan has an obligation to
take all necessary measures to prevent, reduce, and control pollution in
the marine environment. Whether there is a more proper alternative plan
is the criterion for judging whether Japan "individually or jointly as
appropriate, all measures consistent with UNCLOS". There are five
disposition paths considered by the Government (ground injection,
controlled discharge into the sea, discharge as steam, discharge as
hydrogen, and solidification for underground burial) \[14\]. In the
Southern Bluefin Tuna Cases,2 the International Tribunal for the Law of
the Sea (ITLOS), under the propositions of Australia and New Zealand
(the applicants), ordered Japan to terminate its plan for the
experimental catch of southern bluefin tunas. This case\'s significance
is the Tribunal restricted cross-border fishery in the precautionary
principle, which enhances the stipulations and spirit of the Rio
Declaration 1992 to some extent.3 Regarding Japan\'s nuclear wastewater
discharge, there is inadequate full scientific certainty to prove the
hazards of discharging before and after the discharge act. Hence
cost-effective measures can be taken to prevent environmental
degradation.

However, the Japanese government insists on selecting the plan of
discharging nuclear wastewater into the sea, which considerably
increases the risks of severe damage to the global marine environment.
It is sufficient to prove that the Japanese government didn\'t "take all
measures consistent with UNCLOS" to avoid pollution to the marine
environment. Therefore, the act to discharge Fukushima nuclear
wastewater into the sea violates the UNCLOS and the basic legal
principle of international radiation prevention. For another, the future
act to discharge should meet existing standards for safe discharge.
Currently, the international standards for the safe discharge of nuclear
wastewater can be determined based on the UNCLOS and the Convention on
the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter
1972 (London Convention). According to Article 207 of the UNCLOS,
"States shall adopt laws and regulations to prevent, reduce and control
pollution of the marine environment from land-based sources ... taking
into account internationally agreed rules, standards and recommended
practices and procedures." This has been recognized by relevant
international conventions. For example, the London Convention stipulates
the wastes allowed to be dumped and their lowest exempted
concentrations. Japan\'s future discharge of nuclear wastewater in the
sea may result in two circumstances. Firstly, the activity concentration
of radionuclides is higher than the safety discharge criteria stipulated
by domestic laws and the IAEA, so it\'s inevitably against the laws.
Secondly, the activity concentration of radionuclides is lower than
relevant safe discharge criteria, and the Japanese government should
confirm it by checking the oversight mechanism on the prerequisites of
openness, transparency, and democracy. In addition, the Japanese
government should timely update the implementation of the plan for
discharging nuclear wastewater into the sea, the report on environmental
impact assessment, and emergency preparation plans. Otherwise, it
remains an unlawful act.

[**[All parties]{.mark}** in the [international]{.mark} community should
**[cooperate]{.mark}** before [damaging behaviors occur]{.mark}. It\'s
an integral component of the principle for [**international**
cooperation]{.mark}, the precise application of the risk prevention
principle, and the **[best annotation]{.mark}** of
**[protecting]{.mark}** the ecological **[environment]{.mark}** in the
case of Japan\'s **discharge** of nuclear wastewater into the
sea]{.underline}. The compensation and remedy for damage after the
damaging act occurs are based on the legal responsibility that Japan
should undertake when its international unlawful act causes
transnational personal, asset, and environmental damage. According to
Japanese domestic laws and Article 44 of the Law of the People\'s
Republic of China on Choice of Law for Foreign-related Civil
Relationships, [**[Chinese victims]{.mark}** have the **[right]{.mark}**
to launch **[lawsuits]{.mark}** to claim **[infringement
damage]{.mark}** compensations in **[Japanese]{.mark}** or Chinese
courts]{.underline}. Besides, [Japanese and Chinese domestic laws can be
used as the proper laws for hearing disputes over compensation for
environmental damage caused by Fukushima wastewater
discharge]{.underline}.

Jan Haverkamp, Greenpeace Netherlands [senior [expert]{.mark}
**[nuclear]{.mark} [energy]{.mark}**]{.underline} and energy
policy, [[sees]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[three]{.underline}]{.mark}**
main **[[disadvantages]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of]{.underline}
**[Akademin Lomonosov]{.underline}** to be the [big human factors
risk]{.underline}, its **[problematic]{.underline}**
[construction]{.underline}, and the [**pollution** of the Arctic
region]{.underline} with **[nuclear waste]{.underline}**.

To start with, [Haverkamp]{.underline} [points]{.underline}
[out]{.underline} that the **[[remote area]{.underline}]{.mark}** where
the nuclear reactor is situated [[requires]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[**great** **amount** of **[people]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[braving]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[weather conditions]{.mark} to get
there]{.underline}.

"It's already a [challenge]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [keep workers
motivated]{.underline} and satisfied while [working]{.underline}
[at]{.underline} nuclear [power]{.underline} [stations]{.underline}
[on]{.underline} remote [locations]{.underline}, but [easy to
reach]{.underline} by airplane or a train connection," he says, pointing
out that **[[travelling]{.underline}]{.mark}** to Russia's Far East on a
daily basis [[increases]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[risk
factor]{.underline}]{.mark}** to a level "comparable to the risk of
human factors in the military."

Along with that, [[if something goes wrong]{.underline}]{.mark}, it is
[very]{.underline} **[[difficult]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[to]{.underline} **[get]{.underline}** **[there]{.underline}**]{.mark}
and rectify things, "way more difficult than it was in Fukushima to send
the air fire brigade cars with an earthquake having destroyed the
infrastructure," says Haverkamp.

He also points out that it [[poses]{.underline} [a]{.underline}
**[safety risk]{.underline}**]{.mark} because [in]{.underline}
[order]{.underline} [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} [[be]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**[light]{.mark}** [enough]{.mark} [so it stays
**floating**]{.mark}]{.underline}, some of the [safety
features]{.underline} usually present on a land-based reactor [have to
be **taken out**]{.underline}.

"There [**cannot** be as much]{.underline} [end-of-the-pipe technology
[to **reduce** safety risks]{.mark}]{.underline} and there
[[cannot]{.underline}]{.mark} [[be]{.underline} [a]{.underline}
**[concrete]{.underline}**]{.mark} [**[dome]{.mark}** over
it]{.underline} [like]{.underline} we have over [land base nuclear power
stations]{.underline}," he adds, because that would increase the risk of
the barge sinking.

The third point Haverkamp reinforces is that although this nuclear
[reactor]{.underline} [might]{.underline} [seem]{.underline}
[more]{.underline} **[environmentally friendly]{.underline}** than
fossil fuels, the Akademik Lomonosov [[plan]{.underline}
[includes]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[reactor]{.mark}
**[staying]{.mark}** [at]{.mark}]{.underline} [[sea for **12
years**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

"This means [fuel]{.underline} [has to be changed about four
times]{.underline}, in this time the **[[used
fuel]{.underline}]{.mark}** which [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[highly]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [highly]{.underline}
**[[toxic]{.underline}]{.mark}** [will]{.underline} **[[remain
onboard]{.underline}]{.mark}** before being shipped off and replaced
with fresh fuel," Haverkamp says.

This leads to a [[major **environmental concern**]{.underline}]{.mark}
Greenpeace takes into consideration -- the fact that this
[project]{.underline} is **[[reintroducing]{.underline}]{.mark}** a
[[major **pollution risk**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[in an area which
functions as]{.underline} [a]{.underline}
**[climate]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[regulator]{.underline}]{.mark}**
for the globe -- "the Arctic pristine area, which is a very important
natural area for the entire balance on the planet," Haverkamp concludes.

#### It's a catastrophe waiting to happen.

**Haverkamp '18** -- Jan Haverkamp is a nuclear energy and energy policy
consultant with Greenpeace Central and Eastern Europe. (May 2, 2018, \"5
reasons why a floating nuclear power plant in the Arctic is a terrible
idea\",

soyam)

We already know the risks of drilling for oil in such a wild and fragile
region, but a [[floating]{.mark} [nuclear reactor]{.mark}]{.underline}
could be even worse. Here's why:

1\. It's **[a [catastrophe]{.mark} [waiting]{.mark} to
happen]{.underline}**

[Nuclear [reactors]{.mark} bobbing [around]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
[Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} Ocean [[pose]{.underline}]{.mark} a
shockingly **[[obvious]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[threat]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} this
[wild]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [**[fragile]{.mark}**
[environment]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Rosatom has said that the [plant]{.underline} "[is]{.underline}
[[designed]{.underline} [with]{.underline}]{.mark} the \[sic\]
[[**great** **margin** of safety]{.underline}]{.mark} that exceeds all
possible threats and [makes]{.underline} nuclear [reactors]{.underline}
**[invincible]{.underline}** for tsunamis and other natural disasters."
[[Remember]{.underline}]{.mark} [the]{.underline} [[**last time** a ship
was called]{.mark} '**[unsinkable]{.mark}'**?]{.underline}

[Nothing]{.underline} [is]{.underline} [invincible]{.underline}. The
problem is that this **[[nuclear titanic]{.underline}]{.mark}** has been
constructed without any independent experts checking it. In Chornobyl,
there was a similar lack of oversight.

This plant's flat-bottomed hull makes it particularly vulnerable to
tsunamis and cyclones. A large wave can pitch the power station onto the
coast. It also [[**can't** move by itself]{.underline}]{.mark}. [If it
[comes]{.mark} **[loose]{.mark}**]{.underline} from its moorings, [it
[can't]{.mark} **[move]{.mark} [away]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} a
[threat]{.mark}]{.underline} (an iceberg or a foreign vessel, for
example) [increasing]{.underline} the **[[risk]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[[deadly]{.mark} incident]{.underline}**.
A **[[collision]{.underline}]{.mark}** could
**[[damage]{.underline}]{.mark}** its [vital **[functions]{.mark}** and
lead to a **loss of power**]{.underline} and
[[damage]{.underline}]{.mark} its [[cooling
function]{.underline}]{.mark}, and that could [lead to a
**[release]{.mark}** of [radioactive]{.mark}
[substances]{.mark}]{.underline} **[into the environment]{.underline}**.
 

2\. Imagine how hard it will be to deal with the consequences

There are [so many things that could go wrong here]{.underline}: it
could **[[flood]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [or
**[sink]{.mark},**]{.underline} [or [**run**
**aground**]{.mark}]{.underline}. All of these scenarios could
potentially [lead]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [radioactive substances
being **leaked into the environment**]{.underline}.

In the case of a collapse, the [core will be cooled by the surrounding
seawater]{.underline}. While this seems like a good idea, when melting
fuel rods come into with seawater, it will first [lead to a
[**seawater** **explosion**]{.mark}]{.underline} and potential
[**hydrogen** explosions]{.underline} that will [spread]{.underline} a
large amount of [**radioactive** **isotopes** into the
**atmosphere**.]{.underline}

A [damaged reactor]{.underline} could [contaminate]{.underline} much of
the [marine wildlife in the near vicinity]{.underline}. That means that
[**[fish stocks]{.mark}** could be **[contaminated]{.mark}** for years
to come]{.underline}. A [[radioactive Arctic]{.mark} is **not** a
**pretty** scenario]{.underline}. The areas around Fukushima and
Chornobyl are already difficult to clean up; imagine the polar night,
deep sub-zero temperatures and Arctic storms.

3\. The terrible track record of nuclear ships, icebreakers and
submarines  

There is very [very [long list of **incidents**]{.mark} and
**[accidents]{.mark}** with existing nuclear submarines and
icebreakers.]{.underline}

The very first nuclear icebreaker, Lenin, had a cooling accident in
1965, resulting in a partial meltdown of the core. The damaged
radioactive core was dumped in the Tsivolki Bay near the Novaya Zemlya
archipelago in 1967. In 1970 the reactor of a nuclear submarine (K-320)
started up by itself at Krasnoye Sormovo wharf in Russia, releasing
large amounts of radiation and causing hundreds of people to be exposed.
An accident during fuel loading of the reactor of a nuclear submarine in
Chazma in 1985 irradiated 290 workers leading to 10 casualties and 49
people injured. The list goes on...

Rosatom's plans to build a fleet of floating nuclear power stations
means an unprecedented increase of the risk of nuclear incidents and
accidents in the Arctic.

4\. A nuclear dumping ground on water

[[We]{.mark} [already]{.mark} [have]{.mark} **more** **[nuclear
waste]{.mark}** than we know what to do with. [We]{.mark}
**[don't]{.mark}** [need]{.mark} any **[more]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

The reactors on this plant are smaller than conventional land based
nuclear plants and [will need **[refuelling]{.mark}** [every]{.mark}
[two]{.mark} to three [years]{.mark}]{.underline}. The nuclear waste
will be stored onboard until it returns after 12 designated years of
operation. That means that [[radioactive]{.mark} [waste]{.mark} will be
[left]{.mark} **[floating]{.mark}** around [in the Arctic for years at a
time]{.mark}.  ]{.underline}

Not [only is this **[incredibly risky]{.mark}**]{.underline}, there is
[still **nowhere secure** for]{.underline} the [spent fuel to be
**transported**]{.underline} to once it's on land. No power source
should create waste that takes milennia to be safe.

#### [Overlapping]{.underline} jurisdictions and technical [uncertainties]{.underline} deck aff [solvency]{.underline}.

**Wellock '21** --Thomas Wellock is an NRC Historian. (September 24,
2021, \"Floating Nuclear Power Plants: **[Waves of
Uncertainty]{.underline}**: (Part II)\",
https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/students/history-101/waves-of-uncertainty.html,
soyam)

Offshore Power Systems, apparently, did not appreciate that putting
land-based reactors out to sea was bound to raise new safety,
environmental and regulatory questions.
**[[Concerns]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[about]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**[ship]{.underline}** **[collisions]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [off-shore
fishing grounds]{.underline}, [[**barge** **sinking**]{.mark} and the
[challenge]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [creating a **new** **regulatory**
**process** for floating reactors]{.mark}]{.underline} were just some of
the unique issues facing regulators.

Even the trade press raised concerns. Nuclear News worried about the
\"[incredibly **[tangled]{.mark}** **[mass]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
**[overlapping]{.mark}** **[jurisdictions]{.mark}**, **[state]{.mark}**,
**[national]{.mark}**, and **[international]{.mark}** [law]{.mark},
inter-agency **[authority]{.mark}**]{.underline}\" that included new
players such as the U.S. Coast Guard.

Events conspired to worsen OPS\'s prospects. The oil crisis that began
in 1973 made construction financing expensive and slowed electricity
consumption. Facing slack demand, PSEG postponed delivery of the first
floating plant from 1981 to 1985 and later to 1988. Tenneco backed out
of the OPS partnership in 1975. With the entire enterprise threatened,
Westinghouse and the Florida Congressional delegation asked the federal
government to purchase four plants. But, the prospect of \"bailing out\"
OPS did not appeal to officials in the Ford Administration. The purchase
proposal died.

[[Floating reactors **did not solve**]{.mark} regulatory or **[political
problems]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The production facility in Jacksonville
needed an NRC manufacturing license. There were so many
**[technical]{.underline}** and [[regulatory]{.mark}
**[uncertainties]{.mark}**]{.underline} that the [**[licensing]{.mark}**
**[review]{.mark}** ran **[three]{.mark}** **[years]{.mark}** [behind
schedule]{.mark}]{.underline}. A 1978 report from the U.S. General
Accounting Office criticized the NRC for what it believed was an
incomplete safety review, particularly for not accounting for impacts on
the ocean ecosystem during an accident where a melting reactor core
broke through the bottom of the barge.

**[[Local]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[state]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[opposition]{.underline}]{.mark} to
the plant was **[[intense]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Nearby counties voted
in non-binding referendums 2 to 1 against the Atlantic Generating
Station, and the New Jersey legislature refused to introduce a bill to
turn the offshore site over to PSEG.

[All nuclear **[reactors]{.mark}** in **history** have [take]{.mark}n
**10 to 22 years**]{.underline} [from]{.underline} the
[planning]{.underline} phase [to operation]{.underline} (2). Recently,
[the range has **increased**]{.underline} [to **17 to [22
years]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} North [America]{.mark} and
Europe]{.underline} (2). According to the World Health Organization,
about 7.4 million people die from outdoor plus indoor air pollution each
year, with more than 90 percent of these deaths from energy-related
combustion (3). So, switching the world's energy to nuclear would result
in at least 113 million people dying as we wait at least 17 years for
all the new nuclear reactors to be built in an all-nuclear scenario.

On top of that, [[as we wait until **2041**]{.underline}]{.mark} (17
years) [[for]{.mark} **even [a single new reactor]{.mark}** to
operate]{.underline}, global
**[[temp]{.underline}]{.mark}**erature[**[s]{.mark}** [will accelerate
**beyond 1.5**]{.mark}]{.underline}° C above the 1850-1900 average. The
1.5° C threshold is considered dangerous for the planet by the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (4). Based on the remaining
carbon budget, 80% of the [chemicals that cause warming must be
eliminated **by 2030**]{.underline} and 100% by 2035-2050 to avoid 1.5°
C (5). As such, [new nuclear is **not useful at all** for solving the
climate]{.underline} and air pollution problems we face.

Utility-scale [[**wind** and **solar**]{.underline}]{.mark} farms, [on
the other hand, take]{.underline} an average of **[only
one]{.underline}** to five **[year]{.underline}**s from planning to
operation. [Rooftop]{.underline} solar PV [projects [are down to]{.mark}
only [a **six-month** timeline]{.mark}]{.underline}. So, transitioning
to 100% clean, renewable energy for all purposes as soon as possible
would result in tens of millions fewer deaths than a nuclear scenario,
and may also avoid 1.5° C warming.

This illustrates a major problem with nuclear energy and why renewable
energy \-- in particular Wind, Water, and Solar (WWS)\-- avoids this
problem. Nuclear, though, doesn't have just one problem. It has seven.
Here are the seven major problems with nuclear energy:

1\. Long Time Lag Between Planning and Operation

[[The **time lag**]{.underline}]{.mark} [between planning and
operation]{.underline} of a nuclear reactor [[includes the times to
**identify a site**,]{.mark} obtain a site **permit**]{.underline},
**[[purchase]{.underline}]{.mark}** [or lease the [land]{.mark}, obtain
a **construction** permit]{.underline}, [obtain
**financing**]{.underline} [and **insurance**]{.underline} for
construction, [install transmission, negotiate a power
purchase]{.underline} agreement, obtain permits, **[[build the
reactor]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [connect it to transmission, [and obtain
a]{.mark} final operating [license]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The]{.underline} planning-to-operation (**[PTO]{.underline}**)
**[times]{.underline}** of all nuclear reactors ever built [have been
10-22 years]{.underline}. For example, the Olkiluoto 3 reactor in
Finland was proposed to the Finnish cabinet in December 2000 to be added
to an existing nuclear reactor. It began generating electricity in 2022,
giving it a PTO time of 22 years.

The Hinkley Point C nuclear reactor was planned in 2008. It has an
estimated completion year of 2028, giving it a PTO time of 20 years.

The Vogtle 3 and 4 reactors in the U.S. state of Georgia were first
proposed in August 2006 to be added to an existing site. Vogtle 3 was
connected to the grid in 2023 and Vogtle 4 is expected to be connected
in 2024, giving them PTO times of 17 and 18 years, respectively.

The Flamanville, France, Unit 3 reactor was planned in 2004. The reactor
is expected to be completed in 2024, for a PTO time of 20 years.

The Haiyang 1 and 2 reactors in China were planned to start in 2005.
Haiyang 1 began commercial operation on October 22, 2018. Haiyang 2
began operation on January 9, 2019, giving them PTO times of 13 and 14
years, respectively.

The Taishan 1 and 2 reactors in China were bid in 2006. They began
commercial operation in 2018 and 2019, respectively, giving them PTO
times of 12 and 13 years, respectively.

Planning and procurement for four reactors in Ringhals, Sweden started
in 1965. One took 10 years, the second took 11 years, the third took 16
years, and the fourth took 18 years to complete.

Many claim that France's 1974 Messmer plan resulted in the building of
its 58 reactors in 15 years. This is not true. The planning for several
of these nuclear reactors began long before. For example, the Fessenheim
reactor obtained its construction permit in 1967 and was planned
starting years before. In addition, 10 of the reactors were completed
between 1991-2000. As such, the whole planning-to-operation time for
these reactors was at least 32 years, not 15. That of any individual
reactor was 10 to 19 years.

**[[There is no ev]{.underline}]{.mark}**idence that small modular
reactors (**[[SMRs]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [[will reduce]{.mark} PTO
[times]{.mark}]{.underline} compared with large reactors. Indeed,
[[no]{.mark} commercialized [SMR **exists**]{.mark}
worldwide]{.underline}. [In the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, [[the **only** company building an
SMR]{.underline}]{.mark} with its design approved by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission [[**lost** its main
purchaser]{.underline}]{.mark}, lost 84% of the value of its stock from
its peak[, was **sued**]{.underline} by its shareholders
[for]{.underline} securities **[fraud]{.underline}**, [and laid off 28%
of its full-time staff]{.underline}, all near the end of 2023. [[Their
test reactor]{.mark}, if it will be built **at all**]{.underline}, [[is
not anticipated to be available until after
**2030**]{.underline}]{.mark}, far too late for it to be an effective
solution to air pollution or global warming.

### AT: Warming\-\--No Impact\-\--1NC

#### No warming impact---the [geological record]{.underline} proves survival. 

**Thorstad 23**, PhD, Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Vanderbilt
University. (David, 1-28-2023, \"Exaggerating the risks (Part 4:
Halstead continued),\" Reflective Altruism,
https://reflectivealtruism.com/2023/01/28/exaggerating-the-risks-part-4-halstead-continued/)

But I will bite. I think Halstead is quite convincing in arguing that
the paleoclimate [[**data** does not give]{.underline}]{.mark} us good
[[reason to expect climate change to bring about]{.underline}]{.mark}
irreversible **[existential [catastrophe]{.mark}]{.underline}** any time
soon, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} probably [[gives]{.mark} us [**good
reason** to expect]{.mark} that [it **won't**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The first thing to note is that [the earth has been **much
hotter**]{.underline} in the past [than even the most **dire** warming
projections]{.underline} predict it will soon become. [[During
the]{.underline}]{.mark} Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum
(**[[PETM]{.underline}]{.mark}**) 55 million years ago, [[the earth
was]{.underline}]{.mark} an astounding
14-**[[17°]{.underline}]{.mark}**C [**[above]{.mark}** the
pre-industrial average, but **species extinctions** were
**limited**]{.underline}. Here is Halstead:

Overall, in the PETM, temperatures were upwards of 17°C higher than
pre-industrial levels and [the **only species** that went
extinct]{.underline} that we know of [was]{.underline} a
**[single-celled]{.underline}** marine organism, and [on land it was a
time of **ecological flourishing**]{.underline}, persistence and
diversity.

But if the scorching temperatures of the PETM did not lead to
existential catastrophe, [why believe that lower levels of warming will
now **destroy humanity**]{.underline}? We saw in Part 2 that even Ord
seems concerned by this thought:

The best argument against ... unknown mechanisms \[for extinction\] is
probably that [[the PETM]{.underline}]{.mark} \[Paleocene--Eocene
Thermal Maximum\] [[did **not** lead to a mass extinction, despite
temp]{.underline}]{.mark}erature[[s **rapidly
rising**]{.underline}]{.mark} about 5 degrees Celsius, [to
reach]{.underline} a level of **[14 degrees]{.underline}** Celsius above
pre-industrial temperatures.

Toby Ord, The precipice

However, Ord suggests that even though the PETM was hotter than the 21st
century will be, warming during the PETM was slower than the rapid
warming we are now experiencing:

Most importantly, anthropogenic warming could be over a hundred times
faster than warming during the PETM, and rapid warming has been
suggested as a contributing factor in the end-Permian mass extinction,
in which 96 percent of species went extinct.

Toby Ord, The precipice

Fair enough. But Halstead has something to say about that too.

Citing Willis and MacDonald (2011), Halstead reminds us that [[we have
seen **rapid warming** before]{.underline}]{.mark}:

a\. [In **Greenland**]{.underline}, [temperatures]{.underline} may [have
risen]{.underline} by **[10°]{.underline}**C, though this may be an
error in climate proxies.

b\. [In [the **Swiss Alps**]{.mark}]{.underline} and other parts of
Europe, a [warming of]{.underline} 2 to **[5°]{.underline}**C [appears
to have occurred in 200 years or less]{.underline}.

c\. [In the **[Sierra Nevada]{.mark}**]{.underline} of California,
[rates of warming in the late glacial may have been]{.underline} 4 to
**[5°]{.underline}**C every 500 years [around 15,000 years
ago.]{.underline}

d\. At the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, [there were
increases of 5°C and more over a **few decades**]{.underline} (11,700
years ago).

e\. [Data from [**Greenland** ice cores]{.mark}
[suggest]{.mark}]{.underline} that a \>[**[10°]{.mark}**C
[warming]{.mark} may have [occurred over]{.mark}]{.underline} 20 to
**[[6 years]{.underline}]{.mark}** (13,000 to 11,000 years ago).

f\. In California, warming at the close of the Younger Dryas (13,000
years ago) may have been on the order of 3°C in less than 100 to 200
years.

g\. For the entire Southwest US, a general warming of 4°C may have
occurred in less than a century (13,000 to 11,000 years ago).

Halstead, Climate change and longtermism

Just as [[history gives us **abundant ev**]{.underline}]{.mark}idence
[[of]{.mark} large mammals [**surviving** temperatures
**hotter**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[than]{.mark} the earth is projected to
be]{.underline} by 2100, [history also gives us evidence of survival at
rates of warming comparable to the **[worst-case scenarios]{.mark}** in
the IPCC report]{.underline}.

[Even the worst-looking scenarios give **cause for
comfort**]{.underline}. For example, [[in]{.mark} the beginning of [the
**Holocene**]{.mark}]{.underline} (\~10,000 BCE), climate change did
seem to play a role in the extinction of megafauna (large animals). But
there is little evidence of plant extinctions, and many megafauna
survived. In particular, Halstead notes, [[humans]{.mark} **lived**,
and]{.underline} by all appearances **[[thrived]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[during this time]{.underline}. And as for the megafauna who perished, a
live scientific hypothesis is the overkill hypothesis: they died because
we killed and ate them. (Halstead assigns this 90% credence, but notes
that many scientists may be closer to 50%). All of this gives us every
reason for confidence that [[**today's** humans, with]{.mark} greater
numbers, **[tech]{.mark}**]{.underline}nology, [[and
**forewarning**]{.underline}]{.mark} than our ancestors, [[can
**survive**]{.mark} ongoing **climate catastrophe**.]{.underline}

We saw in Part 2 that the only sustained argument which Ord makes in
favor of climate risk is his discussion of unknown mechanisms in the
context of paleoclimate. But, if Halstead is right to suggest that the
paleoclimate data gives us every reason for confidence in humanity's
survival, then we should not have much confidence in Ord's argument.

### AT: Warming\-\--No Impact\-\--2NC

#### The impact is [marginal]{.underline}, [slow]{.underline}, and [buffered]{.underline} by tech and infrastructure.

**Nordhaus 24**, Founder and Executive Director @ The Breakthrough
Institute; BA @ UC Berkeley. (Ted, Winter 2024, "Did Exxon Make It Rain

Discussions of weather-related natural disasters in recent years have
largely focused on one particular human factor: the consequences of an
anthropogenically warming planet. But the heavy concentration of
catastrophic disasters prior to the period when climate change began to
significantly warm the planet should remind us that the [earth's climate
has always been **highly variable**, **extreme**, and
**dangerous**]{.underline}. What determines whether hurricanes, floods,
heat waves, and wildfires amount to natural disasters or minor
nuisances, though, is mostly not the relative intensity or frequency of
the natural hazard but rather how many people are in harm's way and how
well protected they are against the climate's extremes.

[**[Infrastructure]{.mark}**, institutions, [and
**tech**]{.mark}]{.underline}nology [[**mediate** the relationship
between]{.underline}]{.mark} extreme [[climate and
weather]{.underline}]{.mark} phenomena, [and the costs]{.underline} that
human [societies bear]{.underline} as a result of them.
[**[A]{.mark}**ir **[c]{.mark}**onditioning
[mitigates]{.mark}]{.underline} suffering during **[[heat]{.mark}
waves]{.underline}**. **[[Dams]{.underline}]{.mark}**, reservoirs, [and
**[flood control]{.mark}**]{.underline} systems [keep water from
inundating population centers]{.underline} during intense rainstorms.
[Building codes [and **hardened infrastructure** help]{.mark} the built
environment]{.underline} [[withstand]{.underline}]{.mark} hurricanes,
tornadoes, and other **[[extreme weather]{.underline}]{.mark}** events.
Multi-day **[forecasts]{.underline}**, **[[early
warning]{.underline}]{.mark}** systems, [[and **emergency
response**]{.underline}]{.mark} capabilities [[allow people to
**anticipate**]{.mark} climatic [extremes]{.mark}]{.underline}, prepare
for them, [[and **survive**]{.underline}]{.mark} them.

The implications of this point will be counterintuitive for many. Yes,
there are many types of disasters, like [hurricanes and
floods]{.underline}, that [are causing greater economic
costs]{.underline} in many places than they used to. But this is almost
**[entirely]{.underline}** [because]{.underline} the
[places]{.underline} that are most exposed to weather disasters
[have]{.underline} far more people and far [more **wealth** in harm's
way]{.underline} than they used to. Even if there were no global
warming, in other words, [these areas would be much more at risk simply
because they have much more to lose.]{.underline}

Once you factor out how many more people and how much more economic
activity are in exposed areas, the economic costliness of weather
extremes in recent decades has generally been flat or declining, not
rising. The human costs, meanwhile, measured by deaths associated with
climate and weather extremes, have fallen dramatically over the last
century. (See Figure 1, facing page.) Improving infrastructure and
technology have made most people much more resilient to climate hazards
today, even in relatively poor regions and even as the climate has
warmed.

Still, there has been no shortage of tragedies associated with extreme
weather events in recent decades. But where they do occur, it is almost
entirely due to failures of institutions and infrastructure, not the
additional extremity of the weather event due to climate change. Two
under-engineered and long-neglected dams in the divided country of
Libya, racked for years by civil war, fail, sending a torrent of flood
water into a large city and killing thousands. While Lahaina, Hawaii, is
ablaze,

Maui authorities fail to send out an evacuation warning and close the
main road out of the city, as fire hydrants run dry amid years-long
fights over water supply, resulting in a hundred avoidable deaths.
Katrina, a strong but not exceptional hurricane, makes landfall over New
Orleans, a city that sits mostly below sea level with a large low-income
population living in the shadow of levees that haven't been properly
built or maintained, killing well over a thousand.

These disasters were human-caused. But the human causes that turned
these extreme events into terrible disasters were failures of
infrastructure and institutions. Climate change was not the decisive
factor.

One would be hard-pressed to glean this crucial distinction from media
outlets like the New York Times, the Associated Press, and CNN.
Seemingly every day, we are bombarded by news of yet another extreme
weather event that is attributed to climate change. And while there is
evidence that climate change is influencing some of these events, the
role it is playing in most of them has been reliably exaggerated.

The consequences of this misattribution are significant. The capture of
the media by a catastrophist climate narrative has directed public
attention away from straightforward measures that policymakers can take
to reduce our vulnerability to the climate's extremes. It has allowed
politicians, in the wake of climate-related disasters, to divert
attention from their own failures by pointing the finger at fossil fuel
companies. It has amplified the claims of an increasingly unhinged
climate movement that has consistently polarized public sentiment on the
issue and undermined practical efforts to reduce emissions and
transition the world toward cleaner energy. And it has left many people
gripped by a terror about the future that solves nothing and isn't
justified to begin with.

In the media, the environmental advocacy community, and much of the
academy, the basic mental model for how climate change will impact human
societies is typified by the famous poster for Al Gore's Oscar- and
Nobel-winning film, An Inconvenient Truth, showing a hurricane coming
out of a smokestack. In the popular imagination, human combustion of
fossil fuels warms the planet, leading to epic hurricanes, floods, heat
waves, droughts, and wildfires that devastate societies.

The first part of this notion is unquestionably true: the planet is
warming due to human activities, primarily carbon dioxide emissions. But
[the second part, that a warming planet is the cause of]{.underline} the
[extreme weather]{.underline} events we are experiencing today, [is
**vastly oversimplified**]{.underline} and exaggerated. Day to day, week
to week, season to season, and year to year, [there is enormous
**natural variability**]{.underline} at every level of the earth's
geography and topography, and [in relation to]{.underline} virtually
**[every climate]{.underline}**-related **[phenomenon]{.underline}**
that impacts human societies. The main source of climate variability in
the past, present, and future, in all places and with regard to
[virtually **all** climatic phenomena]{.underline}, [is]{.underline}
still [overwhelmingly **non**-human]{.underline}: [all]{.underline} the
[**random oscillations** in climatic extremes]{.underline} that occur in
a highly complex climate system across all those highly diverse
geographies and topographies.

Indeed, [[natural variability is **far greater**]{.underline}]{.mark}
across all temporal and geographic dimensions [[than]{.mark}
even]{.underline} quite [[**extreme** scenarios]{.mark} for
anthropogenic climate change can **begin** to produce]{.underline}.
Large human populations, for example, occupy capitals as cold as
Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, with an annual mean temperature of 0 degrees
Celsius, and as hot as Khartoum, Sudan, with an annual mean temperature
of 30. Even equatorial regions, where temperatures are relatively
stable, can range from 21 to 31 degrees from season to season and 16 to
32 degrees from night to day. Compare that to extreme projections of, at
most, 4 or 5 degrees Celsius of average warming globally by the end of
this century.

[The idea]{.underline}, then, so perfectly captured by the poster for An
Inconvenient Truth, that [a few degrees of warming would result in
powerful hurricanes and]{.underline} intense heat waves [materializing
out of **thin air** was **always implausible**]{.underline}. We know
that anthropogenic warming can increase rainfall and storm surges from a
hurricane, or make a heat wave hotter. But [there is little evidence
that warming could create a major storm]{.underline}, flood, drought,
[or heat wave where otherwise none would have occurred]{.underline},
rather than making ones that would have happened anyway somewhat worse.

[[The]{.mark} **main [effect]{.mark}** that climate change has on
extreme weather and natural disasters]{.underline}, in other words, [[is
at the **margins**]{.underline}]{.mark}. A heat wave in which daily high
temperatures over the course of, say, a week never dropped below 99
degrees Fahrenheit in the absence of climate change would instead never
drop below perhaps 102 or 103 degrees with the warming that the Earth
has experienced to date. [[A rain event that dropped **10**
inches]{.mark} of rain]{.underline} over 48 hours [[instead produces
**11**]{.underline}]{.mark} inches of rain because of climate change.
And so on.

These examples represent phenomena in which the effects of climate
change are most straightforward and direct. One or [two or three degrees
C]{.underline}elsius [of increase in the average background temperature
results in extremes]{.underline}, both warm and cold, [being one or
**two or three** degrees **warmer**]{.underline}, possibly a bit more,
possibly a bit less, depending on the event and location. Similarly, a
degree of warming results in the atmosphere holding about 7 percent more
water vapor, which translates to about the same percentage increase in
rainfall.

In these cases, climate science theory and observations are well
aligned. Climate change has increased the frequency of extreme heat
events and decreased the frequency of extreme cold events. It has led to
global sea level rise and glacial melting. At the regional level, some
areas have also seen increases in phenomena like extreme precipitation
events that are very directly linked to warming global temperatures.

But [for most climate and weather phenomena, the effects
are]{.underline} much more [complicated and don't always run in the
**same direction**]{.underline}. Warmer surface and ocean temperatures,
for instance, produce more rain from hurricanes, because warmer air can
hold more water vapor. But [[climate change can **also** create
**countervailing factors**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[such as]{.mark}
increases in **[wind shear]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[which]{.mark} may
[make it **harder** for hurricanes to develop]{.mark}]{.underline} and
persist, [and **decrease** their **frequency**]{.underline}.

Media accounts have been quick to tie hurricanes and other complex
phenomena to climate change. But [there is **little data** to
suggest]{.underline}, thus far, that [these events have actually gotten
**worse**]{.underline}. The share of tropical cyclones that are Category
3 to 5, the strongest storms, has risen in recent decades. But [overall
tropical [cyclone activity has **decreased**]{.mark}]{.underline}. (See
Figure 2, below.) As a result, the absolute number of major storms has
remained fairly steady over time.

The situation is similar with other complex weather phenomena. Globally,
[the area burned by]{.underline} wild[**fires** has
**decreased**]{.underline}. [[There has been **no**]{.mark} **detectable
global [trend]{.mark}** [in]{.mark}]{.underline} river [[**floods**
nor]{.mark} for]{.underline} the total land area flooded. There is
likewise no detectable trend globally in meteorological
**[[drought]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Regionally, the trends
vary]{.underline}, with some parts of the world seeing increases in
phenomena such as flooding, wildfire, and rainfall, and others seeing
decreases. The area burned by wildfire in the Western United States, for
instance, has increased. But climate change is just one contributing
factor, alongside the long-term increase in fuel loads in U.S. forests
due to a century of fire suppression and the fact that there are a lot
more people living in forested areas to start fires.

Many extreme weather events will continue to intensify, or become more
frequent, absent rapid cuts in global emissions, as the climate
continues to warm. But like today, [the effects will continue to be **on
the margins** of **natural variability**]{.underline}. IPCC projections
suggest that the 1 extra inch of rain that global warming now adds to a
once-in-fifty years 10-inch rainstorm will instead be 3 or 4 extra
inches if we hit 3 degrees of warming. High temperatures in a heat wave
that today hit 42 degrees Celsius might hit 45 or 46 degrees with 3
degrees of warming. Global warming--induced sea level rise of, on
average, 9 to 10 inches globally over the last 150 years might rise
another foot or two by 2100.

There is also concern about so-called "tipping points"---the possibility
that some processes could result in a step change in the way that
warming affects the climate. Some scientists have proposed, for
instance, that climate change might result in a slowing down of the
Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, the system of ocean
currents through which the Gulf Stream brings warm water to the North
Atlantic and moderates temperatures across much of Europe. Others
suggest that the thawing of permafrost, and of methane hydrates on the
seafloor, could result in rapid release of methane and accelerate
warming, or that ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica could
disintegrate rapidly, leading sea levels to rise much faster than most
current estimates suggest.

But while it is clear that continuing warming risks triggering these and
other potential tipping points, those that function at global scales and
have the potential to significantly impact the global climate do not
appear to be particularly abrupt phenomena that would bring major and
immediate global impacts. [When scientists speak of things like "rapid"
release of methane or melting of ice sheets, they generally mean rapid
in **geological time**]{.underline}. [These processes would unfold over
**centuries** or **millennia**, not **decades**.]{.underline}

We don't precisely know, moreover, how much additional warming would be
necessary to trigger many of these tipping points. [Nor do we even know
if the feedbacks will all run in the **same direction**, toward a
**hotter planet**]{.underline}. One recent review of the literature,
"Mechanisms and Impacts of Earth System Tipping Elements," concluded
that [a cascading series of tipping points and **climate feedbacks**,
**taken together**, might in the **worst case** increase warming by
**half a degree**]{.underline} Celsius by 2300. Some of these changes
would be irreversible. Thawing methane from the sea floor would never be
restored and major ice sheets in Greenland and West Antarctica would
take hundreds of thousands of years to recover if they were lost. But
[there is **little basis** for claims that surpassing these tipping
points risks triggering irreversible, **runaway warming**]{.underline},
as many people have long feared.

Rather, [[climate change]{.underline}]{.mark} over the rest of this
century [will make the world **marginally** hotter]{.underline} almost
everywhere. It will make some weather events such as extreme rainfall
more intense than they otherwise would be. And it will result in some
other extremes being more frequent or intense in some parts of the world
and less so in others. [But it [will not shift the **basic function** of
the **Earth**]{.mark} **system** [into]{.mark} a **profoundly different
state**]{.underline}, [[one]{.mark} that [human]{.mark}
societie**[s]{.mark}** [are]{.mark}]{.underline} entirely **[[unfamiliar
with]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[or create]{.mark} weather
[extremes]{.mark} far **[outside]{.mark}** [the range]{.mark} of
extremes that human [societies have dealt with]{.mark}]{.underline} in
various geographies that they have long inhabited.

4\. Tipping points

Climate tipping points, from Lenton et al. (2019)

As the world warms, we will begin to approach tipping points,
large-scale climate discontinuities that could lead to major increases
in total warming (Lenton et al. 2019). [Could tipping points put us
on]{.underline} an irreversible [course towards **existential
catastrophe**]{.underline} by 2100?

The first thing to say is that, as with the paleoclimate, tipping points
need to be contextualized within our understanding of specific
mechanisms, such as sea level rise, heat stress and crop failure, by
which climate change could lead to existential catastrophe. We have seen
that [[even the **most outlandish** warming scenarios do not pose
a]{.mark} credible [threat of existential
catastrophe]{.mark}]{.underline} through any of these mechanisms. So
even if tipping points raise the probability of extreme warming, it [is
not clear that they provide a **new** and **credible pathway** towards
**existential catastrophe**.]{.underline}

More to the point, Halstead reviews each of the proposed tipping points
in the diagram above and argues in detail that none of these tipping
points presents a credible threat of human extinction. I will review a
few representative examples below. (Interested readers are invited to
consult Chapter 8 of the Halstead report).

Begin with dieback of the Amazon rainforest in the tropics and boreal
forests near the arctic. Both forests play an important role in trapping
carbon, preventing it from reaching the atmosphere.

Halstead suggests (plausibly) that boreal forest [[dieback
is]{.underline}]{.mark} likely to be something of [[a
**wash**]{.underline}]{.mark}. As the world warms, the southernmost
reaches of boreal forests will become too warm to support existing
forests. But at the same time, boreal [[forests will **expand
north**]{.mark}**wards**]{.underline} into land that was previously too
cold to support them. For this reason, boreal forest dieback is not
expected to pose a significant existential threat anytime soon.

Amazon rainforest dieback is a bit more concerning. Indeed, Halstead
suggests, there is a good chance that human-caused deforestation will
continue to devastate the Amazon rainforest alongside the destruction
caused by climate change. However, Halstead reminds us, most [[tropical
forests fluorished during the **Eocene**]{.mark} period, in which
periods were]{.underline} more than **[[10°]{.mark}C
[hotter]{.mark}]{.underline}** than they are today. So there is no ready
inference from present-day warming to a catastrophic collapse of the
Amazon rainforest.

As Halstead reminds us, the IPCC's latest assessment report estimates
that even on pessimistic warming scenarios (4°C warming combined with
some pessimistic modeling assumptions), Amazon [dieback is expected to
contribute about]{.underline} 0**[.3]{.underline}**°C of additional
warming. A catastrophe? Yes. But [an **existential** catastrophe?
**Certainly not**]{.underline}.

[What about]{.underline} arctic **[permafrost]{.underline}**? A great
deal of carbon is currently trapped in the arctic permafrost, and as the
world warms, permafrost will gradually melt, releasing carbon into the
atmosphere. At Halstead reminds us, [the **IPCC**]{.underline} currently
[projects]{.underline} that each 1°C of warming will lead to 18 gigatons
of carbon (GtC) released from arctic [[permafrost]{.underline}]{.mark}.
That [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} roughly [[**two percent** of the
amount]{.underline}]{.mark} projected [[to be released by
**2100**]{.underline}]{.mark} on a middle-of-the-road scenario (RCP 4.5)
by the IPCC. As before, this is a regrettable catastrophe, but hardly an
existential threat.

What about the most speculative scenarios? A rather controversial paper
by Will Steffen and colleagues, "Trajectories of the earth system in the
Anthropocene" predicts that once we reach 2°C of warming, the world will
enter a \`Hothouse Earth' phase, in which even with little additional
use of fossil fuels, cumulative warming will reach 6°C above
preindustrial levels.

Hothouse earth, Steffen et al. (2018)

At the risk of beating a very dead horse, the first thing to say about
[[this]{.mark} scenario]{.underline} is that it **[[still would not
kill]{.mark} us]{.underline}**. We have reviewed almost every plausible
direct mechanism (heat stress, crop failure, sea level rise, ...) by
which warming could lead to existential catastrophe. And we have seen
that none of these mechanisms plausibly threatens anything like
existential catastrophe even under the extreme assumption of 6°C
warming.

More to the point, [\`[Hothouse Earth' is]{.mark}]{.underline} rather
**[[speculative]{.mark} science]{.underline}**, [and media coverage has
**stretched its conclusions**]{.underline} far beyond those initial
speculations. The model itself is highly uncertain and presents options
for avoiding catastrophe. Here is Richard Bettes, Professor of Climate
Impacts at the University of Exeter:

With some exceptions, much of the highest-profile coverage of the essay
presents the scenario as definite and imminent. The impression is given
that 2°C is a definite "point of no return", and that beyond that the
"hothouse" scenario will rapidly arrive. Many articles ignore the
caveats that the 2°C threshold is extremely uncertain, and that even if
it were correct, the [[**extreme conditions** would not occur
for]{.mark} **centuries** or **[millennia]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Richard Betts, "Hothouse earth: Here's what the science actually says"

And what exactly is the research-backed case behind \`Hothouse Earth'?
Here things get a bit hairy, because as Betts reminds us, Steffen et al.
(2018) is an opinion piece, not a standalone research paper, and as such
it really doesn't do the kind of modeling that would be needed to
advance its thesis to the realm of serious credibility.

One thing that strikes me about the scientific literature on "tipping
points" is that there are a lot of review papers like this that end up
citing the same studies and each other ... There is a great deal of
interesting, insightful research going on using theoretical methods and
calculations with large approximations. However, we have yet to see an
equivalent level of research in the highly-complex Earth System Models
which generate the kind of detailed climate projections used for
addressing policy-relevant questions by the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC). Steffen and colleagues have made a good start at
addressing such questions, going as far as they can on the basis of the
existing literature, but their essay should motivate new research to
help narrow down the huge uncertainties. This will help us see better
whether "Hothouse Earth" is our destiny, or mere speculation.

Richard Betts, "Hothouse earth: Here's what the science actually says"

At the risk of piling on, Halstead adds another objection to the mix --
Steffen and colleagues seem to have forgotten to argue for the main
conclusion of their paper: that climate feedbacks could generate six
degrees of warming. Halstead collects together
**[[all]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the **[[feedback]{.mark}
effect[s]{.mark}]{.underline}** mentioned by Steffen and colleagues in
the main text:

Source: Steffen et al. (2018) via Halstead

The problem? These [[add up to]{.mark} a mere 0**[.47]{.mark}°C** of
warming [by **2100**]{.mark}]{.underline}! [[If
feedback]{.underline}]{.mark} effect[[s]{.underline}]{.mark} [[are to
take us from]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[2]{.underline}]{.mark}**°C of
\[[[to]{.underline}]{.mark}\] **[[6]{.underline}]{.mark}**°C of warming,
[Steffen and [colleagues need to find an additional
**3.5**]{.mark}**3[°]{.mark}**]{.underline}C **[of
warming]{.underline}** after 2100 due to feedback effects.

Steffen and colleagues certainly claim that this additional warming will
occur. But they are not terribly precise about the details. As Halstead
puts it: "they do not explain what might cause the remaining 3.5°C of
warming over millennia implied by their Figure 1".

[This sort of speculative modeling]{.underline} can be a good impetus
for future work, but it [should not be taken as a **scientifically
respectable ground** for **alarmist predictions**]{.underline} of the
likelihood of impending existential catastrophe due to climate change.
[There is simply **not enough evidence** to ground such
predictions]{.underline}.

Abstract

[For much of human history, water was a standard weapon of war. In the
[post]{.mark}--**[W]{.mark}**orld **[W]{.mark}**ar **[II]{.mark}**
period, however]{.underline}, nation-[states]{.underline} in
international conflict [have [made]{.mark} **concerted
[efforts]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} **[restrain]{.mark}** the
[**weaponization** of water]{.mark}. **Distinct** from **realist** and
**rationalist** explanations, the [historical record
reveals]{.mark}]{.underline} that [water has come to be governed
by]{.underline} a set of [[**intersubjective** standards]{.mark} of
behavior that [denounce **water**]{.mark}]{.underline}\'s involvement in
[[**conflict** as]{.mark} **morally [taboo]{.mark}**]{.underline}. How
did this water taboo develop, and how does it matter for nation-states?
Focused process-tracing illuminates the taboo\'s development from the
1950s to the 2010s, and indicates that (1) a moral aversion to using
water as a weapon exists; (2) this aversion developed through cumulative
mechanisms of taboo evolution over the past seventy years; and (3) [the
[taboo **influences states**]{.mark} at]{.underline} both [an
**instrumental level** of **compliance**, and]{.underline}, in recent
decades, [a more **internalized** level]{.underline}. These findings
offer new avenues for research and policy to better understand and
uphold this taboo into the future.

Introduction

Where water was once a standard weapon of armed conflict between
nation-states, up until the Korean War, the latter half of the twentieth
century witnessed a remarkable strengthening of state consciousness
against weaponizing water in conflict. Water weaponization is the use of
water as physical arms, typically through deprivation (too little water)
and inundation (too much), oriented toward strategic and tactical ends.
As this normative inhibition---[a "water taboo"---evolved in the
post--World War II era, it]{.underline} progressively [ruled out the use
of water as a weapon]{.underline} in a range of armed conflicts that was
once acceptable, and where such use may have been strategically
beneficial.

This study contends that a taboo against weaponizing water began to
emerge in the 1950s, and has developed into an intricate mosaic of
principles built through cumulative mechanisms of taboo evolution. The
late 1960s and 1970s were a turning point for the taboo, as water became
embedded in an international enterprise to delegitimize inhumane warfare
and protect civilians and the environment. Rather than an object to be
used at will in conflict, water was flagged as warranting restraint.1 In
parallel to this strengthening moral current, [nearly all]{.underline}
nation-[states **[renounced]{.mark}** the weaponization of water [and
became]{.mark} **de facto [custodians]{.mark}** [of water]{.mark},
**[condemning]{.mark}** those few [states that continued]{.mark} to
weaponize it]{.underline}.2

How did the water taboo evolve in the contemporary period? How does it
influence state behavior?3 To be sure, the water taboo is not altogether
new, having roots in religious, philosophical, and ancient Mesopotamian
legal thought.4 This body of thought lacked cohesion, however, and was
most often suppressed by strategic motives to use water. For much of
human history, water was a standard weapon that delivered results. Goths
cut major aqueducts to besiege Rome and befall the Eastern Roman Empire
(537--538 c.e.);5 Goguryeo forces of Korea drowned 300,000 Chinese
soldiers to win the Battle of Salsu (612 c.e.);6 Mongols opened dikes to
flood and sack Baghdad (1258 c.e.);7 Germans led the Herero people into
the Omaheke desert to die of dehydration (1904 c.e.);8 and Axis and
Allied powers poisoned water, flooded land, and bombed dams to undermine
one another in World War II (1939--45 c.e.).9

Rising scarcity of water has bolstered its military utility. Water is a
vital resource that states cannot do without. Over the past half
century, water scarcity has accelerated on the wave of population
growth, urbanization, and environmental degradation, with half the
world\'s population living in severe scarcity at least one month per
year.10 Certainly, nonstate actors have viciously capitalized on water
stress. Most recently, from 2014 to 2017 the Islamic State (IS) seized
water sources in Iraq and Syria, closing dam gates in Ramadi and
Fallujah and contaminating water with oil.11 These tactics sought to
"hold the entire region hostage," effectively creating dependence on IS
for water supply and inducing compliance of many pro-government towns.12
In the face of water\'s historical weaponization and continued utility
with rising scarcity, it is intriguing that [the [water taboo]{.mark}
has **gathered force** and **[influenced]{.mark} state
[practice]{.mark}** [today]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Dubious correlations/causality

We argue that **[selective use of evidence]{.underline}** and/or the
disproportionate and ill-informed attention to specific complex and
contested rivers [is]{.underline} partially [responsible
for]{.underline} the re-emergence [of '[water wars' headlines]{.mark}
that]{.underline} can [**obscure** what is really going on and
**[mislead]{.mark}** [the]{.mark} wider [public]{.mark}. Recent studies
on the]{.underline} negative [effects of **[biased]{.mark} selection**
of case-[studies]{.mark}]{.underline} and on the links/variables
describing climate-conflict relationships [illustrate how easy it
is]{.underline}, as a result, [to **[skew]{.mark}** public
[perceptions]{.mark}. These biases are]{.underline} essentially
**[reductionist]{.underline}** and limit wider public understanding of
the complexities at stake.

[[In the **Nile**]{.underline}]{.mark}, for instance, [many processes of
[cooperation are **in parallel**]{.mark}]{.underline} with the wider
discourse of dispute and conflict [[but]{.mark} are]{.underline} often
[**[ignored]{.mark}** in the]{.underline} mainstream [media. If they
were given more air time, the **'slide to [war']{.mark} thesis** [would
look]{.mark}]{.underline} somewhat [**[threadbare]{.mark}** and
**misleading**. Some studies do]{.underline} convincingly
[link]{.underline} climate change and [water scarcity to]{.underline}
particular [**[local]{.mark} level, [low-intensity]{.mark}**
[violence]{.mark}, but these **[cannot]{.mark} then [be
extrapolated]{.mark} up and out** to **larger** geographic]{.underline}
(e.g. river basin) [or political/administrative (e.g. **inter-state**)
contexts. Indeed, **exhaustive studies** show inter-state water conflict
to be **extremely rare** in most international contexts and
[cooperation]{.mark} and even **peacebuilding** [are **closer to the**
norm]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Water shortages [empirically]{.underline} create opportunities for [cooperation]{.underline}, not [conflict]{.underline}.

Water Wars Myth\", OpenMind Magazine,

"Water shortages are brewing wars," warned the BBC last year.
**[[People]{.underline}]{.mark}** who worry about climate change [are
[**drawn** **to**]{.mark} this **dramatic**, **high-stakes
idea**]{.underline}. After all, persistent droughts and destructive
floods are symptoms of a changing climate, and it seems irresistibly
intuitive to claim that when water becomes scarce or unpredictable,
states will go to war with each other to secure it. But [by paying so
much attention]{.underline} [to]{.underline} an
**[[exaggerated]{.underline}]{.mark}**, simplistic
[[scenario]{.underline}]{.mark} (even with good intentions), [we
**[miss]{.mark}**]{.underline} the true [risks]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} [[water]{.underline}
**[shortage]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[s]{.underline}** [and the
**[solutions]{.mark}**]{.underline} at hand.

[Take]{.underline} the current [conflict in
[Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[described]{.underline}]{.mark}** by
some people [as a [conflict over]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[water]{.underline}]{.mark}: Russia intervened, they say, to ensure
Crimea would get water that Ukraine has been holding back since 2014.
But [alleged [causes]{.mark} of the ongoing invasion **[also]{.mark}**
**[include]{.mark}** [economics]{.mark}]{.underline}, identity,
**[[history]{.underline}]{.mark}**, security, [[and]{.mark} [an]{.mark}
**[unhinged]{.mark}**]{.underline} **[[dictator]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

This does not mean that water is immaterial. Water infrastructure can be
a target in war, as when Russian forces cut off Mariupol from its water
supply to conquer the city. Water can also be weaponized, as both
Ukrainian and Russian forces have done by breaching dams to flood the
landscape and shift the odds in the ground fight. And, of course,
localized conflicts can ignite over water when institutions collapse, as
when Russian-backed separatists took over parts of the Donbass region in
2014, cutting in half the Soviet-era integrated water system that served
it. History is littered with examples of times when water, or the
infrastructure designed to manage it, played some role in war. But that
is not the same as being the cause of an international war. Attributing
wars to water scarcity implies that material conditions inevitably
determine armed conflict, when in fact military aggression is almost
always a matter of choice.

[[Blaming]{.mark} war on [water]{.mark}
**[absolves]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[politicians]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} their
**[[responsibility]{.underline}]{.mark}** and [**deprives** people of
their **agency**]{.underline}, [[undermining efforts to]{.mark}
**[resolve]{.mark}**]{.underline} the very
**[[conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark}** water is supposedly driving. There
are 310 river basins straddling national boundaries, covering nearly
half of the earth's land surface and home to half of humanity. Many of
those rivers are under stress today. [Focusing]{.underline}
[on]{.underline} them as possible theaters of war---as the "[**water**
**wars**]{.underline}" story would have it---[**[diverts]{.mark}** us
from [seeing]{.mark}]{.underline} them for what they could be: 310
**[[instruments]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[of]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[peace]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In fact,
**[[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}** rather than conflict [is the
[most **common**]{.mark} [response]{.mark} to]{.underline} a
**[difficult]{.underline}** [water situation]{.underline}.

In contemporary culture, the [thesis of a war over water has a
**modern** archetype]{.underline}: the **[Arab--Israeli
conflict]{.underline}**. The Jordan River, more than 300 kilometers
long, is fed by tributaries in southern Lebanon and Syria and flows into
the Sea of Galilee. From there it receives water from two more
tributaries on its eastern bank---the Yarmouk and the Zarqa---and runs
along borders that, after the armistice in 1949, separated Israel and
the West Bank on one side from Jordan on the other.

In the early 1950s, both Israel and the Kingdom of Jordan began drawing
from that system to support economic development. Jordan announced plans
to divert the Yarmouk. Two years later, Israel began construction of its
National Water Carrier, a system of pipelines and canals that would draw
water mainly from the Sea of Galilee. These [developments]{.underline}
were **[not]{.underline}** meant as **[threats]{.underline}**, but they
set the stage for what happened next.

By 1956, with Israel's Carrier system still under construction,
[Egypt]{.underline} had **[blocked]{.underline}** [Israeli]{.underline}
[ships]{.underline} [from]{.underline} [passing]{.underline}
[through]{.underline} the trade route of the **[Suez
Canal]{.underline}**. Amid growing tensions, in 1964 Egyptian president
Gamal Nasser convened a summit of Arab states---a meeting notable for
the birth of the Palestinian Liberation Organization. Famously,
participants declared that the continued economic development of Israel
would displace more Palestinians and pose an existential threat to the
Arab world.

One way to constrain Israel's development was to divert the Syrian
headwaters of the Jordan River, reducing the amount reaching the Sea of
Galilee by about a third and limiting what Israel could draw for its
Carrier system. With construction of the system finally completed,
Israel declared the diversion an infringement of its sovereign rights.
[Things **escalated**]{.underline}, and in May 1967 Nasser's troops
surrounded Israel. During the Six Day War that followed, Israel
destroyed the Syrian diversion and took over the Golan Heights, West
Bank, Gaza Strip, and Sinai, vastly extending its control over the
region. This not only secured control of the Jordan River but gave
Israel access to the aquifers below the West Bank. Its National Water
Carrier had even more room to grow.

Water clearly played a key role in this conflict. The Arab attempt to
divert the headwaters weaponized the river's sources. But
[[water]{.mark} was **[not]{.mark}** the **[cause]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
the [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}. Water in the [Jordan]{.underline}
[valley]{.underline} [has]{.underline} [always]{.underline}
[been]{.underline} [scarce]{.underline}. It took the carving up of the
Middle East, Israel's quest for statehood, Arab nations' refusal to
recognize it, and Egypt's desire for Arab unity and expansion to fuel
war.

Besides, [the]{.underline} very same **[war]{.underline}**
**[offered]{.underline}** an important, if incomplete,
[example]{.underline} [of]{.underline} [how]{.underline}
[difficult]{.underline} [water]{.underline} [conditions]{.underline}
could **[[facilitate]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[peace]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Following]{.underline} 1978
[negotiations]{.underline} at Camp David, Anwar [Sadat]{.underline},
Nasser's successor as president of Egypt, [resurrected]{.underline} an
[old water plan]{.underline}, **[offering]{.underline}**
**[Israel]{.underline}** its **[Nile]{.underline}**
**[waters]{.underline}** to develop the Negev desert in the hopes of
[finding]{.underline} a workable **[compromise]{.underline}**
[for]{.underline} regional **[stability]{.underline}**. Sadat was
assassinated in 1981 and nothing came of the offer, but the [attempt
showed how]{.underline} water [[scarcity]{.underline}]{.mark}
[could]{.underline} [be [a]{.mark} **[precursor]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[rather]{.underline}]{.mark} [[than]{.underline}]{.mark}
[a]{.underline} **[[cause]{.underline}]{.mark}** of
**[[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Despite this, the "water wars" thesis held sway, attracting serious
public attention when Sadat claimed that water was "the only matter that
could take Egypt to war again." In 1985 Sadat's former minister of state
for foreign affairs, Boutros Boutros-Ghali (later the secretary general
of the United Nations), reprised this statement, claiming that
the next war in the Middle East "will be fought over water, not
politics," a thinly veiled threat to states along the Nile.

Then, in [1995]{.underline}, during a **[speech]{.underline}** to water
experts in Stockholm, another Egyptian, World Bank Vice President Ismaïl
Serageldin, claimed that "if the [wars of the 20th century were
**fought** over **oil**]{.underline}, "the wars of the [**21st**
**century** will be]{.underline} fought over **[water]{.underline}**."
Serageldin wasn't literally predicting a water war; he was drawing
people's attention to the importance of water management. This time the
[alliterative phrase]{.underline} was **[picked up]{.underline}** widely
**[by media]{.underline}**, including the New York Times, Newsweek, and
CNN.

[Cooperation]{.underline}, [not conflict]{.underline}, [is
the]{.underline} recurrent [theme]{.underline} [when nations share a
water source]{.underline}.

Public fascination with the idea of a water war led academics to
investigate its empirical basis. Scholars dug into the past to find
evidence of military conflicts between nations over water. The [very
**[first]{.mark}** [water]{.mark} [war]{.mark}]{.underline} in recorded
history [[was]{.mark}]{.underline} described in [the [Stele of]{.mark}
[Vultures]{.mark}]{.underline}. The stele is a Sumerian monument from
about 4,500 years ago whose fragments are at the Louvre in Paris. It
tells the story of what could be called a water war between Umma and
Lagash, two city-states in lower Mesopotamia, between Baghdad and Basra
in modern Iraq. But the [geographer]{.underline} Aaron
[Wolf]{.underline} of Oregon State University, a [prominent
[expert]{.mark}]{.underline} in water-related
conflicts, [**[wrote]{.mark}** ]{.underline}that if this was the first
water war, [[**it** **was**]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[**the**
**last**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[Overwhelmingly]{.underline}, the **[evidence]{.underline}** that Wolf
and others have collected [shows]{.underline} that
**[[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[not]{.mark}
[conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[is]{.underline}
[the]{.underline}]{.mark} [recurrent **[theme]{.mark}**]{.underline}
when nations share a water source. The most famous example of this took
place in the Indus River valley. More than 3,000 kilometers long, the
river rises in western Tibet and Kashmir, flows through the Punjab in
India and Sindh in Pakistan, and finally empties into the Arabian Sea.

One of the most egregious legacies of the British Raj was that, at the
time of independence for India and Pakistan in 1947, this river basin
was split between the two countries with no regard for the
infrastructure that had turned it into the largest contiguous irrigation
system in the world. Most of the irrigated land went to Pakistan, but
the infrastructure that ended up in India could stop the flow to its
neighbor almost entirely. With no rules of engagement and no history of
joint management, the newly formed states faced severe tensions over
water, among other things. Ethnicity itself caused a crisis. In what has
been called the biggest migration of the century, an estimated 15
million people moved across the new border in a matter of months. Hindus
moved to India and Muslims to Pakistan while community ethnic cleansing
left a long trail of victims and hatred along the migration paths.

It was an inauspicious start to separation, but the two countries had no
choice. They had to manage the shared river, and that is what they did.

In 1960, after protracted negotiations, Field Marshal Ayub Khan of
Pakistan and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of India signed the Indus
Waters Treaty. The treaty divided the tributaries of the river between
the two countries, established a World Bank infrastructure financing
package to reengineer the river in service of both, and, crucially,
adopted mechanisms for arbitration so that neither country could pose an
existential threat to the other. It was imperfect, as all international
agreements are. Yet it was a treaty between two countries that would
soon become nuclear powers. Remarkably, it has withstood the test of
time, surviving the conflict of 1965, the independence of Bangladesh in
1971, and the Kargil conflict of 1999. It stands to this day as an
extraordinary monument to cooperation between rivals that work together
on the river, even when at war over other things.

Popular culture has drawn the wrong lesson from history. A
**[[fear]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[of]{.underline}]{.mark}
"[[water]{.mark} **[wars]{.mark}**]{.underline}" is a
**[[misreading]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of]{.underline}
[water]{.underline} [[events]{.underline}]{.mark}. From the Jordan to
the Indus to the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, shared among Turkey, Iraq,
and Syria, the lesson is always the same: [[Even]{.mark} the **[most
difficult]{.mark}** of **neighbors** [can]{.mark} [find]{.mark} a
**route** to **[cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [over
water]{.underline}. This does not make it easy, nor is it inevitable.
But a [failure]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [cooperate]{.underline}
[does]{.underline} [not]{.underline} [lead]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
[armed international conflict]{.underline}. Instead it produces
persistent water insecurity and suffering. Unmanaged scarcity can
cripple economies; uncontrolled floods can destroy communities; both can
lead to migration.

The [focus]{.underline} [on]{.underline} "[water wars]{.underline}"
**[blinds]{.underline}** [us]{.underline} [to]{.underline} the
[opportunity]{.underline} [for]{.underline} [cooperation]{.underline}
and the need to encourage it. In the first few months of 2022,
skirmishes have broken out between Taliban and Iranian forces where the
Helmand River crosses the border between Afghanistan and Iran. The
Taliban reacted to alleged attempts at dredging additional canals.
Iranian farmers, in turn, protested over perceived threats to the water
flowing from Afghanistan. These are not "water wars," though; localized
skirmishes are not unusual when individuals or communities fight over
water, but they happen precisely because states have been unable to
develop effective cooperation.

Afghanistan is struggling with a severe drought and insufficient
infrastructure to manage its own water resources, risking a famine of
unprecedented scale. Over the last few months, a flood not of water but
of people, mostly fleeing the Taliban and hunger, has been crossing the
border out of the country. The high number of refugees is putting
further pressure on Iranian communities, which then react with
anti-Afghan protests, compounding tensions. The management of
**[[water]{.underline}]{.mark}** resources is central to overcoming
these problems. It [[is a **cure**]{.mark} for conflict, [not]{.mark} a
**[cause]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

What these neighbors need are better institutions to support
cooperation, reliable data to manage the river, and institutions to
negotiate joint river management as the flow changes over time.
Cooperation is the key to survival. From the Helmand, the Jordan, and
the Nile to the Mekong between China and its neighbors downstream to all
the other international rivers worldwide, water offers an opportunity to
cooperate across borders. [[In]{.mark} the [face of]{.mark} **climate
change** and **[deteriorating water security]{.mark}**, the real
challenge is [not]{.mark} **[war]{.mark}** [but]{.mark} successful
**[cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. That, above all, will safeguard
the future of the shared waters of the world.

Some people falsely believe that the Afghanistan takeover by the Taliban
during a drought increases the risk of violence over shared waters such
as the Helmand and Kabul Rivers. [Violent]{.underline}

What Is the Contemporary 'Water Wars' Hypothesis and What's Wrong With
It?

Defense ministers, military generals, NGOs, UN Secretaries-General and
[environment]{.underline}-[focused]{.underline} [academics]{.underline}
all **[repeat]{.underline}** the [**misguided** hypothesis]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} increasing [resource scarcity]{.underline}
[leads]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [conflict]{.underline}. Since Al
Gore's Inconvenient Truth movie, the [[narrative keeps
expanding]{.underline}]{.mark} to include climate-induced mass
migration, climate disasters, and even climate wars.

Indian geostrategist Brahma Chellaney has recently argued that water is
the new oil and claims that water will be the centerpiece of power
struggle in Asia. This year, [tensions between]{.underline}
[Ethiopia]{.underline}, [Sudan]{.underline}, [and Egypt]{.underline}
over filling the enormous Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Nile
River has also [refueled **[water]{.mark}** war theories]{.underline}.
After the summer floods in Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands,
European Commissioner Frans Timmermans repeatedly predicted that there
will be future wars over food and water unless there are 55 percent
reductions in carbon dioxide emissions by 2030. Military analysts such
as retired Dutch General Tom Middendorp, chairman of the International
Military Council on Climate and Security, has repeatedly aligned himself
with the water wars (and climate-induced mass migration) discourse.
The Water, Peace, and Security Partnership was set up by the Netherlands
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the German Agency for International
Cooperation and a consortium of six partners to forecast and understand
water-related conflicts and organized violence.

Climate change will intensify [weather extremes]{.underline}, but

\[italics in original\]

The [conventional story was]{.underline} that [the [ocean]{.mark}
was]{.underline} kind of **[dead for millions of years]{.underline}**
[after]{.underline} this **[[mass extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
says paleontologist Peter Roopnarine of the California Academy of
Sciences in San Francisco, who was not involved in the research. "Well,
[that's]{.underline} [**[not true]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [The ocean
[\[was\]]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[very]{.underline}**]{.mark} much
**[[alive]{.underline}]{.mark}**."

[The]{.underline} Great Dying, or **[[Permian-Triassic]{.mark} mass
[extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [occurred]{.underline} around 251.9
million years ago, at the end of the Permian Period, [after a series of
massive volcanic eruptions]{.underline} (*SN: 12/6/18*).

"The [[oceans]{.underline} **[warmed
significantly]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [and there's [ev]{.mark}idence
[for]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[acidification]{.underline}**]{.mark},
deoxygenation \[causing widespread **[dead zones]{.underline}**\], [[as
well as]{.underline} **[poisoning]{.underline}**]{.mark}," says
Roopnarine. "There \[were\] a lot of toxic elements like sulfur entering
into parts of the ocean."

[Life]{.underline} in the seas **[suffered]{.underline}**. More than 80
percent of [marine species went]{.underline} **[extinct]{.underline}**.
[Some researchers]{.underline} have [even proposed that]{.underline}
**[entire trophic levels]{.underline}** --- castes in an ecosystem's
food web --- [may have vanished]{.underline}.

Figuring out how long life took to fully recover in the wake of all that
loss has been challenging. In 2010, researchers studying fossils from
the Luoping biota in China proposed that complex marine ecosystems fully
rebounded within 10 million years. Later, other fossil finds, such as
the Paris biota in the western United States and the Chaohu biota in
China, led scientists to suggest that marine ecosystems reestablished
themselves within just 3 million years.

Then in 2015, a serendipitous discovery narrowed the gap again.
Paleontologist Xu Dai, then an undergraduate student at the China
University of Geosciences in Wuhan, was studying rocks from the early
Triassic during a field trip near the city of Guiyang, when he split
open a piece of black shale. Within the rock, he discovered a
surprisingly well-preserved fossil of what would later be identified as
a primitive lobster.

The arthropod's immaculate condition sparked a series of return trips.
From 2015 to 2019, Dai, now at the University of Burgundy in Dijon,
France, and his colleagues uncovered a bricolage of fossilized life:
Predatory fish as long as baseball bats. Ammonoids in swirled shells.
Eel-like conodonts. Early shrimps. Sponges. Bivalves. Fossilized poo.

And the prizes kept coming. Both under and within the Guiyang biota, Dai
and his colleagues discovered beds of volcanic ash. An
[analysis]{.underline} of the amounts of uranium and lead in the ash
[revealed]{.underline} that the Guiyang biota contained
**[fossils]{.underline}** from roughly 250.7 to 250.8 million years ago
(SN: 5/2/22). The [dating was]{.underline} further [supported by
the]{.underline} **[types of fossils]{.underline}** [found and by an
analysis of the different forms of carbon in the rocks]{.underline}.

Finding [a]{.underline} **[[potpourri of life]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of
this age [suggests]{.mark}]{.underline} that [marine
[ecosystems]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[rebounded
quickly]{.underline}**]{.mark} [after the Great Dying]{.underline},
within just 1 million years or so, Dai says.

Alternatively, it may indicate that [the]{.underline} **[extinction
event]{.underline}** [[failed to wipe out]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[entire]{.underline}** [[trophic levels]{.underline}]{.mark}, says
paleontologist William Foster from the University of Hamburg in Germany,
who was not involved in the study. "You [have this]{.underline}
**[really]{.underline}** [[environmentally stressful]{.mark} world,
[but]{.mark}]{.underline} some former **[[marine ecosystems
survive]{.underline}]{.mark}**."

Regardless, [it seems]{.underline} **[clear]{.underline}** that these
[ecosystems [were]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[hardy]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
Due to the motion of tectonic plates, the community preserved in the
Guiyang biota was located in the tropics during the early Triassic. At
that time, [the [temp]{.mark}erature of the sea]{.underline} surface
[was [nearly]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[35⁰
Celsius]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [and]{.underline} past
[research]{.underline} had [suggested many organisms may have migrated
away to escape the heat]{.underline}. But, [the discovery of
the]{.underline} Guiyang [biota]{.underline}
**[challenges]{.underline}** [that]{.underline}, Foster says. [[Sea
creatures]{.mark} "are]{.underline} tolerating it somehow, they're
**[[adapt]{.mark}ing]{.underline}**."

According to Dai, [the fossils may be evidence]{.underline} that the
roots of [today's marine ecosystems took hold]{.underline} **[shortly
after]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} **[Great Dying]{.underline}**.
"These groups are related to modern fish, lobsters and shrimps, their
ancestors," he says. "The oldest time we can find similar seafood to
today is \[in the time of\] the Guiyang biota."

["Ocean [Acidification]{.mark}": **[New
"Catastrophe,"]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[Same]{.underline}]{.mark} Old
**[[Pattern]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Having addressed all the major alleged climate-related potential dangers
arising from rising CO2 levels, I can confidently say that the case for
climate catastrophe is over.

That said, I can also confidently say that as long as we have an
antiimpact knowledge system and designated experts, new catastrophe
claims will emerge, including new variants on old ones.

I can also confidently say that those **[new]{.underline}** catastrophe
[[claims]{.underline}]{.mark} will [involve the]{.underline} **[same
distortions]{.underline}** as the catastrophe claims I've debunked so
far. [They]{.underline} [will]{.underline} (1) ignore the fundamental
benefits of fossil fuels, (2) especially ignore the environmental
mastery benefits of fossil fuels, and (3) **[wildly
[overstate]{.mark}]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} **[[negative
side-effects]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of]{.underline} **[fossil
fuels]{.underline}**.

Thus, when confronting the latest catastrophe claims, we want to be on
the lookout for these distortions.

At the same time, we are now in a position to bring in a significant
context of knowledge when evaluating any new environmental or climate
concerns.

This context includes the following facts:

> 1\. The global climate system is naturally dangerous, diverse, and
> dynamic.
>
> 2\. An unlivable planet from rising CO2 levels is impossible given the
> history of life flourishing at far greater temperatures and CO2
> levels.
>
> 3\. Fossil-fueled environmental mastery is an enormously powerful
> force for addressing any environmental challenge, natural or man-made.

Having this context of environmental and climate knowledge, along with
awareness of the distortions of the anti-impact framework, puts us in a
powerful position to evaluate new climate claims.

[Let's]{.underline} **[apply]{.underline}** [this context
to]{.underline} the final, relatively new catastrophe claim I'll address
in this book, one that is not strictly a climate claim but is often
coupled with climate claims: catastrophic "**[ocean
acidification]{.underline}**."

[Like all the **other** catastrophe claims, "ocean acidification" is
**billed** as a **catastrophic** or **apocalyptic phenomenon** that
necessitates **eliminating fossil fuels**]{.underline}.

Bill [McKibben calls ocean acidification "the deadly]{.underline}
**[twin]{.underline}** [of global warming]{.underline}" and argues: "The
fact that we're---have already made the oceans 30 percent more acidic
would be, by itself, enough reason to get off fossil fuel, even if it
didn't do a thing to the temperature."\[18\]

Even before looking into the specific evidence about ocean
"acidification," what we've learned about environmental mastery and
about our anti-impact knowledge system's distortions should lead us to
four strong expectations about where the truth lies.

> 1\. [[Given]{.mark} that [life]{.mark}]{.underline} has

Upon investigation, all of these turn out to be true.

Given That Life Has Flourished When CO2 Levels Were Far Higher, Whatever
Change Is Happening to the Oceans Is from Some State Where a Wide
Variety of Life Can Flourish to Another State Where a Wide Variety of
Life Can Flourish

"Ocean acidification" is an increase in CO2 levels in the ocean, which
lowers pH levels.

pH is measured on a scale of 0 to 14, with 7 being "neutral," under 7
being "acidic," and over 7 being "basic" or "alkaline."\[19\]

Given the term "ocean acidification," you'd expect current pH levels to
be well under 7.

But in fact, [mainstream estimates of the average pH of our
[current]{.mark} [oceans]{.mark} are [about]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[8.1]{.underline}**]{.mark}---estimated to have declined from 8.2 in
preindustrial times---**[[very much]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the
**[[alkaline]{.underline}]{.mark}** range.

[Thus we are witnessing]{.underline} very slow [ocean]{.underline}
**["neutralization,"]{.underline}** [not]{.underline}
**["[acidification]{.mark}"]{.underline}**---[acidification is
a]{.underline} **[completely [unscientific]{.mark} term]{.underline}**
used to scare us.

Just as the climate impacts of rising CO2 levels are characterized as
unprecedented and therefore dangerous, so [ocean]{.underline}
**[neutralization]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}
**[characterized]{.underline}** [as]{.underline}
**[unprecedented]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[therefore
dangerous]{.underline}**.

[But given that atmospheric [CO2]{.mark} levels today are]{.underline}
[**[less than one tenth]{.mark} their [historical highs]{.mark}**, and
life]{.underline} **[flourished]{.underline}** [on]{.underline}
**[land]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** in **[water]{.underline}**
[during those highs, we should expect that whatever change is
happening]{.underline} to the oceans [is from some state where a wide
variety of ocean life can flourish to another state to where a wide
variety of ocean life can flourish.]{.underline}

[And this]{.underline} **[turns out to be the case]{.underline}**.

The oceans are vast and diverse, from tropical, shallow reef waters to
icy polar waters thousands of feet deep. [Many of today's ocean species
evolved **hundreds of millions of years ago**, when CO2 levels
were]{.underline} **[far higher]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[temperatures]{.underline}** [were]{.underline} **[far
higher]{.underline}**.\[20\]

[Realistic estimates of future [declines of]{.mark} the average ocean
[pH **don't show**]{.mark} **systematic [negative
impacts]{.mark}**]{.underline} on species, [and [show]{.mark} some
[species]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[benefiting]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[even]{.underline}** [when]{.underline} the decline happens [in
the]{.underline} **[rapid timeframe]{.underline}** [of a]{.underline}
**[lab]{.underline}**oratory **[experiment]{.underline}**.\[21\]

Thus, [**whatever changes are happening**, our [oceans
will]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[continue]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline}]{.mark} [be able to [support]{.mark} a]{.underline}
**[[vast]{.mark} array]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} [**[marine
life]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

The Rate and Consequences of the Change Are Being Wildly, Negatively
Distorted by Our Knowledge System

What changes will ocean neutralization bring about? Given that every
other impact of CO2 has been wildly and negatively distorted by our
knowledge system, we can expect that the rate and consequences of ocean
changes are being similarly distorted. And that turns out to be the
case.

Though continuing increases of atmospheric CO2 would make oceans
slightly more neutral (or less alkaline), they could not even come close
to making the oceans actually neutral, let alone acidic.

Further, **[[realistic changes]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in pH of 0.1,
0.2, and 0.3 [are]{.mark} relatively]{.underline}
[**[small]{.underline}** [compared with the]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[changes]{.mark} that marine [species deal with on]{.mark}
a]{.underline} **[[regular ba]{.mark}sis]{.underline}**. For example,
"**[[upwelling events]{.underline}]{.mark}**"---[the movement of large
water masses from great depths of the ocean to the ocean
surface]{.underline}---[can]{.underline} **[[drastically
change]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[pH]{.underline}]{.mark}** levels
[and]{.underline} **[temperatures]{.underline}** an organism is
subjected to. And **[empirical]{.underline}** [experiments
show]{.underline} that [many species even]{.underline}
**[benefit]{.underline}** [from the change]{.underline}.\[22\]

[Changes in average [pH]{.mark} levels in oceans are much like changes
in average temperatures on land. They are]{.underline}
**[[not]{.underline}]{.mark}** changes [from [one]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[static state]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to]{.underline}
**[another]{.underline}** [but rather]{.underline} relatively **[small
shifts]{.underline}** [from one]{.underline} **[wide
range]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} **[another]{.underline}**.

[There is]{.underline} **[no chance that the scale of changes we're
talking about could lead to some global ocean die-off]{.underline}**.
Indeed, [the [most]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[fertile waters]{.mark} in
the world]{.underline}** [[have]{.mark} some of the]{.underline}
**[[lowest pH]{.underline}]{.mark}** levels.\[23\]

The fear of a global ocean die-off can come only from the dogma that the
oceans are a delicate nurturer---a delicate, stable system where
everything either lives in a perfect balance or dies.

Given the actual evidence about the impacts of ocean neutralization, the
truth is that . . .

No Possible Negative Change in the Ocean Is Going to Be Significant
Enough to Even Offset the Benefits of CO2 on Land-Based Life, Let Alone
the Benefits of Global Empowerment

Recall our knowledge system's disinterest in the fertilizer effect of
rising CO2 levels on land, which leads to more raw biological material
around the globe and contributes massively to crop growth and therefore
our nourishment.

But when there's a chance that rising CO2 levels will affect some life
in the ocean somewhat negatively, as in the case of ocean
neutralization, then it's the subject of intense interest and
hand-wringing.

But from a human flourishing perspective it makes much more sense to
prioritize land-based life over ocean life.

Consider: What values are at stake with declines in certain forms of
ocean life? One thing that can decline is wild fishing. Another thing
that can decline is tourism for areas with coral reefs that are harmed
or destroyed.

Wild fishing and tourism in reef areas are values, but they are not
values on the level of global greening from rising CO2---let alone
billions of people having the opportunity to survive and flourish, which
is the value we get from continuing fossil fuel use.

Recall Bill McKibben's statement that ocean "acidification" is, "by
itself, enough reason to get off fossil fuel."\[24\] McKibben is willing
to disempower the world, impoverishing and endangering everyone, in the
name of unimpacted oceans. That is the murderous anti-impact framework
at work.

In addition to wildly distorting the impacts of ocean neutralization,
our knowledge system denies the phenomenon that time and again offsets
negatives in any and every realm: fossil-fueled environmental mastery.

There Is a Significant Ability to Master the Oceans That Is Being
Dismissed

[If lowering the pH of oceans **is**]{.underline} [causing any kind of
problem to marine life we care about, we should be thinking of ways to
use our]{.underline} intelligence and [abilities to change the oceans
for the]{.underline} **[better]{.underline}**---[whether to]{.underline}
**[directly affect pH]{.underline}** [or to offset any pH]{.underline}
