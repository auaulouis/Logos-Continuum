[The [Arctic]{.mark} has been [warming four times faster than the rest
of]{.mark} the [globe]{.mark}.]{.underline} This phenomenon, aptly named
[['Arctic amplification,]{.mark}' is [caused by diminishing sea ice,
warmer water]{.mark} flowing into the region from lower latitudes, and
warmer [air]{.mark} that holds more heat and moisture.]{.underline}1
Because of this accelerated warming, the [[changes]{.mark} to the Arctic
and its environment have been [more]{.mark} [extreme and]{.mark} are
[quickly developing]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Greenland ice sheet, the
largest ice mass in the northern hemisphere, is melting rapidly, and
snow coverage during the winter season throughout the region is
decreasing.2 [[Areas]{.mark} once deemed [too remote]{.mark} are
[becoming]{.mark} increasingly [accessible]{.mark}]{.underline}. There
are now more opportunities for scientific research, alternative
transportation routes, economic development, and energy policy in the
Arctic. 3 As Arctic amplification continues, the [[potential for mineral
mining]{.mark} has [increased the Arctic's strategic importance]{.mark},
making it more accessible and [attracting]{.mark} more
[stakeholders]{.mark}]{.underline}. 4 The Arctic has become a focal
point for countries to secure their resources for future demands, with a
renewed focus on the seabed of the deep sea. 5 [In light of this, five
[Arctic]{.mark} coastal [states, Canada, Denmark, Norway]{.mark}, the
[Russian]{.mark} Federation, [and]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates of America have [pledged]{.mark}, through the Ilulissat
Declaration, [to commit]{.mark} to continuous [cooperation to
"ensure]{.mark} the [protection and preservation of the fragile marine
environment of the Arctic Ocean]{.mark}]{.underline}." 6 As states look
for resource availability in the near and far future, [[t]{.mark}he
[deep seabed]{.mark} is becoming [more appealing for extraction]{.mark},
especially [within]{.mark} the [context of energy]{.mark}
security]{.underline}.7 These resources are essential for the
clean-energy transition as their demand may increase fivefold and
require billions of tons of metals, partly driven by the need for
batteries for electric vehicles.8 [The [three main]{.mark} resource
[types]{.mark} currently being evaluated for exploitation [are sulfide
deposits, polymetallic nodules, and cobalt-rich ferromanganese
crusts]{.mark}, all [found in abundance]{.mark} on the deep-seabed.9
[Valuable exotic metals]{.mark} such as [platinum, tellurium,
and]{.mark} other [rare earth minerals]{.mark} can also be
extracted.]{.underline} 10 These [minerals are [**considered essential**
to shift]{.mark} the world [from fossil fuels into renewable]{.mark}
resources, a phenomenon [known as the green
transition]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Deep sea resources are higher quality and more accessible than terrestrial minerals.

I. THE DESIRE FOR AND POTENTIAL LIMITS TO DEEP-SEA MINING A. Minerals
Worth Mining for Manganese, cobalt, lithium, and copper are [[rare-earth
metals]{.underline}]{.mark} and [are [essential]{.mark}
[components]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the [battery-powered
technologies]{.mark}, [such as cellphones and
laptops]{.mark}]{.underline}, that underpin modern, information-driven
economies.21 These same rare-earth metals **[are also needed to produce
batteries]{.underline}** to power [[electric
cars]{.underline}]{.mark}.22 Similarly, molybdenum, platinum, and
tellurium are rare-earth metals that are **[key components of thin-film,
high-efficiency photovoltaic cells]{.underline}** used in [[solar
panel]{.mark}s and [magnets]{.mark} needed for [other renewable energy
sources.]{.mark} 23 Because these [green energy technologies]{.mark}
also [require]{.mark} [batteries]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [store]{.mark}
[energy]{.mark} when the sun is not shining, the [demand]{.mark} for
cobalt, lithium, and manganese [will]{.mark} likely [rise]{.mark}
[even]{.mark} [further]{.mark}.24 For example, energy storage
requirements may drive the [annual]{.mark} [demand]{.mark} [for]{.mark}
[cobalt]{.mark} in [2050]{.mark} [up]{.mark} [450]{.mark}
[percent]{.mark} [from]{.mark} its [2018]{.mark}]{.underline} level.25
This ["green demand" for rare minerals]{.underline} will [build upon the
previous interest and investment in mining precious minerals for
technology and jewelry]{.underline}.26

Due to [[depleting land deposits]{.mark}, [inefficient recycling]{.mark}
of existing products containing these minerals, and the [increasing
demand for minerals]{.mark}, [interest]{.mark} [in]{.mark}
[mining]{.mark} the [deep seafloor]{.mark} is
[rising]{.mark}]{.underline}.27 **[Recent technological developments are
making deep-sea mining feasible for the first time.]{.underline}**28 In
addition, the [[grade]{.mark} [of]{.mark} some [minerals]{.mark}, such
as copper, cobalt, nickel, and gold, in the deep sea may be
[substantially higher than terrestrial sources of]{.mark} the [same
mineral]{.mark}.29 If high]{.underline}-quality, **[[deep-sea]{.mark}
minerals become [more accessible]{.mark} as renewable technology
increases their demand]{.underline}**, [[mining]{.mark} operations will
[become economically feasible]{.mark}]{.underline}.30 Because these
lucrative mineral deposits exist in vulnerable, remote ecosystems under
international waters with historically no governance, the legal
framework that regulates their extraction will be critical to ensure
operations are sustainable.31

B. The Deep Sea The deep sea and seafloor, all areas below 200 meters of
seawater, are some of the least explored and understood ecosystems
remaining on Earth.32 Because much of the ocean floor is under more than
3,000 meters of water, human exploration of these areas only became
possible with recent technological advances.33 Even now, roughly 80
percent of the global ocean is unexplored.34 Little data on the
biodiversity and genetic connectivity of ecosystems in these
environments are available, but the data that do exist suggest that,
contrary to expectations, unique life forms can exist at these depths.35
Despite the total absence of sunlight, limited food supply, and low
metabolic rates from high water pressure and low temperature, diverse
life forms and reproductive strategies have evolved to survive in or
near the ocean floor.36 Hydrothermal vents along geologic boundaries are
an exception to this paradigm---the high temperatures and unique
chemistry that result from the interaction of cold, deep seawater and
volcanic magma create novel and extremely productive ecosystems
thousands of meters beneath the ocean surface.37 [[Exploration]{.mark}
of the deep sea has not only [discovered]{.mark} this life, but also
[large amounts of lucrative, rare metals]{.mark}]{.underline} like
cobalt, manganese, and copper, **[which are increasingly [scarce on
land]{.mark}]{.underline}**.38

#### Climate change causes extinction from a confluence of factors.

[Observed Changes and Impacts]{.underline}

A.2 [**[Widespread]{.mark} and [rapid changes]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the
**[atmosphere]{.mark}, [ocean]{.mark}, [cryosphere and
biosphere]{.mark}** have occurred. **Human-caused climate change** is
already [affecting]{.mark} many weather and climate extremes in [every
region]{.mark} across the globe.]{.underline} This has led to
[**widespread adverse impacts** and related losses and damages to nature
and people (]{.underline}high confidence). Vulnerable communities who
have historically contributed the least to current climate change are
disproportionately affected (high confidence). {2.1, Table 2.1, Figure
2.2, Figure 2.3} (Figure SPM.1)

A.2.1 It is **[[unequivocal]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [[human
influence]{.mark} has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and
land]{.underline}. Global mean sea level increased by 0.20 \[0.15 to
0.25\] m between 1901 and 2018. The average rate of sea level rise was
1.3 \[0.6 to 2.1\] mm yr-1 between 1901 and 1971, increasing to 1.9
\[0.8 to 2.9\] mm yr-1 between 1971 and 2006, and further increasing to
3.7 \[3.2 to 4.2\] mm yr-1 between 2006 and 2018 (high confidence).
Human influence was very likely the main driver of these increases since
at least 1971. [**[Evidence of observed changes]{.mark} in extremes**
[such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts,]{.mark} and [tropical
cyclones]{.mark}, and, in particular, their attribution to human
influence, has further strengthened since AR5.]{.underline} Human
influence has likely increased the chance of compound extreme events
since the 1950s, including increases in the frequency of concurrent
heatwaves and droughts (high confidence). {2.1.2, Table 2.1, Figure 2.3,
Figure 3.4} (Figure SPM.1)

A.2.2 Approximately **[3.3 to [3.6 billion people]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[live in contexts that are **highly [vulnerable]{.mark}** to climate
change]{.underline}. Human and ecosystem vulnerability are
interdependent. Regions and people with considerable development
constraints have high vulnerability to climatic hazards. [Increasing
weather and [climate]{.mark} extreme [events]{.mark} have [exposed
**millions of people** to]{.mark} acute [food]{.mark} insecurity12
[and]{.mark} reduced [water security]{.mark},]{.underline} with the
largest adverse impacts observed [[in]{.mark} many locations and/or
communities in **[Africa]{.mark}**, **[Asia]{.mark}**,
**[Central]{.mark} [and South America]{.mark}**, **[LDCs]{.mark}**,
**[Small Islands]{.mark}** and **[the Arctic]{.mark}**, and globally for
**[Indigenous Peoples]{.mark}**, small-scale **[food producers]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} **[low-income households]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Between
2010 and 2020, [[human mortality from floods, droughts and storms was
**15 times higher**]{.mark} in highly vulnerable regions,]{.underline}
compared to regions with very low vulnerability. (high confidence)
{2.1.2, 4.4} (Figure SPM.1)

A.2.3 [[Climate change]{.mark} has [caused **substantial damages**,
and]{.mark} increasingly **[irreversible losses]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[[in]{.mark} [terrestrial]{.mark}, [freshwater]{.mark},
[cryospheric]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} [coastal]{.mark} and open [ocean
ecosystems]{.mark}]{.underline} (high confidence). [**[Hundreds]{.mark}
[of local losses of]{.mark} [species]{.mark}** have been driven by
increases in the magnitude of heat extremes]{.underline} (high
confidence) [[with **mass mortality events**]{.mark} recorded on land
and in the ocean]{.underline} (very high confidence). Impacts on some
ecosystems are approaching irreversibility such as the impacts of
hydrological changes resulting from the retreat of glaciers, or the
changes in some mountain (medium confidence) and Arctic ecosystems
driven by permafrost thaw (high confidence). {2.1.2, Figure 2.3} (Figure
SPM.1)

A.2.4 [Climate change has [reduced food]{.mark} security [and]{.mark}
affected [water security]{.mark},]{.underline} hindering efforts to meet
Sustainable Development Goals (high confidence). Although overall
agricultural productivity has increased, [climate change has
[slowed]{.mark} this [growth]{.mark} over the past 50 years
globally]{.underline} (medium confidence), with related negative impacts
mainly in midand low latitude regions but positive impacts in some high
latitude regions (high confidence). [[Ocean warming and ocean
acidification]{.mark} have adversely [affected]{.mark} food production
from [fisheries]{.mark} and shellfish aquaculture in some oceanic
regions]{.underline} (high confidence). Roughly **[[half of the world's
population]{.underline}]{.mark}** [currently experience severe water
scarcity for at least part of the year due to a combination of climatic
and non-climatic drivers]{.underline} (medium confidence). {2.1.2,
Figure 2.3} (Figure SPM.1)

A.2.5 In all regions increases in [**[extreme heat events]{.mark}** have
[resulted in]{.mark} human [mortality]{.mark} and morbidity]{.underline}
(very high confidence). The [[occurrence of climate]{.mark}-related
food-borne and water-borne [diseases]{.mark}]{.underline} (very high
confidence) and the incidence of vector-borne diseases (high confidence)
[[have **increased**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In assessed regions, [some
**[mental health challenges]{.mark}** are associated with increasing
temperatures]{.underline} (high confidence), [**[trauma]{.mark}** from
extreme events]{.underline} (very high confidence), and **[[loss of
livelihoods and culture]{.underline}]{.mark}** (high confidence).
Climate and weather extremes are increasingly [driving
**[displacement]{.mark}** in Africa, Asia, North America]{.underline}
(high confidence), and Central and South America (medium confidence),
with small island states in the Caribbean and South Pacific being
disproportionately affected relative to their small population size
(high confidence). {2.1.2, Figure 2.3} (Figure SPM.1)

A.2.6 [Climate change has caused widespread adverse impacts and related
losses and damages13 to nature and people that are unequally distributed
across systems, regions and sectors]{.underline}. [**[Economic
damages]{.mark}** from climate change have been detected [in]{.mark}
climate-exposed [sectors]{.mark}, [such as]{.mark}
**[agriculture]{.mark}**, **[forestry]{.mark}**, **[fishery]{.mark}**,
**[energy]{.mark}**, [and **tourism**]{.mark}. Individual livelihoods
have been affected through, for example, **[destruction of homes]{.mark}
and infrastructure**, and **[loss of property]{.mark} and income**,
**[human health]{.mark} and food security**, with adverse effects on
gender and social equity.]{.underline} (high confidence) {2.1.2} (Figure
SPM.1)

A.2.7 In urban areas, observed climate change has caused adverse impacts
on human health, livelihoods and key infrastructure. Hot extremes have
intensified in cities. Urban infrastructure, including transportation,
water, sanitation and energy systems have been compromised by extreme
and slow-onset events14, with resulting economic losses, disruptions of
services and negative impacts to well-being. Observed adverse impacts
are concentrated amongst economically and socially marginalised urban
residents. (high confidence) {2.1.2}

Current Progress in Adaptation and Gaps and Challenges

A.3 Adaptation planning and implementation has progressed across all
sectors and regions, with documented benefits and varying effectiveness.
[Despite progress, **[adaptation gaps exist]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and
will continue to grow at current rates of implementation. Hard and soft
limits to adaptation have been reached in some ecosystems and regions.
Maladaptation is happening in some sectors and regions. Current global
financial flows for adaptation are insufficient for, and constrain
implementation of, adaptation options, especially in developing
countries (high confidence). {2.2, 2.3}

A.3.1 Progress in adaptation planning and implementation has been
observed across all sectors and regions, generating multiple benefits
(very high confidence). Growing public and political awareness of
climate impacts and risks has resulted in at least 170 countries and
many cities including adaptation in their climate policies and planning
processes (high confidence). {2.2.3}

A.3.2 Effectiveness15 of adaptation in reducing climate risks16 is
documented for specific contexts, sectors and regions (high confidence).
Examples of effective adaptation options include: cultivar improvements,
on-farm water management and storage, soil moisture conservation,
irrigation, agroforestry, community-based adaptation, farm and landscape
level diversification in agriculture, sustainable land management
approaches, use of agroecological principles and practices and other
approaches that work with natural processes (high confidence).
Ecosystem-based adaptation17 approaches such as urban greening,
restoration of wetlands and upstream forest ecosystems have been
effective in reducing flood risks and urban heat (high confidence).
Combinations of non-structural measures like early warning systems and
structural measures like levees have reduced loss of lives in case of
inland flooding (medium confidence). Adaptation options such as disaster
risk management, early warning systems, climate services and social
safety nets have broad applicability across multiple sectors (high
confidence). {2.2.3}

A.3.3 Most observed adaptation responses are fragmented, incremental18,
sector-specific and unequally distributed across regions. Despite
progress, adaptation gaps exist across sectors and regions, and will
continue to grow under current levels of implementation, with the
largest adaptation gaps among lower income groups. (high confidence)
{2.3.2}

A.3.4 There is increased evidence of maladaptation in various sectors
and regions. Maladaptation especially affects marginalised and
vulnerable groups adversely. (high confidence) {2.3.2}

A.3.5 Soft limits to adaptation are currently being experienced by
small-scale farmers and households along some lowlying coastal areas
(medium confidence) resulting from financial, governance, institutional
and policy constraints (high confidence). Some tropical, coastal, polar
and mountain ecosystems have reached hard adaptation limits (high
confidence). Adaptation does not prevent all losses and damages, even
with effective adaptation and before reaching soft and hard limits (high
confidence). {2.3.2}

Current Mitigation Progress, Gaps and Challenges

A.4 Policies and laws addressing mitigation have consistently expanded
since AR5. Global GHG emissions in 2030 implied by nationally determined
contributions (NDCs) announced by October 2021 make it likely that
warming will exceed 1.5°C during the 21st century and make it harder to
limit warming below 2°C. There are gaps between projected emissions from
implemented policies and those from NDCs and finance flows fall short of
the levels needed to meet climate goals across all sectors and regions.
(high confidence) {2.2, 2.3, Figure 2.5, Table 2.2}

A.4.1 The UNFCCC, Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement are supporting
rising levels of national ambition. The Paris Agreement, adopted under
the UNFCCC, with near universal participation, has led to policy
development and target-setting at national and sub-national levels, in
particular in relation to mitigation, as well as enhanced transparency
of climate action and support (medium confidence). Many regulatory and
economic instruments have already been deployed successfully (high
confidence). In many countries, policies have enhanced energy
efficiency, reduced rates of deforestation and accelerated technology
deployment, leading to avoided and in some cases reduced or removed
emissions (high confidence). Multiple lines of evidence suggest that
mitigation policies have led to several24 Gt CO2-eq yr-1 of avoided
global emissions (medium confidence). At least 18 countries have
sustained absolute production-based GHG and consumption-based CO2
reductions25 for longer than 10 years. These reductions have only partly
offset global emissions growth (high confidence). {2.2.1, 2.2.2}

A.4.2 Several mitigation options, notably solar energy, wind energy,
electrification of urban systems, urban green infrastructure, energy
efficiency, demand-side management, improved forest and crop/grassland
management, and reduced food waste and loss, are technically viable, are
becoming increasingly cost effective and are generally supported by the
public. From 2010 to 2019 there have been sustained decreases in the
unit costs of solar energy (85%), wind energy (55%), and lithium-ion
batteries (85%), and large increases in their deployment, e.g., \>10×
for solar and \>100× for electric vehicles (EVs), varying widely across
regions. The mix of policy instruments that reduced costs and stimulated
adoption includes public R&D, funding for demonstration and pilot
projects, and demand-pull instruments such as deployment subsidies to
attain scale. Maintaining emission-intensive systems may, in some
regions and sectors, be more expensive than transitioning to low
emission systems. (high confidence) {2.2.2, Figure 2.4}

A.4.3 A substantial 'emissions gap' exists between global GHG emissions
in 2030 associated with the implementation of NDCs announced prior to
COP2626 and those associated with modelled mitigation pathways that
limit warming to 1.5°C (\>50%) with no or limited overshoot or limit
warming to 2°C (\>67%) assuming immediate action (high confidence). This
would make it likely that warming will exceed 1.5°C during the 21st
century (high confidence). Global modelled mitigation pathways that
limit warming to 1.5°C (\>50%) with no or limited overshoot or limit
warming to 2°C (\>67%) assuming immediate action imply deep global GHG
emissions reductions this decade (high confidence) (see SPM Box 1, Table
1, B.6)27. Modelled pathways that are consistent with NDCs announced
prior to COP26 until 2030 and assume no increase in ambition thereafter
have higher emissions, leading to a median global warming of 2.8 \[2.1
to 3.4\] °C by 2100 (medium confidence). Many countries have signalled
an intention to achieve net zero GHG or net zero CO2 by around
mid-century but pledges differ across countries in terms of scope and
specificity, and limited policies are to date in place to deliver on
them. {2.3.1, Table 2.2, Figure 2.5, Table 3.1, 4.1}

A.4.4 Policy coverage is uneven across sectors (high confidence).
Policies implemented by the end of 2020 are projected to result in
higher global GHG emissions in 2030 than emissions implied by NDCs,
indicating an 'implementation gap' (high confidence). Without a
strengthening of policies, global warming of 3.2 \[2.2 to 3.5\] °C is
projected by 2100 (medium confidence). {2.2.2, 2.3.1, 3.1.1, Figure 2.5}
(Box SPM.1, Figure SPM.5)

A.4.5 The adoption of low-emission technologies lags in most developing
countries, particularly least developed ones, due in part to limited
finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity (medium
confidence). The magnitude of climate finance flows has increased over
the last decade and financing channels have broadened but growth has
slowed since 2018 (high confidence). Financial flows have developed
heterogeneously across regions and sectors (high confidence). Public and
private finance flows for fossil fuels are still greater than those for
climate adaptation and mitigation (high confidence). The overwhelming
majority of tracked climate finance is directed towards mitigation, but
nevertheless falls short of the levels needed to limit warming to below
2°C or to 1.5°C across all sectors and regions (see C7.2) (very high
confidence). In 2018, public and publicly mobilised private climate
finance flows from developed to developing countries were below the
collective goal under the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement to mobilise USD 100
billion per year by 2020 in the context of meaningful mitigation action
and transparency on implementation (medium confidence). {2.2.2, 2.3.1,
2.3.3}

Future Climate Change

B.1 Continued greenhouse gas emissions will lead to increasing global
warming, with the best estimate of reaching 1.5°C in the near term in
considered scenarios and modelled pathways. Every increment of global
warming will intensify multiple and concurrent hazards (high
confidence). Deep, rapid, and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas
emissions would lead to a discernible slowdown in global warming within
around two decades, and also to discernible changes in atmospheric
composition within a few years (high confidence). {Cross-Section Boxes 1
and 2, 3.1, 3.3, Table 3.1, Figure 3.1, 4.3} (Figure SPM.2, Box SPM.1)

B.1.1 Global warming28 will continue to increase in the near term
(2021--2040) mainly due to increased cumulative CO2 emissions in nearly
all considered scenarios and modelled pathways. In the near term, global
warming is more likely than not to reach 1.5°C even under the very low
GHG emission scenario (SSP1-1.9) and likely or very likely to exceed
1.5°C under higher emissions scenarios. In the considered scenarios and
modelled pathways, the best estimates of the time when the level of
global warming of 1.5°C is reached lie in the near term29. Global
warming declines back to below 1.5°C by the end of the 21st century in
some scenarios and modelled pathways (see B.7). The assessed climate
response to GHG emissions scenarios results in a best estimate of
warming for 2081--2100 that spans a range from 1.4°C for a very low GHG
emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9) to 2.7°C for an intermediate GHG emissions
scenario (SSP2-4.5) and 4.4°C for a very high GHG emissions scenario
(SSP5-8.5)30, with narrower uncertainty ranges31 than for corresponding
scenarios in AR5. {Cross-Section Boxes 1 and 2, 3.1.1, 3.3.4, Table 3.1,
4.3} (Box SPM.1)

B.1.2 Discernible differences in trends of global surface temperature
between contrasting GHG emissions scenarios (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6 vs.
SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5) would begin to emerge from natural variability32
within around 20 years. Under these contrasting scenarios, discernible
effects would emerge within years for GHG concentrations, and sooner for
air quality improvements, due to the combined targeted air pollution
controls and strong and sustained methane emissions reductions. Targeted
reductions of air pollutant emissions lead to more rapid improvements in
air quality within years compared to reductions in GHG emissions only,
but in the long term, further improvements are projected in scenarios
that combine efforts to reduce air pollutants as well as GHG
emissions33. (high confidence) {3.1.1} (Box SPM.1)

B.1.3 Continued emissions will further affect all major climate system
components. With every additional increment of global warming, changes
in extremes continue to become larger. Continued global warming is
projected to further intensify the global water cycle, including its
variability, global monsoon precipitation, and very wet and very dry
weather and climate events and seasons (high confidence). In scenarios
with increasing CO2 emissions, natural land and ocean carbon sinks are
projected to take up a decreasing proportion of these emissions (high
confidence). Other projected changes include further reduced extents
and/or volumes of almost all cryospheric elements34 (high confidence),
further global mean sea level rise (virtually certain), and increased
ocean acidification (virtually certain) and deoxygenation (high
confidence). {3.1.1, 3.3.1, Figure 3.4} (Figure SPM.2)

B.1.4 With further warming, every region is projected to increasingly
experience concurrent and multiple changes in climatic impact-drivers.
Compound heatwaves and droughts are projected to become more frequent,
including concurrent events across multiple locations (high confidence).
Due to relative sea level rise, current 1-in-100 year extreme sea level
events are projected to occur at least annually in more than half of all
tide gauge locations by 2100 under all considered scenarios (high
confidence). Other projected regional changes include intensification of
tropical cyclones and/or extratropical storms (medium confidence), and
increases in aridity and fire weather (medium to high confidence).
{3.1.1, 3.1.3}

B.1.5 Natural variability will continue to modulate human-caused climate
changes, either attenuating or amplifying projected changes, with little
effect on centennial-scale global warming (high confidence). These
modulations are important to consider in adaptation planning, especially
at the regional scale and in the near term. If a large explosive
volcanic eruption were to occur35, it would temporarily and partially
mask human-caused climate change by reducing global surface temperature
and precipitation for one to three years (medium confidence). {4.3}

Climate Change Impacts and Climate-Related Risks

B.2 For any given future warming level, [many climate-related [risks are
**higher than assessed**]{.mark} in AR5, and projected long-term impacts
are up to **[multiple times higher]{.mark}** than currently

warming]{.underline} (very high confidence). Climatic and non-climatic
risks will increasingly interact, creating compound and cascading risks
that are more complex and difficult to manage (high confidence).

B.2.1 In the near term, **[[every region]{.mark} in the world is
[projected to face further]{.mark} increases in climate
[hazards]{.mark}]{.underline}** (medium to high confidence, depending on

associated risks expected in the near term include an increase in
**[heat-related human mortality and morbidity]{.underline}** (high

[changes]{.mark} in floods, landslides, and water availability have the
potential to [lead to **severe consequences**]{.mark} for people,

heavy precipitation (high confidence) will increase rain-generated local
flooding (medium confidence). {Figure 3.2, Figure 3.3, 4.3, Figure 4.3}
(Figure SPM.3, Figure SPM.4)

B.2.[2 Risks and projected adverse impacts and related losses and
damages from climate change will escalate with every increment of global
warming]{.underline} (very high confidence). They are higher for global
warming of 1.5°C than at present, and even higher at 2°C (high
confidence). Compared to the AR5, global aggregated risk levels37
(Reasons for Concern38) are assessed to become high to very high at
lower levels of global warming due to recent evidence of observed
impacts, improved process understanding, and new knowledge on exposure
and vulnerability of human and natural systems, including limits to
adaptation (high confidence). [Due to unavoidable sea level
rise]{.underline} (see also B.3), [risks for coastal ecosystems, people
and infrastructure will continue to increase beyond 2100]{.underline}
(high confidence). {3.1.2, 3.1.3, Figure 3.4, Figure 4.3} (Figure SPM.3,

B.2.3 With further warming, [[climate change]{.mark} risks will become
[**increasingly complex and more difficult** to
manage]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Multiple climatic and non-climatic risk
drivers will interact, resulting in [compounding]{.mark} overall [risk
and]{.mark} risks [cascading across sectors]{.mark} and
regions]{.underline}. [Climate-driven food insecurity and supply
instability, for example, are projected to increase with increasing
global warming, interacting with non-climatic risk [drivers such as

confidence) {3.1.2, 4.3, Figure 4.3}

B.2.4 [For any given warming level, the level of risk will also depend
on trends in vulnerability and exposure of humans and
ecosystems]{.underline}. Future exposure to climatic hazards is
increasing globally due to socio-economic development trends including
migration, growing inequality and urbanisation. Human vulnerability will
concentrate in informal settlements and rapidly growing smaller
settlements. In rural areas vulnerability will be heightened by high
reliance on climatesensitive livelihoods. Vulnerability of ecosystems
will be strongly influenced by past, present, and future patterns of
unsustainable consumption and production, increasing demographic
pressures, and persistent unsustainable use and management of land,
ocean, and water. [[Loss of ecosystems]{.mark} and their services has
[cascading]{.mark} and long-term impacts on people globally, [especially
for Indigenous Peoples and local communities]{.mark} who are directly
dependent on ecosystems to meet basic needs.]{.underline} (high
confidence) {Cross-Section Box.2 Figure 1c, 3.1.2, 4.3}

Likelihood and Risks of Unavoidable, Irreversible or Abrupt Changes

B.3 Some future changes are unavoidable and/or irreversible but can be
limited by deep, rapid, and sustained global greenhouse gas emissions
reduction. The likelihood of abrupt and/or irreversible changes
increases with higher global warming levels. Similarly, the probability
of low-likelihood outcomes associated with potentially very large
adverse impacts increases with higher global warming levels. (high
confidence) {3.1}

B.3.1 Limiting global surface temperature does not prevent continued
changes in climate system components that have multi-decadal or longer
timescales of response (high confidence). Sea level rise is unavoidable
for centuries to millennia due to continuing deep ocean warming and ice
sheet melt, and sea levels will remain elevated for thousands of years
(high confidence). However, deep, rapid, and sustained GHG emissions
reductions would limit further sea level rise acceleration and projected
long-term sea level rise commitment. Relative to 1995--2014, the likely
global mean sea level rise under the SSP1-1.9 GHG emissions scenario is
0.15--0.23 m by 2050 and 0.28--0.55 m by 2100; while for the SSP5-8.5
GHG emissions scenario it is 0.20--0.29 m by 2050 and 0.63--1.01 m by
2100 (medium confidence). Over the next 2000 years, global mean sea
level will rise by about 2--3 m if warming is limited to 1.5°C and 2--6
m if limited to 2°C (low confidence). {3.1.3, Figure 3.4} (Box SPM.1)

B.3.2 The likelihood and impacts of abrupt and/or irreversible changes
in the climate system, including changes triggered when tipping points
are reached, increase with further global warming (high confidence).
[[As warming]{.mark} levels [increase]{.mark}, [so do]{.mark} the [risks
of species extinction or irreversible **loss of biodiversity**]{.mark}
in ecosystems [including]{.mark} **[forests]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(medium confidence), **[[coral reefs]{.mark}]{.underline}** (very high
confidence) **[[and in Arctic]{.mark} regions]{.underline}** (high
confidence). At sustained warming levels between 2°C and 3°C, the
Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets will be lost almost completely
and irreversibly over multiple millennia, causing several metres of sea
level rise (limited evidence). The probability and rate of ice mass loss
increase with higher global surface temperatures (high confidence).
{3.1.2, 3.1.3}

B.3.3 The probability of low-likelihood outcomes associated with
potentially very large impacts increases with higher global warming
levels (high confidence). Due to deep uncertainty linked to ice-sheet
processes, global mean sea level rise above the likely range --
approaching 2 m by 2100 and in excess of 15 m by 2300 under the very
high GHG emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5) (low confidence) -- cannot be
excluded. [There is medium confidence that the **[A]{.mark}tlantic
[M]{.mark}eridional [O]{.mark}verturning [C]{.mark}irculation** will not
[collapse]{.mark} abruptly before 2100, but if it were to occur, it
would very likely cause **abrupt [shifts]{.mark} in regional
[weather]{.mark} patterns**, [and **large impacts**]{.mark} **on

**[[Key considerations for investors]{.underline}]{.mark}** in this
sector include:

[[Licensing and project structuring]{.underline}]{.mark}: Understanding
how deep sea mining will be licensed, the authority of a country or the
ISA to issue those licences [and ensuring the project [has been
de-risked against]{.mark} legal and **[compliance
challenges.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[Bankability and risk allocation: [**Addressing uncertainty** in the

appropriately manage compliance responsibilities]{.underline}, provide
for an acceptable allocation of the technology risk, and contain
adequate dispute settlement mechanisms for these complex cross border
projects.

#### The US is key to spur global action on climate change

Sue **Biniaz '21** \[State Department's Principal Deputy Special Envoy
for Climate.  As the lead climate lawyer for the United States from 1989

SC

Historically speaking, there is [[no doubt]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates has
[[played a leading]{.underline}]{.mark}, consequential [[role]{.mark}
[in shaping global action on climate]{.mark}]{.underline}. Extraordinary
State Department teams across multiple administrations have shown the
best of what the U.S. has to offer in three important ways:

First, [U.S. [negotiators have played]{.mark}]{.underline} a [[singular
role]{.mark} in]{.underline} conceptualizing and
[[advancing]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[framework for]{.mark} [global
action]{.mark}]{.underline}. State [[hosted]{.mark} the first round of
[negotiations]{.mark}]{.underline} that [led to]{.underline} the 1992
[[U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations Framework [Convention on
Climate]{.mark} Change.]{.underline} And the [[U.S. climate
team]{.underline}]{.mark} has been [[hard at work]{.mark} ever since.
[No country]{.mark} [was more influential in]{.mark} designing
the]{.underline} paradigm-shifting [[Paris
Agreement]{.underline}]{.mark}, with its science-based [temperature
limitation goal]{.underline}, [emissions commitments that are nationally
determined,]{.underline} and a nuanced approach that attracted global
participation. And we have [[played a critical role in shaping
agreements]{.mark} and decision]{.underline}s, in this forum as well as
others, that are setting the direction for decades to come.

Second, the [[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has [led
efforts]{.mark}]{.underline} to [[build]{.mark} out a [network of
multilateral alliances]{.mark}]{.underline}, platforms, and partnerships
to deliver on ever-evolving climate goals. These [[include]{.mark}
bodies like the [Climate and Clean Air Coalition]{.mark},]{.underline}
which works to address short-lived climate pollutants; the Clean Energy
Ministerial; the Systematic Observations Financing Facility, which works
to expand access to climate data; and the Forest and Climate Leaders'
Partnership.

#### U.S. has alternate pathways that give domestic departments the authority to issue deep sea mining licenses.

**Gimbals 25** \[April 11, 2025; A company that provides intelligence,
investigations, and information operations solutions for statecraft,
national security, and law enforcement;
https://3gimbals.com/insights/underwater-natural-resources-the-next-strategic-frontier-for-u-s-leadership/\]//sarah

[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates famously [has not ratified UNCLOS,
despite being largely compliant]{.mark} with most of its provisions as
customary international law]{.underline}. This non-party status means
the U.S. is not a member of the ISA and has no vote on the Council.
However, the U.S. does participate as an observer and has considerable
influence informally through American scientists, legal experts, and
allies. Historically, even as a non-party, the U.S. has observed ISA
decisions and refrained from undercutting them to respect international
law.

[[In light of this, the U.S.]{.mark} government [has been preparing
alternative pathways]{.mark}. The Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act
(**[DSHMRA]{.mark}) [gives the Commerce Department authority to issue
licenses for deep-sea mining to U.S. firms, even in international areas,
through NOAA]{.mark}**. Until now, this [law was
dormant]{.mark}---largely because the U.S. preferred to wait for the ISA
process.]{.underline}

[[But that may be changing]{.underline}]{.mark}. With the
Administration's [[March 2025]{.mark} drafting of an [executive order to
jump-start deep-sea mining by using the U.S. licensing
process]{.mark}]{.underline}, the U.S. may [[effectively side-step the
ISA]{.underline}.]{.mark} The draft order reportedly indicates the [U.S.
will [exercise its rights to extract critical minerals]{.mark} on the
ocean's floor [and let miners proceed under NOAA
oversight.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The [Metals Company has **[already formally requested such U.S.
permits]{.mark}**]{.underline}, frustrated with what it calls ISA
foot-dragging. Should the U.S. grant a license in an ISA-designated
area, it could be seen as a bold assertion of American freedom of
action.

#### U.S DSM is legal under UNCLOS, requires EIA, and past exploration thumps.

U.S.C. §§4321-4347) is the source of the substantive requirements for

1984, NOAA issued exploration licenses for four sites located in the
CCZ, predating the establishment of the ISA in 1994.^58^ NOAA has not
issued any exploration licenses since 1984, although the agency has
approved extension requests[. To date, [two exploration licenses]{.mark}
(USA-1 and USA-4), both held by Lockheed Martin, [remain **active
pursuant** to DSHMRA and in effect]{.mark} through June 2,
2027]{.underline} (Figure 2).59 As of April 25, 2025, NOAA has not
issued commercial recovery permits under DSHMRA. Commercial recovery
permits issued by NOAA may not be recognized by parties to UNCLOS, and
it is possible the ISA could issue exploitation contracts to a company
sponsored by a nation party to UNCLOS in the same area.^60^ Without the
United States being a party to UNCLOS, U.S. citizens issued licenses or
permits by NOAA would have no legal recourse under UNCLOS mechanisms to
protect their claim to explore and/or recover seabed minerals in ANBJ.

### Plan

#### The United States federal government should increase its development of deep sea mining in the Arctic. 

### Advantage 2\-\-- Leadership

#### China accounts for half of the global supply chain -- that's directly U.S. defense chains and exposes vulnerability.

weapons, electronics and a range of consumer goods.]{.underline}

[[The move]{.mark}, which Beijing had long hinted was possible, further
ratchets up trade tensions between the world\'s two largest economies
and [leaves American manufacturers scrambling for]{.mark} fresh supplies

only one]{.mark} rare earths [mine]{.mark} [and most]{.mark} of its
[supply comes from China]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Beijing announced the controls late on Friday as part of a broader
package of tariffs and company restrictions in retaliation for Trump\'s
decision to hike tariffs against most Chinese products to 54%.

[[The export curbs]{.underline}]{.mark} include not only mined minerals
but permanent magnets and other finished [[products that will be

[[The move]{.underline}]{.mark}, which affects exports to all countries,

ability to **weaponize its dominance**]{.mark} [over]{.mark} the [mining
and processing of]{.mark} the [crit]{.mark}ical
[minerals]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Seven categories of medium and heavy rare earths, including samarium,
gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium-related
items, will be placed on an export control list as of April 4, according
to a Ministry of Commerce release.

co-chair of the Critical Minerals Institute trade group. \"[They
[picked]{.mark} the [things]{.mark} that are [**crucial for** the **U.S.

While the export controls stop short of an outright ban, [Beijing can
throttle shipments by restricting the number of export licenses it
issues.]{.underline}

[China\'s move will [create]{.mark} \"a **[scramble]{.mark} [for

[alternative supply]{.mark} -- namely in Japan and South
Korea]{.underline},\" said Ryan Castilloux, founder of consultancy
Adamas Intelligence.

\'WILLING TO ESCALATE\'

Two industry sources said Chinese export restrictions on some rare
earths are a concern for some U.S. aerospace manufacturers because they
are sole-sourced from China for use in avionics.

RTX (RTX.N), and Honeywell (HON.O), declined to comment. Boeing (BA.N),
and GE (GE.N), did not respond to requests for comment.

The U.S. government has stockpiles of some rare earths, but not enough
to supply its defense contractors in perpetuity.

[Beijing has already imposed outright bans on the export of three metals
to the U.S. and slapped export controls on many others.]{.underline}

[The moves to restrict heavy rare earths are especially important
because China has even tighter control over these elements, said David
Merriman at consultancy Project Blue.]{.underline}

\"There is currently only one HREE (heavy rare earth element) focused
operation outside of China, Myanmar and Laos,\" he said, adding that
China has close involvement in supply chains from Myanmar and Laos.

That mine, Serra Verde in Brazil, ships minerals to China for
processing, Merriman added.

[\"[China is **willing to escalate**]{.mark},\" said Nathan Picarsic,
co-founder of the geopolitical consulting firm Horizon Advisory. \"This

\] adiiiiG

On April 4, [[China]{.mark}'s Ministry of Commerce [**imposed export
restrictions** on seven]{.mark} rare earth elements ([REEs]{.mark}) and
magnets [used in]{.mark} the [defense, energy, and automotive
sectors]{.mark} in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff
increases on Chinese products.]{.underline} The new restrictions
[**apply to 7 of 17 REEs**---samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium,
lutetium, scandium, and yttrium]{.underline}---and requires companies to
secure special export licenses to export the minerals and magnets.

Q1: To what extent will the most recent export restrictions on rare
earths impact U.S. sourcing of these critical minerals for defense
technologies?

A1: There are various types of export restrictions: non-automatic
licensing, tariffs, quotas, and an outright ban. The new restrictions
are not a ban; rather, they require firms to apply for a license to
export rare earths. This development has three implications: first,
there will likely be a pause in exports as the Chinese government
establishes this licensing system. Second, [there is also [likely to be
disruptions]{.mark} in supply [to]{.mark} some [U.S. firms]{.mark} given
that the announcement also placed [16 U.S. entities]{.mark} on its
export control list, [limit]{.mark}ing them [from receiving]{.mark}
dual-use [goods]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[All]{.underline}]{.mark} but one
of the [[firms]{.mark} on the list **[are in the defense and aerospace
industries]{.mark}.**]{.underline} It is unclear how China will
implement the new licensing system. [And third, the licensing system may
be dynamic and [could incentivize countries]{.mark} across the world
**[to cooperate with China]{.mark}** to prevent disruptions in their
rare earths supply.]{.underline}

Q2: What is the significance of the focus on heavy rare earths given
U.S. supply chain vulnerabilities?

A2: The restrictions apply to seven medium and heavy rare earths:
samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and
yttrium. [The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates is **particularly
[vulnerable]{.mark}** for these supply chains.]{.underline} Until 2023,
[[China accounted for **99**]{.mark} **[percent of]{.mark} global heavy
[REEs processing]{.mark}**, with only minimal output from a refinery in
Vietnam]{.underline}. However, that facility has been shut down for the
past year due to a tax dispute, effectively giving China a monopoly over
supply. China did not impose restrictions on light rare earths, for
which a more diverse set of countries undertake processing.

Q3: Why are rare earths significant to U.S. national security?

A3: [[REEs are **crucial for**]{.mark} **a range of [defense
technologies]{.mark}**, [including]{.mark} [F-35]{.mark} fighter jets,
Virginia- and Columbia-class [submarines]{.mark}, Tomahawk
[missiles]{.mark}, [radar]{.mark} systems, Predator [unmanned aerial
vehicles]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} the Joint Direct Attack Munition series
of smart [bombs]{.mark}. For example, the [F-35]{.mark} fighter jet
[contain]{.mark}s **over [900 pounds of REEs]{.mark}**. An Arleigh
Burke-class DDG-51 destroyer requires approximately 5,200 pounds, while
a Virginia-class submarine uses around 9,200 pounds.]{.underline}

The United States is already on the back foot when it comes to
manufacturing these defense technologies. China is rapidly expanding its
munitions production and acquiring advanced weapons systems and
equipment at a pace five to six times faster than the United States.
While China is preparing with a wartime mindset, the United States
continues to operate under peacetime conditions. Even before the latest
restrictions, the U.S. defense industrial base struggled with limited
capacity and lacked the ability to scale up production to meet defense
technology demands. Further bans on critical minerals inputs will only
widen the gap, enabling China to strengthen its military capabilities
more quickly than the United States.

Q4: [Is the U.S. rare earths industry ready to fill the gap in the event
of a shortfall]{.underline}?

A4: [[No.]{.mark} There is no [heavy rare earths separation]{.mark}
[happening in the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates at
present]{.underline}. The development of these capabilities is currently
underway. In its 2024 National Defense Industrial Strategy, the
Department of Defense (DOD) set a goal to develop a complete
mine-to-magnet REE supply chain that can meet all U.S. defense needs by
2027. Since 2020, the DOD has committed over \$439 million toward
building domestic supply chains. In 2020, the Pentagon awarded MP
Materials \$9.6 million through the DPA Title III program for a light
rare earths separation facility at Mountain Pass, California. In 2022,
the Pentagon awarded an additional \$35 million for a heavy rare earths
processing facility. These facilities would be the first of their kind
in the United States, fully integrating the rare earths supply chain
from mining, separating, and leaching in Mountain Pass to refining and
magnet production in Fort Worth, Texas. [But even when these facilities
are fully operational, MP Materials will only be producing 1,000 tons of
neodymium-boron-iron (NdFeB) magnets by the end of 2025---**less than 1
percent** of the 138,000 tons of NdFeB magnets China produced in
2018]{.underline}. In 2024, MP Materials announced record production
of 1,300 tons of neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide. In the same year,
China produced an estimated 300,000 tons of NdFeB magnets.

The DOD has thrown its support behind Lynas Rare Earth's U.S.
subsidiary, Lynas USA, as well. The company was awarded a \$30.4
million DPA Title III grant in 2021 for a U.S. separation facility for
light REEs and another \$120 million in 2022 for a heavy REE processing
facility. These DPA investments are an important step in building
completely independent supply chains for REE magnets.  

Even with recent investments, [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is a
long way off from meeting the DOD's goal for]{.mark} a mine-to-magnet
REE supply chain [independent of China]{.mark}, and it is even further
from rivaling foreign adversaries in this strategic
industry]{.underline}. U.S. capabilities are largely early-stage. For
example, in January 2025, USA Rare Earths produced its first sample of
dysprosium oxide purified to 99.1 percent. Produced using ore from the
Round Top deposit in Texas and processed at a research facility in Wheat
Ridge Colorado, the company has called the development a breakthrough
for the domestic rare earths industry. However, significant work remains
to turn production of samples in a laboratory into full scale commercial
production capable of reducing reliance on China. Developing mining and
processing capabilities requires a long-term effort, meaning the United
States will be on the back foot for the foreseeable future.

Q5: Could the United States have seen this coming?

A5: Yes. A number of policies have foreshadowed that REE export
restrictions were on the horizon. China first weaponized rare earths in
2010 when it banned exports to Japan over a fishing trawler dispute.
[Between 2023 and 2025, China began imposing export restrictions of
strategic materials to the United States, including gallium, germanium,
antimony, graphite, and tungsten.]{.underline}

In 2023, the Select Committee on the Strategic Competition between the
United States and the Chinese Communist Party published a report
titled Reset, Prevent, Build: A Strategy to Win America\'s Economic
Competition with the Chinese Communist Party. It recommended that
"Congress should incentivize the production of rare earth element
magnets, which are the principal end-use for rare earth elements and
used in electric vehicles, wind turbines, wireless technology, and
countless other products." Specifically, it advocated for Congress to
establish tax incentives to promote U.S. manufacturing.

In December 2023, China imposed a ban of REE extraction and separation
technologies. It had a notable impact on developing REE supply chain
capabilities outside of China due to two main factors. First, China
possesses specialized technical expertise in this field that other
countries do not. For instance, it has an absolute advantage in solvent
extraction processing techniques for rare earths, an area where Western
companies have faced challenges both in implementing advanced
technological operations and in addressing environmental concerns.
Second, while multiple facilities for separation, processing, and
manufacturing are currently being built, completing construction and
bringing them fully online will take several years.

#### China's lead damages ecosystems, increases dependency, and elevates their military infrastructure.

[**[China already dominates the land-based global supply chains of
REEs]{.mark}**, as well as most extraction and processing
infrastructure, and is [steadily expanding its presence in]{.mark}
deep-sea mining ([DSM]{.mark})--- presenting energy, military, and
climate security concerns.]{.underline}

Chinese companies hold 5 of 31 International Seabed Authority contracts
that sanction the exploration and development of the ocean floor lying
outside of its national boundary. In 2017, Chinese scientists found
polymetallic nodules on the Puyuan seamount just south of Taiwan, and in
2020, China ramped up scientific explorations from two artificial
islands, the Fiery Cross and Subi Reefs in the South China Sea (SCS).
[To [falsely legitimize its research and development]{.mark} in the SCS,
**[China has intentionally misinterpreted]{.mark} traditional
[U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations [C]{.mark}onvention on the [L]{.mark}aw
[o]{.mark}f the [S]{.mark}ea [provisions.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

The steadily growing interest in DSM is partly fueled by difficulties in
extraction from foreign sources. [In 2021, [70% of cobalt was sourced
in]{.mark} the Democratic Republic of Congo ([DRC]{.mark}), [with
Chinese companies owning 15 of the country's 19 cobalt mines]{.mark}.
[Nearly all]{.mark} the cobalt from these mines is [shipped back to
China and refined]{.mark} before being sold, [**taking jobs and profit
away from the DRC while giving China near total control** of]{.mark} the
[cobalt supply chain]{.mark}.]{.underline} In fact, a Congolese court
recently removed operation of the Tenke Fungurume mine from a Chinese
company for cheating on royalty payments. Public backlash and a history
of political instability make the DRC a difficult country to invest in,
giving China reason to turn toward DSM research and development to
maintain its dominance of REEs.

[The [C]{.mark}hinese [C]{.mark}ommunist [P]{.mark}arty's policies
regarding its mineral resources are not just economically motivated but
[also politically motivated]{.mark}.]{.underline} In 2016, [[President
Xi]{.mark} Jinping [spoke]{.mark} directly [about]{.mark} the de[ep sea,
signaling intent to map and explore the ocean
floor]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} At the national level, mineral
exploration is about fulfilling the vision of a strong China at the
forefront of technological advancement. China has been investing heavily
in DSM technology and has developed the capability to extract minerals
from the seabed using remotely operated vehicles, while building up its
fleet of DSM vessels, which are equipped with advanced technology such
as sonar scanning systems.

[This vision is born out in the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025), which
outlines technological advancement and a marine economy, along with the
minerals needed for their creation, as critical components of China's
future success.]{.underline} The previous, 13th Five-Year Plan also made
specific mention of growing the DSM industry, including both its
commercialization and the innovation of the deep-sea equipment necessary
for mining. In response to these plans, [[China]{.mark} has
[developed]{.mark} an [international deep sea bed mining law and]{.mark}
a set of [environmental regulations on pollution and ecosystem damage.
However,]{.mark} the environmental legislation raises concerns over its
preventative **[measures]{.mark}**, which **[only regulate actions
after]{.mark}** the potentially **[irreparable mining process]{.mark}**
has been **[carried out]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Little is known about
how mining will impact the ocean and its connected ecosystems, but what
is clear is that more research is needed to fully understand the impact
on ocean ecosystems.

[Investment in DSM accomplishes **[two objectives for China. First, the
U.S. and the rest of the world]{.mark}** stand to [become]{.mark}
increasingly [**dependent on Chinese critical mineral supply**,
presenting]{.mark} a possible [risk to]{.mark} future [energy security,
tech]{.mark}nology, [and oceans]{.mark}. If there is restricted access
to REEs, [U.S. manufacturing of solar panels, microchips, and]{.mark}
precision guided [missiles will be limited]{.mark}, which will
[inhibit]{.mark} its [ability strategically compete with
China.]{.mark}]{.underline}

**[[Second]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the [[use of cobalt and]{.mark} other
[REEs]{.mark} is also **[critical for defense
manufacturing]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed, DSM may have [**[direct
defense implications]{.mark}**, as it is likely that information was
shared between the military, commercial, and scientific
communities]{.underline}. China has coupled military objectives with its
scientific and development projects in its push for influence in the
Arctic, and mapping the ocean floor produces bathymetric maps that
[[offer]{.mark} an [advantage in submarine warfare and in the planting
of sea floor mines.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### China holds a [monopoly]{.underline} on REE production, creating volatility in global supply chains.

Additionally, [[advancements in]{.mark} recycling technologies and the
development of a circular economy for critical minerals are crucial
trends shaping the future of clean energy systems]{.underline} (Koval et
al., 2023; Månberger, 2023). [Efficient [recycling processes]{.mark} for
end-of-life batteries, wind turbine magnets, and solar panels are being
developed to recover valuable materials such as cobalt, nickel and
REEs]{.underline} (Balaram, 2024). [These efforts aim to [reduce]{.mark}
the [environmental footprint of mining and processing]{.mark} while
creating a more **sustainable supply chain** for critical minerals. The
EU, for instance, has launched initiatives such as the European Battery
Alliance, which focuses on securing a domestic and sustainable supply of
battery materials through recycling and innovation (European Commission,
2020). Similar strategies are being implemented globally, reflecting a
growing recognition of the need to decouple economic growth from primary
resource extraction.]{.underline}

Emerging technologies are also influencing the landscape of critical
mineral supply chains. [For example, advances in materials science are
paving the way for the use of substitutes that can reduce dependence on
specific critical minerals.]{.underline} In the realm of electronics and
renewable energy technologies, research is focused on developing
materials that can replace REEs in magnets used for wind turbines and EV
motors (Depraiter and Goutte, 2023). [[Alternatives]{.mark} are being
explored to [reduce reliance on REEs]{.mark}, which are [predominantly
sourced from China]{.mark} (Widmer et al., 2015; Pavel et al., 2017;
Omodara et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2022). These [substitutions]{.mark}
could [lead to]{.mark} a more [diversified]{.mark} and **resilient
[supply chain]{.mark}**, mitigating the geopolitical risks associated
with the concentration of REE production.]{.underline}

Moreover, there is an [increasing emphasis on enhancing the extraction
and processing technologies for critical minerals to **improve**
efficiency and **environmental performance**. Innovations such as
biomining, where microorganisms are used to extract metals from ores,
are at the forefront of this evolution (Brierley, 2008; Rawlings, 2013;
Abashina and Vainshtein, 2023; Nayak, 2023). These methods promise to
make the production of critical minerals more sustainable and less
reliant on traditional, more environmentally damaging mining
practices.]{.underline}

The global production and supply chains of these critical elements are
intricate, often concentrated in a handful of nations.
[[China\'s]{.mark} command over [REE production]{.mark},
[account]{.mark}ing [for over **80% of**]{.mark} **the [global
supply]{.mark},** is a prime example (Wübbeke, 2013; Castillo and Purdy,
2022). The [DRC]{.mark} is a [major supplier of cobalt]{.mark},
[contributing]{.mark} nearly [70% of]{.mark} the [worldwide
demand]{.mark} (Sovacool, 2019; Deberdt and Le Billon, 2023). Such
[concentration engenders]{.mark} supply [vulnerabilities]{.mark}, where
geopolitical competition, social unrest, environmental policies, or
economic shifts could instigate global supply chain disruptions (Vivoda
et al., 2024a). The [geopolitical landscape]{.mark} heavily
[influences]{.mark} the [supply and demand dynamics]{.mark} of these
minerals (Kalantzakos, 2020; Nuttall, 2021; Vivoda, 2023; Vivoda et al.,
2024b). Issues such as [**resource nationalism**, trade
conflicts]{.mark}, and the [volatility of resource-rich states]{.mark}
can [threaten]{.mark} the [reliability]{.mark} and security [of
supplies]{.mark} (Wilson, 2017; Shiquan et al., 2023). For instance,
**[Sino-American frictions]{.mark}** have [escalated worries]{.mark}
over REEs availability, [given China\'s past in **leveraging market
dominance** during international disputes]{.mark} (Kalantzakos, 2017;
Chapman, 2018; Fan et al., 2022). Similarly, the [dependency on]{.mark}
the [DRC]{.mark} for cobalt [raises concerns about]{.mark} supply chain
ethics and [transparency]{.mark} (Calvão et al., 2021; Deberdt and Le
Billon, 2022).]{.underline}

To strengthen supply chain resilience, strategies are being deployed to
boost domestic production, broaden supply bases, invest in recycling and
alternative materials, and foster international cooperation for
developing new mining sites and processing capacities (Vivoda, 2023;
Vivoda and Matthews, 2023). These endeavours are crucial for
establishing a secure and sustainable supply base for critical minerals.
Governments and industries worldwide are increasingly recognising the
importance of diversifying supply sources and enhancing the
sustainability of critical mineral supply chains to support the
transition to clean energy systems. [Moving forward, continued
investment in technological innovation, recycling, and international
collaboration will be vital to meet the rising demand for these
essential materials while mitigating the associated environmental and
geopolitical risks.]{.underline}

[Secure sourcing of [crit]{.mark}ical [minerals is critical to]{.mark}
the [defense industrial base]{.mark}, which uses them [to
produce]{.mark} virtually **[every Defense Department system]{.mark}**,
from unmanned [aerial systems]{.mark} and [fighter jets]{.mark} to
**[submarines]{.mark}**, said Adam Burstein.]{.underline}

\<image omitted\>

[Burstein, technical director for strategic and critical materials in
the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Industrial Base
Policy]{.underline}, spoke today at the Naval War College in Newport,
Rhode Island.

[\"Recent [disruptions \[due to\] adversarial actions]{.mark} have
[underscored]{.mark} what we have long recognized, that [it is **more
urgent than ever** to build capability]{.mark} and resilience [in supply
chains for crit]{.mark}ical [minerals]{.mark},\" he said.]{.underline}

To do so, DOD must address challenges. Besides adversarial disruptions
of critical minerals, there are other problems related to critical
minerals like insufficient labor and training in the U.S. to meet
defense production demand, and inadequate U.S. and allied sourcing for
key materials and production, Burstein said.

[An example of disruption vulnerabilities, he said, has been [China\'s
attempts to **impose export bans** on]{.mark} [key materials]{.mark}
such as gallium, germanium and antimony.]{.underline}

[\"\[This has\] [demonstrated]{.mark} China\'s [willingness to
cause]{.mark} such a [disruption to critical U.S. supply chains]{.mark}
and [highlights]{.mark} the [urgency of securing]{.mark} our [supply
chains]{.mark} against such tactics,\" he said.]{.underline}

Industrial-based policies focus on increased domestic mining and
processing and align with broader DOD objectives to secure critical
supply chains, he said.

For example, since 2020 DOD has awarded more than \$439 million to
establish domestic rare earth element supply chains, he said.

[There are [17 elements]{.mark} on the periodic table [referred to as
rare earth]{.mark}. [DOD needs nearly **all of them**]{.mark} in some

#### Chinese tech supremacy causes nuclear war.

**Kroenig '18** \[Matthew; 11/12/18; Deputy Director for Strategy @
Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security, Associate Professor of
Government and Foreign Service @ Georgetown University; "Will disruptive
technology cause nuclear war?";
https://thebulletin.org/2018/11/will-disruptive-technology-cause-nuclear-war/\]

Recently, analysts have argued that emerging technologies with military
applications may undermine nuclear stability (see here, here, and here),
but the logic of these arguments is debatable and overlooks a more
straightforward reason why [[new tech]{.mark}nology [might cause
**nuclear conflict**: by upending the]{.mark} existing [balance of
power]{.mark} among nuclear-armed states. This latter concern is more
probable and dangerous and demands an immediate policy
response.]{.underline}

For more than 70 years, the world has avoided major power conflict, and
many attribute this era of peace to nuclear weapons. In situations of
mutually assured destruction (MAD), neither side has an incentive to
start a conflict because doing so will only result in its own
annihilation. The key to this model of deterrence is the maintenance of
secure second-strike capabilities---the ability to absorb an enemy
nuclear attack and respond with a devastating counterattack.

Recently analysts have begun to worry, however, that new strategic
military technologies may make it possible for a state to conduct a
successful first strike on an enemy. For example, Chinese colleagues
have complained to me in Track II dialogues that the United States may
decide to launch a sophisticated cyberattack against Chinese nuclear
command and control, essentially turning off China's nuclear forces.
Then, Washington will follow up with a massive strike with conventional
cruise and hypersonic missiles to destroy China's nuclear weapons.
Finally, if any Chinese forces happen to survive, the United States can
simply mop up China's ragged retaliatory strike with advanced missile
defenses. China will be disarmed and US nuclear weapons will still be
sitting on the shelf, untouched.

If the United States, or any other state acquires such a first-strike
capability, then the logic of MAD would be undermined. Washington may be
tempted to launch a nuclear first strike. Or China may choose instead to
use its nuclear weapons early in a conflict before they can be wiped
out---the so-called "use 'em or lose 'em" problem.

According to this logic, therefore, the appropriate policy response
would be to ban outright or control any new weapon systems that might
threaten second-strike capabilities.

This way of thinking about new technology and stability, however, is
open to question. Would any US president truly decide to launch a
massive, bolt-out-of-the-blue nuclear attack because he or she thought
s/he could get away with it? And why does it make sense for the country
in the inferior position, in this case China, to intentionally start a
nuclear war that it will almost certainly lose? More important, this
conceptualization of how new technology affects stability is too narrow,
focused exclusively on how new military technologies might be used
against nuclear forces directly.

Rather, [we should think more broadly about how new technology might
affect global politics, and, for this, it is helpful to turn to
scholarly international relations theory]{.underline}. [The **dominant
theory** of the causes of war in the academy is the "**bargaining
model** of war." This theory identifies rapid shifts in the balance of
power as a primary cause of conflict.]{.underline}

International politics often presents states with conflicts that they
can settle through peaceful bargaining, but when bargaining breaks down,
war results. [Shifts in the **balance of power** are problematic because
they **undermine effective bargaining.**]{.underline} After all, [why
agree to a deal today if your bargaining position will be stronger
tomorrow?]{.underline} [And, a clear understanding of the military
balance of power can contribute to peace. (Why start a war you are
likely to lose?) But shifts in the balance of power muddy understandings
of which states have the advantage.]{.underline}

You may see where this is going. [New technologies threaten to create
potentially **destabilizing shifts** in the balance of
power.]{.underline}

For decades, stability in Europe and Asia has been supported by US
military power. In recent years, however, the balance of power in Asia
has begun to shift, as **[China has increased its military
capabilities]{.underline}**. Already, [Beijing has become more assertive
in the]{.underline} region, claiming contested territory in the South
China Sea. And the results of Russia's military modernization have been
on full display in its ongoing intervention in Ukraine.

Moreover, China may have the lead over the United States in [[emerging
tech]{.mark}nologies that [could be **decisive** for]{.mark} the
[future]{.mark} of military acquisitions and
[warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[including]{.underline}]{.mark} 3D
printing, hypersonic missiles, **[[quantum]{.underline}]{.mark}**
computing, **[[5G]{.underline}]{.mark}** wireless connectivity,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} artificial intelligence
(**[[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}**). And Russian President Vladimir Putin is
building new unmanned vehicles while ominously declaring, "Whoever leads
in AI will rule the world."

If China or Russia are able to incorporate new technologies into their
militaries before the United States, then this could lead to the kind of
rapid shift in the balance of power that often causes war.

[[If Beijing believes emerging tech]{.mark}nologies [provide it]{.mark}
with [a]{.mark} newfound, local [military advantage]{.mark} over the
United States, for example, [it may be]{.mark} more [willing]{.mark}
than previously **[to initiate conflict]{.mark} over
Taiwan**]{.underline}. And if Putin thinks new tech has strengthened his
hand, he may be more tempted to launch a Ukraine-style invasion of a
NATO member.

[Either scenario could bring these nuclear powers into direct conflict
with the United States, and once nuclear armed states are at war, [there
is]{.mark} an [**inherent risk** of **nuclear conflict** through]{.mark}
limited nuclear war strategies, nuclear **brinkmanship**, or simple
[**accident** or **inadvertent escalation**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

This framing of the problem leads to a different set of policy
implications. The concern is not simply technologies that threaten to
undermine nuclear second-strike capabilities directly, but, rather, any
technologies that can result in a meaningful shift in the broader
balance of power. And **[the solution]{.underline}** is not to preserve
second-strike capabilities, but to [**preserve prevailing power
balances** more broadly.]{.underline}

When it comes to new technology, this means that [[the]{.mark}
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[should seek to maintain]{.underline} [an]{.underline} **[innovation
edge]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Washington should also work with other
states, including its nuclear-armed rivals, to develop a new set of arms
control and nonproliferation agreements and export controls to deny
these newer and potentially destabilizing technologies to potentially
hostile states.

[These are no easy tasks, but the consequences of Washington [losing the
**race for tech**]{.mark}**nological [superiority]{.mark}** to its
autocratic challengers just might [mean **nuclear
Armageddon**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Gov]{.mark}ernment[s]{.mark} [across]{.mark} the [world]{.mark} have
[sought to acquire Chinese digital tech]{.mark}nology. Huawei, given its
scale, has been central to this, often incorporating the technologies
developed by China's smaller, more focused firms]{.underline}. The
anecdotal evidence suggests four broad ways that these exports can be
adapted by recipient governments to facilitate digital repression.

[The first is facial recognition]{.underline}. Huawei's Safe City
programs generally feature video surveillance cameras, which feed data
to police command centers and help detect dissidents. Huawei began
marketing its Safe City technology abroad in 2010 (Chin and Lin
Reference Chin and Lin2022, 134). In 2017, Huawei identified 40
countries where its Smart City surveillance technology had been
introduced. By 2018, its reach had expanded to at least 90 countries and
230 cities (Cave et al. Reference Cave, Hoffman, Joske, Ryan and
Thomas2019). [By 2019, Huawei had installed Safe City systems in 700
cities across more than 100 countries (Chin and Lin Reference Chin and
Lin2022, 135). [Huawei pitches]{.mark} its [digital surveillance
tech]{.mark}nologies to **national security agencies**, with subsidized
financing provided by China's Exim Bank (Feldstein Reference
Feldstein2019).]{.underline} ZTE provides similar packages, but its
scope is much smaller. It began marketing its Safe City solutions
several years after Huawei and, by 2019, had built similar systems in
160 cities across 45 countries (Chin and Lin Reference Chin and Lin2022,
135). [Governments occasionally advertise these surveillance
capabilities to citizens, even emphasizing their Chinese
origins]{.underline}. In Cameroon, as the Anglophone Crisis raged in
February 2017, the government announced a contract with Huawei on the
front page of its flagship propaganda newspaper, the Cameroon Tribune,
that provided for "1,500 cameras in regional capitals and certain
strategic points in the country," "2,000 portable listening devices
equipped with cameras," and "the construction of nine command centers"
(Carter and Carter Reference Carter and Carter2023).

[Second, the [telecomm]{.mark}unications [networks]{.mark} installed by
Huawei generally feature surveillance middleboxes with Deep Packet
Inspection capabilities. These middleboxes [power China's Great
Firewall]{.mark}, the [**most extensive censorship** op]{.mark}eration
[in]{.mark} human [history]{.mark}]{.underline} (King, Pan and Roberts
Reference King, Pan and Roberts2013). [[They]{.mark} [monitor]{.mark}
users' [internet activity]{.mark}, can [censor]{.mark} online [content,
and]{.mark} can [block access to]{.mark} virtual [private
networks]{.mark}]{.underline} (Weber and Ververis Reference Weber and
Ververis2021). Huawei's middleboxes have been documented in 72
countries. In at least 18 of those, the middleboxes have been used for
internet censorship (Earp Reference Earp2021; Weber and Ververis
Reference Weber and Ververis2021). Middleboxes with Deep Packet
Inspection [capabilities have been [linked to]{.mark} internet and
social media **[shutdowns]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Woodhams and O'Donnell
Reference Woodhams and O'Donnell2021), [an increasingly
[ubiquitous]{.mark} feature of life [in autocracies]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Feldstein Reference Feldstein2021), even if such shutdowns undermine a
government's ability to collect high-quality intelligence (Gohdes
Reference Gohdes2015, Reference Gohdes2020, Reference Gohdes2024).

[Third, [China's tech]{.mark}nology [transfers]{.mark} have been [used
to create]{.mark} the sort of [integrated surveillance system
that]{.mark} the CCP's **[Golden Shield Project]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[pioneered]{.underline}]{.mark}. This has been [[especially]{.mark}
well documented [in Venezuela]{.mark}]{.underline}, where ZTE helped the
government create a national identification card -- dubbed the

developed the ID card's mobile payment application. The [Maduro

state resources]{.mark} to loyalists [and **monitor

announced in 2016. Said one Venezuelan technical advisor, who was

in China changed everything. [They]{.mark} we[re looking to have]{.mark}
**[citizen control]{.mark}**]{.underline}" (Berwick Reference
Berwick2018). As of 2015, ZTE was helping the government build a series
of "emergency response centers" in urban areas and centralize its video
surveillance capabilities (U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations
2020, 30-31). The broader objective, many citizens believe, is a "social
credit system" modeled after the CCP's (Polyakova and Meserole Reference
Polyakova and Meserole2019).

#### Global authoritarianism causes extinction---only strong influence by democratic states solve

[[A world dominated by totalitarian states would be]{.underline}]{.mark}
more incompetent, [[more war-prone]{.mark}, less
cooperative]{.underline}, and more inhibitive of progress [[than]{.mark}
one dominated by [democratic states]{.mark}]{.underline}. Our current
world is not particularly competent, peaceful, cooperative, or
progressive---a totalitarian-dominated world would be worse. [[It would
increase the risk of]{.mark} another [collapse and
extinction]{.mark}]{.underline} and could shape the future toward less
desirable trajectories (Beckstead, 2013).

[Totalitarian states are incompetent. They are bad at forecasting and
dealing with disasters]{.underline} (Caplan, 2008).16 This can be seen
most clearly in the great famines of Communist China and the USSR, in
which millions died (Applebaum, 2017; Becker, 1996; Dikötter, 2010;
Snyder, 2010). In comparison, functioning multiparty democracies rarely,
if ever, experience famines (Sen, 2010). "Established autocracies" (or
"personal"/"sultanist") are particularly bad, as there are few checks or
restraints on arbitrary rule and the whims and ideology of the single
individual, even from other elites (Svolik, 2012). From the inside, the
"inner circle" around Mao, Stalin, and Hitler seems incredibly chaotic,
with elites strongly incentivized to conceal information and encouraged
by the autocrat to squabble and feud---so they are divided (Conquest,
1992; Kershaw, 2008; Zhang & Halliday, 2006). If totalitarian states are
worse at addressing social, environmental, and technological problems,
then a world dominated by them would likely be worse at responding to
risks of collapse and extinction.

A world dominated by totalitarian states is more likely to have major
wars. States with near-universal adult suffrage rarely (if ever) go to
war with one another (Barnhart et al., 2020), so [[a world dominated by
democracies has fewer wars]{.underline}.
[Miscalc]{.underline}]{.mark}[ulation [might be]{.mark}]{.underline}
[a]{.mark} particular [[problem for totalitarian states due to
personalization and disincentives for accurate
info]{.mark}rmation,]{.underline} leading to well-known strategic
disasters such as Hitler and Stalin's blunders in World War II (Bialer,
1970; Noakes & Pridham, 2001), or at a smaller level, Saddam Hussein's
rejection of diplomacy (Atkinson, 1993). [[War
makes]{.underline}]{.mark} collapse and [[extinction]{.mark} more
[likely, by]{.mark} raising the chance of [w]{.mark}eapons of
[m]{.mark}ass [d]{.mark}estruction [being used]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Linked to this, [[totalitarian states are less cooperative]{.mark} than
democratic states]{.underline}. While cooperation is possible (Ginsburg,
2020), [their [internal norms are characterized by
paranoia]{.mark}]{.underline} and treachery, and their lack of
transparency limits their ability to credibly commit to agreements.
[[This is bad for]{.mark} all [risks that require cooperation such
as]{.mark} [pandemics or climate change]{.mark}]{.underline} (Tomasik,
2015).

Finally, [continued social and [scientific progress is likely to reduce
risks of]{.mark}]{.underline} collapse and
[[extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}. Social progress could reduce global
inequality and other risk factors. [[Scientific progress could help
address natural risks and climate change]{.underline}]{.mark} (Sandberg,
2018), differentially increase defensive rather than offensive power
(Garfinkel & Dafoe, 2019), [[and solve safety challenges in AI or
biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology (Russell, 2019).
[[However,]{.underline}]{.mark} as we will now discuss [[totalitarian
states would likely inhibit social progress]{.underline}]{.mark}.

A central question from a longtermist perspective is: Which values
should shape the future? I would argue that we should prefer it to be
shaped by liberal democratic values. This is not to say that the current
democracy-dominated world is perfect---far from it. The fate of billions
of factory-farmed animals or hundreds of millions of people in extreme
poverty makes that abundantly clear. However, democracies have two
advantages. First, [democracies have space for cosmopolitan values such
as human rights, plurality, freedom, and equality. These are better than
those that characterize life under totalitarianism: Fear, terror,
subjection, and secrecy]{.underline}. Second, they have within
themselves the mechanism to allow progress. In the last 100 (or even 50)
years, the lives of women, LGBT people, religious minorities, and
non-white people have dramatically improved. Our "moral circle" has
expanded, and could continue to expand (Singer, 1981). The arc of the
moral universe is long, but given the right conditions, it might just
bend toward justice (King, 1968). A global society dominated by these
values, and with the possibility of improving more, has a better
longterm potential. [A totalitarian-dominated world,]{.underline} on the
other hand, [would reduce the space for resistance and
progress---distorting the human trajectory.]{.underline}

[We should be particularly concerned about "bottlenecks" at which values
are particularly important---where there is a risk of
"locking-in]{.underline}" [some]{.underline} particular set of (possibly
far from optimal) [values]{.underline}. While they are currently faroff,
[future technologies such as artificial general intelligence, space
settlement, life extension (of autocrats), or much better surveillance
could enable lock-in]{.underline} (Caplan, 2008).17

Conditional on them avoiding new catastrophes, world orders dominated by
totalitarians could be quite long-lasting (Caplan, 2008). Democracies
can undermine authoritarian and totalitarian regimes through the
following ways: Control, including conquest; contagion through
proximity; and consent, promoting receptivity toward democratization
(Whitehead, 2001). Democracies can actively undermine these regimes
through war, sanctions, hosting rebellious exiles, or sponsoring
internal movements. Passively, through contagion, they offer a
demonstration that a better, more prosperous life is possible. For
example, in the final years of the USSR, ordinary Soviet citizens were
able to see that the West had a higher standard of living---more
innovation, more choice, and more consumer goods. The elites were able
to read books from the outside, and travel---Gorbachev's contacts and
friendships with European politicians may have made him more favorable
to social democracy (Brown, 1996). Democracies can undermine the will
and capacity of the coercive apparatus (Bellin, 2004). However, in a
world not dominated by democracies, all these pressures would be far
less.

A world in which, say, totalitarian regimes emerged as dominant after
World War II (for example if the USA was defeated) could be
self-reinforcing and long-lasting, like the self-reinforcing
relationship of Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia (Orwell, 1949). Orwell's
fictional world is characterized by constant low-grade warfare to
justify emergency powers and secure elites, and with shifting alliances
of convenience as states bandwagon and balance, thereby preventing any
resolution. A totalitarian-dominated world order could be rather robust,
perhaps for decades or even centuries.

[[A]{.mark} long-lasting [totalitarian]{.mark}-dominated [world
would]{.mark} extend the period of time humanity would spend with a
heightened risk of collapse or extinction, as well as increased
potential for distortion of the human trajectory and the possibility
that a "[lock-in"]{.mark} event may occur]{.underline}. This example
illustrates the possibility of a "negative recovery," [[resulting in a
trajectory]{.underline} [with less or no scientific and social
progress]{.underline}]{.mark} [and a less favorable geopolitical
situation, [which would threaten the destruction of humanity]{.mark}'s
longterm potential]{.underline}.

[[The Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, long known for its substantial proven
reserves of oil and natural gas, [[is]{.mark} also [home to]{.mark}
[large quantities of]{.mark} critical [minerals]{.mark} necessary
[to]{.mark} help [alleviate growing demand]{.mark} over the coming
decades]{.underline}. [[Access to]{.underline}]{.mark} sovereign
supplies of [these minerals, including [rare earths, is driving]{.mark}
new geopolitical competition and [commercial
opportunity]{.mark}.]{.underline} Consequently, the Arctic[,
[including]{.underline}]{.mark} its transnational areas[, is [an
increasingly attractive option for d]{.mark}eep [s]{.mark}ea
[m]{.mark}ining exploration and exploitation.]{.underline} [Investment
is]{.underline} likely to continue [rising due primarily to a warming
climate, newfound accessibility, and regional interest]{.underline}. The
appeal of [[offshore mining]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Arctic lies not
[only in its reserves of critical resources, but also [in the
distinctive geophysical characteristics]{.mark} that [differentiate it
from other seabed and land-based alternatives.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Furthermore, the national regulatory [frameworks]{.underline} that
currently apply [to deep sea mining in the Arctic can be more conducive
to resource development than other offshore regions.]{.underline}Going
Low to go High: Shallowness and Higher Quality Fundamentally, [[the
Arctic Ocean's shallowness is]{.mark} a significant comparative
advantage]{.underline}. The Arctic Ocean is the shallowest of Earth\'s
five oceans with [[a]{.mark}n average [depth of 1,204
meters]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is substantially [[less than the
4,000-meter average depth of the Pacific]{.mark} Ocean]{.underline},
currently the global hub of deep sea mining activity and home to the
Clarion-Clipperton Zone, where much of the activity is concentrated.
Historically, the issue of cost-effectiveness at varying ocean depths
was a significant contributing factor to halting the industry in the
1980s. Mineral prices had been inflated prior to 1974, and subsequently
began a steep decline as more efficient resource utilization in
land-mining became widespread, and a wider global slowdown in
productivity exacerbated this price trend. [[The depth]{.mark} of the
mining site [has a]{.mark} positive [correlation with]{.mark} the
operational [complexity,]{.mark} logistical [cost, and]{.mark}
associated [risks]{.mark}, [making the]{.mark} [Arctic\'s]{.mark}
relatively [shallow depth an undeniable advantage]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Today, the growing global decline in ore quality from critical
land-based mines is leading to increased extraction and processing
costs, with a significant impact on future profitability. The unique
geography of the Arctic Ocean provides [[another critical
benefit]{.underline}]{.mark}, even compared to Arctic land-based mining:
the Arctic Ocean has a significant number of [[hydrothermal
vents]{.underline}]{.mark}. These are vents where [concentrations of
minerals such as [copper, gold, and zinc are usually found in
significant quantities]{.mark}]{.underline}. Today, the growing [global
decline in ore quality from critical land-based mines]{.underline} is
leading to increased extraction and processing costs, with a
[significant impact on future profitability]{.underline}. This trend
among land-based mines coincides with [the [potential for the Arctic\'s
d]{.mark}eep [s]{.mark}ea [m]{.mark}ining [to
harvest]{.mark}]{.underline} a variety of both ore types as well as
[[rare earth elements from a single site]{.mark}.]{.underline} Given the
consistently higher grades of seabed-mined ores, [[d]{.mark}eep
[s]{.mark}ea [m]{.mark}ining [could prove]{.mark} notably [more
cost-effective]{.mark}, especially when considering [it requires far
less]{.mark} by way of infrastructure and transport systems [than
terrestrial mining]{.mark}]{.underline}. Further, seabed deposits have
the potential to provide substantially more usable material: on average,
[[99% of a seabed deposit is potentially usable material, compared to
just 20% from land-based sources]{.underline}]{.mark}. [This]{.mark}
efficiency [underlines the [strategic importance of the Arctic for
future deep sea mining operations,]{.underline}]{.mark} and explains why
Arctic and non-Arctic nations alike are backing companies to compete for
these resources in the High North Stabilizing Political Risk Factors.

Executive Summary: New deep-sea technologies, growing influence in the
International Seabed Authority, and domestic legislation are part of the
People's Republic of China's (PRC) ambitions to become a strong maritime
power. The PRC is the world's largest net importer of critical minerals,
a potential vulnerability that could be alleviated through exploiting
the ocean floor. This would help reinforce its already dominant position
in the critical minerals supply chain and in the manufacture of the key
technologies of the energy transition. The International Seabed
Authority is currently negotiating a mining code. The PRC has been among
the most vocal advocates for opening international waters to mining and
in 2023 opposed the creation of an inspection body to enforce a future
code, while last year it unilaterally blocked a motion to pause mining
activities out of environmental concerns. Deep-sea activity conducted by
the PRC, including scientific research, is closely linked to the
country's military. Key institutions are subject to U.S. government
sanctions and export controls, and research vessels have been caught
undertaking exploration activities within the exclusive economic zones
of other nations or planting the PRC flag in contested areas. [[In
**December 2024**]{.mark}, the People's Republic of China ([PRC]{.mark})
[announced]{.mark} the commissioning of [Tansuo 3]{.mark} (探索三号), a
state of the art deep-sea [research vessel]{.mark} designed to
[facilitate surveys across]{.mark} most of the [world's oceans]{.mark},
**[including]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline} (People's Daily,
December 27, 2024). A month prior, the government also unveiled the
first domestically designed deep-sea drilling vessel, Mengxiang (梦想号)
(State Council, November 17, 2024). [These technological developments
are the [result of ambition]{.mark}s [to become]{.mark} a "**[strong sea
power]{.mark}** (海洋强国),"]{.underline} which entail a growing focus
on the ocean floor (State Council, April, 2013). Beijing seeks to
dominate the development and manufacture of the technologies of the
future, including those crucial to the energy transition. These
technologies often rely in part on minerals and metals that can be
extracted from the seabed. Access to the seabed is currently restricted
by physical and regulatory barriers. Technological advances (and
state-led investment) are making headway on the first, while Beijing's
influence within of the International Seabed Authority (ISA) and
willingness to ignore other states' maritime claims have led to progress
on the second. The degree to which PRC activity is conducted by the
People Liberation Army (PLA) and entities affiliated with it suggests
that Beijing's interests in the ocean floor are not limited to the
scientific or the commercial, but rather to its wider maritime strategy
and conception of its own comprehensive national power. Decades of Work
Underpins Deep-sea Dominance The deep sea, typically defined as water
located 200 meters or more below the surface, is one of the least
explored parts of the planet. However, recent developments in technology
have begun to make it more accessible. As the global energy transition
accelerates, the demand for critical minerals has surged. Cobalt,
nickel, and rare earth elements have become indispensable to achieving a
low-carbon future, as they are essential for renewable energy
technologies such as electric vehicles (EVs), wind turbines, and solar
panels. [The PRC has emerged as the key player in the deep sea domain
under President Xi Jinping. In 2013, shortly after assuming power,
[Xi]{.mark} unveiled [plans]{.mark} for [the PRC to become]{.mark} a
[strong sea power as **part of**]{.mark} **his "[China Dream]{.mark}**
(中国梦)" vision, [emphasizing]{.mark} the [need for
"exploration]{.mark}, exploitation, and protection of the sea
(开发，利用和保护海洋)" in the country's broader developmental strategy
(State Council, April, 2013).]{.underline} Two years later, a revision
to the national security law included the protection of the country's
activities and assets in the international seabed as a critical
component of national security (State Council, July, 2015). This was
followed in 2016 by legislation that created a legal framework for
regulating deep-sea exploration (NPC, March 2016). The PRC has also made
substantial investments in the research and development of deep-sea
technology. [[The]{.mark} 13th **[Five-Year Plan]{.mark}** on Scientific
and Technological Innovation ("十三五"国家科技创新计划), issued [in
2016, identified deep-sea tech]{.mark}nology [as]{.mark} one of 13
strategic and forward-looking [scientific prioriti]{.mark}es, and
outlined six major technological projects to be achieved by 2030 (State
Council, July 28, 2016).]{.underline} These investments have built on
decades of state-led efforts that have enabled the PRC to dominate the
critical minerals supply chain. [[As early as 1987]{.mark}, [Deng
Xiaoping signaled]{.mark} an [interest]{.mark} in the sector, [stating
that "**the Middle East has oil, China has rare earths**]{.mark}
(中东有石油，中国有稀土)" (CNR, August 16, 2007).]{.underline} As a
result, the PRC now accounts for approximately 60 percent of global
critical mineral extraction and an even larger share---85 percent---of
the refining process (China Brief, October 8, 2010; March 15, 2021).
These days, the PRC relies for the most part on raw minerals from
outside the country, to the extent that it is the world's largest net
importer. [Over the years, [it]{.mark} [has]{.mark} built up its
[dominant position]{.mark} through [extensive]{.mark} overseas
[investments]{.mark}, [advanced]{.mark} mineral [processing
capabilities]{.mark}, and its role in [manufacturing]{.mark} high-value
[components, such as batteries]{.mark} (The Brookings Institution, July,
2022).]{.underline} For instance, while the PRC holds only 2 percent of
global nickel reserves and 5 percent of nickel mining, PRC companies
control two-fifths of raw nickel mining and over four-fifths of the
refining (ISS, April 12, 2023). This dependency makes the PRC vulnerable
to external supply shocks. For example, in 2020, Indonesia---the largest
global producer of nickel---banned nickel ore exports to stimulate the
development of its domestic mineral processing industry, disrupting PRC
access (IEA, March 19, 2024). Although the PRC was able to substitute
with imports from the Philippines, that country is now also considering
an export ban or tax on nickel ore (SP Global, February 7, 2023;
Business Mirror, January 29). Deep-sea mining could therefore provide an
opportunity to reduce dependence on imports and increase its
self-reliance.

**[PRC Preferences Shape the ISA]{.underline}** Most deep sea mineral
reserves are in international waters beyond countries' exclusive
economic zones. where deep-sea mining is currently prohibited under
international law. Exploration can only be carried out under a contract
with the ISA, and is subject to its rules, regulations, and procedures.
(The ISA is a body established under the United Nations Convention on
the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) in 1994 that grants exploration rights for
the purpose of research and prospecting. [The [PRC is]{.mark} prominent
within the [ISA]{.mark} (USNI News, November 29, 2023). It is the
organization['s **largest financial contributor**]{.mark} and [holds
more active exploration contracts than any other nation]{.mark} (five
out of 30). These [grant]{.mark} the [PRC]{.mark} [access to]{.mark}
nearly 235,000 square kilometers of [mineral-rich regions]{.mark} in the
Western Pacific Ocean, the Southwest Indian Ridge, and the
Clarion-Clipperton Zone in the Eastern Pacific. [Viewing]{.mark} the
[ISA as]{.mark} an [avenue to **reshape**]{.mark} **the [international
maritime order]{.mark}**, which [it perceives as dominated by U.S.
heg]{.mark}emony, the [PRC]{.mark} has [positioned itself as]{.mark} a
**[champion of multilateralism]{.mark} and equality**.]{.underline}
During a UNCLOS event in 2022, a PRC delegate called for replacing the
"outdated maritime order (落后时代的旧海洋规则)" with a new one based on
these principles (MFA, September 2, 2022). In contrast, the United
States has not ratified UNCLOS and holds no ISA contracts, though it has
observer status at negotiations and the ISA has approved the extension
of mining contracts issued by the U.S. government before the ISA's
creation (CRS, November 26, 2024). Figure 1:Designated Areas for the PRC
to Conduct Deep Sea Exploration (Source: ISA, access: January 21, 2025)
Figure 2: Area of the Sea Floor Assigned for Exploration to Countries
With at Least two ISA Contracts (Source: ISA, access: January 21)
Further solidifying its dominance, the PRC partnered with the ISA in
2020 to establish the ISA-China Joint Training and Research Centre in
Qingdao (ISA, accessed: January 21). This initiative focuses on
capacity-building and the transfer of marine technology to developing
countries through training workshops, enhancing PRC leadership. [At the
regulatory level within the ISA, the PRC has been keen to ensure that
its ambitions are not restricted. It has been among the most vocal
**advocates for** opening international waters to
**mining**]{.underline}. In 2023, it opposed the creation of an
inspection body to enforce a future mining code negotiated by ISA
members, and at the organization's annual meeting unilaterally blocked a
motion that advocated for a precautionary pause on deep-sea mining
activities due to concerns over potential environmental consequences
(ISA, February, 2023; The Guardian, July 29, 2023). \[1\] Later this
year, two PRC state-owned enterprises, China Minmetals (中国五矿) and
Beijing Pioneer Hi-Tech Development Corporation (北京先驱高技术开发),
will test their deep-sea mining equipment in ISA-designated regions
(ISA, April 23, 2024; May 1, 2024). These tests are nominally for the
collection of environmental data collection but the company also hopes
that the results will inform future regulations (Beijing Pioneer Hi-Tech
Development Corporation, May 1, 2024). [The [ISA]{.mark} is [set to
finalize]{.mark} a [mining code]{.mark} this year (Mongabay, July 4,
2024). This may be delayed due to unresolved disputes, but the
[PRC]{.mark} will continue to [play a **leading role** in
negotiations]{.mark}]{.underline}. As such, the opening of international
waters for deep-sea mining appears increasingly likely. [Military Facet
of Scientific Research [Deep-sea activity]{.mark} conducted [by the
PRC]{.mark}, including scientific research, is [**closely linked** to
the country's military]{.mark}]{.underline}. A 2017 State Council
Opinion called for integrating civilian and military efforts in the
maritime domain, including deep-sea exploration, intentionally blurring
the lines between scientific research and military objectives (State
Council, November 23, 2017). As a result, the country's main players
have deep ties to the People's Liberation Army (PLA). This includes the
China State Shipbuilding Corporation (中国船舶集团) and Harbin
Engineering University (哈尔滨工程大学), which are the subject of
sanctions and export controls, respectively, from the U.S. government
(OFAC, accessed January 29; Federal Register, accessed January 29).
China State Shipbuilding Corporation oversees the production of nearly
all PRC naval vessels and has contributed to the development of
platforms that include the deep-sea drilling vessel Mengxiang. Harbin
Engineering University remains closely affiliated with the navy and
supports its deep-sea operations. \[2\] [Advances in deep sea technology
are enabling much greater understanding of this little-explored part of
the planet, but they also enhance the PLA's maritime military
capabilities]{.underline}. [For example, unmanned [underwater
vehicles]{.mark} such as the Haidou 1 (海斗一号) have demonstrated the
ability to patrol the seabed for over 10 hours at depths exceeding
10,000 meters, and to **[conduct]{.mark} various [mapping]{.mark}** [and
communications activities]{.mark}. Similarly, the Kaituo 2 (开拓二号),
another unmanned vehicle, can perform seabed mining at depths over 4,000
meters (SJTU, July 11, 2024). These technologies could [easily]{.mark}
be [repurposed to map]{.mark} the ocean floor in [adversaries'
jurisdictions]{.mark}, monitor harbor activities, or [**deploy**
anti-surface and **anti-submarine** weapons]{.mark}. The [bottom of the
ocean]{.mark} is [increasingly]{.mark} becoming a [contested
space]{.mark}, with a [number of ships]{.mark}---often [alleged to have
ties to the PRC]{.mark} or Russia---apparently [responsible for
**severing undersea cables** that facilitate]{.mark} [global
information]{.mark} and data [flows]{.mark} (China Brief Notes, January
16).]{.underline} Harbin Marine Equipment (哈尔滨船舶设备), a subsidiary
of Harbin Engineering University, has developed unmanned underwater
vehicles to conduct engineering surveys and maintenance (Perma, August
2, 2017). [[Such tech]{.mark}nologies [could]{.mark} also be repurposed
to [target]{.mark} or compromise [cable infra]{.mark}structure
[in]{.mark} the event of a [conflict]{.mark}. The [military dimension of
PRC]{.mark} deep-sea exploration [intersects with]{.mark} [international
regulatory]{.mark} and legal [regimes in disputed waters]{.mark} (The

nations such as the Philippines, Malaysia, Japan, Taiwan, Palau, and
even the United States (Washington Post, October 19, 2023). Submersibles
have also planted the PRC flag on the seabed in contested areas,
asserting Beijing's sovereignty in violation of international law.

Conclusion In the PRC's pursuit to become a strong maritime nation, it
engages in efforts to reshape approaches to the deep sea. Using
technologies mainly developed by entities linked to the country's
military, it seeks to expand deep-sea mining in order to acquire the
necessary minerals to support its economic objectives. The deployment of
vessels like Tansuo 3 and Mengxiang reflects these ambitions. Beijing
has also made substantial progress influencing global regulatory bodies
to better express its preferences. While some activities, including
scientific research and international workshops, contribute tangible
public goods, the dual-use character of its approach threatens many
other countries, particularly those in the South China Sea. The deep sea
is just one of several "new frontiers (新边界)" that the PRC sees itself
at the forefront of, along with the polar regions, space, and
cyberspace, as an article in the overseas edition of the People's Daily
from last summer makes clear (People's Daily, April 6, 2024). Many of
the approaches Beijing uses to advance its interests at the bottom of
the ocean are analogous to those used in other domains and are
underpinned by the same principles. As such, implications of the PRC's
strategy to become a strong sea power are also relevant in other domains
(China Brief, November 5, 2024). The authors would like to thank an
anonymous reviewer for their feedback on an earlier draft of this
article. Notes \[1\] The PRC later climbed down from this position and
agreed to include the issue on the following year's agenda, where it was
discussed but no action was taken. \[2\] Harbin Engineering University

#### China bad for environment and cut off military operations by restricting resources to the U.S.

[[**The U.S. is currently heading for a major national security train
wreck**.]{.underline}]{.mark} Bewildering environmental policies, energy
plans detached from reality, and an [[incomprehensible practice of
trusting China to provide critical components for]{.mark} both [civilian
and military tech]{.mark}nologies is an [unsustainable
trajectory]{.mark}.]{.underline} The administration has rejected fossil
fuels, [driving us commercially and across the defense industry toward
electric vehicles]{.underline}. The problem is, [[China has]{.mark} a
[near-monopoly on the mining and refinement of r]{.mark}are
[e]{.mark}arth [m]{.mark}ineral[s]{.mark} (such as lithium and cobalt)
that are used in EV batteries.]{.underline} China also monopolizes the
production of those same batteries. In short, America is being forced to
tie its future to EVs while having no capability to provide key elements
of the system. [Adding to the dilemma is that China is "allowed" to do
all the "yucky stuff" we won't do, or don't want to do. The rub here is
that **[China is not a client we can order about]{.mark}**. It isn't
even our friend. Today, [China]{.mark} is [taking advantage of current
geopolitics to]{.mark} further e[ntrench itself as the leading global
producer of r]{.mark}are [e]{.mark}arth
[m]{.mark}ineral[s]{.mark}.]{.underline} Critical minerals are already
in short supply and heavily controlled by foreign powers. China
dominates the global marketplace for rare earth metals through its
control of both the production and processing. [[China produces
three-quarters of all lithium-ion batteries]{.mark} in the world, with a
single Chinese manufacturer, CATL, controlling 30% of the global EV
battery market. China also [refines 80% of the world's cobalt and 60% of
the world's lithium]{.mark}, two critical minerals key for electric
vehicles. [Meanwhile, the **United States refines 0% of the world's
cobalt**]{.mark}.]{.underline} As the White House report on "Building
Resilient Supply Chains, Revitalizing American Manufacturing and
Fostering Broad-Based Growth" (June 2021) acknowledged, by "operating
well outside globally accepted practices," China has been able to
"develop battery-critical materials infrastructure well ahead of market
drivers." [[China doesn't care a wit for the
environment]{.mark}.]{.underline} The mess it has at home and its drive
for control of these elements prove it. The Biden administration knows
of this problem, acknowledging critical minerals as an important issue
to address in one of President Joe Biden's earliest executive orders.
That order specifically identified the need for the United States to
have "resilient, diverse, and secure supply chains to ensure our
economic prosperity and national security." Unfortunately, the opposite
has occurred. That same executive order led to a 100-day review report
that specifically identified how important a reliable supply chain is
for U.S. national security. [The [importance of lithium-ion batteries to
military equipment and]{.mark} the [need for rare earth metals]{.mark}
used [in airplanes and defense equipment was
highlighted]{.mark}]{.underline}. The report also acknowledged that
changes in future military advancements will require "high-density
energy storage to support agile forces utilizing power-hungry
propulsion, communications, sensors, and weapons[." It's [**increasingly
vital that the United States establish a more reliable supply chain of
critical minerals** and materials to diversify away from]{.mark} relying
on [China]{.mark}.]{.underline} Building a diverse supply chain of
critical minerals and materials will [[require a **major policy
shift**]{.underline}]{.mark}---[[including a focus on bolstering the
production of critical minerals we have here in the United
States]{.underline}]{.mark}. Domestic production alone will not meet the
growing demand the United States has for critical minerals. The United
States simply does not have the natural resources domestically and is
not positioned to match the growing processing-capacity domination of
China. [China's [marketplace domination is increasingly a national
security risk to the United States. Beijing could]{.mark} and most
likely will, when it's advantageous, [abuse its market power to reduce
or even cut off the United States' access to key critical minerals,
leaving us without the ability to create next-generation battery
technologies that are necessary for advanced military
operations.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[In [late 2020]{.mark}, a [Chinese submersible]{.mark}, the
[Fendouzhe]{.mark}, [descended]{.mark} over 30,000 feet [to]{.mark} the
bottom of the [Marianas Trench]{.mark}, home to the deepest point in the
earth's oceans, known as Challenger Deep.]{.underline} Loaded with so
much surveying equipment that the crew added additional buoyancy
materials to keep it balanced, the Fendouzhe set a national record for
the depth of its dive and broadcast a live feed of its exploits back to
China. [While the expedition was billed as focusing on the animal life
of the Trench, state [media noted that]{.mark} the [surveying
experience]{.mark} would be [useful for **China's growing
interest**]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [d]{.mark}eep-[s]{.mark}ea
[m]{.mark}ining.]{.underline} The deep seabed, essentially the very
bottom of the ocean's floor, is a potentially rich source of oil and
gas; elements like cobalt, copper, and nickel, as well as of the rare
earth elements (REEs) required for many new technologies. [Chinese
[President Xi]{.mark} Jinping has [spoken repeatedly of]{.mark} the
[connection between **"utilization of the ocean"** and]{.mark} [China's
quest for]{.mark} both **[maritime and]{.mark}** overall **[national
power]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [[In 2016]{.mark}, [he spoke]{.mark}
[specifically]{.mark} of the deep sea, saying: "[the deep sea]{.mark}
[contains treasures]{.mark} that remain undiscovered and undeveloped,
and [in order to obtain]{.mark} these treasures [we have to **control
key technologies**]{.mark} in getting into the deep sea,
[discover]{.mark}ing the deep sea, [and develop]{.mark}ing [the deep
sea]{.mark}."]{.underline} Policy has followed rhetoric. In February
2016, China began laying the predicate for exploitation of deep seabed
resources with the passage of the PRC Law on Exploration and Development
of Resources in Deep Sea Seabed Areas. In the 12th (2011-2015) and 13th
(2016-2020) Five Year Plans, China prioritized "promoting
commercialization of deep-sea mining, manufacturing of deep-sea
equipment and utilization of deep-sea bioresources." [[Beijing
already]{.mark} [leads the world]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the [number of
deep-sea mining contracts]{.mark} undertaken, with more likely to follow
given the breadth of its surveying efforts and the level of interest
shown by senior Chinese Communist Party officials]{.underline}. Beijing
is following a familiar pattern in its focus on the deep seabed.
[[Senior officials]{.mark} are [publicly extolling]{.mark} the [economic
importance of dominance in]{.mark} a particular **[underutilized
domain]{.mark},** and [connecting it]{.mark} explicitly [to China's
broader role]{.mark} in the world.]{.underline} Xi has pursued similar
approaches in the Arctic and Antarctic, declaring China a "Polar Great
Power" in 2014[. China's [2018 Arctic Strategy]{.mark} [declared Beijing
a **"near-Arctic"**]{.mark} **[power]{.mark}**, with an accompanying
"Polar Silk Road" designed to accelerate Chinese economic influence in
the region.]{.underline} In the Antarctic, meanwhile, Chinese officials
have spoken regularly of the resource exploitation potential of the
continent, despite the Antarctic Treaty's (of which China is a
signatory) constraints on extractive activities. Chinese scholars have
gone so far as to propagate the myth of the 2048 expiration of the
Madrid Protocol that governs Antarctic environmental conduct, against
all evidence and contrary to international consensus. For his part, Xi
has publicly called on China to "exploit" the Antarctic. As in the
Arctic and Antarctic, [[China's interest]{.mark} in economic dominance
of the deep seabed [has a significant military component]{.mark}. [In
2018,]{.mark} a [Ministry of National Defense document
identified]{.mark} the [domains relevant to]{.mark} the People's
Liberation Army (PLA) for [future global
operations]{.mark}]{.underline}. In addition to traditional domains like
land, air, sea, and space, [the [document called for]{.mark}
"[confrontation]{.mark} activities" [in]{.mark}]{.underline} areas
including quantum, artificial intelligence, and, [revealingly, [the deep
sea]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Science of Strategy]{.mark}, a premier
Chinese military journal connected to its National Defense University,
[noted]{.mark} the **economic value** of the deep seabed as early as
2015 and spoke of "[military struggle]{.mark} in the deep sea" [as a
**future warfare domain**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Revisions to the
country's National Security Law that year also flagged the deep seabed
as an area of national interest for Beijing. [[Chinese dominance]{.mark}
of the deep seabed, whether [in]{.mark} already-[disputed waters]{.mark}
[like the S]{.mark}outh and East [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}eas or farther
afield in the Western Pacific, where China has conducted **extensive
surveying**, including near U.S. territories like Guam and the
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, [poses]{.mark} significant
[**military challenges** for the U.S.]{.mark} and its
allies]{.underline}. As retired U.S. Navy Captain James Fanell, formerly
the Director of Intelligence for the U.S. Pacific Fleet, recently told
me: "[The [PRC's deep seabed]{.mark} survey [operations]{.mark} [have
two purposes]{.mark}. [One]{.mark}, and the one most publicized, is to
find and [exploit natural resources]{.mark} and the [other]{.mark} is to
[collect]{.mark} oceanographic [data for]{.mark} the Chinese Communist
Party's strategic goal of [expanding]{.mark} the geographic area and
[lethality of]{.mark} [the PLA]{.mark} Navy['s **blue-water submarine
force**]{.mark}]{.underline}." Fanell has noted that such operations
provide the PLA Navy with oceanographic data on the bottom contours,
water temperature, salinity, and other metrics of what the Chinese call
the "ocean battlespace environment" (海战场环境). [This type of
information [facilitates]{.mark} the PLA Navy's [objective of
neutralizing]{.mark} one of the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates[']{.mark} [longtime warfare advantage]{.mark}s: [control
of the undersea]{.mark} domain.]{.underline} The current international
mechanism for regulating the deep seabed is the International Seabed
Authority (ISA), created under the United Nations Convention on the Law
of the Sea (UNCLOS). The U.S. is not a party to either arrangement and
for good reason. [Not only is [China]{.mark} the largest financier of
the ISA, but its [institutional framework]{.mark} remains
[heavily]{.mark} [weighted **against**]{.mark} both [U.S. economic and
strategic interests]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Senate has consistently
failed to ratify U.S. membership in UNCLOS and ISA out of concerns about
sovereignty and the efficacy of either mechanism in upholding American
interests. The United States will most effectively counter Beijing's
deep seabed activities by working proactively with like-minded states,
including "Quad" members Australia, Japan, and India and trusted
partners like Taiwan, to monitor China's activities and respond
accordingly. Attempts to exploit the deep seabed economically in ways
contrary to international best practices, or to militarize it, should be
strongly condemned. An allied strategy to defend the deep seabed from
Beijing's predations requires, as in the Polar regions, both an economic
and military response, realizing the intrinsic linkage between them in
Chinese statecraft. [Like the Arctic strategies created by the U.S.
government in recent years, [a]{.mark} similar **[unified
document]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} the [deep seabed would assist in]{.mark}
coordinating [efforts]{.mark} across economic, scientific, and military
agencies and focusing attention on China's ambitions and its challenge
to American interests. [Additional intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance resources]{.mark} must be devoted to
**[prevent]{.mark}ing [unmonitored Chinese]{.mark}** deep-sea
[surveying]{.mark} [in U.S.]{.mark} territorial [waters]{.mark},
exclusive economic zones ([EEZs]{.mark}), or the waters or EEZs of the
three Freely Associated States (FAS) for whose defense the U.S. is
responsible]{.underline}. Allies like Japan and Australia can play
important roles in monitoring Beijing's activity in their backyards. As
China continues to expand its activities across numerous domains, and
its economic and military aspirations became ever more intertwined, the
U.S. and its partners must adapt and respond accordingly. [[The deep
seabed]{.mark}, like the Arctic and Antarctic before it, [will]{.mark}
[increasingly become an area of **Great Power competition**]{.mark}
[requiring]{.mark} Washington's attention and a [clear strategy for the
preservation of U.S. interests]{.mark}.]{.underline}

CHINA IS DOMINATING THE MINING AND REFINING MARKETS OF RARE EARTH
MAGNETS

[[China's dominance in]{.mark} the [rare earth]{.mark} magnets [market
is a significant concern for the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and
other countries, [as a complete ban on exports could have serious
implications]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Rare earth magnets make up a
small portion of China's overall exports to the United States and other
nations. [[Halting shipments would]{.mark} likely [have minimal economic
impact on China]{.mark} [but could cause significant disruption
internationally]{.mark}, given that China produces the majority of the
world's rare earth magnets.]{.underline} In the long term, these types
of export restrictions could adversely affect the Chinese economy.
However, in the [[short term, they can be used as powerful negotiation
tools]{.underline}]{.mark}. As illustrated in the graph below in 2023,
[[China accounted for 61% of global mining of rare earth magnet elements
and for 92% of global refining of rare earth]{.mark} magnet
[elements]{.mark}]{.underline} (these figures do not take into account
the new export restrictions). The current situation threatens years of
efforts to build global supply chains for critical minerals and
highlights the West's challenge to reduce dependence on China. Building
infrastructure to reduce reliance on China would take years and would
involve extensive research, permits and construction. Higher prices
might encourage investment in new mines and facilities, but investors
may hesitate due to China's ability to flood the market and lower
prices. \

THE NEW RESTRICTIONS ON HEAVY RARE EARTHS COULD HAVE A DETRIMENTAL
IMPACT ON MULTIPLE SECTORS

China's recent suspensions of exports of critical minerals have the
potential to significantly impact the automotive industry. These
minerals are essential for manufacturing various automotive components,
particularly in electric vehicles and advanced electronics. [[Heavy rare
earth magnets are crucial for many types of electric motors, while
critical minerals such as graphite are key components in lithium-ion
batteries]{.mark} used in electrical vehicles]{.underline}. Shortages of
these materials and delays in their delivery could raise production
costs for electrical vehicle batteries and motors, and slow down
production for smaller motors, speakers, camera lenses and LEDs, which
are also used in automotive manufacturing. The requirement for special
export licences could further complicate and slow down supply chains.
These measures could potentially have a detrimental impact on a sector
already facing challenges, such as competition from cheap and
competitive electrical vehicles from China and the Trump
administration's trade policies.

Besides the impact on the automotive sector, [[the lack of
substitutability of those materials risks disrupting supply chains of
other products, such as wind turbines, semiconductors, loudspeakers,
computer hard drives, television and computer screens, jet engines,
medical devices like laser surgery materials and MRI scanners, as well
as key defence technologies]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### China's [delayed approval]{.underline} of requests demonstrates their [continued weaponization]{.underline} of [rare-earth magnets]{.underline} even after export restrictions were "paused."

[China makes 90% of the world's most powerful rare-earth
magnets]{.underline}, a key component in everything from cars to jet
fighters.

[Two weeks [after China promised]{.mark} the [U.S. it would]{.mark}
[ease]{.mark} the [exports of rare-earth magnets]{.mark}, [Chinese
authorities]{.mark} are [dragging out approval of Western]{.mark}
[companies' requests]{.mark} for the critical components, a situation
that could reignite trade tensions between Washington and
Beijing]{.underline}.

[Western companies [say they are receiving]{.mark} [barely enough
magnets]{.mark} for their factories [and have **little visibility** of
**future supplies**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Firms are waiting weeks as
Chinese authorities scrutinize their applications---only to be rejected
in some cases. And applications for raw rare earths, which are used to
make magnets, are rarely granted.

As a result, [[Western companies]{.mark} are [concerned]{.mark} that the
[shortages]{.mark} could [soon affect
manufacturing]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Companies are [so desperate]{.mark}
for magnets [that they]{.mark} are [opt]{.mark}ing [for **expensive
airfreight**]{.mark} [when]{.mark}ever [licenses are granted]{.mark} [to
prevent]{.mark} costly production [shutdowns]{.mark}. Some manufacturers
are experimenting with workarounds that would allow them to make their
products without the most powerful magnets.]{.underline}

"It's hand to mouth---the normal supply-chain scrambling that you have
to do," said Lisa Drake, a vice president overseeing Ford's industrial
planning for batteries and electric vehicles, earlier this week.
[Although she said the situation had improved, the [scarcity of]{.mark}
the [rare-earth]{.mark} magnet[s]{.mark} is [forc]{.mark}ing [Ford to
**"move things around"** to avoid]{.mark} factory [shutdowns]{.mark},
she said.]{.underline}

[Manufacturers have taken the continuing challenges as a sign that new
[Chinese rare-earth **export restrictions**]{.mark}]{.underline},
introduced in April after President Trump raised tariffs on China,
**[[are here to stay]{.underline}]{.mark}**---contrary to White House
assertions that the flow of the critical components would return to
normal.

"[Yes, the [export restrictions]{.mark} have been [paused on
paper]{.mark}. [However]{.mark}, ground [reality is **completely
different**]{.mark}]{.underline}," said Neha Mukherjee, a rare-earths
analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. [The [licensing
process]{.mark} is [plagued by "**bureaucratic
drag**]{.mark}."]{.underline}

China's Ministry of Commerce said Thursday that it has been accelerating
the review of rare-earth export license applications and has approved "a
certain number."

The supply of rare minerals such as gadolinium is tightly controlled by
China.

[The [restrictions illustrate]{.mark} the [power Beijing holds through
its]{.mark} formidable [supply chains and]{.mark} how it can
[use]{.mark} them [to **inflict pain**]{.mark} on Western businesses
[and **exact concessions**]{.mark} from the U.S.]{.underline}

China makes 90% of the world's most powerful rare-earth magnets, a key
component in everything from cars to jet fighters. In April, after Trump
heaped stiff tariffs on Chinese products, Beijing established an
export-control system for rare earths. While it said the license system
was set up to regulate the export of materials for military use, the
regime has in effect allowed China to clamp down on rare-earths supplies
as it wishes.

After April, the supply of magnets to Western businesses slowed to a
trickle, causing shock waves for global car, defense and electronics
makers. Exports of rare-earth magnets to the U.S. declined 93% in May
from a year earlier. Ford stopped production of its Explorer SUV at its
Chicago plant for a week in May.

The U.S. accused China of slow-walking the approval of export licenses,
which China denied. The shortage drove both sides back to the bargaining
table earlier this month, where China agreed to free up the flow of rare
earths in exchange for the U.S. easing its own restrictions on certain
U.S. exports to China.

Following the deal, Trump wrote that "full magnets, and any necessary
rare earths, will be supplied up front by China."

However, China put only a six-month limit on any new licenses, The Wall
Street Journal has reported. Now, in the applications for export
licenses, [[Chinese authorities]{.mark} are [asking Western
companies]{.mark} [for **sensitive details**]{.mark} such as [contact
info]{.mark}rmation of those buying their magnets [and even
designs]{.mark} of how their magnets are integrated into components like
motors.]{.underline}

[Chinese authorities [justify]{.mark} the scrutiny [as necessary to
ensure]{.mark} the [magnets aren't used for military purposes]{.mark},
say companies involved in the magnet trade.]{.underline}

[The [U.S.]{.mark} has [accused China of **slow-walking**]{.mark} the
[**approval** of export licenses]{.mark}, which China has
denied.]{.underline}

When companies skip certain questions on their magnet applications to
avoid disclosing sensitive intellectual property or details of
commercial arrangements, their applications languish or are denied. In
some cases, the applicants have then been told to start over and include
all of the required information in a new application, which takes 45
days to process, according to companies involved in rare-earth imports.

["**[The control is real]{.mark}**," said a representative of one such
company. "There are thousands of applications the \[Chinese authorities
have\] received."]{.underline}

Earlier this month, Germany's main industry association called on the
country's new government to push China to ease the approval process.
"German industry needs to be able to plan in the near term. Licensing
procedures must not be used as a means of exerting political pressure,"
it said.

[[Beijing]{.mark} also appears to be [trying to **prevent stockpiling**
by Western businesses]{.mark}]{.underline}. One Chinese magnet maker has
warned clients seeking to import more magnets than usual that they may
have to explain to government officials the "business drivers" behind
such large orders, according to an advisory note the magnet maker shared
with clients.

[Fearful of shortages, many [Western businesses]{.mark} are
[complying]{.mark} with the information requests---[but]{.mark} are
[still **facing long delays**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The success of their
application also depends on their supplier. Big state-connected magnet
companies are getting export licenses faster than smaller private ones,
according to many in the industry.

"The export policy for magnet\[s\] is still very strict," said a
representative for one Chinese magnet maker. Now, some Western
businesses say they are resigned to the fact that the restrictions may
remain in place indefinitely.

Some private Chinese magnet makers, who are under significant financial
pressure due to the export controls, are working with clients to find
workarounds. For instance, some are encouraging foreign clients to buy
less-powerful magnets that don't include any controlled rare earths.
Some Chinese companies are also working to develop stronger magnets that
don't rely on restricted materials such as dysprosium and terbium.

But [**[swapping out]{.mark}** the most powerful and heat-resistant
[magnets **is often impossible**]{.mark} [for]{.mark} the [auto and
electronics industries]{.mark}, [which rely on]{.mark} [magnets to
efficiently power motors]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Olive Lien, an expert in semiconductor-cooling technology based in
Taiwan, said many companies in recent months have been struggling to
acquire rare-earth magnets needed for some high-end fan motors used in
products such as AI servers and other high-performance computing
systems. [Many [companies]{.mark} have been [forced to redesign]{.mark}
their products, such as by [switch]{.mark}ing [to cheaper]{.mark} and
more readily available ferrite [magnets]{.mark}, [which are less]{.mark}
[powerful]{.mark}.]{.underline}

One U.S. magnet importer said that while two licensing applications he
was involved with were recently approved, others are dragging. "The
system is slow and burdensome," he said. "Very detailed and confusing
for the applicants."

When automobile-parts companies do get their licenses approved, they are
paying extra to rush the magnets to factories by air, costs which are
often ultimately borne by the carmakers.

"These are the things you don't hear about, how much money it is taking
to keep these factories running, you know, limping along," the magnet
importer said.

China's Role in Spreading Surveillance Technology

[When it comes to digital authoritarianism, China exerts most of its
influence in the area of **surveillance**]{.underline}. [Chinese
companies]{.underline}, such as Huawei, [are setting up advanced "safe
city" platforms, offering facial recognition and intelligent video
surveillance systems to **repressive governments**]{.underline}, and
providing advanced analytic capabilities.

I recently undertook research on the global expansion of AI
surveillance. [AI-based surveillance offers many unique advantages over
conventional tools. It enhances cost efficiencies, decreases reliance on
security forces, and allows authorities to "cast a much wider net than
traditional methods."]{.underline} Throughout my research, I focused on
three questions: Which countries are adopting AI surveillance
technology? What specific types of AI surveillance are governments
deploying? Which countries and companies are supplying this technology?

Governments in at least 75 of the 176 countries I surveyed deploy AI
surveillance capabilities. [They do so in three forms --- safe city
platforms, facial recognition systems, and smart policing. Chinese
firms, led by Huawei, are the **leading suppliers** of AI surveillance
tech used for public security worldwide]{.underline}. However, Chinese
companies are not operating in isolation. Firms based in the United
States, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, and Israel are also
key suppliers of public security surveillance.

The presence of AI surveillance technology does not mean that
governments are using such technology for illegitimate purposes. The
data simply indicates that these countries have a capability to
undertake extensive surveillance if they so choose. Accordingly, liberal
democracies with strong rule of law traditions and institutional checks
and balances are far less likely to exploit this technology for
repressive purposes.

This raises an important follow-on question --- in how many countries is
China the main provider of AI surveillance for public security? Using
data collected in the Carnegie report, I found that in 24 countries
worldwide, Chinese firms appear to be the primary suppliers of AI
surveillance technology to their respective governments. The appendix
presents the full list of countries.

[Of these 24 countries, many exhibit governance deficiencies --- most
are classified as hybrid regimes]{.underline}. They tend to share close
geopolitical ties with China; [14 of 24 countries are members of the
Belt and Road Initiative]{.underline}. [Regionally, countries in
Sub-Saharan Africa are overrepresented with eight countries on the
list.]{.underline} Finally, the group's economic influence is small.
South Africa leads the pack, ranking 33 out of 180 countries on 2017
global GDP. Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan cluster at the bottom
--- ranked 133, 147, and 151, respectively.

Implications

Many of the 24 countries would not be able to access advanced
surveillance technology without China's help. For these governments,
[China provides crucial equipment that enables security agencies to
monitor citizens and disrupt political challenges as
needed]{.underline}. In certain situations, Chinese companies are
directly working on behalf of like-minded autocratic regimes. For
example, Huawei employees have helped Ugandan and Zambian authorities
spy on political opponents by intercepting communications, penetrating
computers, and deploying location-tracking applications.

[In exchange, China gains political influence, increases its economic
leverage, and may even receive intelligence advantages]{.underline}
(e.g., the African Union headquarters built by China were implanted with
bugs that siphoned confidential data to Chinese authorities nightly from
2012 to 2017). [Undoubtedly, **membership** in this group will
**increase** in the coming years, representing an **ominous sign** about
future trends of digital repression.]{.underline}

[The American war machine depends on tiny bits of metal, some as small
as dimes. [Rare-earth magnets]{.mark} are [needed for F-35 jet
fighters]{.mark}, missile-guidance systems, [Predator drones and
**nuclear submarines**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The problem: [China makes most of the world's rare-earth
magnets]{.mark}, with **[92% of]{.mark}** the **[global market
share]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Now, Washington is doling out hundreds of millions of dollars in grants
and tax credits to revive magnet-making in America. Defense
manufacturers are on a clock.

[A U.S. law in 2018 restricted the use of made-in-China magnets in
American military equipment, shriveling the list of potential suppliers
to a small number in Japan and the West. [By 2027]{.mark}, the
[curbs]{.mark} will [extend to magnets]{.mark} made anywhere that
contain materials [mined or processed in China]{.mark}, [covering
**nearly all**]{.mark} of **the [current global
supply]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

After three decades of post-Cold War deindustrialization, rebuilding the
industry---against China's market heft---is an uphill battle, even with
government help. Only one company in the U.S. is in production of the
dominant type of rare-earth magnet.

"We're not going to be able to simply flip a switch and get to where we
want to be," said Anthony Di Stasio, a senior U.S. defense official.
"The only thing that you can really judge success on right now is how
many positive ripples have you made from throwing the rock into the
lake."

The office Di Stasio runs in the Defense Department is diving into
supply chains to invest in the pieces and parts that make the military
work. Much of what they invest in is processing minerals and making
metals, betting that regardless of how, for example, submarine
technology evolves, the same building blocks will be needed.

"Let's go as close to the dirt as we can so we know we're still going to
need it in 15 years," said Di Stasio.

The Defense Department in the past few years has committed more than
\$450 million toward rare earths and the magnets they power. The Energy
Department is offering its own incentives because the magnets are also
critical for electric vehicles.

The funding is helping a German magnet-maker set up its first North
American factory, which broke ground in March, two decades after its
last U.S. factory shut down. The facility, in Sumter, S.C., will buy
rare earths locally. Those supplies could come from other projects that
are receiving government funding---such as processing plants coming up
in California and Texas, owned by American and Australian miners,
respectively.

[Their [highest hurdle is low Chinese prices]{.mark}. A U.S. Commerce
Department probe in 2022 found that **[China]{.mark}'s dominant
position** enabled it to [set prices low enough]{.mark} to [make

In China, [[digital authoritarianism emerged during]{.mark} the late
19[90's]{.mark} [with]{.mark} their "**[Great
Firewall]{.mark}**",]{.underline} a nation wide system that prevents
Chinese citizens from accessing many foreign sites. The "Great Firewall"
[[employs]{.mark} many different types of [censorship across]{.mark} the
[Chinese]{.mark}- based [internet]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although a
massive phenomenon, the limits of the firewall have not been clearly
defined due to the inability of researchers to find a viable amount of
clients to "test connectivity." China was the origin of digital age
censorship with its "Great Firewall" and high-tech suppression recently
implemented in Xinjiang, where a combination of digital technologies,
such as artificial intelligence and facial recognition, were used to
surveil, manipulate, and control the population in the area.

[[China]{.mark} has also [advanced]{.mark} the [censorship]{.mark} of
the Chinese population [with]{.mark} their **[social credit
system]{.mark}**, [which]{.mark} has the ability to [sanction
and]{.mark} **publicly [shame]{.mark}** [individuals]{.mark} for [not
subscrib]{.mark}ing [to]{.mark} the [C]{.mark}hinese [C]{.mark}ommunist
[P]{.mark}arty's political [ideology]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Due to Beijing's]{.mark} extensive [experience]{.mark} using digital
tools for domestic censorship and surveillance, [they have
become]{.mark} the [**main supplier** for]{.mark} several authoritarian
[regimes looking to build]{.mark} their [own surveillance system,
exporting]{.mark} surveillance and monitoring systems [to **at least 18
countries**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [**[growing]{.mark}
[export]{.mark}** [of new tech]{.mark}nologies and development of new
methodologies by China [signals a **global shift**]{.mark}]{.underline},
one in which authoritarian regimes are leveraging digital tools to
suppress the voice of individuals and shape global norms in their favor.

China's relationship with digital authoritarianism is expansive and
influential, as the country has implemented measures not only
domestically, but also internationally to keep its population under
control. [[Through]{.mark} the use of facial recognition, artificial
intelligence, and implementing **[strategic authoritarian
measures]{.mark}** on their population, [China]{.mark} has
[created]{.mark} a surveillance [system of **massive
scale**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the originator of digital
authoritarianism, China is a distinct model of digital authoritarianism
and supplier of surveillance technologies for other authoritarian
regimes.

\<\<PARGRAPH CONDENSED\>\>

Russia Russia's engagement with digital authoritarianism began in the
early 2000s with adaptations of Soviet-era surveillance technologies for
the digital age. Just as the Chinese government made efforts to control
their population, Russia followed similar footsteps. In 2014, Russia
began making both legal and technical moves to establish a so-called
'sovereign internet,' modeled after China's approach. If successful, the
Russian government would be able to, at least partially, isolate the
Russian internet from the rest of the world. Beyond censorship, Russian
companies export surveillance and hacking technologies, especially to
post-Soviet states. Russia's exportation of digital surveillance goods
can diminish and suppress the voices of citizens that speak negatively
about the Russian government. Although there is a need for further study
into the government's direct involvement in this export of surveillance
technologies, the exportation of technology used for digital
authoritarian measures poses a threat to democracy because it enables
other governments to engage in digital authoritarianism and censorship.
In conjunction with China, the Russian exportation of digital
surveillance technologies shines a light on a troubling global trend. As
new governments adopt these digital authoritarian practices, democratic
ideals erode in global society. This creates a world in which freedoms
are undermined rather than promoted to consolidate power. This
connection between China and Russia signals a growing challenge to
democratic norms on a global scale, potentially creating a future where
government-based digital control is normal. Iran Following revolutionary
turmoil in 1979 and war against Iraq, Iran's Islamic republic was
established. This regime is openly authoritarian, as shown by the
blatant repression and imposition of constraints on civil liberties.
Iran's adoption of digital surveillance methods emerged with the rise of
the internet during the 2000s as part of its broader strategy of
political repression. Iran has a past riddled with censorship and
repressing human rights activists and journalists. Iran's security
agencies rely on rudimentary technical expertise and human information
gathering to track political activities both within and beyond their
borders, enabling them to plan retaliatory or preventive actions. While
not all tactics in this repressive toolkit are new, digital surveillance
increases the impact and reach of potential threats against
"transnational activists and their networks". When Iran enhanced its
capacities for internet control in 2009, protests ignited by digital
media caused the regime to take steps to censor and control the
population. Authorities began blocking websites and arresting critical
bloggers as early as the early 2000s. As circumvention and anonymization
tools evolved, the Iranian government adopted more aggressive tactics,
such as deep packet inspection, hacking opposition media, and conducting
targeted surveillance. The Other online communities who are considered
to transgress official norms were also targeted. In 2014, for instance,
six young Iranians were detained for circulating a home-made music video
with an interpretation of Pharrell Williams' song "Happy". These efforts
were aimed at controlling the population and suppressing dissent through
digital authoritarianism.

KYIV --- [[Russia]{.mark} is [catching up to Ukraine]{.mark} in drone
production [thanks to]{.mark}]{.underline} greater financial resources,
production lines far from the front lines and [especially help from
[China]{.mark}, a **senior Ukrainian official** told
POLITICO.]{.underline}

"[Chinese [manufacturers provide]{.mark} them with [hardware,

microcircuits, processor modules, antenna field systems, control boards,
navigation. They use so-called shell [companies, **change
names**]{.mark}, do everything to avoid being subject to export control
[and **avoid sanctions** for their activities]{.mark}]{.underline},"
said Oleh Aleksandrov, spokesperson for the Ukrainian Foreign
Intelligence Service. "Yet officially, China sticks to all the rules.
Yet only officially."

[[Beijing]{.mark} has [repeatedly denied]{.mark}]{.underline} supplying
any drones or weapons components to Russia, calling Ukrainian protests
"[[baseless accusations]{.mark} and political manipulation.\"
[But]{.mark} Aleksandrov said [Russia has]{.mark} a [**critical
dependency** on]{.mark} the [**supply** of Chinese spare parts
for]{.mark} both tactical and long-range
**[drones]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[[That]{.mark} is [allow]{.mark}ing [Russia to **erode Ukraine\'s lead**
in drone tech]{.mark}nology [and production]{.mark}]{.underline} ---
something that helped keep Ukraine in the fight at times when it was
suffering from ammunition shortages and slow weapons deliveries from its
allies.

Drones replace shells

Pavlo Palisa, a former top military commander and now deputy head of
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office, said in a statement
that so far this year, 80 percent of the damage to Russia\'s equipment
and personnel has been done with drones. In May alone, Ukrainian drones
destroyed 89,000 Russian targets.

Ukraine managed to claim leadership in drone warfare in the first years
of war, producing up to 1 million tactical drones in 2024 and aiming to
produce 2.5 million tactical and 30,000 long-range strike drones in
2025.

But Russia is catching up.

[[Ukraine produces]{.mark} about [100]{.mark} long-range drones [a
day]{.mark}, while [Russia has managed to scale up]{.mark} production
[to 300]{.mark} a day [and]{.mark} is [aiming for 500]{.mark}, Zelenskyy
told journalists in Kyiv last week.]{.underline}

Russian drone producers managed to boost long-range drone production
from 15,000 in 2024 to more than 30,000 this year, as well as up to 2
million small tactical drones, said Aleksandrov.

["The enemy is copying the experience of the Ukrainian Defense Forces
and is actively scaling its unmanned units. Therefore, we must maintain
the pace of development and **constantly increase** our **capabilities**
to be one step ahead," General Oleksandr Syrskyi, the Ukrainian army\'s
top commander, said in a statement last week.]{.underline}

Zelenskyy claimed that Russia has far more financial resources and also
has access to Chinese technology, such as its DJI Mavic drones,
originally developed for the civilian market but widely used by both
militaries in the war.

"They are so cheap and effective, they are used daily as artillery
shells," Zelenskyy said, adding that dozens of producers in Ukraine are
working on updated versions of the Mavic.

However, Kyiv says that its access to new drones has been curtailed by
China, while Beijing has placed no such restrictions on Russia.

["[The **Chinese Mavic**]{.mark} is [**open to**]{.mark} the
**[Russians]{.mark}**, and it is [closed to]{.mark} the
[Ukrainians]{.mark}. They simply **closed it for [Europe]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} for Ukraine, including for [the EU]{.mark}. And for the
Russians, there is still an opportunity to buy drones on the Chinese
market," Zelenskyy said.]{.underline}

The jobs in demand for deep-sea mining

[While still in its early stages, the deep-sea mining industry has begun
to define the [STEM jobs]{.mark} that are [growing in
demand]{.mark}]{.underline}. Let's take a look at the most in-demand
jobs right now:

Remote operated vehicle [[(ROVs)]{.mark} specialists]{.underline}: ROVs
play a crucial role in deep-sea mining. They are used for exploration,
surveying, and collecting minerals from the ocean floor. Professionals
skilled in operating, maintaining, and managing these vehicles are
essential.

Autonomous underwater vehicle [[(AUVs)
experts]{.underline}]{.mark}: Similar to ROVs, AUVs are essential for
mapping and exploring the seabed. Experts in AUV technology are needed
to develop, operate, and maintain these autonomous systems.

[Cutting and collecting [machine operators]{.mark}]{.underline}: These
machines extract minerals from the sea floor. Skilled operators who can
manage these complex machines are in high demand.

[[Pumping]{.mark} system [engineers]{.mark}]{.underline}: These
engineers are responsible for designing and maintaining the systems
transporting collected minerals to the surface.

[[Environmental scientists]{.underline}]{.mark}: Given the potential
ecological impacts of deep-sea mining, environmental scientists are
crucial for assessing and mitigating environmental risks. They play a
key role in ensuring sustainable and responsible mining practices.

[[Marine geologists and
oceanographers]{.underline}]{.mark}: Professionals in these fields are
essential for understanding the geology of the ocean floor and the
distribution of mineral deposits. Their expertise is critical in
identifying potential mining sites.

[[Robotics engineers]{.underline}]{.mark}: As a lot of the mining
equipment is remotely operated, experts in robotics and precise control
systems are crucial. They are responsible for the development and
maintenance of these sophisticated systems.

[[Data analysts]{.mark} and [GIS specialists]{.mark}]{.underline}: These
professionals are needed to analyse the vast amounts of data collected
from undersea explorations and to manage geographic information systems
(GIS) for mapping and planning mining operations.

[[Software engineers]{.underline}]{.mark}: They specialise in developing
and maintaining software. In the context of robotics, this would involve
programming the software that controls the robot.

#### Creates tens of thousands of jobs in all three economic sectors.

Alex **Gilbert 25** \[April 23, 2025; Alex Gilbert is vice president of

sea mining opportunity for America" from The Hill;
https://thehill.com/opinion/5261274-deep-ocean-mineral-frontier/\]//sarah

The Trump administration is preparing an historic executive order to
reassert American leadership on a new mineral frontier: the deep ocean
floor. [The order lays the [groundwork for]{.mark} a [new \$100+ billion
industrial sector]{.mark}, one that could [supply essential
materials]{.mark} for batteries, defense, aerospace and advanced
manufacturing [for decades]{.mark}]{.underline}. Congress should get
behind it.

[Seafloor minerals consist of essential metals like nickel, cobalt,
manganese and copper]{.underline}, all of which are on the critical
minerals list. Deep sea mining adapts technology from the offshore oil
and gas industry, an existing American competitive advantage. Additional
innovations like remote operated vehicles mean these [[minerals]{.mark}
can now be [extracted]{.mark} [economically]{.mark}]{.underline}.

A recent RAND report estimated the [new industry could [support tens of
thousands of jobs]{.mark} and [meet]{.mark} a [quarter of global metal
demand by 2040]{.mark}]{.underline}. New jobs will [[span]{.mark}
shipyards on the [Gulf Coast]{.mark}, ports in [Hawaii]{.mark} and the
[Pacific]{.mark}, metallurgical facilities in the [Rust Belt]{.mark},
and robotics hubs from [Houston]{.mark} to [Boston]{.mark}]{.underline}.
It's a national industrial lift that [[supports working-class jobs and
high-tech startups alike]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The move is bold, strategic, and necessary. China is already moving to
develop ocean resources to cement their hold on critical minerals. In
February, the communist nation signed a strategic deal with the Cook
Islands that aims to strategically wrest control of the Pacific from
U.S. influence.

[More broadly, seafloor resources are part of intensifying great power
competition over the seabed]{.underline}. China and Russia are expanding
their deep sea presence through undersea cable warfare, seabed
surveillance and military infrastructure. The Cook Islands lies directly
on the sea lines of communication between the United States and the
South Pacific, including submarine telecommunications lines that connect
us with Australia and New Zealand.

For over a decade, the International Seabed Authority, a paralyzed UN
body, has stalled on finalizing rules for commercial mining. This delay
has given China room to maneuver; they now hold the most ISA exploration
permits of any country and are pouring money into the industry.

[[America does not need UN permission to advance its strategic
interests]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The planned U.S. executive order reinvigorates a 1980 law, the Deep
Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act, that [[establishes]{.mark} U.S.
[licensing authority]{.mark} in the [N]{.mark}ational [O]{.mark}ceanic
and [A]{.mark}tmospheric [A]{.mark}dministration over seabed mining in
international waters]{.underline}. It is also likely to direct other
actions, including expedited permitting, onshoring processing supply
chains and even establishing a strategic national stockpile of seafloor
resources.

#### Increase in jobs defeats poverty.

[[Job creation]{.mark} is one of the [most effective]{.mark} ways [to

More than just a source of income, jobs [[provide]{.mark} people with a
[sense of dignity and purpose]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} They
[[unlock potential, empower women]{.mark}, engage [young people]{.mark},
and can make communities stronger]{.underline}. Investing in women\'s
economic opportunities, for instance, can have a multiplier effect on
decreasing poverty as women typically reinvest up to 90 percent of their
earnings into their families and communities.

A Three-Pillar Approach to Jobs

Creating more and better jobs will require scalable and sustainable
solutions. That's why jobs are at the core of the World Bank's Group's
approach to development. Partnering with governments and the private
sector around the world, we work with countries through the entire life
cycle of job creation, providing expertise, policy and technical
support, and helping to build enabling environments for sustainable
economic growth.

Since 2019, the World Bank\'s jobs-related efforts have benefited 77
million people. Our International Development Association (IDA)'s job
strategy has long helped drive job creation in low-income countries.

To ramp up these efforts, we established a High-Level Advisory Council
on Jobs and are making job creation an explicit aim of everything we do,
not just a by-product. The goal is to help countries build dynamic
private sectors that convert growth into local jobs, producing
opportunities where people already live, with a focus on women and
youth.

More specifically, we are taking a three-pillar approach, which includes
[[establishing the foundational infrastructure necessary for
jobs]{.underline}]{.mark}, working with governments to [[strengthen
governance and support]{.mark} business-enabling [policies]{.mark} and a
predictable regulatory environment]{.underline}, and [[mobilizing
private capital]{.underline}]{.mark}. To achieve this, the World Bank
Group is working with governments, the private sector, international
financial institutions, and other partners to provide policy and
advisory support, financing, and knowledge.

**nuclear energy**]{.mark} to decarbonize.]{.underline} The continued
growth of electricity-intensive sectors, including advanced
manufacturing and data centers that support artificial intelligence (AI)
workloads, places huge demands on national energy grids. To help meet
growing demand, [technology companies have made **large commitments** to
future nuclear expansion and brought retired nuclear power plants back
online]{.underline}, including the infamous Three Mile Island station.
[The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) predicts that **[global
nuclear power generation will double by 2050]{.mark}**]{.underline},
including next-generation reactor technologies, to combat energy
insecurity and meet net-zero emissions targets. Four executive
orders recently signed by President Trump aim to accelerate the
deployment of advanced nuclear reactors, but the orders also contain
provisions that could weaken nuclear safety measures.

At the same time, the nuclear nonproliferation regime is fraying.
[Heightened NATO doubts about U.S. defense commitments and growing
security concerns in the Indo-Pacific have raised the risks of allied
nuclear proliferation]{.underline}. The global system of treaties,
norms, and practices that constitute the nonproliferation regime,
centered on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
(NPT), has decayed as nuclear weapons---and [the threat of obtaining
them]{.underline}---[have increasingly factored into regional conflicts.
As a result, a [shift to nuclear energy]{.mark} sources [in response to
the climate crisis]{.mark} **may further [amplify nuclear
proliferation]{.mark}** risks if states fail to prioritize responsible
export practices. ]{.underline}

The Changing Nuclear Energy Climate

The 2015 Paris Climate Accords, adopted by nearly 200 countries and
embraced by a host of non-state stakeholders, set a goal to limit global
temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius and keep "well below" a 2-degree
rise by achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. As part of the
ongoing Paris Agreement process, 20 states (including the United States)
recently declared their commitment to triple nuclear energy capacity in
the next three decades. A 2021 report commissioned by the United Nations
found that nuclear power stations emit lower average lifecycle
emissions (5.13 g CO2 eq/KWh) than offshore wind (7.8 g CO2 eq/KWh) and
solar energy (8 -- 23 g CO2 eq/KWh) sources and can also backstop
standard energy grids to address fluctuations in solar and wind energy
output. European countries, which have continued to levy sanctions on
Russian energy despite the sudden thaw in U.S.-Russian relations, eye
greater nuclear capacity as a means of weaning the continent from
its reliance on fossil fuel imports. However, the construction of large
nuclear power stations equipped with current-generation
reactors entails steep upfront costs for advanced economies. Moreover,
climate activists have pushed back against the use of nuclear power to
meet climate targets, and scholars have cautioned about
the non-democratic and colonial associations of the global nuclear
industry. As stakeholders debate the right way to integrate nuclear
energy into climate solutions, the changing climate is complicating the
national security implications of nuclear technology.

stockpile, found that [climate change-related [threats could]{.mark}
"[impact the reliability and resilience of]{.mark} unique and critical
NNSA [capabilities and infrastructure]{.mark}.]{.underline}" A major
Texas wildfire in 2024 forced the evacuation of the Pantex plant, the
United States' primary nuclear weapons assembly and disassembly
facility. [Extreme weather events and rising sea levels can also
have "mission-altering" impacts on the readiness of each leg of the U.S.
nuclear triad]{.underline}---these effects include challenges servicing
the Atlantic U.S. ballistic missile submarine fleet, the accessibility
of Minuteman III international ballistic missile (ICBM) silos, and risks
of temperature and precipitation to the only base that hosts U.S.
stealth bombers. 

[[Competition between]{.mark} the [nuclear-armed states]{.mark} facing
the most severe climate stress [heightens escalation risks and nuclear
security challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}. In early May 2025, India and
Pakistan fought a four-day conflict that saw air, drone, and missile
strikes exchanged in the wake of a terrorist attack in
India-administered Jammu and Kashmir. Both countries have embarked on
nuclear modernization programs to manage vulnerabilities at multiple
rungs of the escalation ladder. Pakistan's "full spectrum deterrence"
posture explicitly maintains a low threshold for nuclear use to offset
India's superiority in conventional weapons. India has worked to deploy
capabilities that enable it to pursue a flexible counterforce
strategy to preempt a Pakistani attack. These developments in nuclear
posture create high crisis instability risks in a highly
climate-vulnerable region. South Asia faces acute climate impacts, with
the region's complex topography contributing to unpredictable
precipitation patterns, heat stress, flash flooding, and rising sea
levels. India suspended the Indus War Treaty at the onset of the most
recent crisis, and ceasefire terms did not reverse this action.
Increased seasonal volatility from climate-induced glacier melt will
only further intensify disagreements over water storage and damming of
the Indus River Basin, providing a "central pathway" for water scarcity
to intensify the bitter rivalry between Delhi and Islamabad. 

[Water disputes also factor into the complex trilateral
dynamics]{.underline} between India, Pakistan, and the People's Republic
of China (PRC). The unprecedented buildup in the quantity and diversity
of the PRC's nuclear forces has not gone unnoticed by the subcontinent.
Worse still, India-PRC [[tensions have **historically erupted** into
border wars]{.underline}]{.mark}. The latest clashes in 2020 over
disputed borders in the Himalayas fit into a broader, tense strategic
competition---Delhi and Beijing have vied for influence over smaller
states in the region, and India has long been concerned about being
cornered by the alliance between the PRC and Pakistan. India and the PRC
are likely to expand their rivalry into the Brahmaputra River basin.
While water scarcity alone will not trigger a conflict, it will no doubt
exacerbate an already-precarious situation. 

Small Modular Reactors: A Risky Energy Enrichment

Although the urgency of the climate crisis calls for the aggressive
implementation of new energy solutions, the [advent of Small Modular
Reactors ([SMRs]{.mark}) may [raise]{.mark} global proliferation risks
if not implemented cautiously]{.underline}. SMRs have drawn
high-profile public and private investments and piqued the interest of
stakeholders from domestic technology companies to Southeast Asian
nations eager to cooperate with the United States. The benefits of SMRs
are hard to deny. Owing to their smaller scale and standardized
manufacturing, SMR production can be scaled to lower building times and
upfront costs compared to traditional nuclear reactors. Moreover, these
plants can serve remote communities, be installed into former fossil
fuel plant sites, and are designed with advanced passive
safety measures. 

However, many SMR designs require high-assay low-enriched
uranium (HALEU), with an enrichment level from 5% to 20%. This lowers
the barrier for countries that operate SMRs to pursue weapons-grade
material and may increase the burden for verification and safeguards
measures. Further concerns have been raised over SMR designs that use
plutonium fuel, exports of which could raise long-standing risks of
diversion for weapons programs. Though the exact proliferation
implications of SMR exports are still uncertain, historical exports of
certain reactor designs---particularly heavy-water moderated research
reactors ideal for plutonium production---have been a key enabler of
nuclear weapons programs. This ought to instill greater emphasis on
ensuring SMR exports serve peaceful purposes. 

A Looming Age of Nuclear Latency

[Potential proliferators have also grown more interested in developing
nuclear latency.]{.underline} A form of strategic hedging, nuclear
latency involves the acquisition of "some or all" of the technologies,
infrastructure, and expertise needed to develop nuclear weapons short of
a decision to pursue a weapon. Some countries have achieved latency
without actively working toward a weapon. Japan, as a prime example, has
an advanced nuclear industry and manages a large plutonium
stockpile from its civilian nuclear fuel cycle. However, Japan issued
its "three non-nuclear principles" in 1967 and strongly
pursues disarmament initiatives as the only country to have suffered
wartime nuclear attacks. 

By contrast, Iran represents an intentional sprint to latency that other
states may be interested in emulating. Since the 2018 U.S. unilateral
withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which negotiated
restrictions on both the uranium enrichment (to acquire fissile U-235)
and plutonium reprocessing routes to weapons-grade material, Iran
has exceeded the treaty's limits on installed centrifuges and the
stockpiling of enriched uranium. A 2024 ODNI report warned that Iran has
accumulated both the "infrastructure and experience" to quickly acquire
weapons-grade (90+ %) uranium by further enriching its growing
stockpile of high-enriched (60 %) uranium. While the decision to acquire
a weapon is ultimately political, statements from Iranian leaders
suggest that the regime believes achieving a nuclear threshold
status has granted Iran the benefits of nuclear deterrence by
engendering greater caution from adversaries and guaranteeing regime
survival without incurring the costs of weaponization. Recent shocks to
Iran's proxy-based regional deterrence may further encourage Tehran to
use the threat of weaponization as coercive leverage. Iran's nuclear
latency also underscores the deterioration of the global
nonproliferation regime and may directly "catalyze" other potential
proliferators. 

Messaging from Saudi Arabia and South Korea, key U.S security allies,
has made clear that curtailing even the nuclear ambitions of U.S
partners will become increasingly difficult. Saudi Arabia, which
has repeatedly threatened to acquire a nuclear weapon if Iran does,
seeks an ambitious civil nuclear program that includes enrichment and
processing facilities. The rationale for the Saudi civil nuclear program
is compelling: the Kingdom must diversify its heavily fossil-fuel
reliant energy sector and requires the electrical capacity required for
large scale desalination to alleviate growing water scarcity concerns.
However, Saudi Arabia has rejected a "gold standard" civil nuclear
agreement that requires a binding commitment to forswear an indigenous
nuclear fuel cycle, which has long been regarded in Washington as an
unacceptable proliferation risk. 

In South Korea, which faces a growing North Korean nuclear threat that
has reduced the credibility of the U.S nuclear umbrella
despite stronger U.S. security assurances, 71% of the public supports
the acquisition of a national nuclear arsenal. South Korean political
and military leaders have been normalizing the idea of an independent
nuclear arsenal. South Korea can pursue a nuclear latency by developing
domestic enrichment or reprocessing infrastructure. Such a move would
likely imperil its bilateral nuclear cooperation agreement with the
United States and cripple its import-dependent civil nuclear industry in
the process. Having experienced waves of deadly weather events, South
Koreans now view climate change as a threat equal to that of the North
Korean nuclear program and has relied on a pivot to nuclear energy to
reduce fossil fuel use. A South Korean bomb would trade one existential
risk while jeopardizing the country's efforts to combat the other.

The Geostrategic Competition Angle

The challenge of safely exporting nuclear energy is heightened by
Russian and PRC  advantages in the nuclear export market and the
privileging of strategic competition over nonproliferation goals. Russia
and the PRC have full nuclear fuel cycles operated by state-backed
companies, which have a decided cost advantage and have contributed
a combined 87 % of new installed nuclear reactors globally. The United
States also does not have any domestic, commercial-scale HALEU
providers---the only source of commercial HALEU in the global market is
the Russian firm Tenex. Given that Moscow has shown blatant
disregard for nuclear safety by repeatedly attacking and occupying
nuclear power stations in its illegal invasion of Ukraine, not to
mention its history of nuclear accidents, Russian dominance of the SMR
fuel market would be detrimental to global nuclear security. The United
States is also not without blame for weakening the nonproliferation
system. Strategic competition has led Washington to create double
standards. The Bush administration carved out an exception in
international nonproliferation efforts to pursue a civil nuclear deal
with India in 2008, and the Biden administration exploited a loophole in
IAEA safeguards to establish Phase One of AUKUS: equipping Australia
with a nuclear-powered submarine fleet.

Nonetheless, Russian and PRC nuclear exports pose major proliferation
concerns: both countries have weaker supply-side export restrictions
than the United States and other Western democracies and have repeatedly
failed to enforce trade control regimes. Russia has "drastically
reduced" its commitment to nonproliferation norms, having blocked
consensus at the 2022 NPT Review Conference and accelerated its
diplomatic and military cooperation with Iran and North Korea. The PRC's
nuclear energy cooperation with Pakistan is likewise inconsistent with
its nonproliferation commitments, and despite curtailing its nuclear and
missile exports (which involved directly aiding Pakistan's nuclear
weapons program), Chinese firms still supply sensitive technology and
equipment to North Korea, Iran, and Pakistan. 

Given the stakes, the United States and its like-minded partners must be
proactive in addressing the intersections between climate change and
nuclear security. With nuclear energy likely to see a resurgence as a
decarbonization tool in the coming decades, Washington cannot afford to
further recede from the global nuclear market, thereby opening the door
for competitors to dominate. Washington must also factor climate risks
into increasingly complex regional nuclear dynamics while strengthening
the resilience of its civil and military nuclear infrastructure.
Finally, recognizing that countries have holistic aims for their
national nuclear programs, of which latency or weaponization represents
only a part, the United States must engage with allies and partners'
energy ambitions while acting as a responsible, consistent force in
nonproliferation to tackle the root causes of their security concerns.

### Warming Turns Econ\-\--2AC

#### Climate change [destroys]{.underline} the economy

**Gelles 25** \[David Gelles, reporter on the New York Times climate
team, leads The Times's Climate Forward newsletter and events series,
4-10-2025, \"Climate Change Could Become a Global Economic Disaster\",
New York Times,
https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/climate/climate-change-economic-effects.html

As stocks gyrate in response to President Trump's on-again, off-again
tariffs, the world is understandably focused on the immediate chaos
affecting the global economy.

Yet [over the past few months a number of [signals]{.mark} have [pointed
to a far more profound disruption]{.mark} on the horizon]{.underline}:
**[[the growing economic cost of climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

In a recent report about the rising demand for air-conditioning, Morgan
Stanley casually observed that the planet was all but certain to blow
past the goal of limiting the global average temperature rise to no more
than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, a threshold laid out
in the Paris Agreement.

The company's "base case," the report said, was that the world was
moving toward a temperature increase of 3 degrees Celsius.

That forecast, once thought of as extreme, is now becoming commonplace.
The United Nations' Emissions Gap report for 2024 said that [the
[world]{.mark} was likely to [warm 3.1]{.mark} degrees Celsius over the
course of this century without efforts to **rapidly** reduce
emissions.]{.underline} The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change has forecast that [**[without drastic action]{.mark}**
temperatures will be even higher than that by the end of the
century.]{.underline}

A constant challenge when talking about global warming is appreciating
that little numbers --- [a [rise in temperatures]{.mark} by just a
single degree]{.underline}, for example --- [[represent **utterly
profound changes**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Which is why it's worth pausing to consider what scientists have said
about what the world would look like if average global temperatures rose
3 degrees Celsius, and what it will cost.

A planet transformed

[At 3ºC of warming, [rising seas]{.mark} are likely to [inundate many
coastal cities]{.mark}]{.underline}, including metropolises like **[Rio
de Janeiro]{.underline}**, **[Shanghai]{.underline}**,
**[Miami]{.underline}** and **[Osaka]{.underline}**, Japan.

A litany of other problems, including [[extreme
weather]{.underline}]{.mark}, [unrelenting [heat
waves]{.mark}]{.underline}, [the [proliferation of]{.mark} insect-borne
[diseases]{.mark}]{.underline}, [widespread species
[extinction]{.mark} and declines in crop yields]{.underline}, would also
get worse.

**[It's [impossible to know]{.mark} the [actual cost]{.mark} of all
these disruptions]{.underline}**. Yet as the prospect of more intense
warming becomes more likely, [some estimates are beginning to
emerge]{.underline}.

By 2049, [costs from the effects of climate change could [total more
than **\$38 trillion annually**,]{.mark}]{.underline}[ **[according
to]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[a paper by
[scholars]{.mark} ]{.underline}**at the Potsdam Institute for Climate
Impact Research.

In the United States alone, [climate change is expected to [wipe away
\$1.47 trillion in value from real estate]{.mark}]{.underline} around
the country by 2055, according to a February report from First Street,
which models climate risk.

Just in New York City, [more than [80,000 homes]{.mark} could be [lost
to floods]{.mark} in the next 15 years]{.underline}, my colleagues Mihir
Zaveri and Hilary Howard reported this week.

Beyond the immediate losses inflicted by severe weather and flooding, [a
[decline in output]{.mark} is likely [as crops fail]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
extreme [heat strains supply chain]{.mark}s.]{.underline}

Researchers at ETH Zurich recently calculated that in a world that has
warmed 3ºC, [[global g]{.mark}ross [d]{.mark}omestic [p]{.mark}roduct is
likely to [fall by]{.mark} an average of [10 percent]{.mark}, with
poorer countries hardest hit]{.underline}.

'Systemic risk'

In a recent post on LinkedIn, Günther Thallinger, a member of the board
of Allianz SE, the German insurer, offered a stark warning about what
these costs could mean for the financial system.

**[[Climate change]{.mark} is simply [making]{.mark} some [things
uninsurable]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

"The math breaks down: the premiums required exceed what people or
companies can pay," he said. "This is already happening. [**[Entire
regions]{.mark}** are becoming uninsurable]{.underline}."

But the risks extend well beyond the insurance business, Thallinger
said.

"This is not a one-off market adjustment," he wrote in his post. "This
is a [systemic risk that [threatens the very foundation of the financial
sector]{.mark}]{.underline}. If insurance is no longer available, other
financial services become unavailable too. A house that cannot be
insured cannot be mortgaged. No bank will issue loans for uninsurable
property. Credit markets freeze. [This is a climate-induced credit
crunch]{.underline}."

At that point, Thallinger wrote, "**[the financial sector as we know it
[ceases to function]{.mark}]{.underline}**."

[[Climate change]{.mark} is [affecting prospects for trade and]{.mark}
economic [development]{.mark} **[around the]{.mark}
[world]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Extreme weather can [[disrupt supply
chains]{.mark}, [damage]{.mark} the [transport infrastructure]{.mark}
necessary for trade in goods, [and]{.mark} [restrict]{.mark} people's
[ability to travel]{.mark}]{.underline}. Changing climatic conditions
and the policies introduced to address them are shifting the patterns of
comparative advantage, [[creating risks for countries]{.mark} that rely
on climate-vulnerable sectors]{.underline} but also new economic
opportunities for countries with plentiful renewable energy sources such
as wind, sunlight and minerals critical to the manufacture of clean
infrastructure.

How does climate change disrupt trade?

The [[rising frequency and intensity]{.mark} and widening geographical
spread of extreme and [sudden weather events due to climate
change]{.mark}]{.underline}, along with '[slow-onset' impacts including
sea level rise, [pose **serious risks**]{.mark} to the transport
infrastructure]{.underline} necessary for the smooth and reliable
operation of international trade routes. For example, hurricanes and
floods can directly damage roads, bridges, ports and railway tracks and
disrupt air transport. Policymakers' awareness of these physical risks
to trade have been heightened by recent crises such as COVID-19 and the
war in Ukraine, as these have highlighted the [**[vulnerability of
transport]{.mark} [infrastructure]{.mark}** and international supply
chains [to risks emanating from outside]{.mark} the [economic]{.mark}
and financial [system]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Maritime transport is **particularly exposed** to climate-related
risks]{.underline}. Sea level rise represents a direct threat to the
operation of ports, while [[changes in precipitation affect]{.mark} the
viability of [critical shipping hubs and passages]{.mark}]{.underline}.
For example, [the [Panama Canal]{.mark}]{.underline} -- which handles
around 6% of global maritime commerce﻿ -- dir[ectly [depends on
the]{.mark} availability of [freshwater]{.mark} for its operation [and
is]{.mark} therefore [**highly vulnerable** to changes in
precipitation]{.mark} patterns [and]{.mark}
[drought]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Canal authority has had to impose
restrictions on the﻿ largest ships passing through because of falling
water levels in nearby lakes. Low rainfall and heat-related
evaporation have caused﻿ similar shipping disruptions in China's Yangtze
river. Both small island states and landlocked countries and regions are
particularly vulnerable to this type of disruption given their reliance
on a limited number of trade routes.

The [[complex]{.mark} and interconnected [nature of global]{.mark} value
[chains﻿]{.mark} that shape today's international trade system also
[mean]{.mark}s [that disruption]{.mark} in key locations [can have
an]{.mark} [exaggerated effect for the glob]{.mark}al
economy]{.underline}. This is particularly problematic when disasters
hit regions that produce hard-to-replace, highly-specialised goods (for
example, [the production of electronics parts was disrupted during the
Thailand floods﻿ of 2011]{.underline}).

Today, [a [billion-dollar extreme weather event occurs **every three
week**]{.mark}**s**]{.underline}. [Four decades ago, **one occurred
every four months**.]{.underline}1 [These extreme weather events can
take many forms, from floods to hurricanes to droughts. Yet, a
consistent factor for all is that **[each makes global supply chains
less reliable.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[[Drought]{.mark} has [lowered]{.mark} the [water level]{.mark}s
[of]{.mark} several [key waterways]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2023,
including the Mississippi, Rhine and Yangtze. Perhaps most notably, it
also reduced the water levels in the Panama Canal, [which handles about
5% of world trade by volume each year,2 [causing a reduction in]{.mark}
the [transit]{.mark} of goods.]{.underline} [Conversely, [major
flooding]{.mark} in Slovenia [impact]{.mark}ed [manufacturing
facilities]{.mark}, which led to [disruptions in European supply
chains]{.mark}]{.underline}.3 [Meanwhile, major flooding in India's
Chennai region forced many manufacturing plants to close]{.underline}.4

[Disruptions caused by extreme weather events **are set to remain a [key
risk in 2024]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [More disruptions mean **[longer
delivery times]{.mark}**, **[higher costs and lower output]{.mark}**.
The [economic risks]{.mark} of climate change to global trade are
**[predicted]{.mark} to sit [around]{.mark} US\$81bn**.]{.underline}
[This rises to **[at least US\$122bn]{.mark}** when factoring in
economic activity linked to industry output and consumption.5 Such
losses are **[higher than the individual GDP of Slovakia, Ecuador or
Kenya.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[Disruptions caused by [climate change impact all parts of]{.mark} the
[supply chain]{.mark}]{.underline}

[More than 99% of surveyed executives stated their supply chain is
impacted by climate change]{.underline}. [Predominantly,
[disruptions]{.mark} are [felt in delivery as]{.mark} both downstream
and upstream [transportation is impacted]{.mark}]{.underline}. For
instance, [Hurricane Ian]{.underline}, which struck the Caribbean and
the US in September 2022, [resulted in a [75% drop in shipments]{.mark}
and saw an [increase in]{.mark} shipping [time]{.mark} by 2.5
days]{.underline}.6 [[Weather]{.mark} is also the [cause of 23%
of]{.mark} all road [delays]{.mark} in the US and costs trucking
companies anually between US\$2bn and \$3.5bn.7 This is due to
disruptions to work shifts, in-transit holding costs, late fees and
customer retention, among others]{.underline}.

The effects move beyond transport to the availability of raw materials,
reduced production levels, storage of goods and even consumer
preferences. The most obvious is extreme weather\'s impact on
agriculture. One study, focusing on the German economy, found that
drought caused damages to winter wheat that exceeded €23mn annually from
1995-2019.8 [The costs to supply chains as a result of extreme weather
are so severe that businesses need to make it a higher priority in their
supply-chain strategy.]{.underline}

Companies need to pay more attention to the impacts of extreme weather
on supply chains

Less than a fifth of executives ranked global warming and extreme
weather patterns as a key reason for pessimism for global trade for 2024
and 2025, losing out to other key factors such as inflation and
geopolitics.

Executive action does not paint a better picture. 'Reduced carbon
footprint' was the main outcome to companies\' supply-chain
restructuring over the last 12 months for only 14.8% of surveyed
companies.

[[Higher]{.mark} carbon [emissions]{.mark} are [linked to extreme
weather events]{.mark}.9 And, supply chains have been estimated to
generate about 60% of carbon emissions globally.]{.underline}10 So
reducing the carbon footprint of supply chains will lead to fewer
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and therefore reduce the frequency of
these events in the future. While it will take a global effort, if
businesses were to reprioritise this it would not only have a
significant impact on global emissions but would also lead to faster
delivery times, fewer supply disruptions and lower transport costs in
future years.

[Climate and nuclear costs]{.underline}

According to a report by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\[1\],
detailed in the report "From Warheads to Mills"\[2\] in that country
alone, [the [costs of damages]{.mark} caused [by extreme weather events
were \$400 billion]{.mark} in 2018, and this cost [could easily reach
\$3 trillion]{.mark} per year by 2050]{.underline}. The [cost of air
pollution from burning fossil fuels is estimated to be about \$176
billion per year, or up to \$5.2 trillion]{.underline}, in total, by
2050.

Investment in green technologies is scarce worldwide, especially in the
countries that contaminate the most. However, considering the high
direct and indirect costs of environmental damage, [it is clear that
their cost-effectiveness is high]{.underline}. However, political
short-termism and its consequent demagoguery result in the inaction on
the part of most politicians. In fact, many political resources and
scientific talent needed for ecological innovation are currently engaged
in the development of nuclear weapons and other enterprises that, far
from solving urgent existential problems, rather threaten life on the
planet.

Nuclear weapons, in particular, are militarily and politically obsolete
and suicidal. The short-sightedness of this arms whim is very costly,
since these weapons are extremely expensive to maintain: current
investment in nuclear weapons is \$126 billion per year and rising.

[The risk of nuclear war]{.underline}

The [[climate crisis increases the risk of nuclear
war]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The [Bulletin of Atomic Scientists']{.mark}
Doomsday Clock]{.underline}, a symbolic clock that [[measures]{.mark}
the [risk of]{.mark} total catastrophic [destruction by]{.mark} a
[nuclear war]{.mark}, [currently marks]{.mark} 2 minutes to midnight,
[the greatest risk since 1947]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is mainly [due
to]{.mark} three factors: 1. unstable political leadership in the
nuclear states, 2. increased risk of accidental nuclear detonation or
cyberterrorism due to the vulnerability of the high and growing reliance
on automated systems, and 3. [[climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Climate change multiplies]{.mark} the [potential for conflict over
resources such as land, drinking water and food reserves, and increases
the pressure to migrate]{.mark}]{.underline}. Political collapse, in
turn, leads to extremist leaders gaining control over nuclear weapons,
[which [poses a risk in regions where there]{.mark} already [is]{.mark}
political [tension]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[2024]{.mark} was Earth's [warmest on record]{.mark}.]{.underline} Not
only did it eclipse 2023's record high, but it [exceeded the 2015 Paris
threshold of 1.5°C above preindustrial levels for the first
time.]{.underline} The [data]{.underline} --- including proxy records
like tree rings and ice cores --- [show that 2024 was likely the hottest
of the past 125,000 years.]{.underline} Multiple [global
[records]{.mark} were [broken]{.mark} for greenhouse gas levels, air
temperature, and sea surface temperature.]{.underline}

The ugly reality is this: While individual years are not to be taken as
proof of anything, the long-term trend is toward even more rapid
warming.

The Los Angeles wildfires are not exceptional. Among the most data
recorded during 2024 was an unusually high amount of atmospheric water
vapor, about 5% above the 1991--2020 average. [[Extreme heat and high
humidity are]{.mark} a [deadly]{.mark} combination.]{.underline} [They
[shift rain and locations]{.mark} suitable [for ag]{.mark}ricultural
production and contribute to extreme precipitation events and rapidly
intensified tropical cyclones like hurricanes Helene and
Milton.]{.underline}

For reasons climate scientists don't yet fully understand, [the [rate of
change has increased faster than]{.mark} previously
[anticipated]{.mark}.]{.underline} [It is possible that [global tipping
points]{.mark}, such as the shutdown of major ocean currents, [are
closer]{.mark} than we once thought]{.underline}. According to the
Copernicus Global Climate Survey, an agency of the European Commission,
each year in the last decade has been one of the 10 hottest on record.
Data from U.S. centers, NOAA and NASA, show similar results.

[Global temperatures are rising beyond what modern humans have ever
experienced.]{.underline} 2024 didn't feature 2023's planet-warming El
Niño event on top of human-caused climate change, yet it still managed
to eclipse the previous year on the list of the hottest. [The
[oceans]{.mark} have [become a heat sink]{.mark}, reaching
never-before-seen levels.]{.underline}

In 2023, ex-NASA scientist James Hansen published a meta-analysis.
Hansen famously and accurately warned in 1988 that human-caused warming
would soon emerge from the background noise of natural variability. The
paper's authors concluded that the planet would witness more severe
extreme weather events, species losses, and sea level rise than had
previously been projected.

A new study has found that scientists may have underestimated the amount
of melting on the Greenland Ice Sheet since 1985 by as much as 20%.
[This melting is the most significant contributor to the rise of the
global sea level.]{.underline} Today's data indicates that the rate of
ice retreat stayed steady until the 1990s, with a faster loss rate since
2000. [Given the new numbers, more freshwater has entered the North
Atlantic Ocean since 1985 than previously known.]{.underline} [This
would explain some of the observed [weakening in]{.mark} the vital
Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation ([AMOC]{.mark}), which
includes the Gulf Stream]{.underline}. We don't know the 'tipping point'
that could trigger a full-scale collapse of the AMOC. However, we are
already beginning to see some of the geopolitical consequences.

Remember that the shifting currents in the atmosphere and seas also mean
greater extremes of cold and blizzard conditions. The winds and dry
season combined to create the Los Angeles wildfires are the same winds,
now with a moist atmosphere, that dumped blizzards on New Orleans,
Houston, and Tallahassee.

This is not simply a disaster for homeowners in Los Angeles and Miami.
[[Entire countries]{.mark} are [at risk]{.mark} of
disappearing.]{.underline} Military operations will have to take the new
planning into account. [The [world economy will suffer]{.mark} shifts
that will help some players but harm most of them.]{.underline}
[[Russia]{.mark} is suffering a [collapse of]{.mark}
[permafrost]{.mark}, [threatening oil]{.mark} production.]{.underline}
China is already importing most of its food to survive. [[Bangladesh may
not survive]{.mark}.]{.underline} And places like Saudi Arabia, already
inhospitable and dependent on oil as a source of revenue, are stuck in a
situation where their long-term survival depends on finding some way to
manage the transition to a low-carbon world economy while investing in
projects enabling its population to live.

Geopolitics and climate change

[Geopolitics and climate change are related in three
dimensions]{.underline}. First, [[climate change impacts the
military]{.mark}, economic, and political realities, constraining state
and nonstate action.]{.underline} Second, the choices made by states and
nonstate actors influence the future patterns of climate change. Third,
[the changing climate\'s political, economic, and military interaction
effects [will lead to emergent outcomes]{.mark} we can only guess
at.]{.underline} Together, these are too much for a single essay. Books
are being written, and I'll turn to the second and third dimensions
later. For now, I'll start with the most obvious topic: climate change
and geopolitics.

Let's start with the military. Consider the poor infantryman. In the
best of circumstances, he's digging holes and trying to stay alive while
people he doesn't know are doing their best to kill him. Now add the
effects of weather. Any Vietnam veteran will tell you stories about the
impact of fighting in jungles and mud. Any veteran of Iraq will tell you
about combat in desert conditions. He has to plan for both
simultaneously as the climate swings between extremes.

Although it has rarely been given the attention it deserves in military
history, the specific qualities of mud on the battlefield have
determined the outcome of critical battles throughout history. Napoleon
delayed his attack at Waterloo a day to allow the mud to dry. In 1942,
Russian mud stopped the German advance, which had to pause until the
ground had frozen. Evidence from the American Civil War to Ukraine shows
that all muds are not equal; they exhibit different qualities of
slipperiness and stickiness, affecting military vehicles and weapons in
unpredictable ways.

On a larger scale, [everything from monsoons to growing seasons and
agricultural regions changes as the climate shifts]{.underline}.

[Military operations will become easier for some]{.underline} and more
difficult for others. [Climate change [stands]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
profoundly [challenge the U.S. nuclear
deterrent]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Sea level rise, extreme
weather events, and warming temperatures]{.underline} can be expected to
[[have **mission-altering impacts** on deterrence]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Climate change]{.mark} challenges bases hosting U.S. nuclear weapons
overseas]{.underline}. As part of its extended deterrence policy, the
U.S. forward deploys an estimated one hundred warheads for dual-capable
aircraft (DCA) at six air bases in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the
Netherlands, and Türkiye.

[Flash flooding, wildfires, and extreme heat [threaten]{.mark} the
[infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline} and personnel supporting the DCA
mission. NATO claims to be constantly on guard against "technological
and geo-strategic evolutions," but it has been reluctant to acknowledge
the vulnerability of the alliance's nuclear assets to climate change.

A 2019 flood at Incirlik Air Base in Türkiye --- the only base in
Türkiye that hosts U.S. nuclear weapons (but not DCA )--- illustrates
how flash flooding can overload a base's drainage system. There are no
reports of the on-base vaults storing U.S. nuclear weapons being
affected. However, it is conceivable that underground facilities could
suffer damage during particularly severe floods in the future.

Even a modest increase in annual rainfall can increase the likelihood of
a flash flood. As the mean moves, the extremes are becoming more
extreme. Even a base relatively insulated from sea level rise---like
Vokel in the Netherlands---is vulnerable to flash flooding. In a
worst-case scenario, flooding would inundate the base's only runway,
requiring aircraft evacuation or forcible grounding, much like the
incident at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska in 2019. Because Volkel is
a DCA base, a flooded runway could mean that the nuclear weapons stored
there may not be deployable: even if the weapons could be loaded, the
aircraft might not be able to take off.

These [[issues are compounded]{.underline}]{.mark} if flash flooding
prevents critical personnel from accessing the base, a plausible
scenario since personnel at Volkel live off base. Two other storage
sites --- Büchel Air Force Base (Germany) and Kleine Brogel Air Force
Base (Belgium) --- face a similar problem.

[Wildfires]{.underline} can also [[undermine a base's ability to]{.mark}
perform its [mission]{.mark}]{.underline}. U.S. nuclear weapons stored
in underground vaults would likely be relatively insulated, even if
rendered inaccessible, but personnel and aircraft would need to be
evacuated. [[Operations]{.mark} would be severely
[disrupted]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Extreme temperatures are projected to be especially pronounced in
Southern Europe, impacting Italy\'s Aviano and Ghedi Air Bases. Even on
a "good" day, warmer, [less dense air makes it harder for aircraft to
generate lift]{.underline}, posing problems for takeoff and landing.
This reduces the aircraft's fuel or payload capacity, with implications
for the duration and scope of operations. These warmer temperatures also
cause additional wear and tear, such as the damage caused by overheated
engines.

Europe is but one area of operation. America is a global power, and
similar problems are found in regions worldwide.

**[[Climate change shapes borders]{.underline}]{.mark}**

On a larger scale, [climate change is already reshaping the borders of
the globe]{.underline}. [Rising seas]{.underline} are [[threatening to
remove]{.mark} the [states of the Pacific]{.mark}]{.underline} and
threaten the seacoasts of most of the planet.

Malé, the capital of the Maldives, already has coastal defenses in
place. The country, composed of nearly 1,200 small coral islands and
home to around 540,000 people, is the flattest country on Earth, with an
average elevation of just 3 feet (1 meter). Should the sea level rise by
another 18 inches (45 cm), it will lose around 77% of its land area.

Kiribati, a small island in the heart of the Pacific with a population
of nearly 120,000, could lose two-thirds of its land if sea levels rise
by three feet. Around 3 million Pacific islanders live within 6.2 miles
(10 km) of the coast, and many must relocate before the end of the
century.

We have already witnessed the disappearance of at least five "vegetated
reef islands" previously part of the Solomon Islands and "a further six
islands experiencing severe shoreline recession." Three communities in
the Solomons have been relocated so far. And recall that the rise in sea
level has been accelerating since 1994.

But it's not merely islands that are at risk. [About **fifteen percent**
of the world's population lives within 5 kilometers]{.underline} (3.1
miles) [of the sea.]{.underline}

Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, is home to around 10 million people
and has been dubbed the "fastest-sinking city in the world" by the BBC.
Between rising sea levels and "excessive groundwater drainage," it sinks
by 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) each year. According to the World Economic
Forum, much of Jakarta could be underwater by 2050. Jakarta's situation
is so dire that Indonesia is attempting to replace it as Indonesia's
capital with Nusantara, a city under construction on the east coast of
Borneo, 1,200 miles away.

Jakarta is far from the only city with an uncertain future. The World
Economic Forum reports that by the end of the century, Dhaka, Bangladesh
(population 22.4 million); Lagos, Nigeria (population 15.3 million); and
Bangkok, Thailand (population 9 million) could also be entirely drowned
or have vast tracts of land underwater and unusable.

Every country with seacoast cities (the vast majority of them) will have
to adjust. The country where the most people will be affected by sea
level change is China, with 43 million people living in precarious
coastal locations. According to the European Union-funded Life Adaptate
project, India has 27 million people in similar conditions.

America is not immune. Recent projections show that [many U.S. cities
will face serious issues]{.underline} by 2050, potentially rendering
vast swathes of land unlivable. According to NOAA, "in many locations
along the U.S. coastline, high tide flooding is now 300% to more than
900% more frequent than it was 50 years ago."

The single American city most at risk may be New York City, according to
research from Climate Central. They report that by 2050, nearly half a
million (426,000) New Yorkers will be living on "threatened land." New
York's vulnerability to flooding was seen clearly in 2012 when Hurricane
Sandy heavily impacted the city. At least 43 people in the city died as
a result of the superstorm. Around a quarter of a million vehicles were
destroyed, part of at least \$32 billion worth of "damage and loss,"
according to then-Governor Andrew Cuomo. If we look at all the counties
in New York and New Jersey that were declared disaster areas by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Commerce Department
concluded tens of billions of dollars of impact (and over 100,000
unemployed) from the storm, requiring years to repair.

As for the American state most susceptible to flooding, Florida will
surely be hit hardest. According to Climate Central's research, 36 of
the 50 U.S. cities most vulnerable to coastal flooding are in Florida.
Last year, at least fifteen people died, and hundreds were rescued in
Hurricane Milton. This is just a foretaste of things to come.

Officials do all they can, but in conditions like these, there is little
to do but pick up the pieces. Preparation is key---and so far, it hasn't
happened.

**[The [environment creates conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**

As weather patterns shift, [[new points of conflict
emerge]{.underline}]{.mark}. Interpersonal conflict increases with
temperature, with a 1-degree increase in temperature raising
interpersonal conflict by 2.4 percent and intergroup conflict by 11.3
percent. [[Water scarcity]{.mark} will increase]{.underline}.
[[Pressures for resources]{.mark} will encourage
deforestation]{.underline}, which will [lead to erosion and a loss of
land]{.underline}. The [[oceans]{.mark} will [suffer from
over-fishing]{.mark}]{.underline} even as the rising heat and dropping
oxygen levels make it more difficult to maintain stocks. Displaced
people cross borders, searching for a place to survive, forcing tough
choices on more fortunate nations.

A key factor in determining whether a city or country will disappear is
not necessarily the rise in sea level but rather the city or country's
capacity to address the problem and develop defenses. Countries that can
afford to invest in infrastructure, like the Netherlands, might avoid
many of the effects of flooding. The United States may be able to invest
in coastal protection projects in some spots and learn via trial and
error. Most developing nations don't have that luxury.

Countries that refuse to admit what is happening are no better off than
countries that can do nothing about it. In the United States, the
response to global climate change is wrapped in partisan politics.
President Trump recently abandoned the Paris Climate Accords, choosing
to "drill, baby, drill" for the carbon-rich fuels responsible for the
crisis. Expect the United States (and the world) to suffer accordingly.

Some countries may think there is a good side to a climate catastrophe.
They are wrong. For example, the Northwest Passage remained a dream for
generations before the retreat of the Arctic ice pack made it practical
in 2009. Now, it is open several months of the year.

Although Russia will lose oil production as permafrost melts, the
opening of the Northeast Passage in Russian waters a few months each
year promises to connect the relatively landlocked country to world
trade. Unfortunately, Russia cannot control the straights blocking
Atlantic and Pacific access.

If anything, the retreating ice makes controlling those access points
more critical, with obvious economic and military implications. In the
best of circumstances, assuming access to the outside world, a large
fleet of icebreakers will continue to be necessary to keep these
shipping lanes operational for the few months they are possible. Nobody
has them. The Arctic may eventually be open to navigation year-round ---
in fifty years. If the Chinese want a quick connection to Europe, they
must wait.

In addition, there are no port facilities along those lanes, and there
will not be any for the foreseeable future. Construction on melting
permafrost is a nightmare. No transportation networks exist to support
the ports, even if ports could be constructed. Any roads and trains will
face the same problems as the ports, multiplied by the thousands of
miles they must maintain.

And there is a more immediate problem, especially for Russia.
**[[Agriculture is life]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Every country is one
bad growing season away from starvation]{.underline}. In a global
system, with international transport, that can be managed. Marginal
lands can be supplemented with fertilizers. Outside production can cover
local failure. [However, as the global system falls apart, **some
countries will feel the pain first**.]{.underline} One reason Russia
invaded Ukraine was to occupy its rich farmlands, and it is selling
seized grain today. We've seen how well that's gone for them.

After innovations in plant nutrition in the 19th century, an
agricultural industry developed around synthetically created
agrochemical fertilizers. This transition transformed the global food
system, allowing for larger-scale industrial agriculture. Central to the
system is wheat.

Wheat is the world\'s staple crop. It grows anywhere, even in marginal
lands, if you dump enough fertilizer on them. [Regions]{.underline} in
the United States and Europe are already [suffering from the
environmental effects of overfertilization]{.underline}. Still, they can
maintain production on their land and have begun to reverse their
dependency. Around the world, most of this fertilizer comes from North
America. And today, three countries depend most on this imported
fertilizer to produce wheat on their marginal farmlands: Kazakhstan,
Russia, and China.

As the ice retreats, new resources will become available --- slowly.
Between the problems of access, transportation, and processing, this may
be relevant in a century, but not before. We have to get through the
transition without them. **[[Expect]{.mark}
[famine]{.mark}]{.underline}** long before these resources arrive.

[[Famine]{.mark} [makes countries **desperate**]{.mark}**,** and
[desperate countries do **stupid things**]{.mark}.]{.underline} No
country will escape the political and economic consequences.

In short, as this audience already knows, **[[climate change is
real]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [The geopolitical [effects]{.mark} are
real.]{.underline} [**They [aren't pretty]{.mark}.** They are [going to
get a lot **worse.**]{.mark}]{.underline} And they are rushing towards
us now.

5 Conclusions and Summary

[[Ferromanganese]{.mark} crusts and [nodules]{.mark} collected during
2008, 2009, and 2012 cruises [to the]{.mark} Amerasia [Arctic
Ocean]{.mark} are [characterized by]{.mark} unique mineral and chemical
compositions, [fast growth]{.mark} rates, and other characteristics
[compared to crusts]{.mark} [formed elsewhere in the global
ocean]{.mark}]{.underline}. These characteristics reflect temporal and
spatial variations in geological, oceanographic, and climatic conditions
in the Arctic Ocean and surrounding continents over the past ∼15 Myr.

Initiation of Arctic Fe-Mn crust growth was ∼15 Myr ago. The start of
crust growth in the Amerasia Arctic is attributed to establishment of
modern-type circulation starting with the deepening of Fram Strait in
the North Atlantic Ocean, which occurred ∼17.5 to 16.0 Myr ago. The most
significant event for initiation of crust growth was ventilation of the
deep basins of the Amerasia Arctic, which accompanied with middle
Miocene cooling and tectonic stability, established the conditions
necessary for the widespread growth of the Fe-Mn crusts. These data
indicate that by circa 15 Myr ago, the Amerasia Arctic Ocean basins were
ventilated to depths below the Arctic Intermediate Water. Neogene
environmental changes determined the sources and mechanisms of
transportation of dissolved and particulate phases that affected the
composition and growth of crusts. While these regional and Arctic
Ocean-wide temporal changes influenced the composition and growth of
crusts, the history of each crust was complicated by local geological
and oceanographic conditions.

The exceptionally fast growth rates for Arctic Fe-Mn crusts vary from
1.1 to 42.1 mm/Myr for all samples. High growth rates (\>10 mm/Myr) are
usually considered to reflect hydrothermal input. However, the high Fe
contents relative to Mn, and the large detrital component combined to
significantly increase growth rates compared to crusts formed elsewhere
in the global ocean. Therefore, thick Arctic Ocean hydrogenetic crusts
can form over much shorter time periods than those found elsewhere in
the global ocean. Based on data presented here and Conrad et al.
([2017](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GC007186#ggge21412-bib-0023)),
the range of growth rates for hydrogenetic crusts seems to be increasing
as new environments are being studied.

The high detrital mineral content consists predominantly of quartz,
feldspar, pyroxene, amphibole, magnetite, dolomite, and clay minerals
along with many trace minerals, such as detrital high Cu-, Zn-, Pb-,
Ni-, Zr-, Cr-minerals; these metal-rich minerals may have been derived
from weathering of ancient mineral deposits. Many of the detrital
minerals are typical of mafic and especially ultramafic rocks, like
those recovered from the Chukchi Platform, and Mendeleev and Alpha
Ridges. Erosion of local outcrops from these three areas is likely the
main source of detritus for the crusts, along with contributions from
North America and Siberia, which are transported via rivers and glaciers
and dispersed via sea ice, brine plumes, and current systems.

Discrimination diagrams show that the crusts and nodules are
hydrogenetic. However, the oxide mineralogy is atypical for hydrogenetic
Fe-Mn crusts and nodules, which typically include only amorphous Fe
oxyhydroxide and δ-MnO2 (vernadite). In contrast, the Arctic samples
also include the Mn oxides birnessite, 10 Å manganates (predominantly
todorokite), and rarely ramsdellite, and the Fe minerals also include
goethite, lepidocrocite, feroxyhyte, and ferrihydrite. These differences
reflect formation under lower oxygen conditions for the Arctic crusts
compared to those found elsewhere, and are most similar to crusts formed
in continental-margin environments.

[The [unique difference]{.mark} in chemical composition between Arctic
crusts and those formed elsewhere [is the high Fe contents]{.mark}
relative to Mn, which determines the trace elements hosted by Fe-Mn
oxide phases and their concentrations.]{.underline} The high Fe/Mn
ratios reflect the expansive continental shelves and upper slopes that
support redox cycling that releases Fe to bottom waters, and to the
large fluvial input from North America and Siberia. Brine formation on
the shelves promotes the distribution of the Fe throughout the Amerasia
Arctic Ocean including the deep basins. The very low Mn contents in
Arctic crusts reflect the OMZ in the Arctic study area, which is very
narrow and shallow, 100--300 m
(BCO-DMO, [2017](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GC007186#ggge21412-bib-0008);
Kondo et
al., [2016](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GC007186#ggge21412-bib-0073)).
In other areas where crusts form, the OMZ is broader, deeper, and more
depleted in DO, especially along continental margins. This is important
because the OMZ provides a reservoir for the storage of high
concentrations of dMn. Mn contents in Arctic crusts are further
decreased by dilution from high detritus contents, low contents of Mn in
that detritus, and the propensity for Fe oxyhydroxides to nucleate
around detritus.

[[Uniquely high contents of Sc in Arctic crusts]{.mark} and nodules [set
them]{.mark} apart [from]{.mark} Fe-Mn [deposits formed elsewhere in
the]{.mark} global [ocean]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Sc content decreased
in the crusts with time. Sc was sorbed on the Fe oxyhydroxide matrix and
is also part of the Al-rich component of the detrital fraction. dSc and
pSc seawater profiles in Amerasia Arctic Ocean show the highest
concentrations at the sites closest to Mackenzie River and continental
shelf and Sc maxima are related to the halocline and other shelf
processes including production of brine plumes. Spikes in dSc and pSc
concentrations within the BNL attest to their availability for sorption
onto the Fe phases and acquisition as detrital minerals.

[Arctic Ocean crusts and nodules [also have high contents of As, V, Li,
Hg, and Th compared to]{.mark} crusts from the [other
oceans]{.mark}]{.underline}. The high As, V, and Th contents reflect the
higher Fe relative to Mn contents for Arctic crusts and nodules. As, V,
and Th sorb predominantly onto the Fe oxyhydroxide minerals. Li is
likely a component of many crust and nodule phases, but the most
significant associations are with the Al-rich detrital phases, with a
small component of the Li associated with the residual biogenic and Fe
phases. The key difference of Hg in the crusts is its high content and
variability compared to the other elements with unusually high contents.
Hg in the Arctic Fe-Mn deposits is hosted by the Fe and Mn matrix phases
in addition to the detrital and biogenic phases. The source of the Hg is
likely nearby geothermal hydrothermal systems that release Hg and other
trace metals to the seafloor, and also detrital organic-carbon rich
terrestrial sediments.

Based on temporal changes recorded in the crusts, the elements occur in
three groups: (1) progressively higher concentrations with time (Mn, Ni,
Co, Ca, Bi, Pb, Se, Te, Th, Tl, La, Pr, Nd, Sm); (2) progressively lower
concentrations with time (Al, K, Cs, Ga, Li, and Sc); (3) and variable
with time. The changes indicate that the Arctic crusts are becoming more
like crusts from elsewhere in the global ocean as the Fe/Mn ratio and
detritus decrease.

[I]{.smallcaps}n its 2024 [Economic
Report](https://arcticeconomiccouncil.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/aec-arctic-mining-report-2024-sample.pdf),
the Arctic Economic Council ([[AEC]{.underline}]{.mark})
[[highlighted]{.mark} the]{.underline} potentially [[pivotal]{.mark}
[role mining in Arctic]{.mark} nations [could play]{.mark}]{.underline}
in [[fueling the world's]{.mark} increasing [demand
for]{.mark}]{.underline} critical raw [[materials]{.underline}]{.mark}.
 

It stated that the [[Arctic]{.mark} region]{.underline}, which
encompasses parts of eight separate countries, is [[home to 31 of the 34
materials]{.mark} identified as [essential for clean energy]{.mark}
[tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}. 

Of note within these are rare earth elements (REEs), materials necessary
for a range of clean energy technologies including electric vehicles
(EVs), batteries and wind turbines. REEs in particular are being eyed up
in Norway, Sweden and Greenland. 

Mining is not new to the Arctic region. Alaska is home to the largest
zinc mine in the world and Sweden to the largest iron ore mine in
Europe. However, high wages and strict regulatory frameworks have been
something of a deterrent to mining companies' activity in the region as
they typically want to extract as much as possible with minimal
overheads. 

Short daylight hours and extreme cold have also proven to be a hurdle to
investors looking to build infrastructure in the Arctic, as well as
companies that must provide high wages to attract any kind of workforce.
The result is that the region's mineral potential has remained
relatively untapped despite its resources -- something the AEC, among
others, is looking to change. 

With [[projections]{.mark} that [critical minerals needs]{.mark},
[including]{.mark} those for [REEs,]{.mark} are [set to rise
exponentially]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[coupled with]{.mark} mounting
[fears of an overreliance on rare earth superpower
China]{.mark}]{.underline}, a renewed spotlight is being put on the
Arctic as a potential mining hotspot.

**The minerals appeal of the Arctic**

"The Arctic region has three things that have always (and will always)
be exported," says Mads Qvist Frederiksen, executive director at AEC.
"Fish, energy and raw materials --- with the latter going back to the
1600s. 

"Fast forward, and with the rise of industrialisation the world needs
more and more minerals as it needs more technologies, meaning the
Arctic\'s raw materials are getting renewed attention." 

Indeed, according to the International Energy Agency, [demand for
critical
minerals](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-critical-minerals-outlook-2024/executive-summary) will
nearly triple by 2030, growing to more than 3.5-times the current levels
by 2050. This, alongside the fact that the Arctic is feeling the effects
of climate change more keenly than anywhere else -- warming [four-times
faster](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00498-3) than the
rest of the world, according to research in Nature -- has given some
urgency to the Arctic focus.

Currently, no REEs are mined in Europe, although the landscape is
shifting, and exploration of the Arctic has already proven it is home to
significant deposits of the materials. 

[According to the [Arctic
Review](https://www.arctic.review/economy/minerals-and-mining/#Nordic%20countries),
[Greenland has enough reserves of minerals]{.mark} such as neodymium and
dysprosium]{.underline} to meet at least a quarter of future global
demand, around 38.5 million tonnes (mt). 

Additionally, in 2023, Swedish miner LKAB made headlines by announcing
it had [identified a REE deposit in
Kiruna](https://www.mining-technology.com/news/european-rare-earths-sweden/) that
exceeds 1mt of rare earth oxides. The discovery was, briefly, the
largest deposit of its kind in Europe, before being overtaken in 2024 by
Norway's Fen Carbonatite Complex in Telemark. 

While LKAB is still conducting research into the Kiruna deposit, the
discovery adds to the perception of the Nordic Arctic as a viable supply
alternative to China -- evidenced by Donald [Trump's renewed mission to
gain control of Greenland's
minerals](https://www.mining-technology.com/features/greenlands-promise-is-it-the-mineral-haven-trump-believes/).

The Arctic's cold climate, vulnerable environment, long distances,
sparse population and lack of infrastructure result in specific
challenges and risk, as well as high costs of exploration and
activities; but the [[Arctic regions have certain advantages as
suppliers compared to other parts of the world]{.underline}]{.mark} in
terms of [[minerals conflicts, regulation, human capital,
business]{.mark} environment [and environment]{.mark}al
performance]{.underline}, although these differ across the North. Many
Arctic regions have a [centuries-long [history of exploration and
extraction]{.mark}]{.underline} of minerals, resulting in [extensive
[regulatory frameworks]{.mark}]{.underline}, developed [[extractive
service]{.mark}s sectors, good [knowledge and human

[[Environment]{.mark}al and [social standards]{.mark} and

compared to developing countries. However, Arctic countries and regions
vary in their performance. The environmental performance of the Russian
mineral industry is of concern in this context (Levchenko et al. 2019).
Some parts of the Arctic, like Greenland and parts of Arctic Canada,
remain resource frontiers characterised e.g. by limited administrative
capacities and availability of human resources.

[The [urgent transition]{.mark} away [from fossil fuels is driving
a]{.mark} **very large, transitional [demand]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} base
[metals]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is critical that we source these large
amounts of base metals with the lowest environmental, social, and
economic impacts possible. [In [this paper]{.mark}, we [focused on
**four specific**]{.mark} base metals required for the electrification
of the global passenger fleet and compared the [impacts]{.mark} of two
sources [of]{.mark} these metals[: **conventional ores on land**]{.mark}
**[and]{.mark} polymetallic nodules on the [seabed]{.mark}** in the
CCZ.]{.underline} While the focus of this paper was EV batteries, the
availability of these metals is important for a plethora of other uses,
including other renewable technologies, all of which face significant
benefits if metals may be supplied from less-impactful sources.

By comparing the cradle-to-gate impacts of producing metals from these
two different sources in depth, this paper focused on the question: How
does conventional and green mining of land-based deposits compare to
proposed projects to collect seafloor nodules as a source of supply for
the anticipated expansion in metal demand? [We [examined **all major
categories of impacts**]{.mark}: [climate change]{.mark} (including
global warming potential and carbon sequestration), nonliving resources,
[biodiversity]{.mark}, social, [and economic
impacts]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Our [analysis suggests that **producing
metals from seafloor**]{.mark} **polymetallic nodules could [have
significant advantages over land]{.mark} ores** across nearly every
impact category,]{.underline} with an important caveat: further
environmental-impact-assessment work is required to baseline and
evaluate the impact of nodule collection on seabed wildlife and
ecosystem function.

[Sourcing this large transitional base metal demand from [land
resources]{.mark}---by developing new land mines and ramping up
production of existing ones---[would risk]{.mark} further [wildlife
extinctions]{.mark} in some of the most biodiverse places on this
planet, [place a]{.mark}n additional gigatonne-sized [burden on
the]{.mark} world's [carbon budget]{.mark}, and [put a substantial
amount of stored carbon at risk]{.mark}---all at a time when we are
struggling to reverse the relentless upward trend in the world's
emissions.]{.underline} [This **significant increase** in land mining
would need to be offset by a gigatonne-scale carbon capture and storage
solution, or we risk greater rises in temperature and other climate
change impacts. More land-based mining will also mean more **[disruption
of forest habitat]{.mark}s**; more **[long-term]{.mark} local land
disruption and [pollution]{.mark}**; **[social displacement]{.mark};**
more **[carbon sequestration impacts]{.mark}**; more **[freshwater
usage]{.mark}**, more **[groundwater pollution]{.mark}**; more **[human
death]{.mark} and decades-long human-health impacts**.]{.underline} Some
of these negative consequences could be mitigated by aggressively
stepping up investment in energy and water efficiency, electrification
of mining equipment, mechanization and automation, increasing efforts to
prospect high-grade ores, and investing in revolutionizing current
production methods. All of these strategies need to be pursued.

However, it is difficult to see how these strategies could match all the
potential advantages resulting from sourcing metals from ocean nodules.
[**The [land mining sector is fundamentally challenged]{.mark}**---ore
grades are falling, production is moving to more biodiverse places,
accessing ore bodies requires either breaking or tunneling through
significant tonnage of waste rock, and toxic levels of heavy elements
often found in land ore bodies still need to be removed, stored, and
maintained indefinitely.]{.underline} Arguably, the main advantage of
using land-based sources to meet the transitional demand in base metals
is that it would avoid the need to disturb a large area of sparsely
populated and insufficiently understood seabed in the CCZ by disturbing
over three times smaller area of land--- albeit that smaller land area
carries much higher total biomass, biodiversity, and carbon storage
capacity.

climate goals. [[Recycling and conservation]{.mark} of metals [won't
make a dent in this.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Enter mining the seafloor for manganese nodules.

[Geologists have long known that the **[ocean floor is chock full of
metals]{.mark}**]{.underline} [-- Cu, Ni, Ag, Au, Pt and even
diamonds]{.underline}. Manganese nodules are polymetallic rock
concretions that lie loosely on the sea floor or buried shallowly in the
sediment (see figure above).

[These [nodules occur in most oceans]{.mark}, even in some lakes, and
are abundant on the abyssal plains of the deep ocean between 4,000 and
6,000 meters (13,000 and 20,000 ft). The nodules [can be harvested from
the sea floor bottom easily.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The Clarion-Clipperton Zone is the largest of the most economic zones,
about the size of Europe, extending from the west coast of Mexico to
Hawaii. The total mass of manganese nodules there is over 21 billion
tons. Other important areas include the Peru Basin, the Penrhyn Basin
near the Cook Islands, and the central Indian Ocean.

These areas are overseen by the United Nations International Seabed
Authority (ISA).

[[Unlike]{.mark} metal [ores on land which rarely have metal yields
above 20%,]{.mark} [and]{.mark} are often [less than 2%,]{.mark} these
**[seabed nodules are 99% usable]{.mark}**]{.underline} [minerals --
[33% metal and the rest useful in products like]{.mark} construction
[aggregate and fertilizer since there are no toxic]{.mark} levels of
[heavy elements]{.mark} like mercury or arsenic.]{.underline}

[So there's [no toxic tailings or mining waste like on land]{.mark}, no
[deforestation]{.mark}, no [open pits]{.mark}, no [contaminated rivers
or aquifers]{.mark}, and no [tailings impoundments]{.mark}]{.underline}

Seabed mining [[doesn't use child labor]{.underline}]{.mark} like much
of the land mining does. And it has a **[[life-cycle carbon footprint

#### Congress in support

\- This card also says that deep-sea mining isn't even going on
currently, thus proving the oppositions are uneducated and don't know
what they're talking about.

Street Journal, graduate of Cardiff University. "Congress to Fund U.S.
Deep-Sea Mining Project," The Wall Street Journal,
https://www.wsj.com/articles/congress-to-fund-u-s-deep-sea-mining-project-8c930869?reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink.

**[Con[gress]{.underline}]{.mark} [is set [to]{.mark} [fund]{.mark} a
[project]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}[aimed at
[kick-starting]{.mark} the [U.S. deep-sea mining
industry]{.mark}]{.underline}, as part of a broader push to secure
non-Chinese sources of critical metals that are vital for
energy-transition technologies and defense applications.

The House Armed Services Committee has instructed the
[**[Pentagon]{.mark} [to commit]{.mark}** **[\$2 million]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} a feasibility [study]{.mark}** that will partner with "an
entity experienced in refining critical minerals and producing
battery-grade" metals]{.underline}, according to draft documents seen by
The Wall Street Journal.

In doing so, [the Department of Defense will explore whether it is
possible to refine deep-sea minerals in the U.S.]{.underline} This
process, however, will only begin once the annual defense budget is
signed into law later this year.

The [move is being seen as a win for the deep-sea mining
industry,]{.underline} which to date has been dominated by relatively
small companies and Pacific island nations looking to access resources
from the bottom of the sea, with [the [U.S. government]{.mark} now
looking to [take]{.mark} a more [proactive approach]{.mark}]{.underline}
to deep-sea mining.

Still, a number of hurdles remain, with the amendments needing to be
voted on by the House and Senate before being signed into law by the
president, and likely any funds committed to the industry won't be seen
until 2025.

Deep-sea mining involves the harvesting of small rocks---or
nodules---lying on the ocean floor, often far below the surface, and
processing them for their minerals, which include metals such as cobalt,
manganese and nickel. It is considered controversial, even within the
mining sector.

Its proponents argue that by collecting minerals from the seabed, it
avoids damage being done to land-based sources of minerals. In
Indonesia, for example, nickel mining has led to deforestation. That
said, critics including large global charities such as Greenpeace and
the World Wide Fund for Nature, say that deep-sea mining will cause
irreparable harm to an environment that has been largely untouched by
humans.

The Pentagon has also been commissioned by Congress to provide a road
map of how the U.S. could source and possibly process critical minerals,
largely as a result of China actively ramping up its interest in the
burgeoning field.

Defense applications for minerals sourced from the deep sea include
technology within missiles, aerospace parts, magnets and radar.

[[U.S. Congress members]{.mark}, largely Republicans, have
[**increasingly voiced support** for d]{.mark}eep-[s]{.mark}ea
[m]{.mark}ining, seeing it as a [way to counter China's
dominance]{.mark}]{.underline} of critical mineral processing with
growing concerns in Washington over the Asian superpower's hold over
refining and production of key technologies, such as batteries.

In March, **[Reps]{.mark}**. Carol Miller (R., W.Va.) and John Joyce
(R., Pa[.) [introduced]{.mark} a [bill]{.mark} [to Congress]{.mark}
**[pushing for]{.mark} the [development and financing]{.mark} of
deep-sea mining in the U.S**.]{.underline}, while [30]{.mark} Republican
[**[members of Congress]{.mark}** had [written a letter]{.mark} last
year [to]{.mark} the U.S. [Secretary of Defense]{.mark} Lloyd Austin
[pushing for]{.mark} American [support]{.mark} for the
sector.]{.underline}

More broadly, members of the International Seabed Authority, a United
Nations observer organization, are due to meet in Kingston, Jamaica, in
July to hash out the final parts of a mining code that would establish
the parameters of how deep-sea mining could be carried out in
international waters legally. If the mining code is completed this
summer, it would set the precedent and legal basis for the industry.
Currently, the U.S. isn't a member of the ISA, but does attend the
meetings, as an observer.

In March this year, a [[number]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[distinguished]{.mark} former **[military and political

The Arctic and the South China Sea

[America\'s relationship with UNCLOS is affecting two key issues in the
[**Arctic Ocean and the South China Sea**.]{.mark}]{.underline} The
Arctic is strategically significant for several reasons. First, [[the
United States]{.mark} [has]{.mark} several refueling bases and missile
stations located in the Arctic circle, impacting national security;
second, [Russia]{.mark} [has claimed territory]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [the

**Groves 12** \[12/4/12, Steven Groves is a Director, Policy Campaigns
and Margaret Thatcher Fellow, "The U.S. Can Mine the Deep Seabed Without
Joining the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea", The Heritage
Foundation,

HongruiH

Proponents of U.S. accession to the United Nations Convention on the Law
of the Sea (UNCLOS) maintain that the United States may not engage in
deep seabed mining unless and until it joins the convention. That is not
the case. [[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has]{.mark} [a
**sovereign and inherent right to mine the deep seabed**]{.mark} and has
successfully secured that right in the past through bilateral and
multilateral agreements with other nations that also engaged in seabed
exploration.]{.underline}

Accession to UNCLOS is simply not a viable option. The philosophical
basis of the convention, in the words of the preamble, is to "contribute
to the realization of a just and equitable international economic order
which takes into account the interests and needs of mankind as a whole
and, in particular, the special interests and needs of developing
countries."\[1\] [**[The]{.mark} [convention declares that the deep
seabed]{.mark}** [and its resources are the "**common heritage of
mankind**]{.mark}" and may be mined only "for the benefit of mankind as
a whole, irrespective of the geographical location of
States."\[]{.underline}2 \]

The resulting UNCLOS deep seabed mining regime, designed on that
philosophical basis and negotiated during the 1970s at the Third U.N.
Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III), is, unsurprisingly,
anachronistic---an international Rube Goldberg contraption conceived in
another time and place when the United States and the Soviet Union were
engaged in a global military and ideological contest.\[3\] The revisions
to the seabed mining provisions negotiated by the Clinton Administration
in 1994 did not and could not correct the convention's fundamental
flaws.\[4 \]

By acceding to UNCLOS, the United States would place itself and its
seabed mining companies under the regulatory power and control of the
International Seabed Authority, an international organization created by
the convention. U.S. companies would be forced to pay excessive fees,
costs, and an as yet undetermined percentage of royalties to the
Authority to fund its operations and to be redistributed to developing
countries. In short, U.S. accession would represent a radical sea change
because it would create an unprecedented layer of international
bureaucratic authority, oversight, and regulatory burden on American
companies.

However, [the [United States may advance its national interests without
acceding to the archaic]{.mark} and needlessly complex [regime]{.mark}
[established by UNCLOS]{.mark}. Mining the deep seabed is and always has
been a high seas freedom that every nation may exercise regardless of
membership in any treaty.]{.underline}

Deep Seabed Mining: A High Seas Freedom Available to All Nations

It is a basic principle of law that parties may not, by agreement among
themselves, impair the rights of third parties or their obligations to
third parties. [[Neither]{.mark} [the]{.mark} \[[Law of the
Sea]{.mark}\] Conference [nor the States indicating an intention]{.mark}
to become parties to the Convention [have been granted **global
legislative power.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

---U.S. Delegation at UNCLOS III (1983).\[5 \]

[[**No legal barriers** prohibit U.S. access,]{.mark} exploration, or
exploitation of the resources of the deep seabed.]{.underline} [[Deep
seabed mining is a **"high seas freedom"**]{.mark} [that all nations may
engage in]{.mark} regardless of their membership or non-membership in
UNCLOS or any other treaty. Like other high seas freedoms, **[the right
to engage in deep seabed mining is inherent to all sovereign nations
under customary international law.]{.mark}** Rather, it is the
convention that attempts to restrict access to the deep seabed and
infringe on the intrinsic rights of the United States and other nations
that have chosen to remain non-parties.]{.underline}

[High seas freedoms are not conditional on membership in a
treaty.]{.underline} [Neither the United States nor any other nation
need be party to UNCLOS to exercise them.]{.underline} While the
convention addressed and "codified" various high seas freedoms,
enjoyment of those freedoms is not conditional on membership. Rather,
high seas freedoms---including freedom of navigation and overflight,
freedom of fishing, freedom to lay submarine cables, and freedom to
engage in marine scientific research---are enjoyed and exercised
regularly by the United States and other UNCLOS non-parties based on
their status as sovereign and independent nations.

Instead of adhering to the Award[, [Beijing engaged in
"lawfare]{.underline}]{.mark}"139 [by enacting various domestic
laws]{.underline} reinforcing its maritime claims.140 [[In an effort
to]{.underline}]{.mark} legitimize the nine-dash line, these laws
[[introduce ambiguities]{.mark} regarding maritime boundaries [and
expand]{.mark} China's [influence over disputed zones]{.mark}, directly
challenging UNCLOS and [contradicting the]{.mark} established norms of
the [rules-based order]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}141 For example,
the Supreme People's Court has stated that the Chinese courts'
jurisdiction extends to all areas under the nation's "sovereign
control," including the islands in dispute.142 This regulation, [if
[fully implemented,]{.mark} [would]{.mark} directly [undermine
the]{.mark} role of [international courts and]{.mark} arbitral
[tribunals]{.mark} under UNCLOS to hear and adjudicate any future
maritime disputes]{.underline} arising out of the South China Sea.
Moreover, [its restructuring of several maritime law enforcement
agencies allows China to strategically manage and control the disputed
territories at sea.1]{.underline}43 To further controvert the
enforceability of the Award, [[Beijing]{.mark} passed the Coast Guard
Law of the People's Republic of China and the Maritime Traffic Safety
Law i]{.underline}n 2021,144 [which [emboldened Chinese law
enforcement]{.mark}]{.underline} with the authority
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} regulate waterways and [[intimidate
neighboring states]{.underline}]{.mark} if they were to sail into
China's claimed territories.145 Although Beijing argues that these
domestic regulations align with international laws, legal experts have
concluded that the majority of these provisions conflict with UNCLOS and
the Award.146 [To enforce its domestic maritime laws, [China has]{.mark}
resorted to the [use of physical force]{.mark} against other states'
vessels [and coercion of civilians to follow its preferred
order]{.mark}.]{.underline} Over the past few years, the Chinese
People's Liberation Army Navy ([PLA Navy) has repeatedly encroached upon
other coastal states' EEZ]{.underline}. The [[PLA Navy was]{.mark} also
[involved in]{.mark} numerous [intentional collisions and]{.mark}
deliberate [harassment]{.mark} of Japanese, Vietnamese, and the
Philippine fishing vessels]{.underline} across the South China Sea.147
In tightening its grip over the maritime region, China also has
established research stations, created new administrative districts, and
named geographic features within the disputed territories.148 In fact,
China has transformed many of these former "rocks" features into fully
militarized islands, arming them with advanced military defensive and
offensive equipment.149 An American Indo-Pacific Commander described
[[this a]{.mark}s "[the largest military buildup since world war two
\[]{.mark}sic\] by the PRC]{.underline}."150 Since the issuance of the
Award, [China's actions demonstrate that it has managed to underpin the
legitimacy of its nine-dash line, enabling the country to possess and
control one of the most desirable waterways in the
world]{.underline}.151 The consequences of these developments reveal
that [[China has]{.mark} largely [succeeded in]{.mark} deflecting
attention from the rulings and rendering the Tribunal's decisions
irrelevant, [indicating]{.mark} that [it is unwavering in opposing the
existing rules-based order]{.mark} under UNCLOS]{.underline}.152
Instead, [[through the enactment of]{.mark} [domestic laws]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} the use of [military force over]{.mark} the
years,153]{.underline} Beijing has steadily attained substantial
strategic, economic, and military advantages over the U.S. and
surrounding claimants, seeking to infringe, weaken, and alter general
principles of international law.154 As a result, the present
circumstances in the South China Sea are vastly different from those
envisioned by the UNCLOS drafters and its parties.

U.S.,\" Heritage Foundation,
<https://www.heritage.org/defense/commentary/un-sea-treaty-still-bad-deal-us>

UNCLOS is back. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
(aka, the Law of the Sea Treaty) was first hammered out in 1982. Twelve
years later, U.S. negotiators signed an amended agreement, but it was
never ratified. Now Sen. John F. Kerry, Massachusetts Democrat, is
pressing for Senate approval, claiming the treaty would give the United
States new rights and advantages. Unfortunately, it does not. [**[What
"rights" it recognizes already exist in customary international
law.]{.underline}** **[Treaty supporters claim ratification will give
the U.S. additional rights to oil, gas and minerals in the deep seabed
of its extended continental shelf. But the U.S. already has clear legal
title and rights to the resources of its continental
shelf]{.underline}**]{.mark} (even though the current administration
bans drilling there). Similarly, the treaty's navigational provisions
offer nothing new. Yes, the U.S. Navy says UNCLOS might improve the
"predictability" of these rights, but does the Navy's access to
international waters really depend upon a treaty to which we are not
even a member? The last time I checked, the U.S. Navy could go anywhere
it wanted in international waters. Though redundant, the navigational
provisions of UNCLOS are actually pretty good. That's why President
Ronald Reagan supported them. But Reagan and others objected to the
unaccountable international bureaucracy created by the treaty. UNCLOS
reflects the 1970's "new economic order" ideology that viewed ocean
riches as the "common heritage of mankind." Consequently, it establishes
a bureaucracy to redistribute the wealth of the deep seabed and the
extended continental shelf. [**[Were the U.S. to join, it would have to
share with "developing" nations any royalty revenue generated on its
continental shelf beyond the 200 nautical mile
mark.]{.underline}**]{.mark} The International Seabed Authority would
decide just how these revenues are distributed. [**[The U.S. by itself
would have no veto over its decisions.]{.underline}** **[Consensus often
works against U.S. interests]{.underline}** **[in the U.N. General
Assembly]{.underline}**]{.mark}, and it would do so in this
international body. Imagine how a U.N.-like body with a "right" to
distribute U.S. revenues would behave. The convention would also force
the U.S. to settle any claim brought against it by another treaty member
through a dispute resolution process. This process would be bound by
American law, but be buffeted by the fancies of international politics.
Corrupt nations game the U.N. for selfish gain. Given the chance, they
would do so here. [**[Opportunistic nations would lodge any number of
specious allegations, charging anything from environmental degradation
to poisoning the ocean with carbon emissions.]{.underline}** **[The U.S.
would be treaty-bound to adhere to whatever decisions are handed
down]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Treaty supporters like to claim that, were
he alive today, Reagan would support the treaty. It's hard to see how
they can divine this conclusion. In June 1982, Reagan noted in his diary
that he would oppose ratification of this treaty even if the deep seabed
mining provisions did not exist. Former Attorney General Ed Meese,
**[[Reagan]{.underline}]{.mark}**'s friend and confidant, says Reagan's
objection to the convention was largely philosophical. He didn't like
the idea of establishing an international bureaucracy that would
supersede U.S. rights of sovereignty. He **[[knew that other nations
would use this treaty to work against U.S. interests in ways not
imagined in the benign scenarios painted by its
supporters]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It is painful to read early accounts
by enthusiasts of the United Nations. They could scarcely have imagined
that Turtle Bay could produce such abominations as the resolution that
once equated Zionism with racism. Nor could they contemplate that
abusive regimes like those of Libya, Cuba, the former Soviet Union and
China would one day sit on the U.N. Commission on Human Rights and pass
judgment on the U.S. Reagan, however, was well aware of this potential.
He had seen it happen repeatedly. **[[That's why he opposed the Law of
the Sea Treaty.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[**[Trump's]{.mark} [tariffs]{.mark} [will be felt by
everyone]{.mark}**.]{.underline} U.S. consumers will see higher prices,
and [[U.S.]{.mark} business [will suffer from strong retaliatory
actions]{.mark} abroad and far more expensive inputs.]{.underline}

[Foreign governments are going to lengths to make U.S. consumers aware
of the negative impact that Trump's trade war is having on their
pocketbooks.]{.underline} The Canadian government has paid for billboard
advertisements in several American cities, noting that tariffs are a tax
on American consumers. And Volkswagen plans to add import fees to the
sticker prices of its vehicles shipped into the United States.

The Trump administration may be hoping that drastic tariffs will entice
foreign leaders to approach them with concessions. That is perhaps why
the country-specific tariffs will go into effect one week from the
announcement rather than "immediately" as the president had announced
earlier. [But [the]{.mark} [incentive for world leaders to]{.mark}
publicly [cave]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the [Trump]{.mark} administration's
bullying [is low]{.mark}.]{.underline} President Trump's deep
unpopularity abroad provides world leaders with a politically useful
foil. [Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has seen his electoral
fortunes turn around as he "stands up" to Trump.]{.underline} It is a
lesson that other countries are closely watching. [In Europe, British
Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron have
seen their popularity increase following their use of Trump as a foil.
Claudia Sheinbaum in Mexico, too, has benefited from her willingness to
counter Trump's coercive threats. As a result, tariff rates could
potentially remain high for some time, **as [world leaders choose to
retaliate in a show of strength]{.mark}** [rather than negotiate]{.mark}
with the Trump administration for lower rates, which could be
interpreted as weakness by their domestic constituencies.]{.underline}

In markets of geostrategic competition---particularly in Africa,
Southeast Asia, and Latin America---[the [Trump]{.mark}
administration['s]{.mark} [new]{.mark} [tariff regime must be viewed
alongside **its pullback of American aid.**]{.mark}]{.underline} [In
both instances, local economies that relied on **[relationships]{.mark}

HongruiH

[[Conflicts]{.mark} across the globe **[continue to fester]{.mark},**
undermining stability in critical regions. The window for diplomacy
appears to be narrowing, and the U.S., despite earnest efforts, is
running out of time.]{.underline}

[Repeated [appeals for peace]{.mark}, however persistent, **[have not
been sufficient t]{.mark}o break through the entrenched complexities**
of current crises.]{.underline} What was once touted as a "90 percent
done" deal in Gaza now seems a distant reality. [Just two weeks ago,
[a]{.mark} U.S.-backed proposal for a 21-day [cease-fire]{.mark},
designed to facilitate diplomatic engagement between Israel and
Hezbollah along the Blue Line, [failed]{.mark}]{.underline} to gain
traction and was followed by significant escalation. [[Mediation efforts
in]{.mark} [Sudan]{.mark} aiming to broker a cease-fire are under siege
as the Sudanese Armed Forces, one of the **[belligerent
parties]{.mark}** in the brutal civil war, [launch]{.mark}es [a]{.mark}
[new offensive.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Successful diplomacy requires a balance of incentives and consequences.
Offering rewards without accountability---the proverbial carrot without
the stick---rarely shifts the dial. It's not that the world lacks an
appetite for diplomacy or mediation. China's successful brokering of a
rapprochement between Iran and Saudi Arabia is a case in point.
Meaningful negotiations were possible at COP28, where difficult
concessions ultimately led to consensus. A groundbreaking new treaty on
intellectual property, genetic resources and associated traditional
knowledge was also adopted by consensus by the World Intellectual
Property Organization membership. Even more recently, Iranian officials
have indicated a willingness to engage in talks with the U.S.

Yet, despite these efforts, [Western [diplomacy has too often **missed
critical opportunities**]{.mark}. [Diplomatic]{.mark} [breakthroughs
have become **increasingly rare**]{.mark}, with few
exceptions]{.underline}. The United Arab Emirates' facilitation of
prisoner exchanges between Russia and Ukraine stands out as a success.
Turkey and Armenia have made good progress at normalizing ties after a
two-year lull.

Success, however, cannot be measured by new agreements and treaties
alone. [This year's main diplomatic achievement---the Pact for the
Future, endorsed at the United Nations General Assembly---faces serious
doubts about its ability to deliver on its promises]{.underline}. Beyond
the question of new treaties, [the pact raises larger [concerns about
whether international organizations like the]{.mark}]{.underline} [[UN
are still equipped to handle the **complexity**]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
modern [conflicts]{.mark}.]{.underline} Diplomacy must remain central,
whether in the context of full-scale war, escalating tensions, or
protracted stalemates[. So, how do we begin to account for the
stagnation in global diplomacy?]{.underline}

[The [Arctic region]{.mark} is another emerging [hotspot for underwater
natural resources]{.mark}]{.underline}, though of a somewhat different
character. [The Arctic Ocean and its adjacent seas hold not only
significant oil and gas reserves but also mineral deposits on and
beneath the seabed. As technology improves, previously inaccessible
Arctic seafloor areas are opening up for exploration---raising both
economic prospects and geopolitical tensions.]{.underline}

In terms of energy resources, the [Arctic is believed to contain a large
share of the world's untapped hydrocarbons]{.underline}. Estimates
suggest that the [Arctic could hold approximately 22% of the world's
undiscovered and recoverable fossil fuel resources]{.underline}---much
of it in the exclusive economic zones of Arctic coastal states. [For the
United States, Alaska's outer continental shelf forms part of this
potential.]{.underline}

Beyond oil and gas, there is [[growing interest in Arctic seabed
minerals]{.underline}]{.mark}. One notable example is Norway's recent
move to explore minerals in its Arctic waters. In January 2024, the
Norwegian Parliament voted to open approximately 280,000 square
kilometers of its northern seabed---an area between Svalbard and Jan
Mayen Island---for mineral exploration. However, Norway later paused
these plans. These delays and struggles have created turmoil for the
market, with at least one deep sea mining company declaring bankruptcy.
These mining efforts would have provided mineral resources critical for
national defense to a key NATO ally.

The Arctic's geopolitical profile means any underwater resource activity
there has strategic implications. The region is a locus of great power
interest: Russia has the largest Arctic coastline and has staked
assertive claims, including planting a flag on the seabed at the North
Pole in 2007, and China has declared itself a "near-Arctic state" with
an eye on Arctic shipping lanes and resources. Meanwhile, the United
States, Canada, Norway, and Greenland are coordinating through forums
like the Arctic Council on economic and environmental issues.

For U.S. policymakers, maintaining a strong presence and partnerships in
the Arctic is crucial to counterbalance Russian and Chinese ambitions.
Supporting allied initiatives can ensure friendly nations lead in Arctic
seabed resource development. Additionally, the U.S. can leverage its
technology and know-how, such as in offshore drilling technology for
cold environments, to benefit Arctic projects.

U.S. and Allied Exclusive Economic Zones

[[While international waters like the CCZ draw headlines]{.mark}, a
[significant]{.mark} portion of underwater [resources lies within
national jurisdictions---specifically, the EEZs of the U.S. and its
allies]{.mark}.]{.underline} Every coastal nation has sovereign rights
over resources in its EEZ, up to 200 nautical miles from shore. For the
United States and close partners, these [[zones present]{.mark} an
[opportunity to develop]{.mark} undersea [resources on home turf]{.mark}
or friendly territory, where strategic control is more
straightforward.]{.underline}

U.S. EEZ

[The **[United States possesses one of the largest EEZs]{.mark}** in the
world]{.underline}, spanning over 11 million square kilometers when
including areas off the Atlantic, Pacific, Gulf of America, and Arctic
coasts, to include around Hawaii, Alaska, and U.S. Pacific island
territories. [Within this vast area, [there are known deposits of
valuable minerals]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Parts of the [U.S. Pacific EEZ]{.mark} around [Johnston Atoll
and]{.mark} the [Hawaiian Islands]{.mark} are believed to [have
cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts on undersea mountain ranges]{.mark}.
These crusts can contain [high grades of cobalt, nickel, and rare
metals]{.mark}]{.underline}. The U.S. government and research
institutions have conducted surveys of such areas to assess their
potential.

Likewise, the U.S. EEZ in the Atlantic has [[hydrothermal vent
zones]{.mark} that [yield mineral-rich sulfides]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Although the U.S. has not yet moved to commercially exploit these seabed
minerals, they represent a [[strategic reserve]{.mark} that could be
tapped in the future. [**Developing them would occur under U.S. law and
oversight**, offering]{.mark} a degree of [regulatory predictability and
security of tenure that international projects might
lack]{.mark}]{.underline}. Additionally, the offshore oil and gas within
the U.S. EEZ---particularly in the Gulf of America and off
Alaska---continue to be linchpins of domestic energy production,
contributing to job creation and regional economies as well as national
energy stability.

https://www.unclosdebate.org/evidence/631/us-should-assert-its-rights-under-convention-high-seas-mine-and-develop-arctic//phs-DZ)

The most significant benefit to the United States\' argument that the
[[doctrine of]{.mark} the [high seas **still governs** the
Arctic]{.mark} Ocean and its [seabed]{.mark} is that [the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [would be able to **exploit** the vast natural
**resources** through d]{.mark}eep [s]{.mark}ea [m]{.mark}ining
activities.]{.underline} Unlike the freedom to navigate the high seas,
the freedom to mine that area is not explicitly guaranteed, although it
is clearly protected. By [[securing]{.mark} the [right to mine
and]{.mark} [exploit the resources]{.mark} beneath the Arctic Ocean, the
United States would be taking a step to **guarantee** its energy
independence and encouraging U.S. businesses to invest in deep sea
mining. These two things will, of course, be **critical** to the U.S.
economy in the foreseeable future.]{.underline}

By [[relying on]{.mark} the [**Convention** and the doctrine of the high

**[immediately]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As a further benefit, the
[[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [will not have to ratify UNCLOS]{.mark}
in order to secure these rights.]{.underline} In fact, if the United
States does ratify UNCLOS as many have called for, it may be
relinquishing these rights completely if no valuable territory is an

(in Argentina, Chile, Indonesia, Nicaragua, and El Salvador, among other
places) [[and]{.mark} actually [overthrow]{.mark} democratizing
[governments]{.mark}]{.underline} (in Chile, Guatemala, and Iran, for
example). In that era of the G.I. Bill, strong unions, employer-provided
healthcare, and general postwar economic dominance, to most of us who
were white and within reach of the middle class, the United States
probably did look like the best country in the world.

[Things do look a bit different [today]{.mark}, don't they?]{.underline}
In this century, in many important ways, [[the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [has become an outlier and,]{.mark} in some cases, even
[an outlaw]{.mark}.]{.underline} Here are three examples of US behavior
that has been egregious in the etymological sense, three ways in which
this country has stood out from the crowd in a sadly malevolent fashion.

[[Guantanamo]{.mark}, the forever prison camp]{.underline}

In January 2002, [the administration of President George W. Bush
[established an offshore prison camp]{.mark} a]{.underline}t the US
Naval Base in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. [The idea was to house prisoners
taken in what had already been labeled the "Global War on
Terror"]{.underline} on a little piece of "US" soil beyond the reach of
the American legal system and whatever protections that system might
afford anyone inside the country. (If you wonder how the United States
had access to a chunk of land on an island nation with which it had the
frostiest of relations, including decades of economic sanctions, here's
the story: in 1903, long before Cuba's 1959 revolution, its government
had granted the United States "coaling" rights at Guantanamo, meaning
that the US Navy could establish a base there to refuel its ships. The
agreement remained in force then, as it does today.)

In the years that followed, [Guantanamo [became the site of]{.mark}
the [torture and]{.mark} even [murder of
individuals]{.mark}]{.underline} the US took prisoner in Afghanistan,
Iraq and other countries ranging from Pakistan to Mauritania. Having
written for more than 20 years about such US torture programs
that began in October 2001, I find today that I can't bring myself to
chronicle one more time all the horrors that went on at Guantanamo or at
CIA "black sites" in countries ranging from Thailand to Poland, or at
Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, or indeed at the Abu Ghraib prison and
Camp NAMA (whose motto was: "No blood, no foul") in Iraq. If you don't
remember, just go ahead and google those places. I'll wait.

[Thirty men remain at Guantanamo today.]{.underline} Some have never
been tried. Some have never even been charged with a crime. [Their
[continued detention and torture]{.mark}]{.underline}, including, as
recently as 2014, punitive, brutal forced feeding for hunger strikers,
[[confirmed the status of the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [as a
global scofflaw]{.mark}.]{.underline} To this day, [keeping Guantanamo
open [displays this country's contempt for international law,
including]{.mark} the [Geneva Conventions and the U]{.mark}nited
[N]{.mark}ations [Convention against Torture.]{.mark}]{.underline} It
also displays contempt for our own legal system, including the
Constitution's "supremacy" clause which makes any ratified international
treaty like the Convention against Torture "the supreme law of the
land."

In February 2023, Fionnuala Ní Aoláin, the [UN's Special
Rapporteur]{.underline} on the promotion and protection of human rights
and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, [became the first
representative of the United Nations ever permitted to visit
Guantanamo]{.underline}. She [was horrified by what she found
there]{.underline}, telling The Guardian that the US has a
responsibility to redress the harms it inflicted on its Muslim torture
victims. [Existing medical treatment]{.underline}, both at the prison
camp in Cuba and for detainees released to other countries, [was
inadequate to deal with multiple problems such as traumatic brain
injuries, permanent disabilities, sleep disorders, flashbacks and
untreated post-traumatic stress disorder]{.underline}.

["These [men]{.mark},"]{.underline} she added, "[[are]{.mark} all
[survivors of torture, a unique crime under]{.mark} [international
law]{.mark}]{.underline}, and in urgent need of care. Torture breaks a
person; it is intended to render them helpless and powerless so that
they cease to function psychologically, and in my conversations both
with current and former detainees, I observed the harms it caused."

The lawyer for one tortured prisoner, Ammar al-Baluchi, reports that his
client "suffers from traumatic brain injury from having been subjected
to 'walling' where his head was smashed repeatedly against the wall." He
has entered a deepening cognitive decline, of which the "symptoms
include headaches, dizziness, and difficulty thinking and performing
simple tasks." He cannot sleep for more than two hours at a time,
"having been sleep-deprived as a torture technique."

The United States, Ní Aoláin insists, must provide rehabilitative care
for the men it has broken. I have my doubts, however, about the curative
powers of any treatment administered by Americans, even civilian
psychologists. After all, two of them personally designed and
implemented the CIA's torture program.

The United States should indeed foot the bill for treating not only the
30 men who remain in Guantanamo but others who have been released and
continue to suffer the long-term effects of torture. And, of course, it
goes without saying that the Biden administration should
finally close that illegal prison camp---although that's not likely to
happen. Apparently, it's easier to end an entire war than decide what to
do with 30 prisoners.

[Unlawful weapons]{.underline}

[The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is an outlier in]{.mark} another
arena as well: [the production and deployment of arms]{.mark} widely
recognized as presenting an immediate or future danger to
non-combatants]{.underline}. The [US has [steadfastly resisted joining
conventions]{.mark} [outlawing such weaponry]{.mark}, including cluster
bombs]{.underline} (or, more euphemistically, "cluster munitions") [and
landmines]{.underline}.

In fact, [the United States [deployed cluster bombs]{.mark} in its
wars]{.underline} in Iraq and Afghanistan. (In the previous century, it
dropped 270 million of them in Laos alone while fighting the Vietnam
War.) Ironically---one might even say, hypocritically---[the
US joined 146 other countries in condemning Syrian and Russian use of
the same weapons]{.underline} in the Syrian civil war. Indeed, former
White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that, if Russia
were using them in Ukraine (as, in fact, it is), that would constitute a
"war crime."

The [US has now sent cluster bombs to Ukraine]{.underline}, supposedly
to fill a crucial gap in the supply of artillery shells. Mind you, it's
not that the United States doesn't have enough conventional artillery
shells to resupply Ukraine. The problem is that sending them there would
leave this country unprepared to fight two simultaneous (and
hypothetical) major wars as envisioned in what the Pentagon likes to
think of as its readiness doctrine.

What are cluster munitions? They are artillery shells packed with many
individual bomblets, or "submunitions." When one is fired, from up to 20
miles away, it spreads as many as 90 separate bomblets over a wide area,
making it an excellent way to kill a lot of enemy soldiers with a single
shot.

What places these weapons off-limits for most nations is that not all
the bomblets explode. Some can stay where they fell for years, even
decades, until as a New York Times editorial put it, "somebody---often,
a child spotting a brightly colored, battery-size doodad on the
ground---accidentally sets it off." In other words, they can lie in wait
long after a war is over, sowing farmland and forest with deadly booby
traps. That's why then-Secretary General of the United Nations Ban
Ki-moon once spoke of "the world's collective revulsion at these
abhorrent weapons." [That's why 123 countries have signed the
2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions. Among the holdouts, however, are
Russia, Ukraine, and the United States]{.underline}.

According to National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, the cluster bombs
the US has sent to Ukraine each contain 88 bomblets, with, according to
the Pentagon, a failure rate of under 2.5%. (Other sources, however,
suggest that it could be 14% or higher.) This means that for every
cluster shell fired, at least two submunitions are likely to be duds. We
have no idea how many of these weapons the US is supplying, but a
Pentagon spokesman in a briefing said there are "hundreds of thousands
available." It doesn't take much mathematical imagination to realize
that they present a real future danger to Ukrainian civilians. Nor is it
terribly comforting when Sullivan assures the world that the Ukrainian
government is "motivated" to minimize risk to civilians as the munitions
are deployed, because "these are their citizens that they're
protecting."

I for one am not eager to leave such cost-benefit risk calculations in
the hands of any government fighting for its survival. That's precisely
why international laws against indiscriminate weapons exist---to prevent
governments from having to make such calculations in the heat of battle.

Cluster bombs are only a subset of the weapons that leave behind
"explosive remnants of war." Landmines are another. Like Russia, [[the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is not found among]{.mark} the 164
[countries that have signed the 1999 Ottawa
Convention]{.mark}]{.underline}, which required signatories to stop
producing landmines, destroy their existing stockpiles, and clear their
own territories of mines.

#### Increasingly violates international law.

from the Jesuit Review;

[[Americans used to be big supporters of international
law]{.underline}]{.mark}. It was President Woodrow Wilson who proposed
the League of Nations after World War I. Politics kept the United States
from joining, but after World War II the United States played a leading
role in creating the United Nations as well as the World Bank, the
International Monetary Fund and a host of other international
organizations. Because of new international trade and investment
agreements, intellectual property accords and treaties on the
environment, international law has grown; [yet when it comes to [waging
war]{.mark}, a cornerstone principle, [more and more the United States
acts as if i]{.mark}nternational [law applies to other]{.mark} countries
but [not to itself]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The law of war prohibits force unless force has been approved by the
U.N. Security Council or unless a country has been attacked and is
acting in self-defense. Even under those conditions, force is regarded
as a last resort, permissible only if it is likely to be successful.

[[Diminishing respect]{.mark} for international law can be [linked
to]{.mark} the rise of the United States as a military power after
[World War II]{.mark}, to the [domination of]{.mark} U.S. foreign policy
by [realists]{.mark} who emphasize U.S. military might and our
willingness to use it, and even to the civil rights and feminist
movements of the 1960s]{.underline}. As interest in the Constitution was
renewed, Americans turned inward and perceived the struggle for justice
almost exclusively through their own legal system.

According to Mary Ellen O'Connell, a professor of international law at
the University of Notre Dame, there has been a decline in the knowledge
of international law at every level of our society, from our highest
government officials to the person on the street. Along with that some
key misconceptions have taken hold---among them that international law
is ineffective and unenforceable. Such views are "factually incorrect,"
said O'Connell, author of the book The Power and Purpose of
International. Law.

[The terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, led the U[nited States to
embrace military force in a way it had not done before]{.mark}. Along
with that came indefinite [detention]{.mark}, [torture]{.mark} and the
[kidnapping]{.mark} of terrorism suspects and their rendition to [secret
black-box sites]{.mark}]{.underline}. But some of those abuses go back
before President George W. Bush, to the Clinton administration in the
1990s.

#### Makes a mockery of all treaties and international law -- not just UNCLOS.

analyst, writer, and teacher specializing in the geopolitics of the

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other members of the Biden
Cabinet are fond of proclaiming the "rules-based international order"
(RBIO) or "rules-based order" every chance they get: in press
conferences, on interviews, in articles, at international fora, for
breakfast, lunch, dinner, and cocktails. Along with the terms "human
rights" and "democracy," the RBIO is routinely used to claim a moral
high ground against countries that they accuse of not following this
RBIO, and wielded as a cudgel to attack, criticize, accuse, and
delegitimate countries in their crosshairs as rogue outliers to an
international order.

[This cudgel is now used most commonly against China and
Russia]{.underline}. Oddly enough, whenever the United States asserts
this "rules-based order" that China (and other "revisionist
powers"/enemy states) are violating, the United States never seems to
clarify which "rules" are being violated, but simply releases a miasma
of generic accusation, [leaving the stench of racism and xenophobia to
do the rest]{.underline}.

[This is because there is a [fundamental contradiction]{.mark} at the
heart of the RBIO.]{.underline}

The RBIO isn't "rules-based," it isn't "international," and it confounds
any sense of "order," let alone justice. It is, at bottom, the naked
exercise of U.S. imperial power and supremacy, dressed up in the
invisible finery of an embroidered fiction. The RBIO is a fraudulent
impersonation of international law and justice.

There are many layers to this misnomer, to be deconstructed piece by
piece.

'RBIO' in Contrast With 'International Law'

First, the RBIO is not "international" in any sense of the word.

There actually is a consensual rules-based international order, a
compendium of agreed-upon rules and treaties that the international
community has negotiated, agreed to, and signed up for. It's called
simply "international law." This refers to the body of decisions,
precedents, agreements, and multilateral treaties held together under
the umbrella of the Charter of the United Nations and the multiple
institutions, policies, and protocols attached to it. Although
imperfect, incomplete, evolving, it still constitutes the legal
foundation of the body of international order and the orderly laws that
underpin it: this is what constitutes international law. The basic
foundation of the UN Charter is national sovereignty---that states have
a right to exist, and are equal in relations. This is not what the
United States is referring to.

[When the [United States]{.mark} uses the term RBIO, rather than the
existing term "international law," it does so because it [wants to
impersonate international law while diverting to a unilateral]{.mark},
invented, fictitious [order]{.mark} that it alone creates and
decides]{.underline}---often with the complicity of other imperial,
Western, and transatlantic states. It also does this because, quite
simply, the United States does not want to be constrained by
international law and actually is an international scofflaw in many
cases.

[[The United States as International Outlaw]{.underline}]{.mark}

For example, [the United States [refuses to sign or to ratify]{.mark}
foundational [international laws]{.mark} and treaties that the vast
majority of countries in the world have signed]{.underline}, such as the
Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), CEDAW (the
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against
Women), ICESCR (the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and
Cultural Rights), CRC (the Convention on the Rights of the Child), ICRMW
(the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All
Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families), UNCLOS (the UN
Convention on the Law of the Sea), PAROS (the Prevention of an Arms Race
in Outer Space), the Ottawa Treaty (the Anti-Personnel Landmines
Convention), and the majority of labor conventions of the ILO
(International Labor Organization). In fact, the United States harbors
sweatshops, legalizes child labor (for example, in migrant farm labor),
and engages in slave labor (in prisons and immigration detention
centers). Even the U.S. State Department's own 2021 Trafficking in
Persons Report acknowledges severe problems in the U.S. of trafficking
and forced labor in agriculture, food service, manufacture, domestic
service, sex work, and hospitality, with U.S. government officials and
military involved in the trafficking of persons domestically and abroad.
[[Ironically]{.mark}, the United States [tries to hold other countries
accountable]{.mark} to laws that it itself refuses to
ratify]{.underline}. For example, the United States tries to assert
UNCLOS in the South China Sea while refusing---for decades---to ratify
it and ignoring its rules, precedents, and conclusions in its own
territorial waters.

[There are also a [slew of international treaties the United States has
signed, but simply violates anyway]{.mark}: examples include the
[Chemical Weapons Convention]{.mark}, the [Biological Weapons
Convention]{.mark}, [UN treaties]{.mark} prohibiting torture, rendition,
and kidnapping, and of course, war of aggression, considered "the
supreme international crime"]{.underline}---a crime that the United
States engages in routinely [[at least once a
decade]{.underline}]{.mark}, not to mention routine drone attacks, which
are in violation of international law. Most recently, the
[[AUKUS]{.mark} agreement signed between the United States and Australia
[violates]{.mark} the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ([NPT]{.mark}) by
[exploiting a blind spot]{.mark} of the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA).]{.underline}

There are also a [multitude of treaties that the United States has
[signed]{.mark}]{.underline} but then [[arbitrarily withdrawn from
anyway]{.underline}]{.mark}. These include the Joint Comprehensive Plan
of Action (JCPOA) with Iran, the Agreed Framework and the Six-Party
Talks with North Korea, the Geneva Conventions, the Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, and many others.

[There are also [approximately 368 treaties signed between the
Indigenous nations and the U.S. gov]{.mark}ernment; [every single
one]{.mark} of them has [been violated or ignored.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Serial US Violations of the UN Charter

In 1945, [the United Nations Charter was created "to save succeeding
generations from the scourge of war."]{.underline} The League of
Nations, which the United States refused to join, had failed to prevent
the rise of fascism and the Second World War. The objective of the
victorious powers of World War II in creating the UN system was to
ensure they would continue to control post-war international relations.
[But 75 years after the creation of the UN Charter, armed conflict --
particularly wars initiated by the United States -- continues to plague
the world.]{.underline}

[The [Charter requires]{.mark} that all [states **settle**]{.mark} their
[disputes **peacefully**]{.mark} and [refrain from]{.mark} the use of
[armed force except]{.mark} when acting in [**self-defense**
after]{.mark} an armed [attack by another state]{.mark}]{.underline}, or
when the Security Council authorizes it. Self-defense is defined by the
leading Caroline Case of 1837, which says the "necessity for
self-defense must be instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means
and no moment for deliberation."

[**U.S. Presidents** Continue to **Violate the Charter**]{.underline}

[[Yet]{.mark} the [five]{.mark} most [recent U.S. presidents]{.mark}
have [violated]{.mark} the [Charter]{.mark}'s prohibition on the use of
force. In October 2001, George W. [Bush invaded Afghanistan]{.mark},
even [though]{.mark} Afghanistan had not attacked the United States. On
September 11, 2001, 19 men (15 of whom were from Saudi Arabia) committed
crimes against humanity in the United States. But that **did not
constitute** an armed attack to trigger the article 51 **self-defense
provision** of the Charter. Bush's invasion of Afghanistan [did not
constitute]{.mark} [lawful self-defense]{.mark} and the [Security
Council **never approved**]{.mark} the [use of
force]{.mark}]{.underline}. Two years later, before he invaded Iraq and
changed its regime, [Bush tried to obtain the imprimatur of the Security
[Council]{.mark}, but it [refused]{.mark} to authorize "**[Operation
Iraqi Freedom]{.mark}**." [Bush then]{.mark} [cobbled together]{.mark}
[prior]{.mark} Security Council [resolutions from]{.mark} the first
[Gulf War]{.mark} -- which no longer applied in 2001 -- in an attempt
[to legitimize]{.mark} his [illegitimate war]{.mark}. Bush's war on Iraq
has resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths, led to the **rise of
ISIS**, and dangerously **destabilized the region**. Both of Bush's wars
-- in Afghanistan and Iraq -- **violated the UN Charter**.]{.underline}

[John [Bolton]{.mark}, then Bush's temporary ambassador to the United
Nations]{.underline}, admitted that the U.S. government considered the
UN to be a tool of its foreign policy. Bolton [[declared]{.mark}, "There
is no United Nations. There is an international community that
occasionally can be led by the **only real power** left in the world,
and that **is the U**nited **S**tates, when it suits our interest, and
when we can get others to go along.]{.underline}" Bolton added,
"[[When]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [leads]{.mark}, the
[U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations [will follow]{.mark}. [When]{.mark} it
**[suits our interest]{.mark}** to do so, [we will do
so]{.mark}."]{.underline}

Bush's predecessor could have helped prevent the genocide in Rwanda. But
instead, [Bill Clinton precluded the United Nations from acting to halt
the killing of 800,000 people. Madeline [Albright]{.mark}, [Clinton's
sec]{.mark}retary [of state]{.mark}, called the UN "a tool of American
foreign policy." It was Albright who [oversaw]{.mark} the **U.S.**-led
[NATO **bombing of Yugoslavia**]{.mark} in 1999, [which]{.mark} also
[violated]{.mark} the UN [Charter]{.mark}. Retroactive Security Council
approval does not comply with the Charter.]{.underline}

Barack [[Obama]{.underline}]{.mark} and his counterparts in France and
Britain [[secured]{.mark} a resolution]{.underline} from the Council
that [[approved]{.mark} a [no-fly-zone over Libya]{.mark} in
2011]{.underline}. [[But]{.mark} the three [countries]{.mark} engaged in
forcible regime change and [ousted]{.mark} Libyan president Muammar
[Qaddafi]{.mark}. This went far beyond what the resolution authorized.
That action also contributed to the current instability in the region.
The [Libya resolution mentioned]{.mark} the [**doctrine** of
"**Responsibility to Protect**]{.mark}."]{.underline} This doctrine is
contained in the General Assembly's Outcome Document of the 2005 World
Summit. [[But]{.mark} it is not enshrined in an international treaty nor
has it attained the status of customary international law. Paragraph 138
of that document says individual states have the responsibility to
protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing
and crimes against humanity.]{.underline} Paragraph 139 states that the
international community, through the UN, also has "the responsibility to
use appropriate diplomatic, humanitarian and other peaceful means, in
accordance with Chapters VI and VIII of the UN Charter, to help protect
populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes
against humanity." [It is not surprising that the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates and its allies have **[not utilized]{.mark}** the
Responsibility to Protect [doctrine to protect]{.mark} the people of
[**Gaza** from]{.mark} massacres by [Israel]{.mark}, most recently [in
2021]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Declaring the whole world to be his battlefield, [[Obama launched
**drone strikes**]{.mark} in Yemen, Pakistan, Libya, Afghanistan and
Somalia, Iraq and Syria. "We will hunt down terrorists who threaten our
country, wherever they are . . . if you threaten America, you will find
no safe haven]{.underline}," Obama declared. But none of those 7 states
had mounted an armed attack against the U.S. or any other UN member
country. And the [Obama administration [provided **no**]{.mark}
**[ev]{.mark}idence** that the [people]{.mark} it targeted [were about
to launch]{.mark} an [imminent attack]{.mark} on the United
States.]{.underline} Moreover, even if the U.S. Congress had authorized
Obama's wars, that still would not have complied with the UN Charter.

Donald Trump followed suit by bombing Syria and Iraq and threatening to
attack North Korea. [In 2017, [**Trump** sent]{.mark} 59 Tomahawk
[cruise missiles]{.mark} -- each armed with over 1,000 pounds of
explosives -- [to attack Syria]{.mark}]{.underline}, ostensibly in
response to Syria's alleged use of chemical weapons. [[Syria]{.mark}
[had not attacked]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates or any
other country [before]{.mark} Trump's missile
[strike]{.mark}]{.underline}. The use of chemical weapons by Syria did
not constitute an armed attack on the United States. And the Security
Council had not approved Trump's use of force. It therefore violated the
UN Charter. In fact, under the Charter, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad
would have had a valid self-defense claim since the U.S. had initiated
an armed attack on Syria. Moreover, after a rocket attack in Kirkuk
resulted in the death of a U.S. mercenary, [the United States retaliated
by launching several airstrikes in Iraq and Syria that killed 24 members
of the Iranian-backed Iraqi militia Kataib Hezbollah. But the attacks on
a U.S. military base in Iraq allegedly by Iraqi-based militias who were
Iraqi non-state actors did not constitute an armed attack on the United
States by Iran.]{.underline} On January 2, 2020, Trump ordered the
illegal drone assassination of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani while
he was in Iraq. Neither Iran nor Iraq had attacked the United States or
a UN member country and the Council did not authorize Trump's drone
attack.

[**[Article 2]{.mark}** of the Charter [states]{.mark} that all [members
"shall refrain]{.mark} in their international relations [from]{.mark}
the [threat]{.mark} or use of force [against]{.mark} the **[territorial
integrity]{.mark}** or political independence [of any state]{.mark}."
[Trump's threat to]{.mark} "totally **[destroy No]{.mark}rth
[Ko]{.mark}rea**" [violated]{.mark} the Charter's mandate. The
preemptive use of force violates the Charter.]{.underline}

One month after Joe Biden was inaugurated as U.S. president, he followed
in the footsteps of his predecessors by violating the UN Charter. On
February 25, 2021, [**[Biden]{.mark}** conducted [airstrikes in
Syria]{.mark} on buildings allegedly belonging to Iran-backed militias
who were allegedly responsible for attacks against U.S. and allied
personnel in Iraq. [Syria, however]{.mark}, had [not mounted]{.mark} an
armed [attack on]{.mark} the [U.S.]{.mark} or another country,
[and]{.mark} the Security [Council had not]{.mark} [approved]{.mark} the
attack.]{.underline}

George Kennan, architect of the U.S. containment strategy against the
Soviet Union, made a striking admission. "We have 50% of the world's
wealth, but only 6.3% of its population ... Our real task in the coming
period is to devise a pattern of relationships which will allow us to
maintain this position of disparity," Kennan noted. "We should cease to
talk about the raising of the living standards and democratization. The
day is not far off when we are going to have to deal in straight power
concepts." If they had not been given the power to veto Security Council
decisions, the U.S. and the USSR would not have joined the UN. One of
the major sticking points during the conference was the scope of the
veto power. Australian foreign minister Gareth Evans described the
motivation behind giving the permanent members the power to veto
decisions of the Security Council. He said, "to convince the permanent
members that they should adhere to the Charter and the collective
security framework embodied therein, a deliberate decision was taken to
establish a collective security system which could not be applied to the
permanent members themselves." The Security Council has 15 members --- 5
permanent members (U.S., UK, France, Russia, and China) and 10 rotating
non-permanent members. The Soviet Union wanted the permanent members to
have veto power over all decisions of the Security Council, which would
have allowed them to prevent discussion about the peaceful settlement of
disputes in which they were involved. A compromise was reached that
gives the permanent members a veto over "substantive" matters. But the
peaceful settlement of disputes is considered a "procedural" matter.
Some feared the veto would permit the big powers to use their military
might against the small nations with no accountability. A group of
prominent Protestant ministers called it "a mere camouflage for the
continuation of imperialistic policies and the exercise of arbitrary
power for the domination of other nations." Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba,
Switzerland, Italy and the Vatican thought the proposed voting structure
was inconsistent with the sovereign equality of states and would place
the permanent members above the law. The word "veto" does not appear in
the UN Charter. Article 27 says that decisions on procedural matters
"shall be made by an affirmative vote of nine members including the
concurring votes of the permanent members." One permanent member could
therefore exercise veto power by withholding a concurring vote. The
U.S., UK, China and the Soviet Union -- the sponsoring powers of the
conference -- issued formal invitations. Fifty countries, primarily from
the industrialized North, were represented at San Francisco. They made
up less than one-quarter of the countries of the world. About 35 were
allied with the U.S., 5 were aligned with the Soviet Union, and 10 were
non-aligned. At the time, most of the developing countries were under
colonial or semi-colonial rule. During the conference, conflicts erupted
between the big powers and countries of the South. The Latin American
contingent was comprised of 19 countries that had been non-belligerents
during the War. However, since they had declared war on the Axis
countries by the deadline, they were allowed to join the United Nations.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt had a warm relationship with Latin
America, stemming from his Good Neighbor Policy in the 1930's, which
provided for non-intervention and non-interference in the domestic
affairs of the countries of Latin America. In return, the United States
expected favorable trade agreements and the reassertion of U.S.
influence in the region. But Roosevelt died 13 days before the San
Francisco conference, leaving Harry Truman to represent the United
States in negotiations over the UN Charter. Although the Latin American
countries sought to include Brazil as the sixth permanent Security
Council member, the United States prevented its inclusion. The Latin
bloc sought to establish its own regional security system apart from the
UN. The Act of Chapultepec, developed at a prior Inter-American
conference in Mexico City, specified that an attack on one state in the
region was an attack on all, which would result in immediate collective
consultation and possible military action. Objecting to a provision in
the UN Charter that would give the permanent members the power to veto
any action by a regional organization, the Latin countries advocated the
principles of Chapultepec. The final draft of article 51 of the UN
Charter protects "the inherent right of individual or collective
self-defense." In deference to the Latin bloc, "collective" is a
reference to Chapultepec.

\<\<PARAGRAPH INTEGRITY RESUMES\>\>

Article 2 of the Charter provides, "Nothing contained in the present
Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which
are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state." The
original proposal stated that international law would determine what is
"solely within the domestic jurisdiction" of a state. When [the U.S.
[Congress **demanded**]{.mark} that the words "**[i]{.mark}nternational
[law]{.mark}**" be **[removed]{.mark}**, they were deleted. [Since
then]{.mark}, not surprisingly, the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has
[repeatedly violated i]{.mark}nternational [law by]{.mark} the [use of
armed force]{.mark} in violation of the Charter.]{.underline}

[The [Charter established]{.mark} the International Court of Justice
([ICJ]{.mark}) [as]{.mark} the [judicial arm]{.mark} of the UN
system]{.underline}. Would states be compelled to submit to its
jurisdiction? U.S. Secretary of State Edward Stettinius convinced Truman
that the U.S. Senate would never ratify an ICJ statute with that
provision. The court therefore has contentious jurisdiction only over
states that consent to its jurisdiction. [Indeed, [when]{.mark} the [ICJ
ruled]{.mark} in 1986 that the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates had
**[violated i]{.mark}nternational [law]{.mark}** [by mining
Nicaragua]{.mark}'s harbors [and supporting]{.mark} the [Contras]{.mark}
in their insurrection against the Nicaraguan government, [the U.S.
refused]{.mark} to be bound by [the ruling]{.mark}.]{.underline}

For 45 years during the Cold War, the veto power paralyzed the Security
Council. But after the dissolution of the USSR in 1991, the veto
ironically turned the Security Council into a countervailing power to
the U.S., as [the [Council is]{.mark} the [only]{.mark}
[int]{.mark}ernationa[l body that can]{.mark} **legitimately
[authorize]{.mark}** the use of [military force]{.mark}.]{.underline} In
some instances, the United Nations has succeeded in slowing down an
immediate resort to military force, although it has failed to broker a
solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, or develop a treaty to
outlaw nuclear weapons. [The [U.S. gov]{.mark}ernment has
[sought]{.mark} to obtain the Security [Council's blessing for]{.mark}
its [military interventions]{.mark}. [But]{.mark} as the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates nevertheless [**continues** to use **armed
force**]{.mark} in violation of the UN Charter, [it is apparent to the
countries]{.mark} of the world [that the U.S. is a **notorious
lawbreaker**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Action Against China's South China Sea Assertions,\" Modern Diplomacy,
https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2025/02/25/understanding-the-lack-of-legal-action-against-chinas-south-china-sea-assertions/

The South China Sea is a strategic body of water bordering Brunei
Darussalam, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand,
Vietnam, and China. As one of the busiest trade routes in the world and
home to a wealth of marine and mineral resources, the South China Sea
holds great economic and geostrategic importance. **[[Countries have
wrangled over territory in the South China Sea for centuries, but
tension has grown in recent years]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In particular,
**[[China's sweeping claims that violate]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
**[[(UNCLOS]{.underline}]{.mark}**), which **[[include sovereignty
claims over land parcels and their adjacent
waters]{.underline}]{.mark}**, have angered competing claimants like
Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Brunei (BBC, 2024). The
maritime disputes in the South China Sea are far from being localized
conflicts; rather, they hold both regional and global implications,
impacting the delicate balance of power and international law. As stated
before, many countries are affected by the act of China, but other than
the Philippines, **[[there are no major legal actions against
China]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Why don't countries take legal actions
regarding China's violation of UNCLOS in the South China Sea? The United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is an international
agreement that establishes guidelines for businesses, the environment,
and the management of marine natural resources (IMO, 2012). This
agreement plays an important role in the way China is claiming
territories. We have to acknowledge the role of UNCLOS in assisting to
provide governance arrangements for the maritime domain in certain
circumstances and note that China intends to work constructively over
the coming decade to help refine it (Shi, 2015). However, a Japanese
writer named Atsuko Kanehara (2018) argues that China's sovereignty in
the South China Sea is not a subject that UNCLOS should be adjudicating
because China's claim is based on historic rights that are defined under
a regime independent of UNCLOS. Moreover, it contends that the continued
insistence of some countries in attempting to use UNCLOS to frame the
debate about China's claim in the South China Sea is not only incorrect
but is also increasing the risk of regional instability. In 2013, the
Philippines, under UNCLOS, initiated an arbitral procedure against
China. In this respect, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA), on
July 12, 2016, issued its award, which was with the Philippines,
declaring that significant parts of China's claims, its nine-dash line
and new land reclamation activities, were illegal. Seeing many
perspectives regarding this heated state of the South China Sea, there's
a lack of information given as to the reason why other countries
impacted by China's action did not take legal action against China;
thus, the research question of this writing was birthed.** **Despite
many theories in the International Relations realm, the theory of
neorealism will come to play in this writing. Neorealism is a theory
that emphasizes the role of power politics in international relations,
which sees competition and conflict as enduring features and sees
limited potential for cooperation (Lobell, 2017). Neorealism was a
purely systemic theory, one that focused on the characteristics of the
international system structure, rather than the nature of individuals or
states. Rather, it posited a minimalist concern with survival in an
anarchic setting as the only necessary condition. Through the neorealism
theory, this writing will discuss in depth the main reasons how
neorealism theory can navigate the tension in South China Sea regarding
China's violation of UNCLOS.**[[Several countries in the South China
Sea]{.underline}]{.mark}**, both individually and collectively,
**[[pointed out China's serious violations of
UNCLOS]{.underline}]{.mark}** in this region. **[[Vietnam has condemned
China's]{.underline}]{.mark}** interference in its oil and gas
exploration activities as continually claiming territorial jurisdiction
over areas belonging to Vietnam. This also includes those cases where
the Chinese Coast Guards patrolled Vietnamese territories without
permission, in blatant disregard for the provisions under UNCLOS that
ensure marine preservation and prevent damage to fragile ecosystems.
**[[ASEAN members have also collectively voiced their
unease]{.underline}]{.mark}** concerning unilateral acts by China,
calling for compliance with international law, in addition to promoting
a rules-based maritime order. Though the individual reactions may vary
because some have more or less engagement with China, the sentiment
carries the shared frustration of blatant disregard of UNCLOS by China
and the destabilization of the region as a result. A researcher named Ky
Nguyen (2018) mentioned that the international system of neorealism is
anarchic, meaning no overarching authority enforces the rules and judges
their disputes. In this kind of system, states are dependent upon their
capabilities to secure themselves and their interest. He added that the
**[[countries surrounding the South China Sea do believe that taking
legal action against a powerful state would lead to military and
economic retaliation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Therefore,
**[[they]{.underline}]{.mark}** tend towards self-help measures and
**[[remain hostile to legal actions as well because they fear that legal
steps may provoke a more crushing retaliatory response from China that
would cast a bad effect on their security
situation.]{.underline}]{.mark}** He added that neorealists contend that
states are more concerned about relative gains---that is, their own
power and security compared to others---than with absolute gains. This
mindset discourages cooperation if it might enhance the power of a
rival. It can thus be ruled out in the South China Sea by any nation
that sees it as a tool to provoke China to force it into aggressive
actions against them. Instead, such nations might choose to employ a
status quo that offers a situation of less conflict while still
safeguarding their interests. Increased military ability and an
assertive foreign policy have brought China to a hegemonic position in
the region of Southeast Asia (Tokuchi, 2022). Knowing this, neorealists
would suggest that weaker states will usually seek to balance against a
dominant power, rather than confront such a power. Countries may prefer
to negotiate through diplomatic means and soft bargaining through
multilateral discussions within ASEAN rather than push through with
legal action perceived to be confrontational. In doing so, the countries
aim at balancing to avoid head-on conflict with China while still
putting across their claims. The neorealist view also highlights the
importance of alliances and strategic calculations in international
relations. Smaller countries can decide that taking legal action could
further isolate them from potential allies or even destabilize regional
cooperation. They may prefer to negotiate informally or to seek support
from greater powers, such as the United States, that exercise freedom of
navigation operations but themselves do not claim territorial rights on
certain regions. Lastly, the reason countries hesitate to take legal
action against China roots from concerns about security, relative gains,
power dynamics, and strategic considerations regarding alliances; these
concerns make countries prioritize stability and a sense of
self-preservation over potentially confrontational legal battles. On top
of it, the **[[ambiguous interpretation of
UNCLOS]{.underline}]{.mark}**, added to China's historical claims, makes
legal action not so clear-cut. In the final analysis, such dynamics
underline a strategic choice of diplomacy over legal action among
smaller nations in navigating the complex geopolitical landscape of the
region.

though Article 56 only grants coastal States exclusive jurisdiction over

counterbalance China's egregious maritime claims and disdain for
international norms and standards by becoming a party to UNCLOS. By
joining the Convention, the United States will be in a better position
to ensure that the law of the sea is interpreted and evolves in a way
that preserves the rules-based legal order that has brought peace and
stability to the world's oceans.

Introduction

The 30th anniversary of the opening for signature of the UN Convention
on the Law of the Sea (LOSC or the Convention) will no doubt be marked
by many positive and complimentary remarks being made about the
Convention. However, at the risk of being a party-pooper, I want to
[focus here on a negative aspect]{.underline}: [the problem of
**persisting and widespread non-compliance** with the
Convention]{.underline}. I begin by giving some examples of such
non-compliance and explaining why I consider it to be a problem that
merits serious attention. I then suggest some ways in which the current
situation could be improved.

Non-compliance with the Convention

For reasons of space, I cannot attempt here any detailed or
comprehensive survey of non-compliance with the LOSC, nor is it
necessary to my case to do so. It is sufficient to give a number of
varying and persisting examples to show that non-compliance continues to
be a problem.

[[Some States]{.mark} parties, including Bangladesh, Egypt, Myanmar and
Vietnam, have [drawn straight baselines]{.mark} in ways [that **do not
meet**]{.mark} the requirements of [Article 7]{.mark}]{.underline}, even
on the most generous interpretation of the admittedly imprecise
provisions of that Article.1

[[Four States]{.mark} parties (Benin, Philippines, Somalia and Togo)
still [claim a territorial sea]{.mark} [**with a breadth in excess** of
the 12 nautical miles]{.mark} permitted by Article 3.]{.underline}

[[12 States]{.mark} parties, including China, Haiti, India, Pakistan and
Saudi Arabia, have [included security as one of the matters]{.mark} in
respect of [which they claim to exercise]{.mark} jurisdiction in their
contiguous zones, [contrary to Article 33]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[A [few States parties]{.mark}, including Japan]{.underline}, have
[[sought to delimit an]{.mark} exclusive economic zone ([EEZ]{.mark})
[and continental shelf]{.mark} from uninhabitable rocks, [contrary to
Article 121]{.mark}(3).]{.underline}

[A [considerable number of]{.mark} flag [State]{.mark} parties [are in
breach of]{.mark} their obligation under [Article 94]{.mark} to exercise
effective jurisdiction and control in respect of the seaworthiness of
ships having their nationality]{.underline}, as revealed by the record
of inspections and detentions of unseaworthy ships carried out by port
States under various regional Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) on port
State control. In particular, such States include those on the black
list of flag States, and possibly even those on the grey list, published
each year by the Paris and Tokyo MoUs.2

The biennial reports on the State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture
published by the FAO show that for the past decade or more nearly 30% of
fish stocks are over-exploited.3 This indicates that some coastal States
parties (notably the European Union (EU))4 are in breach of their
obligation under Article 61(2) to ensure that the maintenance of the
living resources of their EEZs is not endangered by over-exploitation;
and that some States parties are in breach of their obligation under
Articles 117--119 to conserve the living resources of the high seas.
Furthermore, it has been estimated that as much as one-third of the
total global marine fish catch is taken illegally.5 Not all such
illegality is necessarily a breach of the LOSC, but a good deal
certainly is.

[A [number of States]{.mark} parties [are in breach of their obligations
under Article 194]{.mark}(5) by [failing to take]{.mark} the necessary
[measures to protect]{.mark} and preserve rare or fragile
[ecosystems]{.mark}, for example by permitting fishing using explosives
in the vicinity of tropical coral reefs or by permitting bottom trawling
on seamounts and areas of cold-water coral reefs in their
EEZs.]{.underline}

Why Non-compliance Matters

Some may seek to downplay the significance of non-compliance with the
LOSC by arguing that a certain level of non-compliance is to be expected
in any legal system: as long as it is kept within reasonable bounds,
there need be no undue concern. I believe that this is too sanguine a
view. [There are [just over 160 parties]{.mark}]{.underline} to the
LOSC, [**[at least one-third]{.mark}** of which ([and]{.mark} quite
possibly [more]{.mark}) **[are in breach of at least one]{.mark}
[significant provision]{.mark}** [of the LOSC]{.mark}]{.underline}. Such
a degree of non-compliance [undermines the integrity and legitimacy of
the LOSC.]{.underline} Furthermore, non-compliance [[provokes disputes,
denies States parties some of their LOSC rights, threatens good order at
sea, and harms the marine environment.]{.underline}]{.mark}

How Could Non-compliance with the LOSC Be More Effectively Addressed?

The first and most obvious answer is by making more use of the
mechanisms that already exist for trying to induce or coerce States
parties into complying with the LOSC. The LOSC itself provides three
such mechanisms. The first is the Commission on the Limits of the
Continental Shelf (CLCS), which, in examining States' submissions
relating to the establishment of the outer limit of the continental
shelf beyond 200 nautical miles and making recommendations thereon, is
designed to prevent non-compliance with Article 76 of the LOSC. The CLCS
does not, however, pass opinion on ancillary issues of compliance, such
as the validity of baselines from which 200- and 350-nautical-mile
limits are delimited or whether a continental shelf is being claimed
from Article 121(3)-type islands; nor does it have the expertise to do
so. The second mechanism is the International Seabed Authority (ISA),
whose duties include seeking to ensure compliance with the rules
governing the exploration and exploitation of mineral resources in the
Area. The CLCS and ISA are of little relevance to the present discussion
because up to now non-compliance in relation to the matters with which
they deal has not been a problem.

Of far greater relevance is the third compliance mechanism of the LOSC,
the system of compulsory dispute settlement found in Part XV. This has
so far been used comparatively little to deal with issues of
non-compliance: only 17 cases alleging non-compliance by a State party
have been brought, of which eight concern the failure to release fishing
vessels promptly on payment of a bond or other security. Only two of the
cases (the Southern Bluefin Tuna and Swordfish cases)6 concern any of
the instances of non-compliance referred to earlier, and in neither of
those cases was there a judgment on the merits. Use of Part XV presents
a striking contrast with use of the World Trade Organization's (WTO)
Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU),7 which also provides for
compulsory dispute settlement and which came into force only a few weeks
after the LOSC. No less than 440 cases have so far been brought under
the DSU. Part of the reason for the stark difference in numbers is that
usually far more, economically speaking, will hang on a WTO dispute than
on LOSC non-compliance; and the former, unlike the latter, invariably
involves direct injury to other States.

States parties to the LOSC may have been put off using Part XV to
challenge non-compliance by the cost and bother of bringing a case,
especially where Annex VII would be the forum. The latter is likely to
be the situation because of the small number of States that have chosen
the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) as their
preferred means of settlement---although where a matter has been
referred to arbitration, it can always be transferred by agreement to
the ITLOS to reduce the cost, as has already happened in some cases.
States may also be discouraged from litigating because some kinds of
non-compliance may fall within the matters excepted from compulsory
dispute settlement under Articles 297 and 298, and because of
uncertainty as to whether they have sufficient legal interest to bring a
case. The latter ought not to be a problem: Article 48 of the
International Law Commission's (ILC) Draft Articles on State
Responsibility8 suggests that it should be possible for any party to the
LOSC to challenge non-compliance by another. It is quite surprising that
more use has not been made of Part XV because it provides the
possibility for a more decisive outcome than most other means of
challenging non-compliance. A good example involves Japan's claim to be
able to establish an EEZ and continental shelf from Okinotorishima. This
is clearly contrary to Article 121(3), as at high tide Okinotorishima
comprises two isolated lumps of rock, one the size of a bedroom, the
other scarcely larger than a double bed. China and South Korea have
mounted a diplomatic campaign to challenge Japan's claim. So far, they
have tried, without success, to put the matter on the agenda of the
annual meetings of the States Parties to the LOSC and of the ISA. They
have also objected to Japan's submission to the CLCS in respect of
Okinotorishima. This has resulted in the CLCS deciding to defer a
decision on this aspect of Japan's submission until the three States
have resolved their dispute over the matter.9 It would have been much
quicker, and would have produced a more decisive result, if China and
South Korea had referred the matter for judicial settlement. Indeed,
they still could do so.

Apart from the non-compliance mechanisms of the LOSC, States can also
seek to induce compliance by utilising the traditional mechanisms of
international law, namely protest, retorsion, counter-measures and
action under Article 60 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties
(VCLT).10 Numerous protests have been made with respect to
jurisdictional claims considered not to be in conformity with the LOSC.
They rarely seem to have had any effect, although just occasionally (as
with the modification by Philippines of its non-complying archipelagic
claims) protests do appear to have persuaded a State to conform. Some
use has been made of retorsion, for example the trade measures employed
by Chile against EU vessels fishing in the south-east Pacific (which
gave rise to the Swordfish litigation) and the EU's ban on imports of
IUU-caught fish, insofar as such measures may be justified under Article
XX of the GATT.11 If they cannot, they would in theory be
counter-measures, although there is considerable doubt over whether WTO
members may impose trade restrictions as counter-measures. There would
appear to be scope for a greater use or threat of counter-measures to
induce compliance with the LOSC than has occurred hitherto, although
such action may be inhibited by the fear that counter-measures may have
adverse effects on the State utilising them and by uncertainty as to
whether they may be invoked by non-injured States (a matter that the
ILC's Draft Articles on State Responsibility leave open). In theory
States could also seek to induce compliance by threatening to terminate
or suspend the LOSC vis-à-vis a non-complying State party for material
breach, in accordance with Article 60 VCLT. However, it is doubtful
whether many, if any, instances of non-compliance with the LOSC amount
to material breach within the meaning of Article 60. Even if the LOSC
was suspended, the State at which such an action was directed would
continue to enjoy most of its LOSC rights under customary international
law.

The possibility of using the UN Security Council to induce compliance
with the LOSC has recently been revealed. In one of its many resolutions
on Somalia (which continues to claim a 200-nautical-mile territorial
sea) and Somali piracy, adopted under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, the
Security Council "emphasizes the importance of the earliest possible
delimitation of Somalia's maritime spaces in accordance with the \[Law
of the Sea\] Convention."12 It is not inconceivable that in future where
a threat or breach of the peace arose out of a State asserting
jurisdiction in a way contrary to the LOSC, the Security Council would
call on the State concerned to amend its legislation to conform to the
LOSC.

Mechanisms in other treaties may help to induce compliance with the
LOSC. It has already been mentioned that the Paris MoU has, indirectly,
identified flag States in breach of Article 94. The Paris MoU has
recently been amended in ways that should put greater pressure on flag
States to improve their performance and thus promote compliance with
Article 94. Ships that have the nationality of States on the black or
grey lists and that have been detained in the past are to be banned,
temporarily or permanently, from entering Paris MOU ports. A shipowner
whose ships have the nationality of a State on the black or grey lists
might well consider re-registering such ships under the flag of a State
on the white list in order to avoid the risk of their being banned from
Paris MOU ports. Such a move would reduce the income from ship
registration that the previous flag State received. That might persuade
the latter to exercise its responsibilities more diligently so that it
was removed from the black and grey lists. In doing so, it would
probably have brought itself into compliance with Article 94. Other
examples could be given involving regional fisheries management
organizations and marine pollution conventions, but lack of space
precludes further consideration here.

The discussion so far has been all about using existing mechanisms to
seek to persuade non-complying States to conform to the LOSC. Could new
mechanisms be created for this purpose? There is no point considering
mechanisms that would require the negotiation and adoption of a new
treaty because there is likely to be little enthusiasm among States
parties for this. There are, however, one or two possibilities that do
not require a new treaty. The first would be for the Meeting of States
Parties to the LOSC to take on the role of monitoring compliance. The
Meeting itself is too unwieldy and political a body to undertake such a
task. It could, however, delegate it to a committee. It might be
objected that the Meeting has no competence to establish such a
committee. However, the Meeting has already shown itself capable of
taking decisions where there was no clear authority in the LOSC to do
so, notably when it extended the time limit for making submissions to
the CLCS.13 However, on that occasion there was a clear consensus to
take action. There is unlikely to be such a consensus for establishing a
compliance committee, as many developed States are opposed to widening
the role of the Meeting. In any case, even if such a committee were
established, it is not clear that it could take any action to induce
compliance other than by naming and shaming States that it had found to
be in non-compliance and urging them to comply. Another possibility
would be for the UN Secretary-General to highlight instances of
non-compliance in his annual reports on oceans and the law of the
sea.14 In the past he has occasionally done so in general terms.
However, he is unlikely to want to do so by identifying States by name
as this is likely to be perceived as political interference and as
compromising his neutrality.

So far the discussion has been all about negative means, i.e., ways of
seeking to induce States to comply with the LOSC by threatening some
form of sanction. But there may also be some scope for positive
measures. Some non-compliance may be due to a lack of adequate capacity.
For example, the failure of many West African States to prevent the
over-exploitation of the fishery resources of their EEZs is probably due
to a lack of the necessary capacity to take adequate enforcement
measures against fleets from East Asia and Europe fishing illegally in
their waters. In some cases, therefore, help in capacity building may be
the most appropriate way to promote compliance with the LOSC.

Conclusion

[[In 1982]{.underline}]{.mark} it may have been reasonable, if perhaps
somewhat optimistic, to hope that [the [LOSC would]{.mark}, in the words
of its preamble, [establish a "legal order]{.mark} for . . . the oceans
which . . . will [promote the peaceful use]{.mark}s of the seas and
oceans, . . . the [conservation of]{.mark} their [living resources
and]{.mark} the . . . [preservation of the]{.mark} marine
[environment]{.mark}." [Thirty years later]{.mark} it is **[clear
that]{.mark} the [LOSC has failed to achieve those]{.mark}
[goa]{.mark}**[ls]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is in part [[due to
continuing non-compliance]{.underline}]{.mark} with many of its
provisions. Such non-compliance [is a matter of serious
concern]{.underline} for all the reasons suggested earlier. It
could---and should---be addressed by States parties making more use of
Part XV of the LOSC (perhaps non-governmental organizations could
persuade or help States to bring test cases); by considering more use of
retorsion and counter-measures; and by developing compliance mechanisms
for other treaties that indirectly help to promote compliance with the
LOSC. In some cases assistance in capacity building may also be
appropriate.

[Researchers have discovered a **new antibiotic molecule that targets a
broad range of** disease-causing **bacteria**]{.underline} --- [even
strains resistant to commercial drugs]{.underline} --- and is not toxic
to human cells1.

The molecule was found in soil samples collected from a laboratory
technician's garden. The discovery shows that "there is terrifically
interesting stuff hiding in plain sight", says Kim Lewis, a
microbiologist at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, who
was not involved in the research. "Kudos to them that they knew what to
look for."

[The latest molecule targets bacteria's protein-making factory, the
ribosome]{.underline}, in a way that other antibiotic drugs don't. The
[ribosome is an attractive antibiotic target because **bacteria don't
easily develop resistance to drugs targeting the structure**, adds
Lewis.]{.underline}

The search for new antibiotics is necessary because bacteria
acquire resistance to existing drugs with continued use. In 2021,
bacterial resistance to antimicrobial drugs was associated with 1.1
million deaths globally, a figure that could increase to 1.9 million by
2050.

#### Antibiotics are being found that can counteract bacteria from developing resistance

**Joel '25** \[Lucas Van Wyk Joel; February 24, 2025; Joel is a
professional journalist who specializes in natural and physical
sciences; he is a senior science writer for the University of
California; he is a regular contributor to the Science Times section of
the New York Times; he is a fellow for the National Science Foundation

accessed 07-16-2025**\] NT-LY

There's an arms race in medicine -- scientists design drugs to treat
lethal bacterial infections, but bacteria can evolve defenses to those
drugs, sending the researchers back to square one. In the *Journal of
the American Chemical Society, *a University of California, Irvine-led
team [describes the development of a drug candidate that can stop
bacteria before they have a chance to cause harm.]{.underline}

"The issue with antibiotics is this crisis of antibiotic resistance,"
said Sophia Padilla, a Ph.D. candidate in chemistry and lead author of
the new study. "When it comes to antibiotics, bacteria can evolve
defenses against them -- they're becoming stronger and always getting
better at protecting themselves."

About 35,000 people in the U.S. die each year from antibiotic-resistant
bacterial infections from pathogens like *Staphylococcus*, while about
2.8 million people suffer from bacteria-related illnesses.

"It's a big problem," said James Nowick, a Distinguished Professor of
chemistry at UC Irvine who co-led the study.

The [team designed a new family of antibiotics that's a variation of an
existing drug called vancomycin]{.underline}, which is used as a last
resort for extremely ill patients. The new version of [vancomycin
targets, bonds to and **renders inactive two different parts of** a
molecule on the surfaces of **pathogenic bacteria.**]{.underline}

Nowick likens the process to grabbing the bacteria with both hands and
subduing it. "What's happening at the molecular level is there are two
pieces that can be targeted and that can be grabbed on to," he said.

This new version of vancomycin could be a giant leap forward. [By
binding molecules that bacteria need to build a protective cell wall,
**the drug may help end the antibiotic-bacteria arms race** and
eliminate the need for researchers to continuously design new drugs to
treat newly evolved strains of antibiotic-resistant
bacteria.]{.underline}

Padilla explained that the arms race is an ongoing and expensive
endeavor. "It doesn't really solve the problem," Padilla said. "In terms
of antibiotic development, I believe we shouldn't focus solely on
modifying what we already know works, but rather take a step back and
adopt a new approach."

Padilla and Nowick hope their new family of antibiotics inspires other
researchers to explore similar approaches for treating
antibiotic-resistant pathogens in non-traditional ways.

"What's a new way that we can develop an antibiotic that doesn't require
us to keep doing the same thing over and over again?" said Padilla.  "I
think with our approach, and the approach of several others, [we're
starting to target something that bacteria will most likely not evolve
resistance to."]{.underline}

dubbed KAMRA I, [to finance]{.mark} life sciences **[companies working
to combat]{.mark}** the growing global threat of [antimicrobial
resistance]{.mark}]{.underline}. Some of this funding has gone toward
setting up Kinvard Bio, which is developing antibiotics called
oxepanoprolinamides [[that are]{.mark} being touted as [offering highly
effective]{.mark} and differentiated [binding to the bacterial
ribosome]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Oxepanoprolinamides are [[a class of]{.mark} lincosamide
[antibiotics]{.mark} the origins of which lie]{.underline} in the lab of
Professor Andy Myers, Ph.D., at Harvard\'s Department of Chemistry and
Chemical Biology. [These drugs [have]{.mark} already [proven]{.mark}
their [**effectiveness** against]{.mark} both gram-positive and
gram-negative [bacterial pathogens in preclinical **studies**]{.mark},
according to Kinvard Bio's Feb. 24 release.]{.underline}

This research team previously received \$1.2 million from the Combating
Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator to evaluate
several potential therapies with the aim of "advancing them to the later
stages of the drug discovery pipeline," according to the release.

Kinvard Bio has now secured the license to this oxepanoprolinamide tech
and is working toward taking potential therapies into the clinic. The
biotech's initial focus is on infections with high unmet need such as
complicated urinary tract infections, community-acquired bacterial
pneumonia, hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and nontuberculous
mycobacterial lung disease.

"[The powerful synthetic [methods]{.mark} we\'ve [developed]{.mark} at
the Myers Lab [have enabled]{.mark} us to create [a series of
compounds]{.mark} that hold great promise [**for treating**
superbugs]{.mark} resistant to standard treatments]{.underline}," Myers
said in this morning's release. "Licensing these compounds and the
synthetic platform for further development should accelerate the
production of essential antibiotics to address the pressing global
health issues caused by drug-resistant infections."

Kinvard Bio is headed up by Lloyd Payne, Ph.D., who was previously CEO
of antibiotic company ArrePath and currently is a venture partner for
the KAMRA I fund.

financial resources, as well as important technical support to help
biotech companies bring novel antibiotics to patients. The AMR Action
Fund is an initiative of the international body representing the R&D
pharmaceutical industry (International Federation of Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers & Associations, IFPMA).

[AMR is a looming global crisis that has the potential to dwarf
COVID-19]{.underline} in terms of deaths and economic costs. While
tragically the death toll of COVID-19 continues to rise, each year
700,000 people are dying from AMR. In some of the most alarming
scenarios, it is estimated that by 2050 AMR could claim as many as 10
million lives per year.

"Unlike COVID-19, AMR is a predictable and preventable crisis. We must
act together to rebuild the pipeline and ensure that the most promising
and innovative antibiotics make it from the lab to patients," said
Thomas Cueni, Director General of the IFPMA, one of the organizers of
the new fund. He adds: "[T[he AMR Action Fund is]{.underline}
]{.mark}[one of [the largest]{.mark} and most ambitious [collaborative
initiative]{.mark}s ever under[taken by the pharmaceutical
industry]{.mark} to respond to a global public health
threat]{.underline}".

"Antimicrobial resistance is a looming global public health challenge.
We are proud to support the AMR Action Fund, with the goal to help
discover innovative solutions for a pressing unmet medical need," said
Stefan Oelrich, member of the Board of Management of Bayer AG and head
of the Pharmaceuticals Division. "No company or no organization can
weather these crises in isolation. Covid-19 has impressively shown us
what's possible in the face of adversity."

The world urgently needs new antibiotics, but there are few in the
pipeline because of a paradox: despite the huge societal costs of AMR,
[[there is currently no viable market for]{.mark} new
[antibiotics]{.mark}. New [antibiotics are used sparingly to preserve
effectiveness]{.mark}, so in recent years, [a number of antibiotic
focused biotechs have declared **bankruptcy**]{.mark} or exited this
space due to the lack of commercial sustainability, resulting in the
loss of valuable expertise and resources.]{.underline} The consequence
is a huge public health need for new antibiotics, but a lack of funding
available for antibiotic R&D, particularly the later stages of clinical
research. This creates a "valley of death" between discovery and patient
access.

#### US destroying marine life now

It's also why countries around the world have been creating [marine
protected areas]{.mark}.

These protected areas, covering over 11.6 million square miles (30
million square kilometers) in 16,000 locations, offer refuge away from
human activities for a wide variety of living creatures, from corals to
sea turtles and whales. [They [give fish stocks]{.mark} a [place to
thrive]{.mark}, and those fish [spread]{.mark} out [into]{.mark} the
[surrounding waters]{.mark}, which [helps fishing industries and local
economies]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In the U.S., [however]{.mark}, **[marine [protection]{.mark} is [being
dismantled by]{.mark} President Donald [Trump]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Trump [issued]{.mark} a proclamation on [April 17]{.mark}, 2025, titled
"Unleashing American commercial fishing in the Pacific," ordering [the
[removal of key protections]{.mark} to [allow commercial fishing]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} parts of a nearly-500,000-square-mile marine protected area
called the Pacific Island Heritage [National Marine
Monument]{.mark}]{.underline}.

He also [called]{.mark} for a review of [all other marine national
monuments to decide]{.mark} if they should be [open]{.mark}ed [to
commercial fishing]{.mark} too. In addition, the Trump
[[administration]{.mark} is [proposing to redefine "harm" under]{.mark}
the [Endangered Species Act]{.mark} in a way that would [allow for
**more damage**]{.mark} [to]{.mark} these species'
[habitats]{.mark}]{.underline}.

I'm a marine biologist and scuba diver, and it's no accident that all my
favorite dive sites are within marine protected areas. I've found what
scientific studies from across the world show: **[[Protected]{.mark}
[areas have much healthier marine]{.mark} life [populations and
healthier ecosystems]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

What's at risk in the Pacific

The Pacific Island Heritage National [Marine Monument]{.mark}, about 750
miles west of Hawaii, is dotted by coral reefs and atolls, with species
of fish, marine mammals and birds rarely found anywhere else.

It is [[home to protected and endangered species]{.underline}]{.mark},
including turtles, whales and Hawaiian monk seals. Palmyra Atoll and
Kingman Reef, both within the area, are considered [among]{.mark} the
[most]{.mark} [pristine coral reefs]{.mark} in the world, each
[providing]{.mark} [habitats]{.mark} [for]{.mark} a [wide range
of]{.mark} fish and other [species]{.mark}.

These marine species are able to thrive there and spread out into the
surrounding waters because their habitats have been protected.

President George W. Bush, a conservative Republican, created this
protected area in 2009, restricting fishing there, and President Barack
Obama later expanded it. [[Trump]{.mark}, whose administration has made
no secret of its aim to **[strip away environmental
protections]{.mark}** across the [country's land and waters]{.mark}, is
now reopening much of the marine protected area to industrial-scale
fishing.]{.underline}

The risks from industrial fishing

When too many fish are killed and too few young fish are left to replace
them, it's considered [[overfishing]{.mark}, and this has become a
[growing problem]{.mark} around the world]{.underline}.

In 1974, about 10% of the world's fish stocks were overfished. By 2021,
that number had risen to 37.7%, according to the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization's annual State of Fisheries and Aquaculture
Report.

Modern industrial-scale fishing practices can also [harm other
species]{.mark}.

Bycatch, or catching animals that fishermen don't want but are
inadvertently caught up in nets and other gear, is a threat to many
endangered species. Many seabirds, sea turtles and whales die this way
each year. Some types of [fishing gear]{.mark}, such as trawls and
dredges that drag along the sea floor to scoop up sea life, can
[**[destroy ocean habitat]{.underline}**]{.mark} itself.

Impact

People depend on biodiversity in many ways. Human health relies on
ecosystem resources, products and services (such as fresh water, food
and fuel sources; the regulation of crop pests and diseases; and the
regulation of air, water and soil quality) which are needed for good
health and productive livelihoods. Biodiversity loss can [have
[significant]{.mark} direct health [impacts if ecosystem]{.mark}
[services no longer meet societal needs]{.mark}]{.underline}. Changes in
ecosystems can **[[affect livelihoods, income, local migration]{.mark}

Significant medical and pharmacological discoveries are made through

[benefits]{.mark} for biological, health, and pharmacological
sciences.]{.underline} It is also the [source of]{.mark} traditional and

Biodiversity loss also [has [profound economic
consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}, particularly in sectors like
agriculture, fisheries and healthcare. It is [estimated]{.mark} that
[the global economic [impact]{.mark} of biodiversity loss [amounts to
**US\$ 10 trillion annually**]{.mark},]{.underline} including healthcare
costs from increased disease transmission and agricultural losses from
pollinator declines. For example, the [[decline in bee
populations]{.mark}, which are responsible for pollinating crops [worth
over US\$ 235 billion annually]{.mark}, [threatens global food security
and nutrition]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Threats to biodiversity and health

Biodiversity loss is occurring at an alarming rate, with recent
estimates showing that [species]{.mark} [extinctions]{.mark} are
currently [**[10 to 100 times]{.underline}** higher than the natural
baseline]{.mark}. This is largely due to human activities like
deforestation, habitat fragmentation, and climate change. This loss
**[[threatens essential ecosystem services]{.mark}, including
pollination, soil fertility, and water purification, with direct
consequences for human health]{.underline}**. For example, the
degradation of wetlands, which filter freshwater, has led to a 35%
decline in global wetland coverage since 1970, [[increasing]{.mark}
waterborne [diseases]{.mark} [and reducing water]{.mark} availability
[for over 2 billion people]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation are becoming [major health
concerns]{.mark}. When ecosystems are disrupted, services like clean

**[increase biodiversity loss]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Higher economic
development also impacted biodiversity loss positively. On the other
hand, good governance such as the control of corruption, regulatory
quality, and rule of law reduces biodiversity loss. Thus, practicing
good governance, promoting conservation of the environment, and the
control of greenhouse gasses would able to mitigate biodiversity loss.

Introduction

Biological diversity or its common abbreviation,
[biodiversity,]{.underline} has been [defined as "the totality (numbers)
and variability (types) of living organisms in the ecosystem, region and
the environment"]{.underline} (Butler 2006). The diversity and the
interrelationships within species, between species, and of ecosystem are
fundamental for human health and well-being (GRI 2007; UNEP 2002).
[[Biod]{.mark}iversity provides mankind in a variety of ways --
economically, environmentally, and culturally]{.underline} (GRI 2007;
UNEP 2002; European Commission 2008). Economically, [biodiversity
[provides econ]{.mark}omic [benefits to industries that depend]{.mark}
[on natural resources]{.mark}]{.underline}, [a nation's economic growth
in particular countries depending on oil and gas explorations, source of
food, shelters, fresh water, wood and fiber, fuel, and clean air to the
population.]{.underline} [Biodiversity [subscribes to]{.mark} various
[environmental services such as regulating]{.mark} the [climate]{.mark},
control of [pollution]{.mark} and [soil erosion]{.mark}, ecological
balance, environmental conservation, support species diversity, and
[pollination]{.mark} of various crops]{.underline}. In terms of culture,
"biodiversity has an intrinsic value. [Its support our cultural
identity, offers spiritual inspiration and solace and plays an important
role in our mental and physical well-being"]{.underline} (European
Commission 2008: pp. 4). It also provides educational values, esthetic
and medicinal values, ethical values, and recreational values for the
development of ecotourism and conservation.

The importance of biodiversity has caught the world's attention. In
1992, the leaders of 150 countries signed the "Convention on Biological
Diversity (CBD)" during the Rio Earth Summit, with the commitment to the
biodiversity conservation, biological sustainable resources, and
equitable sharing of benefits from biodiversity (Earthwatch
Institute 2002). However, for almost 3 decades, this effort has not been
a success. In fact, none of the 20 Aichi biodiversity targets has been
fully achieved globally (CBD, 2020). The World Wildlife Fund (WWF 2020)
portrays an alarming picture of the global biodiversity. According to
the Living Planet Index 2020, between 1970 and 2016, [the [population
sizes]{.mark} of amphibians, birds, fish, mammals, and reptiles [have
decreased]{.mark} an average of [68%]{.mark}]{.underline} as forecasted
earlier by WWF (2016).

Figure 1 presents an increasing trend in the number of threatened
species worldwide. [The [number of threatened species]{.mark} -- plants,
fishes, amphibians, mollusks, birds, mammals, insects, and reptiles --
has [shown an **increasing trend**]{.mark} for the last two
decades]{.underline}. For example, for the 10-year period from 2006 to
2015, fishes, mollusks, and reptiles experienced biodiversity loss at an
annual average rate of 8.0%, 8.5%, and 12.5%, respectively. According to
WWF (2016), "[the declined in species is [due to a **variety of
factors** including]{.mark} **unsustainable agriculture**,
**fisheries**, **[mining]{.mark}**, [**habitat** **loss**]{.mark} and
**[degradation]{.mark}**, **[overexploitation]{.mark}**, [**climate**
**change**]{.mark} and **[pollution]{.mark}**]{.underline}". On the
other hand, Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA 2005) reported that
[60% of the ecosystem has been degraded or used
unsustainably]{.underline}. It was found that the [world's ecosystem
changed more rapidly in the second half of the twentieth century than at
any time in human history. Over the past few hundred years, [humans have
increased]{.mark} the [species extinction]{.mark} rate [by]{.mark} as
much as [1000 times]{.mark} over the planet's history.]{.underline}

Numerous studies have reiterated that **[one of the most important
drivers of the current loss of biodiversity is climate
change]{.underline}** (MEA 2005; Brook et al. 2008; Guo et al. 2017).
The rise of temperature and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels has been
associated with global climate changes. These effects give rise to
several potentially major changes in hydrologic cycles (precipitation
and evaporation) and an [[increasin]{.mark}g magnitude and [frequency of
extreme weather]{.mark} such as floods, cyclones, and droughts that will
[have a profound negative impact on biod]{.mark}iversity]{.underline}
(Adler et al. 2009; Rinawati et al. 2013). According to Tol (2009),
climate change is the mother of all externalities and has a profound
impact on biodiversity not only through changes in temperature and
precipitation, but also the ways [climate change [might affect
ocean]{.mark} acidification, [land]{.mark} use and nutrients,
[and]{.mark} also the proliferation of invasive alien species into new
[habitats]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} On the other hand, Thomas et
al. (2004) point out that [climate change [could result in]{.mark} the
[extinction of]{.mark} more than [a **million terrestrial
species**]{.mark} in the next 50 years.]{.underline}

The purpose of the present study is to investigate the effects of
climate change on biodiversity loss using worldwide data on the total
number of threatened species (proxy for biodiversity loss). The
CBD (2019) defines biodiversity loss as the loss of the components of
biodiversity that includes biomes, habitats, and ecosystem; species and
populations; and genetic diversity (CBD COP 7 Decision VII/30). In other
words, biodiversity loss is a reduction in the variety of life on Earth
(Chivian and Bernstein 2010). Biodiversity loss in this study is proxy
by the number of threatened species, namely, amphibians, birds, fishes,
mammals, mollusks, plants, and reptiles. On the other hand, to proxy for
the climate change variables, we have included the number of natural
disasters occurrences, temperature, and precipitation. As for the
control variable, we have included real gross domestic product (GDP)
(proxy for the level of economic development) and governance indicator.
Our study is different from the previous works in three aspects: (1) we
have included three measures of climate change variables and hypothesize
to impact biodiversity loss; (2) we have included amphibians, birds,
fishes, mammals, mollusks, plants, and reptiles as proxy for
biodiversity loss; and (3) we employ robust regression approach (the
M-estimator) in our analysis.

Literature review

Climate change is the term used to describe a gradual increase in the
average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere and its ocean. Due to
global warming, the species that live in the forest will be affected,
both by changing habitat and in direct response to temperature increases
and changes in precipitation and extreme weather events (Sarkar 2012).
During the 1990s, climate change emerged as one of the potential threats
to biodiversity (UNEP 2002). Furthermore, climate change could lead to
severe adverse impacts on ecosystems and on the goods and services they
provide (IPCC 2001). Climate change is an umbrella crisis in that it has
social, economic, political, and ecological impacts, including
biodiversity loss (Rosales 2008). Evidences have shown that climate
change can affect biodiversity among other things, by changing life
cycles and developing new physical traits and by shifting habitat ranges
and species distribution, changes in abundance, changes in migration
patterns, and changes in the frequency and severity of pest and disease
outbreaks (Reed 2012; Hui 2013; Sintayehu 2018).

Empirical studies that have been conducted to investigate the impact of
climate change on the loss of biodiversity are rather lacking. For
example, earlier work by Asafu-Adjaye (2003) by using dummy variable to
account for climatic effects on biodiversity found that climate change
has positive impact of the number of threatened mammals, birds, and
plants. Similar work by Shandra et al. (2010) by using dummy variable to
measure climate change, however, found that tropical climate has no
effects on the number of threatened species -- mammals and birds, but
when using forest loss as proxy for biodiversity loss, Shandra et al.
(2011) found evidence that tropical climate affected forest loss or
deforestation.

On the other hand, Gren et al. (2016) have investigated the effects of
climate change on biodiversity loss at the global scale by using both
temperature and precipitation to proxy for climate change. The effects
of climate change such as the increased in temperature and precipitation
affect individual organisms, populations, species distribution, and
ecosystem compositions and functions (UNU-IAS 2010; Reed 2012).
Similarly, Amano et al. (2018) also include both temperature and
precipitation in their study on global waterbird populations. Findings
from both studies show positive relationships between biodiversity loss
and both temperature and precipitation. [The increase in temperature and
precipitation increases the loss of biodiversity.]{.underline}
Villen-Perez (2020) also found that [climate change has affected plant
species in Finland]{.underline}. The temperature-sensitive species in
all functional groups from dwarf shrubs, herbs, and grasses to
bryophytes and lichens migrate northwards to cooler climate.

Nevertheless, [the effects of climate change through **extreme weather
events** such as floods, cyclones, and droughts also have **profound
negative impacts** on biodiversity]{.underline}. Thus, the [occurrences
of natural disaster would have a positive impact on biodiversity
loss]{.underline}. [[Natural disasters]{.mark} could be the results of
**earthquakes**, **extreme** **temperature**, volcanic eruptions,
**[landslides]{.mark}**, **[storms]{.mark}**, **[wildfire]{.mark}**,
**[flood]{.mark}**, and **[drought]{.mark}**.]{.underline} A country
that frequently experiences one or more of these catastrophic events
will have a devastating impact on biodiversity. Wagstaff (2017) pointed
out that **[[deforestation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [increased in the
frequency of wildfires, severity of tropical storms, and extreme
floodings]{.underline} (see also Chapin and Diaz 2020) [have tragically
[resulted in]{.mark} the [loss of biod]{.mark}iversity.]{.underline}

Studies by Miura and Kanaya (2017), Porwal et al. (2012), and Fattorini
et al. (2018) on earthquake; Bixby et al. (2015) on wild fire; Milner et
al. (2013) on flood; Kwit et al. (2000) on hurricane; Fraver (2017) on
tornado; and Darnaedi and Zulkarnaen (2017) and Lallement et al. (2016)
on volcanic eruptions clearly indicated the devastating impact of these
natural events on the ecosystem, habitat, and biotic. For example, [the
2011 Japan earthquake resulted in the disappearance of vegetation and
altered habitat structure through changes in topography, bottom
elevation, and sediment characteristics which induced drastic changes in
associated biotic communities]{.underline} (Kanaya et al. 2017; Miura
and Kanaya 2017). [Natural disasters]{.underline} such as earthquakes,
landslides, floods, droughts, forest fires, extreme low temperature, and
freezing rain have [led to the destruction of many species in
China]{.underline} (Guan 2017). In Indonesia, Darnaedi and Zulkarnaen
(2017) reported that the [Krakatau volcanic eruption has affected
biodiversity of the islands around Krakatau]{.underline}, the western
part of Java, and the southeastern part of Sumatra. On the other hand,
in India, the December 2004 tsunami has impacted the archipelago of
Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The island suffered great loss of forest
and coastal biodiversity, in which the mangroves, littoral forest, beach
forest, and low land swamp were most affected (Porwal et al. 2012).

Methodology

To estimate the impact of climate change on biodiversity loss, following
the work of others (Asafu-Adjaye 2003; Shandra et al. 2010; Gren et
al. 2016), we specify the following augmented biodiversity loss-climate
change equation. In this study, we have included the number of natural
disaster occurrences, temperature, and precipitation to proxy for
climate change:

where the parameters  are to be estimated and ϵi indicates the error
term. The error term is assumed to well behave with mean zero and
constant variance. It is a priori that we expect α1, α2, α3, and α4\> 0
and α5\<0. Thus, there is a positive relationship between climate change
(natural disaster, temperature, precipitation) and biodiversity loss, in
which increase in the frequency of natural disaster events, temperature,
and precipitation will lead to an increase in the loss of biodiversity,
and on the other hand, the control variables such as wealth of the
nation (realGDP) will impact biodiversity loss positively, while good
governance (governance) will affect biodiversity loss negatively. The
subscript "i" refers to country. In this study, we employ
cross-sectional data analysis for 115 countries. The list of countries
included in the study is presented in Table 1.

For the dependent variable, we follow the works of Naidoo and Adamowicz
(2001), Asafu-Adjaye (2003), Hoffmann (2004), Shandra et al. (2010), and
Halkos (2011) to proxy biodiversity loss by using the number of
threatened species at the country level. In this study, we summed all
the critically endangered and vulnerable categories of amphibians,
birds, fishes, mammals, mollusks, plants, and reptiles. This
classification was given by the International Union for the Conservation
of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Animals.
According to Hoffmann (2004), the Red List is a comprehensive listing of
threatened and endangered species in most nations and the most widely
used source on threatened and endangered species (see also Ryden et
al. 2020; Bennun et al. 2018; Gren et al. 2016).

As for the control variable, we use real GDP to proxy for the wealth of
a nation or level of economic development. GDP can be a good indicator
to operationalize "treadmill of production theory" of the impact of
economic growth on environmental degradation (York et al. 2003;
Schnaiberg and Gould 1994). For a country to strive for higher level of
economic development, it requires that higher level of economic output
to be produced. It is predicted that higher GDP may stimulate demand for
agricultural and forest-derived product and may cause deforestation,
thus increasing the number of threatened species (Asafu-Adjaye 2003;
Culas 2007; Shandra et al. 2010). Furthermore, Rosales (2008) reiterates
that "economic growth is a prime catalyst of biodiversity loss because
people desire economic growth for dissimilar reasons -- some for the
increased accumulation of wealth, others for basic needs". Rosales
further notes that because economic growth is the increase of production
and consumption of goods and services, these goods and services derive
from the ecosystem that we live; thus, the impact of economic growth on
the natural world increases with the size of the economy, and achieving
higher economic growth comes with a price. For example, according to Suh
(2006), in the USA, a dollar's worth of goods or services produced, on
average, 0.36 kg of CO2 goes into the atmosphere. Thus, economic growth
is said to be the main driver in increased GHG emissions. Furthermore,
Wilting et al. (2017) reiterated that the GHG emissions associated with
the production and consumption of goods and services will result in
biodiversity loss.

On the other hand, Eagles (2009) asserts that conservation of diversity
can only be attained through good governance and good management. In
fact, Baynham-Herd et al. (2018) posited that governance has been shown
to be an important predictor of biodiversity loss. For example, a poorly
governed country or a corrupt government is less likely to invest in
infrastructure for conservation; willing to allow poaching, illegal
logging, and other illegal activities; and lower enforcement of
environmental laws that can act as incentive for overexploitation of
resources (Ferraro 2005; Eklund et al. 2011), ultimately resulting in
environmental degradation and biodiversity loss.

Study that link governance and the loss of biodiversity was conducted by
Smith et al. (2003). In their study, the governance indicator was based
on the Corruption Perception Index produced by the Transparency
International and also the International Country Risk Guide, while
biodiversity loss was proxy by using changes in forest cover and African
elephant and black rhinoceros populations. They found strong negative
relationship between governance scores and changes in the number of
African elephants and black rhinoceroses and in forest cover. On the
contrary, similar study by Barrett et al. (2006) found that governance
has no effects on biodiversity loss, after taking into account other
control variables such as population density, human development index,
and per capita GDP. Nevertheless, recent studies reinforce the link
between good governance and the loss of biodiversity. For example,
Melick et al. (2012) posited that poor governance and lack of political
will on the part of the government of Papua New Guinea that led to most
of the protected areas ineffective. Lack of government support and lack
of funding and resources retard conservation efforts.

In another study, Amano et al. (2018) investigated the impact of
effective governance on the global waterbird populations. They found
that waterbirds are abundance in countries that are having effective
governance. In countries or regions of western and central Asia,
sub-Saharan Africa, and South America, where governance is on average
less effective, the number of waterbird declines. According to Amano et
al. (2018), ineffective governance is associated with the absence of
positive attitudes to environmental protection, weakly enforced
environmental legislation, low levels of investment in conservation,
ineffective hunting regulations, and political instability resulted in
habitat loss and degradation. On the other hand, a study by Baynham-Herd
et al. (2018) also suggested the importance of governance in mitigating
biodiversity loss. They found that governance was an important predictor
of responses to biodiversity conservation than economic wealth. This
result corroborates with earlier findings by McClanahan and Rankin
(2016) and Rodrigues et al. (2014) that wealth is unrelated to
protecting threatened species.

Empirical results

In this study, [we have [compiled]{.mark} a **cross-national of [115
countries]{.mark}** [using data]{.mark} for the year 2011 and 2016 for
the analysis.]{.underline} Data for the number of threatened species
were compiled from the Red List published by IUCN. Data for the number
of natural disaster occurrences was compiled from the Office of Foreign
Disaster Assistance (OFDA)/Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of
Disaster (CRED), while data on temperature and precipitation were taken
from the World Bank database on temperature and precipitation which is
available at https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org/download-data.
On the other hand, data for real GDP were compiled from the World
Development Indicators available at the World Bank database. It is
accessible at https://data.worldbank.org/indicator, while data on
governance indicators were collected from the Worldwide Governance
Indicators (WGI) at http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/. Worldwide
Governance Indicators published six governance indicators, namely,
control of corruption, government effectiveness, political stability and
absence of violent, regulatory quality, rule of law, and voice and
accountability (see Kaufman et al. 2008).

Table 2 provides the descriptive statistics for the dependent and
independent variables in our analysis. More importantly, it shows that,
in general, most dependent and independent variables demonstrate
substantial standard deviations, skewness, and kurtosis. In all cases,
we have positive value of skewness (except temperature and political
stability for having negative skewness) for all variables, while
kurtosis with size greater than 3 was shown by all dependent variables
and real GDP. These indicate that the series show longer or fatter tail
on the right side of the distribution. In other words, the kurtosis
shows a leptokurtic type of distribution for all the threatened species
as well as for real GDP. Nevertheless, the Jarque-Bera test for
normality of the series was rejected for all series except for political
stability. In view that many of the variables involved in our analysis
demonstrate extreme skewness and kurtosis and have non-normal
distribution; the common method to circumvent these problems is to
transform all variables into logarithm (McKinney et al. 2009; Naidoo and
Adamowicz 2001; Ehrhardt-Martinez et al. 2002). In this study, we employ
the formula  to transform the series into logarithm (Busse and
Hefeker 2007). By employing this method, we maintain the sign of yt.

In Table 3, we present the correlation matrix for the dependent
variables and all the independent variables. Generally, [the [climate
change variables]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [natural disaster occurrence,
temperature, and precipitation]{.underline} -- [[show **positive
association** with all threatened species]{.underline}]{.mark} except
for mollusks. Similarly, real GDP shows positive association with all
threatened species, while the six governance indicators exhibit negative
association with all the threatened species except for mollusks.
Interestingly, none of the independent variables demonstrates potential
multicollinearity among themselves. The correlation coefficients between
all independent variables are no greater than 0.7. However, as expected,
the governance indicators suggest multicollinearity among the six
governance measures, with association higher than 0.7. Taking this into
consideration, we have estimated all equations for the seven threatened
species by incorporating the six governance indicators one at a time.

Despite similar work on cross-national data analysis, however, unlike
the works of Benhin and Barbier (2004), Shandra (2007), McKinney et al.
(2009), and Shandra et al. (2011, 2016) which have used ordinary least
squares (OLS) to estimate Eq. (1) above, instead in this study, we
follow Asafu-Adjaye (2003) and Barrett et al. (2006) by employing OLS
with robust standard errors, to correct for heteroskedasticity that may
be present in the data. In order to do this, we have estimated Eq. (1)
by using OLS with White's autocorrelation-heteroskedasticity-consistent
standard errors estimator (Newey and West 1987).

The results of our analyses are presented in Table 4 for 2011. Some
explanations are needed here. First, initially all regression equations
are estimated using OLS, and the diagnostics tests such as
Breush-Pagan-Godfrey (BPG), Glejser and White tests for
heteroscedasticity, Ramsey Reset test for misspecification, and
Jarque-Bera test for normality of the residuals are reported in
Table 4 for reference. The diagnostic tests clearly suggest that in some
cases the assumption of OLS was violated. Taking this into
consideration, we have estimated all regressions by employing OLS with
robust standard error due to Newey-West procedure, and these results are
reported in Table 4. And secondly, the estimated regressions presented
in Table 4 are the final estimated models for each threatened species
with different measures of governance indicator. In this study, we have
selected the control of corruption as proxy for governance measure for
birds, mammals, and reptiles; rule of law for amphibians, fishes, and
mollusks; and regulatory quality for plants. Each of this governance
measure was chosen among the six measures based on three model selection
criteria such as the Akaike (AIC), Schwarz (SC), and Hannan-Quinn (HQ)
information criterion. Estimated regression that gives the smallest
value for AIC, SC, and HQ will be chosen as the best fitting model.
Results for OLS and all six governance indicators are available from the
authors upon request.

Our main purpose of conducting this study is to determine the effects of
climate change on biodiversity loss measured by the number of threatened
species. [Climate change was measured by the number of natural disaster
occurrences, temperature, and precipitation]{.underline}. As shown in
Table 4, the adjusted R2 shows that the goodness of fit is satisfactory
for a cross-sectional data analysis for all the estimated models. In
Table 4, [our [estimated regression]{.mark} equations [suggest that
climate change plays an **important role** in]{.mark} contributing to
[the **loss of biodiversity**]{.mark} or the increase in the number of
threatened species for cross-sectional countries]{.underline} in 2011.
Generally, all three climate change indicators -- frequency of natural
disaster occurrences, temperature, and precipitation -- are
statistically significant at least at the 5% significance level. A 1%
increase in the number of frequency in natural disaster events increases
biodiversity loss ranging from 0.24 (mammals and mollusks) to 0.52%
(plants). Among these three measures, it seems that rainfall
(precipitation) has greater impact on biodiversity loss, followed by
temperature and natural disasters. For example, [a 1% increase in
rainfall, on average, increases biodiversity loss for plant species by
2.04%]{.underline} compared to a 1.13% increase in the number of
threatened reptiles as a result in the 1% increase in temperature. Our
results are similar to the work done by Amano et al. (2018) on waterbird
populations in which they found that the impact of precipitation is much
larger than the impact of temperature. On the contrary, Gren et al.
(2016) found that the impact of temperature is much greater than the
impact of precipitation on biodiversity loss using global data.
Nevertheless, our study seems to suggest that the impacts of
precipitation and temperature are more destructive on biodiversity loss
compared to the occurrences of natural disaster events.

On the other hand, real GDP that proxy for the level of economic
development clearly suggests that, on average, an increase in economic
prosperity does not reduce biodiversity loss, thus supporting the
treadmill of production theory. The effects of real GDP on biodiversity
loss are positive and statistically significant at 1% level in all
estimated threatened species equations. In other words, achieving higher
economic growth is at the expense of biodiversity. Higher economic
growth will drive for further economic development, urbanization, energy
consumption, and CO2 emissions. Nonetheless, uncontrolled development
will result in environmental degradation and biodiversity loss as
predicted by the treadmill of production theory. Similar findings were
also found by Barrett et al. (2006), Shandra et al. (2016), Clausen and
York (2008), Naidoo and Adamowicz (2001), McKinney et al. (2009), Gren
et al. (2016), and Rosales (2008). Generally, on average, a 1% increase
in real GDP increases the number of threatened species ranging from 0.19
to 0.32%.

Lastly, our estimated regressions suggest that the relationships between
good governance and biodiversity loss are negative. In other words, on
average, our results suggest that the improvement in governance through
low level of corruption practices and better enforcement of regulatory
quality mitigates biodiversity loss. Our results support the earlier
works by Umemiya et al. (2010), Smith et al. (2003), Culas (2007), Amano
et al. (2018), and Baynham-Herd et al. (2018). The studies by Amano et
al. (2018) and Baynham-Herd et al. (2018) suggest that biodiversity
conservation responses positive to good governance. In our case, by
inspecting the magnitude of the estimated parameters that is their
elasticities, the strongest effects of good governance on biodiversity
loss originate from control of corruption, followed by regulatory
quality. For example, on average, a 10% increase in good governance, for
example, by increasing the control of corruption and the number of
threatened species or biodiversity loss, reduces by 4.5%. Similar impact
can be said for the enforcement of rule of law in mitigating
biodiversity loss. Therefore, regulatory quality and control of
corruption are good policy mix that can be used to mitigate the loss of
biodiversity worldwide.

Robustness checks: further analysis

How robust is our results on the effects of climate change on the number
of threatened species presented above? To check on the robustness of the
positive impact of climate change on biodiversity loss, we have endeavor
to (a) extend our data point 5 years ahead to 2016 and (b) employing
robust regression such as using the M-estimator. The OLS robust results
for using 2016 data are presented in Table 5. Generally, on average, the
results indicate that the three climate change indicators show positive
impact on biodiversity loss. For example, the frequency of natural
disaster occurrences positively impacted the number of threatened
amphibians, birds, plants, and reptiles; temperature affects all
threatened species positively except for the number of threatened
mollusks, while precipitation also increases the number of threatened
amphibians, fishes, plants, and reptiles. Similarly, in support of our
earlier findings, increase in the level of economic development
increases the number of all threatened species -- amphibians, birds,
fishes, mammals, mollusks, plants, and reptiles. On the other hand, our
governance indicator -- the control of corruption and regulatory quality
-- shows that biodiversity loss can be mitigated by good governance
practices.

To our second robustness test, we employ the M-estimator as our robust
regression estimation. In Fig. 2, we demonstrate the boxplots of the
residuals of all estimated regressions presented in Tables 4 and 5. The
boxplots give the overall information about the univariate data (the
residuals) distribution. The core data is plotted as a rectangular box,
while the top and bottom are the lower and the higher quartiles of the
data distribution, respectively. The horizontal line in the box denotes
the data median. The lines above and below the box are called the
whiskers. The whiskers have a length equal to 1.5 times the
interquantile range, and the outliers are the objects located above or
below the whiskers (Daszykowski et al. 2007). As shown in Fig. 2, the
residuals of some of the estimated regressions contain outliers. These
outliers are located at the top and/or bottom of the upper and/or lower
whiskers. These are in the cases of birds, fishes, mammals, plants, and
reptiles.

Barnett and Lewis (1994) have stated that the presence of outliers can
lead to inflated error rates and substantial distortions of parameter
and statistical estimates when using either parametric or non-parametric
tests. Statistically, the increase in error variance will reduce the
power of the statistical tests, decrease normality, and seriously bias
or influence parameter estimates (Perez et al. 2013). According to
Rousseeuw (1984), robust regression is the best method to detect
outliers and provides results that are resistant to the outliers. The
most common general method of robust regression is the M-estimation
method introduced by Huber (1964).

Results of the robust regression estimations using the M-estimators are
given in Table 6 for year 2011 and Table 7 for year 2016. Generally,
results in both tables confirm that climate change has a detrimental
impact on the number of threatened species. For instance, the frequent
occurrences of natural disaster positively affected biodiversity loss,
in particular, the number of threatened amphibians, birds, mammals,
plants, and reptiles. Similarly, rising temperature will increase the
number of threatened of all species except for mollusks. On the other
hand, increase in precipitation will also increase biodiversity loss.
For year 2011, precipitation affects positively on the number of
threatened amphibians, fishes, plants, and reptiles, while results for
data 2016 indicate that increase in precipitation will increase the
number of threatened of all species except for mollusks.

Consistent with our earlier results, the impact of an increase in
economic development has adverse effects on biodiversity. Results in
both Tables 6 and 7 clearly indicate that striving for economic growth
inevitably will result in biodiversity loss. Lastly, our robust
regression results suggest that good governance do mitigate biodiversity
loss. The results show that the control of corruption, enforcement of
regulatory quality, and rule of law can restrict activities that are
detrimental to biodiversity.

Conclusion

In this study, [we have estimated the impact of climate change on
biodiversity loss.]{.underline} Using a cross-national sample of 115
countries, [we are able to determine that climate change -- the
occurrences of natural disaster events, temperature, and precipitation,
play important role in affecting biodiversity loss.]{.underline} [Our
study suggests that the impact on biodiversity loss is more affected by
the changes in precipitation and temperature]{.underline} than the
changes in the frequency of the natural disaster events. Nevertheless,
all these effects point to global warming, in which it was the result
when nations strive for higher economic growth. In this sense, Rosales
(2008) was right to infer that "economic growth is the main driver of
climate change-related biodiversity loss".

In this study, we also found that the level of economic development
contributes in the loss of biodiversity. [Thus, for effective
biodiversity conservation, a [nation should]{.mark} use their wealth and
effort to [reduce the amount of carbon dioxide emissions]{.mark} in
order to combat global warming and natural disaster
mishaps.]{.underline} The government and the industry players including
the financial sector should be held responsible for the loss in
biodiversity. Their activities in pursuing the ultimate goal of
prosperity and profits are at the expense of biodiversity which, on the
other hand, is very important to support life on Earth. Nevertheless,
effective conservation efforts without the control of corruption and
enforcement of rule of law will not do much help in mitigating the loss
of biodiversity.

The impact of global warming on biodiversity extinction

[Extinction is a hotly debated, but poorly understood topic in
science]{.underline}. The same goes for climate change. When scientists
try to forecast the impact of global change on future biodiversity
levels, the results are contentious, to say the least.

While some argue that species have managed to survive worse climate
change in the past and that current threats to biodiversity are
overstated, many biologists say the impacts of climate change and
resulting shifts in rainfall, temperature, sea levels, ecosystem
composition, and food availability will have significant effects on
global species richness.

[Lessons from historic extinctions]{.underline}

[There is [little doubt]{.mark} that [climate]{.mark} has
[played]{.mark} a [critical role in]{.mark} past [fluctuations of
biod]{.mark}iversity levels. [Among]{.mark} the [**five**
recognized]{.mark} **[mass extinction events]{.mark}** --- the
Ordovician, the Devonian, the Permian, the Triassic and the Cretaceous
--- **[at least four]{.mark}** are believed to [have]{.mark} some
[correlation to climate]{.mark} change.]{.underline}

Peter Ward, a paleontologist at the University of Washington in Seattle,
says [there is evidence that **[most mass extinctions]{.mark}** were
[caused by **gradual**]{.mark} **[c]{.mark}**limate **[c]{.mark}**hange.
[Specifically]{.mark} he cites [the **Triassic and Permian
extinctions**]{.mark} of 200 million and 251 million years ago,
respectively.]{.underline}

"The Triassic event isn't something that happened overnight," said Ward,
noting that [carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere then were up to
**100 times** what they are today.]{.underline}

In the case of the Permian, [rising temperatures may have caused the
greatest mass extinction on record]{.underline}, according to a study
published in the September 2005 issue of Geology. [[Global
warming]{.underline}]{.mark}, which may have produced temperatures 10 to
30 degrees Celsius (18-54 degrees F) higher than today, [is believed to
have [wiped out 95%]{.mark} of [life]{.mark} forms [in]{.mark} the
world's [oceans]{.mark} [and almost **75% of terrestrial
species**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

While climate change has caused species extinction, it has also led to
the birth of new species, including mankind.

[[During]{.mark} the]{.underline} Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum
([[PETM]{.mark}), a period]{.underline} 55 million years ago [[marked
by]{.mark} a [rapid rise in g]{.mark}reen[h]{.mark}ouse
[g]{.mark}ase[s]{.mark} that heated Earth by roughly 9° F (5° C) in less
than 10,000 years]{.underline}, [climate [warming
caused]{.mark}]{.underline} widespread changes, including [[mass
extinction in]{.mark} the world's [oceans from acidification and shifts
of plant]{.mark} communitie[s due to]{.mark} [changes in
rainfall]{.mark}]{.underline}. The era helped set the stage for the "Age
of Mammals," which included the first appearance of modern primates.

Later periods of climate change in Africa may have created conditions
that lef to the evolution of humans. Dr Mark Maslin, Senior Lecturer in
Geography at University College London, agues that climate variation
over the last 2.7 million years played a crucial part in enhancing human
development. His work suggests that humans evolved during short periods
of great environmental change --- when dry periods were punctuated by
large rapidly appearing and disappearing lakes. It was these rapid
changes in water sources that forced primitive hominid communities to
rapidly change and adapt

"These temporary humid periods would have imposed huge impacts on early
humans," he stated at the 2005 Annual Conference of the Royal
Geographical Society in London. "Our research provides strong support
for theories in which early human species evolved and spread out in
response to a rapidly changing environment."

[[Climate]{.mark} change-induced extinction **[breeds
biod]{.mark}iversity**, but with a delay]{.underline}

Despite past extinctions, on a geological time scale Earth presently has
more species than ever before. However, it is important to note that
while climate change has given rise to new species following mass
extinction, the [**[recovery time]{.mark}** is [measured in]{.mark} the
**[millions of years]{.mark}**, whereas [humans]{.mark} have [only been
around for less than 200,000]{.mark} years. Past extinction teaches us
that biodiversity takes a long time to recover and species loss in
coming years will not be replaced on any meaningful time
scale.]{.underline}

Most biologists agree that [[we are]{.mark} presently [in]{.mark} the
[midst of]{.mark} a [sixth great extinction event]{.mark}, one [where
**species loss** is **outpacing**]{.mark} species
**[birth]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In a paper published last year in the
Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics, Camille Parmesan,
a biologist from the University of Texas at Austin, argued that current
global warming has already caused extinctions in the world's most
sensitive habitats and will continue to cause more species to go extinct
over the next 50 to 100 years. Parmesan's work shows that while some
species---especially those with short generation times like
insects---are evolving in response to climate change, they are not
evolving in ways that could prevent extinction. [Overall species
evolution is not making up for species disappearance.]{.underline}

Current extinctions

To date, the most comprehensive forecast for the impact of climate
change on global biodiversity was made in two 2004 papers published in
Nature by Chris Thomas and colleagues. Analyzing the distributions of
1103 species of animals and plants from various parts of the world, the
authors showed that 15-37 percent are likely to go extinct based on the
best projections of future climate change.

"We matched up the current geographical distribution of each of these
1103 species with the climatic conditions in these areas, and then asked
"[how large an area of this type of climate will exist **[in
2050]{.mark}**, and where might it be]{.underline}?" Dr. Thomas, a
biologist from the University of York, explained to mongabay.com via
email. "[[In many cases]{.mark}, the **[climate]{.mark}** currently
[occupied by a species]{.mark} was **[expected to disappear
entirely]{.mark}**; [in other cases]{.mark}, there was [no
geographic]{.mark} [overlap]{.mark} [between where]{.mark} the [species
currently occurs and where]{.mark} the climatic [conditions]{.mark} will
[remain suitable]{.mark} -- the species would have to move or
potentially face extinction."]{.underline}

Dr. Thomas says that the uncertainty association with climate change
projections make biodiversity estimates tricky, but that their
[projections suggest that [climate change could rival]{.mark}
[human]{.mark}-caused [habitat loss as]{.mark} the [**leading driver**
of]{.mark} species [extinction]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"Using a variety of climate scenarios, assumptions and methods of
analysis, we estimated that somewhere between 5% and 50% of the species
we analyzed are at risk of extinction, with the central range of
estimates falling between 15% and 37%. [This is on the basis of warming
projected until 2050, so the year 2100 risks of extinction from climate
change are likely to lie in the upper half of this range (or
above),"]{.underline} he explained. "[Our estimates of potential
extinction were preliminary values intended to define the order of
magnitude of the problem. We found that the extinction risks from
climate change are probably similar to those from habitat loss, and
conceivably even greater in some regions.]{.underline}"

Dr. Thomas cautions that not all the species "committed to extinction"
will disappear by 2050 due to the inherent lag time of extinction.

"When the climate becomes unsuitable for the long-term survival of a
species, it does not mean that it will die out immediately. For species
with long-lived individuals, in particular, it may be many decades or
even centuries before the last individuals die out. So, these are the
numbers of species that may be declining towards extinction from 2050
onwards, not the numbers that will have died out by that date."

How does climate change affect biodiversity?

[[Climate change]{.mark} can [affect species in **myriad
ways**]{.mark}]{.underline} including the [[expansion,
contraction]{.mark}, and "[migration" of habitat]{.mark}]{.underline};
[[increased]{.mark} incidence of [disease]{.mark} and [invasive
species]{.mark}; [changes in]{.mark} temperature, precipitation, and
other [environmental conditions]{.mark}; [shifts in food
availability]{.mark}; and [failure of eco]{.mark}logical [relationships
with other species]{.mark}]{.underline} --- for example the loss of
critical pollinators or mutualistic nutrient fixers. In the past some
species may have escaped extinction by "migrating" north or southward in
response to climate change. [Today [humans]{.mark} have [made]{.mark} it
a lot [tougher]{.mark} [by]{.mark} fragmenting, converting, and
[destroying habitats]{.mark} and potential migration
corridors.]{.underline}

Peter Raven, director of the Missouri Botanical Garden and a renowned
expert on biodiversity, says that climate change will also make
conservation efforts more difficult.

"As the climate changes, [[protected areas]{.mark} will [not]{.mark} be
[able to shift due to]{.mark} surrounding [urban]{.mark} areas [and
ag]{.mark}ricultural [zones]{.mark}]{.underline}," he told mongabay.com
via telephone. "This makes them all the more susceptible to the impact
of climate change, whether it is rising sea levels, a dip in
precipitation levels, or warmer temperatures."

"Habitat loss will interact with climate change too," added Dr. Thomas.
"It is hard enough to conserve enough land to protect the world's
biodiversity if it stays still -- how much harder if it is moving
around, as species shift their distributions into new areas where the
climate becomes suitable for them. One needs to protect where species
are now, where they will have to get to in future, and land in between
that they must traverse on the way. Thus, the first response to maintain
biodiversity in the context of climate change is to renew efforts to
protect large areas of natural and semi-natural habitats, particularly
in mountain ranges and other environmentally diverse regions -- where
species may be able to survive by moving relatively short distances from
lower to higher elevations, from drier to moister soils (and vice
versa), and so on."

If so many species are expected to die out, then where are all the
extinctions?

Earth's biodiversity is still poorly known. Dr. Raven estimates that
less than one-sixth of species have even been named, let alone assessed
for their risk to climate change. As such, most extinction will occur
among species that are small and poorly known. Further, species
extinction is expected to accelerate significantly around mid-century
should climate forecasts prove accurate, says Dr. Thomas.

"[We expect to see most extinction occurring from 2050 onwards, not
yet,"]{.underline} he said. "But there is increasing evidence that
species are declining at the low altitude and low latitude edges of
their geographic ranges. And last year, Alan Pounds and colleagues
published a paper indicating that over 1% of all of the world's
amphibian species (the harlequin frogs) have succumbed to
climate-triggered outbreaks of a fungal skin pathogen. This is both
sooner that I expected, and worse than I feared."

Dr. Thomas is referring to the study which found that [almost two-thirds
of the 110 known [harlequin]{.mark} Atelopus [frog species]{.mark} of
Central and South America [went extinct in]{.mark} the 1980s and
19[90s]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The [leading culprit]{.mark} for the
demise [was]{.mark} a type of [chytrid fungus]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis), an infectious skin disease. The
[researchers discovered strong correlations between **changes in
climate** and the last known sightings of the frogs]{.underline}.
According to the scientists, the Earth's rising temperatures enhance
cloud cover on tropical mountains, leading to cooler days and warmer
nights, both of which favor the chytrid fungus which grows and
reproduces best at temperatures between 63 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit (17
to 25 degrees Celsius).

"The [harlequin frog extinctions represent an important
reminder]{.underline}. None of the threats affecting the world's
biodiversity act in isolation. [[C]{.mark}limate [c]{.mark}hange [helped
**trigger**]{.mark} **[epidemics]{.mark}** of an emerging disease, and
it was the **[combined forces]{.mark}** of these two threats that [was
so damaging]{.mark} to the harlequin frogs."]{.underline}

These brightly colored frogs may just be the proverbial "canary in the
coal mine": an increasing number of studies suggest that climate change
could well put a wide variety of plants and animals at risk of
extinction.

Beyond frogs: lemurs, birds, and coral reefs

[Patricia Wright, one of the world's foremost lemur experts, found that
even [small shifts in rainfall]{.mark} patterns can [drastically affect
lemur population]{.mark}. "A slight change in climate, even in the
rainforest where we assume there is plenty of water, can impact infant
survival for lemurs,"]{.underline} she said following the publication of
a PNAS paper in 2005 that showed how even subtle changes in climate
directly result in lower reproductive success in lemurs. "[I was shocked
to see the effect of rainfall decreases of such small magnitude on the
survival of infant sifakas. The [implications]{.mark} are [huge in a
world **full** of **endangered species**]{.mark}." She says that
deforestation and habitat fragmentation will only worsen the
threat.]{.underline}

Similarly, [climate modeling of the tropical forests of Northern [South
America]{.mark}]{.underline}, Dr. Paul A. T. Higgins [[expect]{.mark}s a
regional [decline in biod]{.mark}iversity [due to low]{.mark}er levels
of [rainfall]{.mark}. He says [habitat destruction]{.mark} will
[make]{.mark} it [more difficult]{.mark} for species to persist in
shifting forests.]{.underline}

Meanwhile, research on birds indicated that up to 72 percent of bird
species in northeastern Australia and more than a third in Europe could
go extinct due to global warming. The WWF report, which reviewed more
than 200 scientific articles on birds found that species most at risk
included migratory, mountain, island, wetland, Arctic, Antarctic and
seabirds. Last year, Britain's environmental protection agency (DEFRA)
warned that climate change will disrupt breeding, hamper migrations, and
increase disease transmission in migratory birds and animals.

Finally, a series of studies published over the past few years have
expressed dire concern for coral reefs[. Among the most alarming was one
by WWF and the Queensland government that said [Australia's Great
Barrier Reef]{.mark} could [lose **95 percent** of]{.mark} its [**living
coral** by **2050**]{.mark} [should ocean temp]{.mark}eratures [increase
by]{.mark} the **[1.5 degrees]{.mark}** Celsius [**projected**
by]{.mark} climate [scientists]{.mark}. [Ocean acidification]{.mark},
resulting from higher concentrations of dissolved carbon dioxide, [is a
further threat to]{.mark} corals and plankton that form the basis of
[the marine food chain]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Climate change is an undeniable reality that is dramatically shaping our
world today. Its impacts are profound, from rising temperatures and
melting ice caps to extreme weather. But its consequences are not
limited to humans alone. It also has far-reaching effects on the world's
biodiversity. This is often overlooked, yet it is interlinked.

[[In]{.mark} just over [40 years]{.mark}, [wildlife]{.mark} populations
[show]{.mark}ed a [dramatic **decline of 69%**]{.mark} on average. The
[IPCC reports]{.mark} that around 20-**[30%]{.mark}** of [**species

average]{.mark} surface temperature has [risen by]{.mark} roughly [1
degree]{.mark} Celsius]{.underline}. The data speaks for itself,
painting a clear picture of the current state of biodiversity and
climate change.

\<\<PARAGRAPH CONDENSED\>\>

The effects of climate change on biodiversity Biodiversity, or the
'diversity of life' on Earth, is essential for the planet's health and
survival. But the effects of climate change are becoming increasingly
clear. Extreme weather events are happening more often. The timing of
biological events is changing. Our wildlife is disappearing. But its
impacts are not felt the same across the planet, as some regions and
species are more at risk than others. Climate change is having a greater
impact on the poles, tropical rainforests, and coastal areas than
anywhere else in the world. This could have far-reaching consequences
for the planet's health; and our future. Rising global temperatures
leads to habitat loss on land and sea Rising global temperatures, also
known as 'global warming', is one of the most important aspects of
climate change. It refers to the increasing greenhouse gases, like CO2
and methane, in the atmosphere, which trap the sun's heat. This trapped
heat is related---directly or indirectly---to widespread habitat loss on
both land and in the sea. On the surface, polar ice caps and glaciers
are melting. This is causing sea levels to rise and encroach on coastal
habitats and the Arctic tundra. Not only this, but global rainfall
patterns are being affected as well. The changes in weather patterns can
lead to extreme environmental changes, like 'desertification'. This is
when wild habitats like grasslands or shrublands slowly turn into
deserts. In the oceans, CO2 concentrations are now higher than they have
been in the past 800,000 years. As a result, our seas are getting
warmer, and the oceans are becoming more acidic. These conditions are
known to cause mass coral bleaching. To date, scientists have identified
six coral bleaching events since 1998, most notably on the Great Barrier
Reef. This is of concern since coral reefs are one of the most
biodiverse and valuable ecosystems on Earth.

\<\<PARAGRAPH INTEGRITY RESUMES\>\>

Changing weather patterns disrupt seasonal lifecycles and events

[[C]{.mark}limate [c]{.mark}hange also affects biodiversity by
**[disturb]{.mark}ing** the timing of **[natural cycles]{.mark}** and
events. [Frequent changes in weather]{.mark} patterns, such as early
springs or warm winters, can [disrupt]{.mark} the natural [rhythm of
life]{.mark}. [Animals]{.mark} often [take cues]{.mark} from their
environment [when]{.mark} making important decisions, like when to
[migrate or]{.mark} when to [reproduce]{.mark}. So any big changes in
weather patterns can mean biological events fall out of sync and happen
at different times. For example, [birds arriving at breeding]{.mark}
[grounds when]{.mark} the [food]{.mark} source [is scarce]{.mark}r.
[This]{.mark} can [**threaten their survival** as well as]{.mark} their
[breeding]{.mark} efforts.]{.underline}

[[Climate]{.mark} breakdown can also lead to an
**[unpredictable]{.mark}** outcome [for]{.mark} the functioning of
**[entire ecosystems]{.mark}**. In almost all cases, biodiversity
declines despite a 'degree of redundancy', such as a species being
replaced by another. For example, the number of [North American monarch
butterflies]{.mark} has been [shrinking]{.mark} over the years. And this
decline has been [linked to c]{.mark}limate
[c]{.mark}hange.]{.underline}

Extreme weather and frequent weather-related disasters harms wildlife

[[C]{.mark}limate [c]{.mark}hange is [causing extreme weather]{.mark}
like storms, floods and wildfires [to happen more often and]{.mark} be
**[more severe]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Such tragic events not only
affect humans, but they also destroy habitats and kill wildlife. As an
example, [[the 20]{.mark}19-[20 Australian bushfires burned]{.mark}
almost [19 million hectares of land]{.mark}. It also [affected]{.mark}
nearly **[three billion animals]{.mark}**, including koalas, wombats,
kangaroos and wallabies.]{.underline} Besides, they can have long-term
effects on the remaining survivors and even us, humans.

We can also see the effects of [**weather-related** disasters on
biodiversity in the UK]{.underline}. According to the National Trust,
the extreme weather [in 2022]{.underline} was very bad for UK wildlife.
[[Dried-up rivers]{.mark} and streams affected wild populations of
natterjack toads in northwest England]{.underline}. [The [shorter
flowering season]{.mark} also [meant **less food**]{.mark} for insects
and birds, such as bumblebees, butterflies and redwings.]{.underline}

Climate change creates pathways for the introduction and spread of
invasive species

[The [geographic ranges]{.mark} of many animal and plant species have
been **[shifting]{.mark} from low to high** [latitudes in response to
c]{.mark}limate [c]{.mark}hange. This can [create]{.mark} new [pathways
for invasive species]{.mark} that are not native to a particular area.
And often, they are introduced by human activity.]{.underline}

When the climate changes, [invasive species]{.underline} can move into
new habitats and [[compete with native species]{.mark} for food, shelter
and space]{.underline}. [They]{.underline} can [[also introduce new
diseases]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, [[red squirrel]{.mark}s used
to be a common]{.underline} sight [in the UK---the **only native**
squirrel **species**]{.underline}. But their [[population]{.mark} has
been [declining]{.mark}]{.underline} for many years
[[since]{.underline}]{.mark} the introduction of grey squirrels from
North America in the 1800s.

The larger [[grey squirrels]{.underline}]{.mark} are much better at
adapting to changing conditions than the smaller red squirrels. [They
are also known to [carry]{.mark} the '[**squirrelpox**']{.mark}
virus]{.underline}. [[Grey squirrels]{.mark} are [immune]{.mark} to this
disease, [but it kills]{.mark} the [red squirrels]{.mark}]{.underline}.
This causes population decline. Red squirrels are now only found in
Scotland, parts of northern England and Wales, and small islands near
England's southern coast.

It leads to an increase in human-wildlife conflict

Climate change also contributes to human-wildlife conflict. As wild
habitats shrink and food sources become scarce, animals are forced to
move closer and closer to human settlements. This leads to increased
interactions between humans and wildlife, often resulting in harm to
both parties. From the loss of crops and livestock to the loss of human
lives and animals involved. Besides, there is also the risk of disease
transmission in both animals and humans.

Human-wildlife conflict is an upcoming global issue. It poses a
significant challenge for biodiversity conservation, as well as for our
health and well-being.

It contributes to wildlife decline and extinction of species

[The extinction of species is perhaps the most worrying effect of
climate change on biodiversity. The most at-risk are those with
**limited climate ranges**, like polar bears and arctic
foxes]{.underline}. It is [also]{.underline} the case for [animals with
restricted habitats and small, isolated populations]{.underline}.
[Galapagos giant tortoises and marine iguanas are a few good
examples.]{.underline}

Our current estimates suggest that [wildlife populations have declined
by an average of 69% since 1970]{.underline}. And [[species]{.mark} are
[**disappearing** between 1,000 and **10,000 times** higher]{.mark}
[than what is natural]{.mark}.]{.underline} Other human activities, such
as deforestation and overfishing, are also cause for concern. The loss
of species not only reduces biodiversity, but it also indicates that the
ecosystem is breaking down. If we continue as usual, there is a risk of
global system failure unless we take urgent action. For example, if we
lose bees, we may lose all the plants that they pollinate. This will
then affect all the animals that eat those plants, including humans. A
world without bees could mean a rise in global food insecurity unless we
take urgent action.

#### Seafloor mineral collection is [necessary]{.underline} and [ecologically sustainable]{.underline}.

In pure quantitative resource terms, deep-sea metals are thus optional
for net-zero pathways. [But [given how society]{.mark} is presently
[grappling with]{.mark} how to best [expand and diversify
battery]{.mark} metal [production]{.mark} today, the [insistence that
ocean]{.mark} resources ~~are~~ [\[is\] off-limits]{.mark} [risks ruling
out]{.mark} a [**promising approach** for accomplishing this]{.mark}
**more [efficiently and sustainably]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Table 1: Comparison of seafloor nodule and land-based resources for the
chief metals contained in polymetallic nodules, contrasted against
requirements for large-scale electric vehicle deployment.

\<\<Table Omitted\>\>

In response, activists challenge the very idea that society requires any
significant new mining at all, often by calling instead for improved
recycling and a crusade against private automobile ownership. This
car-hating recycling-based circular economy platform rather elegantly
upholds traditional conservationist principles while dodging most
acknowledgement that the global shift towards more sustainable societies
might involve ecological tradeoffs. However, it is both incoherent and
incorrect. Specific [[proposals for reducing car ownership]{.mark} are
often **[unrealistic]{.mark}ally overoptimistic**, while cold, hard
[math suggests]{.mark} that [even]{.mark} a [vastly smaller global car
fleet]{.mark} would [still require]{.mark} [electric vehicle
replacements]{.mark} on the order of [at least **several hundred
million** electric cars]{.mark}, relative to the 30 million or so that
exist today. The quantitative [case for]{.mark} new [battery metal
mining is unshakeable]{.mark}.]{.underline}

As such, [climate hawks would do well to consider the environmental case
for deep-sea metals. [One]{.mark} particular [advantage is
adaptive]{.mark} [management]{.mark}. [Unlike]{.mark} a [surface
mine]{.mark} on land, [where]{.mark} many significant [ecological
impacts occur]{.mark} all [at once]{.mark} during the mine's initial
construction, the [fingerprint of nodule collection]{.mark} on the
seafloor [is **incremental** with]{.mark} every unit of [rocks
collected]{.mark}]{.underline}. [If scientists conclude that it is
important for collector vehicles to leave more nodules behind,
[operators can **adjust accordingly**]{.mark} even [**midway**
through]{.mark} [harvesting]{.mark} an area.]{.underline} If regulators
determine that underwater noise from nodule collection is more harmful
than anticipated, they can require technology improvements that reduce
impacts from that point forward. If collector vehicle technology
improves in ways that further minimize environmental risks, regulators
can compel all operators to adopt that technology.

At the most basic level, [we can imagine [forms of seafloor nodule
collection]{.mark} that **[tread extremely lightly]{.mark}** upon the
seafloor]{.underline}. Regulators are working with scientists and
aspiring operators to define initial precautionary thresholds for
dissolved metals, noise, light, and turbidity that nodule collectors
will in turn commit to meet. Across the conceivable spectrum of
approaches one can envision robots that only disturb sediment to half
the depth, that use dimmer onboard lights, or that eject sediment in a
controlled manner to greatly reduce the size of the plume in their wake.
[Advocacy by many opponents for seafloor mining bans that would
foreclose any of these possibilities hints at a **narrow-minded
aversion** that fixates more on the idea of collecting seabed metals
than it does on the actual impacts.]{.underline}

#### DSM is better environmentally and economically than land mining

[[Mining for **rare earths in the deep-seabed** has **economic and
environmental advantages over land mining**.]{.mark}
Some [research]{.mark} has [suggested]{.mark} that [deep-sea
mining]{.mark} [will be cheaper than land]{.mark} mining and yield
higher profits. [Also, the]{.mark} seafloor [deposits]{.mark}
[are]{.mark} much [more concentrated]{.mark} than those on land [and
would]{.mark} therefore [take less processing to extract the minerals,
which is the most environmentally destructive part]{.mark} of mining.
New technology has also reduced the environmental risk of deep-sea
mining. More than one metal can be obtained at one deep-sea site. [Land
mines leave a substantial footprint but d]{.mark}eep-[s]{.mark}ea
[m]{.mark}ines [have no roads, surface ore-transport systems, or other
infrastructures.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Jay Timmons, President and CEO of the National Association of
Manufacturers, explained the importance of domestic access to rare
earths in his testimony to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations
supporting LOTS: "[**Without**]{.mark} those [**rare earth materials**,
**manufacturing**]{.mark} simply **[will not be able to
compete]{.mark}** and succeed [in the world marketplace]{.mark}... The
bottom line is if we can't access rare earth materials on the floor of
the sea, we're going to be put at a significant competitive
disadvantage."]{.underline}

The Senate has an opportunity to help jump-start the US rare earth
minerals market and create jobs in a way that is more environmentally
friendly than the House legislation. Plus, there are many, many more
advantages that would be afforded to the US economy and national
security through ratification of the treaty besides deep-sea mining.

### 2AC\-\--China Alt Cause

#### China is bad for ecosystems -- no regard for environment.

China's dominance in mineral markets also is a central driver of its
undersea ambitions, particularly in the South China Sea and across the
broader Pacific. [As resource demands surge, [Beijing]{.mark} is
[accelerating]{.mark} its [search for new sources to reinforce]{.mark}
its near-[monopoly]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the South China Sea, the
[convergence of strategic ambition and resource hunger is **[driving
increasingly aggressive behavior]{.mark}**---from the [militarization of
artificial islands to]{.mark} routine [harassment of]{.mark}
[neighboring]{.mark} vessels---[aimed at cementing control over]{.mark}
resource-rich [seabeds]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Beijing's domestic mining operations have [long been [associated with
widespread environmental destruction]{.mark}]{.underline}. China has
similarly shown a [[disregard for global norms]{.mark}, such as
Beijing's distant [water fishing fleet that damages fragile ecosystems
through]{.mark} illegal, unreported, and unregulated ([IUU]{.mark})
[fishing]{.mark}]{.underline}. The government has shown [[little
appetite for reform]{.mark}, suggesting that **[China]{.mark}** is
**[unlikely to approach deep-sea mineral extraction with]{.mark}** any
greater **[regard for the environment or welfare of neighboring
nations]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

#### Other countries are mining now in their continental shelves

[[**Several countries have taken steps to mine for seabed minerals** on
their continental shelves. For example]{.mark}, the [Cook Islands,
India, Japan, and Norway]{.mark} have passed domestic laws related to
seabed mining activities in their national waters, invested in the
exploration of their continental shelves for marine minerals, and/or
developed technology for the purpose of commercial
recovery]{.underline}.

The Cook Islands Seabed Mineral Authority estimates that 6.7 billion
metric tons of polymetallic nodules---potato-shaped rocks lying on the
deep seafloor that may contain cobalt, copper, manganese, nickel, and
rare earth elements (REEs)---occur on the country\'s continental shelf.
The Cook Islands Seabed Minerals Authority estimates these nodules
contain 20 million metric tons of cobalt. In 2022, the Authority issued
three five-year licenses to explore for polymetallic nodules on the Cook
Islands continental shelf. As of April 25, 2025, the Cook Islands
government has allowed only for exploration of its seabed for
polymetallic nodules, not resource extraction. For more information
about seabed mining in the Pacific Islands region, see CRS In Focus
IF12974, *Seabed Mining Interests Across the Pacific Islands*, by
Caitlin Keating-Bitonti and Jared G. Tupuola.

[India\'s domestic legislation for offshore seabed mining, the Offshore
Areas Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, was amended in 2023 to
include an auction method for allocating operating rights within Indian
waters.]{.underline} In November 2024, the Ministry of Mines identified
13 offshore mineral blocks for auction in three regions across India\'s
continental shelf. [Seven of these blocks, all located off Great Nicobar
Island in the eastern Indian Ocean, will be auctioned for polymetallic
nodules and crusts, which are expected to contain cobalt, iron, lead
manganese, nickel, and REEs.]{.underline} Some opponents of seabed
mining have reported that the Geological Survey of India conducted
limited observational studies off Great Nicobar Island.

In 2010, Japan experienced REE supply disruptions from China, which
controls more than 70% of the global market share in REEs. Japan has
since explored its continental shelf for seabed mineral deposits, in
accordance with a domestic 2007 ocean policy law. In 2017, a Japanese
government-owned mining company reportedly mined zinc and other minerals
from an inactive hydrothermal vent on Japan\'s continental shelf.
[[Japan\'s government also has invested in]{.mark} pumping [machinery to
extract deep-sea muds for REEs;]{.mark} researchers estimate these muds
could meet annual global demands for some REEs, such as yttrium,
europium, terbium, and dysprosium, for 30-60 years. Some [experts
speculate that seabed mining within Japan\'s]{.mark} national [waters
could shift it]{.mark} from being import dependent [to being a mineral
resources-producing country]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

In 2008, Norwegian geologists discovered a hydrothermal vent system
located on Norway\'s continental shelf that occurs along the Arctic
Mid-Ocean Ridge. Some geologists have speculated that economic
quantities of minerals (e.g., copper, zinc) occur in the deposits
surrounding the vent system. On January 9, 2024, the Norwegian
Parliament opened an area of its continental shelf for commercial-scale
mining activities. Following the Norwegian Parliament\'s decision, the
European Parliament passed a resolution expressing its concerns about
Norway opening an area of its continental shelf for mining. On December
1, 2024, Norway\'s Socialist Left Party blocked the government\'s plans
to offer the country\'s first deep-sea mining exploration permits in
early 2025 due to environmental concerns. Norway\'s Ministry of Energy
plans to hold the first licensing round in 2026, according to reporting.

[Or there's the case of exaggerated claims about the future of tuna. [A

[label]{.mark} [nodule collection as]{.mark} a [**threat** to Pacific

it once again appears that nobody has read the underlying paper. [The

### Greenpeace Indict

#### Greenpeace bad and is false

Noel **Yaxley**, 20**21** -- Writer and researcher who regularly writes
publications. "We need to talk about Greenpeace," The Critic,
https://thecritic.co.uk/talk-greenpeace/.

Since the group re-emerged after a long hiatus in the wilderness ---
probably busy making hair shirts or shouting at petrol --- [they]{.mark}
[have tried]{.mark} every means at their disposal [to raise
awareness]{.mark} [that we are living in a supposed climate
emergency]{.mark}. [Their hapless]{.mark} Dad's Army [approach]{.mark}
to environmental activism managed to [[enrage]{.mark} and frustrate just
about [every sector of]{.mark} British [society]{.mark}]{.underline}.
From a blockade that obstructed newspaper printing presses to disrupting
the travel plans of millions of fed up commuters, the [group]{.mark}
managed to [alienate]{.mark} just about [anyone]{.mark} who may have
been receptive to their cause. [**[Hyperbolic statements]{.underline}**
didn't help]{.mark} either. [Founding]{.mark} member Roger Hallam
[[claimed "billions"]{.mark} will [die]{.mark}]{.underline} if we fail
to take immediate action. Rather [than]{.mark} bring people with them,
these **[[ridiculous stunts and statements]{.underline}]{.mark}** have
had the opposite effect.

Although Extinction Rebellion are the current torch bearers of
performative activism, the progenitors of contemporary environmental
virtue signalling are Greenpeace but it wasn't always this way.
Originally called "Don't Make a Wave Committee" the group was formed
fifty years ago in Vancouver, Canada with two clear goals --- the
protection of whales and the wholesale elimination of all nuclear
testing. In order to draw attention to the United States' testing of
nuclear weapons in the North Pacific, the group, headed by co-founder
Bob Hunter, chartered a vessel and headed towards the test site.
Although bad weather caused the ship to turn back, the stunt drew a lot
of attention. In 1971 they decided to rebrand, taking the name from the
fishing boat used in the protest --- "The Greenpeace".

[[They]{.mark} [adopt]{.mark} a [Malthusian mindset which **falsely
attributes over-population as**]{.mark} **the [primary cause of climate
change]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

It didn't take long for the group to be subverted. The long march
through the green institution was more of a sprint. [Greenpeace]{.mark}
was being **[[hijacked by radicals]{.underline}]{.mark}** [as early
as]{.mark} the mid [80's]{.mark}. Just ask Patrick Moore. Moore,
[an]{.mark} [original member]{.mark} of Greenpeace left the organisation
in 1986 saying " \[they\] took a sharp turn to the political left,"
[argu]{.mark}ing that [it had "evolved into]{.mark} an organisation of
[extremism and politically motivated agendas]{.mark}."

They are now active in over 50 countries. Boasting a worldwide annual
revenue of \$368 million dollars, they have become one of the most
powerful environmental organisations in the world. They quickly evolved
from a relatively obscure tranche of concerned environmentalists into a
monolithic ecological organisation [[advocat]{.mark}ing [more and more
**dangerous and ill-conceived** forms of direct
action]{.mark}]{.underline}. One infamous stunt involved draping a
banner over the 1,500 year old Nazca lines in Peru --- damaging the
earth around the U.N World Heritage site --- an act of cultural
desecration.

Greenpeace's current campaign takes aim at the growing problem of
plastic pollution. In a recently released video piles of plastic
detritus can be seen raining down on a computer generated Boris Johnson.
The amount of plastic seen in the clip is supposed to represent what we
export on an average day to developing countries. Whilst certainly a
problem --- exports of plastic waste reached 537,000 tonnes last year
--- Greenpeace are at least in part responsible for this voluminous
amount of rubbish.

The group has spent twenty years opposed to the building of waste
plants, otherwise known as incinerators. These plants dispose of rubbish
by burning waste material. Citing the potentially lethal by-products of
this industrial process --- dioxins --- Greenpeace Toxics campaigner
Mark Strutt has labelled the building of incinerators "dangerous and
irresponsible."

Whilst Strutt is correct --- incinerators do indeed produce dioxins ---
they are relatively small compared to other emission sources. In 2017
the annual dioxin emissions from waste plants was ten times lower than
that emitted from a single night of Bonfire celebrations on or around
November 5th.

An activist [organisation taking]{.mark} a [stand]{.mark}
[against]{.mark} [something]{.mark} [likely to improve our lives]{.mark}
is hardly news. But when this opposition [has]{.mark} potentially
**[[life-threatening ramifications]{.underline}]{.mark}**, it needs to
be addressed.

Golden Rice is the result of nine years of research. It is a form of
rice that has been genetically modified. It's an example of
bio-fortification --- a process whereby a crop is modified in order to
improve its nutritional value. The gold colour comes from beta carotene
--- a substance that converts into vitamin A in the body. Whilst
relatively unknown in the west, vitamin A deficiency is a life or death
issue in the developing world. According to Johns Hopkins, a lack of
this essential vitamin is responsible for an annual worldwide death toll
of as many as 3 million children. Those that don't suffer a slow painful
death through chronic malnutrition are left permanently blind. Golden
rice could help eradicate this deficiency in countries where the
condition is endemic.

The organisation is well known for its hostility to genetically modified
organisms (GMOs). So much so that 100 Nobel laureates signed an open
letter to the group calling for them to end their anti GMO campaign.
Their opposition has been persistent and strident. [Falsely
calling]{.mark} the rice a "[hoax]{.mark}" -claiming the funding for its
scientific research has diverted money away from the real problem ---
global poverty. According to Ed Regis, author of Golden Rice, "The rice
\[had\] been subjected to safety studies -toxicity and allergenicity
studies --- and studies on human consumption, including among American
adults and Chinese children. These have found it to be more effective in
providing vitamin A than spinach and almost as effective as pure beta
carotene oil itself."

[Both Extinction Rebellion and Greenpeace share]{.mark} an
[anti-humanist vision of progress]{.mark}

[Greenpeace's opposition]{.mark} to GMOs [brought condemnation]{.mark}
from one Harvard professor of genetics, George Church. In an interview
with Edge he said: "[A million lives are at stake every year]{.mark} due
to vitamin A deficiency, and Golden Rice was basically ready for use in
2002...every year you delay it, that's another million people dead.
[That's **[mass murder]{.underline}** on a high scale]{.mark}. In fact,
as I understand it there is an effort to bring them to trial at The
Hague for crimes against humanity. Maybe that's justified, maybe it
isn't."

Both Extinction Rebellion and Greenpeace share an anti-humanist vision
of progress. They adopt a Malthusian mindset which falsely attributes
over-population as the primary cause of climate change. It is us and our
apparent insatiable desire for capital that is the problem. But human
beings --- far from being what David Attenborough calls a "plague" ---
are a creative and intelligent species. [We are living in]{.mark} a
[period of great scientific achievement]{.mark}. Whilst we have not
quite reached the environmental nirvana many of these groups push for,
we have made great progress. [[On]{.mark} a [national level]{.mark}, we
have [decarbonised]{.mark} our eco[nomy faster than any other]{.mark}
major [economy]{.mark} in the last twenty years. Whilst globally**,
[deaths from climate-related disasters]{.mark} have [decreased by 90 per
cent]{.mark} [over]{.mark} the [past hundred
years]{.mark}**.]{.underline} With this in context [do]{.mark} [we
really need to have]{.mark} our [consciousness "raised" as]{.mark} so
many [activists claim]{.mark}?

[[Rather]{.mark} [than]{.mark} [advocating genuine environmental
reform]{.mark}, [Greenpeace]{.mark} have [regularly pursued **dangerous
campaigns**]{.mark} that [stand in **direct opposition to
progress**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Their [stubborn refusal to accept
scientific consensus and embrace technological innovation]{.mark} means
they **[are [harming far more than]{.mark} they are
[helping]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
