### Vocabulary

#### Thucydides' Trap

The idea (first coined by Graham Allison) that when a rising power
challenges an established dominant power in the status quo, the result
is almost always war.

This works in tandem with heg bad because US retrenchment allows China
or Russia to rise and claim dominance\-\--clinging reverses that because
it's perceived as the US denying China or Russia status.

#### Antonio Gramsci

A 1910s Italian anti-fascist who wrote about the theory of cultural
hegemony.

Way too many of the cards here mention him for some reason.

#### Offshore balancing

Offshore balancing is a strategy for retrenchment.

It decreases US military presence to allow semi-diplomatic/semi-military
interactions with China to decrease tensions.

It would shift military alliance burdens to other countries.

This is strategic because (presumably, if debated correctly) it should
solve a lot of their "China world order bad" offense.

It counterbalances China's rise through diplomacy/military/intelligence
strategies (with regional allies also) and helps allies only when it is
really needed.

This also means you can make claims that China or multilateral
cooperation solves their impacts.

As he sat in prison in 1930, at the opening of a fateful decade, the
Italian anti-fascist Antonio Gramsci wrote: "[The crisis consists
precisely in the fact that the **old is dying** and the **new cannot be
born**; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms
appear]{.underline}."

[The world is now in a **Gramscian interregnum**. The **old
order**---Pax **Americana**---is **breaking down**]{.underline}.
Electorates across the West are in revolt as the industrial era's social
contract has given way to the socioeconomic insecurity of the digital
age and the hollowing out of the middle class. [Decades of **strategic
overreach** and **hyperglobalization** have cracked the bipartisan
consensus behind **liberal internationalism** that **long guided** U.S.
statecraft. Waves of immigration have sparked an angry
**ethno-nationalism** that advantages ideological extremes]{.underline}.
Meanwhile, [power in the international system is **shifting** from
**West to East** and **North to South**, undermining a **global order**
that rested on the West's material and ideological
**primacy**]{.underline}.

It is in this context that President [Trump could be the **agent of
change** that is needed. His **America First** brand of statecraft
breaks decisively from the **liberal internationalist mold** that has
shaped the **grand strategy** of successive administrations **since
World War II**]{.underline}. But though that mold may well need to be
shattered, it will also need to be replaced. Trump must pursue change
that is radical but responsible, reforming the world that America made
rather than merely destroying it. Judging by the administration's first
month, there is quite considerable cause for concern that Trump will
quite handily fulfill his mandate to be a demolition man, but fall well
short of his duty to be the architect of the international order that
comes next. The task before Congress, the courts, the media, and the
American people is to help ensure that the promise of America First
prevails over its peril.

THE PROMISE OF AMERICA FIRST

[Trump's America First foreign policy]{.underline} finds few supporters
among the foreign policy establishment, but it [offers distinct
advantages. His **transactional and pragmatic engagement** with
adversaries may well help **tame mounting geopolitical rivalry**.
Preparing a diplomatic push to end Russia's war against Ukraine is
**pragmatism**, not capitulation]{.underline}; the death and destruction
need to stop. [Trump was smart to invite Xi Jinping to his
**inauguration**; if he can eventually sit down with Xi, cut a **trade
deal**, and ease **rising geopolitical tensions**, he will advance the
economic as well as strategic interests of the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. [Trump appears ready
to open negotiations with **Iran**]{.underline}. Now that Israel has
weakened Tehran and pummeled its proxies in the Middle East, [a
diplomatic breakthrough may be achievable. Should Trump succeed in
**lowering the temperature** with adversaries, he will make the world a
safer place while **scaling back** the nation's **onerous commitments
abroad**, thereby easing the **chronic strategic overreach** that has
led Americans to turn **inward**]{.underline}.

Trump also understands that globalization has left many workers behind,
and that open trade has benefited far too few Americans; he is
appropriately looking to level the commercial playing field. He is
heading in the right direction by seeking a solution to illegal
immigration, responding to the clamor of an electorate that knows full
well that the country lacks a functioning immigration system. And Trump
will be doing the nation a service if he can downsize the federal
government, make it more efficient, and help reduce the national debt.

[More pragmatism and less ideology, **more restraint** and fewer wars,
more focus on solving problems at **home** and less on defending
democracy **abroad**]{.underline}, more government efficiency and less
waste---[these strategic shifts should serve the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [well is it seeks to
manage a world of growing disarray, **diffusing power**, and stark
political diversity]{.underline}. Trump's statecraft is in these
respects an appropriate response to a changing world and a changing
America.

THE PERIL OF AMERICA FIRST

Yet even if Trump's America First foreign policy has considerable
promise, it is also fraught with risk. His transactional approach to
diplomacy could morph into a stiff-necked unilateralism that shatters
alliances and undermines collective efforts where they are needed. His
effort to limit U.S. entanglements abroad could lead to U.S. underreach,
leaving dangerous vacuums of power. His reluctance to promote democracy
overseas could shade into disregard for democratic norms at home,
potentially resulting in irreversible damage to the nation's
representative institutions. And in his determination to shake up the
political establishment, Trump could break the U.S. government rather
than reform it. A broken federal government will be in no shape to fix a
broken America or a broken world. In short, Trump's America First
strategy could easily descend into excess and incoherence---and is
quickly headed in that direction.

Trump's pragmatic readiness to engage adversaries is a welcome shift,
but now the hazard lies on the other side---that Trump will embrace a
self-defeating unilateralism and shun alliances and other collective
efforts; America First is becoming America Alone. [**Unilateralism won't
work in today's world**; no nation can opt out of a globe that has grown
**irreversibly interdependent**. Countering **aggression**, managing
international **commerce**, arresting global **warming**, preventing
**nuclear proliferation**, regulating the development and deployment of
**AI**---these are only a few of the shared challenges that necessitate
international teamwork. If the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [walks away from collective effort, **others
will do the same**]{.underline}. And allies don't diminish U.S. power;
they augment it.

Nonetheless, Trump has again withdrawn from the Paris Climate agreement
and the World Health Organization. He is demeaning allies and
undermining NATO. Trump's unilateralist threats to use economic coercion
to annex Canada and military coercion to take control of the Panama
Canal and Greenland are, simply put, bizarre. Trump's enthusiasm for
tariffs is another worrying plank of his unilateralist agenda. Modest
and selective tariffs could do some good, protecting sensitive
technological sectors, bringing home a few manufacturing jobs, and
pressuring foreign governments to provide U.S. goods with better market
access.

Yet if Trump puts up the high tariff walls that he is envisaging, he
could well spark a trade war that wreaks havoc on international trade
and global prosperity and inflames geopolitical tensions. Tariff
barriers would also hurt, not help, America's working families by
increasing the cost of consumer goods while failing to turn the United
States back into the "manufacturing powerhouse" that Trump has promised.
Largely as a consequence of automation, some 80 percent of the U.S.
workforce is already employed in the service sector; most of those
workers are not returning to the production line.

Trump is right that the United States tends to overreach abroad, but now
the risk ahead is underreach; [the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [needs not an isolationist retreat, but instead
a **middle ground** between doing too much and doing too
little]{.underline}. Ukraine will be an early test. Trump is right to
try to end the conflict; a war that drags on indefinitely could
eventually turn Ukraine into a failed state. But even though Russia will
almost certainly retain, at least for now, the 20 percent of Ukraine it
currently occupies, Washington must ensure that the remaining 80 percent
is a success story. To leave Ukraine indefensible and permanently
subject to Moscow's predation and coercion would be to hand a victory
not only to Russia, but to China, Iran, and North Korea, all of which
are backing Russian aggression.

Trump appears likely to either overdo or underdo China. He's a hawk when
it comes to trade but could well balk at the risks of a military
confrontation, especially over Taiwan. In the past he has demanded that
Taiwan pay for U.S. "protection," claimed that it had "stolen" America's
semiconductor industry, and equivocated about defending the island. The
responsible path is to undertake cautious but constructive engagement,
aiming to rebalance trade, ratchet down geopolitical tension, and carve
out a working relationship on issues ranging from technological
competition to global health---all while preserving a stable status quo
on Taiwan.

Ideological hubris has often pushed U.S. statecraft off course, and
[Trump exhibits due caution toward the **overzealous promotion** of
democracy abroad. He has **correctly traced American overreach** in the
Middle East to the "dangerous idea]{.underline} that we could make
Western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interest
in becoming a Western democracy."

#### Clinging to [self-defeating unilateralism]{.underline} causes [adversaries]{.underline} to forgo engagement. 

**Kupchan '25** \[Charles; senior fellow at the Council on Foreign
Relations and professor of international affairs at Georgetown
University in the Walsh School of Foreign Service and Department of

The world is now in a Gramscian interregnum. The old order---Pax
Americana---is breaking down. Electorates across the West are in revolt
as the industrial era's social contract has given way to the
socioeconomic insecurity of the digital age. Waves of immigration have
sparked an angry ethno-nationalism that advantages ideological extremes.
Power in the international system is shifting from West to East and
North to South, undermining a global order that rested on the West's
material and ideological primacy. [Russia and China are **pushing back**
against a liberal order that they see as a **mask for U.S. hegemony**.
Many in the **global South** have grown **impatient** with an
international system they see as exploitative, inequitable, and
unjust]{.underline}.

[Pax Americana is **past its expiration date**, but the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[won't let
go]{.underline}**. Instead of beginning the hard work of figuring out
what comes next, the **[Biden]{.underline}** administration
[spent]{.underline} its [**four years** defending the "liberal
rules-based order" that emerged after **World War II** and seeking to
turn back any and all challenges to it. The results are telling:
**disaffection at home** and **disorder abroad**. The **old is dying**,
the **new cannot be born**, and a great variety of **morbid symptoms**
has appeared]{.underline}.

In this context, Donald Trump could be a necessary agent of change. His
"America First" brand of statecraft---transactional, neo-isolationist,
unilateralist, and protectionist---breaks decisively from the liberal
internationalist mold that has shaped the grand strategy of successive
administrations since World War II. But though that mold may well need
to be shattered, it will also need to be replaced. And Trump is more
demolition man than architect. Instead of helping build a new and better
international order, he may well bring down the old one and simply leave
the United States and the rest of the world standing in the rubble.

Trump will nevertheless be the president of the world's most powerful
country for the next four years. Americans will have to make the best of
his efforts to revamp U.S. foreign policy. That means welcoming Trump's
recognition that the country needs a new grand strategy---then pushing
him to pursue change that is radical but responsible, and to reform the
world that America made rather than merely destroying it.

[Pax Americana was born during the **1940s**. World War II and the onset
of the Cold War whetted the country's **appetite** for an **expansive
internationalism**. Democrats and Republicans **both** rallied behind a
grand strategy that secured geopolitical stability and prosperity by
**projecting U.S. power globally** and establishing an open,
multilateral order among **like-minded democracies**]{.underline}.

[Today, that internationalist **consensus has shattered**.
Deindustrialization and the hollowing out of the **middle class**,
decades of **strategic overreach** and **hyperglobalization**, and an
influx of **immigrants** that has contributed to rapid shifts in the
country's **demographic makeup** have all **sapped political support**
for liberal internationalism. Enter **Trump** and his **politics of
grievance**. "The forgotten men and women of our country will be
forgotten no longer," he pledged in his inaugural address in
2017]{.underline}. "From this moment on, it's going to be America First.
Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs,
will be made to benefit American workers and American families."

[Trump in his first term **failed**]{.underline} to get "forgotten"
Americans back up on their feet. This is one of the reasons he lost his
bid for reelection to Joe Biden. [Biden then oversaw a **"restoration"
presidency**, reinstating liberal internationalism and standing **firmly
behind Pax Americana**. But the foreign policy he pursued was better
matched to the world that was. Biden consolidated **traditional American
alliances** in Europe and Asia and took the lead in helping
Ukraine]{.underline} defend itself against Russian aggression. [But he
leaves office amid **deepening global disorder**, and without having
even **tried** to negotiate an end to a war that Ukraine cannot
win]{.underline}. Biden pledged to pursue a "foreign policy for the
middle class," but during his presidency, [the electorate remained
**polarized**, and blue-collar voters further **gravitated toward
Trump**]{.underline}.

Now [Trump has a chance to **try again**]{.underline}. His "America
First" agenda tends to make the foreign-policy establishment recoil, but
it offers distinct advantages. Trump's transactional and pragmatic
engagement with adversaries may do more to tame geopolitical rivalry
than Biden's view of a globe defined by a clash between democracy and
autocracy. Trump's readiness to negotiate with Russia, China, and Iran
is exactly what's needed.

Preparing a diplomatic push to end Russia's war against Ukraine is
pragmatism, not capitulation; the death and destruction need to stop.
Trump was smart to invite Xi Jinping to his inauguration; if he can
eventually sit down with Xi, cut a trade deal, and ease rising
geopolitical tensions, more power to him. Elon Musk, one of Trump's
confidants, has already met with Iran's UN ambassador; now that Israel
has weakened Tehran and pummeled its proxies in the Middle East, a
diplomatic breakthrough may be achievable. Should Trump succeed in
lowering the temperature with adversaries, he will make the world a
safer place while scaling back the nation's onerous commitments abroad,
thereby easing the chronic strategic overreach that has led Americans to
turn inward.

Trump also understands that globalization has left many workers behind
and that open trade has benefited far too few Americans; he is
appropriately looking to level the commercial playing field. He is
heading in the right direction by seeking a solution to illegal
immigration, responding to the clamor of an electorate that knows full
well that the country lacks a functioning immigration system. And Trump
will be doing the nation a service if he can downsize the federal
government, make it more efficient, and help reduce the national debt.

More pragmatism and less ideology, more restraint and fewer wars, more
focus on solving problems at home and less on defending democracy
abroad, more government efficiency and less waste---these strategic
shifts should serve the United States well is it seeks to manage a world
of growing disarray, diffusing power, and stark political diversity.
Trump's statecraft is, in these respects, not the impulse of a misguided
and capricious demagogue but an appropriate response to a changing world
and a changing America.

Yet even if Trump's "America First" foreign policy has considerable
promise, it is also fraught with risk. His transactional approach to
diplomacy could morph into a stiff-necked unilateralism that undermines
collective efforts where they are needed. His effort to limit U.S.
entanglements abroad could lead to U.S. underreach, leaving dangerous
vacuums of power. His reluctance to promote democracy overseas could
shade into disregard for democratic norms at home, potentially resulting
in irreversible damage to the nation's representative institutions. And
in his determination to shake up the political establishment, Trump
could break the U.S. government rather than reform it. A broken federal
government will be in no shape to fix a broken America or a broken
world.

Trump's strategy could easily descend into excess and incoherence. The
work ahead will be to encourage Trump's better instincts, counter his
more malign ones, and channel both into something resembling a coherent
and constructive grand strategy.

For the past four years, the [Biden]{.underline} administration has
[tightened relations with allies but **neglected** diplomacy where it
was **most needed**, with **Russia and China**. Trump's readiness to
**engage adversaries** could be a **welcome shift**]{.underline}. But
now [the **hazard will lie**]{.underline} on the other side---[that
Trump will embrace a **self-defeating unilateralism** and shun alliances
and other **collective efforts**; "America First" would then become
"**America Alone**."]{.underline}

#### Trump will fill in the void with [offshore balancing]{.underline}\-\--that avoids [Taiwan invasion]{.underline} through [A2/AD technologies]{.underline}. 

**Desch '25** \[Michael; Packey J. Dee Professor of International
Affairs, Department of Political Science, Brian and Jeannelle Brady
Director, Notre Dame International Security Center, University of Notre
Dame. January 29; "Balancing Away from War: How the USA and China Can
Side-step the Thucydides' Trap," *The Chinese Journal of International
Politics*, Vol. 18, Issue 2, pp. 151-172; //ff\]

A balance of power reading of Thucydides suggests that [US\' efforts to
maintain its **post-Cold War hegemonic position**, either
**unilaterally** or through broader consent, are bound to **fail**. The
post-Cold War "unipolar moment" was **not a permanent fact** but rather
a **temporary artifact** of the sudden and unexpected collapse of **one
pole in a bipolar system**]{.underline}.187 By virtue of its large
population and high level of economic growth, [**China** was destined to
**replace** the Soviet Union as **another pole** in the 21st century
international system]{.underline}. The interesting question is not
whether unipolarity will last but will it be replaced with a bipolar or
multipolar system?188

[One of the most important causes of **hegemonic wars** in the wake of
**power transitions** is the **security dilemma**, the unintended
dynamic in which the efforts one state takes to ensure its security
often **undermine** that of others]{.underline}.189 While in an
anarchical international system, the security dilemma can never be
completely eliminated, it can be mitigated by the policies states adopt.
Thucydides attributes the Peloponnesian War to the breakdown of the
balance of power between Athens and Sparta and he applauds Pericles'
efforts to try to re-establish it through restraint rather than
replacing Spartan hegemony. [Not only is a **balance of power** grand
strategy **less likely** to exacerbate the security dilemma, it is
eminently **more feasible** and will better serve **American
interests**]{.underline}.190

[A balance of power approach by the USA in its **rivalry with China**
will be effective because it builds upon a number of **well-established
tendencies** in international politics]{.underline}.191 Most
importantly, [states **tend to balance** against threats, rather than
bandwagoning with them]{.underline}.192 [As China **grows more
powerful** and assertive, states closest to it are feeling a greater
sense of peril. Their response will be to **seek ways to respond** to
that threat by **counterbalancing** it. A **less forward and assertive
US posture** will not only **mitigate** the security dilemma with China
but also **dampen** common pathologies of balancing such as
**buck-passing** by allies to the larger power and otherwise
**under-providing** for their own security. The common problem behind
both is what economists call "**moral hazard**," or the propensity of
actors to behave **recklessly** if another is insuring them **against
its consequences**]{.underline}.193

Some fret that recent Chinese investments in [anti-access/area denial
(**A2/AD**) technologies]{.underline} make it harder for the USA to
continue to project power close to China. However, these same
technologies [could]{.underline} also [**bolster** America's
**beleaguered allies** in the region]{.underline}.194 [**Taiwan**, the
most probable **casus belli**, is **further** from mainland China than
Great Britain was from Nazi-held Europe and about the same distance that
Cuba was from Cold War Florida. Despite these relatively **short
distances**, neither was **ever successfully invaded**. Today, China
will have to project power **across water**]{.underline}, always
[a]{.underline} dicey [proposition]{.underline} but one
**[made]{.underline}** even [**harder** now if US allies in the region
invest in their **own A2/AD technologies** to preserve the **balance of
power**]{.underline}.

Donald [**Trump's return** to the White House raises the question of
whether he might be **more amenable** to **replacing** America's
long-standing **Primacy approach** to maintaining the status quo in the
Western Pacific with one premised upon a **balance of
power**?]{.underline}195 [There are]{.underline}, in fact, [grounds for
thinking that **Trump might be**. The latter approach would **not seek
to prevent any change** in the region, only those that threaten the
global balance of power. During his first term in office, he adopted a
more "**transactional approach** \[which\] often differed from his
team's competitive approach]{.underline}."196 To be sure, the recently
re-elected former President has not shied away from economic competition
with China and has shown little compunction about rattling the tariff
saber and even threatening a trade war. But [he seems "**ambivalent**"
about embracing the American China hawks' **commitment** to defend
**Taiwan** against China if it seeks independence]{.underline}.197
Hardly anyone would compare the former and future President to the great
Athenian leader Pericles, but [it is **entirely possible** that Trump
might at least embrace a Periclean **balance of power approach** as a
way out of the **Thucydides' Trap**]{.underline}.

Thucydides' fundamental lessons for the contemporary USA in its rivalry
with China is that democratic Athens erred when it grasped for primacy
by expanding its empire during the Peloponnesian War; [today America
**does not need** to preserve a position of **primacy** in East Asia but
can instead rest content with maintaining a **balance of power**
there]{.underline}. Indeed, the tragedy of Thucydides' account is that
neither Athens nor Sparta appreciated the limits imposed upon their
striving for primacy by the balance of power.198 The best grand strategy
for the contemporary USA I believe, and the Thucydidean approach I know,
favors the more restrained balance of power approach for the USA to
manage its rivalry with China in this century without blundering into
the "Thucydides' trap."

[[Beijing]{.mark} and [Washington]{.mark}]{.underline} have become
[desensitized to the risk]{.underline} these circumstances pose. But in
the militarization of foreign policy and the failure to grasp the full
significance of that militarization, [the pair [are **one
accident**]{.mark}]{.underline} and a bad decision [removed
[from]{.mark} a **[catastrophic war]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Mathematicians speak of [the]{.underline} "**[edge of
chaos]{.underline}**": the final point separating order from doom. A
system operating at this edge has no room for error. This is where the
[accumulated weight of]{.underline} the past has brought the United
States, China, and **[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [They
[walked]{.mark}]{.underline} right [[up to]{.mark} the [edge of]{.mark}
a war that could go **[nuclear several times]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
the past: in 1954-55, 1958, and 1996. Now, [they seem to be living **on
that edge** permanently]{.underline}.

In recent years, [[China's policy]{.underline}]{.mark} has **[alienated
Taiwan]{.underline}** completely. As China has bullied, threatened, and
displayed force at home and abroad, [it has [made unification
unacceptable]{.mark} to much of the **Taiwanese
electorate**]{.underline}. And it has enjoyed only mixed success in
trying to isolate Taiwan diplomatically. It has managed to buy off many
of Taiwan's erstwhile allies, but its conduct over COVID-19 and support
for Russia despite the invasion of Ukraine have cost it friends,
too---and those former friends have turned to the island across the
strait.

\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS END\>\>

Since at least 2021, Taiwan has had a seemingly endless parade of
visitors, from Germany's education minister to Liz Truss, the former
U.K. prime minister. In November 2021, the European Parliament sent its
first official delegation to the island; the head of the delegation,
Raphaël Glucksmann, told Tsai, "We in Europe are also confronted with
interference from authoritarian regimes and we came here to learn from
you." In October 2022, Tsai received lawmakers from Lithuania and
Ukraine; the former had recently established a representative office in
Taiwan despite Beijing's anger, while the latter was making a gesture of
solidarity with a country that, unlike China, had been sharp in its
criticism of Moscow. A Japanese parliamentary delegation that arrived in
December 2022 spoke glowingly of Tsai's defense plans and emphasized
Japan's own determination to keep the status quo in the region from
being "changed by force or unilaterally." China has warned against or
condemned many of these visits. Beijing has only itself to blame for
Taiwan's strengthened diplomatic position. Its wolf warrior nationalism
and reluctance to break with Moscow have cost it European support. If
visits from foreign politicians were to translate into condemnation of
China at the United Nations, Beijing could veto a Security Council
resolution. In this case, like Russia, China would find itself a pariah
state---and unlike Russia, China cares about how it is seen by the
world. China's own corrosive nationalism has eaten into its body
politic, too. It has not torn itself apart in a bout of political
bloodletting, but it has certainly let loose the kind of jingoism that
would allow that to happen. What it will decide to do in a crisis is
uncertain. Beijing itself does not know. The United States, meanwhile,
seems intent on reviving a defense treaty with Taipei that it once spent
more than a decade trying to break. Taiwan has become a means of showing
China just how tough the United States can get. Washington is not clear
on how getting tough will alter Beijing's conduct, but "deterrence" is
the concept invoked most often. A show of force, the thinking goes, will
deter China from aggression. But what if deterrence fails? What if the
show of force backs China into a corner from which it feels it has no
option but to lash out? To this, Washington has few answers beyond
preparing for war. Some U.S. pundits have waxed lyrical about how they
would fight a war with China. Taiwan, they opined, will be turned into a
"porcupine" with hardened defenses. One former defense official
suggested the use of "low-yield tactical nuclear weapons" in the event
of a conflict with China. (The bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki
qualify as low yield.) The possibility of Russian President Vladimir
Putin using such weapons sent shock waves of horror through the world,
but the idea of employing them in a war with China became normal in some
circles. There was no guarantee that, once the nuclear taboo was
breached, the weapons would stay "low yield." But the question of what
would happen if the two powers escalated to higher-yield arms and
plunged the world into nuclear holocaust has been left unresolved. It is
as though the United States is being haunted by all the ghosts of its
long past with China and Taiwan, forcing it to relive questions it had
once thought resolved. U.S. military leader Douglas MacArthur wanted to
wage war against China in 1950. President Dwight D. Eisenhower
considered using nuclear weapons against China in 1955 and 1958. Today,
Washington abides by the "One China" principle, but it wants Taiwan to
enjoy "self-determination." It vows that it does not dispute the
formulation that Taiwan is a part of China, but it will help Taiwan
resist Chinese coercion. It wishes to promote Taiwan's presence in
international organizations, but it remains unwilling to recognize
Taiwan itself. The United States has shifted from pure ambiguity to
ambiguity with a tilt in favor of Taiwan---and it has done so because it
decided China is an enemy.

[denounced]{.mark}]{.underline} French President Emmanuel [Macron
for]{.underline} "**[kissing [Xi]{.mark}'s ass]{.underline}**,"
referring to Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Joe Biden, with the power of the
incumbent, has not stopped at rhetoric. Whether supporting a TikTok ban
unless the app is sold or calling for increased tariffs on Chinese
goods, his policies are calibrated to demonstrate toughness on China.

[[Taiwan's]{.mark} own **presidential elections**]{.underline}, held on
Jan. 13, showed just how deeply [the island's [electorate]{.mark} had
**[turned against unification]{.mark}**]{.underline}. At first, William
Lai, the candidate from Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), vowed
not to alter the status quo, though he accused Beijing of doing so.
Taiwan, he argued, was already sovereign. There was no need to change
what worked. But his caution soon vanished. While campaigning, Lai
defined success for Taiwan as its leaders being able to visit the White
House. This was a gauntlet thrown down---Taiwanese officials are blocked
from visiting Washington. The Biden administration immediately demanded
an explanation. This was not, U.S. officials made clear, how the
relationship worked. Where Tsai had been prudent, Lai was willing to
push his luck.

The Kuomintang (**[KMT]{.underline}**), the main opposition party, [was
not leaning **toward Beijing**]{.underline}, either. Its nominee, Hou
You-yi, the mayor of New Taipei City, said that he would reject both
"one country, two systems" and a formal move for independence, but that
if Taiwan were attacked, he would face the challenge. Taiwan, according
to Hou, needed to be ready to defend itself. On the crucial question of
how to deal with China, there was little difference between the policies
Lai and Hou espoused.

A third candidate, Ko Wen-je of the Taiwan People's Party, was
calculatedly vague on China policy. His campaign made clear that he was
depending on votes from traditional KMT supporters: those who would have
favored a closer relationship with China. He claimed that he would find
the middle ground between the KMT's appeasement of China and the DPP's
provocation of it; he would make Taiwan a bridge for Sino-American
communication rather than a front in a Sino-American war. How he
proposed to do all this was left undefined.

Lai eventually won the presidency, but it was not the ringing triumph
Tsai had won four years earlier. Lai scraped through with a mere 40
percent of the vote, his victory made easier by the fact that Hou and Ko
had failed to join forces. As he prepares to take office on May 20, Lai
faces a deeply divided, volatile populace and a legislature in which the
DPP is bereft of a majority.

This is a point China has been quick to underline. The DPP, it huffed
after the election, is not representative of "majority public opinion."
What is lost on Beijing is that the other candidates made clear that
unification was not something they were willing to countenance either.
Hou had made a point of not inviting Ma Ying-jeou, the last KMT member
to serve as Taiwan's president, to his rallies; he knew that to
associate himself with Ma's embrace of China would have doomed his
candidacy. [Beijing still **does not understand Taiwan**]{.underline}.
[Meanwhile]{.underline}, [[the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[continues to]{.mark} disavow support
for **Taiwanese independence** while making [plan]{.mark}s [for

the]{.underline} U.S. **[presidential election]{.underline}** going into
fifth gear, [the **[risk of miscalc]{.mark}ulation** [will only
rise]{.mark}]{.underline}.

At the edge of chaos, [[a **single choice**]{.mark} can make the
difference between **order and catastrophe**]{.underline}. More than 80
years on from the Cairo Declaration, which held that Taiwan would be
"restored to the Republic of China" at the end of World War II, we can
see that there were myriad moments that could have yielded different
outcomes, for better or for worse. If President Franklin D. Roosevelt
had insisted on self-determination for Taiwan after World War II, if the
Korean War had not happened, if Beijing had made "one country, two
systems" work, if Taiwan had developed a nuclear weapon, if Pelosi's
plane had indeed been shot at---if someone had made a different decision
at any of those moments, the world would be a radically different place.

[When deterrence]{.underline}, toughness, [and pride drive
policy]{.underline}, [the room for error diminishes **to virtually
nil**]{.underline}. China, Taiwan, and the United States are at a point
where the [choices]{.underline} they make [could [spell]{.mark} the

[The world can be an ugly place. Russia invaded **Ukraine**. **Sudan**
is consumed by civil war. **Haiti** is overrun by violent gangs.
Conflict has surged in the]{.underline} **[D]{.underline}**emocratic
**[R]{.underline}**epublic of **[C]{.underline}**ongo. [**Somalia** is
ravaged by violence. **Israel** is waging war on Palestinians. In
**Burma** the military regime is committing murder and
mayhem]{.underline}.

The list goes on: [**Syria** remains divided and at risk after years of
conflict. Islamist violence is consuming **Nigeria**'s Christians and
moderate Muslims. China is threatening to forcibly reclaim **Taiwan**.
The Trump administration is killing **Yemen**is and threatening to bomb
**Iran**. Europeans are pushing America toward a direct military
confrontation with **Moscow**]{.underline}.

These and other conflicts and potential conflicts are terrible. [Many
people]{.underline}, especially in Washington, [look to the U.S. for
answers]{.underline}. In their view, if only Uncle Sam is willing to
"lead," the lion will be forced to lie down with the lamb. And all will
be well.

Unfortunately, [this strategy, as evidenced by the last **three
decades**, has proved to be **disastrous**. Fixing the world proved to
be well beyond Washington's capability]{.underline}. Equally important,
[these battles aren't Americans' responsibility]{.underline}.

President Trump should ignore the foreign policy "Blob" and act with
restraint on the international stage.

That's a controversial belief in Washington, where commitment to the
U.S. as the crusader state dies hard. Even the Trump administration,
staffed with more neocon warriors than MAGA realists, seems determined
on war somewhere. Indeed, the conviction that Washington should fix
every problem and right every wrong is widely shared. I recently
attended a conference on religious persecution around the world, an
issue that I have covered for years. I was surprised when a long-time
colleague vehemently criticized my long-held opposition to Washington's
continuing military presence in Syria.

Never mind that the American people have never thought of, let alone
debated, protecting Syria's Kurds. Or that the president has not
negotiated and the Senate has not ratified a defense treaty. That Syria
never has been a significant security interest for America. That
Washington did much to harm Syrian civilians by fueling the civil war
and applying brutal sanctions. That maintaining a garrison entangles the
U.S. in the globe's most volatile region. That [protecting Syrian Kurds
requires an **ongoing**, potentially **permanent military
presence**]{.underline}. That American forces in Syria face multiple
challengers, including Russia, Iran, ISIS, unaffiliated Islamist
radicals, NATO ally Turkey, and the new Damascus regime, whose leaders
once were affiliated with Al Qaeda. Or that such involvement is not in
Americans' interest.

Still, this person [wanted the U.S. military to stick around. Not
forever, they insisted. However, no one in the region]{.underline},
especially in the newly emerging Syrian government, which would like to
reestablish control over all the land it now purports to rule, and
Turkey, which has invaded Syria's north and used proxy forces to rule
over ethnic Kurdish borderlands, [is prepared to abandon its claim.
Which means **any U.S. commitment** must be **open ended** and any U.S.
forces must remain **perpetually ready for combat**]{.underline}.

There is no duty for any government more fundamental than protecting its
people. The Constitution speaks of the "common defense." But that means
of Americans, not the world. Most importantly, that also means defense.
Not conducting grand crusades around the globe to bring paradise to
earth.

Washington should be prepared to deter war against and defeat
antagonists of Americans. Although the U.S. need not wait for the
invaders to touch American soil, to act [Washington should confront a
genuine threat, not seek to create an **idealized version** of **Pax
Americana** in the far reaches of the globe]{.underline}. Defending the
U.S. has gotten more complicated in today's world, where conflict can
take various forms. Nevertheless, defense still means defense. Just as
Supreme Court justices know pornography when they see it, Americans know
cant about humanitarian war-making when they hear it. To constrain the
Blob, as the foreign policy establishment has been called, it is vital
to narrowly define both the foreign policy end and military means.

What makes international affairs so complicated is that it is
prudential, requiring a judgment call in ever varying circumstances. For
instance, Imperial Germany's Kaiser Friedrich Wilhelm and Nazi Germany's
Adolf Hitler warranted very different responses. [**Unnecessary
intervention** in World War I **inadvertently** led to **World War II**,
which was far more difficult for Washington to avoid]{.underline}. In
retrospect the Soviet Union's ambitions look more limited than feared at
the time. However, policymakers must deal with reality as it appears at
the time. The results often are counterproductive, sometimes
disastrously so.

Indeed, many of today's hot spots, some literally on fire, are to
varying degrees America's or the broader West's responsibility. Such is
the Russia--**[Ukraine]{.underline}** conflict, [in which the
U.S.]{.underline} and European allies have been fighting a proxy
war-plus, very [**publicly helping** Ukraine kill **thousands** of
Russians]{.underline}. Moscow chose to initiate hostilities, an unjust
and unjustified invasion. However, [Washington]{.underline} and its NATO
partners broke multiple promises not to expand the alliance to Russia's
borders, [launched an **aggressive war** against
**Serbia**]{.underline}, a long-time friend of Moscow, and [promoted
**regime change** in]{.underline} neighboring [**Georgia** and
**Ukraine**, where a democratically-elected president who leaned east
was ousted. Had the **Soviet Union** conducted a similar campaign
against **Mexico**, the U.S. and USSR would have been at the **brink of
war**, like over **Cuba** during the Cold War. **Catastrophe** could
result. Russia possesses **nuclear weapons**, which it uses to make up
for **conventional inferiority**, and **cares a lot more** about Ukraine
than America, which never challenged Moscow's rule over that territory,
even during the Cold War]{.underline}.

[In the Middle East, the U.S. has proved to be a **prodigious killer**.
Washington waged war on **Iraq (twice)**]{.underline},
**[Libya]{.underline}**, **[Syria]{.underline}**, [and **Yemen**,
causing hundreds of thousands of civilian casualties. The U.S. is
threatening Iran, **again**]{.underline}. A war there could be worse
than all the others combined.

Moreover, [Washington has shaped its policy to protect the interests of
**Saudi Arabia** and **Israel** rather than America. They **long looked
to war**]{.underline}, and, more importantly, war [by **America**, as
the answer to their problems]{.underline}. For instance, the Guardian
reported: "The Saudi king was recorded as having 'frequently exhorted
the U.S. to attack Iran to put an end to its nuclear weapons program,'
one cable stated. 'He told you \[Americans\] to cut off the head of the
snake,' the Saudi ambassador to Washington, Adel al-Jubeir said,
according to a report on Abdullah's meeting with the U.S. general David
Petraeus in April 2008."

Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu has long campaigned for the same result. For
instance, noted the Quincy Institute's Trita Parsi, "By ringing the
alarm bells on Iran's growing nuclear program, Netanyahu had hoped to
eliminate Obama's 'kick the can down the road' option and force
Washington to strike Iran militarily." Netanyahu similarly pushed Biden
to act, but "almost all \[of his plans\] required significant U.S.
support via direct military intervention or intelligence sharing. Israel
has also requested that Washington help Israel defend itself should Iran
retaliate." The prime minister continues to push for war. According to
the New York Times: "[Israel had planned to **strike Iranian nuclear
sites** as soon as next month but was waved off by]{.underline}
President [Trump in recent weeks in favor of negotiating a deal with
Tehran]{.underline}." Apparently, [even **Trump** is **wary** of his
nominal friend. During his first term, the president complained that
**Israel**'s premier was "**willing to fight Iran to the last American
soldier**]{.underline}."

Unfortunately, Washington's refusal to do its supposed clients' bidding
in this case was unusual. In Yemen the U.S. aided the Saudi royals,
among the world's worst human rights abusers, in killing tens or
hundreds of thousands of civilians to reinstate a puppet regime. Hamas
warrants obvious condemnation for its atrocities, but Israel's killing
of tens of thousands of civilians goes well beyond a legitimate
response. Yet there appears to be no crime against Palestinians that the
U.S. will not excuse.

Worst of all, [the U.S. is **thoughtlessly careening** toward a
**potential war** with China over **Taiwan** with little thought of the
consequences]{.underline}. Only a very few voices have been raised in
Washington against the idea of confronting Beijing militarily if it
moves against Taiwan, a territory as close to the Chinese mainland as
Cuba is to America. However, [battling a major conventional power
possessing **nuclear weapons** over an issue which it **views as
existential** is a prescription for catastrophe]{.underline}. Even in
the minority of cases when the [U.S. wins **war games**]{.underline} it
suffers major losses in manpower and materiel, [and the exercises
typically **presume no use of nuclear weapons**. America's response to
Soviet military activities in **Cuba** offer a **scary foretaste** of
how Beijing might ultimately respond to **increased U.S. military
activity** on and around **Taiwan**]{.underline}.

#### 2. [RCA]{.underline}. Flips sustainability. 

**Bandow '25** \[Doug; senior fellow at the Cato Institute, specializing
in foreign policy and civil liberties. January 28; "America's Great
Mistake: Pushing Russia and China Together," Cato Institute,
https://www.cato.org/commentary/americas-great-mistake-pushing-russia-china-together;
//ff\]

The [emergence of **several adversary regimes**]{.underline}, of late
tagged as the Axis of Disruption, Axis of Upheaval, Axis of Autocracy,
and even new Axis of Evil, [has come as a **terrible shock** to the
**imperial wannabes** in Washington, yielding much wailing and gnashing
of teeth]{.underline}. The Carnegie Endowment's Christopher S. Chivvis
and Jack Keating warn: "[**Historical precedents** from the 1930s and
the early Cold War suggest that **even deeper cooperation** among them
is possible and that a more coherent bloc determined to blunt and **roll
back U.S. power worldwide** might develop]{.underline}."

Of greatest concern is the relationship between Moscow and Beijing.
Robert D. Blackwill and Richard Fontaine, respectively with the Council
on Foreign Relations and Center for a New Security Policy, criticize
those who minimize the degree of cooperation: "[the **China-Russia
relationship** continues to deepen and widen]{.underline}, and
occasional disagreements are dwarfed by the scale and momentum of their
strategic cooperation. [Theirs is a formidable partnership bordering on
alliance, **bound together by resistance** to what they view as a
**U.S.-led, anachronistic international order**, one that **does not
permit** either country its **rightful place** despite their power,
history, domestic legitimacy, civilizational triumphs, and vital
regional interests]{.underline}."

Other analysts also paint the new "axis" as a dire threat. One could be
forgiven believing that America had been transported back to 1939 or
1956, on the verge of World War II or in the midst of the Cold War. A
Brookings Institution analysis published last month cited several
factors as "top threats to vital U.S. interests": supporting Russia
against Ukraine, challenging US hegemony in the Indo-Pacific, and
"weakening the underpinnings of American leadership on the world stage
and core elements of the existing rules-based international order." None
of these seem truly vital for a superpower that dominates its own
hemisphere and faces so few direct threats, but such is Washington's
almost pathological fear of any foreign challenge.

A Different Time, a Different View on Russia

Analysts once proposed conciliating Moscow. For instance, in 2021
Charles Kupchan of the Council on Foreign Relations opined that "as
Biden builds a coalition to tame Beijing, he also needs to work the
other side of the equation by weakening China's own international
partnerships. He can't stop China's rise, but he can limit its influence
by trying to lure away from China its main collaborator: Russia."

Kupchan urged Washington to help "Russia redress the vulnerabilities
that its relations with China put in stark relief." However, shortly
thereafter came the Ukraine crisis, ending serious support for engaging
Moscow. As the war dragged on the allied desire grew to convince Beijing
to break the partnership. Analysts similarly discussed strategies to use
the PRC to divide Russia and its other dubious associates, most
importantly North Korea.

Some analysts, such as the Atlantic Council's John Herbst, suggested
that Moscow is likely to drift back westward so no special concessions
to anyone are needed. Others urge a more active approach. For instance,
in October President Donald Trump declared: "the one thing you never
want to happen is you never want Russia and China uniting. I'm going to
have to un-unite them, and I think I can do that." However, he offered
no strategy or timeframe for playing a "reverse Nixon" on China and
Russia.

Whom to Ally With?

The idea of weakening the opposing coalition and even turning one of
Washington's chief antagonists into a minor partner is obviously
appealing. However, with whom should the US seek to effectively ally?

In 1972, China was the obvious counterweight to a much more dangerous
Soviet Union. No longer. While the Europeans want Beijing to stop aiding
Russia's war effort against Ukraine, virtually no one imagines a present
need for the West to align with the PRC against Russia, a declining
power. Even victory in Ukraine would leave Moscow weaker than before the
war began. Despite Europe's desperate nightmares of Putin conquering the
continent, there is little sign that Moscow possesses either the will or
the ability to take on NATO, let alone America.

Thus, today the PRC is widely recognized as the more threatening power.
Although China's continuing dramatic rise is no longer seen as quite so
inevitable, Beijing is likely to be an increasingly formidable adversary
in the future. Thus, the sensible objective would be to make Moscow a
partner and friend, if not an ally, of America and Europe. Alas, that
will be almost impossible so long as the Russo-Ukraine war rages and
will remain difficult even if the conflict ultimately settles, given the
severe damage done to US and European relations with Moscow.

In fact, [there is a dearth of will in Washington to improve
**relations** with either country]{.underline}. The [belief in America's
**virginal omnipotence**]{.underline} is bipartisan and overwhelming.
Hence, [compromise is widely regarded as **unthinkable**]{.underline}.
For instance, [Brookings insisted that]{.underline} "It would be
extremely misguided to try to win over one or both parties through
fundamental concessions, such as endorsing China's claims to Taiwan or
recognizing Russia's occupation of Ukrainian territories. [Such
appeasement would]{.underline} not only [undermine U.S.
**credibility**]{.underline} with its allies and partners but also
embolden China, Russia, and other revisionist regimes to engage in
further aggression."

Instead, the general Washington view is that the US should double down,
more strongly and effectively punishing both major "axis" members.
However, [Russia already has **weathered multiple rounds** of sanctions.
China's greater integration in the world economy gives the West more
retaliatory options, but the PRC also enjoys more commercial
partners]{.underline}. The Brookings commentary suggested that "A mix of
strategic and reputational costs, such as the threat of secondary
sanctions, as well as [**diplomatic incentives**, should be
employed]{.underline} to push Beijing to limit and constructively
leverage its ties with Russia." However, the PRC so far has maneuvered
carefully. Noted the Economist: "Taking advantage of Russia's
semi-isolation, China is buying its oil and gas at low prices, and will
soon pay for more of it with its non-convertible currency, the yuan.
Ever-cautious about its interests, China has avoided overt challenges to
Western sanctions."

Moreover, the cost of sustained economic war would be high for all and
the US would find little support for such a campaign in the Global South
and even among its own allies, especially in Asia. Moreover, [the West
**already is punishing Beijing** for other reasons---relations with
North Korea, threats against Taiwan, advances in critical technologies,
abuses of human rights, and more. The longer the list of American
sanctions, the more likely China is to **decouple than
concede**]{.underline}.

Blackwill and Fontaine would not only expand economic sanctions, but
also increase military outlays, seek new military partners, increase
military deployments, enhance military alliances, and up military aid.
All of these would raise tensions and likely push Beijing to respond
accordingly. Nor do the authors specify how to pay for their program
when the US government seems to be plunging toward insolvency---with
interest payments over \$1 trillion annually, annual deficits
approaching \$2 trillion a year, and the national debt at 100 percent of
GDP, headed for twice that by mid-century. There is little will to make
massive cuts in social welfare programs or to enact draconian tax hikes.

The Plan to Break the Axis

Even if Washington attempted to disrupt relations between China and
Russia, how could it do so?

Despite some tensions between the two, their relationship is much more
harmonious today than throughout much of their history. Nixon made his
move shortly after open border warfare between Russia and China. In
contrast, Observed Jo Inge Bekkevold of Norway's Institute for Defence
Studies: "by comparing today's Sino-Russian ties to the past Sino-Soviet
alignment along five key factors---geopolitics, economics, ideology,
leadership, and institutions---it becomes obvious that the
Beijing-Moscow axis is stronger today on all accounts."

Moreover, neither Beijing nor Moscow has reason to trust Washington. The
basic problem, noted Brookings, is that "[China and Russia's strategic
partnership will **persist** as long as each continues to see
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [as
its **principal adversary**. The]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [maintains a significant **trust deficit** with
both Beijing and Moscow which creates **challenges for bilateral
engagement**. Neither Beijing nor Moscow believes that they have
anything to gain by working with Washington to check the other's
influence." Who can blame them?]{.underline}

[Washington's policy toward both is **overtly hostile**]{.underline}.
The [Trump]{.underline} administration [would have to convince one or
both governments that turning westward served their
interests]{.underline}. Observed Chivvis and Keating: "What [these
states]{.underline} do [share is an **autocratic antipathy** for the
liberal aspects of the **U.S.-led order**, which they believe
**threatens their very existence**]{.underline}. This is important
because [**threat perceptions** play a key role in the formation of
alliances, blocs, and groups]{.underline}." How to reduce Beijing's
threat perceptions when Washington is unabashedly seeking to contain the
PRC militarily and economically, in effect treating it as a likely
enemy?

[Wrecking the NATO alliance Trump's hostility to alliances in general
and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in particular is a
matter of historical record]{.underline}. His hostility to NATO's
crucial mutual-defense clause (Article 5) --- requiring all signatories
to respond if one were attacked --- [could prove fatal. Just days after
his 2018 sycophantic summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, Fox News
host Tucker Carlson asked Trump, "Why should my son go to Montenegro to
defend it from attack?" Weighing his words with uncharacteristic care,
Trump replied: "I understand what you're saying. I've asked the same
question]{.underline}." He then offered what could, in a second term,
prove a virtual death sentence for NATO. "Montenegro," he said, "is a
tiny country with very strong people ... They're very aggressive people.
[They may get aggressive, and congratulations, you're in World War
Three." Since then, of course, Putin has invaded Ukraine and Biden's
White House has rallied NATO to defend that frontline European
state]{.underline}. Although Congress approved a massive \$111 billion
in aid (including \$67 billion in military aid) for Ukraine in the war's
first 18 months, the Republican-led House has recently stalled President
Biden's request for an additional \$67 billion critical to Kyiv's
continued resistance. [As the campaign for his party's nomination
gathers momentum, Trump's pro-Putin sentiments have helped persuade
Republican legislators to break with our NATO allies on this critical
issue]{.underline}. Keep in mind that, right after Russia invaded in
February 2022, Trump labeled Putin's move "genius," adding, "I mean,
he's taking over a country for \$2 worth of sanctions. I'd say that's
pretty smart." Last September, after Putin thanked him for claiming
that, were he still president, he could end the war in 24 hours, Trump
assured Meet the Press: "I would get him into a room. I'd get Zelensky
into a room. Then I'd bring them together. And I'd have a deal worked
out."

In reality, a reelected Trump would undoubtedly simply abandon Ukraine,
at best forcing it into negotiations that would be tantamount to
surrender. As formerly neutral nations Finland and Sweden have rallied
to NATO and alliance stalwarts like Britain and Germany make major arms
deliveries to Ukraine, Europe has clearly labeled Russia's invasion and
war an existential threat. Under such circumstances, a future Trump tilt
toward Putin could swing a wrecking ball through the NATO alliance,
which, for the past 75 years, has served as a singular pillar in the
architecture of US global power. Alienating allies on the Pacific
littoral Just as NATO has long served as a strategic pillar at the
western end of the vast Eurasian landmass, so four bilateral alliances
along the Pacific littoral from Japan to the Philippines have proven a
geopolitical fulcrum for dominance over the eastern end of Eurasia and
the defense of North America. Here, the record of the first Trump
administration was, at best, mixed. On the credit side of history's
ledger, he did revive "the Quad," a loose alliance with Australia, India
and Japan, which has gained greater coherence under President Biden. But
only time spared Trump's overall Asian diplomacy from utter disaster.
His obsessive personal courtship of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un,
marked by two meaningless meetings and the exchange of 27 mash notes,
failed to produce any sign of Pyongyang's (nuclear) disarmament, while
weakening America's alliance with long-standing ally South Korea.
Although Japan's prime minister obsequiously paid court to Trump, he
battered that classic bilateral alliance with constant complaints about
its cost, even slapping a punitive 25% duty on Japanese steel imports.

[Ignoring the pleas of close Asian allies, Trump also canceled the
Trans-Pacific Partnership, leaving the door open for China to conclude
its own Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership with 15 Asia-Pacific
countries that now account for nearly a third of Beijing's foreign
trade. Another four years of Trump's "America first" diplomacy in the
Pacific could do irreparable damage to those key strategic
alliances]{.underline}. Further south, by using Taiwan to both confront
and court Chinese President Xi Jinping, while letting the Philippines
drift toward Beijing's orbit and launching a misbegotten trade war with
China, [Trump's version of Asian "diplomacy" allowed Beijing to make
some real diplomatic, economic, and military gains, while distinctly
weakening the American position in the region. Biden, by contrast, has
at least partially restored it, a strengthening reflected in a
surprisingly amicable San Francisco summit last November with President
Xi]{.underline}. In South Asia, where the bitter rivalry between India
and Pakistan dominates all diplomacy, Trump trashed a 70-year military
alliance with Pakistan with a single New Year's Day message. "[The
United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars
in aid over the last 15 years]{.underline}," Trump tweeted, "and they
have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as
fools ... No more!" Since then, Pakistan has shifted decisively into
Beijing's orbit, while India now plays Moscow and Washington off against
each other to its economic advantage. Just as Trump's posture toward
Europe could swing a wrecking ball through the NATO alliance in a second
term, so his mix of economic nationalism and strategic myopia could
destabilize the array of alliances along the Pacific littoral, toppling
that second of Brzezinski's three pillars for American global power.

That "assertive single entity" in Central Asia And when it comes to that
third pillar of US global power --- [preventing any "assertive single
entity" from controlling the "middle space" of Eurasia --- Trump failed
woefully (as, in fact, had his predecessors). After announcing China's
trillion-dollar Belt & Road Initiative in 2013, President Xi has spent
billions building a steel grid of roads, rails, and pipelines that
crisscross the middle space of that vast Eurasian landmass, an enormous
new infrastructure that has led to a chain of alliances stretching
across central Asia]{.underline}. The power of China's position was
manifested in 2021 when Beijing helped push the US military out of
Afghanistan in a deft geopolitical squeeze-play. [More recently, Beijing
also brokered a breathtaking diplomatic entente between Shi'a Iran and
Sunni Saudi Arabia, stunning Washington and many Western diplomats.
Trump's Middle East policy during his first term in office was focused
solely on backing right-wing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu]{.underline} --- recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital,
canceling a nuclear agreement with Iran, seconding his marginalization
of the Palestinians, and promoting Arab recognition of Israel. Since the
Hamas terrorist attack of October 7 and Netanyahu's devastating assault
on Gaza's civilian population, President Biden's reaction was skewed in
an almost Trumpian fashion toward Israel, with a consequent loss of
influence in the wider region. And count on one thing: An incoming Trump
administration would only compound the damage. In short, Beijing is
already toppling the third pillar of American global power in that
critical "middle space" of Eurasia. In a second Trump term, an unchecked
Chinese diplomatic and economic juggernaut could arguably grind that
pillar into rubble. Africa in the "World Island" In fact, however, no
matter what Brzezinski might have thought, there are other pillars of
world power beyond Eurasia --- above all, Africa. Indeed, British
geostrategist Halford Mackinder, the author of the global geopolitical
analysis that deeply influenced the former national security adviser,
argued over a century ago that the locus of global power lay in a
tri-continental combination of Europe, Asia, and Africa that he dubbed
"the world island."

[In the age of high imperialism, Europe found Africa a fertile field for
colonial exploitation and, during the Cold War, Washington added to that
continent's suffering by making it a superpower surrogate battleground.
But Beijing grasped the human potential of Africa and, in the 1970s,
began building lasting economic alliances with its emerging nations. By
2015, its trade with Africa had climbed to \$222 billion, three times
the United States']{.underline}. Its investments there were then
projected to reach a trillion dollars by 2025. Recognizing the strategic
threat, [President Barack Obama convened a 2014 summit with 51 African
leaders at the White House. Trump, however, dismissed the entire
continent, during a 2018 Oval Office meeting, as so many "shithole
countries]{.underline}." The Trump administration tried to repair the
damage by sending First Lady Melania off on a solo trip to Africa, but
her bizarre colonial outfits and ill-timed administration cuts in
foreign aid to the continent only added to the damage. In addition to a
storehouse of natural resources, Africa's chief asset is its growing
pool of human talent. Africa's median age is 19 (compared to 38 for both
China and the US), meaning that, by 2050, that continent will be home to
a full one-third of the world's young. Given his fraught record with the
region, [Trump's second term would likely do little more than hand the
whole continent to China on a gold-plated platter. South of the border
Even in Latin America, the situation has been changing in a complex
fashion]{.underline}.

As a region [informally incorporated into the American imperium for more
than a century and suffering all the slights of an asymmetric
alliance]{.underline}, its increasingly nationalist leaders welcomed
China's interest in this century. By 2017, in fact, Chinese trade with
Latin America had hit a substantial \$244 billion, making it --- yes!
--- the region's largest trading partner. [Simultaneously, Beijing's
loans to Caribbean countries had reached a hefty \$62 billion by the end
of the Trump administration. Except for drug interdiction and economic
sanctions against leftist regimes in Cuba and Venezuela, the Trump White
House generally ignored Latin America, doing nothing to slow China's
commercial juggernaut]{.underline}. Although the Biden administration
made some diplomatic gestures toward the region, China's trade rose
relentlessly to \$450 billion by 2022. Reflecting a bipartisan
indifference in this century, a reelected [Trump would likely do little
to check China's growing commercial hegemony over Latin
America]{.underline}. And the region would undoubtedly welcome such
indifference, since the alternative --- along with draconian moves at
the US--Mexican border --- [might involve plans to fire missiles at or
send troops to knock out drug labs in Mexico. The backlash to such
unilateral intervention amid panic over immigration could cripple US
relations with the region for decades to come]{.underline}.

[A unipolar world can also be highly unstable. This is because the
hegemonic status of one state can encourage dangerous resentment among
emerging powers. Waltz argues that because states are security-
maximisers, in their attempts to protect themselves, they will feel
constrained by another power's claims to global hegemony]{.underline}.
This will be [particularly dangerous and destabilising when a hegemon is
declining in power and influence. Such a state of affairs has been
referred to as power transition and can make international relations
extremely volatile]{.underline}.

It has been [argued that this provoked the First World War, since a
rapidly growing Germany, emboldened by British failures in the Boer War,
decided to challenge what had been the hegemonic status of Great
Britain]{.underline}. According to this principle, US hegemony
encouraged stability, so long as her position was unrivalled. [However,
the US's failure to achieve its objectives in either Afghanistan or
Iraq, followed by the collapse of the US bank Lehman Brothers, has more
recently highlighted US military and economic weakness, so undermining
the US's claims to global leadership]{.underline}. The attitude of
emerging powers towards the existing hegemon is therefore vital. If the
hegemon is resented and emerging states decide that they can achieve
more by challenging it, this can create the environment for
destabilising power transition.

[Until recently, for example, China has been prepared to accept US
hegemony. However, its increasing assertiveness in its 'near abroad',
represented by its building of reefs in the South China Sea in defiance
of US-led regional condemnation, suggests that it feels able to
challenge US dominance]{.underline}. Equally, the Russian annexation of
Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 in defiance of an onslaught of Western
criticism indicates that Russia may also begin to probe US weakness.
[The way in which President Barack Obama also refused to provide global
leadership during the Arab Spring and then stood by as Russia militarily
intervened in Syria on behalf of President Assad further suggests the
limitations of US power]{.underline}.

Trump 2.0: The return unfiltered hegemony

[Through its numerous statements and decisions, the **Trump
administration is breaking with the liberal hegemony** that has
structured the international order for decades.]{.underline}

[In its place, **a more authoritarian, unilateral stance is emerging**,
close to what researchers call classic hegemony. This change is clear
enough that some analysts consider certain developments
worrisome.]{.underline}

Olivier Schmitt, professor and specialist of alliances at the Royal
Danish Defence College, [raised the possibility a few months ago of a
**"Warsawization" of NATO**, a scenario in which Washington would
transform the organization into a kind of counterpart to the Warsaw
Pact, with a rigid and asymmetrical structure based on fear rather than
co-operation.]{.underline}

President Donald Trump talks with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at
the White House in March 2025. (Pool via AP)

[This return to a form of coercive hegemony is problematic because it's
based on a very short-term view of international relations.]{.underline}

Unlike China or Russia, which both apply a form of authoritarian
hegemony but with a certain strategic consistency and predictability[,
the Trump administration acts as if international relations were a
non-iterative game, in the sense of game theory --- in other words, a
game in which refusing to co-operate is the most winning
strategy.]{.underline}

[It adopts a strategy where each move is played without concern for
future retaliation or the long-term impact on its reputation. However,
other countries and partners remember and adjust their behaviour based
on precedents.]{.underline}

By acting in this way, the U.S. projects the image of an opportunistic
and unstable entity whose commitments no longer have lasting value.
[**This change in posture erodes trust** and undermines the stabilizing
role that the U.S. had once successfully embodied.]{.underline}

[Uncertainty that fuels mistrust]{.underline}

[Europe and some of its partners are embarking on what looks like a new
"western schism," positioning themselves as a liberal counter-model to
Trump's America]{.underline}. But the outcome of this dynamic will
largely depend on the ability of Europeans to be agents of change rather
than mere spectators.

Nevertheless, the conditions are now in place for the emergence of
genuine counter-hegemonies. [This dynamic will continue even if the
Democrats return to power in 2029: the Trumpist interlude will have
provided America's allies with proof that an alliance with the U.S. is
only reliable when the White House is Democratic, and that it
immediately becomes precarious as soon as a Republican occupies
it.]{.underline}

[This uncertainty will fuel mistrust and **push for the consolidation of
counter-hegemonic strategies**. Even a partial restoration of the
liberal order will probably not be enough to stem the fragmentation of
the international system that is already underway.]{.underline}

Furthermore, it should be noted that the Trump administration is only
just beginning its term: unless there is a reversal in the midterm
elections in November 2026, it will still have considerable margin for
manoeuvre until January 2029. In other words, [the current trajectory is
likely to continue.]{.underline}

In this sense, [Trump's second term does not simply mark a shift, but a
lasting break]{.underline}. The slogan "Make America Great Again" now
seems even more misguided: instead of restoring American power, this
policy is accelerating its decline.

[[The U.S. **political**]{.mark} system was [established for
**governing** largely **autonomous** states]{.mark} through a
decentralized **[federation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. At the same time,
the [country was not [expected to pursue **expansionist**]{.mark}
foreign [policy]{.mark}]{.underline}. Isolationism has long been the
[[main direction of U.S. **foreign** policy]{.underline}]{.mark}. Today,
the majority of the [[**population** remains uninterested in
**external** events]{.underline}]{.mark}---and the US media pay them
relatively little attention.

Before the Civil War, the country did not have a powerful military. The
U.S. economic power, their involvement in world wars, the need to govern
defeated and occupied countries, and to oppose the USSR, as well as the
development of the tax system and the growth of social programs---these
factors and many others brought to life the unprecedented power of the
military--industrial complex and sharply strengthened the role and power
of the state apparatus. The United States of America has become the
world's largest empire, with hundreds of military bases around the
world, influencing dozens of countries and leading world organizations
to some extent, keeping many thousands of politicians and activists,
journalists, businessmen, and others "on the hook."
[**[However]{.mark}**, their [political **system**]{.mark} has not been
sufficiently **[reconstructed]{.mark}** (and could not be reconstructed)
to [**meet** these challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}. In his book The Next
Decade, George Friedman in his forecast for 2011--2021 stated that he
had some grounds to call America "an accidental empire" (Friedman,
Citation2011, Ch. 1) and to predict that the U[.S. would face the
consequences of its [**transformation** into an **empire**]{.mark} in
this decade]{.underline}. This political analyst brings forth deep and
extraordinary problems, although many of his predictions have not come
true. The point is that the United States is, de facto, [an
**[empire]{.mark}**, and governing this empire is the [most important
**challenge**]{.mark} facing this country. But its [political structure
is **archaic** and **unfit** to **govern**]{.mark} the [world
rationally]{.mark}]{.underline}. As a result, the desire of the U.S. for
world domination undermines the republic (Ibid.). [Friedman raises
important questions: Is it [**possible** to **reconcile** governing the
empire with the demands of the republic]{.mark}]{.underline}? Will the
republic survive under the [[conditions of the imperial
**situation**]{.underline}]{.mark}? Will the republic pass through the
mistakes of governing the empire? (Ibid.).

We may conclude that the [Republic and the **[democracy]{.mark}**
underlying the U.S. political system **[contradict]{.mark}** its
**[imperial position]{.mark}**. This **[contradiction]{.mark}** is not
superficial, but **[systemic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The republic and
democratic values will be increasingly engaged in
**[confrontation]{.underline}** with the empire; thus, since the United
States cannot **[renounce]{.underline}** either the republic or the
empire, these factors will greatly and unexpectedly influence political
processes in the United States and negatively propagate throughout the
world.

Within domestic [**[policy]{.mark}**, the president "**[bumps]{.mark}**"
into the system of [checks]{.mark} and [balances]{.mark}
established]{.underline} 250 years ago, a constitution that cannot be
changed, and **[[characteristics]{.underline}]{.mark}** of its political
party system. But [**[foreign]{.mark}** policy, for the most part, is
the prerogative of the institution of the presidency]{.underline}. There
are almost no [legislative rules that **[regulate]{.mark}** foreign
policy]{.underline}---and yet the United States holds near-absolute
power in the world. [As a **[result]{.mark}**, the empire is governed by
the **[president]{.mark}**, subject to the influence of the
military--industrial complex and lobbyists]{.underline}, as well as
various secret services (e.g., the CIA and NSA), and, as has been
already mentioned, [depends to a **[large]{.mark}** extent on current
internal political forces]{.underline}. Hence, it follows that every new
president can change foreign policy and, as [**[Trump\'s]{.mark}**
example has shown]{.underline}, very radically and even unpredictably,
whereas arrangements with other countries are rejected as useless.
Nevertheless, George Friedman, who called for strengthening the external
power of the United States, recognized that the president should govern
the U.S. empire in a manner that conceals the real directions of the
U.S. hegemony from the population. President Trump acts in exactly this
way, justifying all his foreign policy actions by trying to solve
internal problems and address internal tasks. As a result, chaos and
tension are growing in the World System.

[Thus, there is a disproportion between **[imperial ambitions]{.mark}**
and **[obligations]{.mark}** on one hand, and the
**[vulnerability]{.mark}** of being able to fulfill these obligations
due to characteristics of the political system and [American
**democracy**]{.mark} on the other]{.underline}.

### Impact\-\--AT: LIO\-\--2NC

#### The LIO is doing find even with Trump -- the plan can bolster

**Poast 7/11** (Paul Poast, associate professor in the Department of
Political Science at the University of Chicago, where his area of
research and teaching is international relations, Deputy Dean for
Doctoral Education- 7-11-2025, \"The Liberal International Order Is No
Better or Worse Under Trump\", World Politics Review,
<https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/trump-rules-based-order/>); LF

In the six months since U.S. President Donald Trump returned to the
White House, some observers have worried that he is seeking to dismantle
the postwar international order. The view is that, whether one calls
that order "liberal international" or "rules-based," Trump has little
tolerance for either liberalism or rules, so he will have no inclination
to support it. Some analysts, such as Anne Applebaum, have gone further,
asserting that Trump is aligning with Russian President Vladimir Putin
to take down not just Ukraine, but the U.S.-led international system.

[If such a dismantling were taking place, we would have expected to see
some indication of it over the past month, when the G7 and NATO held
their annual leaders' summits in Alberta, Canada, and The Hague,
Netherlands, respectively. On the basis of those gatherings, however,
**we can say that the international order is, to the contrary, doing
just fine. Not great. Not optimal. But fine.**]{.underline}

The G7 and NATO are far from the only international institutions and
treaties that comprise the post-1945 international order. Moreover, the
BRICS grouping, whose annual meeting took place this past week, is
positioning itself as an alternative to those Western-centric
institutions. [But the G7 and NATO are meaningful to the Western nations
that have long comprised the core of the international
order.]{.underline} Gaining membership to either club signifies status,
and being cast out of either one, as Russia was in 2014 when the G8
returned to being the G7, comes with major reputational costs. And from
the economic policy coordination pursued through the G7 summits to the
mutual defense affirmations expressed at the NATO meetings, [the
meetings have long served as annual litmus tests of the international
order's overall health.]{.underline}

[As noted above, this year's meetings were especially important, as they
offered a first look into how Trump---a known skeptic of the very idea
of alliances---currently sees these U.S.-led groupings. The results are,
to put it mildly, encouraging.]{.underline}

[Let's start with the NATO summit in late June in The Hague, where Trump
seemed willing to follow the political script required to make it a
success.]{.underline} For instance, when asked at a press conference
with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte if he valued NATO's Article 5
mutual defense provision, Trump responded, "That's why I'm here."
[Although in an earlier press gathering on Air Force One while flying to
The Hague he had stated that his commitment to Article 5 depended on how
one defined it, that's hardly controversial. As I pointed out in a
previous column, the actual mutual defense commitment expressed by
Article 5 is vague and intended to allow NATO members flexibility in the
type of support they provide in the event one of the allies is
attacked.]{.underline}

[Of course, Trump's newfound taste for the alliance was helped along by
the "royal treatment" he received from his Dutch hosts, the ingratiating
comments made by Rutte himself and the fact that the summit was kept to
a single day to accommodate his famously short attention
span.]{.underline} [Most importantly, all the NATO allies except Spain
signed onto a commitment to raise their defense spending levels to 5
percent of GDP, rather than simply "aim for" the target of 2 percent of
GDP, as they had pledged to do at the alliance's 2014 summit in Wales.
And just as importantly, they were all happy to let Trump take the
credit for the deal.]{.underline}

Of course, not all is well with the liberal international order. But one
must also ask how well it was doing prior to Trump's return.

But Trump's attitude toward NATO seemed to have really changed in The
Hague. [On the trip back to Washington, he told reporters, "I left here
differently. I left here saying, 'These people really love their
countries. It's not a rip-off.' And we are here to help them protect
their country."]{.underline}

Another notable change in Trump's understanding of European security is
his gradual realization that Putin does not appear interested in
pursuing peace in Ukraine. In fact, that intransigence is now causing
Trump to grow frustrated with his Russian counterpart. So while some
observers expressed alarm over a pause in U.S. deliveries of air defense
munitions to Ukraine last week---purportedly to reassess dwindling U.S.
stocks, an issue that has plagued the U.S. military for well over a
year---[assistance to Kyiv was quickly restored once Trump learned of
the decision, which he was apparently not apprised of ahead of time. In
short, it seems that many of the worst fears about Trump abandoning
Europe that were expressed in the early months of his term are not
coming to pass.]{.underline}

The G7 meeting that preceded the NATO summit in mid-June did not end on
quite as positive a note, with Trump leaving early in order to address
what was then the still-unfolding war between Israel and Iran. Nor did
the leaders issue the traditional joint communique at the summit's end.
But there were also a number of positives, including the signing of
joint policy statements on issues ranging from critical minerals to
migrant smuggling.

**[All in all, then, the sequence of back-to-back successful summits
among the core Western states of the liberal international order is a
positive sign.]{.underline}**

Of course, not all is well with that order. [Trump has cut U.S. foreign
aid and shuttered the U.S. Agency for International Development, or
USAID. He has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement that sought to reverse
the emissions contributing to climate change. Trump's tariffs continue
to strain relations between the U.S. and its allies, while threatening
the smooth operation of the global economy. But the full imposition of
those tariffs continues to be pushed back to later dates. That, too,
points to how much one must separate the bluster from the substance of
Trump's approach to foreign policy. It's part of his penchant for being
predictably unpredictable.]{.underline}

**[But one must also ask how well the international order was doing
prior to Trump's return.]{.underline}** Even if unintentionally, former
President Joe Biden revealed the hypocrisy at the heart of that order,
when he praised and criticized the International Criminal Court
depending not on how, but against whom it brought indictments. [Before
him, despite positive achievements such as the New START arms control
agreement with Russia and the Iran nuclear deal, former President Barack
Obama can also be seen as having failed to uphold the pillars of the
liberal international order.]{.underline} Examples range from drone
strike assassinations and the intervention in Libya, which was roundly
criticized for undermining international law's core norm of
non-intervention, to his failure to uphold his own "red lines" when the
now-overthrown regime of then-Syrian President Bashar al-Assad used
chemical weapons against its own people.

[In reality, the rules of the rules-based order have always been more
like guidelines than hard and fast obligations, especially for the major
powers. And the U.S. has long strongarmed allies to get its way, even if
Trump takes that approach to extremes.]{.underline} [In that sense,
**the liberal international order today is largely how it's always been:
Neither good nor bad, but fine.**]{.underline} Trump hasn't changed
that---yet.

The Current Power Transition Our tendency to focus on "unipolarity"
[occludes the degree that hegemony in the 1990s was essentially
exercised by a great-power cartel,]{.underline} made up largely of
members of the G7. By the later 1990s, [the "liberal international
order" rested on two large federations---the United States and the
European Union---and their outsized economic power.]{.underline} Even if
the U.S. was really the "indispensable nation," that was only the case
because practically every other great power in the world was deeply
embedded in the American security system, anchored by NATO and the
U.S.-Japan bilateral alliance. [Most of those great powers could have
formed the backbone of a counterbalancing coalition. Instead, they chose
to remain part of an informal confederation led by the United
States.]{.underline}

68

What they also did was form a more or less united front on the provision
of international goods, especially development assistance. While their
regulatory regimes, internationalized via their market power, differed
in many ways, the U.S. and its allies generally committed themselves to
fostering an open international economy. [In consequence, the "liberal
international order" was, more or less, the only game in
town.]{.underline} Governments looking for economic goods, credible
security guarantees, or even seeking to improve their international
standing had little choice but to accept "western" conditions and
expectations. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the "triumph" of
market democracy also, for a time, lent substantial prestige to the
"liberal international order."

None of this meant that the G7 cartel always got what it wanted. [States
with highly specific assets could still escape much of this
pressure.]{.underline} [This was true of some of the most important
players in the Middle East, who benefited from some combination of large
petroleum reserves and, for example, U.S. national security priorities.
Oil wealth also positioned states in the region---namely Saudi Arabia,
Qatar, and, with some caveats, Iran---among the few sources of
alternative international patronage.]{.underline} And while the Gulf
States sometimes provided assistance to forces hostile to the United
States---and supported rival sides in conflicts---[they also chose to
remain within the U.S. alliance system rather than to balance against
it.]{.underline}

[The 'western' patronage quasi-monopoly was never going to last. The
idea, as noted above, was to shape rising powers such that they would
eventually become sources of liberal ordering in their own right.
Instead, **many of them developed strategies and tactics for resisting
liberalizing forces**; they learned how to turn digital communications
technologies to their advantage. **They now use these strategies to
undermine western democracies.** Other authoritarian regimes and
aspiring autocrats borrow --- or outright purchase --- their playbook.
And, of course, firms in the United States, Europe, Israel, and
elsewhere are more than happy to grab a share of the domestic repression
market.]{.underline}

[The overwhelming consensus in Washington policy circles is that
"**enlargement" was on balance a failure.**]{.underline} [Over the last
fifteen years, **China has become more, not less, authoritarian**.
**Russia is no longer a democracy, and it seeks to actively undermine
liberal democracy overseas.**]{.underline} The G7's share of global GDP
has fallen dramatically, [while China---and to a lesser extent

The Gaza conflict, which has destabilized, and killed tens of thousands
in the Levant, occurred in a context of a broader crisis of liberal
international order (which is mirrored by a crisis of democracy within
Israel and in the United States). It has possibly accelerated that
crisis: to the extent that it affected the outcome of the 2024 U.S.
election, [appears to have given Netanyahu a new lease on life, resulted
in a crippling blow to Palestinian self determination, and convinced
many of the hollowness of liberal order.]{.underline} There might be a
bitter irony in that. The Oslo Accords represented the apex of the U.S.
postCold War liberal project in the United States (Iraq was a very
different kind of "liberal" project). [The Biden administration hoped to
resurrect the accords, just as it hoped to restore liberal order.
Instead, it midwifed the likely end of both.]{.underline}

Mark Beeson urges the international community to organise a collective
response to America's unilateralism.

For nearly eighty years we have been accustomed to the United States
playing what former Secretary of State Madelaine Albright described as
an 'indispensable' role in international affairs. As far as most
Americans and allied states were concerned this was overwhelmingly seen
as a good thing. **[Yet claims about the benign, stability-enhancing
nature of American hegemony always looked rather implausible, selective
and overblown. In the wake of the US's illegal attack on Iran, they look
absurd.]{.underline}**

[For policymakers who grew up in an era of American economic and
strategic dominance, however, it is almost impossible to imagine
anything different. Unfortunately for them, they may have to: **the old
order is being disassembled before their eyes.**]{.underline} Even for
the truest of believers, these are testing times. Never has Gramsci's
famous aphorism about the old world dying looked more appropriate,
except that the new order has not even been conceived, let alone
struggled to be born.

[Far from being an anchor of stability, the United States has become a
source of chaos and unpredictability, both at home and abroad. This has
become **especially evident under the erratic leadership of Donald
Trump**, but he may be a symptom as much as a cause.]{.underline} As the
Cold War ended and an era of apparent peace and progress beckoned, James
Rosenau explained why 'turbulence' was likely to be a continuing feature
of world politics in a book that looks rather prescient in retrospect.

But American foreign and strategic policy can minimise or accentuate the
upheavals. In the period after World War 2, it played a stabilising
role, that was generally accepted and even welcomed, especially by
recipients of the Marshall Plan. Under the Trump administration, even
supposed friends and allies are having to rapidly adjust to the
implications of America first. Ingratiation does not look like a viable
or sustainable strategy.

The way we were

While history is replete with unlearned lessons, especially about the
futility of war, there are also moments of cooperation and enlightened
leadership that suggest other paths are possible. If there is one thing
we can agree on at present, perhaps, it's that our present collective
trajectory might be delicately described as sub-optimal, not least
because of the actions of the world's most powerful country.

[The impact of American hegemony hasn't **always** been so
destructive]{.underline}, however. On the contrary, in the aftermath of
World War 2, the US played a truly indispensable role in shaping a post
war order from which many benefitted. True, the principal beneficiaries
were primarily the core economies of industrialised Europe and Japan,
but this shouldn't blind us to the scale of what was an unprecedented
achievement.

Not only did the Americans facilitate and actively support the
reconstruction of some of its former enemies, but its actions eventually
led to the creation of what is now the European Union; arguably the most
effective expression of institutionalised transnational cooperation the
world has ever seen. The EU is far from perfect, but like the United
Nations, which also emerged at this time, it's the best we've managed
collectively so far.

Even in Japan, American influence helped to entrench both democracy and
a revulsion of militarism. Japan also became the foundation of the 'East
Asian miracle' that did so much to stabilise a region formerly
synonymous with conflict and distrust. It is testimony to how much has
changed, that Japan, South Korea and other US allies are being
encouraged to increase defence spending, as are the 'freeloading
Europeans', of course.

It is entirely possible that Trump's belief that the EU was created to
'screw' America is simply a reflection of his boundless ignorance. He
may also not realise that part of America's enlightened self-interest
flowed from the existence of the Cold War's bipolar order: the Soviet
Union represented a formidable strategic opponent, and even a role model
for many of the global south who still bore the scars of capitalism's
collapse during the Great Depression. Cooperating to save both democracy
and capitalism seemed like a good idea.

Indeed, one of the great lessons of the interwar period and its
aftermath, according to Charles Kindleberger's influential analysis was
that economic - and by implication strategic stability -- requires
enlightened leadership and the provision of vital public goods, such as
an open international economy, a stable currency regime and a market of
last resort. It is hard to imagine anything less like the economic
policies and thinking of Trump and his coterie of advisors and flunkies,
some of whom really ought to know better.

[The way we are now]{.underline}

[It is difficult to overstate quite **how different the world now looks
now.**]{.underline} While the [US remains the world's most powerful
strategic and economic actor, it is being challenged by a **genuine peer
competitor** in the form of China, which wasn't on the geopolitical
radar eighty years ago.]{.underline} Even more remarkably, perhaps, the
Soviet Union has not simply disappeared as a balancing force with which
American policymakers must reckon, but Trump has an unfathomable
admiration for Vladamir Putin.

It\'s important to remember that it didn't have to be this way. The end
of the Cold War offered a real opportunity to draw Russia into the
'international community' and ease the trauma of imperial collapse.
Instead, it suffered economic 'shock therapy', which infamously
contained too much of the former and not enough of the latter. The
result was the creation of powerful oligarchs and the emergence of
Putin, who was and is determined to avenge Russia's humiliation.

And yet, the end of the Cold War really did offer the proverbial window
of historical opportunity, which Bill Clinton squandered. True, Clinton
recognised that globalisation opened up new opportunities for American
capital, but he also took the opportunity to expand NATO to Russia's
borders while it was in no position to resist.

[**The temptations of unipolarity are also difficult to resist**,
especially when they are championed by influential ideologues or
supported by pliant allies. George W. Bush's decision to invade Iraq is
one of the greatest unforced strategic errors in history and ought to
have been a **sobering illustration** of the limits of what even the
greatest powers can achieve.]{.underline} If the Trump administration is
incapable of realising this, all the more reason to try and inject some
'balance' into an international order that is rapidly spinning out of
control.

[Given that **'**realist' thinkers have arguably got us to where we are
now -- facing the prospect of **endless wars, unwinnable geoeconomic
competition, and an unaddressed climate catastrophe** -- I'm reluctant
to draw on their supposed expertise for solutions to problems they were
instrumental in creating. But as realists might say, we have to deal
with the world as it is, not as we would like it to be.]{.underline}

The way we could be

One of the key ideas of the realist world view is that [it's vital to
ensure that no state becomes so powerful that it dominates the
international order in which all states are embedded.]{.underline} The
seminal case study of this -- very effective -- principle in action was
the [Concert of Europe]{.underline}, which emerged in the aftermath of
the Napoleonic wars in the 19th century. Collective security was
underpinned by cooperation against a dangerous, potentially
destabilising hegemonic power.

Trump's disdain for European attempts to resolve the war between Iran
and Israel through diplomacy was evident before the attack on Iran.
Trump has little interest in collective efforts to solve international
conflicts, and his unilateral actions will only aid autocrats like
Netanyahu and Putin. [Europeans have recognised that the US is an
unreliable partner and are increasing defence spending as a result.
Whether this is a cause for celebration is another
question.]{.underline}

Either way, if the sight of tens of thousands of Palestinian women and
children being slaughtered isn't enough to jolt the 'international
community' into action, perhaps economic self-interest will be. The
Trump administration has shown little regard about or understanding of
the economic damage its punitive tariffs, exploding debt levels and
undermining of the dollar is doing to other countries, or even the US
itself. The next crisis of capitalism cannot be far off.

Governments that attempt to ingratiate themselves with Trump are on a
fool's errand: giving in to bullying only encourages more of the same.
If the US doesn't want to be part of liberal economic order it helped to
create, **[other countries should pick up the mantle.]{.underline}**
[There are already successful examples of trade agreements that do not
include the US]{.underline}, such as the Asia-Pacific's Regional
Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which accounts for 30% of the
world's population and GDP.

A 'coalition of the concerned' would likely attract even more potential
partners and would be an infinitely preferable way of sending the US a
message than the realist reliance on power politics underpinned by
military might. The only other countries likely to object to such a
coalition are Israel and Russia, which tells us something about the
nature of contemporary American diplomacy and strategic policy.

Simply trying to organise a collective response to America's destructive
unilateralism might be enough to make the Trump administration think
twice about its actions. [It might also help the famously self-absorbed
population of the US to recognise that **much of the world doesn't share
their opinion about America's manifest destiny and the supposed benefits
of its primacy.**]{.underline}

Americans might even consider how their own country became hostage to
the whims of a megalomaniacal, narcissistic autocrat. We must encourage
them to use their celebrated checks and balances before they disappear
for ever and their own country descends into violence.

Here's something most Americans may be surprised to hear: [**military
[strategists]{.mark}** in the **United States** [consider **China**
the]{.mark} nation's [**main** military
**worry**]{.mark}]{.underline}---with the distinct [[**possibility** of
a major]{.mark} **U.S.-China [war]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the years to
come. That is a terrifying prospect. The two countries are the world's
[top two **economic** and **military** powers, both [**armed** with
**nuclear weapons**]{.mark}]{.underline}, each contributing 15% to 20%
to world gross domestic product, and each dependent on the other for its
prosperity given the depth and breadth of their economic relationships.
[Were they to go to **war**, however]{.underline}, global
**[prosperity]{.underline}** might soon [become the **least**
of]{.underline} our [concerns; **[World War III]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[]{.mark}could not be ruled out, [and the [**survival** of the **human
race**]{.mark}]{.underline} might even be **[[on the
line]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

A quick word of partial reassurance: I think that American military
strategists tend to be, on average, slightly too hawkish on China, a
country that some are calling part of a ["new **[axis of evil]{.mark}**"
that also **[includes Russia]{.mark}**, **[No]{.mark}rth
[Ko]{.mark}rea**, and **[Iran]{.mark}**.]{.underline} I might agree that
the latter three nations, or at least their current leaderships, should
be viewed as fundamentally malevolent and dangerous. But China is a more
complex case, having brought hundreds of millions of people out of
poverty **[[in recent decades]{.underline}]{.mark}**, having [[done
**much** for]{.mark} **economic [growth]{.mark}**]{.underline} around
the world in general, and [[showing a **certain aversion** to military
risk]{.underline}]{.mark} (it has not gone to war since 1979, though it
has skirmished against India and the Philippines in recent times).
Perhaps military strategists are seeing things too darkly, even as they
[rightly **sound the alarm** on]{.underline} some of [[China's]{.mark}
**behaviors** as]{.underline} [well as its **[growing
capacities]{.mark}** and the **ensuing [risks]{.mark}** [to American
**interests**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This backgrounder sketches out three
different ways in which war pitting the People's Republic of China
against the United States (and some number of its allies) might break
out1:

Over disputed islets and waters in the Western Pacific.

With a Chinese attempt to invade and conquer Taiwan, a polity of 23
million people that Beijing considers a renegade province, followed by a
U.S. decision to come to Taiwan's aid.

With a more limited use of Chinese force against Taiwan, most likely
involving some type of blockade of the island in an attempt to strangle
and coerce it into capitulation and reunification.

I find the first scenario the most likely to erupt, but the least likely
to lead to all-out war. The last scenario causes me the greatest angst,
based on a combined sense of its likelihood together with its potential
for escalation both in the likely geographic zone of conflict and the
potential use of nuclear weapons.

[[**Limited war** in]{.mark} the **Pacific**: [The **S**]{.mark}**outh
[C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea**]{.underline}

One set of scenarios has become all too plausible in recent years: a
skirmish between the Philippines and China as they pursue competing
claims to certain islands, rocks, and other generally inconsequential
features in the South China Sea. The problem is that ownership of even
rather small islands can provide land for military bases, while also
conferring large territorial seas and exclusive economic zones to the
country able to establish possession. On top of that,
**[China]{.underline}** seems to [want to [control **ship
movements**]{.mark} throughout the **entire South China
Sea**]{.underline}, or at least maintain the right to veto those it
doesn't like (such as those involving American aircraft carriers). A
land formation called the Second Thomas Shoal is the most acute problem
now; Manila (the capital of the Philippines) deliberately stranded an
old ship on the shoal 25 years ago to assert its claim and keeps
military personnel there all the time. In 2016, an Arbitral Tribunal
constituted under the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea ruled
in the Philippines' favor given the proximity of inhabited Filipino
islands to the shoal (meaning that the shoal is technically within the
Philippines' exclusive economic zone). But Beijing rejects that
argument. The United States has not ratified the convention upon which
the tribunal based its decision, though it tends to accept its logic.

[China]{.underline} has sometimes tried to
**[[impede]{.underline}]{.mark}** the resupply of [[the
**Philippines'**]{.mark} position]{.underline}. Earlier this year when
it did so, two ships collided, and a Filipino sailor lost his thumb.
Filipino President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. had earlier stated that were a
Filipino to lose his or her life in such a future showdown, that could
be seen as an act of war. The problem would be significant enough if it
involved only China and another regional country (there are others in
the region besides the Philippines mired in disputes with China over the
ownership of various islands). But because the United States has a
security treaty with the Philippines, it could feel obliged to intercede
in defense of its ally in the event of an escalating crisis in the
future, though the exact threshold of violence that would lead to
American intervention has not been specified, nor of course has the
nature or scale of any such hypothetical intervention.

The United States, **[[in the event of worsening
tensions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, would probably have only a few options:

Accompany a future Filipino resupply ship to the shoal and hope that
China would choose not to press the issue.

Shoot back at any Chinese ship that shot at Filipino or American
vessels.

Place its own personnel, at Filipino invitation, on the shoal and make
it clear it will not only resupply them but defend them.

Choose a non-military punishment of China, most likely in the economic
realm.

Fortunately, none of these options seem likely to lead to all-out war,
since it would be the height of irrationality and irresponsibility to
let such a skirmish blow up into a major confrontation. Unfortunately,
however, once the shooting starts and people start dying, it is hard to
rule out worrisome escalatory dynamics. Most wars in human history are
not accidental, but sometimes big wars do get sparked by small events,
as with the assassination of the archduke of Austria-Hungary in Bosnia
in June 1914, leading to World War I that August.

[An **[attempted]{.mark}** Chinese [**invasion** of
**Taiwan**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Might China, tired of waiting for reunification since 1949 (when the
Communist Party won China's civil war, and the losing Nationalists fled
to Taiwan) invade the island to force its absorption into the mainland?
Once done, it would be very hard to undo, to say the least (though the
United States might support resistance forces in Taiwan even if China
managed to get its military ashore in an attempt to control the island).

It would also be extremely dangerous for the region and the world
because of the risk that the United States would respond militarily. The
United States no longer has any treaty obligation to come to Taiwan's
defense, as it did before Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon began the
great opening to China in the 1970s. But the United States has a law
known as the (1979) Taiwan Relations Act declaring that it might well do
so if a Chinese attack against Taiwan occurred in an unprovoked manner.
The United States has historical bonds with Taiwan, having backed the
Nationalists during the civil war and then during the Cold War, and
since the Eisenhower administration, Washington has threatened to use
force to defend Taiwan. (In earlier eras, American maritime and air
supremacy over China's military was more lopsided than is the case
today, making the task easier.) The United States has economic reasons
to defend Taiwan, given that most of the world's best semiconductor
chips are made on the island. And it has strategic reasons: Taiwan's
fall could signal a China bent on regional aggression and
expansionism---whatever Beijing might say now about its aims being
limited to what it defines as national reunification---as well as a
United States no longer as committed to the defense of friends and
allies as it was once perceived to be. For these reasons, on as many as
six occasions when asked, President Joe Biden has indicated an
inclination to help defend Taiwan if China were to attack it (Biden gave
no indication, however, about whether he would ask Congress for
authorization).

The good news about deterring this war is that, for China, it would be a
huge roll of the dice---and I do not detect a recklessness or acceptance
of high risk in the leadership of today's People's Republic of China
(PRC). There are, of course, different views about the nature of the
China threat today, but few really argue that China would fail to
carefully consider the costs and risks of any major military operation.
President Xi Jinping is nationalist, assertive, and autocratic, but
there is little to suggest he shares his friend Vladimir Putin's
proclivity to use force for high-risk ventures. And this one would be
very risky, since amphibious assault has become even harder than during
World War II, given the proliferation of sensors that can detect big
troop ships and many types of precision missiles as well as torpedoes
(and drones) that can strike them. With some luck, Taiwan might itself
be able to fend off the attack; with prompt American military aid, it
would have a very good chance.

The bad news about this scenario, however, is that the United States
still largely relies on large, fixed airfields (notably on Okinawa,
Japan) and big ships (notably, aircraft carriers) to provide much of the
firepower that would be used to counter such an attack. It also has
fragile civilian infrastructure in the United States (ports, airfields,
electricity grids, fuel distribution networks) that it would need to
deploy, resupply, and control many of these military forces. These may
all be vulnerable to Chinese preemption. Yes, the United States has
attack submarines and long-range stealth bombers too, but China may
conclude that America does not have enough. The PRC might also
miscalculate America's ultimate willingness to risk World War III over
what, in Beijing's eyes, may seem a relatively minor interest to the
faraway United States. In other words, Beijing might, rightly or
wrongly, construct a theory of relatively rapid victory that it comes to
place great stock in.

When war games are carried out to gauge how these scenarios might play
out---and who might win---different games produce different results,
even about the ultimate victor. Some have projected that the United
States would ultimately succeed in helping Taiwan protect itself, though
possibly losing many aircraft, ships, and tens of thousands of personnel
in the effort. Other simulations have wound up predicting Chinese
victories.

My own views can be condensed into three main points:

This is an extremely risky scenario for China.

We can make it even riskier with the right kinds of additional military
investments by Taiwan and the United States---for example, unmanned or
tilt-rotor aircraft operating off Okinawa's roads that do not require
runways for launch and that can deploy sensors and shooters to the
Taiwan Strait in the event of an invasion attempt, and that in some
cases are numerous and inexpensive enough to be expendable without
jeopardizing America's future military posture. Unmanned underwater
vessels stationed permanently in the Western Pacific might play similar
roles.

If heaven forbid the scenario takes place anyway, even if China loses at
first, we are still in trouble. There is little reason to think the war
will simply then end. **[Beijing]{.underline}** might then [[consider
**nuclear threats**]{.mark} or **retaliation**]{.underline}, against
Taiwan and/or the United States. It might also simply settle back into
what I think is its best military and strategic option in the first
place: a blockade, perhaps combined with
**[[cyberattacks]{.underline}]{.mark}** and other forms of harassment or
limited violence. The blockade, and related operations as well as
American counters, might expand geographically to the Indian Ocean, the
Persian Gulf, and beyond. It is to that latter type of scenario that I
now turn.

China's best option: Blockade

[**Rather** than]{.underline} undertake a cosmic roll of the dice and
try to [**conquer Taiwan** with an **invasion**]{.underline}, what if
Beijing ratcheted up the kind of thing it has been doing of
late---[[sending **missiles** near **Taiwan**]{.underline}]{.mark} when
it senses that leaders in Taiwan or the United States are trying to
promote Taiwan's independence? For example, China [**[fired]{.mark}** a
number of [**missiles** into waters **around
Taiwan**]{.mark}]{.underline} in August 2022 after then-Speaker of the
House Nancy Pelosi visited the island. That has created a "new normal"
of heightened Chinese military activity near Taiwan; next time it
chooses to escalate, [China could [**aim closer** to
**shore**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Perhaps it could [[take out a
**ship**]{.mark} or two **anchored** in a port in **Taiwan** or [destroy
some **shipping cranes**]{.mark} in the harbor.]{.underline} Perhaps it
could [send]{.underline} 20 to 40 [**submarines** out to sea and
**threaten** to [sink any **commercial ship** going **in** or **out** of
**Taiwan**]{.mark}]{.underline}, unless that ship first docks in
mainland China and allows its cargo to be inspected. Baby food and
medicine might be allowed into Taiwan; [anything [**smacking** of
**military utility**]{.mark}, or even [**high-tech** goods **crucial**
to]{.mark} Taiwan's **[economic relationships]{.mark}** with the
**rest** of the **world**, might **not be.**]{.underline}

Beijing's goal with this kind of limited attack might be to target
Taiwan's economy more than its people or even its military---trying to
coerce, through economic pain and threatened strangulation, while
limiting any loss of life. Not only would the intensity of the operation
be adjustable like a rheostat, but the operation could even be
temporarily scaled back if and when too many American naval ships came
to Taiwan's assistance to set up a safe shipping channel and break the
blockade. Even if the United States and many core allies coalesced
around the idea of a strong response (as Western nations did when the
Soviets carried out the blockade of Berlin in 1948-1949), Beijing might
hope that many neutral countries would overlook the relatively limited
amounts of violence associated with this kind of operation and not join
the U.S. coalition.

I think this is the most credible scenario. It is also, I believe, very
hard for the United States to counter. We can try to sink those Chinese
submarines and shoot down those Chinese missiles, but the process will
be slow, and we will take losses, too. I have attempted, through simple
computations, to model how these scenarios might play out. Under certain
plausible assumptions, I believe the United States plus Taiwan and
probably Japan would win; under other equally plausible assumptions
about the performance and survivability of missiles, missile defenses,
surface ships, satellites, cyber systems, and other key assets, alas, I
fear China could "win" in the sense of sinking enough of our fleet
needed for the counterblockade operation that we would have to call off
the effort.

Of course, whichever side loses round one may try again. The loser
could, for example, rearm and then simply try again in a few years, or
it could expand the conflict geographically, or it could even threaten
the use of nuclear weapons (like Eisenhower did during the two Taiwan
crises of the 1950s). There is little reason to think this scenario
could be contained and little reason to think it would end soon---even
if one side or the other did seem to win at first. China would be
unlikely to give up in trying to seize an island it considers rightfully
its own, or to accept defeat at the hands of a country it considers its
main rival. [[The **U**]{.mark}**nited [S]{.mark}tates**]{.underline},
with its tradition of military assertiveness and strong devotion since
the 1940s to the defense of allies, [would **likely** [see the
**stakes** in]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}any such [war not **simply**
as the fate of **23 million** living]{.underline} in Taiwan, [but
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}fate of its [**entire
[system]{.mark}** [of **alliances** and
**partnerships**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The single best way that the United States can more effectively deter a
Chinese blockade of Taiwan, I believe, is to strengthen what
**[Secretary]{.underline}** of Defense [Lloyd Austin]{.underline} has
been [calling **integrated deterrence**]{.underline}, a term I also
coined in a 2019 book. It means working with allies to ensure that they
too send a strong message of willingness to [**resist** any **Chinese
attack**]{.underline}---not only with military responses but also with
economic preparations that would make their nations more resilient in
the event of a [**protracted** [economic war
pitting]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the **U**]{.mark}**nited
[S]{.mark}tates** and its **allies** and partners [against
**China**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

It would, of course, really be much better not to fight any of these
scenarios against China! The first is quite dangerous; the second and
third are profoundly perilous. [**[Deterrence]{.mark}** is]{.underline}
one part of [[the **path forward**]{.mark} for America]{.underline}, but
so is [a **commitment** to **crisis management**]{.underline}---and, on
some issues, [even to **compromise**]{.underline}. Beijing, Taipei, and
Washington all have [**crucial roles** to play in this
**effort**]{.underline}, since the irreducible objective must be to
[prevent [a **war**]{.mark}]{.underline} that might not prove
controllable---and [that [could become the **greatest tragedy** in the
**history** of the **human race**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

American policymakers and military leaders are increasingly convinced
that the [[Taiwan]{.mark} Strait [is]{.mark} the strategic [**nerve
center** of the **world**]{.mark}. **No other** flashpoint is as
structurally **unstable**, as]{.underline} politically vexing, and as
[likely to **draw** the world's leading **superpowers** into a

the use of overwhelming **[[force]{.underline}]{.mark}**. There is a
growing concern in Washington that it may no longer be a question of if
a Chinese attack on Taiwan will occur, but when and how.

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED NONE OMITTED\>\>

Of course, it is debatable whether the CCP high command is operating
according to a cast iron timeline. While prudent U.S. defense planners
might assume that the countdown to war has already begun (and argue that
countervailing American and Taiwanese preparations should proceed
accordingly), wise strategists will not close their minds to other
possibilities. It may very well be the case that Xi Jinping's plans and
intentions for Taiwan are elastic and changeable. For all we know, Xi is
convinced that a long-term campaign of coercion will succeed at
crumbling the Taiwanese government's ability to resist annexation. It
may even be the case that several politicians in Taiwan have been
secretly cultivated by Chinese intelligence, and they might one day
collaborate with the CCP to affect a takeover. The purpose of this
paper, however, is not to discuss such analytic problems, but rather to
explore what lies beyond the compass of the current discourse. An
understudied aspect of the Taiwan defense debate is what would happen
after an invasion was over. What might happen, for example, if the
People's Republic of China (PRC) succeeded in conquering Taiwan? How
would that impact U.S. national security? If Taiwan (Republic of China,
ROC) falls, what would the implications be for regional and global
security? In the following pages, we will examine these questions and
attempt to come to grips with an overlooked aspect of the most
consequential foreign policy problem of our time. Into the Great Unknown
It is axiomatic that there is no way for us to know how the future will
unfold. Unlike a code, puzzle, or cipher, the future cannot be solved.
There is no master key that can crack open the door and give us a look
at the scenes that will appear weeks, months, and years from now. At the
present time, we stand at the entryway of the here and now straining to
peer ahead, but we see nothing because there is nothing to see. That
world has yet to exist. Since accurate prediction is impossible and the
science of time travel remains speculative, we must exercise our
imaginations and, to a certain degree, our logic. We must think about
the unthinkable and accept that any thoughts we think will almost
certainly be falsified by events. Indeed, we will cherish the hope that
the future plays out in different ways entirely. With luck, the
following scenarios will prove wrong. Tens of millions of lives are at
stake, and the fates of billions of people could be irrevocably altered
by war in ways that we are ill- equipped to forecast. For the sake of
keeping our thought exercise within reasonable bounds, we will explore
only two of the manifold scenarios that are available or could be
conjured. In the first of our imagined futures, Taiwan is invaded by the
People's Liberation Army (PLA) and falls with no outside assistance from
the United States or others. In the second imagined future, Taiwan is
stormed and occupied by the PLA in spite of belated U.S. and allied
attempts to forestall that eventuality. In scrutinizing both cases, our
main concern will not be the finer details of how the storyline
unspools, but rather what the situation looks like once it does and what
the implications are for the United States and the region. But before we
plunge into our two nightmare scenarios, let us first take stock of what
it would mean for the United States to lose Taiwan as a democratic
partner and strategic bulwark against PRC expansionism. The Constants If
Taiwan falls, several implications will remain constant irrespective of
how it happens. Taiwan has outsized strategic value due to its
extraordinary political character, its unique military and intelligence
capabilities, its critical role in global high-tech supply chains, and
its geographic location in the heart of East Asia. Regardless of how
Taiwan is captured by the Chinese authorities, the region and the world
will have lost a leading democracy, and the security architecture of the
region will be altered. This would be a traumatic---and potentially
catastrophic---event in the history of American foreign policy. When a
Democracy Dies At the time of this writing, Taiwan is ranked among the
top 10 democracies in the world.1 Freedom House gave Taiwan a composite
score of 94 out of 100 when it came to measures of global freedom (in
comparison the United States ranked 83 and China ranked 9).2 Reporters
Without Borders recently said that Taiwan has a remarkably high level of
press freedom. Taiwan ranked 38 out of 180 in its World Press Freedom
Index (in comparison the United States ranked 42 and China ranked 175).3
Since its transition to democracy, Taiwan has not had a seat at the
United Nations or other international organizations. The United States
and many other countries nonetheless have robust unofficial
relationships with Taiwan, and Taiwan is widely considered by
governments across the democratic world to be a responsible, like-minded
partner and a model of good governance. Today, Taiwan can be counted on
to advance democratic values and human rights. If Taiwan was conquered,
it would become an occupied territory ruled by China's one-party
dictatorship. Its politics would fundamentally change. The free and
independent country that used to be Taiwan (ROC) would disappear, and a
repressive police state would emerge. The Chinese military would
establish an overwhelming presence on Taiwan alongside the CCP's
multi-layered internal security forces (MSS, MPS, PAP, Chengguan, etc.).
The Communist Party can be expected to employ terror tactics against the
local Taiwanese population. The mass surveillance and control complex
that is omnipresent in Xinjiang and Tibet would likely be exported to
Taiwan. A local proxy government under the direct control of Beijing
would rule the islands, and all territory formerly administered by the
ROC government would be harshly policed. Patriotic education and mass
propaganda campaigns would be launched in Taiwan to spread "Xi Jinping
Thought" and imprint "Chinese socialist values" onto the minds of the
vanquished population. A number of Taiwan's film, television, and
Mandopop stars can be expected to amplify Beijing's messages (many
already do). The post-invasion media environment would be characterized
by its high levels of censorship. Taiwan would exist on the brink of an
informational blackhole. While international reporters would not have
open access to Taiwan, it seems almost certain that scattered pieces of
information would emerge out of occupied areas in the form of grisly
pictures, video recordings, and refugee testimony that show violations
of human rights were underway.

\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS CONTINUE\>\>

Having lost one of its leading representatives, the [**free world**
would likely be in the presence of]{.underline} a
**[growing]{.underline}** sense that [**illiberal** forces]{.underline}
were on the march and **[[authoritarianism]{.underline}]{.mark}** was
[[spread]{.mark}ing in an **[unchecked]{.mark}** fashion]{.underline}.
The loss of Taiwan could [lead many democracies to experience a **crisis
of confidence**. [Many]{.mark}]{.underline} observers might
[[draw]{.mark} the [conclusion]{.mark} that
[China's]{.mark}]{.underline} Marxist-Leninist [[model]{.mark} was
**[superior]{.mark}**]{.underline}---or at the very least
ascendant---and liberal democracies too weak to resist the new world
order that Beijing was creating.

Lost Military and Intelligence Capabilities

[Taiwan's military **stands watch** over]{.underline} the vulnerable
flanks of **[Japan]{.underline}**'s southwestern approaches, protecting
Japan [and other **East Asian** countries from the threat of PRC
**expansionism**]{.underline}. Indeed, the ROC armed forces patrol and
monitor some of the world's busiest lines of communication. The air,
water, and electromagnetic spectrum around Taiwan are dense with all
manner of military and commercial traffic. Although often
unacknowledged, Taiwan's military has long been a reliable partner to
the United States on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief
operations. The U.S. and ROC governments reportedly share intelligence,
which the Americans are well positioned to collect with sophisticated
satellites, aircraft, and submarines, and the Taiwanese collect with
human agents, listening posts, and surveillance radars.4

[If Taiwan falls, its military **bases** and
**intelligence**]{.underline} facilities [would be **occupied** by the
[PLA]{.mark}. The Chinese **navy** can be expected to base]{.underline}
its ships and submarines in Taiwan's deep-water ports. The naval bases
at Su'ao and Keelung would be especially valuable for the PLA, [which
for the **first time**]{.underline} in its history would [[have
**unencumbered** access to]{.underline}]{.mark} the deep waters of the
[**[Pacific]{.mark}**. The **American**, **Japanese**, and
**Taiwanese**]{.underline} surveillance [systems]{.underline} that
currently track Chinese submarines in the shallow waters off the East
Asian littorals [would be]{.underline} rendered less effective (or
**[completely neutralized]{.underline}** in Taiwan's case).

By invading and occupying Taiwan, the [PLA would breach the **center**
of the First Island Chain]{.underline}. After the invasion, Chinese
bombers and missile units based on Taiwan would be able to
[[hold]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. forces in [**[Okinawa]{.mark}** and
[**Guam** at risk of]{.mark} **surprise [raids]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Chinese special forces and amphibious units [could use Taiwan to
**[invade]{.mark}** Japan's **[Ryukyu]{.mark}**]{.underline} islands
([**Yonaguni**, **Ishigaki**]{.underline}, etc.) [and Luzon, the
**[Philippines]{.mark}**]{.underline}' largest and most populated
island. PLA Navy surface action groups and aviation units based in
Taiwan and the Penghu islands could [threaten a **blockade** of Japan
and South **[Korea]{.mark}**]{.underline} by cutting off their primary
sea lines of communication. The [top of the
**[S]{.mark}**]{.underline}outh **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea [would be
"**corked**"]{.underline}---providing PLA ballistic missile submarines
with a maritime bastion and further [reinforcing China's military
**dominance**]{.underline} of Southeast Asia.

The United States would lose access to a critical intelligence gathering
hub, and the American analytic community would lose their primary window
into China. Taiwan is an irreplaceable source of Mandarin language
training and all-source intelligence on China. Without Taiwan, the
Pentagon and CIA would likely begin producing flawed analytical
products, which could leave policymakers ill-informed and prone to
making strategic mistakes. In the wake of the successful Chinese
invasion of Taiwan, U.S. intelligence failures could be expected to
increase.

Shattered Supply Chains

Today, Taiwan is the United States' 8th largest trading partner.5
According to the State Department: "U.S. exports of goods and services
to Taiwan supported an estimated 188,000 American jobs in 2019 \...
Taiwanese cumulative investment in the United States was nearly \$137
billion in 2020. Taiwan's direct investment \... directly support an
estimated 21,000 jobs in the United States and \$1.5 billion in U.S.
exports."6 A cross-Strait war would cost hundreds of thousands of
Americans their jobs, and hundreds of billions of dollars would be lost.

Further deeper economic pain would likely follow the initial blow to
American prosperity. "U.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) in Taiwan
(stock) was \$31.5 billion in 2020, a 8.8 percent increase from 2019.
Reported U.S. direct investment in Taiwan is led by manufacturing,
finance and insurance, and wholesale trade," according to the Office of
the United States TradeRepresentative.7

[The loss of Taiwan would]{.underline} negatively impact the health of
the U.S. economy and could [[trigger]{.mark} an economic
**[recession]{.mark}**]{.underline} in America and [[across]{.mark} the
**[world]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A recent report asserted that
"[[Taiwan]{.mark} may be the **most [critical link]{.mark}** [in]{.mark}
the entire **[tech]{.mark}**nology [ecosystem]{.mark}]{.underline},"
[due to its **dominance** in]{.underline} the **[chip
sector]{.underline}**, original equipment manufacturing, original design
manufacturing, and role as a central hub for producing
technology-related materials. The report found, "Taiwan currently serves
as a [key supplier]{.underline} and partner [to]{.underline} many
leading [U.S. **tech**nology **firms** like Apple, Nvidia, Texas
Instruments, and Qualcomn, as well as to many U.S. allies
globally]{.underline}."8 [That would all **disappear**]{.underline},
forcing companies to suffer massive profit losses at the very moment
they needed to invest in costly new facilities.

It is possible that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would cause a 21st
century version of the Great Depression. In any event, globalization
would probably cease to exist, as the world splintered into hostile
trade and security blocs. [**[Supply chains]{.mark}**,
already]{.underline} significantly [impacted by]{.underline} the
COVID-19 [pandemic]{.underline}, the Russian invasion of [Ukraine,
and]{.underline} instability in the [Middle East, would be
[**shattered**. Prices]{.mark} would
**[skyrocket]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Panic buying and hording would be
followed by a [[surge in **nativism** and]{.mark} strong impulse
toward]{.underline} trade **[[protectionism]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
self-sufficiency.

Harsh Geostrategic Realities

By seizing Taiwan, the [[PRC]{.mark} would have]{.underline} effectively
[**carved** out a **[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}phere
**[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**f **[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**nfluence for
itself in Asia using violent methods. This invasion would [have grave
implications for **i**nternational **law**]{.underline}, the ideal of
national self-determination, and the principle of state sovereignty. The
fall of Taiwan [would undermine **perceptions** of U.S.]{.underline}
global diplomatic and **[military leadership]{.underline}**, straining
(and possibly **[[brea]{.mark}king]{.underline}**) [the American
**alliance**]{.underline} system [and]{.underline} the
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[N]{.underline}]{.mark}**ations
System. [China would be]{.underline} viewed as [the **most powerful**
nation in the **world**]{.underline} and the primary mover of the 21st
century. Leaders would experience trepidation as Beijing marched
[toward]{.underline} its vision of a **[new]{.underline}** centralized,
[**authoritarian** world order]{.underline}.

[[Nuclear **arms racing**]{.underline}]{.mark} would start and [could
[easily]{.mark} rapidly **[spiral]{.mark}** out of control]{.underline}.
The likelihood of **[[World War Three]{.underline}]{.mark}** breaking
out could [[climb]{.mark} **higher**]{.underline} than anything
previously seen. It can be expected that the [**world** would begin
sliding toward]{.underline} the brink of an **[abyss]{.underline}**, and
human [**[civilization]{.mark}** would risk being **[knocked
backward]{.mark}**]{.underline} in its developmental story. Abstract
ideas like international law and universal values would increasingly
appear quaint, even faintly ridiculous. This would be a new age of
empires; might would once more make right.

In such circumstances, [[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark} could be expected to
go nuclear and [[become]{.mark} heavily
**[militarized]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Tokyo would likely be in the grip
of a profound sense of insecurity and disillusionment with U.S. defense
guarantees. It is possible that [Japanese politics could [swing
in]{.mark} a **right-wing**, [**authoritarian** direction]{.mark}.
Alternatively]{.underline}, it is possible that far left-wing
politicians could gain power, and Japan might [end up **band wagoning**
with China]{.underline}. In either event, there would be an increasing
risk that Japan's democracy would erode, and the country could
experience a wave of political violence. Over time, it may even be
[possible]{.underline} that [Japan would become a
**dictatorship**]{.underline}.

South Korea would almost certainly feel itself being pulled into China
orbit, and policymakers in Seoul would face the unpalatable choice of
losing of their freedom and sovereignty or resisting CCP influence
alongside the United States and Japan. [**South [Korea]{.mark}** would
likely [go **nuclear**]{.mark}]{.underline} and attempt to save their
nation from takeover by [building an independent **deterrent
force**]{.underline}. South Korea may experience an even deeper domestic
political crisis than Japan. It seems likely that the [**Philippines**,
**Indonesia**, **Malaysia**]{.underline}, and other Southeast Asia
nations that are currently hedging their bets would conclude that they
had no choice but to **[align]{.underline}** themselves [with
Beijing]{.underline} against the United States.

[**[North]{.mark} Korea** would likely be
**[emboldened]{.mark}**]{.underline} by a successful Chinese invasion of
Taiwan and reconsider long-dormant **[plan]{.underline}**s
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} weaken and, if possible, [**destroy** South
Korea's government and affect a **[takeover]{.mark}**]{.underline} of
the peninsula. With the power and prestige of the United States
drastically reduced and South Korea acutely vulnerable, it seems
probable that North Korea would seek to obtain China's help in attacking
South Korea. [Beijing]{.underline} is likely to [see the situation as an
**opportunity** to drive American forces **off** the Asian mainland.
China's government would]{.underline} probably
**[encourage]{.underline}** and support some degree of [North Korean
aggression]{.underline}. At a minimum, an unprecedented campaign of
coercion would likely result, which could escalate to war. At the same
time, CCP influence over Pyongyang would grow, and North Korea would
struggle in vain to maintain its independence from the new PRC empire.
**[[India]{.underline}]{.mark}** would almost certainly see the loss of
Taiwan as a national security disaster and [quickly **[expand]{.mark}**
its **[nuc]{.mark}**]{.underline}lear weapons [arsenal and further
**[build up]{.mark}** its conventional **[military]{.mark}** along the
**border**]{.underline}. With Taiwan gone, the [[PLA]{.mark} would
likely [focus on **re-taking**]{.mark} territories controlled by
**[Delhi]{.mark}**]{.underline} as its next major mission.
[[**Australia** will fear]{.mark} being
**[encircled]{.mark}**]{.underline} and isolated as the Chinese military
pushes across the South Pacific. [**Canberra** might opt to
[develop]{.mark}]{.underline} its own independent [[**nuclear**
armaments]{.underline}]{.mark} program and accelerate plans to acquire
nuclear-powered submarines. The Quad would be at a distinctive
crossroads; it may become the foundation for a collective security
organization like NATO, but it could just as easily fall apart.

A similar crossroads would be reached in Europe. With the United States
distracted humiliated by China, **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**
countries might rally together in common cause and redouble their
efforts to bolster collective security. It seems at least as probable,
however, that the post-war bonds that have long tied together the great
democracies of Europe [[would **fray**]{.mark}. Combined Chinese and
Russian **influence**]{.underline} campaigns might [**succeed** in
getting [countries]{.mark} such as **Germany**, **France**, and
**Italy** to [embrace **pro-Beijing** policies]{.mark}]{.underline} that
drive them against the United States [and **fatally [fracture]{.mark}**
the NATO [alliance]{.mark}]{.underline} network. [[European
**disunion**]{.mark} might [follow]{.mark}, throwing the continent
into]{.underline} a political environment eerily reminiscent of the
1920s and [19**30s**]{.underline}.

States," Atlantic Council,
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Kroenig-Deliberate-Nuclear-Use-in-a-War-over-Taiwan.pdf)

[[In]{.underline}]{.mark} the event of [a US-China [war over
**Taiwan**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [there are plausible scenarios in which
[either **China** or the **U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[would]{.mark} logically [consider
using **nuc**]{.mark}]{.underline}lear
weapon**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** in a limited fashion, given the high
stakes. Limited nuclear use is defined as a nuclear attack short of a
large-scale nuclear exchange designed to eliminate a large fraction of
an adversary state's military forces, industrial production, or
population. This section will lay out the plausible scenarios for either
side's deliberate nuclear use across the spectrum of employment---from
signaling to an attack on an operationally relevant target to an
extended nuclear exchange.

Scenarios for Chinese Limited Nuclear First Use

There are at least four scenarios for Chinese limited nuclear first use
in a conflict with the United States over Taiwan: nuclear signaling and
threats, a nuclear demonstration with no military effect, a nuclear
attack on Taiwan, or a nuclear attack on the forces or territory of the
United States or one or more of its regional allies.

Some might respond that these scenarios are implausible, given China's
pledge not to use nuclear weapons first in a conflict, but [there are
reasons to **doubt** China's **stated policy**]{.underline}. In fact,
[[China's]{.mark} nuclear [strategy]{.mark} plausibly
**[permits]{.mark}** a variety of **[nuclear
uses]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and the country unequivocally possesses the
capability to conduct a nuclear first strike. Moreover, US statements
and [[documents **cast doubt** on]{.mark} China's
**[n]{.mark}**]{.underline}o-**[[f]{.underline}]{.mark}**irst-**[[u]{.underline}]{.mark}**se
[policy]{.underline}.20 In addition, [[policy can **change** in]{.mark}
the midst of [a **crisis**]{.mark} or conflict]{.underline}, [and [there
is]{.mark}]{.underline} technically [[nothing about]{.underline}]{.mark}
China's nuclear **[[c]{.underline}]{.mark}**ommand [[and
**c**]{.underline}]{.mark}ontrol [[that would prohibit **first
use**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The United States must plan against this
possibility.

Signaling

In a crisis or a conflict over Taiwan, [Chinese [leadership might
use]{.mark} **nuclear [signaling]{.mark}** [to stop]{.mark} or limit a
**US [intervention]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This signaling could take a
variety of forms. [Chinese leadership or state media could issue
threats]{.underline}---vague or specific, public or private---[that warn
of]{.underline} "**[catastrophic consequences]{.underline}**" for the
United States if it interfered with Chinese "internal matters." [The
Chinese military could visibly **alert** its nuclear
forces]{.underline}, including by dispatching mobile missiles from
garrison, dispersing bombers to different airfields, and perhaps even
releasing warheads from central storage to operational units. [China
could also **test** its nuclear **delivery vehicles**]{.underline}. This
could be through a routine test like an intercontinental ballistic
missile (ICBM) launch in its western test ranges. China could perhaps
also test a new capability, like its August 2021 test of a boost-glide
hypersonic missile with fractional orbital bombardment capability, which
reportedly took US defense officials by surprise and was "very close" to
a "Sputnik moment" in the words of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
Gen. Mark Milley.21 Perhaps interpreting Russian nuclear threats against
Ukraine as successful in dissuading direct US and NATO intervention,
China could believe that raising the salience of nuclear weapons would
deter the United States and its allies from joining the war on Taiwan's
side.

Demonstration

The Chinese military could conduct a nuclear demonstration. It could
take a step up from nuclear signaling by actually detonating a nuclear
device without having direct military effects. The least provocative
demonstration would be a test at an existing Chinese test range. China
has not conducted a nuclear weapons test since its 1996 signature of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which it has not ratified. The purpose of
such a test would aim to convince Taiwanese, US, and allied governments
and publics of China's seriousness about the conflict and its
willingness to escalate to nuclear use. A more provocative nuclear
demonstration could occur above the waters surrounding Taiwan or perhaps
even above international waters in the vicinity of a US military base in
the Western Pacific.

Nuclear Attack on Taiwan

[A **nuclear [attack]{.mark}** [against Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}
itself [could [target]{.mark} Taiwanese [**military** or
**leadership**]{.mark} facilities]{.underline}---possibly before the
United States has committed troops to Taiwan's defense---[[as a
**gambit**]{.mark} to collapse Taiwan's defenses]{.underline},
[decapitate its leadership]{.underline}, [and deter]{.underline} the
United States and its [allies from supporting Taiwan]{.underline}. In
recent years, experts have recommended that Taiwan transform its
military into a distributed force capable of a "porcupine defense" less
vulnerable to air and missile bombardment. Still, [there are significant
[Taiwanese]{.mark} **military [facilities]{.mark}**]{.underline} (air
bases, ports, and army bases) [or naval vessels that might [present
**attractive targets**]{.mark} for a nuclear attack]{.underline}. The
Chinese military could use nuclear weapons to strike some of these
facilities with minimal collateral damage to the Taiwanese populace or
economy. By contrast, [[China could also consider a
**decapitating**]{.mark} **nuclear [strike]{.mark}** against Taiwanese
national leadership in Taipei]{.underline} or against Taiwanese
continuity-of-government locations. The goal of these attacks would be,
first, to collapse Taiwanese government and, second, to signal to the
Taiwanese population and the wider world that China is willing to
escalate to the highest levels to achieve its goal of conquering Taiwan.
A strike against an urban center would bring especially grave diplomatic
and reputational repercussions for China and damage the postwar value of
Taiwan to Beijing.

In either instance, a nuclear strike could be carried out before the
United States or other countries had committed forces to the conflict,
presenting those nations with the difficult choice of declaring war on a
China that had already demonstrated its willingness to use nuclear
weapons to prevail.

Nuclear Attack on US Forces, Allies, or Territory

Territory China could use nuclear weapons against US or allied forces or
territory if it judged that nuclear use could confer a significant
advantage.

[If the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates and its allies
and partners [did decide to **come to the aid** of Taiwan with military
force]{.underline}, [[China could]{.mark} elect to [use
**nuc**]{.mark}]{.underline}lear weapon**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** in a
limited way [[against US]{.mark} or allied **[forces]{.mark}**, US
military **[facilities]{.mark}**]{.underline} on the territory of allies
engaged in the fight, [[or]{.mark} even US
**[territory]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Targets for nuclear use could
include US or allied forces in the region, such as US carrier strike
groups or surface action groups. A Chinese response might also include
attacks on US military facilities located on the territory of allies,
such as Kadena Air Base located on Okinawa, Japan. Finally, such a
strike could target US military facilities on US territory, most notably
Andersen Air Force Base (AFB) on Guam. Even if the United States or its
allies had not yet declared their intent to support Taiwan against a
Chinese invasion with military force, [Chinese [leadership
could]{.mark}]{.underline} still decide that such intervention was
likely and decide to [[engage in **nuclear use**
early]{.underline}]{.mark}, [motivated by the possibility of
significantly **reducing** the **capacity**]{.underline} of the United
States or its allies [to intervene in the conflict]{.underline}. Nuclear
use before a declaration of war could possibly be more useful to China
if US or allied forces were not yet alerted or dispersed.

In addition to this warfighting logic, [a Chinese
[decision]{.mark}]{.underline} to use nuclear weapons against US forces
[[could be motivated by]{.mark} a desire to **avoid
defeat**]{.underline}: If Chinese leadership believed that it was losing
a conventional war over Taiwan, it might seek to escalate to nuclear use
in hopes of compelling negotiations for a settlement---[a similar logic
to]{.underline} the Russian
"**[[escalate-to-de-escalate]{.underline}]{.mark}**" strategy.22

Additionally, it is possible (though, of these possibilities, least
likely), that Chinese leadership might believe, due to escalation in a
conventional war, that US nuclear use may be likely and imminent. In
that scenario, the CCP could decide that a preemptive, large-scale
nuclear strike on the US homeland is necessary. This seems especially
unlikely given the ultimate escalatory nature of this action and the
reality that China does not---and will very likely not for the next five
to ten years---possess a strategic force capable of a successful
counterforce strike on the US nuclear triad. The United States will
likely retain a robust second-strike capability in that time period.
Such an attack, therefore, would likely result in a destructive
retaliatory strike on the Chinese homeland---Chinese leadership is
unlikely to take that risk.

In sum, if Beijing decided to invade Taiwan, China could possibly engage
in nuclear threats or use to deter outside intervention; compel Taiwan
to surrender; defeat Taiwanese, US, or allied forces; or force
negotiations if the Chinese conventional offensive was on the brink of
collapse.

Scenarios for US Limited Nuclear First Use

The United States might choose to use nuclear weapons in the event of a
Chinese invasion of Taiwan---especially if a Chinese victory looked
imminent or if China engaged in a nonnuclear strategic attack on the US
homeland. US declaratory policy does not rule out nuclear first use.23
This policy assures allies and partners that the United States would
consider using nuclear weapons to deter or respond to a strategic
attack. Further, it forces a potential adversary not to count out US
nuclear weapons if it aggressed against a US ally or partner. The United
States has previously identified conditions for nuclear first use as a
response to aggression. During the Cold War, the United States relied on
nuclear deterrence to backstop local defenses, including prescribing
that nuclear weapons be "available for use as other conventional
munitions" in the event of hostilities.24 US strategists planned for
nuclear first use in the event of a Soviet invasion of West Germany, a
situation not dissimilar to the potential local conventional inferiority
the United States may soon be facing in the Taiwan Strait. It is not
outside the realm of possibility that US strategists today could adapt
plans like those for the specific political and physical geography of
the contemporary Western Pacific, alongside greater investment in
conventional defense and closer collaboration with allies.25

[The [likeliest scenarios for **US**]{.mark} **nuclear [first
use]{.mark}**]{.underline} during a Chinese invasion of Taiwan [[would
be an attack]{.mark} directly [against the]{.mark} Chinese [invasion
force]{.mark} in the face of a **Taiwanese defeat** [or as]{.mark}
[**retaliation** for]{.mark}]{.underline} a large-scale [nonnuclear
strategic [attack on the]{.mark} US **[homeland]{.mark}**
or]{.underline} that of its **[allies]{.underline}**.

The United States could find itself in a scenario in which the president
decides to use nuclear weapons because he or she seeks to prevent the
success of a Chinese invasion but lacks the conventional forces to do
so. This situation could come about for a variety of reasons, including
an intelligence failure that does not provide warning of a Chinese
buildup, a successful Chinese conventional preemptive strike on key US
conventional forces in the region, or a failure by the United States to
invest in sufficient conventional forces to defend Taiwan. In this case,
the United States would seek to use nuclear weapons against the invasion
force to frustrate the immediate success of the attack and to provide
time for reinforcements or give room for diplomacy.

The United States might also seek to use nuclear weapons to deter or
respond to a nonnuclear strategic attack on the US homeland or nuclear
command and control. The 2022 National Defense Strategy
"\[r\]ecogniz\[es\] growing kinetic and non-kinetic threats to the
United States' homeland from our strategic competitors."26 China can
likely conduct kinetic or non-kinetic attacks on the United States.
These attacks could include disruptions of critical infrastructure
(e.g., the power grid or financial system), which might rise to the
level of "extreme circumstances" that threaten "the vital interests" of
the United States, as described in the 2022 Nuclear Posture Review.27 US
leaders might consider nuclear use to demonstrate to China that it
cannot expect to gain enduring advantage from these nonnuclear strategic
attacks on the US homeland or those of US allies and partners.

Scenarios for an Extended Nuclear Exchange

In the event that either the United States or China used a single
nuclear weapon or a handful of nuclear weapons in any of the scenarios
above, the prospect for an extended nuclear exchange would loom large.
Of course, a single nuclear detonation would not lead automatically to a
nuclear Armageddon. Chinese leadership could conceivably elect not to
respond to US nuclear use with nuclear weapons of its own---especially
if China seemed likely to prevail regardless. A US response to a Chinese
nuclear first use could also possibly convince Chinese leadership that
it had nothing to gain from further escalation. As in the Cold War,
strategists on both sides will identify pathways from one nuclear
battlefield use to a full nuclear exchange, so that knowledge may induce
caution for both parties.

[If a single nuc]{.underline}lear weapon [is used]{.underline}, [[it is
not hard to imagine how that could **escalate**]{.mark} to a strategic
**nuclear exchange**]{.underline}. The United States might use nuclear
weapons against Chinese landing ships. [China could retaliate by
striking **Andersen AFB** on Guam]{.underline}. [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [could strike **several airfields** on the Chinese
mainland]{.underline}. China could retaliate by using an ICBM against US
military bases in Alaska. [[Strategists]{.underline}]{.mark} on both
sides [would [start to]{.mark} seriously [contemplate]{.mark} the value
of a [**damage-limiting** strike]{.mark}]{.underline} as a broader
exchange begins to look inevitable. Indeed, [[given]{.mark} that [the
**number** of]{.mark} US [nuc]{.mark}]{.underline}lear weapon[[s]{.mark}
available for theater-based]{.underline}, [low-yield strikes [is **quite
lo**]{.mark}**w**]{.underline}, [such [pressures]{.mark} might
[emerge]{.mark} **relatively [early]{.mark}** for the

A leading China hawk, Gallagher claimed: "[The [CCP]{.mark} is
[**laser-focused** on]{.mark}]{.underline} its vision for [the
**[future]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- a world crowded with
[[techno-totalitarian surveillance]{.underline}]{.mark} states [[where
**human rights** are **subordinate**]{.underline}]{.mark} to the whims
of the party." While it's true that the Chinese Communist Party has
created a system of "techno-totalitarian surveillance" in China and is
happy to sell its surveillance technology to other countries, there is
scant evidence that it is conspiring to export its system of oppression
globally. Gallagher's vision is merely an update of the old Cold War
paranoia about a supposed Soviet plot to take over the world, which
missed the fact that Soviet leaders were driven primarily by defensive
concerns about their own security.

But Gallagher is right that [[the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates
[and China are locked in an **existential
struggle**]{.mark}]{.underline}, because this new cold war, like the
original Cold War with the Soviet Union, [[has the **potential** to
turn]{.mark} into a **[nuclear]{.mark} conflict**]{.underline}. This is
a danger that China hawks --- and the U.S. public in general --- do not
pay sufficient attention to. President Biden, for example, repeatedly
says that the United States will defend Taiwan if it's attacked, without
any mention of the potential consequences of a [[conflict with
**China**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

"It seems odd that war with China over Taiwan seems a comfortable
assumption for so many when the U.S. and NATO remain cautious about
Russia's war in Ukraine precisely because of the perceived risk of
nuclear escalation," John K. Culver, a CIA veteran and former national
intelligence officer for East Asia, told me.

Even many worst-case scenarios about China are too sanguine about the
outcome of a conflict. In March, for example, House Republicans took
part in a U.S.-China war game organized by retired Rear Adm. Mark
Montgomery, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of
Democracies. After the exercise was first reported by my Post colleague
Olivier Knox, I reached out to Montgomery to ask how it unfolded and
whether it included a nuclear exchange.

He said, "The war game ended up with China having a lodgment on Taiwan,
but not having defeated the Taiwan Army." The United States suffered
"significant casualties" and Taiwan "awful casualties." Montgomery
explained that the scenario "did not escalate to nuclear, although that
is certainly a possibility in this sort of contingency."

The lack of a nuclear exchange is quite common in U.S.-China war games,
at least those conducted at the unclassified level. (A senior defense
official told me this is no longer the case with top-secret Pentagon war
games.) A recent war game organized by the Center for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS), like the congressional war game, had the
United States and its allies defeating a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.
Victory came at "high cost" --- "The United States and its allies lost
dozens of ships, hundreds of aircraft, and tens of thousands of service
members" --- but not at the highest cost: i.e., the destruction of U.S.
cities. CSIS senior adviser Mark F. Cancian told me that, although he
would pursue "a follow-on project that looks at nuclear operations," he
wanted to focus specifically on conventional operations.

That's a perfectly legitimate choice, but it inadvertently risks
reinforcing assumptions that a U.S.-China conflict could avoid nuclear
escalation. Even a New York Times op-ed in February written by an
Australian scholar, headlined "A War With China Would Be Unlike Anything
Americans Faced Before," focused on cyberwarfare and economic warfare
--- not nuclear warfare.

And yet China is in the midst of a rapid nuclear buildup. The latest
Pentagon report on Chinese military power projects that its nuclear
stockpile will grow from 400 warheads today to 1,500 warheads by 2035.
The report also warns that, while China nominally adheres to a "no first
use" policy on nuclear weapons, "Beijing probably would ... consider
nuclear use to restore deterrence if a conventional military defeat
gravely threatened PRC survival." Given that a failed invasion of Taiwan
could threaten the CCP's power, it's reasonable to worry that China
could up the ante by going nuclear.

[[The risk]{.mark} of nuclear **[escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline} is
all the [[greater because]{.underline}]{.mark}, as a senior U.S. admiral
explained to me, it would be [[difficult for the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [to **win** ]{.mark}**a war** [over
Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline} by attacking only Chinese ships at sea and
Chinese aircraft in the skies. The United States could find itself
compelled, as a matter of military necessity, to attack bases in China.
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, in turn, [[could
**strike**]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. bases in [**[Japan]{.mark}**,
**[So]{.mark}uth [Ko]{.mark}rea**, [the **Philippines**]{.mark},
**[Guam]{.mark}**, even **[Hawaii]{.mark}** and the **[West
Coast]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Culver, the former intelligence officer, told me, "Even if Beijing
announced that its retaliatory strikes against Hawaii or the West Coast
of the U.S. were conventionally armed, it would risk immediate U.S.
escalation. Can a U.S. president refuse to launch in the 30 minutes
between missile launch from China and impact in the U.S.?"

When two nuclear-armed powers attack each other's territory, it would be
difficult to keep the conflict contained at a conventional level. Both
sides, admittedly, would have an incentive to avoid "mutual assured
destruction," but countries often act rashly in the heat of battle,
particularly after they have suffered significant casualties and feel
the need to ensure that their troops did not die in vain.

For a sense of how destructive [[a war with **China** could
be]{.underline}]{.mark}, read "2034: A Novel of the Next World War" by
retired Adm. James Stavridis, a former supreme allied commander in
Europe, and Marine combat veteran Elliot Ackerman. It ends --- spoiler
alert --- with [[**nuclear devastation** in both
countries]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Stavridis told me: "If the U.S. and China manage to sleepwalk into a
conventional war, [[the chances of it]{.underline}
**[escalating]{.underline}**]{.mark} [into a [nuclear]{.mark} exchange
[are **significant**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Two great powers who face
each other in combat are unlikely to avoid using tactical nuclear
weapons, at least at sea. [[Once that threshold is
**crossed**]{.underline}]{.mark}, it is but a short step to a much
broader nuclear conflict. [[Think 1914 with **nuclear weapons**]{.mark}
at the **[ready]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

1914 with nuclear weapons? Now [[that's an **existential
danger**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Tariffs, and a Superpower Without Credibility," The Diplomat,
https://thediplomat.com/2025/04/trump-tariffs-and-a-superpower-without-credibility/;
//ff\]

[Recent developments in the **Trump** administration's handling of
**tariff negotiations** point to a deeper concern]{.underline} -- not
just for trade policy, but [for the exercise of **U.S. power more
broadly**. By not having a full, clear, and certain trade negotiation
strategy, Washington]{.underline} risks **[diminishing]{.underline}**
the one resource a superpower cannot afford to lose:
**[credibility]{.underline}**.

The administration's theory of the case for tariffs was clear. Tariffs,
used aggressively and unapologetically, were to serve as economic shock
therapy, jolting allies and adversaries alike into "fairer" trade deals,
under the weight of the United States' economic might, that would help
rebalance international trade and reinvigorate U.S. industry.

[The U.S. economy]{.underline}, robust and resilient, [was the
**cornerstone of this gamble**]{.underline}. President Donald [Trump's
bet was that Washington could absorb more economic pain than
Beijing]{.underline}, Brussels, or Ottawa. Tariffs were not merely
punitive; they were a signal. The United States had the stamina, the
grit, and the stomach for a sustained trade war.

But [in the span of **just a few weeks**, through]{.underline} **[public
reversals]{.underline}**, **[shifting deadlines]{.underline}**, [and
**contradictory signals**, U.S. **credibility** to negotiate itself out
of this self-created dilemma has all but **eroded**]{.underline}.

We've seen this dynamic before. [In 2013, when the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [declared a "red line"
over Syria's use of chemical weapons, the subsequent failure to
**enforce** that line had consequences far **beyond** the Middle East.
It was not a question of military strength, but of **perceived
will**]{.underline}. As the saying goes, ["superpowers don't bluff." But
when they do, the consequences **ripple** across **every region and
issue**]{.underline}. Today, the United States faces a similar moment,
this time on the economic front.

The **[Trump]{.underline}** administration [has drawn multiple red lines
with tariffs, against]{.underline} **[China]{.underline}**,
**[Europe]{.underline}**, **[Mexico]{.underline}**,
**[Japan]{.underline}**, **[Canada]{.underline}**,
**[So]{.underline}**uth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea, [and]{.underline}
strategic partners in **[Southeast Asia]{.underline}**. It's hard to
know precisely what those red lines are for each country -- but we do
know what the consequences are.

The bond market and foreign exchange markets have done what no foreign
adversary could: they've exposed the vulnerability of not having
credibility. A [**falling dollar** and rising yields signaled investors'
concerns not just with **global uncertainty**, but with U.S. **economic
predictability and resolve**. The decision to **pull back**
tariffs]{.underline} -- supposedly for a 90-day "pause" -- may have been
framed as a strategic adjustment, but it [has been **perceived
globally** as a **retreat**]{.underline}.

This shift has done more than weaken the credibility of tariffs as a
negotiating tool. It has inverted the balance of leverage. [Where once
foreign capitals believed the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [was willing to escalate a trade war and endure
pain in service of long-term structural change, they now see a U.S.
government **hesitant** to bear the political and economic
costs]{.underline} -- and increasingly eager to secure any deal that can
be presented as a "win."

Negotiators in Beijing are astute students of power. Xi Jinping's
strategy is not one of panic; it is one of attrition, patience, and
strength through endurance. Yet after attempting to punish China
severely for daring to implement retaliatory economic measures, Trump
did an abrupt about-face, promising that the sky-high 145 percent
tariffs on Chinese imports will "come down substantially" in the near
future. [By **signaling uncertainty** now, without securing meaningful
concessions or a coherent long-term strategy, Washington risks
**encouraging Beijing** to **hold out** and **bleed away U.S. leverage**
over time. Why concede anything when **patience** appears to be **paying
off**?]{.underline}

[The impact of these shifts has diminished the **perception** that
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [is
**prepared** to **stay the course** on the tariffs. This **perceived
vulnerability** risks **emboldening competitors** who now see hesitation
where there was once resolve]{.underline}.

The result is a strategic nightmare. [The]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [now finds itself
in]{.underline} the worst of all possible worlds: it faces [a **weakened
economic position**, diminished **global trust**, and **adversaries**
who now believe they can **extract more** by simply **waiting out the
turbulence**. Deals made under such conditions will be agreements born
of **political urgency, not national strength**]{.underline}.

This moment is not just about tariffs. It's about how power is wielded
in a multipolar world. [Credibility is a **perishable
commodity**]{.underline}. Once lost, it's hard to regain.

#### 2. [RECRUITMENT]{.underline}. 

**Hydock '25** \[Evan; publisher for Georgetown Security Studies Review.
April 27; "Is the Military Recruiting Crisis Over? Not quite."
Georgetown Security Studies Review,
https://georgetownsecuritystudiesreview.org/2025/04/27/is-the-military-recruiting-crisis-over-not-quite/;
//ff\]

The Recruitment Crisis is Real, but Not New

Recently, the U.S. military has faced challenges in recruiting new
personnel. [In FY2022, the Army **missed its quota** by **over 25%**.
The service did not fare any better in FY2023, again **falling short**
of its goal to add 65,500 new active-duty soldiers. The Navy and Air
Force experienced a similar fate in FY2023, each missing the mark by
**several thousand recruits**]{.underline}. Only the Marine Corps and
Space Force have achieved their active and reserve component recruiting
objectives.

[The inability of the military to meet its recruitment goals is
well-documented by the]{.underline} Department of Defense
(**[DoD]{.underline}**). [Nearly all of the DoD Inspector General's Top
Management and Performance Challenges reports from FY**2016** to
FY**2025** raise concerns about "Building the Future Force" and
"Increasing **Military Readiness**," of which recruitment is a
**critical part**]{.underline}. These challenges have gained the
attention of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, garnering over 30
mentions during Secretary Hegseth's confirmation hearing in January.

However, the recruitment crisis is not a new phenomenon---it is a
dilemma as old as the all-volunteer force itself. Historical trends show
that [ever since the **draft** was abolished in early **1973**, military
recruitment has risen and fallen with the **economic
tide**]{.underline}. When the economy is strong, fewer Americans enlist
due to higher-paying opportunities in the civilian workforce. By
contrast, when military wages compete with civilian jobs, enlistment is
more stable. For example, in the 1970s and 1980s, military recruitment
benefited from wage stagnation and a poor economy. But those conditions
do not last forever. In 2018, confronted with a U.S. economy that saw
its fastest growth since 2005, the Army failed to reach its recruitment
goal for the first time since, not coincidentally, 2005 as well. Thus,
recruitment has always been one of the military's most pressing
challenges and should be viewed as the norm, not the exception.

The COVID-19 Pandemic Helps to Explain the Crisis

But the economy does not explain everything. [Even in a U.S. economy
that was devastated by]{.underline} the **[COVID]{.underline}**-19
pandemic, [military recruiting was **still** hit particularly
hard]{.underline}. For one, [recruiters were limited in their
**capacity** to have in-person **interactions**. The services also
decided to temporarily **shut down** their **basic
trainings**]{.underline}. More critically, however, [recruits struggled
to meet many of the military's **standards for
enlistment**]{.underline}.

Today, [**less than 30%** of American youth are qualified for military
service]{.underline} due to a variety of physical and academic
deficiencies. The pandemic added fuel to the fire by reducing the
already small percentage of the U.S. population eligible to serve. With
schools closed, students were forced to continue their learning online.
Evidence shows that school systems were unprepared for the shift to a
virtual classroom. Students struggled to adapt to the new learning
environment, leading to poorer academic performance. [Social isolation
also increased the rate of obesity]{.underline} among U.S. adults. All
of these trends hurt military recruitment, and the [services tried to
**compensate** by adjusting their enlistment requirements]{.underline}.
For example, in December 2022, the Navy scaled down its entrance exam
score, and, in 2023, the Air Force loosened its body fat restrictions.

Mental illness is another critical factor. During the first year of the
pandemic, the [prevalence of anxiety and depression among Americans was
**six times higher** than the previous year]{.underline}. Today, 22.8%
of the adult U.S. population suffers from some form of mental illness,
with the highest percentage between the ages of 18-25---the average age
range of military recruits. While mental illness is not a disqualifier
to military service, it may [**dissuade** Americans from deciding to
join the military, fearing that they will be **viewed unfavorably** or
be unable to obtain a **security clearance**]{.underline}. Ultimately,
[the military is only able to recruit from the **available pool of
civilians**, many of whom]{.underline}, for a variety of reasons, [are
**unable or disinclined to serve**]{.underline}.

Recruitment Has Rebounded, but it is Too Early to Declare Victory

Last October, DoD announced that recruitment rose 12.5% in FY2024
compared to the previous year. With nearly all services meeting their
FY2024 goals, recruitment seems to be on the mend. However, the problem
is not resolved, and it is misleading for the White House to take
complete credit for this progress.

Recruiting is rebounding largely because the military services
overhauled their approaches. Last year, the Army's budget proposal
included several provisions for improved recruiting. The service
increased its marketing and advertising budget by 10% and dedicated
\$675 million to enlistment bonuses and quick ship contracts, where
recruits report to basic training within a month of enlistment.
Similarly, over the last year, the Navy created more opportunities for a
younger, tech-savvy recruitment pool by adding a robotics specialization
to its ranks. It also improved the quality of life for its sailors,
including by opening 24/7 fitness centers and creating more access to
parking. The Air Force implemented similar incentives, like reinstating
its college loan repayment program and accelerating naturalization
opportunities.

The services started experiencing positive results from their efforts
more than a year ago---well before President Trump was elected in
November. During a media roundtable in October 2024, Major General
Johnny Davis, USAREC Commander, stated that "\[Recruiting momentum\]
really started in February 2024, after about a year of putting many of
these initiatives together, and it hasn't slowed down." In the same
discussion, Brigadier General Christopher Amrhein, Commander of the Air
Force Accessions Center (AFAC) and Air Force Recruiting Service (AFRS),
claimed that since 2023, over 10,000 recruits joined the Air Force and
Space Force due to the new policy changes and incentives. Similarly, the
Navy attributed its FY2024 success in part to its decision to expand
opportunities for sailors and marines. It is important to note that this
recruitment success occurred despite a U.S. economy that recovered from
the COVID-19 pandemic faster than expected. Accordingly, the services
overcame the normally predictable correlation between a strong economy
and poor recruitment, thereby developing an effective recruiting
strategy during periods of low unemployment.

While the White House plays a dominant role in shaping military and
defense policy, the credit for recruiting rebounds belongs to the
military services, their respective recruiting commands, and most
importantly, the individual recruiters who interact with American youths
and communities each and every day. However, the White House is in
danger of slowing, and even reversing, this momentum if it continues to
attack current service members and those who are considering military
service.

A Blow to Recruiting

President [**Trump** is prompting a massive reshaping of the U.S.
military]{.underline}. The negative impact that his administration's
actions will have on recruitment should not be overlooked. [Shortly
after his inauguration, the President signed a series of executive
orders **eliminating**]{.underline} diversity, equity, and inclusion
(**[DEI]{.underline}**) [initiatives in the military---directing, for
example, the Pentagon to **ban** transgender people from
serving]{.underline}. Similarly, [the Pentagon ordered the Army, Navy,
and Air Force to halt their cooperation with organizations like
the]{.underline} Black Engineer of the Year Awards
(**[BEYA]{.underline}**), an annual conference with which the military
partners to recruit top science talent. [The White House is also
**purging** top military officers and the boards at U.S. military
academies and colleges, claiming they are **"woke"** and **unfit for
leadership**. In late February, General C.Q. Brown, Jr., former Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Admiral Lisa Franchetti, former Chief
of Naval Operations, were **fired from their posts**---two moves that
**prompted concern** but received **little pushback** from
Congress]{.underline}. Moreover, the political and sports worlds entered
a frenzy when [the Pentagon **wiped information** from its website pages
that were allegedly DEI-related]{.underline}, including the Army career
of baseball player Jackie Robinson.

While the administration's policies are relatively nascent and FY2025 is
still underway, many are concerned about the [effects of these policies
on **recruitment**]{.underline}. Although Jackie Robinson's information
was restored and the administration has defended its other actions, the
President should exercise caution---creating [too much **chaos and
division** could hurt the military's ability to develop a talented and
lethal fighting force]{.underline}. In response to abandoning BEYA and
other similar organizations, [military officials noted that their
ability to **recruit talented minorities** will be **diminished**. The
veteran community is also speaking out]{.underline} against the
administration's actions, stating that [attacks on diversity will
"affect recruitment and **demoralize minorities already serving**,"
making it harder for Americans to "have any **sense of belonging** in
the armed forces]{.underline}." It is one matter to remove or prevent
people from serving on the grounds of incompetence. But [by **barring
and discouraging qualified Americans from serving** because of their
race, ethnicity, gender, or political ideology, the administration is
**degrading**]{.underline} both [the military]{.underline} and broader
U.S. national security.

Diversity is not only a moral imperative, but more importantly, a
practical one. If the military is the nation's preeminent institution
for preserving the Constitution and protecting the American people, it
must embrace a diverse talent base. The Trump administration is
presenting a false choice between lethality and diversity. Promoting
diversity does not make the military less combat effective or mean that,
to be more inclusive, it must lower its standards. Becoming an Army
Ranger or F-16 pilot has nothing to do with race or gender---it is about
meeting the standards. In 2020, General (ret.) Mark Milley stated that
diversity improves "the system, the military, our problem-solving
capabilities, and warfighting readiness." That sentiment holds true
today. DoD policy should acknowledge the role that different ideas,
backgrounds, and talents play in making the military a better fighting
force, while maintaining its focus on its ultimate mission: Winning the
nation's wars.

Increasing Opportunities and Propensity to Serve

Less hostility towards DEI programs will attract more Americans to serve
in the military. But there are several other approaches the military can
take to bolster recruitment, including increasing both the opportunities
and the propensity to serve. For the most part, the services are already
implementing these strategies.

The military is creating opportunities to prepare Americans for service
who otherwise may not be able to reach the standards on their own. The
Army's Future Soldier Preparatory Course, established in 2022, is a
hallmark of this effort. With a 95% graduation rate, the program has
improved recruits' fitness and test scores without compromising Army
regulations and standards. The Navy has taken a similar approach with
its Future Sailor Preparatory Course. Launched a year ago, the program
sends roughly 90% of its recruits to Navy basic training and has
produced several Honor Graduates. Additionally, the Air Force is
implementing plans to restructure AFAC and AFRS under a new Airman
Development Command, a move the service expects will better facilitate
recruitment and training. Aside from basic training preparatory courses,
investing in ROTC and JRTOC programs, which train the military's future
officers and offset the cost of college, should also be a top priority.

Increasing the propensity to serve is equally important. Dr. Katie
Helland, Director of Military Accession Policy for the DoD, notes that
[today's youth are both **uninterested** in the military and
**uninformed** about what serving actually entails. Only **15%** of
young adults have a parent who served, which is down from **40% in
1990**]{.underline}. West Point's Modern War Institute observes a
similar trend, in that the American public lacks familiarity with
military service. Dispelling misperceptions of military service is
critical to overcoming recruitment challenges. To do that, the services
need to follow the Army's lead and overhaul their budgets to include
more provisions for recruiting. They also need to implement programs
such as the Air Force's "We Are All Recruiters," which enables airmen
and guardians, regardless of occupational specialty, to find and attract
the best of America's talent.

In 2010, retired Admiral Mike Mullen, former chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, said "[As the **national debt** grows, we are more
**beholden to creditors** around the globe and have **fewer resources**
to invest in **strength** at home]{.underline}. The national debt
[presents a clear threat to the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [to operate an efficient and effective response
for its **national defense**]{.underline}."

A large and growing national [debt poses **long-term**]{.underline}
economic and [security risks to the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. [Those risks are
becoming **more evident**. In]{.underline} fiscal year
([FY]{.underline}) [2024, the U.S. spent \$882 billion on **interest

billion, plus **billions more** in other important national security
areas. If left unchecked, high debt service costs will eventually
**crowd out other priorities**]{.underline}, potentially undermining the
ability to protect our nation and support our allies.

Increased [debt service costs will crowd out public investments in

[Heightened **dysfunction** of the **federal budget process** only

[The U.S. will need the **budgetary capacity** to meet emerging national
security challenges]{.underline} in a changing world.

[The U.S. can only continue our global leadership in defense readiness
and intelligence if we get our fiscal house in order]{.underline}.

Federal Borrowing Costs Risk Crowding Out National Defense Spending

[As the **largest discretionary spending category**, national defense is
especially exposed to **budgetary pressures**]{.underline}, creating
tensions between the country's ability to meet challenges in a
fast-changing security landscape and plan [in a **fiscally constrained

[In FY2024, the federal government spent **more** on interest payments

National Security Requires Dependable Investments and a Predictable

[Over the past decade, national security leaders have faced

[Broader failure to address the federal debt has also impacted national

**[A]{.underline}**ct [of 2011 found adverse impacts to U.S. military

closure of 12 **combat squadrons**, and a **mismatch in funding** needs

to cut the defense base to reduce the long-term impacts sequestration
would have on troops deployed in combat zones. As the debt grows, a
threat remains that further budgetary shortfalls could leave the U.S.
with gaps needed to maintain military and intelligence readiness.

High Public Debt May Restrict Our Flexibility to Respond to Future
Threats

In the 2024 Annual Intelligence Assessment, the U.S. intelligence
community placed the "increasingly fragile and unstable global
environment" as a top national security threat. Meanwhile, the Atlantic
Council's ten-year projection suggests "a resurgence of nuclear weapons
proliferation" as a top risk. [While the U.S. typically provides
**military assistance** annually for allies to bolster security
cooperation and counter threats, these costs are **highly variable**. In
FY2023 and 2024, for example, the U.S. provided nearly **\$136 billion**
in military assistance to]{.underline} **[Ukraine]{.underline}**,
**[Israel]{.underline}**, [and **Taiwan**]{.underline}. With increased
risks from actors such as China and Russia challenging the established
global order, the U.S. must continue to bolster its own security and
support its allies across the world.

It is vital that we have the budgetary capacity necessary to meet future
threats when they arise. [As **geopolitical pressures** mount, lawmakers

[Recent estimates from **Brown**]{.underline} University's Costs of War

**Iraq** along with associated **veterans benefits**---largely **deficit

#### 5. [WARMING]{.underline}. 

**McCoy '24** \[Alfred; Harrington professor of history at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison. September 20; "Will climate change
bring an end to America's world order?" Salon,
https://www.salon.com/2024/09/20/will-climate-change-bring-an-end-to-americas-world-order_partner/;
//ff\]

Once upon a time in America, we could all argue about whether or not
[U.S. **global power** was **declining**]{.underline}. Now, [most
observers have **little doubt** that the **end** is just a matter of
**timing and circumstance**]{.underline}. Ten years ago, I predicted
that, by 2025, it would be all over for American power, a
then-controversial comment that's commonplace today. Under President
Donald Trump, the once "indispensable nation" that won World War II and
built a new world order has become dispensable indeed.

The decline and fall of American global power is, of course, nothing
special in the great sweep of history. After all, in the 4,000 years
since humanity's first empire formed in the Fertile Crescent, at least
200 empires have risen, collided with other imperial powers, and in time
collapsed. In the past century alone, two dozen modern imperial states
have fallen and the world has managed just fine in the wake of their
demise.

The global order didn't blink when the sprawling Soviet empire imploded
in 1991, freeing its 15 "republics" and seven "satellites" to become 22
newly capitalist nations. Washington took that epochal event largely in
stride. There were no triumphal demonstrations, in the tradition of
ancient Rome, with manacled Russian captives and their plundered
treasures paraded down Pennsylvania Avenue. Instead, a Manhattan
real-estate developer bought a 20-foot chunk of the Berlin Wall for
display near Madison Avenue, a sight barely noticed by busy shoppers.

For those trying to track global trends for the next decade or two, the
real question is not the fate of American global hegemony, but the
future of the world order it began building at the peak of its power,
not in 1991, but right after World War II. For the past 75 years,
Washington's global dominion has rested on a "delicate duality." The raw
realpolitik of U.S. military bases, multinational corporations, CIA
coups and foreign military interventions has been balanced, even
softened, by a surprisingly liberal world order --- with sovereign
states meeting as equals at the United Nations, an international rule of
law that muted armed conflict, a World Health Organization that actually
eradicated epidemic diseases which had plagued humanity for generations,
and a developmental effort led by the World Bank that lifted 40% of
humanity out of poverty.

Some observers remain supremely confident that Washington's world order
can survive the inexorable erosion of its global power. Princeton
political scientist G. John Ikenberry, for example, has essentially
staked his reputation on that debatable proposition. As U.S. decline
first became apparent in 2011, he argued that Washington's ability to
shape world politics would diminish, but "the liberal international
order will survive and thrive," preserving its core elements of
multilateral governance, free trade and human rights. Seven years later,
amid a rise of anti-global nationalists across significant parts of the
planet, he remains optimistic that the American-made world order will
endure because international issues such as climate change make its
"protean vision of interdependence and cooperation... more important as
the century unfolds."

This sense of guarded optimism is widely shared among foreign policy
elites in the New York-Washington corridor of power. The president of
the influential Council on Foreign Relations, Richard Haass, has
typically argued that the "post-Cold War order cannot be restored, but
the world is not yet on the edge of a systemic crisis." Through deft
diplomacy, Washington could still save the planet from "deeper disarray"
or even "trends that spell catastrophe."

But is it true that the decline of the planet's "sole superpower" (as it
was once known) will no more shake the present world order than the
Soviet collapse once did? To explore what it takes to produce just such
an implosion of a world order, it's necessary to turn to history --- to
the history, in fact, of collapsing imperial orders and a changing
planet.

Admittedly, such analogies are always imperfect, yet what other guide to
the future do we have but the past? Among its many lessons: that world
orders are far more fundamental than we might imagine and that their
uprooting requires a perfect storm of history's most powerful forces.
Indeed, the question of the moment should be: [Is **climate change** now
gathering **sufficient destructive force** to]{.underline} ~~cripple~~
\[[end]{.underline}\] [Washington's liberal **world order** and create
an **opening** for Beijing]{.underline}'s decidedly illiberal one [or
possibly even a **new world** in which such orders will be
unrecognizable?]{.underline}

\[PARAGRAPH BREAKS PAUSE\]

Empires and world orders Despite the aura of awe-inspiring power they
give off, empires have often been the ephemeral creations of an
individual conqueror like Alexander the Great or Napoleon that fade fast
after his death or defeat. World orders are, by contrast, far more
deeply rooted. They are resilient global systems created by a
convergence of economic, technological and ideological forces. On the
surface, they entail a diplomatic entente among nations, while at a
deeper level they entwine themselves within the cultures, commerce and
values of countless societies. World orders influence the languages
people speak, the laws they live by, and the ways they work, worship,
and even play. World orders are woven into the fabric of civilization
itself. To uproot them takes an extraordinary event or set of events,
even a global catastrophe. Looking back over the last millennium, old
orders die and new ones arise when a cataclysm, marked by mass death or
a maelstrom of destruction, coincides with some slower yet sweeping
social transformation. Since the age of European exploration started in
the 15th century, some 90 empires, large and small, have come and gone.
In those same centuries, however, there have been only three major world
orders --- the Iberian age (1494-1805), the British imperial era
(1815-1914) and the Washington world system (1945-2025). Is climate
change now gathering sufficient destructive force to cripple
Washington's liberal world order and create an opening for Beijing's
decidedly illiberal one? Such global orders are not the mere imaginings
of historians trying, so many decades or centuries later, to impose some
logic upon a chaotic past. Those three powers --- Spain, Britain and the
United States --- consciously tried to reorder their worlds for, they
hoped, generations to come through formal agreements --- the Treaty of
Tordesillas in 1494, the Congress of Vienna in 1815 and the San
Francisco conference that drafted the U.N. charter in 1945. Should
Beijing succeed Washington as the world's preeminent power, future
historians will likely look back on its Belt and Road Forum, which
brought 130 nations to Beijing in 2017, as the formal start of the
Chinese era. Each of these treaties shaped a world in the most
fundamental ways, articulating universal principles that would define
the nature of nations and the rights of all humans within them for
decades to come. Over this span of 500 years, these three world orders
conducted what could be seen, in retrospect, as a continuing debate over
the nature of human rights and the limits of state sovereignty over vast
stretches of the planet. In their spread across disparate lands, world
orders become coalitions of contending, even contradictory, social
forces --- diverse peoples, rival nations, competing classes. When
deftly balanced, such a system can survive for decades, even centuries,
by subsuming those contending forces within broadly shared interests. As
tensions swell into contradictions, however, a cataclysm in the form of
war or natural disaster can catalyze otherwise simmering conflicts ---
allowing challenges from rival powers, revolts by subordinate social
orders, or both. The Iberian age During the last thousand years, the
first of these transformative cataclysms was certainly the Black Death
of 1350, one of history's greatest waves of mass mortality via disease,
this one spread by rats carrying infected lice from Central Asia across
Europe. In just six years, this pandemic killed up to 60% of Europe's
population, leaving some 50 million dead. As lesser yet still lethal
epidemics recurred at least eight times over the next half-century, the
world's population fell sharply from an estimated 440 million to just
350 million people, a crash from which it would not fully recover for
another two centuries. Historians have long argued that the plague
caused lasting labor shortages, slashing revenues on feudal estates and
so forcing aristocrats to seek alternative income through warfare. The
result: a century of incessant conflict across France, Italy and Spain.
But few historians have explored the broader geopolitical impact of this
demographic disaster. After nearly a millennium, it seems to have ended
the Middle Ages with its system of localized states and relatively
stable regional empires, while unleashing the gathering forces of
merchant capital, maritime trade and military technology to, quite
literally, set the world in motion. As Tamerlane's horsemen swept across
Central Asia and the Ottoman Turks occupied southeast Europe (while also
capturing Constantinople, the Byzantine empire's capital, in 1453),
Iberia's kingdoms turned seaward for a century of exploration. Not only
did they extend their growing imperial power to four continents (Africa,
Asia and both Americas), but they also created the first truly global
order worthy of the name, commingling commerce, conquest and religious
conversion on a global scale. The Black Death ended the Middle Ages with
its system of localized states and relatively stable regional empires,
while unleashing the gathering forces of merchant capital, maritime
trade and military technology to literally set the world in motion.
Starting in 1420, thanks to advances in navigation and naval warfare,
including the creation of the agile caravel gunship, Portuguese mariners
pushed south, rounded Africa, and eventually built some 50 fortified
ports from Southeast Asia to Brazil. This would allow them to dominate
much of world trade for more than a century. Somewhat later, Spanish
conquistadors followed Columbus across the Atlantic to conquer the Aztec
and Incan empires, occupying significant parts of the Americas. Just
weeks after Columbus completed his first voyage in 1493, Pope Alexander
VI issued a decree awarding the Spanish crown perpetual sovereignty over
all lands west of a mid-Atlantic line so "that barbarous nations be
overthrown and brought to the \[Catholic\] faith." He also affirmed an
earlier papal bull (Romanus Pontifex, 1455) that gave Portugal's king
rights to "subdue all Saracens and pagans" east of that line, "reduce
their persons to perpetual slavery," and "possess these islands, lands,
harbors, and seas." To settle just where that line actually lay, Spanish
and Portuguese diplomats met for months in 1494 in the tiny city of
Tordesillas for high-stakes negotiations, producing a treaty that split
the non-Christian world between them and officially launched the Iberian
age. In its expansive definition of national sovereignty, this treaty
allowed European states to acquire "barbarous nations" by conquest and
make entire oceans into a mare clausum, or a closed sea, through
exploration. This diplomacy would also impose a rigid
religious-cum-racial segregation upon humanity that would persist for
another five centuries. Even as they rejected Iberia's global land grab,
other European states contributed to the formation of that distinctive
world order. King Francis I of France typically demanded "to see the
clause of Adam's will by which I should be denied my share of the
world." Nonetheless, he accepted the principle of European conquest and
later sent navigator Giovanni da Verrazzano to explore North America and
claim what became Canada for France. A century after, when Protestant
Dutch mariners defied Catholic Portugal's mare clausum by seizing one of
its merchant ships off Singapore, their jurist Hugo Grotius argued
persuasively, in his 1609 treatise \"Mare Liberum\" ("Freedom of the
Seas"), that the sea like the air is "so limitless that it cannot become
a possession of any one." For the next 400 years, the twin diplomatic
principles of open seas and conquered colonies would remain foundational
for the international order. Sustained by mercantile profits and
inspired by missionary zeal, this diffuse global order proved
surprisingly resilient, surviving for three full centuries. By the start
of the 18th century, however, Europe's absolutist states had descended
into destructive internecine conflicts, notably the War of Spanish
Succession (1701-1714) and a global Seven Years War (1756-1763).
Moreover, the royal chartered companies --- British, Dutch and French
--- that by then ran those empires were proving ever less capable of
effective colonial rule and increasingly inept at producing profits.
After two centuries of dominion, the French East India Company
liquidated in 1794 and its venerable Dutch counterpart collapsed only
five years later. Final fatal blows to these absolutist regimes were
delivered by the American, French and Haitian revolutions that erupted
between 1776 and 1804. The British imperial era The British imperial age
emerged from the cataclysmic Napoleonic Wars that unleashed the
transformative power of England's innovations in industry and global
finance. For 12 years, 1803 to 1815, those wars proved to be a Black
Death-style maelstrom that roiled Europe, leaving six million dead in
their wake and reaching India, Southeast Asia and the Americas. By the
time the Emperor Napoleon disappeared into exile, France, stripped of
many of its overseas colonies, had been reduced to secondary status in
Europe, while its erstwhile ally, Spain, was so weakened that it would
soon lose its Latin American empire. Propelled by a tumultuous and
historic economic transformation, Britain suddenly faced no serious
European rival and found itself free to create and oversee a bifurcated
world order in which sovereignty remained a right and reality only in
Europe and parts of the Americas, while much of the rest of the planet
was subject to imperial dominion. Admittedly, the destruction caused by
the Napoleonic wars may seem relatively modest compared to the
devastation of the Black Death, but the long-term changes engendered by
Britain's industrial revolution and the finance capitalism that emerged
from those wars proved far more compelling than the earlier era's
merchant companies and missionary endeavors. From 1815 to 1914, London
presided over an expanding global system marked by industry, capital
exports and colonial conquests, all spurred by the integration of the
planet via railroad, steamship, telegraph and ultimately radio. In
contrast to the weak royal companies of the earlier age, this version of
imperialism combined modern corporations with direct colonial rule in a
way that allowed for far more efficient exploitation of local resources.
No surprise, then, that some scholars have called Britain's century of
dominion the "first age of globalization." From 1815 to 1914, London
presided over an expanding global system marked by industry, capital
exports and colonial conquests, all spurred by the integration of the
planet via railroad, steamship, telegraph and radio. While British
industry and finance were quintessentially modern, its imperial age
extended key international principles of centuries past, even if in grim
secular guise. While the Dutch doctrine of "freedom of the seas" allowed
the British navy to rule the waves, the earlier religious justification
for domination was replaced by a racialist ideology that legitimized
European efforts to conquer and colonize the half of humanity whom the
imperialist poet Rudyard Kipling branded the "lesser breeds." Although
the 1815 Congress of Vienna officially launched the British era by
eliminating France as a rival, the 1885 Berlin Conference on Africa
truly defined the age. Much as the Portuguese and Spanish had done at
Tordesillas in 1494, the 14 imperial powers (including the United
States) present at Berlin four centuries later justified carving up the
entire continent of Africa by proclaiming a self-serving commitment "to
watch over the preservation of the native tribes and to care for the
improvement of the conditions of their moral and material well-being."
Just as that designation of Africans as "native tribes" instead of
"nations" or "peoples" denied them both sovereignty and human rights, so
the British century witnessed eight empires subjecting nearly half of
humanity to colonial rule premised on racial inferiority. Only a century
after its founding, however, the contradictions that lurked within Great
Britain's global rule erupted, thanks to the way that two cataclysmic
world wars coincided with the long-term rise of anti-colonial
nationalism to create our current world order. The alliance system among
rival empires proved volatile, exploding into murderous conflicts in
1914 and again in 1939. Worse yet, industrialization had spawned the
battleship and the airship as engines for warfare of unprecedented range
and destructive power, while modern science would also create nuclear
weapons with the power to potentially destroy the planet itself.
Meanwhile, the colonies that covered nearly half the globe refused to
abide by the institutionalized denial of the very liberty, humanity, and
sovereignty that Europe prized for itself. While most of the 15 million
combat deaths in World War I emerged from the destructive nature of
trench warfare on the western front in France (compounded by 100 million
fatalities worldwide from an influenza pandemic), World War II spread
its devastation globally, killing more than 60 million people and
ravaging cities across Europe and Asia. With Europe struggling to
recover, its empires could no longer constrain colonial cries for
independence. Just two decades after the war's end, the six European
overseas empires that had dominated much of Asia and Africa for five
centuries gave way to 100 new nations. Washington's world order In the
aftermath of history's most destructive war, the United States used its
unmatched power to form the Washington world system. American deaths in
World War II numbered 418,000, but those losses paled before the 24
million dead in Russia, the 20 million more in China, and the 19 million
in Europe. While industries across Europe, Russia and Japan were damaged
or destroyed and much of Eurasia was ravaged, the United States found
itself left with a vibrant economy on a war footing and half the world's
industrial capacity. With much of Europe and Asia suffering from mass
hunger, the swelling surpluses of American agriculture fed a famished
humanity. Washington's visionary world order took form at Bretton Woods,
New Hampshire, in 1944. There, 44 Allied nations created an
international financial system exemplified by the World Bank and then,
at San Francisco in 1945, by a U.N. charter to form a community of
sovereign nations. In a striking blow for human progress, this new order
resoundingly rejected the religious and racial divisions of the previous
five centuries, proclaiming in the U.N.'s Universal Declaration of Human
Rights the "equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human
family," which "should be protected by the rule of law." Within a decade
after the end of World War II, Washington had 500 overseas military
bases ringing Eurasia, a chain of mutual defense pacts and a
globe-girding armada of nuclear-armed warships and strategic bombers.
Within a decade after the end of World War II, Washington also had 500
overseas military bases ringing Eurasia and a chain of mutual defense
pacts stretching from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to
the Australia, New Zealand, United States Security Treaty (ANZUS), and a
globe-girding armada of nuclear-armed warships and strategic bombers. To
exercise its version of global dominion, Washington retained the
17th-century Dutch doctrine of "freedom of the seas," later extending it
even to space where, for more than half a century, its military
satellites have orbited without restraint. Just as the British imperial
system was far more pervasive and powerful than its Iberian predecessor,
so Washington's world order went beyond both of them, becoming
rigorously systematic and deeply embedded in every aspect of planetary
life. While the 1815 Congress of Vienna was an ephemeral gathering of
two dozen diplomats whose influence faded within a decade, the United
Nations and its 193 member states have, for nearly 75 years, sustained
44,000 permanent staff to supervise global health, human rights,
education, law, labor, gender relations, development, food, culture,
peacekeeping and refugees. In addition to such broad governance, the
U.N. also hosts treaties that are meant to regulate sea, space and the
climate. Not only did the Bretton Woods conference create a global
financial system, but it also led to the formation of the World Trade
Organization that regulates commerce among 124 member states. You might
imagine, then, that such an extraordinarily comprehensive system,
integrated into almost every aspect of international intercourse, would
be able to survive even major upheavals.

Cataclysm and collapse

Yet there is mounting evidence that [climate change, as it accelerates,
is creating the **basis** for the sort of **cataclysm** that will be
capable of **shaking** even such a **deeply rooted world
order**]{.underline}. The cascading effects of global warming will be
ever more evident, not in the distant future of 2100 (as once thought),
but within just 20 years, impacting the lives of most adults alive
today.

Last October, [scientists with the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change issued a "doomsday report," warning that humanity had
just **12 years left**]{.underline} to cut carbon emissions by a
striking 45% or the world's temperature would rise by at least 1.5
degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels by about 2040. This, in turn,
[would bring significant **coastal flooding**, ever more **intense
storms**, fierce **drought**, **wildfires** and **heat waves** with
damage that might add up to as much as **\$54 trillion** --- well over
**half** the current size of the **global economy**]{.underline}. Within
a few decades after that, global warming would, absent heroic measures,
reach a dangerous 2 degrees Celsius, with even more devastation.

The cascading effects of global warming will be ever more evident, not
in the distant future of 2100 (as once thought), but within just 20
years, impacting the lives of most adults alive today.

In January, scientists, using new data from sophisticated floating
sensors, reported that the world's oceans were heating 40% faster than
estimated only five years earlier, unleashing powerful storms with
frequent coastal flooding. Sooner or later, sea levels might rise by a
full foot thanks to nothing but the thermal expansion of existing
waters. Simultaneous reports showed that [the rise in world air
temperature has already made the last five years the **hottest in

**raging wildfires** to the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited

level of eight inches by 2050 could double coastal flooding in tropical
latitudes --- with devastating impacts on millions of people in
low-lying Bangladesh and the mega-cities of southeastern Asia from
Mumbai to Saigon and Guangzhou. Meltwater from Greenland is also
disrupting the North Atlantic's "overturning circulation" that regulates
the region's climate and is destined to produce yet more extreme weather
events. Meanwhile, Antarctic meltwater will trap warm water under the
surface, accelerating the break-up of the West Antarctic ice shelf and
contributing to a rise in ocean levels that could hit 20 inches by 2100.

In sum, [an **ever-escalating** tempo of **climate change** over the
coming decades is likely to produce **massive damage** to the
infrastructure that **sustains human life**]{.underline}. Seven hundred
years later, humanity could be facing another catastrophe on the scale
of the Black Death, one that might, once again, set the world in motion.

The geopolitical impact of climate change may be felt most immediately
in the Mediterranean basin, home to 466 million people, where
temperatures in 2016 had already reached 1.3 degrees Celsius above
pre-industrial levels. (The current global average was still around 0.85
degrees.) This means that the threat of devastating drought is going to
be brought to a historically dry region bordered by sprawling deserts in
North Africa and the Middle East. In a telling example of how climate
catastrophe can erase an entire world order, around 1200 B.C. the
eastern Mediterranean suffered a protracted drought that "caused crop
failures, dearth, and famine," sweeping away Late Bronze Age
civilizations like the Greek Mycenaean cities, the Hittite empire and
the New Kingdom in Egypt.

From 2007 to 2010, ongoing global warming caused the "worst three-year
drought" in Syria's recorded history --- precipitating unrest marked by
"massive agricultural failures" that drove 1.5 million people into city
slums and, next, by a devastating civil war that, starting in 2011,
forced five million refugees to flee that country. As more than a
million migrants, led by 350,000 Syrians, poured into Europe in 2015,
the European Union plunged into political crisis. Anti-immigrant parties
soon gained in popularity and power across the continent while Britain
voted for its own chaotic Brexit.

Projecting the Middle East's history, ancient and modern, into the near
future, the ingredients for a regional crisis with serious global
ramifications are clearly present. Just last month, the U.S. National
Intelligence Council warned that "climate hazards," such as "heat waves
\[and\] droughts," were increasing "social unrest, migration and
interstate tension in countries such as Egypt, Ethiopia, Iraq and
Jordan."

If we translate those sparse words into a future scenario, sometime
before 2040 when average global warming is likely to reach that
dangerous 1.5 degrees Celsius mark, the Middle East will likely
experience a disastrous temperature rise of 2.3 degrees. Such intense
heat will produce protracted droughts far worse than the one that
destroyed those Bronze Age civilizations, potentially devastating
agriculture and sparking water wars among the nations that share the
Tigris and Euphrates rivers, while sending yet more millions of refugees
fleeing toward Europe. Under such unprecedented pressure, far-right
parties might take power across the continent and the EU could rupture
as every nation seals its borders. NATO, suffering a "severe crisis"
since the Trump years, might simply implode, creating a strategic vacuum
that finally allows Russia to seize Ukraine and the Baltic states.

[As tensions rise on both sides of the Atlantic, the **U.N.** could
be]{.underline} ~~paralyzed~~ \[**[powerless]{.underline}**\] [by a
**great-power deadlock** in the **Security Council** as well as growing

Most fundamentally, China has subordinated human rights to an
overarching vision of expanding state sovereignty, vehemently rejecting
foreign criticism of its treatment of its Tibetan and Uighur minorities,
just as it ignores equally egregious domestic transgressions by
countries like North Korea and the Philippines. [If **climate change**
does]{.underline}, in fact, [spark **mass migrations**, then China's
untrammeled nationalism]{.underline}, with its implicit hostility to the

Practice Theory Reinterpretation of Gramsci," British Sociological
Association, https://doi.org/10.1177/00380385231178643; //ff\]

Gramsci offers a way of characterizing relations through his notion of
historic bloc. [A 'historic bloc']{.underline} (Gramsci, 1971: 384) [is
the amalgamation of social and material forces through which
**domination** (of a particular party) is **maintained**]{.underline}.
Gramsci introduces the concept of a historic bloc as [a basic condition
for the **existence** of dominant entities]{.underline}. Dominant
entities such as the bourgeoisie enjoy a resource-rich existence and
material as well as socially established privilege. The coalitions that
are opposed to dominant entities (e.g. the proletariat) are oppressed
and characterized by an inadequate access to resources: they are not
sustained by a historic bloc. In encompassing the interdependency of and
reciprocal relations among cultural, political and material forces, the
nexus-like composition of a historic bloc parallels that of a social
phenomenon conceptualized as a constellation of practices and material
arrangements.

Alliances within the historic bloc establish consent to a certain social
order, a 'common sense' (Gramsci, 1971: 685). This common sense is, in
practice vocabulary, both developed and expressed through the repeated
performance of normatively acceptable or required actions. These
effectively 'lock' (Newell et al., 2015: 537) practitioners into
accepting the status quo, which is normatively accepted or required but
not brutally coerced (Sanne, 2002). In the case we analyse below, these
performances and patterns are unsustainable ones. [While **hegemony**
has often been proposed as a **prerequisite** for the maintenance of
entrenched, **long-lasting domination**]{.underline} (e.g. Schulzke,
2015), [the interesting point here is that dominance **cannot be upheld
by one entity alone**. Instead, it is support from **relationships**
built between **allies** and from **opposition** to other coalitioned
forces that can **make or break** the domination of one entity over the
other]{.underline}. Gramsci also holds that [**counterhegemony** is an
indispensable dynamic in political relationships. Counterhegemony is an
**oppressed entity trying to establish itself**, in the process
triggering **antagonistic relationships** with the **hegemonic entity**
and its historic bloc. As in politics, dominance requires
**suppression** and **opposition**. Bringing the argument back to
**sustainability**: **subordinate sustainable** practices often **oppose
dominant unsustainable** ones and **struggle to assert
themselves**]{.underline}.

//aka

One of the ways in which Donald Trump's regime obscures and distracts is
by drawing our eyes constantly to the US -- its raw power to intimidate
and bully other nations, and its vast financial heft in wielding soft
power through organisations such as USAid.

[But at the same time as Trump projects his agenda on to the world
stage, he is **withdrawing the US from the world and reducing its role
to its bare bones**]{.underline} -- an imperial power that blatantly
picks and chooses how to engage based on its alliances and interests.
American taxpayer money is ever so precious on the one hand, but on the
other can be profligately spent on proposals to take over an entire
territory in Gaza and send billions in aid to Israel. [This
is]{.underline} not isolationism, it is **[unilateralism.]{.underline}**

[In doing so, the US, despite its domination of the headlines, is
**withdrawing from a world** from which it has been receding for a long
time as a moral, military and economic force into selective
engagement.]{.underline} The arc of that recession is wide. It was "the
end of history" in the early 90s, when the end of the cold war was
predicted to herald a new world in which liberal capitalist values
dominated under globalisation and free trade, and democracy flourished
as the Soviet Union and its autocracies across eastern Europe collapsed.
[But in the three decades since, the US expanded then caved in on
itself.]{.underline}

The country kicked off that period with several active military
deployments and campaigns across the Middle East and south Asia under
the guise of establishing security and democratic rights, as well as a
robust system of broadly observed sanctions on deviant parties. It ended
it with a hasty retreat from Afghanistan with zero of its objectives
met, a drawdown of troops in Iraq and a host of empty ambassadorships
across the world. [On 7 October 2023, the US had no ambassadors in
Israel, Egypt or Lebanon.]{.underline} A major cause of this was the
Iraq war, as the quagmire the US found itself in "sucked the oxygen out
of the administration's foreign policy agenda". [A few months before
Trump came to power for a second term, a foreign policy veteran in
Washington told me that the state department was stuck in the past,
unable to pivot and finesse its new role in the world]{.underline}, and
compared its frozen nostalgia to "watching old cowboy movies on repeat".

[In the meantime, the world simply changed. America's standing as a
superpower is predicated on a sort of status quo that assumes that no
other nations should accumulate enough economic and strategic weight to
create their own unilateralism, or a version of multipolarity that
undercuts the US.]{.underline} A brief survey of data: China is Africa's
largest trading partner and creditor; 20% of the continent's exports go
to China, and 16% of its imports come from China. [China's foreign
direct investment weaves itself into the very development of the region,
with a portion strategically going towards transportation, mining,
energy and infrastructure. **China has been a driver of a larger shift**
-- south-south trade is increasing, as north-north trade is declining,
particularly since the global financial crisis, creating a more
integrated and mutually dependent world south of the equator and east of
the Atlantic.]{.underline}

[Middle Eastern powerhouses]{.underline} (to me, one of the most
overlooked stories of how the global political economy is changing) [are
using their treasure chests to become global players that sit at the top
of the capital investment structure.]{.underline} Trump is wooing Saudi
Arabia, saying after his inauguration that he would make Riyadh his
first foreign visit if the kingdom executed a promise to buy half a
trillion dollars of US goods. Qatar is investing billions in the US. And
the United Arab Emirates' sovereign wealth fund has earmarked the US as
a top investment destination. [These states are expanding regionally
too, forging ties with Turkey in a quest, according to the Atlantic
Council, "to gain strategic autonomy from the west and distribute risks
by hedging against changes in US policy toward Turkey and the Gulf's
neighbourhood", as "**the global economy's centre of gravity shifts
toward the Indo-Pacific region".** That translates into real political
power.]{.underline}

[This shifting centre of gravity and the more assured dispersal of
political and economic power have knock-on effects on the US's residual
foreign policy agenda.]{.underline} Russia's evasion of sanctions has in
part been enabled by trade through China, the UAE and Turkey, countries
that are now too powerful and incorporated into the world economy to be
slapped with effective secondary sanctions to deter them from
undermining efforts to isolate Russia. The Biden administration's recent
declaration of genocide in Sudan, for example, and sanctions on its
warring parties will probably have little effect in limiting the
involvement of weapons suppliers, from Iran to the UAE, which either
fall outside the US's sphere of enforcement, or which are US allies
simply too powerful to be disciplined.

The main culprit for that diminution of the US's capability to force and
persuade is that very same globalisation that would have appointed the
US as the CEO of Globe Inc, spreading its economic and political ethos.
[Free movement of capital, lower barriers to trade, deregulated cheap
labour and the diversification of national income streams have shaped a
world that can no longer be divided into isolated outlaw "axes of evil"
and pliant regimes. The international community is now divided into
those with economic heft and global trading alliances, and those that
don't have either, but now have more options to become client states
away from the US's sphere of influence]{.underline}. And with Trump in
power, **[divestment from his administration's volatile and unreliable
policies and turning towards more stable allies would be the wise choice
for any government with that ability to "hedge".]{.underline}** He is
moving too fast, breaking too many things, and unleashing such
reactionary forces that the outlook in four years' time looks less
likely to be one where a resurgent Democratic party mounts a successful
challenge and restoration, and more that Trumpism will continue by other
means.

[And so he takes the US with him, roiled and destabilised, into a world
where its ability to advance whatever agenda it wishes at any time is
increasingly undermined by its own moral and political collapse, and by
the rise of other nations and arrangements that are **rewriting the
global order.**]{.underline} It is the end of the end of history. A new
chapter begins -- nakedly transactional, more crowded, where political
power is far more up for grabs. [Trump could, by withdrawing in parts
and aggressively asserting in others, create at once both a vacuum and a
provocation that could **catalyse that process. The irony is that as
Trump casts a large, dark shade, more and more of the world is coming
out of the US's shadow.**]{.underline}

[The **US** took over the **position** of postwar **imperialist**
hegemon and leader of the Anglo-Saxon camp when **Second** World War
came to a **close**]{.underline}. Of course, in this transformation as
supreme global arbiter, the US has [undergone many strategic policy
shifts with **ascending** and **descending** phases during the
**colonial** period and in the **postwar** neocolonial-neoliberal
phase]{.underline}. However, with the beginning of the 21st century,
especially after the world economic crisis or "global meltdown" of
2007-08, i[ts **stature** as world's leading manufacturer and biggest
trader has been **lost** to **China**]{.underline}. Following the sharp
decline in US gold reserve which was 75 percent of world total in 1945
to less than 20 percent as of now, [that **resulted** in a **loss** of
trust in dollar's **continuity** as world currency, has **unleashed** a
"de-dollarisation" trend too]{.underline}, in which China has its overt
and covert role. And of late, as a manifestation of the inability to
carry out the super-power [**responsibilities** incumbent on it
**including** the **maintenance** of around 750-800 military bases
across 80 countries of the **world**, US imperialism has been
backtracking from its international **commitments**]{.underline},
especially to UN-affiliated institutions, which, to an extent, were
political tools propped up by US itself that enabled it to carry on the
tasks as postwar neocolonial arbiter.

However, this [**irreversible** and **multidimensional** declining trend
of US imperialist **hegemony** is now accelerated **further** by the
second coming of Donald **Trump** as 47th US president]{.underline}.
Trump's policies, codified as "Trumpism" (or "Trumponomics"), are
characterised by extreme 'economic nationalism', the main pillars of
which are [assertion of US **hegemony** and boosting of the **economy**
through highly '**protectionist'** and '**isolationist'** trade policies
coupled with corporate tax-cuts, **business** deregulation and drastic
reduction in social **welfare** spending]{.underline}. Being symbolised
or encapsulated in the motto MAGA (Make America Great Again) and
"America First", Trumpism has [already sent shock-waves among
**traditional** US allies, especially among Anglo-Saxon imperialist
circles. Meanwhile the biggest-ever bullying tariffs **imposed** on
countries by Trump in tune with his **isolationist** and
**protectionist** perspective are now boomeranged as a looming threat
towards "**stagflation**" -- a situation of economic stagnation coupled
with high inflation -- on US itself]{.underline}. However, unable to
face retaliation from China coupled with pressure from US allies, [Trump
has forced to keep his unilateral tariff **move** in abeyance,
**engaging** in a series of trade talks with **countries**. Meanwhile,
domestic opposition to Trump's policies are surging on an
**unprecedented** scale]{.underline}. According to reports, compared to
the 2.4 percent growth in 2024, US GDP is going to be plummeted to its
half, i.e., 1.2 percent in 2025. Of course, while these developments and
their outcomes call for an objective evaluation, it would be in order
here to briefly situate the important policy shifts that marked both the
ascending and descending phases US imperialism over a century. This will
also enable to situate Trumpism from a concrete historical perspective.

[One **[outcome]{.mark}** of the [Donald Trump]{.mark} clown show is
that we can [safely say]{.mark} the **[period]{.mark}** of [U.S.
**hegemony**]{.mark} in the world has [come]{.mark} to [an]{.mark} end.
His erratic **[policies]{.mark}** and [bizarre **statements**]{.mark}
have undoubtedly convinced almost **[everyone]{.mark}** that the [United
States]{.mark} cannot be **[viewed]{.mark}** as a [reliable
ally]{.mark}]{.underline}, if not actually an
**[[enemy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In the case of Europe, [Trump is
threatening [military force]{.mark} against a [**longstanding**
ally]{.mark} and **[threatening]{.mark}** to [tax]{.mark}
**[imports]{.mark}** (tariffs) from the **[continent]{.mark}** for
reasons that don't make sense to anyone but **him**]{.underline}. The
same is true for our immediate neighbors, Canada and Mexico.
[[Trump]{.mark} has [shown **Latin** America]{.mark} that he wants to
[act]{.mark} like a [19th century **imperialist**]{.mark} towards
them]{.underline}.

The [U.S. allies in East Asia surely recognize that they [cannot
look]{.mark} to [the U.S]{.mark}. for support and will [reach
**accommodations** with **China**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And Africa now
recognizes the [[intense **racism**]{.mark} with which [Trump
regards]{.mark} the [continent]{.mark} after he [suspended
**PEPFAR**]{.mark}, a program that cost less [than 0.1 percent]{.mark}
of the [federal budget]{.mark} and has [**saved** tens of **millions**
of lives]{.mark}]{.underline}. Now that [China has an economy that is
[**already** one-third larger than the U.S. economy]{.mark}, and well
ahead of us [in **many** key]{.mark} [areas]{.mark}, like [electric
vehicles]{.mark}, [solar panels]{.mark}, [energy storage]{.mark}, and

[[the **struggle**]{.mark} of most of the [world **community**]{.mark}
with the [growing **egoism**]{.mark} of the [United States]{.mark} and
its unwillingness to **[recognize]{.mark}** other countries' interests
will be the [main driver]{.mark} of [current **global**]{.mark}
[developments]{.mark}]{.underline}. This has become particularly evident
following [[Donald Trump's **rise**]{.mark} to [power]{.mark}, as the
United States has [continued]{.mark} to [ignore]{.mark} its [**allies'**
interests]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[The U.S.'s **interests**]{.mark} have been **[transformed]{.mark}**
many times over the [past three **decades**]{.mark} depending on which
[part]{.mark} of the American [elite]{.mark}, pressure [groups]{.mark},
and the so-called "deep [state]{.mark}" is the most **[active]{.mark}**
and **[influential]{.mark}** at a [certain moment]{.mark}]{.underline}.
We can say that it is the balance of political forces, internal
political [**[struggle]{.mark}** and [**national** goals]{.mark} that
have [determined]{.mark} the [**important**]{.mark} directions of
[American **foreign** policy]{.mark}. Moreover, its foreign policy has
been [**excessively** subjected]{.mark} to the [internal
**considerations**]{.mark}, so foreign policy [actions]{.mark} have
often **[resulted]{.mark}** from internal [political
**struggle**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus, the increase in confrontation
with Russia is primarily determined by the logic of the struggle between
Trump and his domestic opponents. Meanwhile, from the perspective of the
USA's long-term interests, [such a [sharp **aggravation**]{.mark} of
[relationships]{.mark} with **[Russia]{.mark}** is
**[unprofitable]{.mark}**, since it drives the Russian Federation to
form coalitions with China, Iran and other countries. It is [more
**advantageous**]{.mark} for the [USA]{.mark} to [split]{.mark} its
[opponents]{.mark} and to prevent [**alliances** among
them]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is hard to tell whether Trump understands
this fact or not; regardless, his attempts to [improve
[relationships]{.mark} with Russia have [been **suppressed**]{.mark},
since [the **struggle**]{.mark} for [power]{.mark} within his own
[country **dictates**]{.mark} a [strategy]{.mark} of
**[confrontation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But the main thing for him is
his pre-election pledges and the hope that he will be elected to a
second presidential term if he fulfills them. Meanwhile, he seems
unaware of how this will affect America's future.

It have been [[**repeatedly** emphasized]{.mark} that the USA is
[**increasingly** losing]{.mark} its [**leadership**]{.mark}
role]{.underline} (see, e.g., Buchanan, Citation2002; Grinin,

Zakaria, Citation2008).Footnote1 It has also been pointed [out that this
**[weakening]{.mark}** has caused the [world "**disorder**]{.mark}" in
recent years; **[moreover]{.mark}**, it is the US\'s actions that
[**significantly** impact]{.mark} this [situation]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Grinin et al., Citation2017). The "disorder" has
[**[increased]{.mark}** even further since Trump **[came]{.mark}** to
power---in part because of his [aspiration]{.mark} to change
[long-standing]{.mark} **[relationships]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This
clearly reflects the aggravation of the abovementioned contradiction.

"Make America great again"---[[Trump\'s **slogan**]{.mark} is **[direct
evidence]{.mark}** of the [loss]{.mark} of America's **[former]{.mark}**
**[leadership]{.mark}** and shows that the **[situation]{.mark}** in the
[world]{.mark} will [exacerbate]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this context it
is important to consider the material basis of the power of contemporary
America, and whether it will support the goal to "make America great
again" or not. This article is devoted to analysis of this issue.

**[Trump has effectively acknowledged the world as a multipolar
one]{.underline}** --- the largest variable in the new world order is
the power dynamics that will be forged within the framework of
US-China-Russia relations

During his confirmation hearing on Jan. 15, US Secretary of State Marco
[Rubio indicated that the US will no longer prioritize the conventional
international order at the expense of US interests. He called the
postwar order not only "obsolete," but a "weapon being used against
us."]{.underline}

"While America too often prioritized the global order above our core
national interest, other nations continued to act the way nations have
always acted and always will: in what they perceive to be their best
interest," he said, calling the post-Cold War vision "a dangerous
delusion."

[In an interview with Megyn Kelly, Rubio said, "It's not normal for the
world to simply have a unipolar power. That was an anomaly. It was a
product of the end of the Cold War, but **eventually you were going to
reach back to a point where you had a multipolar world**, multi-great
powers in different parts of the planet."]{.underline}

Since his inauguration on Jan. 20, US President Donald [Trump has been
issuing domestic and foreign policies that directly prioritize the US
national interest while **forfeiting** and **retreating** from the
traditional US role in the international order.]{.underline}

Before his inauguration, [Trump made remarks suggesting that the US
would take control of Greenland, an autonomous territory in the Kingdom
of Denmark, and the Panama Canal. He also indicated that he'd like to
see Canada become the 51st state. After his inauguration, he made the
shocking announcement that the US would occupy Gaza, move Palestinians
out, and develop the region into a resort town. He's also expanding his
universal tariff regime that punishes nations one and all.]{.underline}

Trump shocked the world when it was revealed that he called Russian
President Vladimir Putin on Feb. 12 and worked out a peace deal for
Ukraine. The Trump administration indicated that the deal would include
the terms of acknowledging territory taken by Russia, Ukraine being
barred from joining NATO, and responsibility for Ukraine's security
being shifted to Europe after the war was ended. [Trump also indicated
that the US and Russia had been working on a deal before the
announcement, to the **exclusion of Ukraine and the rest of
Europe.**]{.underline}

[He's also indicated a **slash in defense spending.**]{.underline} The
US Department of Defense issued a statement on Feb. 19 announcing that
US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered "a review to identify
offsets from the Biden Administration's FY26 budget that could be
realigned from low-impact and low-priority Biden-legacy programs to
align with President Trump's America First priorities for our national
defense."

"The Department will develop a list of potential offsets that could be
used to fund these priorities, as well as to refocus the Department on
its core mission of deterring and winning wars. The offsets are targeted
at 8% of the Biden Administration's FY26 budget, totaling around US\$50
billion, which will then be spent on programs aligned with President
Trump's priorities," the statement continued.

If such a plan is implemented, [the current US defense budget of US\$850
billion will be cut by around US\$70 billion every year, being reduced
to around US\$560 billion in five years.]{.underline}

This is a much larger reduction than the defense budget cut in 2013 of
around US\$56 billion. Even amid such slashes, the [US has vowed
to]{.underline} construct an Iron Dome missile defense system for the US
and to [fortify its borders. A reduction in US troop presence abroad
**appears inevitable.**]{.underline}

[The policies that Trump has announced focus primarily on punitive
tariffs, expanding US territory, shutting down or downsizing agencies
for implementing US foreign policy, ending the war in Ukraine through a
peace deal with Russia, and a reduction of US troop presence abroad. All
policy initiatives are **openly pursuing a withdrawal or a reduction of
Washington's role in the international order**. It's a signal that the
US will **forfeit its role as the global hegemon**, a role that it has
maintained since the end of WWII.]{.underline}

Since the end of WWII, the US has fulfilled the role of a global
hegemon. It has opposed the 19th-century imperial world order based on
constructing colonies and expanding territory; advocated for free trade
and opened its domestic market to facilitate such trade; provided
financial and humanitarian aid to developing nations; served as the
world's police force; and checked the national authority of
anti-capitalist, authoritarian nations like China and the Soviet Union
(Russia).

Regarding such a role, the US has identified itself as a merciful
hegemon that maintains the liberal international order. It has also
referred to itself as an exceptional nation as the world's only
superpower, one that manages the liberal international order from a
transcendent position.

The US amplified its status as the global hegemon when the Soviet Union
collapsed in the early 1990s. Starting in 2008, however, it started
showing cracks. The 2008 global financial crisis coincided with the rise
of China. [This is when people started talking about a new era --- one
with **two superpowers.**]{.underline} Disputes surrounding the
expansion of NATO grew more heated, and Russia forcefully annexed the
Crimean Peninsula in 2014. A new cold war was clearly rearing its head.

When Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, Russia officially secured
a new sphere in the multifaceted new world order, one that Moscow and
Beijing advocate. The Russo-Ukrainian war strengthened the China-Russia
alliance and resulted in the failure of US-led sanctions against Russia.
Developing nations in the Southern Hemisphere, known as the "Global
South," mostly did not partake in the sanctions. [Their rise coincides
with a new economic ecosystem led by China and Russia, one that has
**cast a shadow over the US' global influence.**]{.underline}

[The policies Trump has announced before and after his inauguration
involving territory, tariffs, and peace deals are an acknowledgment of
this reality. This recognition is **consistent** with the US withdrawing
from the global stage and directly prioritizing its national
interests.]{.underline}

Remarks about taking over Greenland and the Panama Canal align with the
reality that the US is the superpower in the Americas. It also reflects
an expansionist revival of the Monroe Doctrine and the US refocusing its
efforts on the Western Hemisphere. [This refocus on the Western
Hemisphere indicates that while the US will retreat from the global
stage]{.underline}, it will consolidate its power and influence in the
Americas. This is evident in Trump's desire to take control of the
Panama Canal in order to drive out Chinese influence.

[The imposition of punitive tariffs is a **declaration** that the US
will forfeit its hegemonic role as the maintainer of free-trade
networks. It is also a declaration that the US will no longer completely
open its markets to the outside world.]{.underline} In his talks with
Russia over a peace deal in Ukraine, Trump has expressed openness to
accepting Russia's demands regarding the expansion of NATO and to the
Russian narrative that Ukraine is in the sphere of Russian influence.
[This can be seen as a major transition from the conventional
geopolitical stance of Washington, which up until now has refused to
acknowledge another superpower's sphere of influence.]{.underline}

After his meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Feb. 13,
Trump told reporters that he wishes to mediate talks between China and
Russia and to restore Russia's G7 membership.

"One of the first meetings I want to have is with President Xi of China,
President Putin of Russia. And I want to say: 'Let's cut our military
budget in half.' And we can do that. And I think we'll be able to,"
Trump said.

Ending the war in Ukraine was the biggest issue at the Munich Security
Conference that was held from Feb. 14 to 16. The organizers published a
post-conference report under the title, "Multipolarization."

"While the world may not yet be truly multipolar (and perhaps never will
be), we already live in a world **[shaped by
'multipolarization,]{.underline}**'" the report's foreword stated.

We don't know whether multipolarization will steer the world toward
conflict or peace. The US' role thus far has maintained a level of
global order and discipline, irrespective of how one feels about it. If
the US retreats from this role, there are concerns that we could slip
into an era of global chaos and conflict while the financial burdens
placed on other countries increase.

The Trump administration has judged that the conventional US role as a
global hegemon no longer serves the US. This is not a declaration that
the US will surrender its superiority. This is evident in the
administration's top foreign-policy priority: containing China. In a
column published by the Russian state-owned outlet RT International,
Dmitry Vitalyevich Trenin, a professor at Russia's Higher School of
Economics, wrote, "Washington's goal is to be primus inter pares ---
first among equals --- rather than a declining hegemon." It has
acknowledged other dogs in the fight, but it still aims to be top dog.

[Trump's negotiations with Putin regarding Ukraine were the first
indication that **he is willing to acknowledge a multipolar
world.**]{.underline} This could mark the advent of a new age of
imperialism, where the fate of weaker nations and national borders are
determined according to the interests of greater powers. We could be
seeing a Yalta 2.0 regime. Following the end of WWII, the leaders of the
US, the Soviet Union, and the UK gathered in Yalta, on the Crimean
Peninsula, to discuss each other's respective interests and spheres of
influence. Although it resulted in the Cold War, the Yalta regime
ultimately maintained a balance of powers and avoided another world war.

The largest variable in the new world order dictated by Trump's America
is the power dynamics and relationships that will be forged within the
framework of US-China-Russia relations. The US and Russia held
high-level talks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Feb. 18. Rather than peace
negotiations regarding Ukraine, the US seemed to view the talks as a
summit for normalizing relations with Russia. All eyes are on whether
the US will go for a "reverse Kissinger" strategy of warding off China
by improving ties with Russia. [How American allies in Europe and East
Asia, not to mention the "Global South" nations of the Middle East and
Southeast Asia, will respond to this power jockeying by Washington,
Beijing and Moscow also remains to be seen.]{.underline}

//ff\]

Recruitment Has Rebounded, but [it is **Too Early** to Declare
Victory]{.underline}

Last October, DoD announced that recruitment rose 12.5% in FY2024
compared to the previous year. With nearly all services meeting their
FY2024 goals, recruitment seems to be on the mend. However, [the problem
is **not resolved**, and it is **misleading** for the White House to
take **complete credit** for this progress]{.underline}.

[Recruiting is rebounding largely because the military services
**overhauled** their approaches]{.underline}. Last year, [the Army's
budget proposal included several **provisions** for improved recruiting.
The service increased its marketing and advertising budget]{.underline}
by 10% and dedicated \$675 million to enlistment bonuses and quick ship
contracts, where recruits report to basic training within a month of
enlistment. Similarly, over the last year, [the Navy created **more
opportunities** for a younger, tech-savvy recruitment pool by adding a
robotics specialization to its ranks. It also improved the **quality of
life**]{.underline} for its sailors, including by opening 24/7 fitness
centers and creating more access to parking. [The Air Force implemented
**similar incentives**, like reinstating its college loan repayment
program and accelerating naturalization opportunities]{.underline}.

The services started experiencing positive results from their efforts
more than a year ago---well before President Trump was elected in
November. During a media roundtable in October 2024, Major General
Johnny Davis, USAREC Commander, stated that "\[Recruiting momentum\]
really started in February 2024, after about a year of putting many of
these initiatives together, and it hasn't slowed down." In the same
discussion, Brigadier General Christopher Amrhein, Commander of the Air
Force Accessions Center (AFAC) and Air Force Recruiting Service (AFRS),
claimed that since 2023, over 10,000 recruits joined the Air Force and
Space Force due to the new policy changes and incentives. Similarly, the
Navy attributed its FY2024 success in part to its decision to expand
opportunities for sailors and marines. It is important to note that this
recruitment success occurred despite a U.S. economy that recovered from
the COVID-19 pandemic faster than expected. Accordingly, the services
overcame the normally predictable correlation between a strong economy
and poor recruitment, thereby developing an effective recruiting
strategy during periods of low unemployment.

While the White House plays a dominant role in shaping military and
defense policy, [the credit for recruiting rebounds belongs to the
**military services**, their respective recruiting commands, and most
importantly, the individual recruiters who interact with American youths
and communities each and every day. However, the **White House** is in
danger of **slowing**, and even **reversing**, this **momentum** if it
continues to **attack** current service members and those who are
**considering** military service]{.underline}.

[Huge **[National Debt]{.mark}** and Overall Debt **[Burden]{.mark}** of
**[Businesses]{.mark}** and the Population]{.underline}

The persistent fiscal deficit causes [[**growth** of the **national**
debt]{.mark}. At the [**federal** level]{.mark}, the debt is already
about \$[**21** trillion]{.mark}, which **[scares]{.mark}** some
[part]{.mark} of the **[elite]{.mark}**]{.underline}; however, the
majority is not yet concerned. [President **[Trump]{.mark}**, notably,
does **[not]{.mark}** seem to [**worry** much]{.mark} about
it]{.underline}. Moreover, the decision to reduce taxes will only
increase the size of the national debt. Before the 2008 crisis, the
debt-to-GDP ratio was approximately 60%, while it is currently more than
105%. [It is hard to say at what level the problem of debt will become
**[unbearable]{.mark}**---but it will [surely be **reached**]{.mark}
sooner or later. Obviously, due to the persistent **[fiscal]{.mark}**
deficit, the debt will [**continue** to grow]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Currently, the cost of servicing it amounts to much more than [\$300
billion a year. However, the Federal Reserve System (colloquially, "the
Fed") is likely to be raising **[rates]{.mark}** in the forthcoming
years, which means that the [**cost** of debt **servicing**]{.mark} may
**[increase]{.mark}**. Every 0.25% that the Fed adds to the
**[rate]{.mark}** means that the cost of debt **[servicing]{.mark}**
will increase by \$50 **billion** per year (i.e., by 1.2% of the total
budget)]{.underline}. External creditors (including China, Japan and
many others) hold about 30% of American debt (Treasuries). [While this
[attributes a **real** cost]{.mark} to the total debt, any hesitations
or doubts regarding the **[stability]{.mark}** of the [American monetary
system may lead **external** creditors]{.mark} to try to [get
rid]{.mark} of these debts, which might push the [whole **financial
system**]{.mark} into **[collapse]{.mark}**. The larger the debt, the
greater the risk to investors and lenders; thus, any doubts about the
security of treasury bonds may cause a sharp increase in their yields,
[complicating **budgetary**]{.mark} implementation and leading to
further **[accumulation]{.mark}** of debt]{.underline}. To avoid doubts
concerning the quality of US Treasuries, the Fed tries to reduce the
amount of debt on its balance sheets, since it bought \$4.5 trillion in
bonds.

[Many American financial and social institutions (including pension and
social funds) have invested in the national debt, which may cause
[**major** problems]{.mark}]{.underline}. First, the low yields of US
Treasuries makes it difficult to increase pensions in line with
inflation. [There have already been [**many** cases]{.mark} in which
pension funds have been unable to do so, and the number of such cases
will increase in the future. But if the yields of Treasuries are high,
then the [budget will "**burst** at the seams]{.mark}]{.underline}."
Second, if the country defaults on its national debt, the [pension
system may collapse, causing a social catastrophe]{.underline}. An
ageing population is a problem faced not only by the United States, but
many other countries (e.g., Goldstone, Citation2016); all face [[acute
**problems** with pensions and health **insurance**
coverage]{.underline}]{.mark}. The United States has peculiar features
in this respect (see below). Ageing and age-associated diseases will not
allow the U.S. budget to [significantly reduce these [**budgetary**
pressures]{.mark}]{.underline}. As pensioners and the elderly become an
increasingly important part of electorate, no politician or party will
be able to ignore their demands.

[As a result, the [problems of **fiscal** deficit]{.mark} and
[**national** debt may get worse]{.mark}, while the state must somehow
solve the [**problem** of pension
indexation]{.mark}]{.underline}.Footnote10 We should say that the debt
load in the USA is large not only at the federal, but also at the local
level; corporations and citizens are overburdened with debt as well. The
online debt clock for the United States tracks the gross national debt
as well as other economic variables. In April 2018, it showed a total
debt (including corporations and citizens) of almost \$70 trillion (on
average \$213,000 per person or \$836,000 per family). In this case,
only total US debt interest payments amount to \$2 trillion 623 billion,
or 13.4% of GDP (\$19.9 trillion). Generally, one-seventh of the U.S.
GDP is income from debt servicing, which is a largely parasitic sector.
The stronger is the parasitic credit sector, [the more capital is
diverted away from other sectors, and the economy generally grows
weaker]{.underline}. States and territories also have massive
debts.Footnote11 But here the growth opportunities are limited (since
the opportunities for emission within the states are limited). Thus,
there are periodic crises and numerous municipal units are forced to
raise local taxes. According to some reports, there are more than 400
cities whose financial situation makes them candidates for bankruptcy
(Rogers, Citation2017). In particular, there was a massive budget crisis
in the state of Illinois in 2017 (including its deeply indebted city of
Chicago). [*Thus, [the ]{.mark}***[problem]{.mark}** *of [increasing
]{.mark}***[indebtedness]{.mark}** *continues to* **[grow]{.mark}**

//aka

Since the end of the Second World War, the United States has sought to
guide, if not dominate, the international system. The rules-based order,
economic and trade liberalisation, and promotion of human rights were
hallmarks of this era.

[Today, however, America's role in the world is undergoing a **profound
transformation.** While many blame this shift on President Donald Trump,
his administration is more a symptom of a deeper reckoning with
America's self-image than the cause.]{.underline}

[There is a growing fatigue with global leadership -- a sense that the
costs outweigh the benefits and that the time has come to look inward.
This mindset is reshaping how the US engages with the world, with the
**consequences already emerging.**]{.underline}

As domestic concerns take precedence, the global order is shifting. [The
US is retreating from its traditional role as a stabilising force,
embracing a more unpredictable and self-interested
approach.]{.underline}

[Once again, American isolationism is **on the rise.** The Trump
administration has capitalised on this national identity crisis,
pursuing a foreign policy that prioritises immediate economic wins over
long-term strategy. It has disengaged from commitments it deems
outdated, recalibrating rather than revolutionising America's global
stance.]{.underline}

Trump has reduced alliances to transactional arrangements, shaped by a
populist scepticism towards traditional security partnerships. While
this sentiment is not new, [his administration has been the first to
**fully commit** to rewriting the rules.]{.underline}

Politicians and media figures have seized on public apathy, portraying
US military and financial support for allies as an unfair burden on
taxpayers. This has fuelled domestic resentment, particularly towards
Nato allies, who are increasingly viewed as beneficiaries of a "free
ride". [Alliances, once rooted in shared values, are now measured
through a cost-benefit lens.]{.underline}

[This shift has made traditional alliances vulnerable, susceptible to
changing public sentiment, disinformation campaigns and cyberwarfare. As
a result, some allies are exploring alternative security arrangements or
developing independent military capabilities, including nuclear
deterrence.]{.underline}

[New power centres]{.underline}

[**As the US steps back, other power centres are rising**. China's Belt
and Road Initiative and the Brics bloc offer alternatives to the US-led
order.]{.underline} While these initiatives lack the ideological
framework of the post-World War II system, [they appeal to nations
**disillusioned** with Western-dominated institutions.]{.underline}

However, neither China nor Russia has the economic or logistical
capacity to fully replace the US. Instead, [the world is moving towards
a model of great-power bargaining, where dominant states carve out
spheres of influence, often sidelining smaller nations in the
process.]{.underline}

The biggest losers in this transition are likely to be Europe and the
Global South. The European Union, which has long relied on American
security, now faces an uncertain geopolitical landscape without a
dependable US partner. Similarly, nations in the Global South, which
have historically depended on multilateral institutions for economic and
security aid, are becoming increasingly vulnerable to regional power
struggles.

[**Regionalism will experience a renaissance.** Organisations such as
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Mercosur and the African
Union will find cooperation and collaboration essential for survival in
this fragmented landscape.]{.underline}

Nuclear proliferation is likely to accelerate as countries seek to
safeguard themselves without relying on US deterrence. Meanwhile, global
trade routes, particularly maritime security, are becoming more
transactional, with US protection no longer guaranteed but offered at a
cost.

Even before Trump, the US military was stretched thin, struggling to
maintain dominance over global waterways. The Biden administration
quickly recognised these limitations, grappling with escalating Houthi
attacks in the Red Sea and an emboldened China in the South China Sea.

Leaked communications have revealed the apathy of senior US officials
towards maritime security. During the Houthi attacks, for instance, some
officials were reluctant to intervene, deeming the turmoil
inconsequential to US trade. This marks a shift: global trade
instability is no longer seen as a strategic threat to America.

Art of the deal

Under Trump, policy decisions increasingly prioritise public relations
victories over substantive, long-term agreements. This trend shapes US
engagement with multilateral organisations, which are being replaced by
bilateral deals prioritising economic and military transactions that
appeal to domestic audiences.

This transactional approach has heightened apprehension among American
partners. Once-sacrosanct agreements are now conditional, eroding trust
in US commitments.

[This shift poses both **risks and opportunities for Southeast Asia.**
Vietnam and Cambodia, for example, face steep tariffs due to large trade
deficits and their perceived alignment with China. While Vietnam has
sought closer security cooperation with the US, its deep economic and
political ties with Beijing complicate matters. Cambodia, meanwhile, is
seen in Washington as firmly within China's sphere of
influence.]{.underline}

Both nations are attempting to address US concerns, openly expressing a
desire for dialogue on Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs. Simultaneously,
they are diversifying their trade relationships to minimise dependence
on the US in an increasingly volatile world.

The Trump administration's erratic messaging has not helped. Recent
proposals, such as a travel ban targeting Southeast Asian countries,
signal a pressure campaign aimed at distancing regional partners from
Beijing. Yet this approach leaves governments confused and cautious.

Asean, with its consensus-based decision-making and multilateral
structure, is unlikely to appeal to a US administration that prefers
direct, one-on-one negotiations. Consequently, Asean risks being
sidelined as Washington pursues bilateral agreements that promise
faster, headline-grabbing outcomes.

[While multilateral commitments may be off the table, Southeast Asian
nations could use bilateral deals to defuse tensions and secure
short-term economic stability. Tailored trade agreements or symbolic
security gestures that appear favourable to US interests could preserve
working relationships without compromising broader regional
strategies.]{.underline}

[**This strategic uncertainty also creates an opening for other regional
powers.** China and Japan, with their strong institutional ties,
economic capacity and commitment to multilateralism, are well-positioned
to fill some of the void left by the US.]{.underline}

[By investing in regional institutions and presenting themselves as
consistent, credible partners, Beijing and Tokyo can enhance their soft
power and solidify their leadership roles in Southeast
Asia.]{.underline}

Ultimately, Trump's foreign policy reflects a deeper identity crisis
within the US. For decades, Americans viewed global leadership as a
privilege. Under Trump, it is increasingly framed as a burden.

This change raises fundamental questions about the future of US
engagement in the world. As America steps back, the global stage is left
without a clear stabiliser.

The rules-based order that once governed international affairs is giving
way to a system where power plays and opportunism reign. With no nation
capable of supplanting the role the US once played, the world is
entering an era of uncertainty -- one where might makes right and
smaller nations have little say in shaping their destiny.

[**Whether this shift can be reversed seems unlikely.** What is certain,
however, is that the world ahead will be more unpredictable,
transactional and dangerous than the one that came before
it.]{.underline}

## Transition

### Transition\-\--Bipolarity\-\--2NC

#### The world is settling into [peaceful]{.underline} US-China [bipolarity]{.underline}\-\--overcorrecting to US hegemony is [conflict driving]{.underline} and [alienates]{.underline} non-aligned countries. 

**Patton and Lemahieu 24** \[Susannah Patton is Director of the
Southeast Asia Program at the Lowy Institute and the Project Lead for
the Asia Power Index, the Institute's annual data-driven assessment that
maps the changing distribution of power in the region. Hervé Lemahieu is
the Lowy Institute's Director of Research. "Asia Has No Hegemon But
U.S.-Chinese Bipolarity Is Good for America and the Region."
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/asia-has-no-hegemon\] //aka

Debates about the balance of power in Asia typically rely on one of
three views. Some analysts believe, fatalistically, that China has
become an unassailably dominant force in the region. Others place
continued faith in U.S. primacy and see China as weak, vulnerable, and
ultimately containable. Still others, including U.S. allies such as
Australia and Japan, tout the emergence of a multipolar Indo-Pacific
that could arrest China's ambitions for regional hegemony.

[An accurate understanding of the balance of power in Asia is critical
to the formulation of sound U.S. strategy on China. But none of these
prevailing narratives get things quite right. Asia today is **uniquely
bipolar,** dominated by the world's only two superpowers.]{.underline}
Asia is not a European-style concert of powers, a Middle Eastern
free-for-all, or a Cold War--era system of opposing blocs. [Countries in
Asia are for the most part hedging between two giants. The even balance
between the United States and China also makes Asia's power politics
**the most stable** among the major regional theaters.]{.underline}

[To construct a more comprehensive and accurate view of the distribution
of power in Asia, the Lowy Institute created the Asia Power Index, which
goes beyond the traditional shorthand measure of economic size to look
at military capability, national resilience, and the expected future
distribution of demographic and economic resources, as well as four
dimensions of regional influence: economic relationships, cultural
influence, defense networks and diplomacy. What it reveals is a
**durable duopoly**: the United States has **lost primacy in Asia** but
remains around ten percent more powerful there than China.]{.underline}
Scholars have posited that a power transition is triggered when a rising
power's overall strength approaches 80 percent of that of the
established power. By 2018, China had already convincingly breached this
threshold. But the dynamic is not that of a rising power eclipsing an
established one; [it is a dynamic of two powers that will likely
continue to coexist as peer competitors applying different means of
influence: the United States mainly uses security partnerships; China
mainly uses economic relationships.]{.underline}

[In Europe, by contrast, a **cohesive multipolarity** prevents any
single country from posing a hegemonic threat.]{.underline} Russia may
hope that the United States' support for Ukraine will falter, but it
does not have the resources to launch a direct conflict with a much
larger bloc of EU and NATO countries aligned against it. The Middle
East, meanwhile, is defined by messy multipolarity. A handful of
players---China, Iran, Israel, Russia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and the
United Arab Emirates---are jostling for advantage as the United States
continues to retreat from the region, but no regional power reigns
supreme.

[Bipolarity stabilizes Asia for the moment and enables the United States
to protect its vital regional interests, preventing a potential hegemon
from disrupting the peace, and safeguarding the economic benefits that
Washington derives from trade and investment with the region. But to
ensure that this suitable status quo prevails, **the United States must
contend with the strengths and limitations of its power,** rather than
overestimate the advantages of its regional alliance partnerships, and
strengthen its appeal to nonaligned countries, which are still the
majority in Asia.]{.underline}

THE MIRAGE OF MULTIPOLARITY

[**Asia's bipolarity has endured** even as many have hoped that India
and Japan could become pillars in a truly multipolar
region.]{.underline} But according to the index, each of those countries
has less than a third of China's economic capability, a measure that
accounts for the size of their economies, as well as their technological
sophistication. India and China have the two largest militaries in the
world by number of personnel. Yet India's ability to project power and
influence east of the Strait of Malacca is limited. Neither its military
nor Japan's comes close to matching the capability of China's People's
Liberation Army or the pace of its recent naval buildup. New Delhi and
Tokyo can compete with Beijing in terms of cultural and diplomatic
influence in Asia. But when it comes to economic relationships---trade,
investment, and development financing---Japan has just 40 percent of
China's regional influence, down from 60 percent in 2018, and India a
mere 15 percent.

Over the last decade, governments around the world have embraced the
idea that Asia should really be understood as a two-ocean super-region,
"the Indo-Pacific," conjuring hopes that India as well as Australia and
Japan could play decisive roles in preventing China from establishing a
post-American order. But no major powers in the region are able to match
China in the absence of the United States as a security guarantor.
Without the United States as a balancing force, East Asia would be
utterly dominated by China.

The surprising weakness of U.S. partners is disconcerting for
Washington. It undermines the narrative that the United States is
upgrading the alliance network it built in the Pacific after World War
II---a multipolar makeover that the Biden administration has stressed as
its primary achievement in Asia. As U.S. National Security Adviser Jake
Sullivan put it in 2021, a new "latticework of alliances and
partnerships" is enabling U.S. regional allies---Australia, Japan, the
Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand---and other partners such as
India to contribute more to the region's security and to push back
against China.

It is true that, with the exception of Thailand, Washington's Asian
allies are more closely aligned with the United States than at any other
time since the end of the Cold War. But this must be assessed in the
context of deepening bipolarity---a system in which only the United
States has the power to challenge China.

Combined military exercises and defense dialogues between the United
States and its Asian allies have dramatically intensified since 2021.
This strengthening of ties is particularly pronounced in the
U.S.-Japanese alliance, which has shifted from focusing purely on the
defense of Japan to cooperation on regional and global security issues.
And Washington, Tokyo, and Seoul have renewed and institutionalized
their trilateral ties.

Australia, meanwhile, is deepening its relationship with the United
States by acquiring nuclear-powered submarines through the AUKUS
trilateral security partnership the two countries have with the United
Kingdom. The Philippines is stoutly defending its maritime interests in
the South China Sea and, in 2024, participated for the first time in
combined military exercises with Australia, Japan, and the United
States, a grouping that American officials have dubbed "the Squad."
Manila has also given the United States new access to additional
military bases, including at sites close to Taiwan.

These achievements offer some advantages to the United States: prestige
in the peacetime competition for influence, improved military access and
basing in the region, and a minor augmentation to the United States'
capabilities in the event of a conflict with China. They also send a
message to Beijing that an outright conflict, especially over Taiwan,
could lead to a broader allied response. Indeed, Chinese leader Xi
Jinping has seized on the Biden administration's rhetoric about the
collective strength of U.S. partners to draw an explicit parallel
between the expansion of NATO in Europe and the United States'
alliance-building efforts in Asia.

[Yet both Beijing and Washington overestimate the real changes to the
United States' alliance network in Asia.]{.underline} The comparatively
small footprint of its alliances---comprising just five countries---has
not grown in decades. Upgrading alliances alone cannot deliver a
decisive additional advantage to the United States in its competition
with China. In the event of a conflict or military contingency with
China, U.S. allies would come under heavy pressure from Beijing to limit
the United States' access, basing, and overflight rights.

**[Bipolarity stabilizes Asia and enables the United States to protect
its vital regional interests.]{.underline}**

And the overall size of these U.S. allies' military forces remains
small. When it comes to firepower, as measured by the number of missile
launch cells on board ships and submarines, Australia, Japan, and South
Korea combined have less than a quarter of the United States'
capability. Together, the defense budgets of U.S. allies in Asia are
less than a fifth of that of the United States. Well-known deficiencies
in the United States' readiness for a conflict, such as its inadequate
munitions inventories, cannot be quickly remedied through allied
cooperation. For instance, Japan's highly publicized decision in July to
sell Patriot missiles to the United States has already been thrown into
doubt owing to a shortage of a critical component that only the United
States produces.

It is telling that almost every form of renewed security cooperation in
recent years has been first sought by a U.S. ally rather than by the
United States. The creation of AUKUS, Japan's partnership with the
United States to enlarge its military capacity, and Manila's renewed
cooperation with Washington were all efforts to bind the United States
at a time when it has become far more discerning about how it deploys
its global power.

And Washington's actions---if not its rhetoric---show that it
understands that Asia is not, in fact, meaningfully multipolar. The
United States still resists fully sharing its defense technologies and
strategic and operational plans with Asian partners, which can be read
as an implicit recognition that these allies are unlikely to make a
decisive difference in a conflict with China. Washington remains central
in every meaningful security grouping in Asia. Most fundamentally, all
of the United States' alliances in Asia continue to be anchored by
bilateral security guarantees, in contrast to the collective defense
commitment that applies to NATO allies equally.

THE BENEFITS OF BIPOLARITY

[This might all sound like bad news for Washington. **Yet in many ways,
Asia's bipolarity is good for the region---and good for the United
States.**]{.underline} For one thing, the fundamentals of U.S. power in
the region remain strong. Overall, the United States' enduring military
advantages outweigh its weaknesses, at least for now, especially in
undersea warfare and long-range strike capability. Its capacity to put
China's military assets at risk from afar was demonstrated earlier this
year, when a U.S. B-2 bomber fired a low-cost munition and sank a
decommissioned Chinese vessel. This type of long-range strike capability
is much harder for China to counter than the incremental improvements to
the U.S. military posture in Japan and the Philippines.

And even with China's rapid advances in some technologies, such as
electric vehicles, the United States remains a larger global hub of
innovation. The United States possesses the world's preferred currency,
enjoys abundant energy resources, and has favorable demographic trends,
whereas China struggles on all three of those fronts. Most debilitating
to China, its economy faces long-term headwinds caused by a contracting
and aging workforce.

[The stability brought about by bipolarity in Asia, which has benefited
the United States as much as any other country, is **underappreciated**.
Asia has no shortage of flash points, notably over Taiwan and the South
China Sea. What is surprising, however, is not that these flash
points---and episodic gray-zone clashes---exist but that they have not
turned into **more deadly conflicts.**]{.underline} Contrast this
relative peace with Europe, where Russia's war of aggression on Ukraine
continues. Moscow, no longer able to wield a veto over Europe's security
architecture, has become its arsonist. In the Middle East, the war in
Gaza threatens to escalate into a wider regional conflict as a multitude
of players struggle to gain the upper hand.

Countries in Asia should not be complacent about the risk of increased
conflict. But they should also recognize that [things could be much
worse for them]{.underline}. Even from China's point of view, Asia would
be more dangerous and chaotic without the influence of the United
States. If the United States were to retreat from Asia, Beijing would
still have no clear route to establishing a stable China-centric order.
It has territorial or maritime disputes with at least ten other
countries in the region. And without the United States' security
umbrella, South Korea---and possibly even Australia or Japan---might
seek to develop its own nuclear weapons. The prospect of a nuclear arms
race underscores the ultimate value of the Biden administration's effort
to shore up alliances in Asia. By giving allies greater confidence in
U.S. commitments and the endurance of a bipolar balance of power, the
United States can help prevent them from seeking dangerous alternative
pathway to security.

Washington should continue to invest in alliances as part of a strategy
to deter China.

[The existence of two poles also gives most Asian countries the
opportunity to swim between them and avoid having to align with just
one.]{.underline} U.S. diplomacy "is not about forcing countries to
choose," U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in articulating
this proposition in 2022. "It's about giving them a choice." The
existence of this choice matters because nonaligned countries are the
majority and the center of Asian regional institutions such as the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the East Asia Summit. Some of
these countries---Singapore, for example---use the space that bipolarity
affords them to hedge against the risk of overdependence on any one
partner. Others, such as Vietnam, have even profited more directly from
U.S.-Chinese competition by positioning themselves as "connector
economies," or intermediaries between the two superpowers, which no
longer wish to maintain strong direct economic ties.

It is among countries outside the alliance system, however, that
Washington also faces the greatest danger to its standing in Asia. The
United States does not need the nonaligned countries to choose it---they
never will. But there are worrying signs that these countries are
gradually drifting toward China and abandoning active hedging. For
example, many countries in Southeast Asia are shrugging their shoulders
at China's bullying and coercion of the Philippines. In a high-profile
move, Malaysia recently recognized Beijing's position on reunifying
Taiwan. Indonesia, for its part, sees Beijing as by far its most
important partner supporting its economic development. China is on track
to secure permanent access to a military base in Cambodia in a secretive
deal. Even as its allies rally behind the United States, a view has
hardened among the region's hedgers that it is a distant and unreliable
power.

[The United States no longer enjoys primacy in Asia. But an effort to
restore this primacy would be seen by many Asian countries as
**disastrously revisionist.**]{.underline} Instead, the United States
should develop a strategy that focuses on shoring up its own position as
a status quo power, one of two poles in Asia. This means doing more to
reestablish its military edge in Asia by prioritizing the deployment of
submarines, fighter aircraft, and warships to the region. Washington
should continue to invest in alliances as part of a strategy to deter
China but avoid overestimating the importance of these alliances to the
overall balance of power in Asia. And to redress the shift away from the
United States by the region's nonaligned countries, it should engage
more with them diplomatically and economically. [Doing so will not
restore U.S. primacy but can help ensure that bipolarity---**the least
bad option for America and the region**---endures.]{.underline}

Jennifer Lind in her work "Back to Bipolarity: How China's Rise
Transformed the Balance of Power" published in International Security
(Fall 2024) argues, that **[the global order is now bipolar, dominated
by the U.S. and China.]{.underline}** The author introduces a method to
measure national power using historical data (1820--1990). This method
shows that [China has surpassed key thresholds]{.underline}, making it a
superpower capable of challenging the U.S.

Lind highlights that great powers have often competed with the leading
state despite economic disadvantages. For example, the Soviet Union
maintained intense competition with the U.S. even with only 44% of its
GDP. Similarly, [China does not need to match the U.S. economically to
compete militarily and politically.]{.underline}

[**The study concludes that the world is now bipolar.** China meets or
exceeds historical great power standards, surpassing the Soviet Union at
its peak. Its military strength and economic influence place it
alongside the U.S. as the dominant global power.]{.underline}

[India and Russia hold significant regional influence but do not qualify
as great powers.]{.underline} They fall short on military spending and
strategic reach. [Japan and Germany have strong economies but lack the
military power to compete globally.]{.underline} India's growing
economic power gives it influence, but it remains a regional player
rather than a global one.

[The shift to bipolarity has reshaped U.S. foreign policy. The
U.S.-China rivalry will define global politics, forcing the U.S. to
rethink its alliances and security strategies.The article argues that
China's rise has ended unipolarity, creating a bipolar world dominated
by the U.S. and China.]{.underline}

[This challenges Trump's 'America First' policy, which aims to restore
U.S.-led unipolarity through economic protectionism and military
dominance. While Trump's approach seeks to reassert American primacy,
China's growing capabilities challenge this unipolarity, and the balance
of power remains fundamentally bipolar, **making a return to unipolarity
unlikely**]{.underline}

Key Takeaways

[The Chinese grand strategy framework is designed to undermine American
hegemony in the existing "rules-based" international order, while not
yet seeking to establish its own.]{.underline}

China's strategic objectives stem less from ideological or
internally-driven considerations and are primarily driven by physical,
geopolitical, and material factors, including the question of resources
and capabilities.

[China's power still lags behind that of the United States: Beijing is
currently unable to match, let alone supplant, the U.S. dominance
globally. This imbalance will likely persist for the foreseeable
future.]{.underline}

[A regional analysis of China's strategy shows Beijing's preference for
ideologically-neutral policies designed to disrupt American dominance,
rather than overturn it.]{.underline}

Historical analogies that emphasize head-on conflict between China and
the United States ("Cold War 2.0") are inapt and likely to lead to an
over-aggressive U.S. strategy.

The United States ought to utilize a mixed strategy of restrained
"balancing" and "blunting" -- rather than full-spectrum "containment" --
to manage its geopolitical relationship with China without overextending
and overcommitting itself.

The Core Drivers of China's Grand Strategy

For decades, China's rise has been a subject of intense debate and
speculation, particularly regarding its intentions on the global stage.
[Some observers argue that China is on a path to dominate the world,
seeking to replace the United States as the global hegemon.]{.underline}
However, a closer examination of China's actions, strategies, and
diplomatic postures reveals a more nuanced picture: China is not
primarily seeking global domination. [Instead, it is focused on
undermining American hegemony and promoting a multi-nodal world order
within the existing "rules-based" paradigm, where power is distributed
among several global powers.]{.underline} By understanding China's true
intentions, we can better grasp the evolving dynamics of international
relations and formulate more effective strategic responses from the
United States.

Ultimately, China's grand strategy can be understood through a sober
analysis of its actions and capabilities across multiple regions and
domains. First, the PRC does not yet have the capability to overthrow
American hegemony through head-on competition. [Second, China's actions
are geared toward diluting U.S. dominance and fostering a more balanced
global order.]{.underline} [This strategy includes fostering
multi-alignment --- a diplomatic approach that encourages countries to
maintain cooperative relations with multiple major powers rather than
aligning strictly with one. This multi-alignment strategy is evident in
key regions such as the Middle East, East Asia, and Europe, as well as
in global governance institutions like the United Nations.]{.underline}

[China seeks to shape a global order that reflects its priorities and
values without triggering either direct or by-proxy confrontation with
the United States.]{.underline} This approach enables China to expand
its influence while avoiding the risks associated with outright
hegemonic ambitions.

At the core of this strategy lies China's desire to create a
geopolitical environment that is more conducive to its rise and
interests.

Global Governance: Realigning International Norms and Institutions

[As alluded to above, China's challenge to U.S. global hegemony extends
beyond regional strategies and is particularly evident in its approach
to global governance. Beijing has become increasingly assertive in
international organizations such as the United Nations, the World Trade
Organization (WTO), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), where it
seeks to reshape global norms and standards in alignment with its
interests. This includes advocating for de-dollarization and reinforcing
the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign
states.]{.underline}

[China's growing influence within these institutions is part of a
broader effort to create an international environment less susceptible
to unilateral U.S. action and more conducive to a polycentric world
order.]{.underline} This strategy capitalizes on widespread resentment
among peripheral states toward the U.S.-led postwar international order.
However, this should not be mistaken for a diplomatic crusade to promote
a universally applicable, and ideologically inflected, Chinese model.
[Rather, China's approach is pragmatic and ideologically neutral,
appealing primarily to states dissatisfied with Washington's
universalist, if self-righteous, prescriptions for governance --- based
on its parochial neoliberal or "democratist" models. In any case, the
PRC has repeatedly demonstrated its transactional approach, willing to
collaborate with all types of regimes, including democratic and
capitalist ones, when strategic interests align.]{.underline}

//aka

Since US President Donald [Trump]{.underline} took office this year, one
theme has come up time and again: his [rule is a threat to the US-led
international order.]{.underline}

As the US political scientist John Mearsheimer famously argued, [the
liberal international order was **destined to fail from the start**, as
it contained the seeds of its own destruction.]{.underline}

This perspective has gained traction in recent years. And now, Trump's
actions have caused many to question whether a new world order is
emerging.

[Trump has expressed a desire for a new international order defined by
**multiple spheres of influence** --- one in which powers like the US,
China and Russia each exert dominance over distinct
regions.]{.underline}

[**This vision aligns with the idea of a "multipolar" world**, where no
single state holds overarching global dominance. Instead, **influence is
distributed among several great powers**, each maintaining its own
regional sphere.]{.underline}

This architecture contrasts sharply with earlier periods -- the bipolar
world of the Cold War, dominated by the US and the Soviet Union; and the
unipolar period that followed, dominated by the US.

What does this mean for the world order moving forward?

Shifting US spheres of influence

[**We've seen this shift taking place** in recent months. For example,
Trump has backed away from his pledge to end the war between Russia and
Ukraine and now appears to be leaving it to the main protagonists, and
Europe, to find a solution.]{.underline}

[Europe, which once largely spoke in a unified voice with the US, is
also showing signs of policy-making which is more
independent.]{.underline} Rather than framing its actions as protecting
"Western democratic principles", [Europe is increasingly focused on
defining its own security interests.]{.underline}

In the Middle East, the US will likely maintain its sphere of influence.
It will continue its unequivocal support for Israel under Trump.

House.

Amid shifting global alliances, the Trump administration will continue
to support Israel, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

The US will also involve itself in the region's politics when its
interests are at stake, as we witnessed in its recent strikes on Iranian
nuclear facilities.

This, along with increasing economic ties between the US and Gulf
states, suggests US allies in the region will remain the dominant voices
shaping regional dynamics, particularly now with Iran weakened.

[Yet it's clear Trump is reshaping US dynamics in the region by
signaling a desire for **reduced military and political involvement**,
and criticising the nation building efforts of previous
administrations.]{.underline}

The Trump administration now appears to want to maintain its sphere of
influence primarily through strong economic ties.

**[Russia and China poles emerging elsewhere]{.underline}**

[Meanwhile, other poles are emerging in the Global South. Russia and
China have deepened their cooperation, positioning themselves as
defenders against what they frame as **Western hegemonic
bullying.**]{.underline}

[Trump's trade policies and sanctions against many nations in the Global
South have **fuelled narratives**]{.underline} (spread by China and
Russia) [that the US does not consistently adhere to the
rules]{.underline} it imposes on others.

[Trump's decision to slash funding to USAID has also **opened the door
to China**, in particular, to become the main development partner for
nations in Africa and other parts of the world.]{.underline}

And on the security front, [Russia has become more involved]{.underline}
in many African and Middle Eastern countries, which have become less
trustful and reliant on Western powers.

In the Indo-Pacific, much attention has been given to the rise of China
and its increasingly assertive posture. [Many of Washington's
traditional allies are nervous]{.underline} about its continued
engagement in the region and ability to counter China's rise.

Chinese leader Xi Jinping has sought to take advantage of the current
environment, embarking on a Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia push earlier
this year. But many nations continue to be wary of China's increasing
influence, in particular the Philippines, which has clashed with China
over the South China Sea.

Strategic hedging

Not all countries, however, are aligning themselves neatly with one pole
or another.

For small states caught between great powers, navigating this multipolar
environment is both a risk and an opportunity.

Ukraine is a case in point. As a sovereign state, Ukraine should have
the freedom to decide its own alignments. Yet, it finds itself ensnared
in great power politics, with devastating consequences.

[Other small states are playing a different game --- pivoting from one
power to another based on their immediate interests.]{.underline}

Slovakia, for instance, is both a NATO and EU member, yet its leader,
Robert Fico, attended Russia's Victory Day Parade in May and told
President Vladimir Putin he wanted to maintain "normal relations" with
Russia.

Then there is Central Asia, which is the centre of a renewed "great
game," with Russia, China and Europe vying for influence and economic
partnerships.

Yet if any Central Asian countries were to be invaded by Putin, would
other powers intervene? It's a difficult question to answer. Major
powers are reluctant to engage in direct conflict unless their core
interests or borders are directly threatened.

[As a result, Central Asian states are **hedging their bets**, seeking
to maintain relations with multiple poles, despite their conflicting
agendas.]{.underline}

A future defined by regional power blocs?

While it is still early to draw definitive conclusions, the events of
the past few months underscore a growing trend. Smaller countries are
expressing solidarity with one power, but pragmatic cooperation with
another, when it suits their national interests.

**[For this reason, regional power blocs seem to be of increasing
interest to countries in the Global South.]{.underline}**

For instance, [the China-led Shanghai Cooperation Organisation has
become a **stronger and larger** grouping of nations across Eurasia in
recent years.]{.underline}

[Trump's focus on making "America Great Again," has **taken the load off
the US** carrying liberal order leadership. **A multipolar world may not
be the end of the liberal international order, but it may be a reshaped
version of liberal governance.**]{.underline}

How "liberal" it can be will likely depend on what each regional power,
or pole, will make of it.

For decades, US allies have slept soundly under the protection of
America's overwhelming military might. [Donald Trump --- with his
threats to ditch NATO, seize Greenland, and abandon Taiwan --- seems
hell-bent on shattering that comfort]{.underline}. But according to Hugh
White --- one of the world's leading strategic thinkers, emeritus
professor at the Australian National University, and author of Hard New
World: Our Post American Future --- [Trump isn't destroying American
hegemony. He's simply revealing that it's already gone. "Trump has very
little trouble accepting other great powers as co-equals," Hugh
explains. And that happens to align perfectly with a strategic reality
the foreign policy establishment desperately wants to ignore:
fundamental shifts in global power have made the costs of maintaining a
US-led hegemony prohibitively high]{.underline}. Even under Biden, when
Russia invaded Ukraine, the US sent weapons but explicitly ruled out
direct involvement. [Ukraine matters far more to Russia than America,
and this "asymmetry of resolve" makes Putin's nuclear threats credible
where America's counterthreats simply aren't. Hugh's gloomy
prediction]{.underline}: "Europeans will end up conceding to Russia
whatever they can't convince the Russians they're willing to fight a
nuclear war to deny them."

The Pacific tells the same story. Despite Obama's "pivot to Asia" and
Biden's tough talk about "winning the competition for the 21st century,"
actual US military capabilities there have barely budged while [China's
have soared, along with its economy --- which is now bigger than the
US's, as measured in purchasing power. Containing China and defending
Taiwan would require America to spend 8% of GDP on defence]{.underline}
(versus 3.5% today) --- and convince Beijing it's willing to accept Los
Angeles being vaporised. Unlike during the Cold War, no president ---
Trump or otherwise --- can make that case to voters. So what's next?
[Hugh's prognoses are stark: Taiwan is in an impossible situation and
we're doing them a disservice pretending otherwise. South Korea, Japan,
and one of the EU or Poland will have to go nuclear to defend
themselves. Trump might actually follow through and annex Panama and
Greenland --- but probably not Canada]{.underline}.

[Australia can defend itself from China but needs an entirely different
military to do it. Our new "multipolar" future, split between American,
Chinese, Russian, Indian, and European spheres of influence, is a
"darker world" than the golden age of US dominance]{.underline}. But
Hugh's message is blunt: [for better or worse, 35 years of American
hegemony are over. The challenge now is managing the transition
peacefully, and creating a stable multipolar order more like Europe's
relatively peaceful 19th century than the chaotic bloodbath Europe
suffered in the 17th --- which, if replicated today, would be a nuclear
bloodbath]{.underline}. In today's conversation, Hugh and Rob explore
why even AI supremacy might not restore US dominance (spoiler: China
still has nukes), why Japan can defend itself but Taiwan can't, and why
a new president won't be able to reverse the big picture.

The world faces [unprecedented social and environmental challenges that

Western notions of what it is to be human, yet those very notions will
probably dictate the spirit and strength of how the challenges are

human values and suggests that they are in a paradoxical state of
tension]{.underline}.

The world is [experiencing significant environmental challenges brought
about by the humans who inhabit it, including climate change,

these issues requires collective action. However, such action is
[hampered by a Western hegemony around the very notion of what it is to
be human]{.underline}.

To a large degree, [the West, helped in no small part by its historic
economic and political dominance, has shaped ideals of human values and
expected the rest of the world to get on board]{.underline}. A leading
Austrian philosopher, Dr Michael Zichy, says such ideals, including
Western notions of capitalism, exist in a paradoxical state of constant
tension, contribute to the current environmental and social challenges,
and are at odds with human values elsewhere in the world. They are thus,
at best, incomplete. If humans hope to address these challenges
collectively, they must first agree on what it is to be human.

Zichy aims to tackle this conundrum. Professor of Philosophy at the
University of Bonn, Germany, Zichy is an expert in ethics and
philosophical anthropology, in particular the theory of different
understandings of the human being. [The concept may seem self-evident --
humans can easily identify other humans -- but the idea of the human
'being' is fraught with debate and deep introspection. It is also highly
political and can steer policies that are arguably 'inhumane' but
seemingly popular. For Zichy, a Western hegemony exists around what it
is to be a human being, and its imperiousness is impeding a global
response to the challenges we are all facing. There's no quick fix; this
hegemony is deeply embedded -- its roots go back hundreds of
years]{.underline}.

[hegemonic systems often mask the self-interest of the dominant state,
using consent to obscure coercion. For instance, while the U.S.-led
order promoted free trade and democracy, it also advanced American
strategic priorities, sometimes at the expense of weaker states. And
hegemony is difficult to maintain in the long run. Those that rely too
heavily on coercion risk losing legitimacy, but excessive reliance on
consent without the backing of power can undermine the hegemon's ability
to enforce rules and protect core interests]{.underline}. In today's
multipolar world, the concept of hegemony faces new challenges.

[The rise of China, along with regional powers such as Turkey, Indonesia
and Saudi Arabia, has disrupted the unipolar dominance of the U.S. These
would-be regional hegemons bring with them their own means of imposing
influence through economic incentives and coercion]{.underline}. In
China's case, infrastructure and trade development through the Belt and
Road Initiative is counterbalanced with shows of military strength in
the South China Sea. As the global order becomes increasingly
fragmented, the future of global hegemony is uncertain.

[While no single power currently has the capacity to dominate the
international system, the need for leadership remains critical. Many
observers would argue that issues such as climate change, technological
regulation and pandemic responses require coordination that only a
hegemonic or collective leadership framework can provide]{.underline}.
Whether hegemony evolves into a more shared model of leadership or gives
way to a more anarchic system could shape the trajectory of
international relations in the 21st century.

Executive Summary

Debate over questions of polarity --- that is to say, [whether the world
is entering a period of multipolarity, unipolarity, or bipolarity ---
have become **increasingly** intense among both international relations
scholars and **policymakers**]{.underline}. The United States' winning
record during the Cold War has led many to assume that a new bipolar
[competition with China is **emerging** and offers the best opportunity
for **success**]{.underline}. These assumptions, however, are
questionable. The authors of this paper test two key assumptions
surrounding this debate. First, the paper evaluates what kind of
international system is emerging: multipolar, bipolar, or unipolar.
Second, the paper explores the potential each of these systems carries
for increased risk of conflict between major powers compared with a
bipolar international system.

Assessing these two assumptions explicitly is important because the
second assumption is too often addressed implicitly in discussions of
the first, with [**policymakers** in particular **tending** to favor the
system they believe will be **best** for the United States. Looking at a
**variety** of data sources --- which **capture** not just China's
growth, but also the major **economic** gains made by middle powers in
recent years --- the authors **conclude** that the emerging distribution
of power is best described as a system of "**unbalanced**
multipolarity]{.underline}." Power is increasingly diffusing away from
the superpowers toward a variety of capable, dynamic middle powers that
will help to [shape the **international** environment in coming decades.
The **question** of U.S. policy is more **complicated**]{.underline}:
Though academic literature indicates that indeed [more wars occur during
**periods** of **multipolarity**]{.underline}, the evidence suggests
that these are more likely to be [civil **wars** and low-scale conflicts
rather than great **power** wars]{.underline}. From the point of view of
U.S. [national interests, a lower risk of **great**-power war ---
particularly in the **nuclear** era --- may be preferable to the
**alternatives**]{.underline}.

The paper concludes by examining current U.S. strategy in the context of
an emerging multipolar order and argues that the Biden administration's
approach is heavily dependent on potentially inaccurate assumptions
about bipolarity, as well as the ability of the [United **States** to
re-run the **Cold** War playbook. Attempts by the **United** States to
build large coalitions in opposition to **China** are unlikely to be
successful in a more **multipolar** system, and the risk of **direct**
conflict may be higher if the United States engages in a **Biden**-style
"bloc-building" **strategy**]{.underline}.

Weaknesses of America: A Preliminary Review

[We can speak about several [potential **weaknesses**]{.mark} of the
U.S., though [some]{.mark} of them are currently **[supporting]{.mark}**
its power. [Sooner or later]{.mark}, though, these [weaknesses]{.mark}
will **[cause]{.mark}** a **[crisis]{.mark}** that will make it more
difficult for the **[US]{.mark}** to **[maintain]{.mark}** its
**[influence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We suggest a preliminary list of
[seven weaknesses]{.underline}:

1\. [[**Large** and persistent **foreign** trade **deficit**]{.mark}
(and, in general, the deficit in balance of payments accounts) that has
an upward trend]{.underline}.

2\. [[**Large** and **chronic** fiscal **deficit**]{.mark}, which is
also [increasing]{.mark}. It seems impossible to drastically reduce, and
even less probable to eliminate it]{.underline}.

3\. [**[Huge]{.mark}** and [**constantly** increasing **national
debt**]{.mark}; the overall debt burden of business and
population]{.underline}.

4\. [[High **dependence**]{.mark} of the [American **economy**]{.mark}
and [foreign **policy**]{.mark} on a [peculiar role]{.mark} for the
[dollar]{.mark}]{.underline}. The declining dollar and falling
confidence in it can lead to an enormous and systemic crisis in the USA.

5\. [[**Peculiarities** of the **healthcare system**]{.mark}. Extremely
[high prices]{.mark} for [healthcare services]{.mark} and [drugs]{.mark}
undermine the budget and may become a [growth driver]{.mark} of the
[national debt]{.mark}]{.underline} (especially given the country's
ageing population).

6\. Growth of demographic disproportions. [Along with other
**[social]{.mark}** and [**demographic** trends]{.mark}, this can
[weaken **national unity**]{.mark} and **[escalate civil
conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

7\. [The **[weakness]{.mark}** of the [American **political**
system]{.mark} in the [context]{.mark} of **[globalization]{.mark}** and
the need to maintain **[leadership]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The U.S.
political system is currently ill-suited to solve global foreign policy
issues related to maintenance of the American hegemony.

In contrast to the two preceding Restraint approaches, [another approach
is to significantly **reduce**, if not end, forward **deployed U.S.
forces** all along the Asian littoral]{.underline}. This perspective can
be viewed as an essential part of a [transition to an "**offshore
balancing**" role in which the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [has **no formal security obligations** to any
Asian nation but provides assistance selectively and remains capable of
deploying into the region **if necessary**, to prevent or resolve
**conflict**]{.underline}.64 [This posture would]{.underline} arguably:
(a) give the United States a free hand to act only when its interests
are truly imperiled, (b) [incentivize much stronger levels of **local
counterbalancing**]{.underline} (with U.S. assistance),
[and]{.underline} (c) [limit the intensity of **Sino--U.S.
competition**]{.underline} to the extent possible, [to preserve the
possibility of **ad hoc cooperation** on issues of common
interest]{.underline} (e.g., environment and trade). [In such an effort,
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[would probably need to accept **some loss of influence** over
traditional partners such as Japan, but would also work to craft
**diplomatic--military understandings** with Beijing, Japan, and others
in order to reduce **friction** and the **potential for

[The]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [is
**no longer capable** of enforcing stability across most of the globe
through the exercise of **dominant** economic and military **power** and
political/ideological **values**. The world has become a far **more
complex**, interdependent, **multipolar** place, with virtually all
nations holding a large array of cross--cutting interests]{.underline}
regarding trade, finance, technology, and social and political values.
[This makes it **virtually impossible** to create coherent,
clearly--defined, and **sustainable**, U.S. (or Chinese)--**led blocs**
of nations committed to **countering other blocs** of nations in largely
**zero--sum ways**. The common desire of most states is and will remain
to **hedge**]{.underline} and equivocate [in supporting or opposing any
U.S. or Chinese zero--sum goals across the board. It is **very
unlikely** that either Beijing or **Washington** will possess the
capability to overcome this **structural feature** of the
**21st--century environment**]{.underline}, absent a paradigm--shifting
war between them that forces nations to choose sides, a conflict that
neither desires nor is certain of winning.

Equally important, [a deepening level of **Sino--U.S. strategic
rivalry** marked by **zero--sum**, worst--case assumptions and policies
will not only **increase** the chance of **conflict**, but also severely
**undermine** the ability of all nations to **cooperate** in combating
the primary challenge of **climate change**, as well as the high
possibility of future **pandemics**, global **financial disarray**, and
**WMD proliferation**. These challenges cannot be treated as lesser
included concerns subordinate to a so--called "**great power

handling them exceed those presented by such a competition, and a
**worsening Sino--U.S. rivalry** will **inevitably obstruct** meaningful
attempts to develop the technologies, trade and investment
relationships, and new **multinational** fora or structures necessary to

### Transition\-\--Offshore Balancing\-\--AT: Trump\-\--2NC

#### His strategy [is]{.underline} offshore balancing!

International Studies and vice chairman of the board for the Foreign
Policy Research Institute. February 14; "Is there a foreign policy
'Trump Doctrine'?" The Hill,
https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/5143116-is-there-a-foreign-policy-trump-doctrine/;
//ff\]

The furor that President [**Trump** provoked]{.underline} with his
proposal to relocate all of Gaza's residents has overshadowed [what
appears to be a **new** but **unstated American policy** --- a variant
of what has come to be called a strategy of "**offshore
balancing**."]{.underline}

This concept, as outlined by a group of international relations
theorists who style themselves "realists," [calls for the U.S. to
**remove itself** not only from becoming involved in **regional
conflicts**, but for the **most part withdrawing** its forces from bases
on foreign territory]{.underline}.

"Offshore balancing" has its [roots in a 19th-century British policy
that sought to maintain a balance of power in Europe while London
remained aloof from **commitments abroad**]{.underline}. Foreign
Secretary Lord Castlereagh was the first to implement the policy when he
successfully prevented the 1815 Congress of Vienna from imposing
punishing terms on France after its defeat in the Napoleonic Wars. Five
years later, he articulated London's non-intervention policy, which held
fast for almost a century thereafter.

[Trump has **made it clear** that in his **second term** he too would
prefer that the U.S. **not be tied down** in any region]{.underline} ---
although he has yet to withdraw any of America's overseas forces,
including those stationed in Germany. [He reportedly wants to **withdraw
20,000 troops** from Europe, representing about **one-fifth** of the
forces currently stationed there. He appears ready to demand that
Europeans subsidize the **80,000 troops** that would remain there, with
the implied threat that, absent such subsidies, most of them might
**also** be brought home]{.underline}.

Similarly, [Trump appears poised to withdraw the approximately **24,000
U.S. troops** stationed in **Korea**]{.underline}. He reportedly
considered withdrawing them during his first term, but both Secretary of
State Mike [Pompeo and]{.underline} Secretary of Defense Mark [Esper
convinced him to withhold any decision until his **second
term**]{.underline}. Both men are no longer in Trump's good books, and
[while the second term that they had in mind did not immediately
materialize, it is **now a reality**]{.underline}.

Nevertheless, [while Trump might consider withdrawing land forces from
overseas bases, American **naval and air forces** are likely to be a
different matter]{.underline}. Both in his first term and now at the
outset of his second, Trump has called upon both sets of forces to
conduct strikes against America's enemies.

In April 2017, [in response to the **Assad** regime's use of **chemical
weapons** against Syrian rebel forces, Trump authorized an **air
strike** against the regime's Sharyat Air Base, from which Washington
assessed government aircraft had carried out a chemical weapons strike a
few days earlier]{.underline}. The American attack consisted of 59
Tomahawk missiles that had been launched from two Arleigh Burke-class
destroyers.

Moreover, [Trump authorized **numerous air strikes** as part of the
coalition fighting the terrorist organization **ISIS**. The air strikes
incorporated attacks by fighters, bombers, helicopters and drones, and
they continued **throughout** Trump's first term]{.underline}.

In January 2020, [Trump ordered a **drone strike** killing Iranian
General]{.underline} Qassem **[Soleimani]{.underline}**, commander of
the Quds Force that managed Tehran's extraterritorial terrorist
operations. [The strike also killed **four members** of the
Iranian-backed **Iraqi militia** known as the Popular Mobilization
Forces, including one of its leaders]{.underline}, Abu Mahdi
al-Muhandis. The drone appears to have been launched from America's
al-Udeid air base in Qatar.

Finally, [at the beginning of this month, Trump ordered an air attack on
**ISIS** cave complexes in the semi-autonomous Puntland region of
**Somalia**]{.underline}. Fighters launched from the aircraft carrier
Harry S. Truman, operating in the Red Sea, launched the attacks. The
strikes marked the first major military operation of Trump's second
term, and [reprised his **earlier pattern** of relying on air strikes
against enemy targets]{.underline}.

[The president has not as yet articulated a "**Trump Doctrine**" in the
manner of many of his predecessors]{.underline}, beginning with Harry
Truman. [He may yet do so. But **in practice**, he is **already
implementing** one]{.underline}. Trump will not completely withdraw
America's overseas land presence, if only to maintain bases from which
air strikes can be launched and ships can be serviced. Instead, he will
rely primarily on land-based and naval air forces to pursue America's
military aims.

At the same time, **[Trump]{.underline}**, as he did in his first term,
[will continue to **press America's allies** to dedicate far more of
their budgets to **provide for their own** defenses. By doing so, he
would further **cement his vision** of a 21st-century America that would
**free itself** from **entangling** land-based wars and instead
operate]{.underline}, like 19th-century Britain, [as the world's great
"**offshore balancer**."]{.underline}

**[So]{.underline}**uth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea [in the north, through
**Southeast Asia**]{.underline}---the linchpin connecting the Indian and
Pacific Oceans---[to the **Indian subcontinent** in the south, a second
**Trump** administration does not arouse the same strong emotions that
it does among many in the West]{.underline}. For these countries, [there
is **far less concern** about Trump's **autocratic tendencies** and
contempt for liberal internationalist ideals. The region has **long
conducted relations** with Washington on the basis of **common
interests** rather than **common values**. Such an approach **fits
neatly** with Trump's **transactional**]{.underline}
**[fo]{.underline}**reign **[po]{.underline}**licy [because it involves
**balancing** mutual benefits rather than sustaining the]{.underline}
**[l]{.underline}**iberal **[i]{.underline}**nternational
**[o]{.underline}**rder. Indeed, [much of Asia views the liberal order
with **ambivalence**. When Asian countries talk about a "rules-based
order," the phrase tends to carry **significantly different meanings**
than it does in the West]{.underline}.

For Asia, far more than a radical deviation from existing U.S. foreign
policy, [Trump's return to power **amplifies** and **accelerates a
trend** that has been underway since the **Vietnam** era.
The]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [is
**not in retreat** and has **not embraced isolation**]{.underline}.
Instead, [it is expanding the **geographic scope** of the approach
that]{.underline} U.S. President Richard [**Nixon** first introduced in
East Asia during the **Cold War**, by **unilaterally redefining** the
terms of its global engagements and by becoming **more circumspect**
about when and how it gets involved internationally. Having dealt with
such a]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[for almost **half a century**, Asia is **not unduly agitated** about a
second Trump administration]{.underline}. This is not to discount
important concerns in the region, including about tariff policies and
Taiwan. But it does mean that [Asian countries are **more accustomed**
to Trump's transactionalism]{.underline}, and their experience holds
important lessons for other U.S. partners and allies as they adjust to
Washington's recalibration of the way it works with the world.

HESITANT HEGEMON

[For **many** Asian states, Trump's "America first" approach echoes the
strategy Washington **has used** toward much of Asia for **more than
five decades**. In 1969, as he attempted to disengage the United States
from an unwinnable war in **Vietnam**, Nixon unveiled a new strategy
aimed at U.S. allies, partners, and friends in the region. "**Except
for** the threat of a major power involving **nuclear weapons**," Nixon
said, in announcing that summer what came to be known as the **Nixon
Doctrine**, "the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [is going to **encourage** and has a **right to
expect** that \[**military defense**\] will be **handled by**, and
**responsibility** for it **taken by**, the **Asian nations
themselves**."]{.underline}

As Nixon saw it, the **[Vietnam]{.underline}** War [was a **sobering
lesson** for American policy. Rather than getting **dragged into** other
Asian quagmires, Washington would **maintain stability** as an
**offshore balancer**, without deploying **troops on the ground**. This
meant that the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [would provide a **nuclear umbrella** of
**extended deterrence**, as well as a **military presence** centered on
**air and naval bases** in Japan and Guam, but countries in the
**region**]{.underline}---with the partial exception of South Korea
because of the unique threat from North Korea---[would be expected to
**provide for their own** security. No longer could they count on
Washington to **directly intervene** as it did in Vietnam]{.underline}.

### Transition\-\--AT: China Can't Lead\-\--2NC

#### China decline is [all hype]{.underline}.

**Cunningham 7/10** \[Michael Cunningham is a Non-Resident Fellow at the
Center for China Studies, National Taiwan University, where he focuses
on China's domestic politics and foreign policy. "China coup? Rumours of
Xi Jinping's decline are premature."

//aka

[In recent weeks, a flurry of reports has predicted the imminent
downfall of China's President Xi Jinping. Similar rumours have surfaced
repeatedly over his 13-year rule -- and **each time have proven false.**
While scepticism about Xi's invincibility is warranted, history suggests
that today's chatter will likely also turn out to be
**unfounded.**]{.underline}

To be sure, something strange is happening in Beijing. Since Xi began
his third term in 2022, several of his hand-picked appointees have been
removed, prompting speculation about a power struggle in the Chinese
Communist Party. Most of the activity has occurred in the military,
leading some to conclude that Xi is losing control of the armed forces.
But not all analysts agree with this assessment. Some see the intrigue
as evidence of Xi's further consolidation of power or even as infighting
among his subordinates that has no effect on him.

[Despite the noise, no one has **credibly explained** how a leader who
dominates every significant CCP organisation could be
toppled.]{.underline} All seven members of the Politburo Standing
Committee are either long-time Xi allies or have served him loyally for
over a decade. More than half of the broader Politburo's 24 members are
his protégés, and nearly all the others had direct ties to him prior to
their appointments. [The factions rumoured to be plotting against Xi
**lack meaningful representation** in the bodies that appoint and remove
senior officials. The notion that these sidelined groups have somehow
outmanoeuvred a political operator as shrewd and relentless as Xi
strains credulity.]{.underline}

[Nor has Xi made a recent blunder so catastrophic that it would convince
his allies that his continued rule is a liability to the
Party.]{.underline} His Covid-19 strategy collapsed in 2022, resulting
in a year of widespread lockdowns that stalled economic activity,
threatened social stability, and saddled provincial governments with
dangerous levels of debt. But that was three years ago. [Instead of
punishing Xi, the Party awarded him a precedent-breaking third term and
allowed him to further consolidate his control.]{.underline}

For all the turbulence of Xi's tenure, [**the CCP generally views him as
a success**. Xi has presided over China's rise as a global power and
reasserted the Party's control of society more comprehensively than any
leader since Mao. Though his handling of the economy and of US-China
relations has drawn some criticism, few believe removing him would erase
US tariffs or improve China's global standing. If anything, Xi is
credited with **forcing Washington back to the negotiating table** in
the latest trade standoff.]{.underline}

Some reports claim that Zhang Youxia, vice chairman of the Central
Military Commission and a longtime Xi ally, is plotting his removal --
possibly through a coup. If true, this would be seismic. However, these
[assertions stem from **overseas dissident outlets** with a mixed track
record for accuracy]{.underline}. Crucially, they offer no compelling
explanation for why Zhang would turn on Xi, especially after Xi retained
him in 2022 despite Zhang's having surpassed the customary retirement
age.

Rumours and coded messages can offer valuable clues about cracks within
the Chinese leadership. However, such signals are open to
interpretation.

[Much of the narrative around Xi's supposed decline relies on
**selective, often decontextualised, observations.** Critics point to
his absence from this week's BRICS Summit in Brazil but overlook his
three overseas trips so far this year -- consistent with recent patterns
-- and the **steady stream** of foreign leaders he continues to host in
Beijing.]{.underline}

Others overinterpret isolated state media reports that fail to mention
Xi's honorifics, overlooking the fact that most official discourse
continues to emphasise his central role. And, contrary to claims of Xi's
declining media presence, [a recent China Media Project study found that
references to him are holding firm in 2025, with no other senior leader
gaining visibility at his expense.]{.underline}

Rumours and coded messages can offer valuable clues about cracks within
the Chinese leadership. However, such signals are open to interpretation
and often reflect more hopeful speculation than hard evidence.

[If Xi's position were truly in jeopardy, we wouldn't need to rely
entirely on parsing obscure policy documents for clues.]{.underline}
Removing the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao would likely
resemble past episodes of political upheaval, which brought down some of
the most senior Party figures. The turbulent Mao era, for example, saw
CCP Vice-Chairman Liu Shaoqi purged and summarily placed under house
arrest and his successor, Lin Biao -- once Mao's "closest
comrade-in-arms" -- killed in a suspicious plane crash while fleeing the
country. These are just two examples of a string of decidedly unsubtle
events.

[Today's China, by comparison, appears **relatively
stable.**]{.underline} The most senior figure believed to have been
ousted during Xi's third term is He Weidong, a Politburo member and vice
chairman of the Central Military Commission, who hasn't been seen since
March. This is significant, but He -- admittedly a Xi ally -- is not
generally understood to be part of his inner circle. If some of Xi's
closest allies -- Cai Qi or Ding Xuexiang, for example -- are targeted,
that will be a more likely sign of trouble for Xi.

[If Xi Jinping truly faces serious internal challenges, such overt
indicators will eventually appear. For now, however, the evidence
suggests **Xi remains firmly in control.**]{.underline}

### Transition\-\--AT: China-Led Order Bad\-\--2NC

#### Ceding hegemony shifts to [multipolarity]{.underline}. China will be the [leader]{.underline}, but not the [hegemon]{.underline}\-\--they'll be checked by [regional powers]{.underline}.

A Multipolar Regional Order

[The **long-term** direction of movement]{.underline}, then, [is **away
from US leadership** and toward a **multipolar regional order**. China
will be the **leader**; that much is certain. But whether it becomes the
**dominant power** is still **unsettled** and is something that **all
Asian countries** can have a **role in deciding**. For America's allies
and partners in Asia, the comfort of **post-Cold War US hegemony is
over**, and they cannot bring it back. But that **doesn't mean** China
will be the new hegemon]{.underline}. China will mostly have its way
with smaller countries on its borders; Beijing is already establishing a
sphere of influence on continental Southeast Asia. But Asia is mostly a
maritime realm, and that favors the countries that want to constrain
China because [power is difficult to project over the vast spaces of
maritime Asia]{.underline}.

[We may thus see the slow development of **competing**]{.underline}
**[s]{.underline}**pheres **[o]{.underline}**f
**[i]{.underline}**nfluence [in Asia, **geographic sub-regions** in
which one great power dominates and others do not interfere. The US is
the obvious leader for **one** such sphere in North Asia, but its
**commitment** to maintain such an order is **questionable**, so at the
very least, **Japan** and]{.underline} **[So]{.underline}**uth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea [will have to do more **heavy
lifting**]{.underline}, including perhaps by building their own nuclear
weapons. South Korea is the most likely candidate because there is
strong public support for an independent deterrent, and Seoul has
already developed strategic weapons systems (such as submarine-launched
ballistic missiles) designed to carry nuclear weapons. Indeed, if there
is one US ally in Asia which has not behaved like a startled kangaroo in
the headlights, it is South Korea, which has steadily developed more
capable deterrence forces that don't rely on the US.

The most promising path toward peace in Asia is a balance of power based
on spheres of influence, and that is the direction the region appears to
be drifting toward. Without ever formally conceding its claim to
regional hegemony, [the US has **implicitly accepted that hegemony is
unsustainable**]{.underline}. What remains far from settled, however, is
the question of boundaries: where does one side's sphere of influence
end and another's begin? [Any discussion of Asian geopolitics inevitably
comes back to **Taiwan**]{.underline}, and this is where the question of
boundaries is most clearly in dispute. To whose sphere of influence does
Taiwan belong? The answer to that question will determine the fate of
the region, and the safety of the world.

#### Reports show that as the US [retrenches]{.underline}, China is [rapidly]{.underline} expanding their international diplomacy\-\--proves they will [fill in]{.underline} AND maintain [liberal norms]{.underline}.

WASHINGTON, July 14 (Reuters) - [**China is increasing its diplomatic
reach as President Donald Trump\'s administration pares back America\'s
international presence**, Democrats from the U.S. Senate Foreign
Relations Committee said in a report released on Monday.]{.underline}

[The report, the result of **months of staff travel and research**, was
released as the Trump administration makes deep cuts to the State
Department, including beginning on Friday to fire more than 1,350
U.S.-based employees, part of a total reduction of nearly 3,000 people
for the U.S.-based workforce.]{.underline}

[The administration has also cut **billions of dollars in foreign
aid**]{.underline}, effectively [shutting down the U.S. Agency for
International Development, which funded the majority of U.S.
humanitarian and development assistance worldwide.]{.underline} That led
to the firing of thousands of its employees and contractors and the
[slashing of more than **80% of its programs.**]{.underline}

Critics said the [cuts would undermine Washington\'s ability to defend
and promote U.S. interests abroad.]{.underline} Research published in
The Lancet medical journal said the cuts to USAID and its dismantling
could result in more than 14 million additional deaths by 2030.

[\"Within days of the Trump administration taking office and starting to
roll back our commitments around the world, China was already labeling
the United States an unreliable partner,\" Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the
top committee Democrat, told reporters on a conference call about the
report.]{.underline}

**[\"At a time when we\'re retreating, they are expanding their
footprint,\"]{.underline}** she said.

The Trump administration says its changes help align foreign policy with
Trump\'s \"America First\" agenda, and are part of a push to shrink the
federal bureaucracy and cut what Trump officials say has been wasteful
spending.

Trump has said the U.S. pays disproportionately for foreign aid and he
wants other countries to shoulder more of the burden.

The Democrats\' 91-page report listed ways, [from broadcasting to health
programs and development efforts, that committee researchers said
**China is expanding its influence.**]{.underline}

[It lists dozens of cases in which the committee researchers found that
**China had stepped in as the U.S. eliminated or cut back international
programs**, from funding vaccines and providing food to infrastructure
development.]{.underline}

[For example, in Africa, as the U.S. terminated food assistance
programs, China in March donated \$2 million in rice to Uganda. In May,
after the U.S. terminated a \$37 million HIV/AIDS grant in Zambia, China
said it would help the African nation fight HIV/AIDS, including by
donating 500,000 rapid HIV testing kits and planning more meetings to
discuss its continued partnership on the issue.]{.underline}

In Southeast Asia, [Chinese President Xi Jinping embarked on a tour to
meet with leaders in Vietnam, Cambodia and Malaysia, the report said.
The trip yielded an agreement in Vietnam for railroad connections, 37
cooperation agreements in Cambodia in sectors including energy,
education and infrastructure and technical and manufacturing exchanges
in Malaysia.]{.underline}

[And in Latin America, China in May hosted the \"China-Latin American
and the Caribbean Forum\" and announced it would provide a \$9 billion
credit line and additional infrastructure investments for the
region.]{.underline}

### Transition\-\--AT: Retrenchment Bad\-\--2NC

#### It's [inevitable]{.underline}, clinging is [bad]{.underline}, AND [empirically disproven]{.underline}.

[For the **past 30 years**, America has been playing a game of
**whack-a-mole**, trying desperately to **beat back** any threats to its
**unipolar hegemony**. But if recent reports are any indication, that
game may soon be **coming to a close**]{.underline}. Whether or not that
ending is a bad thing depends entirely on how American leaders proceed.

[The announcement that **BRICS**]{.underline}---the loose alliance of
Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, [an answer of sorts to
the G7---are about to expand has produced much **teeth gnashing**. The
addition of Saudi Arabia, Iran, the UAE, Ethiopia, Egypt, and Argentina
has been portrayed by some as the **end** of American and Western
**hegemony**]{.underline}. Brazil's president declared that the world
"will no longer be the same." French President Emmanuel [Macron lamented
that the expansion was a **threat** to the **Western
order**]{.underline}.

To be clear, the states being added to BRICS are no small fish: Saudi
Arabia has long been a key American partner, and Iran has long been a
serious American enemy. That they are both joining together in one
organization is noteworthy. Likewise, Argentina's addition may indicate
the bloc is strengthening in South America. And there are many nations
who are willing to join, from Indonesia to Algeria to Venezuela.

But there are many reasons to resist any teeth gnashing.

For starters, there is nothing inherently linking the core group
members. The original name was coined by an economist who, in 2001,
calculated that in 2050 those five countries would dominate the global
economy. Today, such a prediction would almost seem farcical. While
China and India are of course big players in the international arena,
China's growth is already beginning to slow down, and the notion that
Russia or South Africa will be dominating the global economy in 30 years
is almost silly.

Secondly, many of its members are friendly with the United States. Just
because a state is now a BRICS member does not mean they will always be,
nor does it mean that they have stabbed America in the back. India's
Prime Minister Narendra Modi had a close personal relationship with
former President Donald Trump, as did former Brazilian President Jair
Bolsonaro, who only just barely lost his re-election campaign. Likewise,
while Argentina is currently led by the center-left, it may be about to
elect a libertarian who has already declared his intention to withdraw
from BRICS should he become president.

Thirdly, this is not a military organization; even if it was, as it is
so spread out, it would be impossibly unwieldy. Instead, it is
essentially a discussion forum. And with even more voices---some of
whom, like Saudi Arabia, are not as opposed to the West as are, say,
China and Russia---the impact of the group may very well be diluted by
more membership, rendering it even less of a threat to the West.

But with this all said, expansion should not inherently be dismissed;
with China leading the way, the group certainly is aimed at ending
Western hegemony and very well could succeed in at least in heavily
chipping away at it. However, one then has to consider the question:
**[why]{.underline}**, exactly, [should America be concerned over losing
hegemony?]{.underline}

[Historically speaking, **no nation in history** has had the **sort of
hegemony** America enjoys]{.underline}. Its potential impending loss of
hegemony is frequently compared to the Roman Empire\'s loss of hegemony.
But [Rome's hegemony was **fundamentally different** from America's:
while the empire did rule its world, its "world" was that of the
Mediterranean and Western Europe. Any crack in its hegemony meant a
**literal crack** in the empire]{.underline}.

[Upon losing their hegemony, the Eastern Roman Empire **lasted for
another 900 years**, for much of that time as a **major regional
power**. While the loss of the British Empire's hegemony post-World War
II meant a severe decline of status, the tiny British Isles always
**depended upon its colonies** for greatness; America has **no such
dependency**]{.underline}. Plus, [Britain's hegemony **never reached
America's extent**, and was **frequently challenged** by France and then
Germany---twice]{.underline}.

[America losing hegemony is less of a decline and more of a **reversion
to reality**, the end of an **inflation**]{.underline}. Realist scholars
from Henry Kissinger on down have consistently argued that, generally,
[world order reacts **against unipolarity**. For 30 years America has
desperately tried to **taper down** any challenges to its rule; it is
only natural that eventually, those being tapered down would **prefer
having it another way**]{.underline}.

[The fact that America has benefited from the unipolar moment as long as
it has is an **historically unprecedented occurrence**. But as that
hegemony inevitably **comes to an end**, we can]{.underline}---instead
of raging against the wind---[**manage the transition** from a unipolar
order to a multipolar order in a way which best suits us]{.underline}.
The United States can maintain its borders and its security by ensuring
anti-Americanism does not pervade Western Europe or East Asia in a sort
of Monroe+ Doctrine. It could insist on the European Union truly
integrating the defense capabilities of its member states. We can work
to establish potential multipolar powers, like Japan or even Australia,
as those who can stand on their own two feet, instead of trying to grab
as much sand as possible, just to see it slip through our fingers.

[The problem with playing whack-a-mole is that it is **essentially
unwinnable**. Every game ends the same way: the **time runs out**. You
can compare your score to others, but when it comes to states attempting
to ensure their security, the impressiveness of such scores **only
matters in history books** written decades or centuries after the fact.
"Rome lasted for such a long time" was probably **small comfort** to
those still living there when the **barbarians were at the
gates**]{.underline}.

[Which means America can desperately keep trying to batter down the
moles---and in doing so, can **fail** to establish a security
architecture for the **coming multipolar world**---or we can **stop
playing a losing game**, face **reality**, and work on securing
ourselves for the rest of the century]{.underline}.

Scholars see these developments as [signs of a general **power
transition** away from the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. During such transitions, the leading
power---or "hegemon"---faces increasing difficulties in maintaining its
preferred international order; its relative decline encourages other
states unhappy with that order to seek to renegotiate terms, build
alternative arrangements of one kind or another, probe for weaknesses,
and even directly challenge the dominant power or its allies. [In the
**worst-case scenario**, peaceful adjustment to the changing
distribution of military and economic capabilities proves
impossible]{.underline}; as it did in World War I and World War II, [the
system collapses into a devastating great-power war]{.underline}.9

[This possibility]{.underline}, which political scientist Graham Allison
calls [the "**Thucydides Trap**," is currently something of a **minor
obsession** in foreign policy circles]{.underline}. However, **[American
hegemony can unravel without anyone ever firing a shot]{.underline}**.
In this book, we contend that [the international system has **already
gone** quite far down **several** pathways **out of hegemony**. These
include **great power challenges**, changing **behavior** of small or
weaker states, and new forms of **transnationalism** that **destabilize
previous norms** and **agreed-upon**]{.underline}
**[fo]{.underline}**reign **[po]{.underline}**licy
**[frameworks]{.underline}**. President [Trump may be **speeding up**
the journey, but **major drivers** of hegemonic unraveling **predate
him** and will **continue after** his presidency]{.underline}. Indeed,
[Trump himself is as much a symptom of these developments as a cause,
which has implications for those hoping to reverse his impact on
international order]{.underline}.

[Less than six months into U.S. President Donald Trump's second term,
his administration's foreign policy has generated widespread dismay and
confusion at home and abroad]{.underline}. The use of tariffs against
allies and adversaries; the threats to annex Canada, Greenland, and
Panama; and the unusually blunt criticism of Washington's closest
partners appear both arbitrary and destructive, especially to
policymakers who have spent their professional lives managing the
U.S.-led international order. They believe that creating order in a
world full of complex transnational challenges requires alliances,
credibility, and soft power---precisely what the Trump administration
seems bent on destroying.

[Aspects of its policies may be difficult to understand, but there is a
logic at the core of the administration's national security
strategy.]{.underline} [The [Trump
administration](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/topics/trump-administration) sees
the previous U.S. strategy---which aimed to build and maintain a global
order led by the United States---as a misguided effort that has sapped
U.S. power.]{.underline} It views Washington's moves to cultivate soft
power as leading to meddling and overstretch, and [it perceives highly
credible American security guarantees as encouraging most of the United
States' allies to reduce their defense efforts and rely on its
protection.]{.underline}

Instead of trying to create global order, the [Trump administration now
appears to be pursuing a more focused strategy:
prioritization.]{.underline} Its reasoning is simple. [The [United
States](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/regions/united-states) has
limited resources and China is its greatest geopolitical threat, so
Washington must energize recalcitrant allies around the world to manage
their own regions, freeing the United States to concentrate on
Asia.]{.underline}

At this early stage, prioritization is only one of several approaches
the Trump administration may pursue. But for now, signs of
prioritization are evident in the administration's words and actions. In
the Interim National Defense Strategic Guidance, circulated at the
Pentagon in March[, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth described China as
"the Department's sole pacing threat" and the "denial of a Chinese fait
accompli seizure of Taiwan---while simultaneously defending the U.S.
homeland" as "the Department's sole pacing scenario."]{.underline} This
echoed ideas promoted for years by Elbridge Colby, who is now the
undersecretary of defense for policy and whose 2021 book, *The Strategy
of Denial:* *American Defense in an Age of Great Power Conflict*,
contended that the top priority of U.S. foreign policy was to assemble
an "anti-hegemonic coalition" in Asia to prepare for the possibility of
"a war with China over Taiwan."

In practice, the logic of prioritization clarifies many of the Trump
administration's actions with regard to Europe. [Tough talk
to [NATO](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/topics/nato) allies is meant to
convince them that they can no longer rely on Washington and must do
more for themselves.]{.underline} Ending the war in Ukraine quickly and
bringing peace to the continent would enable the United States to reduce
its military presence there and focus its resources on Asia. Even the
schisms between the United States and Europe over the terms of a
settlement between Russia and Ukraine are connected to prioritization.
European leaders insist that the U.S. military play a major role in
monitoring a peace deal because they desperately want to keep the United
States in Europe; the Trump administration wants those responsibilities
to rest on European shoulders because it wants out.

The principles of prioritization predate the Trump administration, and
they will likely endure beyond it. [Every U.S. president since [Barack
Obama](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/topics/barack-obama-administration) has
tried to "pivot" U.S. national security focus from Europe to Asia,
because they have all understood that the greater threat to the United
States lies in Asia and that U.S. allies in Europe have more capacity to
defend themselves]{.underline}. If Trump's team can make this titanic
shift happen---if it can draw down U.S. forces in Europe and concentrate
U.S. military strength in Asia---future presidents are unlikely to shift
back.

When the United States faced another rising great-power rival, the
Soviet Union, in the late 1940s, it adopted a strategy that became known
as containment to counter the threat. That strategy was initially flawed
but refined over time. The first version of prioritization, too, has
important weaknesses. Although the strategy is built on the recognition
that U.S. resources are limited, the Trump administration has requested
higher defense spending. And although [prioritization is designed to
prevent China's domination of East Asia]{.underline}, some of the Trump
administration's policies may be courting unnecessary danger in pursuit
of that objective. Policymakers will now have to work through these
tensions in the new U.S. strategy. In one form or another,
prioritization is here to stay.

**THE STRATEGIC EQUATION**

For more than three decades, since the end of the [Cold
War](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/tags/cold-war), the United States
has pursued a highly ambitious objective: to create, expand, and lead a
liberal international order. But for the Trump administration, that
order is a fantasy. [Efforts to transform global politics have sapped
American power and left the United States with near-constant wars, an
overextended military, and free-riding allies. Liberal principles such
as free trade and the right to asylum, although appealing in theory,
robbed the United States of the ability to preserve its domestic
industrial power and control its border. Maintaining the international
order, prioritizers say, has meant putting the United States
second]{.underline}.

Prioritization reframes U.S. national security policy by focusing on the
safety, prosperity, and social cohesion of the United States. But
prioritizers are not isolationists who want to concentrate only on
homeland defense. Instead, [this strategy offers a middle position
between isolationism and the longtime U.S. strategy of global
leadership. It narrows the goals of U.S. foreign policy to focus on the
country's most urgent threat---the rise of a rival regional hegemon,
China---in order to avoid overstretching the United States' finite
resources.]{.underline}

A reckoning with the end of U.S. primacy has driven this shift in
strategy. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the United States faced no
superpower rivals and could therefore act as what former U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright called the "indispensable nation," the
country that would solve conflicts and lead multilateral efforts around
the globe. Those days are gone. Prioritizers condemn that kind of global
activism as producing what Colby has described as "overextension" in
pursuit of "wildly ambitious goals" predicated on "a gauzy conception of
the 'sacredness' of alliances without real strength or prudence to back
it up."

Fiscal constraints reinforce the call for greater discipline in U.S.
foreign policy. The United States has amassed \$29 trillion in public
debt, roughly equal to the country's GDP. To make matters worse, the
federal budget deficit, at more than six percent of GDP, is higher today
than at any time in the past century (except for periods of war or
severe economic downturn), pushing the national debt ever higher. And as
the U.S. population ages, federal spending on Medicare and Social
Security will also increase. As Americans face difficult tradeoffs
between spiraling debts, higher taxes, and entitlement reform, it will
become harder to pay for the type of military that a strategy of global
leadership requires.

There is a logic at the core of Trump's national security strategy.

[China, meanwhile, has become a far more powerful rival than the Soviet
Union ever was.]{.underline} It is an economic peer of the United States
and
a [leader](https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501784149/autocracy-20/#bookTabs=1) in
many critical technologies. [Beijing is rapidly building up its
conventional military capabilities and nuclear arsenal, which were once
areas of comparative weakness. Competing with China will therefore
require focused U.S. attention, leaving Washington with little time and
few resources to manage the world.]{.underline}

[Prioritization is a realist strategy,]{.underline} and what keeps
realists up at night is the [threat of a rival great power controlling
an economically vital part of the world.]{.underline} Historically, that
fear drew the United States into World War I, World War II, and the Cold
War. Were a powerful U.S. adversary to gain regional dominance, the
thinking goes, [it could use that position to structure world politics
in ways that harm the United States, such as by weaponizing trade and
isolating the United States diplomatically.]{.underline}

Today, the only vital region with a potential rival hegemon is Asia. [In
Europe, Russia is aggressive but completely outmatched]{.underline}. It
has around one-third the population and one-tenth the GDP of the
European Union, and it lags far behind Europe in the emerging
technologies that will drive economic growth and warfighting in the
future. European countries therefore have plenty of latent power to
contain Russia; they merely need to mobilize it. The balance of power is
more lopsided in Asia. [China has the demographic, economic, and
technological might to dominate maritime East Asia and seems intent on
doing so. Using "gray zone" tactics, including coercive diplomacy and
military pressure,]{.underline} Beijing is increasing its control over
disputed territory in the South China and East China Seas[. To pressure
Taiwan, in particular, China conducts influence operations,
cyberattacks, and military incursions. It isolates Taipei
diplomatically, denying it membership in international
institutions]{.underline}. And all the while, China is modernizing its
military and conducting exercises to prepare for a blockade or invasion
of Taiwan. In the logic of prioritization, because Beijing has both the
will and the ability to achieve regional hegemony, it poses a threat the
United States must counter.

To balance [China](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/regions/china) but
avoid overstretching U.S. resources, prioritization calls for a U.S.
military drawdown in nonprioritized regions. This includes Europe, where
the United States currently devotes significant attention and military
capacity. Washington must convince all of its allies, but particularly
those in Europe, to enhance their own defenses. This step is essential
because a weak ally could become a target of aggression, which would
force the United States to come to its aid. European allies must be made
to understand that the United States will only be their last line of
defense---compelling them to coordinate among themselves and generate
real domestic defense capabilities.

**DELIVERING THE PIVOT**

[The concerns that drive prioritization also did not begin with Trump.
In 2011, Obama declared a pivot of U.S. diplomatic, economic, and
military resources to Asia to address China's growing power and
influence.]{.underline} But the pivot was less doctrine, more New Year's
resolution---proclaimed, then abandoned. The Obama administration urged
U.S. allies in both Asia and Europe to spend more on defense, but those
pleas were ignored. American attention eventually strayed to the Middle
East as civil wars erupted in the wake of the Arab uprisings of 2011,
and to Europe after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. The pivot was put on
hold.

The first Trump administration renewed U.S. focus on Asia. Its [2017
National Security Strategy highlighted threats from China and Russia and
emphasized the Indo-Pacific region as a priority theater.]{.underline}
Trump, as a candidate and later as president, shocked European allies
with his remarks criticizing their failure to meet NATO spending
targets, and he warned that the United States might not protect allies
that did not adequately fund their own defense. In 2020, the Trump
administration even announced the withdrawal of 12,000 U.S. troops from
Germany, although the Biden administration canceled this plan the
following year.

When President Joe Biden came into office, his administration sought to
repair relations with European countries, but it also tried to direct
additional attention to Asia. It presented the withdrawal of U.S. troops
from Afghanistan in 2021 as a move that would permit greater focus on
the Indo-Pacific. Through a "latticework" of security and economic
initiatives with various regional partners, it sought to construct a
counter-China coalition; through multilateral arms export controls, it
sought to limit Chinese military might. But when war broke out in
Ukraine in 2022 and in Gaza the next year, the Indo-Pacific once again
took a back seat.

With prioritization, the second Trump administration is delivering the
pivot that was long promised but never executed. [Under this strategy,
the United States would accelerate its preparations for a conflict in
East Asia, with particular focus on the defense of Taiwan. To deter
China and to improve U.S. warfighting capability, the United States
would seek to restore its own weakened defense industrial
base.]{.underline} It would maintain export controls that are designed
to deny China cutting-edge weapons. Beyond the military realm,
Washington would counter Beijing's regional economic influence with new
trade, technology, and development initiatives.

Prioritization would still see the United States coordinating and
training with its allies, as well as seeking increased defense
contributions from them. Most of their defense budgets fall near or
below the global average as a share of GDP, which is inadequate given
the high threat they face. The United States cannot contain a superpower
without allied support---containing the Soviet Union required the
mobilization of Western Europe, particularly the military capabilities
of West Germany. At its peak, the Bundes­wehr deployed a force that in
size and capability was the equal of the U.S. Army in Europe. Just as
NATO countries mobilized to counter the Soviet threat, Japan, South
Korea, Taiwan, and others must do the same to counter China today.

The shift of U.S. resources and attention to Asia will also mean
resetting European expectations about the American role in any future
European conflict. Since the late 1940s, U.S. deployments on the
continent ensured that the United States would be the first to join the
fight and would supply the largest contingent of forces. Prioritization
would change that. The United States would stay in NATO, expecting to
help defend its allies should the need arise, according to Article 5 of
the alliance's charter. But the United States would reduce its ground
and air forces stationed in Europe in peacetime, perhaps transferring
some of them to Asia.

For decades, U.S. military planners have spent their days figuring out
how to rapidly introduce forces to Europe in the event of a conflict.
Now, the U.S. goal would be the opposite. According to the logic of
prioritization, the U.S. military would reduce its ability to quickly
deploy large numbers of troops across the Atlantic. Like other NATO
allies, instead of arriving on day one with the preponderance of forces,
the United States would plan to arrive later and with less. Only by
removing this safety net can Washington push NATO allies to assume the
financially and politically difficult task of taking the lead in their
own defense.

European countries will have to adjust to this new normal. Most NATO
armies are underfunded and undersized, lacking the personnel necessary
to sustain high-intensity operations. They rely on the United States to
provide key capabilities, notably command-and-control and functions
related to intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. European
countries must overcome political disunity and serious budgetary
problems to restore the continent's military power and fill the gaps
that a diminished U.S. contribution would leave. The good news is that,
with massive economic and technological advantages over Russia, Europe
has the latent capability to address the threat.

**THIS IS HAPPENING**

For decades, U.S. and European diplomats described their alliance using
words such as "ironclad" and "shoulder to shoulder" to nodding heads in
Brussels conference rooms, at the annual Munich Security Conference, and
at World War II commemorations. This language sought to assure anxious
Europeans that the United States could be relied on to protect European
security.

Trump tore up the script. In a memorable photo from a G-7 summit during
his first term, the U.S. president sat, arms crossed, glaring at an
indignant German Chancellor Angela Merkel. This February, Trump and Vice
President JD Vance welcomed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to
the White House, only to berate him on television. When Vance attended
the Munich Security Conference the same month, instead of delivering the
usual soothing words, he lambasted Europeans for shirking on defense and
for stifling freedom of expression in their countries. Next came
punishing tariffs and reports of senior U.S. officials insulting
European allies on a leaked Signal chat. To Kaja Kallas, the EU's top
foreign policy official, it looked as if the United States were "trying
to pick a fight" with Europe.

The Trump administration doesn't want a fight, exactly, but a
separation. Its effort to create political distance from Europe advances
its desired shift in U.S. strategy: to convince---truly
convince---European foreign policy elites that there will not be a
return to the "ironclad" relationship and that the United States will no
longer provide the continent's first line of defense.

The change in the way Washington talks to and about Europe is not the
only evidence of a shift toward prioritization. In Ukraine, the Trump
administration is trying to end the war quickly in a manner that allows
for a U.S. drawdown from the continent. European peace plans have sought
to keep the United States engaged, proposing, for example, a cease-fire
that would be guaranteed by a U.S. security force. But the Trump
administration has flatly rejected that prospect. In the logic of
prioritization, a U.S.-led force in Ukraine would be a strategic mistake
since it would trap the United States in a European quagmire, preventing
it from pivoting to Asia and allowing NATO allies to offload
responsibility.

By pushing for an end to the war, the Trump administration is trying to
create a future that European countries can manage on their own. A
smaller U.S. presence would ease Europe into de facto recognition of
Russia's core interests near its borders, leaving Ukraine outside NATO.
Compared with a situation in which the EU or, worse, NATO pushed
eastward, which would provoke Moscow, this would reduce (if not
eliminate) a key source of conflict between Europe and Russia. As long
as European countries commit the financial and political resources
necessary to develop strong defenses, they should be able to deter
future Russian aggression---even from a Russia emboldened by gains in
Ukraine and a U.S. withdrawal from the continent.

**MOVING ON**

[Prioritization has attracted criticism not only from horrified European
allies but also from American advocates of the previous U.S. strategy of
global leadership]{.underline}. In the United States, those advocates on
the center left and center right share the view that a militarily
powerful United States, with a large network of alliances, provides
essential, pacifying leadership in global politics. [They argue that, as
the strongest country in the world, the United States still has
sufficient economic and military power to defend multiple
regions]{.underline}. Some also downplay the threat posed by Beijing,
arguing that China's power is exaggerated and that the country faces
serious demographic and economic challenges that undermine its
capability to establish regional hegemony. Voting against Colby's
confirmation in April, [Senator Mitch McConnell]{.underline}, a
conservative advocate of U.S. global leadership, [condemned the
prioritization strategy Colby supports as "geostrategic self-harm that
emboldens our adversaries and drives wedges between America and our
allies" that those adversaries then exploit]{.underline}.

The outcry from many parts of the foreign policy establishment at the
Trump administration's gutting of foreign aid encapsulates the
differences between the old and new strategies. To those who favor a
strategy of American global leadership, the move was callous and
irresponsible, damaging U.S. credibility and squandering the
relationships and soft power that Washington has built over decades.

[For the administration, the disruption was exactly the
point.]{.underline} [Trump's foreign policy team dismisses soft power as
a tool for managing a global order that it no longer intends to
lead.]{.underline} [U.S. policies today are aimed not at reassuring
American allies but at energizing them]{.underline}. Aid programs may
give the United States influence, but the Trump administration sees no
need for that influence because it is not interested in managing
politics across the so-called global South. More to the point, foreign
aid, in the administration's view, is another example of taking care of
the world's problems rather than those of the United States.

Prioritization, like any strategy, comes with tradeoffs. The biggest is
that diminished U.S. credibility may lead to the spread of nuclear
weapons in some regions, an outcome neither prioritizers nor their
critics relish. Already, the Trump administration's efforts to distance
the United States from Europe have fueled doubts about the reliability
of the NATO nuclear sharing program. Since the 1960s, Washington has
promised to transfer nuclear weapons to certain NATO allies in the event
of a major attack. A U.S. pivot away from Europe could undermine faith
in that commitment. Fearing a nuclear threat from Russia, European
countries may then develop a joint nuclear force, or individual
countries such as Germany or Poland could seek independent arsenals.

The possibility of nuclear proliferation is an argument against
prioritization. But if navigating today's world means that countries
must take responsibility for their own national security, then
developments such as a European replacement for the U.S. nuclear
umbrella in Europe may be unavoidable. Washington's handling the
security for the entire "free world" may have sounded plausible in the
late 1990s, when the United States enjoyed a budget surplus, economic
and military primacy, and no rival superpower. In 2025, things are
different. The spread of nuclear weapons would be lamentable, but that
does not change the reality that the global leadership strategy that
prevents it is no longer viable.

**UNANSWERED QUESTIONS**

Prioritization creates additional tensions that must be addressed. For
decades, the credibility of U.S. security promises enabled European
leaders to cut back on defense and spend liberally on social welfare.
They grew dependent on Washington, confident that the United States
would protect them. A prioritization strategy rectifies this problem in
Europe---but invites a similar dynamic in Asia. Having declared that
managing China's rise is the foremost U.S. national security concern,
the United States will have a hard time convincing its Asian allies to
help it balance against China.

Indeed, even when the United States' attention was spread all around the
world and less focused on their region, Asian allies elected to "cheap
ride" on U.S. commitments. For the past few decades, while China rose
and began asserting its claims to disputed territory more forcefully,
Japan's defense spending remained flat at one percent of GDP. During the
same period, defense spending in the Philippines and Taiwan fell. In the
past few years, Japan has made some notable changes to its famously
restrained security policy, including investment in counterstrike
capabilities and a pledge to increase military spending. But Tokyo has
not lifted significant legal limitations on its ability to dispatch
military forces and to cooperate with allies, and its defense spending
remains low, at a planned 1.8 percent of GDP in 2025. Taiwan's defense
spending has also risen in recent years. But despite facing an
existential threat from China, it still spends less than 2.5 percent of
its GDP on defense, which is around the global average. A U.S. pivot to
Asia, with all the resources and promises that come with it, would only
weaken regional allies' incentives to spend more on security.

The Trump administration may be uniquely suited to mitigate this
problem. If there has ever been a U.S. administration that is willing to
work with allies but happy to walk away if they do not step up, it is
this one. [Trump himself has made clear that he is not deeply invested
in alliances or in any particular vision for Asia's future, as long as
it does not include Chinese regional dominance.]{.underline} Both the
Japanese and South Korean governments understand this, which is why
leaders in Tokyo fear Washington will cut some sort of deal with
Beijing, and why leaders in Seoul fear that Trump will reach a nuclear
agreement with North Korea that disadvantages South Korea. To be sure,
motivating allies in Asia to contribute more to their own defense will
be a persistent challenge, but the transactional nature of the Trump
administration may reduce allies' temptation to cheap-ride.

The United States cannot contain a superpower without allied support.

Another problem with prioritization is that it is excessively
confrontational toward China. To deny China regional hegemony, for
example, prioritizers in the Trump administration argue, the United
States must draw a redline between the mainland and Taiwan and enhance
U.S. forces in the region to defend the island. In effect, the United
States is adopting a strategy that would have it fight a war, if need
be, against a nuclear-armed superpower that sees unification with Taiwan
as a matter of national sovereignty. By making it impossible for both
Beijing and Washington to achieve their core interests, prioritization
seems to put the rivals on a collision course.

Finally, although prioritization is driven by an appreciation of U.S.
resource constraints, it does little to ease that pressure. In fact, the
defense budget requested by the Trump administration is as big as or
bigger than those of previous administrations. Meanwhile, U.S. annual
deficits are enormous, debt is mounting, and entitlement spending will
soon rise. And prioritization will only become more expensive if the
United States enters a major war against China.

The solutions to these problems---the strategy's confrontational nature
and its high price tag---may be intertwined. It is not surprising that
the current version of this strategy is rather bold because its main
advocates so far are those analysts and policymakers who have
articulated the clearest vision of the dangers posed by Beijing. They
were so energized by that threat that they made an effective case to
overhaul decades of entrenched U.S. foreign policy thinking.

But even though future prioritizers will similarly focus on preventing
China's regional hegemony, they need not accept the most assertive
version of the strategy. There is nothing about prioritization that
requires the United States to confront China with any
particular* *redlines, set of allies, or military force posture. Where
to draw the redlines and how best to counter Chinese military power in
the region should be---and
are [already](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/taiwan/taiwan-fixation-kavanagh-wertheim) being---[debated](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2022-06-16/consequences-conquest-taiwan-indo-pacific).
Taiwan could be inside the protective bubble or outside it. The United
States could contain China with a full spectrum of offensive military
capabilities or with something closer to a "porcupine" strategy of
strengthening the national defenses of regional partners against Chinese
predation. Some of those more restrained alternatives would demand less
of the U.S. military and thus cost far less, too.

**NO TURNING BACK**

Many advocates of a U.S. global leadership strategy---particularly those
in Europe---hope that the current moment is merely an aberration, that,
as Biden did after taking office in 2021, the next U.S. president will
announce that "America is back." They are likely to be disappointed. The
seeds of prioritization were planted long ago. Since the Obama
administration, all U.S. presidents have recognized the need to shift
U.S. military resources to Asia, and they all wanted NATO allies to do
more for their own defense. But no previous administration was willing
to pay the political costs of making the necessary changes. Now, the
second Trump administration is ripping off the Band-Aid.

Future U.S. administrations may reverse elements of Trump's foreign
policy. They might reinstate foreign aid, arguing that a country as
wealthy as the United States can afford to be charitable. They might
also restaff international institutions or show greater warmth toward
NATO allies. But once scarce defense resources are moved out of Europe,
it is unlikely that another U.S. president would move them back. Asia
needs those resources more than Europe does.

The last time the United States mobilized to confront a rising regional
hegemon, when it embarked on a long-term project to contain the Soviet
Union, the earliest formulations of the strategy were flawed. The first
versions of containment asked little of U.S. allies, relied excessively
on nuclear weapons to deter and wage a potential war, and seriously
considered the possibility of initiating preventive war to defeat the
Soviet threat once and for all. Strategy development is often an
iterative process, and containment was fortunately refined over time.
Washington eventually adopted more sensible approaches that mobilized
the resources of key allies, developed a wiser balance between
conventional and nuclear tools, and assumed a less confrontational
attitude toward Moscow.

[The new U.S. national security strategy is in its early stages and,
like containment, will need to be refined over time. The United States
will be Asia-focused, and China-focused, for many years to
come.]{.underline} It now falls on both supporters and critics of the
Trump administration to develop alternative versions of prioritization
that minimize its costs and risks.

#### Prioritizing resilience is key to national security -- it's the best way to adapt and protect

[Resilience is an essential,]{.underline} yet often publicly
underappreciated, [element of national security]{.underline}. Public
discourse often centers on deterrence, diplomacy, military strength, and
intelligence capabilities. [However, emerging and persistent
threats---from cyberattacks and climate change to pandemics and acute
natural hazards---have revealed significant gaps in national and
international resilience]{.underline} that have pushed the topic much
further up the agenda. Resilience or ['resilience power', is the
foundation on]{.underline} which [hard power' and 'soft
power']{.underline} rest. [Without these]{.underline} elements, [a
nation is exposed and its broader security strategy
weakened.]{.underline} The 2017 US National Security Strategy contains
six references to resilience, compared with thirty-six to defense.14 By
the release of the [2022 US National Security Strategy]{.underline},
there were twenty-nine references to resilience compared with thirty-one
to defense, [reflecting the growing importance of the
topic]{.underline}.15 [It's clear that democracies are increasingly
seeing the need to anticipate, endure, and bounce forward.]{.underline}
Despite the growing focus on resilience in national security and policy
discussions, too little attention has been paid to the factors that
enable individuals to develop and sustain resilience. Governments often
prioritize infrastructure hardening and institutional preparedness while
neglecting the human element. Along with a top-down approach, [the
United States must do more to ensure that citizens are psychologically,
socially, and economically equipped to endure, and emerge well from,
crises. Without]{.underline} addressing [these]{.underline}
individual-level factors, broader resilience and [national security
strategies risk failing]{.underline} at their governments' most
important responsibility: to safe guard citizens. The AANSRI will look
to redress this balance, advocating for increasing focus and attention
on this vital area of resilience work. National security strategies are
valuable opportunities to sur vey the risk landscape and chart a
direction for the future. Yet in a world where specific threats are
difficult to predict, such strategies can quickly feel outdated or
overtaken by events. [A resilience-first approach offers greater
adaptability]{.underline}. Rather than focusing solely on defining
threats and prescribing bespoke solutions, [it equips nations,
communities, and individuals to build the capacity to anticipate
disruption, absorb shocks, and adapt to rapidly changing
circumstances.]{.underline} It demands much more effort to close the
vulnerabilities that adversaries seek to exploit. And it embraces
uncertainty, enabling a more dynamic and enduring form of security. The
COVID-19 pandemic, the [increasing frequency of]{.underline} natural
[disasters]{.underline}, economic [shocks]{.underline}, the rise of
[disinformation]{.underline}, and state-sponsored [cyber]{.underline}
[and sabotage]{.underline} operations have [demonstrated]{.underline}
that [resilience is not just about recovering well but about proactively
reducing risks and ensuring the continuity of society's essential
functions]{.underline}. Inaction in resilience building equates to a
tacit acceptance of risk. When governments, ins titutions, or
communities delay or deprioritize resilience work, they are accepting
the inevitability of system stress and pos sible failure. Inaction is
not a neutral position but a strategic decision to accept the full
impact and cost of disruption rather than mitigate it. There is much
more the US government and civil society could do in all areas of
society to set citizens up for success. Governments, businesses, and
communities must integrate resilience into decision-making at all
levels. This paper argues that [resilience should be viewed not as a
static state but as an evolving "resilience power" capability influenced
by invest ment, governance, technology, and the will of
citizens]{.underline}.

[US resilience as the cornerstone of free world strength]{.underline} A
[strong and sovereign United States, alongside a secure and stable free
world, begins with resilience.]{.underline} In an era of intensifying
geopolitical competition, economic uncertainty, and evolving security
threats, democratic nations must ensure they can withstand, adapt to,
and recover from crises---whether in the form of cyberattacks, supply
chain disruptions, economic coercion, or natural disasters. Resilience
is about ensuring that nations retain the ability to govern, defend, and
prosper under pressure. Collective resilience among democratic allies is
what protects shared values, upholds open societies and economies, and
ensures that no single crisis can fracture the international order.
Without it, fragility in one system or nation can have a com pound
effect. For the free world, including the United States, this imperative
aligns with a belief that security begins at home but extends beyond
borders. Just as energy independence strengthens economic sovereignty,
resilience independence---the ability of nations to sustain themselves
without reliance on adversarial powers (for example, on China's
technology)---fortifies the free world's collective strength. Framing
the conversation The United States and democracies worldwide are already
achieving much on the resilience agenda, with a lot of mutual learning
between friends and allies. The AANSRI task force has not sought to
describe all the existing activity here. Ins tead, its experts have
looked for areas of program work that will add value for governments and
practitioners already wor king hard to tackle these complex challenges.
Prioritizing domestic resilience means ensuring that US com munities,
businesses, and infrastructure can function amid crises without
excessive reliance on federal intervention. [At the same time,
reinforcing resilience across the free wor ld strengthens US national
security, ensuring that allies and partners are not weak links that
adversaries can exploit to un dermine US strength]{.underline}. This
paper presents a framework for resilience that is rooted in
self-reliance, economic strength, and strategic partnerships: [a vision
that places US security and prosperity at the forefront while
reinforcing the stability of democratic allies]{.underline}. In an era
in which adversaries seek to exploit vulnerabilities, resilience must be
a specific pillar of national power, alongside economic competitiveness,
soft power, and military superiority. [A resilient free world is a
strong free world, and a United States that leads on resilience will be
more secure, more prosperous, more in f luential, and more prepared for
the challenges ahead.]{.underline} The AANSRI will provide a center of
new thought leadership on resilience issues, from the role of the
individual up to in ternational collaboration. This paper will set out
some of the avenues of research and practical policy generation that the
initiative can undertake in the coming months and years.

What must democracies be resilient against[? In today's volatile
security environment, it is difficult to make specific predictions about
the future]{.underline}. But looking at some trends and the trajectory
of events can help to determine a broad set of assumptions about the
future risk landscape that democracies might face. To ground the
initiative's discussions and planning, the task force identified three
fundamental assumptions. These are not all theoretical constructs; in
some cases, they reflect real and current challenges that are already
shaping the geopolitical landscape. These assumptions are "best
judgements," and they provide the initiative with a basis for planning.
Because the poten tial breadth of resilience activities is vast, it will
be important to prioritize work streams to achieve maximum impact, with
the understanding that the initiative will need to adapt to and address
unexpected shocks and developments. Democratic societies are
persistently targeted through non-military aggression Hostile state and
non-state actors are engaged in sustained, non-military aggression
against democratic nations. [These threats take multiple forms,
including y cyber campaigns targeting critical infrastructure, go
vernment systems, and financial institutions; y economic coercion and
trade disruptions designed to weaken national economies and strategic
industries; y supply chain manipulation that creates dependencies on
adversarial nations in key sectors such as technolo gy, rare earth
materials, and pharmaceuticals; and y influence operations,
misinformation, and disinfor mation that undermine public trust in
institutions and disrupt social cohesion.]{.underline} The United States
and its allies face a growing risk of military conflict and high-impact
domestic threats There is real potential for democratic societies to
become involved in a military conflict that escalates beyond regional
theaters. If this occurs, adversaries will likely target civilian and
domestic environments, not just military assets. Scenarios could include
y cyber or kinetic attacks on financial systems, energy grids, or water
supplies; y nuclear or non-conventional threats creating wides pread
panic and disruption; and y concurrent and cascading crises, in which a
conflict escalates in tandem with economic, technological, or
environmental disruptions designed to overwhelm response systems.
Chronic global risks endure and require systemic management Long-term,
non-malicious threats remain equally urgent, re quiring resilience
efforts that balance acute security risks with persistent global
challenges. These include y climate change driving extreme weather,
resource scarcity, and mass migration; y food insecurity increasing
geopolitical instability, migra tion, and vulnerability in supply
chains; y anti-microbial resistance (AMR) threatening public health and
economic stability; and y future pandemics remaining high-likelihood
events, even after the COVID-19 pandemic. These risks demand sustained
investment, active manage ment, and strategic coordination, rather than
the reactive ap proaches often seen today. A critical dynamic---the
simultaneity, interdependence, and multiplicity of risks---cuts across
all these domains. In today's interconnected world, crises rarely occur
in isolation. Instead, societies must contend with the reality of
multiple shocks unfolding at once, compounding one another in complex
and unpredictable ways. A cyberattack might coincide with an extreme
weather event; a disinformation campaign might amplify the impact of a
public health emergency. These over lapping disruptions can strain
response systems, compete for resources and attention, and overwhelm
traditional models of governance built to handle sequential crises,
potentially fur ther eroding public confidence in these institutions.
[Therefore, resilience planning must assume the likelihood of compound
and cascading events.  These national security risks are not distant
concerns. They can shape the daily realities of individuals, families,
bu sinesses, and communities]{.underline}. Democratic societies are
already being tested in real time by natural hazards, adversary attacks,
and economic shocks. Developing resilience is not just a mat ter of
preparing for worst-case scenarios, but an urgent and ongoing mission to
safeguard the stability, security, and pros perity of societies

In response to recent U.S. announcements, United Nations Foundation
President and CEO Elizabeth Cousens issued the following statement:

[["U.S. leadership has been a **bulwark of international peace and
prosperity**]{.mark} since 1945 and [indispensable]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
some of the [greatest achievements]{.mark} of our lifetimes --- from
[maintaining]{.mark} the [**nuclear peace**, eradicating]{.mark}
[**disease**,]{.mark} and [lifting over 1 billion]{.mark} people [from
**poverty**,]{.mark} to [creating]{.mark} conditions for pathbreaking
scientific and technological **[innovations]{.mark}**. The health,
safety, and security of Americans has benefited from this leadership,
anchored in unwavering, bipartisan U.S. commitment to an [international
system]{.mark} that can [secure]{.mark} the [rights and interests of all
people and nations]{.mark} through the **rule of law** and shared
values. Strong U.S. partnership with the United Nations has been a
**keystone** of this system.]{.underline}

**[["Our turbulent world needs American leadership now more than
ever.]{.mark} Actions that [weaken U.S.]{.mark} [influence]{.mark} on
the global stage or diminish U.S. voice in leading international
institutions and fora [jeopardize generations of progress and will only
cede ground to others.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

On U.S. Withdrawal from the Paris Agreement:

"[Climate change is already exacting a severe toll across
America]{.underline}, from Hurricane Helene in North Carolina to the
fires currently devastating Los Angeles. Meanwhile, the U.S. states
slashing climate pollution the fastest are simultaneously growing their
economies while employing more clean energy workers than the rest of the
country, showing time and again that climate action is good for jobs,
business, and communities. [The [U.S. plays]{.mark} a [vital]{.mark}
domestic and international [role as a leader in meeting]{.mark} the
[climate challenge]{.mark}, and stands to gain enormous economic
benefits by leading the global clean energy economy of the future. The
[U.S.]{.mark} can commit to a foreign policy that [**accelerates green
investment** and **puts Americans first**]{.mark}, while not
relinquishing America's indispensable international leadership on
climate.]{.underline}

On U.S. Withdrawal from the World Health Organization:

"[Since the U.S. helped establish the World Health Organization nearly
eight decades ago, [WHO]{.mark} has [proved]{.mark} a [vital
contributor]{.mark} to global stability, security, and prosperity ---
preventing the spread of infectious disease, coordinating response to
health emergencies, and standing up global health initiatives that have
saved millions of lives.]{.underline} For less than the annual budget of
some U.S. state health departments, WHO has led efforts to eradicate
smallpox, eliminate malaria in numerous countries, immunize millions
across the world from measles, polio, and other communicable diseases,
and reduce child mortality, among many other accomplishments. The U.S.
also enjoys an outsized voice in WHO --- with more Americans than any
other nationality in leadership positions, and more UN procurement
dollars flowing to the U.S. for medical products than to any other
country. [This critical work that impacts ordinary Americans creates an
opportunity for the U.S. to use the coming months to engage WHO on
precisely the issues that matter most to the health of Americans
everywhere, and exercise leadership that will benefit Americans and the
world.]{.underline}

"Everyday Americans, like citizens of any country, should always get a
strong and convincing argument for why their government's foreign policy
serves their interests and values. [[Active U.S. investment]{.mark} in
international institutions, like the UN, [is in the interest of every
American]{.mark} because it gives American values and influence
unparalleled reach and is a surefire way to [strengthen]{.mark}
[relationships]{.mark} with friends and allies worldwide, [on climate,
health, and many other issues.]{.mark}]{.underline}

["The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [led]{.mark} the [creation of a
stabilizing international system]{.mark} 80 years ago because [it was
good]{.mark} [for the world and for Americans.]{.mark} It was, and
remains, a great deal for the American people --- paying pennies on the
dollar for peace and humanitarian activities that benefit everyone. The
value of this investment was well recognized by the first Trump
Administration, and we hope will inform the engagement of the
second.]{.underline}

["At a moment in human history when we face both challenges and
tremendous possibility on a global, even planetary, scale, [the U.S.

#### Trump has created crisis within the LIO -- international order is key but only the aff revitalizes cooperative US heg to sustain it

First, [we must emphasize that an international order fundamentally
depends on the distribution of power]{.underline} ([Mearsheimer,
2019](https://direct.mit.edu/isec/article/43/4/7/12221/Bound-to-Fail-The-Rise-and-Fall-of-the-Liberal)).
**[Accordingly, any order needs a hegemonic power to promote
it.]{.underline}** [This has been the case for the liberal international
order, promoted under the hegemonic leadership of the United States,
following its ideological victory over the USSR]{.underline}. As a
result, [the US emerged as the hegemonic leade]{.underline}r not only
promoting but also attempting to consolidate this order on a global
scale. However, this order has failed to achieve its goal because it has
only developed in the West and, consequently, remains limited
(Mearsheimer, 2019). There is little evidence that liberalism has been
widely accepted globally; we can find governments grounded in religious
principles (e.g., Iran), autocratic states (e.g., China or Russia), and,
of course, conservative regimes (Mearsheimer, 2019). 

[We are thus witnessing a new distribution of power in which the United
States and its Western allies have clearly seen a decline in their power
and influence.]{.underline} They are finding it increasingly difficult
to impose their agenda and worldview. A clear example is the sanctions
imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, as not all developing
countries are supporting them. [However, it is not entirely accurate to
claim we are now in an order characterized
by multilateralism]{.underline} (Ikenberry, 2018). In fact, there is no
consensus among experts on whether a multilateral order---based on
institutions and states working together toward common goals---should be
considered an irreversible or essential process of the international
system. I would argue we are witnessing an order undergoing the
formation of power poles that are not yet consolidated and are, on the
contrary, in constant flux. 

The recognition of equality among nation-states has not been reflected
in the liberal international order

A second noteworthy aspect is the following. As previously mentioned,
the Westphalian system of 1648 laid the structural foundation of the
international order by attempting to recognize the equality of its
members. However, this [recognition of equality among nation-states has
not been reflected in the liberal international order]{.underline}, as
there is a clear stratification of power among them. It is evident that
[this project has been led by the United States]{.underline} and, to a
lesser extent, its Western allies. Yet, the countries that have joined
or challenged this order---either partially or fully---have not only
questioned US hegemony, but have also argued that their voices and
interests deserve to be heard. 

A third relevant aspect is that the liberal international order, its
institutions, and principles are facing a strong threat from illiberal
powers on the global stage (Ikenberry, 2018; Williams, 2025[). It is
clear that rising revisionist or authoritarian powers, such as China and
Russia, disagree with the way Western powers have sought to shape this
order based on neoliberal ideology and promote it globally since the end
of the Cold War]{.underline}. As Kundnani (2017) notes, [Russia wishes
to return to the order established at the Yalta Conference]{.underline}
(1945), where states with different ideologies and political systems
coexisted. [In contrast, China believes that the state, as a sovereign
entity, should play a central role as the economic and political
regulator of each country, with each state determining its own form of
government]{.underline}. While China recognizes and accepts the
importance of economic globalization, it believes that the state must
ensure its proper functioning and stability. [This explains why
revisionist powers are forming alliances to change the global balance of
power---they do not seem to agree that the United States should remain
the hegemonic power or that the order it promoted should continue to
prevail internationally.]{.underline} 

The international order will only become more stable and legitimate if
it gives developing countries a voice to foster stronger governance

As for national populisms, they can be seen as a symptom of the crisis
of the liberal international order. In fact, populism in the United
States and most Western countries has become an asymmetric
counter-concept to democracy (Houwen, 2011). Populist rhetoric seeks a
supposed or false refounding of democracy around the unity between the
leader and the people, based on the discrediting of traditional
political elites. As a result, there is an antagonistic relationship
between the political elite and the people, who try to express their
interests through politics. This explains why populist movements or
parties use populism as a political strategy, with the populist or
personalist leader governing with the support of followers (Weyland,
2017). We can see this in Western Europe, where populist or far-right
parties are proliferating despite the predominance of liberal or
neoliberal ideology. 

One factor that may explain the rise of these movements or parties is
the widespread distrust of government institutions. According to the
ICIP-Esade EcPol survey *Polarization and coexistence in Spain 2021*,
distrust of Spain's main institutions is notable ([Garmendia, Amuitz and
León Sandra,
2022](https://www.esade.edu/ecpol/en/publications/polarization-and-coexistence-in-spain-2021-the-role-of-the-territories/)).
Similarly, the 2021 Latinobarómetro revealed that trust in Latin
American governments fell from 46% in 2010 to 27% in 2020, while trust
in political parties dropped from 24% in 2013 to 13% in the last year.
This may be because citizens perceive ruling elites as elitist in nature
and indifferent to their social needs and interests. Moreover, the
inequality generated by economic globalization---driven by neoliberal
ideology---has left many workers in Western countries, especially in the
United States, frustrated with their precarious working
conditions. [These elements
converge](https://dobetter.esade.edu/en/political-equality-democracy) to
boost the political influence of far-right and populist parties in the
West, as portions of the population increasingly turn to these parties
in the hope they will address their concerns and improve their lives. 

A fourth factor worth highlighting is [the rise of Donald Trump to power
in the United States]{.underline}, as the former president displayed
hostility toward the liberal order. With his slogan \"Make America Great
Again\" and [the policies he implemented in
trade](https://dobetter.esade.edu/en/trump-trade-us-eu) and immigration,
[he demonstrated an anti-globalist, nationalist, populist, and
ultimately illiberal stance]{.underline}. For example, [his proposal to
increase
tariffs](https://dobetter.esade.edu/en/trump-economy-stagflation)---and
in some cases actually doing so---has affected many of the country\'s
trading partners and Western allies. For Trump, defending American
interests requires limiting and reversing the integration process of
economic globalization, underpinned by neoliberal ideology, especially
because he believes that some countries have benefited from it at the
expense of the United States. He insists that the US has been harmed by
this process, as evidenced by significant trade deficits with several
countries, including China. Furthermore, he considers it crucial for
American multinational companies to return to the US to help create jobs
and ensure that their profits are reinvested domestically. This is just
one indication that he is unwilling to continue supporting the liberal
international order that the US once promoted, because he believes it
harms the country. 

While the factors mentioned above help explain the narrative surrounding
the crisis of the liberal order, it is important to highlight that this
crisis has also triggered [a crisis in liberal
democracies](https://dobetter.esade.edu/en/live-democratic-world). This
can be attributed to economic inequality and the widespread loss of
trust in public institutions' ability to meet citizens' needs, as
previously mentioned. But that is not all: party systems are evolving
with the emergence of populist and radical parties, which have increased
their presence in Europe. At the very least, the retreat of liberal
democracies is evident in Western Europe. Cases such as Hungary and
Poland clearly illustrate this trend, as does the growing influence of
the far right in countries like France. 

Democracy is undergoing a process of deconsolidation characterized by
growing voter indifference

One explanatory factor that accompanies the rise of these populist
parties is affective polarization. This fosters the alignment of
partisan identities with other social identities, such as racial or
territorial ones, and heightens the perception of ideological distance
between political parties ([Rogowski and Sutherland,
2016](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-015-9323-7); [Webster
and Abramowitz,
2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1532673X17703132); [West
and Iyengar,
2022](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-020-09637-y)).
Comparative and experimental studies show a relationship
between [ideological and affective
polarization](https://dobetter.esade.edu/en/rationality-political-opinions-polarized):
as political parties grow more ideologically distant from one another,
voters also drift apart and become more willing to express hostility
toward those they consider ideological opponents (Rogowski and
Sutherland, 2016; Webster and Abramowitz, 2017). This helps explain the
emergence of populist parties, whose political agendas often lie at
opposite extremes of the ideological spectrum, thereby exacerbating
divisions within society and undermining liberal democracy. This
fragmentation hinders deliberative processes needed to reach broadly
accepted solutions. Hence, democracy appears to be undergoing a process
of deconsolidation marked by increasing voter indifference and,
consequently, a partial failure of liberal democracy ([Kundnani,
2020](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/03/future-democracy-europe)). 

Therefore, [if social order is essential for a stable social life, we
must recognize that the social actors involved---in this case,
nation-states---must safeguard its preservation.]{.underline} This means
not only ensuring the legitimacy of the participants, but also providing
material benefits so that the order can endure. In this sense, we can
say that there are groups or parties within Western powers that no
longer support maintaining the liberal order because traditional parties
have failed to improve the material conditions of their societies, which
face increasing economic inequality and job insecurity. In addition,
[the decline in Western influence and coercive power is making it harder
to uphold the liberal order over time. ]{.underline}

Indeed, we can assume that [contradictions within liberal societies and
the nation-state itself are paving the way for authoritarian
leaders and, consequently, eroding the legitimacy of the liberal
international order.]{.underline} This brings us to the final question:
how deep is the crisis of this order? I believe [it is not only a crisis
of US hegemonic leadership, but a broader crisis of an
order]{.underline} that increasingly fails to inspire enthusiasm in
other parts of the world. In fact, it is leading to growing
disillusionment with the liberal international order, which stems from
its inability to convince citizens that it can provide the well-being
they demand. Moreover, it is contributing to a reconfiguration of power
marked by weak governance coalitions and institutions. 

Finally, I believe [this order will only become more stable and
legitimate if it gives voice to developing countries in order to build
stronger governance.]{.underline} At the same time, it must promote
economic development that meets social needs and helps build robust
institutions---both locally and globally---where civil society actively
participates in political decision-making on [pressing issues like
climate change](https://dobetter.esade.edu/en/climate-change-systemic).
This would not only ensure a more democratic and socially legitimate
decision-making process, but also greater social acceptance, as the
order would be centered on social well-being. If Western powers,
especially the United States, want to preserve the liberal international
order, they must take these factors into account. 

#### Revitalizing US [hegemony]{.underline} and [commitment]{.underline} to norms is [key]{.underline} to support the [Global South]{.underline} and the LIO [broadly]{.underline}\-\--assumes Trump [decline]{.underline}. 

**Castañeda 2/4** \[Jorge Castañeda Gutman is a Mexican politician and
academic who served as Secretary of Foreign Affairs. "American
Leadership Is Good for the Global South."

//aka

The return of Donald Trump to the White House has been cast by many
observers as the end of an era. The U.S.-led order, variously described
as the rules-based order or the liberal international order, which rose
to its feet after World War II and strode triumphantly around the world
after the end of the Cold War, is no more. Indeed, U.S. Secretary of
State Marco Rubio described that order as "obsolete" during his
confirmation hearings in January. A stark vision of the world has
emerged in its absence: one in which national interest alone governs
international relations, transaction is the name of the game, and might
makes right.

For many in the developing world, the death of the U.S.-led order seems
nothing to mourn. After all, as these countries often point out, the
liberal international order was frequently not liberal, international,
or ordered. It also struggled to include non-Western countries in
meaningful ways. The governments of so-called middle powers, such as
Brazil and India, have long complained that global institutions and
structures remain disproportionately aligned with the interests of
wealthy countries to the detriment of all others.

[The global South is an amorphous and much-debated
category]{.underline}, encompassing a very broad range of countries.
Simply put, it describes the vast majority of the world's people, living
in countries that were by and large once colonized in Africa, Asia, the
Middle East, and Latin America. Some observers add China to the mix---in
the United Nations, China is listed as a member of the G-77, the
coalition of developing countries---but its inclusion is confusing. [The
world's main manufacturing economy can hardly be considered a developing
country, even if Beijing insists to the contrary. But what seems to
unite this enormous grouping of states is a shared dissatisfaction with
the international order as it exists.]{.underline}

One way global South countries want to change that order is by reforming
multilateral institutions, such as the UN Security Council, the World
Bank, and the International Monetary Fund, to make them more
representative. That effort faces serious headwinds and seems unlikely
to yield meaningful results in the near future. But these countries have
also signaled an interest in replacing the dollar as a reserve currency
and an instrument for trade. [And wittingly or not, they are carrying
China's water by supporting its positions on contentious issues related
to the environment, human rights, and democratic governance. In an era
of great-power competition, **such advocacy from the global South risks
playing into Beijing's hands, abetting China's rise and speeding the
United States' decline.**]{.underline}

[**This is a misguided, contradictory, and unnecessary effort.** Instead
of seeking a new international order, the global South should try to
make the **current one work**---even as the new occupant of the White
House seems ready to jettison international norms. Indeed, Trump's
reelection makes such a focus **more urgent,**]{.underline} even if the
global South can't expect great results while he is in office. [The
rules-based order may have been riddled with inconsistencies, but **at
least it had rules**, especially in the form of international treaties
aimed at **securing the common good.**]{.underline} It is in the
interests of the global South to uphold and strengthen these treaties.
[The current international order needs **much greater commitment** from
the United States; the world does not require less American involvement,
but rather a good deal more.]{.underline}

[A world regulated and organized around clear, well-defined, and
rigorous laws that are respected by all, especially by the most powerful
and wealthy, is **much to the advantage** of the globe's poorer
countries.]{.underline} [Whether it be on trade, human rights, women's
rights, the environment, disarmament, labor, or mining on land or in the
sea, international law often favors weak, poor, and small countries.
Turning away from the U.S.-led order and bolstering China would **do
little to protect international law**. Indeed, it would invite the
**steady erosion** of what has been the world's most successful legal
regime and leave the global South vulnerable to a more dangerous law
altogether: the law of the jungle.]{.underline}

AN INCOMPLETE ORDER

It is abundantly clear that the United States has retreated from the
order it built after World War II, a move that will likely only gain
speed under Trump. The United Nations remains the paradigmatic
institution of that order and a key place for the global South to
advance its interests. Trump's decision to appoint the combative
Republican lawmaker Elise Stefanik as his UN ambassador suggests that
the president wants to take an adversarial stance toward the
organization. But even before Trump's reelection, the United States had
been systematically reducing its participation in the UN, UN agencies,
and other multilateral institutions.

The United States has once again exited the World Health Organization
after initially leaving the institution during Trump's first term. In
the past, U.S. governments have withdrawn from and suspended dues
payments to UNESCO, the UN's cultural body. Prior administrations have
repeatedly refused to acknowledge the jurisdiction of the International
Court of Justice and insisted that they cannot comply with the court's
rulings. The United States withdrew from the International Labor
Organization in the 1970s and has ratified only 14 of its 189
conventions. Trump has again left the Paris climate accord after
initially pulling the country out during his first term.

On global trade and other economic matters, the United States has
recklessly undermined the system it built. Trump's tariff wars with both
longtime partners and adversaries are only the latest example of a
growing tendency to turn away from free trade. Take, for example, U.S.
neglect of the World Trade Organization. Since 2017, Washington has not
appointed panel members to the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism,
paralyzing a body that is supposed to iron out disagreements over global
trade. This practice began during Trump's first term but continued
during the Biden administration and will likely remain an obstacle with
Trump back in the White House.

The United States is not contemplating withdrawing from the
International Monetary Fund or the World Bank, but it has made reforming
them exceedingly difficult. It took Congress five years to approve the
last reform of IMF voting rights and quotas in 2010, when the fund
approved a six percent shift in quota shares to underrepresented IMF
members. Since 2010, further reform has proved nearly impossible. Much
as reform of the UN Security Council remains stalled, so, too, does
reform of the IMF and the World Bank---institutions long dominated by
the West. Both organizations seem unlikely to cede much weight to global
South countries. And it's highly doubtful that the new Trump
administration will want to expend any kind of political capital further
opening these institutions.

**[The world does not require less American involvement, but rather a
good deal more.]{.underline}**

This neglect of its role in major organizations is less significant than
how the United States has failed to uphold international law. U.S.
lawmakers have habitually refused to ratify the treaties advanced by
presidents and other U.S. politicians. The list begins with the League
of Nations, which was approved in 1919 by all the participants at the
Versailles Conference, including U.S. President Woodrow Wilson. The
Senate rejected it the next year and the United States never joined the
League, the first in what would become a long sequence of international
agreements that Washington either signed but did not ratify, signed and
then withdrew from, or never signed in the first place.

More recently, the United States has failed to ratify the Arms Trade
Treaty, which seeks to control the trade in conventional weapons and
entered into force in 2014, as well as the multilateral trade agreement
known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which the United States signed
in 2016 but never ratified and from which Trump would eventually
withdraw. Domestic opposition has also proved an insurmountable barrier
to ratifying climate treaties, such as the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, making
implausible an overarching climate compact---that is why the 2015 Paris
climate accord was simply an accord, not an "agreement."

U.S. lawmakers have resisted ratification of major treaties for several
reasons. These include concerns about compromising national sovereignty,
upsetting the American system of federalism that leaves certain matters
to the states, and duplicating existing domestic legislation. That
reluctance to commit to treaties has no doubt undermined the
construction of a credible international order. Take, for instance, the
International Criminal Court. In 2000, U.S. President Bill Clinton
signed the Rome Statute that created the court; it was never ratified,
and his successor, President George W. Bush, removed the U.S. signature,
making the emergence of a far-reaching and capable ICC practically
impossible. To be sure, in some cases, Washington abides by the
provisions of these treaties even if it hasn't ratified them, including
the Arms Trade Treaty. That might be better than not observing these
treaties, but it always begged the question of how the United States
could criticize other non-ratifiers for violating the articles of a
given convention if it had not ratified the convention itself. It also
made the United States into something of a free rider: Washington
enjoyed the benefits of a system of international rules without assuming
any responsibility for supporting or enforcing them.

Consider the American Convention on Human Rights, adopted by many
countries in the Western Hemisphere in 1969 and signed but not ratified
by the United States. The U.S. failure to ratify this treaty has
inevitably weakened the defense of human rights in Latin America,
allowing dictatorships and democratic backsliders greater impunity. Such
instruments are especially needed now, when human rights are threatened
in many parts of the hemisphere, including in the United States.

[For countries in the global South, this American disinterest in the
preservation of the postwar order U.S. leaders helped build is **only
bad news.**]{.underline} [It is in the interests of poorer and less
powerful countries to have a firm structure of international law
mediating the conduct of states.]{.underline} Take, for instance, the
1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which set up the International
Seabed Authority headquartered in Jamaica. The United States never
signed this convention. Poorer coastal countries lack the technology and
capital to scoop up manganese nodules and other crucial minerals that
lie on the sea floor. Rich countries have both the technology and the
funds. Unlike the Arms Trade Treaty, the United States does not abide by
many of the provisions of UNCLOS, particularly regarding seabed mining.
An international ocean regime that regulates mining and the exploitation
of the seabed and encourages the sharing of its resources is far better
for the global South than a free-for-all in which anything goes.

FINISH THE JOB

It might be impossible to reform the Security Council, the IMF, the
World Bank, and other fixtures of the current international order. But
convincing the United States to sign and ratify this panoply of
international instruments might be plausible. Washington has either
failed to ratify or chosen to withdraw from nearly 50 major treaties.
Under Trump and with the resurgence of isolationism among
Republicans---and with treaty ratification requiring two-thirds support
in the Senate---their formal approval seems a very distant prospect.

[That should not stop global South countries from trying to pressure the
United States to renovate the house it built. They can play a
**constructive role** in encouraging the United States to better uphold
the rules-based order. They are quick to condemn Washington for its
hypocrisy, but they don't do anything to persuade the United States to
better adhere to the rules that define the U.S.-led order itself.
Instead, they should use a commonplace method in Washington to change
opinions and facilitate legislation: lobbying.]{.underline}

Americans, and Republican legislators especially, tend to dislike the
meddling of foreigners in their affairs. But many countries have begun
taking their cases to Washington to shape bilateral relations. China,
India, the Gulf states, and the larger European countries all hire
expensive and highly reputed lobbying and white-shoe law firms to
advance their interests in Congress. Canada has done so on a large
scale, on everything from dairy products to lumber, fishing, and border
regulations. Mexico lobbied U.S. legislators intensely and successfully
in 1993 to win passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement. In
principle, such practices could extend to persuading the United States
to ratify international agreements. Countries that are not aligned with
China, such as Brazil, India, Mexico, Nigeria, and South Africa, could
take the lead in this effort, striving to convince U.S. lawmakers that
they should help complete, rather than unwind, the rules-based order.
Such ratifications would win Washington a great deal of goodwill in the
global South---and undermine Beijing.

This would not be a short-term task; it would take a decade at least and
require navigating the complexities of the Trump administration and
subsequent dispensations. But with skill and sufficient resources and
patience, such an effort could produce meaningful results. [The global
South should make clear to the United States that the only way it can
weather the Chinese (and Russian) challenge is through alliances and
partnerships that reach beyond the traditional West. One of the best
ways to build and consolidate those ties is by ensuring respect for
international law.]{.underline}

[A global South with a more universalist and constructive agenda could
make a real difference. Its leading countries, through their growing
size, wealth, and prestige, could help build a world order that is not
only more just but more codified, regulated, and respectful of
international law. The law can be a tremendous instrument for reducing
inequality within countries; so, too, can it achieve the same result
among countries. A world of treaties and international law will be far
better than one without them.]{.underline}

The [NATO summi]{.underline}t held two weeks ago in The Hague [delivered
on the low expectations the allies had set for it]{.underline}. Amid
fears that U.S. President Donald Trump would blow up a normal agenda,
NATO leaders significantly pared back the program, taking hard
discussions on issues such as support for Ukraine, NATO's relations with
Russia, and Russian hybrid attacks in Europe off the table. But the
[summit]{.underline} did c[lose with a historic agreement by most
allies,]{.underline} Spain being a notable exception, [to increase
members' defense spending to five percent of GDP over the next ten
years,]{.underline} with 3.5 percent earmarked for core military
spending and 1.5 percent for hardening civilian infrastructure and
overall resilience. The pledge to spend more on defense, in addition to
NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte's sycophantic praise of Trump at the
summit, smoothed the way for Trump to stick largely to the summit's
highly choreographed script, keeping the alliance's cohesion intact.
Trump even appeared to leave The Hague with a newfound appreciation for
NATO members, telling reporters: "These people really love their
countries. It's not a rip-off, and we're here to help them."

[Any sense of relief among the allies, however, may be
short-lived.]{.underline} The relatively positive headlines coming out
of the summit obscure the storm brewing across the Atlantic. [The [Trump
administration](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/topics/trump-administration) is
undertakin]{.underline}g [a]{.underline} sweeping force posture review
slated for release in late summer or early fall that could fundamentally
reshape the U.S. military's global footprint. If that process results in
a [significant and swift reduction of U.S. forces in
Europe]{.underline}, an outcome that administration officials have
publicly suggested is possible, [the alliance will become more
vulnerable to further Russian aggression.]{.underline}

[Europe is stepping up]{.underline} in a big way, and defense budgets
are rising, [but it will take time to ramp up production and deliver the
capabilities that the United States currently provides on the
continent.]{.underline} [The [United
States](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/regions/united-states)]{.underline} [may]{.underline}
see fit [to make some]{.underline} force [adjustments in
Europe]{.underline} that allow it to bolster its defense posture in Asia
[to counter rising threats from China.]{.underline} But Washington must
carefully plan any such shift, leaving U.S. forces in place long enough
that Europeans can work to fill the coming gaps and retain their
credible deterrent against Russia[. It is critical that any drawdown be
closely coordinated with NATO military authorities and that allies agree
in advance to cover lost capabilities. Otherwise, Russian President
Vladimir Putin will be tempted to take advantage of a weakened
alliance.]{.underline}

**WORDS OF DISCOURAGEMENT**

The political signals surrounding the [U.S. Defense
Department's]{.underline} force posture review have [only increased
European allies' fears that a rapid drawdown is coming]{.underline}. In
a speech at his
first [NATO](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/topics/nato) defense
ministers meeting in February, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth
underscored the Trump administration's view that Europe could no longer
be a U.S. priority, saying that given the "strategic realities,"
European NATO leaders "should take primary responsibility for defense of
the continent." Those comments contrasted sharply with the message
Hegseth delivered in Singapore in May, when he underscored the U.S.
commitment to the Indo-Pacific and called it the United States'
"priority theater." Media coverage of the Pentagon's 2025 Interim
National Defense Strategic Guidance---issued this spring as a
placeholder for the National Defense Strategy, which is expected to be
released late this year---suggests that the department intends to fund a
military buildup in the Indo-Pacific by diverting resources from other
places, including Europe, and accepting greater risk in those areas.
Even Matthew Whitaker, [the U.S. ambassador to NATO, said in May that
Washington was "not going to have any more patience" when it came to
reducing the U.S. presence in Europe.]{.underline}

The Trump administration's attitude
toward [Russia](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/regions/russia) is also
feeding NATO allies' concerns about the U.S. commitment to Europe. Trump
has been reluctant to define Russia as a threat, instead calling Putin a
"good guy" and making clear his aim to normalize U.S. relations with
Moscow. Senior U.S. officials have also downplayed Putin's risk to
Europe. Steve Witkoff, Trump's special envoy for the Middle East, who
also oversees diplomacy with Moscow, said in an interview with the
conservative broadcaster Tucker Carlson in March that it was
"preposterous" to think that Russia would "march across Europe"---a
straw-man argument meant to suggest that European assessments of the
Russian threat are overblown. NATO allies had planned to present a
Russia strategy for approval at the June summit but suspended it in fear
that they could not get Trump on board.

Even if Moscow does not march across Europe, [Russia will pose a threat
to NATO. The Russian military, although not without its flaws, is no
longer the disorganized force it was just over three years
ago,]{.underline} when it launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Since February 2022, Putin has transformed Russia's economy and military
to support prolonged confrontation. [Russian defense spending in 2025
amounts to 7.7 percent of GDP, a 12 percent increase from
2024]{.underline}. Moscow's defense industrial base is running at full
capacity. As Rutte said at Chatham House in June, "The facts are clearly
there that Russia is able, within five years, to mount a credible attack
against NATO territory." Multiple European intelligence agencies have
arrived at similar conclusions. [Washington can ill afford to rapidly
reduce its presence in Europe just as Russia is gearing up for further
aggression.]{.underline}

**THESE THINGS TAKE TIME**

[NATO has been overly dependent on the United States for its military
capabilities since the alliance's founding]{.underline}, in 1949. After
the [Cold War](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/tags/cold-war), when most
European militaries substantially cut their defense budgets, this
dependence only deepened. The United States also lowered its defense
expenditures and reduced its forces in Europe, from about 300,000 during
the Cold War to about 100,000 troops today (including 20,000 additional
forces Washington deployed in 2022 in the wake of Russia's invasion of
Ukraine). But despite this decrease in manpower, U.S. capabilities have
remained key to NATO's posture, plans, command and control, and force
models. Today, the [U.S. Army supplements NATO forces along the
alliance's frontier with Russia]{.underline} in the Baltics and Romania,
and it maintains permanent bases in Germany and Poland. The U.S.
military also stores equipment, its Army Prepositioned Stocks, in
Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Poland to outfit army
reinforcements that arrive by air. [The U.S. Navy has six Aegis-class
destroyers]{.underline} deployed at a U.S. base in Rota, Spain, to
support NATO's missile defense and take on other maritime tasks in
European waters, such as maritime patrols in the Baltic Sea. The [U.S.
Air Force has combat and support squadrons stationed at allied bases
across NATO territor]{.underline}y, from the Incirlik Air Base in Turkey
to those in Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the Azores.

Should U.S. military capabilities be removed from NATO defense plans[,
Europe would be unable to quickly fill the resulting gaps, creating
vulnerabilities that Putin would be tempted to exploit. U.S.
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platforms, for example,
are essential for NATO's awareness of Russian activity.]{.underline}
Their withdrawal would leave the alliance especially vulnerable to
Russian hybrid attacks, such as undersea cable sabotage, jamming, or
cyberattacks. Fewer such resources would also limit early warnings about
incoming attacks and hinder NATO's ability to select, prioritize, and
engage Russian targets in the event of conflict. The personnel that
process, analyze, and fuse this intelligence---many of them
American---are too specialized to replace quickly and often in short
supply.

Europe also remains highly reliant on U.S. air-to-air refueling tankers,
heavy lift aircraft, and other such "strategic enablers" to move forces
across the continent and supply it with battlefield intelligence.
Despite European allies' progress on procuring the military equipment
needed to meet their newly mandated responsibilities in NATO planning,
they have made less headway in developing these particular capabilities
at scale. NATO would therefore struggle to move troops and equipment
quickly across Europe in a crisis, just as it did after Russia's
full-scale invasion of Ukraine, when some allies relied on the United
States to transfer their troops to eastern Europe to reinforce the
eastern flank. With a pared-down U.S. presence, critical shortfalls of
air and missile defenses would also become even more acute, leaving
allied forces and countries that are within striking distance of Russian
missiles and drones particularly vulnerable.

Other essential capabilities---long-range precision missile systems such
as HIMARS, stockpiles of precision-guided munitions, and advanced
drones---could also be diminished by a premature U.S. withdrawal. One of
NATO's key deterrents against Russia is its credible ability to target
high-value assets within the country. Losing stocks of long-range
missiles would significantly erode this deterrence and increase Europe's
vulnerability in the event of a Russian attack. And these capability
gaps do not exist in isolation. The United States provides European
militaries with most of their sustainment units, including medical and
logistics personnel and a large share of specialists in cyber, space,
and electronic warfare. [Even as European countries ramp up defense
spending, the timelines for assuming the functions the United States
fills today will stretch into the next decade.]{.underline}

**A MOST DANGEROUS GAME**

The Kremlin would likely see a rapid U.S. drawdown in Europe as a golden
opportunity. [Moscow has long sought to undermine NATO, seeing its
demise as a critical step toward reasserting Russia's position as a
global power.]{.underline} Most immediately, the Kremlin would seize on
any U.S. retreat to amplify Europeans' anxiety that Washington is
abandoning them. [With Europe feeling vulnerable, Moscow would ratchet
up its coercive tactics to intimidate European publics and pressure
their governments to be more accommodating to Moscow]{.underline}.

As Russia perceived gaps in NATO's conventional forces, Moscow would
probably become more willing to take risks to advance its aims. Putin
would assume that with a smaller U.S. presence in Europe, the West would
be forced to favor de-escalation, creating an environment the Kremlin
would view as exceptionally permissive and paving the way for
increasingly brazen acts. Moreover, Russia has long viewed Europeans as
supplicants of Washington, unable to function effectively without U.S.
direction. If the United States goes forward with a rapid reduction in
forces, Moscow might judge that European unity would collapse, fueling
Putin's propensity to overestimate Russia's ability to achieve its
goals.

Any sense of relief among NATO allies may be short-lived.

[Most
immediately, [Putin](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/tags/vladimir-putin) would
look to further scale up gray-zone activities in Europe, such as cable
cutting and other forms of sabotage.]{.underline} With fewer U.S.
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets in place, such
acts would be harder for European countries to detect or attribute,
allowing Moscow to operate with greater impunity. Beyond hybrid attacks,
Russia could be tempted to take limited military action. Because a
reduction in U.S. assets in Europe would lead to slower NATO response
times, [Putin might have greater confidence that Moscow could
successfully seize territory, for example in a Baltic state or in
Svalbard, a strategic Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic]{.underline},
[and then use coercion and nuclear threats to compel NATO to accept the
result.]{.underline} With air and missile defense in short supply and
long-range missiles withdrawn, NATO could find it challenging to mount
an immediate and coordinated defense---undermining NATO's credibility
and dramatically altering the European security order.

Russia is not going away, and Europe's buildup will take time. If the
United States does plan to reduce its troop deployment in Europe, simply
notifying the alliance that such a change is underway will be woefully
insufficient to ensure NATO's continued ability to protect its members.
To avoid a dramatic blow to the alliance's defenses, allies must procure
today what they will need to quickly fill the gaps tomorrow. NATO
military authorities must be given time to review and update their
battle plans, and individual countries with the means to do so must
commit to replicating specific capabilities that that will be lost as
the United States pivots.

Pulling back as Russia is ramping up its military capacity and before
Europe is ready to defend itself would embolden the Kremlin and raise
the risk of another war---this time on Trump's watch. [The best way to
prevent a future war in Europe is to make sure Moscow never dares to
start one. And that will require Washington and its European partners to
design a careful and coordinated handoff.]{.underline} The United States
must tell its partners exactly where any new gaps will be---long before
they appear.

New York: [History shows that end of an empire means collapse of
imperial rules and their enforcement. **Anarchy, warlordism, loot, and
collapse of governance and prosperity follow**]{.underline} - until a
new hegemon arrives. William Dalrymple\'s 2019 book, The Anarchy, is,
among other things, a good account of India\'s tribulations between end
of the Mughal empire and formal establishment of British rule.

The word \'empire\' is tainted today by the memory of colonialism. But
historians like Charles Tilly have highlighted the key role of empires
through history in creating settled conditions and rules that created
economic and physical security, key conditions for rising prosperity.
Economic historian Deepak Lal made the same point in his 2004 book, In
Praise of Empires, without exonerating colonial excesses.

[Today, we\'re witnessing the end of American hegemony and its
rules.]{.underline} Twist in the tale: the end this time is being driven
not by a rival conqueror, but by the hegemon itself, in search of
supposed reciprocity. This bodes ill for coming decades ahead. [The
unprecedented prosperity created by **Pax Americana** after WW2 looks
certain to diminish, and local hostilities (like the latest Israel-Iran
escalation) to expand, hitting security, investment, trade, GDP and
social indicators.]{.underline}

Indian foreign policy has long sought multipolarity, to give New Delhi
more flexibility in foreign policy. Trump\'s actions point in that
direction. Alas, what India is gaining through flexibility is far less
than what it is losing through a flawed but very useful post-WW2
rules-based system. [The US created this system to help itself, of
course. But, in the process, it had created international public goods
of **unprecedented importance.**]{.underline} Those public goods are now
eroding. Trump\'s gyrations are the beginning of the end of economic
rules established in the last 75 years.

[Pax Americana did not imply a formal American empire. Unlike earlier
hegemons, **the US did not conquer, or formally rule over what it called
the \'free world\'.**]{.underline} But, along with allies, [it
established a new set of global rules under UN and international
institutions such as World Bank, IMF and Gatt.]{.underline} The Marshall
Plan - called \'the most unsordid act in history\' by Winston
Churchill - carried conditions along with free billions to Europe, such
as economic opening up and a sustained move to globalisation. This
created the most phenomenal improvement in the history of GDP as well as
social indicators, human rights and democratic institutions.

[Pax Americana was far from an era of total peace. Small wars galore
occurred, but **no clash of titans.** Conditions were peaceful enough
for unprecedented harmonisation of rules in trade, investment, shipping,
aviation, telecom, finance, and much else.]{.underline}

The US dominated the post-WW2 world economy. It could afford both
charity and a long view of its interests. [It visualised globalisation
through rules as both **moral and economic imperatives.** Starting rich,
the US lowered its economic barriers more than others in negotiations in
Gatt and other fora. It offered developing countries \'special and
differential\' treatment to help them along. This supplemented **foreign
aid.**]{.underline} The US aimed to gain not by growing its own slice of
the global pie, but by increasing the size of the pie, so that all
allies and objects of charity in **[the Third World prospered
too.]{.underline}**

[It succeeded beyond all expectations.]{.underline} Historian Angus
Maddison has given estimates of per-capita incomes since 1 AD in 1992
dollar terms. In 1 AD, per-capita income was \$450 in India and China,
and \$400 in North America. Pax Romana under the Roman Empire gave Italy
double the living standard of any other place at \$809. This earlier
hegemon also gained hugely along with ruled colonies through a
rules-based system and relative - by no means absolute - peace.

Economic progress was slow before the Industrial Revolution. In 1700 AD,
per-capita income was just \$550 in India, \$600 in China, \$527 in the
yet-to-be-created US, and \$997 in Western Europe. [But in only 53 years
between 1950 and 2003, it **skyrocketed everywhere** - from \$619 to
\$2,160 in India; from \$448 to \$4,803 in China; from \$9,561 to
\$29,037 in the US. The international public goods provided by the US
were a key reason.]{.underline}

The other big player in this period was the USSR. This was a Russian
empire parading as a \'people\'s republic\'. It had an internal empire
consisting of central Asia and Caucasian provinces, along with conquered
countries of Eastern Europe at the end of WW2. The USSR, too, had a set
of institutional rules that benefited its own empire for some decades.
Indeed, in 1950, many analysts expected communist hegemony to triumph
over capitalist nations. This looked plausible when the USSR became the
first to launch Sputniks and men in space. [But superiority of
US-promoted institutions soon became apparent. And the rest is
history.]{.underline}

[Empires don\'t end overnight. They erode gradually. But **the end of
Pax Americana and rise of multipolarity looks like making the world
nastier, more conflict-ridden place with less economic progress, and
less camaraderie.**]{.underline}

[The second strand argues that America is a liberal hegemon---a
democracy promoting, rules-based order maintaining, global
power.]{.underline} While the liberals have traditionally found it
difficult to reconcile the 'existence of public goods putatively
supplied by hegemons', the recent scholarly efforts have sought to
develop arguments around American leader-ship and liberal order (Deudney
and Ikenberry 1999). [John Ikenberry (2011, 2--3)explains liberal
hegemony as 'a distinctive type of liberal international order---a
liberal hegemonic order. The United States did not encourage open and
rules-based order. It became the hegemonic organiser and manager of that
order'.]{.underline} According to Ikenberry(2002), [the US foreign
policy is one of 'liberal hegemony'. This argument suggests that the

others while promoting Western liberal values, including constitutional
democracy, the rule of law, economic freedom, individual rights and

orders']{.underline} (Coyne and Blanco 2016).The third strand of the
hegemony debate seeks to integrate the often-neglected idea-tional
aspects into the foundation of the American hegemonic order. Inderjeet
Parmar(2018), for instance, argued that [underneath all the material
capabilities of the United States lies the 'ideational-infrastructural'

An American return to a balance of power approach in the Middle East
should not be misunderstood as the end of American hegemony---we are
still very much in an era where American power and American policies
will shape the world in which we will live.

[But the failures of the past few years, most notably in Iraq, have
generated a new tendency within American society in favor of
disengagement from global affairs. There has always been a strand within
American public opinion that favored isolationism -- unfortunately that
strand is gaining strength today as some Americans conclude that, if
American hegemony does not make our success inevitable, it is better for
us not to try to have an influence, but merely to protect our homeland
and let others go their own way.]{.underline} It is this tendency that
has given strength to calls by some members of Congress for an immediate
withdrawal from Iraq.

[This is a dangerous tendency, but it is also one that, in the end, is
unlikely to prevail---**because isolation is not a viable way of
protecting American interests and because inaction does not absolve one
of responsibility**; it is also a policy choice with real
consequences.]{.underline} [Because of America's huge consumption of
fossil fuels, **a choice by the US to disengage from debates over global
warming also has an impact**. Because of the power of the US economy,
**American trading practices will affect the world whether or not the US
is committed to the World Trade Organization (WTO).** A]{.underline}nd
because of the strategic cooperation between Arab governments and the
US, a choice by the US not to press for political and economic
liberalization in the Arab world also affects Arab lives and affects the
ability of radicals who advocate violence to win new recruits who might
one day attack Americans.

[Precisely because America's economic and military power remains
unmatched by any other global actor, America cannot disengage from the
world and certainly not from the Middle East]{.underline}. [While
America is not all-powerful it remains, as former Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright used to say, the "indispensable" nation. So
ultimately the question for the US is not whether to engage the world,
or the Middle East, but in what way and to what ends.]{.underline}

In the case of the post-9/11 United States, we find an understandable
(if seriously flawed) incentive for a unipole to act as a revisionist
power in a region populated by minor powers, not potential global
challengers. Adding in the 9/11 factor to the already existing incentive
of securing oil production and transit, we have an excellent explanation
for the American wars against Iraq in 1990-91 and 2003 and against
Afghanistan in 2001. The American intervention in Libya in 2011, and its
general (if brief) support for regime change elsewhere in the region
during the Arab Spring, requires an explanation that combines unipolar
hubris with the democracy promotion tradition in American foreign
policy. One can argue that the Bush 41 Administration's conduct of the
Gulf War in 1990-91 was an effort to restore a regional status-quo, not
revise it. While true, that does not detract from the fact that such a
large American military effort against a Soviet treaty ally would have
been, if not unthinkable, at least highly unlikely during the Cold War.

[In all of these cases the structural condition of unipolarity provides
the opportunity for the United States to use force in the Middle East, a
region in which during the Cold War its military interventions were
infrequent and limited (1958 Lebanon; 1987-88 naval intervention in the
Persian Gulf). Presumably, a true regional hegemon would not have to
engage in so many military interventions to get its way, yet American
military actions in the Middle East greatly increased during the period
of its putative hegemony. Moreover, a real regional hegemon would have
been more successful in its interventions to change the status quo, as
its legitimating ideas would have found much more support in the
countries where the hegemon was seeking to revise the domestic
status-quo in recalcitrant regional states.]{.underline}

[Maintaining the United States' position as the world's premier military
force will push the defense budget beyond the trillion-dollar
mark.]{.underline} To [ensure the long-term sustainability of the
world's most advanced military while maintaining readiness and
effectiveness, the US must rethink its approach]{.underline} to defense
funding. Prioritizing the right investments in new capabilities, while
leveraging advanced technologies to enhance existing systems, can reduce
costs and preserve a decisive edge. [This approach strengthens
deterrence and ensures the US can rapidly dominate any conflict,
regardless of the operational environment.]{.underline}

Shifting to upgrading existing airframes with advanced technology rather
than developing entirely new 6th-generation aircraft could offer
significant long-term benefits. [This approach results in substantial
cost savings by avoiding the massive research and development expenses
associated with new platforms while leveraging existing maintenance
infrastructure]{.underline}. Additionally, integrating advanced
technologies into proven airframes allows for faster deployment,
reducing development cycles from decades to just a few years.
[Reliability would also improve]{.underline}, as these upgraded aircraft
are built on battle-tested designs, avoiding the risks of unproven
platforms and costly performance shortfalls.

Another key advantage is the ability to adopt modular and
open-architecture upgrades, which enable [rapid integration of
artificial intelligence (AI), sensor fusion, hypersonic weapons, and
advanced stealth coatings without requiring entirely new aircraft
designs]{.underline}. This incremental [innovation approach ensures
continuous modernization without the financial and operational burdens
of a generational shift.]{.underline} Furthermore, sustaining production
of existing airframes stabilizes the industrial base and supply chain,
preserving skilled labor and reducing reliance on experimental
manufacturing techniques. However, this approach does come with
trade-offs.

While upgraded airframes can incorporate many next-generation
technologies, they may struggle to compete with emerging peer threats,
such as China's J-20B and a future J-31, which are designed from the
ground up with advanced stealth and next-generation propulsion. Despite
these limitations, prioritizing enhancements to proven aircraft, while
strategically investing in select next-generation platforms, could
provide a cost-effective, lower-risk approach to maintaining American
air superiority in the evolving global security landscape.

For example,
the [estimated](https://breakingdefense.com/2023/10/newest-f-35-f-15ex-contracts-are-set-but-how-much-do-they-cost-exclusive/) cost
per F-15EX Eagle II is \$87.9 million per unit. However, the total
procurement cost, including development, support, and spares, can push
the price per aircraft to around \$117 million. At first glance, this
makes the F-15EX slightly more expensive than the F-35A (\$82.5 million)
but cheaper in terms of long-term sustainment and operational costs, as
it leverages existing F-15 infrastructure.

[Leveraging emerging technology to enhance existing military
capabilities is a cost-effective strategy for extending platform
lifecycles,]{.underline} [improving combat effectiveness, and increasing
survivability.]{.underline} AI and autonomy integration, such as AI
copilots for fighter jets and swarm unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV),
enhance decision-making and reduce risks for human operators. Upgrading
legacy aircraft and naval platforms with hypersonic weapons
significantly expands strike ranges and lethality, while applying
stealth coatings and advanced electronic warfare systems enhances
survivability by reducing detectability and countering modern threats.
Cybersecurity and network-centric warfare advancements, including
real-time data-sharing and AI-driven analysis, improve battlefield
coordination across multiple domains, ensuring more effective mission
execution.

Meanwhile, [integrating directed-energy weapons, such as high-energy
lasers on ships and vehicles, provides cost-effective, high-precision
air and missile defense without expending traditional
munitions]{.underline}. Ground combat platforms, including M1A2 Abrams
tanks and infantry systems, are also benefiting from active protection
systems and AI-powered targeting, significantly improving survivability
and lethality. In space and intelligence, reconnaissance satellites with
AI-driven threat detection and persistent intelligence, surveillance,
and reconnaissance (ISR) drones ensure superior situational awareness.
By applying AI, hypersonics, stealth, electronic warfare, and directed
energy to proven platforms, the US can modernize its forces without the
extreme costs and risks of developing entirely new systems, ensuring
long-term military superiority while maintaining fiscal responsibility.

[This strategy allows the United States to maintain its military
superiority over China's rapidly expanding and modernizing forces by
prioritizing technological advancements over costly new platform
development]{.underline}. By integrating AI, hypersonics, stealth,
electronic warfare, and directed energy into existing platforms, the US
can rapidly upgrade combat capabilities without the lengthy and
expensive process of designing entirely new aircraft, ships, and ground
systems. [This ensures that American forces remain combat-ready and
adaptable while China continues to build up its military
infrastructure.]{.underline}

One key advantage is speed and efficiency---modernizing proven platforms
allows the US to deploy cutting-edge technologies much faster than
China, which is still refining its next-generation aircraft, naval
forces, and missile systems. Upgrading legacy airframes like the F-15EX
and B-52J with hypersonic weapons, enhancing stealth with
radar-absorbent materials, and improving real-time battlefield awareness
with AI-driven sensor fusion ensure that American forces can strike
faster, detect threats sooner, and operate with superior coordination.

Additionally, network-centric warfare improvements, such as [joint
all-domain command and control]{.underline}
([JADC2](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF11493)) and real-time
data-sharing, [enhance multi-domain operations, allowing the US to
maintain an intelligence and decision-making advantage over China's
military.]{.underline}

Survivability is another critical factor. By integrating active
protection systems into tanks, directed-energy weapons into naval ships,
and AI-driven electronic warfare suites into aircraft, US forces can
better counter China's advanced missile threats, cyber warfare tactics,
and mass drone swarms. Additionally, maintaining a robust industrial
base through upgrades to existing platforms ensures that production
remains scalable and sustainable, unlike China's military, which relies
heavily on state-controlled production with limited battlefield testing
of new systems.

By leveraging emerging technologies in a modular, cost-effective manner,
the US can remain ahead of [China's growing
military](https://www.cfr.org/blog/six-takeaways-pentagons-report-chinas-military) without
the financial and operational burdens of continuously developing
entirely new systems. **[This strategy ensures that American forces
remain agile, lethal, and technologically superior, capable of deterring
war and, if necessary, achieving decisive victories in any operational
environment.]{.underline}**

Given these disputes about how to measure polarity, it is [perhaps
**unsurprising** that there is no **consensus** on the question of
whether the world is **headed** toward a period of bipolarity or
**multipolarity** --- or whether it will remain a **unipolar** system
**dominated** by the United States]{.underline}. Disparities between
economic and military indicators [**complicate** the picture, and
policymakers tend to rely on their **favorite** metrics for political
purposes]{.underline}. Arguments about polarity today cluster around
three hypotheses:

[The world is **headed** for a new bipolar **Cold** War]{.underline}. As
academic Oystein Tunsjo argues, "No other states are within reach of the
United States and China . . . within the foreseeable future, and no
third state will be capable of developing a combined capability
comparable to either."16 [A **growing** focus on the **military** is
typical of such **arguments**. China has clearly matched **American**
economic power and is an integral part of critical global supply chains;
**proponents** argue that China's military has now **grown** to match,
to the point that it could **compete** with the United States in a
direct **conflict**]{.underline}. There is still disagreement about
whether that bipolarity is global or regional. The case is far stronger
for bipolarity in the Indo-Pacific, although most would accept that
China is in the process of transitioning from its position as a regional
power to becoming a global one. Proponents of this viewpoint often focus
heavily on the Cold War and look for ways in which a US-China
competition might compare or contrast with the long-running US-Soviet
rivalry.

[The world is **slowly** evolving into **multipolarity**. As political
scientist Barry Posen puts it, "It **seems** **plausible** . . . that a
prolonged period of multipolarity will occur before **bipolarity**
reemerges]{.underline}, if indeed it ever does."17 Instead of
emphasizing military factors, [**those** who believe that the **world**
is headed for multipolarity tend to focus on **economic**, social, and
political **considerations**. China and the United States are the
**largest** economies in the world, but **economic** power has become
**diffuse** in the last seven decades]{.underline}. Owing to its
importance to global trade networks, the EU has significant regulatory
power over trade and technical standards worldwide. [The East Asian
**democracies**, and, increasingly the developing world, are also
**major** players in a globalized **economy**. Military strength remains

proven how difficult it can be to employ military coercion to achieve
**policy** successes]{.underline}.18 The failure of the United States to
leverage its grandiose military to defeat far smaller opponents in

believe that China is not a **superpower**]{.underline}: It has no
comparable alliance network to that of the United States and has
significant internal weaknesses, with increasing indications of a
stagnating economy.20 As Europe and other traditional U.S. allies are
unlikely or incapable of working with China, they would argue, the
unipolar nature of the international system is likely to persist.

LF

The expectations for the second Trump administration vary considerably.
Trump's first term and the compelling nature of international
constraints suggest a degree of continuity. [The US will hardly
disengage unilaterally from strategic competition with Russia and
China.]{.underline} However, this time around, the president and his
supporters are well-prepared. The "Make America Great Again" (MAGA)
movement has matured ideologically, and the president had personnel
proposals and executive orders ready on day one. Traditional
conservative internationalists will certainly have less of a say in the
next four years. Without such forces of continuity softening the edges
of K 80 G. Groitl a MAGA foreign policy, the level of uncertainty and
the disruptive potential of the second Trump presidency are
unprecedented in modern history. Will we see the end of the liberal
West? Will Trump abandon European NATO allies? Will he sacrifice
Ukrainian sovereignty to end the war? Or will Trump eventually be
frustrated with Putin and increase support for Kyiv? Will he crack down
on Chinese ambitions in Asia and beyond? Or will his anti-globalist,
non-interventionist, and autocratic instincts preordain a great power
bargain at the expense of allies? This incredible spectrum of
possibilities is a hallmark feature of the Trump presidency, not least
because the president considers unpredictability a strength.

[However, there is a glimmer of hope amidst the
uncertainty.]{.underline} **[The good news is that Trump has two
qualities that can be assets in periods of strategic upheaval: He has an
uncompromising desire to win and is willing to challenge the status quo
for it.]{.underline}** If Russia and China gain power and influence, the
US loses. [Zero-sum game thinking and an instinct for power will hardly
let the new president give Russia and China a free pass.]{.underline}
Pair this with his willingness to question established policies and it
may indeed add up to an opportunity. The fact of the matter is that
liberal internationalism and the so-called liberal international order
have been overtaken by events. [However, Western policy still clings to
empty phrases of a bygone era. Though it may be hard to see, **the
second Trump administration could inspire---even force---the West to
rethink its strategic vision for a realistic international order of the
21st century.**]{.underline}

[Since the administration is very conscious of America's power and
status, it is more likely than not that the US will continue to stand up
to Russia and China.]{.underline} Trump has repeatedly made clear that
he opposes the continuation of military and other aid to Kyiv, that he
wants a quick ceasefire and does not consider the fate of Ukraine a
priority. [However, the doomsday scenario of an American abandonment of
Europe and Ukraine appeared unlikely in early 2025,]{.underline} at
least at first. The new administration seemed to search for a way to
freeze the conflict, enlist European powers to police a ceasefire and
free up American attention for China. How much pressure the Trump
administration will place on Russia is the crucial question, and a
sell-out of Ukraine would be the worst-case scenario. [Despite the many
risks associated with America's changing posture, the truth is that the
status quo was unsustainable.]{.underline} Western support and resolve
have been insufficient to put Kyiv in a position of strength. In fact,
Ukraine is slowly but surely losing on the battlefield. [The course
emerging in Washington may hold promise as long as the desired ceasefire
is neither an end in itself nor mistaken as the end of the
story]{.underline}. After all, Russia's ultimate goals have not changed:
to destroy Ukraine as an independent nation and state and to revise
Europe's regional order. China policy is expected to become more
combative under Trump, and the new administration will have to avoid the
trap of overdoing it. Many in Washington mistakenly believe that the US
can and must focus almost exclusively on China and the Indo-Pacific. [Of
course, the prerequisite is that regional allies uphold a favorable
balance of power elsewhere, which would certainly require continued US
enabling support.]{.underline} If the US wants to stand up to China,
there is a compelling national security imperative to remain engaged in
Europe. Yet considering the transatlantic rift exposed at the 2025
Munich Security Conference, severe doubts are in order.

\"It\'s very hard to know what\'s coming from day to day,\" she argues.
\"And that has always been Trump\'s approach.\"

[Trump successfully harnessed his reputation for volatility to change
the trans-Atlantic defence relationship. And apparently to keep Trump on
side, some European leaders have flattered and fawned.]{.underline}

[Last month\'s Nato summit in The Hague was an exercise in obsequious
courtship. Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte had earlier sent President
Trump (or \"Dear Donald\") a text message, which Trump
leaked.]{.underline}

\"Congratulations and thank you for your decisive action in Iran, it was
truly extraordinary,\" he wrote.

[On the forthcoming announcement that all Nato members had agreed to
increase defence spending to 5% of GDP, he continued: \"You will achieve

**[For bluffs to achieve their goal of coercion, a leader must maintain

[\"Even seemingly **empty threats can effectively achieve their
strategic objectives** if they intimidate adversaries or bolster support
within their constituencies,\" Akcinaroglu told DW.]{.underline}

[Nuclear deterrence is a key example --- the threat of launching nuclear
strikes and a willingness for mutually assured destruction (ironically
called MAD for short) has achieved its purpose in preventing
thermonuclear war, so far.]{.underline} \"But it's difficult to
determine the sincerity or credibility of bluffs when US presidents use
them,\" Akcinaroglu argued.

Cultivating uncertainty is a key tactic of MAD. Richard Nixon coined the
term \"madman theory\" to describe his belief that creating the
perception of mental instability could contribute to victory in Vietnam.

\"[The madman theory is the idea that it is helpful to be viewed as
crazy in coercive bargaining. This is particularly useful when following
through on threats is very costly,]{.underline}\" said Roseanne McManus,
a political scientist at Pennsylvania State University, US.

\"\[But\] it is very difficult to tell the difference between genuine
madness and credible bluffing,\" McManus told DW.

[Trump is a \'madman\' with adversaries and allies]{.underline}

Every US administration since the Cold War has bluffed and threatened
warfare --- nuclear or conventional --- to serve their strategic
purposes, even if the goal is peace.

Research in political science has suggested that for 80 years, Russia
has believed the US stands behinds such threats of war, especially if
any other NATO member country is invaded.

Where Trump\'s madman strategy differs to past US presidents, however,
is that he uses it on adversaries as well as allies, said McManus.

\"Since beginning his second term, Trump seems to be seeking to
accommodate Russia rather than using a madman strategy toward Russia.
Trump may instead be using a madman strategy toward Europe,\" said
McManus.

His threats to pull out of the NATO alliance come with an additional,
veiled threat that he might not defend Europe against future Russian
attacks. But it remains unclear what his ultimate intentions are. The
uncertainty embedded in his otherwise familiar rhetoric is what makes it
hard for other countries to know where they stand with Trump.

[Trump could be playing a multi-dimensional mind game.]{.underline}

Europeans rally around Ukraine after Trump row

What can the madman theory tell us about Trump?

The short answer is that it tells us nothing --- but that is the point.

\"[Trump is clearly aware of his madness reputation and **views it as an
asset**.]{.underline} Nonetheless, it is often unclear to me whether
Trump is deliberately employing the madman theory or just acting on his
genuine impulses,\" McManus said.

McManus\' research suggests leaders who never follow through on their
threats will tend to lose their madness reputations.

\"**[If Trump follows through even some of the time on extreme threats,
like he recently did with trade tariffs, he can probably maintain his
madness reputation]{.underline}**,\" said McManus.

And perhaps that is Trump's biggest gamble: Playing madman with all
sides in his diplomacy hinges on whether he can keep it up. Meanwhile,
he leaves everyone guessing.

LF

The administration announced a few trade frameworks with the United
Kingdom and Vietnam, but Trump ran out of patience. He's sent letters to
two dozen nations and the European Union informing them of their tariff
rates, such as 30% against the EU and Mexico, potentially undercutting
the work of his own negotiators.

Desai said Trump's approach has generated "overwhelming interest" from
other countries in reaching trade deals and gives the U.S. leverage in
negotiations.

John C. Brown, a professor emeritus of economics at Clark University in
Massachusetts, said the "willy-nilly setting of tariffs according to one
person's whims has no precedence in the history of trade policy since
the 17th century."

"It's just bizarre," Brown said of Trump's moves. "No one has done this
in history."

The president has also used the threat of tariffs in an attempt to help
political allies and influence other countries' court systems. He told
Brazil that he would implement a 50% tariff if the country didn't drop
its prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who like Trump was
charged with trying to overturn an election.

I mean, Vladimir [Putin]{.underline} has shown an unwillingness to work

So these investments are important. [It\'s in naval vessels and ships,

investment here in the Golden Dome, which will help us have real

As Congress launches into debate over [President Donald Trump's budget
reconciliation package]{.underline} -- what he has dubbed the "One Big,
Beautiful Bill" -- much of the conversation has centered on government
spending cuts and tax priorities. While those are indeed important
aspects of this legislation, [the bill]{.underline} also [contains
crucial measures to fully fund the military and invest in our national
security.]{.underline}

That's why, as a retired Air Force colonel and staunch advocate for
military readiness as a deterrent to conflict, I'm throwing my full
support behind the Big Beautiful Bill. President **[Trump's approach is
not just a numbers game -- it's a strategic vision that prioritizes
America's security, restores military readiness, and does so without
breaking the bank.]{.underline}**

The Big Beautiful Bill includes [\$150 billion in additional mandatory
military spending]{.underline}, [reflecting this president's commitment
to rebuilding a military that has been stretched thin by decades of
overuse and underfunding.]{.underline} This money is a critical
supplement to the \$892.6 billion President Trump has already requested
in his [2026 defense budget
proposal](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Fiscal-Year-2026-Discretionary-Budget-Request.pdf).

Taken together, Trump is calling for total defense spending for fiscal
year 2026 of approximately \$1.04 trillion, a slight but targeted
increase from prior years.

Importantly, however, the breakdown of how the Big Beautiful Bill
allocates **[this extra defense funding shows that President Trump and
Republicans aren't just throwing money at the Pentagon and hoping for
the best. Instead, they are addressing glaring gaps in our defense
infrastructure and investing in military technologies of the
future.]{.underline}**

The \$150 billion in the Big Beautiful Bill specifically includes \$25
billion for President Trump's proposed "Golden Dome for America," a
revolutionary missile defense shield modeled after Israel's Iron Dome;
\$21 billion to restock the nation's depleted ammunition arsenal; and
\$9 billion for service member quality-of-life issues like housing and
healthcare.

[The reconciliation package also includes \$34 billion to build more
ships and bolster America's naval might]{.underline}. As
I've [written](https://amac.us/newsline/society/americas-maritime-crisis-a-call-for-urgent-revival/) previously,
the [decline of U.S. maritime power is a serious crisis that needs
addressing.]{.underline} **[Communist China has been building ships at a
breakneck pace in recent years. This money will help ensure that the
United States remains the dominant global power at sea.]{.underline}**

The Big Beautiful Bill also ties defense spending to broader fiscal
responsibility by including measures to claw back unspent funds from
bloated domestic programs and redirect them to the military. This is a
masterstroke -- balancing a strong defense with the kind of fiscal
discipline conservatives like me have long demanded.

Critics might cry about "cuts," but reallocating wasted or misspent
resources to protect our homeland isn't a cut; it's common sense.
National security does not exist in a vacuum. We have a responsibility
to find a way to bolster our military might without piling on debt.

Another crucial element on this front is fixing longstanding procurement
issues, another priority addressed in the Big Beautiful Bill. [Every
taxpayer dollar spent on the military should go toward ensuring our
warfighters have the best, most cutting-edge equipment in the world
--]{.underline} and that they and their families are taken care of. As
someone who's seen firsthand how red tape can hamstring readiness, I
applaud this focus on getting the most bang for our buck.

The corporate media has predictably nitpicked President Trump's defense
agenda. A
recent *Politico *[piece](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/national-security-daily/2025/05/05/making-sense-of-trumps-defense-spending-math-00329045) is
indicative of the criticism, with the so-called "experts" questioning
whether Trump can meet his ambitious spending goal of three percent of
GDP on defense while keeping overall spending in check. I get the
concern, but the doubters are missing the point. Trump's plan isn't
about endless blank checks; it's about leveraging America's economic
strength to fund what matters most.

Moreover, by slashing wasteful programs and boosting economic growth
through deregulation and energy independence, Trump creates the fiscal
space for a robust defense budget. The Congressional Budget Office
projects GDP growth of 2.8 percent in 2026 under current policies.
Trump's pro-growth agenda could push that even higher, making three
percent of GDP more than achievable.

**[This increased investment couldn't come soon enough. China's military
buildup, Russia's aggression, and Iran's proxies aren't slowing down.
Our adversaries don't care about Washington's budget squabbles --
they're watching our resolve.]{.underline}**

[Trump's plan sends a clear message: America is back, and we're not
messing around.]{.underline} The 2026 [budget's focus on naval
expansion, including new Virginia-class submarines and unmanned systems,
directly counters China's growing Pacific presence]{.underline}.
Investments in cyber warfare and space capabilities show Trump
understands the 21st-century battlefield. **[Trump is committed to
dominating the domains where future wars will be won or
lost.]{.underline}**

The naysayers -- mostly establishment types and left-leaning pundits --
will argue Trump's plan is "too aggressive" or "unrealistic." But
they're the same folks who cheered endless wars in the Middle East while
letting our military atrophy.

Trump's approach of peace through strength is different. **[A
well-funded, modernized military deters conflict, saving precious
American blood and treasure in the long run.]{.underline}**

As a veteran, I've seen what happens when we shortchange defense --
overworked troops, outdated equipment, and a weakened posture that
emboldens our enemies. [Trump's 2026 defense budget, paired with the
reconciliation bill's fiscal guardrails, is a blueprint for reversing
that decline.]{.underline} It's bold, it's necessary, and it's rooted in
a clear-eyed view of the world.

[President Trump isn't just funding a military. He's funding America's
future as the world's unrivaled superpower]{.underline}. Count me in.

"Congratulations and keep up the great work!" they wrote on X.

**Enlistment Downturn**

[The recruitment surge follows two consecutive years of missing
recruitment targets, marking a significant turnaround for the US
Army.]{.underline}

In 2022, the service was 15,000 soldiers short of its target, recruiting
only 45,000 new soldiers instead of the intended 60,000.

The following year, the army's goal was 65,000 recruits, but it fell
short again, enlisting only 55,000.

[The two-year shortfall was attributed to a tight labor market due to
the lingering effects of the coronavirus pandemic]{.underline}, as well
as "low trust" among Gen Z toward the military.

As a result, the US military entered 2024 with its [smallest active-duty
force](https://thedefensepost.com/2023/12/20/us-army-recruits-woes/) in

said Maj. Christopher Robinson, a spokesman for Training and Doctrine
Command.]{.underline}

[The Army expects to have 25,000 soldiers in the Delayed Entry Program
when the 2026 fiscal year begins, Driscoll said.]{.underline}

[Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George noted that the "most productive"
recruiting months of the fiscal year are still ahead.]{.underline} He
added that the Army is trying to make improvements to technology for
recruiters and reducing how many forms recruits have to fill out while
in-processing.

"It was something like 670 forms that had to be filled out and we've
reduced that to below 10, and it's now going to be in a database,"
George said.

[The last time the Army hit its annual recruiting goal in the first week
of June was back in 2014, Lt. Col. Jeff Tolbert, a spokesman for
Driscoll, said in a news release.]{.underline}

The Defense Department's "Rapid Response" X account posted a Fox News
story about the Army's recent recruiting success along with a quote:
"They call it the TRUMP-BUMP."

However, the rebound in Army recruiting began before President Donald
Trump was elected in November. The service met its fiscal year 2024 goal
of 55,000 new soldiers a month before the election after missing its
recruiting target for the previous two years. The Army also announced in
October that it would increase this fiscal year's recruiting target by
6,000 soldiers.

Currently, there is not enough data to either prove or disprove that
more Americans are joining the Army as a result of Trump's reelection,
said Katherine Kuzminski, director of the Military, Veterans, and
Society Program at the Center for a New American Security think tank in
Washington, D.C.

"We began to see the turnaround in Army recruiting beginning last August
as a result of efforts put into place in 2022-2023," Kuzminski told Task
& Purpose on Wednesday. "The Future Soldier Prep Course played (and
continues to play) a large role in that success --- yielding 25% of last
year's recruits and keeping up the momentum into this administration."

[**A major factor that is driving the Army's recent recruiting success
is the Future Soldier Preparatory Course**, Kuzminski said. About 13,200
recruits joined the Army through the course in fiscal year
2024.]{.underline}

[**The Army has also taken steps to professionalize its recruiters**,
and the service's "Be All You Can Be" recruiting campaign may have
appealed to parents and other adults who can influence whether young
Americans join the military, she said.]{.underline}

[**Despite** exceeding 100% of GDP, US public debt is considered
**safe** due to the country's role as a **safe global asset** and
**reserve currency supplier**]{.underline}. This column uses a model to
quantify the additional debt capacity generated by this 'exorbitant
privilege' status. It finds that [the **special status** of the US
**increases** maximal sustainable debt by around **22%** of GDP, mostly
due to debt being **liquid** and widely used as
**collateral**]{.underline}. Overall, [the US's status in **global
financial markets** is crucial for **debt sustainability**]{.underline},
and efforts by other countries to establish competing safe assets could
pose challenges to the US's dominant position.

However, [a **deeper look** at the U.S. fiscal situation reveals a
**less gloomy** picture. True, debt (a **stock** variable) relative to
GDP (a **flow** variable) has **surged** in the past decade. But
relative to net national **wealth** (a **stock** variable) -- a more
**apples-to-apples** comparison -- public debt has actually **fallen**.
Growth in the economy's capital stock has **outpaced** public borrowing
**since 2011**]{.underline}.

[The U.S. also faces **less binding fiscal constraints** than other
countries. While the supply of debt is crucial, so is the demand for it.
As the supplier of the **global reserve currency** and **perceived safe
assets**, the U.S. enjoys **higher demand** for its liabilities than
other countries]{.underline}.

Moreover, [the U.S. **tax burden** -- around 30% of GDP -- is **low**
compared with other countries and its own history]{.underline} (see
Figure 4). [This means the U.S. is **unlikely** to hit **upper-bound
constraints** on taxation]{.underline} (in economic jargon: "Laffer
Curve constraints"). [Contrast this with many **European countries**,
where the tax burden is **much higher** and, in some cases, at
**multidecade highs**, leaving **less room** to adjust taxes in response
to **fiscal needs**]{.underline}.

[Investors are therefore likely to grant more **fiscal credibility** to
the U.S. than other countries. To some extent, this is **nothing new**:

## Transition

### Transition\-\--US Key\-\--2AC/1AR

#### US key to maintaining heg

**Gökçe '25** (Yasir Gökçe, Dr Yasir Gökce is the director of the
Institute for Diplomacy and Economy (instituDE), PhD from Bucerius Law

LF

This stance has reinforced concerns about yet another contradiction in
U.S. foreign policy. While Washington has framed its support for Ukraine
against Russian aggression as a defense of sovereignty, human rights,
and the rules-based order, it has refused to apply the same principles
to Gaza. This double standard has deeply damaged U.S. credibility,
particularly in the Global South, where accusations of selective
morality and Western hypocrisy are growing louder. Many argue that the
U.S. is not merely eroding the legitimacy of the LIO but actively
accelerating its decline by demonstrating that international rules apply
only when they align with American interests.

[The liberal international order is far from perfect, but it remains the
best framework for addressing global challenges. If the U.S. continues
to undermine it, the world risks descending into a fragmented, lawless
order where might makes right. The choice is clear: **the U.S. can
either lead by example, embracing the rules it helped create, or watch
as the order it built crumbles under the weight of its own
contradictions**.]{.underline} Given the Trump administration's choices,
practices, and statements---along with Trump's disregard for
international law and principles and his belief in a Hobbesian
world---it is unrealistic to expect such leadership from the U.S. at
this time.

The writer is the author, most recently, of 'Homelands: A Personal
History of Europe'

A poem bequeathed us by the epically gloomy Canadian seer-singer Leonard
Cohen ends with the words: "oh and one more thing / you aren't going to
like / what comes after / America".

As we pass the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war in
Europe, [every day brings further evidence that a remarkably long-lived
US-led international order is over. Everyone is now scrambling to
**work** out what might succeed it.]{.underline} A new multi-polar
order? Spheres of influence? A worldwide version of the 19th-century
Concert of Europe? [By far the [most plausible answer,]{.mark} however,
[is a prolonged and dangerous period of **global
disorder.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Of course there never was a golden age of universal liberal
international order. But across large areas of the world, in Europe,
Asia and Oceania, [there was a security and economic order led by the
"liberal]{.mark} [leviathan",]{.mark} as the Princeton scholar John
Ikenberry dubbed the post-1945 US.]{.underline} This order, which
reached its zenith at the beginning of this century, has been declining
for some time, partly because of the "rise of the rest", itself
facilitated by US-led globalisation, and partly due to America's own
hubristic self-harming.

President Donald Trump is now tearing down what remains of the edifice
with unparalleled speed and recklessness. Even in the unlikely event
that American democracy emerges unscathed from four years of Trumpian
revolution, so far as relations between the US and its allies are
concerned it will be "never glad confident morning again" (to quote
Robert Browning's The Lost Leader).

[With [three or potentially]{.mark} even [four significant wars]{.mark}
now [raging (Ukraine, Gaza, Sudan]{.mark}, nuclear-armed [India and
Pakistan]{.mark} facing off over Kashmir) and trade-stopping three-digit
tariffs between the world's two largest economies, who can doubt that
[**we're currently in a period of dangerous disorder**? Some]{.mark}
still [hope]{.mark} that [we will emerge from it]{.mark} fairly soon,
either [by a **miraculous restoration of the former**]{.mark}
**[order]{.mark}**]{.underline} or by the creation of a new one.
**[Well, let's hope]{.underline}**, but here are several good reasons to
doubt it.

Even if a rising superpower (China) and a relatively declining
superpower (the US) are not fated to fall into the "Thucydides trap" and
go to war, [periods of [great power]{.mark} [shifts]{.mark} almost
invariably [bring **increased international
tensions.**]{.mark}]{.underline} The leaders of China and Russia have
just marked the end of the European part of the second world war by
meeting in Moscow to reaffirm their partnership against the west. Xi
Jinping even equates the "arrogant fascist forces" defeated in 1945 with
today's "unilateralism, hegemony and bullying". (Guess whose?) Russia
now has a war economy and Vladimir Putin is bent on restoring as much as
he can of the Russian empire. Narendra Modi's India has its own
nationalist ambitions and an obsessive enmity towards Chinese-backed
Pakistan.

Beside these rivalrous great powers, there's an array of middle powers
such as Turkey, Brazil and South Africa. Strikingly, these countries
often see opportunities in the new disorder. They can align with one
great power for one purpose, another for another, all the time advancing
their own goals. [Meanwhile, small states like those in the Gulf can
play with and between all the big powers, like the Egyptian plover bird
which flourishes by cleaning the detritus between crocodiles'
teeth.]{.underline}

For 80 years since nuclear weapons were dropped on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, the taboo on their use has held. [But as the world watches a
major war being waged by a nuclear-armed Russia against Ukraine, a
country that voluntarily gave up its Soviet-era nuclear weapons in 1994
in return for security assurances from the US, UK and (blackest comedy)
Russia, **the [fragile dam against]{.mark} nuclear
[prolif]{.mark}eration seems [likely to burst.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

South Korea, agonising over what Russia has promised North Korea in
return for substantial military support against Ukraine, has an active
debate about acquiring nuclear weapons --- and the technology to do it.
[The subject is on many minds in the [Middle East,]{.mark} as that
region [teeters between]{.mark} a [nuclear]{.mark}-armed [Israel and a
nuclear-threshold Iran,]{.mark} while Europeans are beginning to feel
they need their own nuclear umbrella.]{.underline}

[Meanwhile, a [continued tech]{.mark}nological [revolution generates new
dimensions]{.mark} of geopolitical rivalry, including [control over
data, software and communication]{.mark} networks. **[AI]{.mark}, in
particular, [brings]{.mark} the danger of a [new arms race]{.mark}**[,
more unpredictable than]{.mark} the [cold war]{.mark}'s nuclear one. If
China can surprise the US with a DeepSeek, why could it not secretly
develop a DeepStrike? Continued [population growth]{.mark} [and climate
change will exacerbate competition for resources and]{.mark} pressures
for mass [migration.]{.mark}]{.underline}

To be sure, there are countervailing forces. China has an obvious
economic interest in preserving an open world trading system from which
it has been the biggest single beneficiary. Even the most opportunistic
middle powers must fear disorder becoming total breakdown. There are
encouraging signs of a liberal fightback in Canada, Australia and
Europe. Pope Leo XIV promises to "build bridges" on a troubled earth.

Nothing in history is inevitable. Yet those of us who believe in the
never fully realisable ideal of liberal international order will be well
advised to assume that the melancholy Cohen was right. **[We should
actively prepare for a [protracted period of global
disorder.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### Transition\-\--AT: Multipolarity\-\--2AC/1AR

#### [Multipolarity]{.underline} is the [squo]{.underline} and it [fails]{.underline}\-\--[hegemony]{.underline} is [key]{.underline} to solve geopolitical issues\-\--else, retrenchment.

[The 61st Munich Security Conference revealed that the [**global**
system]{.mark} has been [**evolving** toward]{.mark}
**[multipolarity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Today, we live in a transitory
period. In other words, [the **[world]{.mark}** is in [undeclared
**chaos**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The United Nations system has collapsed, especially after the crime of
genocide committed by Israel in partnership with the Western global
powers. There is no norm, rule and principle that Israel and its
accomplices have not violated since Oct. 7, 2023. The U.N. and other
global institutions were otherized and even demonized by the Western
countries due to their call on the Israeli government to end its
atrocities in Gaza and the international community to take necessary
measures against Israel. The Munich Security Report 2025 analyzes the
current process of multi-polarization in the world. The report argues
that the view that the world is multilateral is debatable and claims
that the world system is transforming toward multipolarity.

[On the one hand, [more]{.mark} and more [**rising** powers]{.mark} can
now **[influence]{.mark}** key [global **issues**]{.mark}. On the other
hand, the **[increasing]{.mark}** polarization has been preventing the
development of [common **approaches**]{.mark} to global
[crises]{.mark}]{.underline}. It has been [[challenging]{.mark} to
[reach]{.mark} a **[consensus]{.mark}** over most international
**[issues]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Nowadays, the world is divided along
different lines, namely, [the [distribution]{.mark} of
**[power]{.mark}** and ideological **[polarization]{.mark}**. Even the
Western [alliance]{.mark} is now **[divided]{.mark}** between [the
U.S]{.mark}. and **[Europe]{.mark}**. After the rise of
ultra-[nationalism]{.mark} and far-[rightist]{.mark} political parties,
[liberal]{.mark} values were largely [sidelined]{.mark} by the Western
**[governments]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Political or economic liberalism
is not the main tenet of Western countries anymore. It seems that the
current [multi-[polarization]{.mark} process will not **[end]{.mark}**
with more inclusive **[global]{.mark}** governance but with a renewed
**[global power rivalry]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The current process
[increases the [risk]{.mark} of [global **disorder**]{.mark} and
undermines [**multilateral** cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Similarly, U.S. officials [perceive **[multipolarity]{.mark}** as a
strategic [threat]{.mark} to American [national interests]{.mark} since
it attempts to [impose **constraints**]{.mark} on [U.S.
policies]{.mark}]{.underline}. The reelection of President Donald Trump
and the explanations of his Cabinet members show that liberal
institutionalism is not the grand strategy of the U.S. anymore. [The
[Trump **administration** rejects]{.mark} the U.S.-[created]{.mark}
international order and [**global** values]{.mark} overall. The U.S.
faces a [dilemma]{.mark}. On the one **hand**, it does [not]{.mark}
[want]{.mark} to [continue]{.mark} to be the main [security
**provider**]{.mark} for the [European continent]{.mark}]{.underline}.
On the other hand, the [[U.S.]{.mark} will be **[alienated]{.mark}**
from its [close allies]{.mark} and [partners]{.mark} due to the
**[unilateral]{.mark}** and **[interventionist]{.mark}**
[policies]{.mark} of the [**Trump** administration]{.mark}. The
trans-Atlantic alliance will soon face the biggest challenge in its
history]{.underline}.

For instance, [JD [Vance]{.mark} severely **[criticized]{.mark}** the
[European]{.mark} countries, blaming them for [**not** being]{.mark}
[**democratic** enough]{.mark}]{.underline}. He warned Europe by saying
that the greatest threat [[facing]{.mark} the **[continent]{.mark}** is
from **[within]{.mark}**]{.underline}, not from Russia and China. The
future of the alliance largely depends on the European reaction to
unilateral and interventionist policies. If the European global powers
decide to increase their strategic autonomy, they will have to differ
from the U.S. Europe and the European Union are at a crossroads: whether
to become an independent political and military pole in the world system
or to remain dependent on the U.S. security umbrella. The problem is
[Europe is also [**internally** divided]{.mark}, and it has to employ
[new **mechanisms**]{.mark} in the near [future]{.mark}. For instance,
it may [improve]{.mark} closer [relations]{.mark} with Türkiye and other
regional and [global **actors**]{.mark}]{.underline}. China and Russia,
as well as countries in the Global South, such as India, will continue
to question the functioning of the international system. Considering the
irresponsible policies of Western global countries, the [states of the
Global **[South]{.mark}** will demand the **[reformation]{.mark}** of
the world **[system]{.mark}**. Most U.S. officials used to praise
**unipolarity** after the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, now
Americans have **turned** their backs on it]{.underline}.

For example, U.S. Secretary of State Marco [**[Rubio]{.mark}**
reluctantly [recognized]{.mark} that the [world]{.mark} is
**[multipolar]{.mark}**. He considers **[Russia]{.mark}** and
**[China]{.mark}** to be [two **rival** poles]{.mark} that are capable
of **[challenging]{.mark}** U.S. [dominance]{.mark}]{.underline}.
However, he does not believe the EU to be an independent pole. He claims
that the world will return to [**[multipolarity]{.mark}** as a
[result]{.mark} of [geopolitical **considerations**]{.mark}. In other
words, the U.S. officials indirectly declare that their
**[government]{.mark}** will [not provide]{.mark} global strategic goods
such as [**international** peace]{.mark} and
[security]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to this political perspective,
the U.S. is not responsible for resolving all global problems. It seems
that the [[U.S]{.mark}. may **[withdraw]{.mark}** from certain
[continents]{.mark} of [sub-**continents**]{.mark} and intensify its
**[efforts]{.mark}** in the [Western Hemisphere]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Considering its demands from Canada, Denmark and Panama, the U.S.
government will try to consolidate its dominance in the West, that is it
will return to the colonial Monroe Doctrine. On the other hand, the
perspectives of other global powers about multipolarity are different
from the American perspective. [Therefore, the [current
**process**]{.mark} will further [intensify the **rivalry**]{.mark}
between the [international **powers**]{.mark}. For instance, most
non-Western countries ask for **[equality]{.mark}** between
[nation-states]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Donald [Trump used to quip that he could shoot someone]{.underline} on
Fifth Avenue [and **not lose support**]{.underline}. The same might be
said of the royal palace in The Hague, where [the US president arrived
to a **hero's welcome** despite having relentlessly berated, humiliated
and questioned the utility of the]{.underline} **[N]{.underline}**orth
**[A]{.underline}**tlantic **[T]{.underline}**reaty
**[O]{.underline}**rganization [and European allies]{.underline}.

[Even as Trump was his initially **cagey self** on whether NATO
commitments still applied]{.underline}, alliance boss Mark [Rutte poured
on the charm. America's attack on Iranian nuclear sites, despite its
clear repudiation of European diplomatic efforts over the past decade,
was **praised**]{.underline} as "truly extraordinary"; a move to more
than double defense spending targets, another of Trump's obsessions, was
described as a "big success." Even Germany's Friedrich Merz has
described Israel's bombing of Iran as the necessary "dirty work" of
clipping Tehran's nuclear wings.

[This is apparently called politics --- what Europeans feel they must do
to preserve an alliance where the US accounts for **70% of
capabilities**]{.underline}. The America First rhetoric of Vice
President JD Vance in February has been politely forgotten in the face
of what seems like a flip away from the MAGA world's splendid isolation.
After all, [Trump has let bunker busters fly; he has **publicly laid
claim** to making "the world" safer; and he has displayed the kind of
**credible deterrence** Europeans crave as Russia continues to bomb
Ukraine]{.underline}. "Chapeau," as the French say. [Perhaps the
**global policeman** can be persuaded to postpone his retirement with a
barrel load of **defense spending**]{.underline}.

Yet this risks being a misreading of the memo from the Mideast.
Foreign-policy expert Steven A. Cook has suggested [Trump's **Iran**
intervention was a victory of **opportunism over ideology**]{.underline}
--- "Trump likes winners, and, well, the Israelis were kicking ass." [It
was also a victory of **unilateralism over alliances**, with Europeans
**left in the dark** and **sidelined** by the world's **most powerful
individual**]{.underline}, as French diplomat Sylvie Bermann put it. And
in terms of priority, [it also put **Iran before Russia**]{.underline}.
Bringing an aspiring regional hegemon to heel isn't a template
everywhere, as seen in Trump's subsequent "very nice" conversation with
Vladimir Putin.

It's of course tough to pin down where exactly we are between the Pax
Americana that for decades upheld a global US-led order and the MAGA
alternative that would opt for restraint and retrenchment, particularly
in Europe. Trump is neither consistent nor cautious; it may be that he
fails to achieve the de-escalation he says he wants.

But on the face of it, [there are still plenty of elements here in tune
with a **move away** from the old model of global **hegemony** and
**towards** what's been called "**offshore balancing**"]{.underline} ---
intervening only when necessary to keep aspiring hegemons contained, and
[otherwise reliant on **regional allies** to do what Merz might call the
"**dirty work**."]{.underline}

Given the lack of clarity on where US policy is really headed, [European
allies would do better to **quietly** question their **strategic
dependencies** rather than take increasingly Rutte-esque steps to keep
them going. "This is an **unhealthy relationship**]{.underline}," says
Christopher Layne, distinguished professor of international affairs at
Texas A&M University. Promising to spend 5% of gross domestic product on
defense may be a victory for Trump, but it's neither realistic for
European countries that have only just managed to reach the 2% level
after war in Ukraine nor helpful for understanding exactly where the
cash should go to fill gaps in building a credible Europe-first
deterrence. In this respect, Spain's pushback is saying the quiet bit
out loud.

[Instead of letting **Trump's baton** conduct the pace of rearmament,
it's time for Europe to discover its inner De Gaulle]{.underline} --- or
at least leaders worthy of the name. Merz and Emmanuel Macron are taking
a united stance, but this should go beyond financial commitments and
into identifying who should buy what and where in the name of common
European defense. It's also notable that there is much talk about
defense spending and very little about economic growth, which is AWOL in
Germany or France. Europe has a lot of problems, as the US frequently
likes to point out, so all the more reason the continent takes ownership
of them.

This also matters for America's allies beyond Europe. [One of the MAGA
mantras is that China is the one aspiring hegemon that the US needs to
focus on, and Asia the one region where **offshore balancing** would be
**too risky** given the threat to **Taiwan**. Yet Trump has also blown
**hot and cold** here, from recent trade talks to his latest declaration
that Beijing could **keep buying** Iranian oil. The US is also reviewing
the **AUKUS** security pact with Australia and the UK. Treaties last
while they last]{.underline}, as De Gaulle once said.
