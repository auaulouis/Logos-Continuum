Legal milestones: Significant, but fragile

[For decades, Inuit communities have warned global governments of the
existential threats that they face---threats that also have global
repercussions. For example, [**Inuit organizations play a key role in
international efforts**]{.mark} seeking [to regulate chemical
substances]{.mark}, [including]{.mark} the [**Stockholm** **and Minamata
Conventions**]{.mark}, as well as the [**Arctic Council**]{.mark} and
the [**International** **Maritime Organization**.
]{.mark}]{.underline}Thanks to their historic and contemporary efforts,
as well as the [broader [mobilization of Indigenous and allied
voices]{.mark} across the country, [we are beginning to see meaningful
shifts in]{.mark} how [laws]{.mark} are developed,]{.underline}
especially in terms of whose voices are included in decision-making
processes. [In a notable step forward, [Canada passed its first
environmental justice law]{.mark} last year. This law [provides a
crucial tool for advancing]{.mark} the [wellbeing of Arctic
communities]{.mark} by [requiring]{.mark} that [environmental decisions
made by the]{.mark} Canadian [government take into account local
realities, Indigenous knowledge and]{.mark} the [systemic
inequalities]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}that affect health, food
security and the broader human environment. Another [significant victory
for the [right to a healthy environment]{.mark} was [recently secured
through]{.mark} the [Canadian Environmental Protection Act]{.mark}. For
Arctic communities, the [recognition]{.mark} of this right [under
federal law provides]{.mark} a [critical legal foundation to demand
environmental policies]{.mark} and programs [that reflect]{.mark} their
[unique living conditions]{.mark}]{.underline}, address the persistent
pollution threatening their health and the need to protect the
ecosystems their ways of life depend on. [[Through]{.mark} this
[legislative reform]{.mark}, [the federal government has]{.mark} also
[acknowledged]{.mark} that [certain communities]{.mark}---[especially
Indigenous]{.mark}, racialized and remote ones---[are disproportionately
affected]{.mark} by environmental damage.]{.underline} While imperfect
and still insufficient, these changes to the law pave the way for a more
equitable transformation of our public policy. [**[The Arctic must be
fully included in]{.mark} -- [and benefit from]{.mark} -- this [evolving
legal landscape]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Whether in terms of plastic
pollution, chemical pollution, climate change or biodiversity loss,
Arctic communities experience a disproportionate share of the
environmental harms. **[These [legislative reforms can]{.mark} and must
[be leveraged to protect the North's]{.mark} fragile
[ecosystems]{.mark}, [uphold]{.mark} the [rights of Indigenous Peoples
and support communities]{.mark} in their fight against environmental and
climate injustice.]{.underline}**

The role of research in building justice

[[Researchers have a vital role to play]{.mark} in this
context.]{.underline} By documenting environmental inequalities,
generating localized data and centering Indigenous knowledge, [[research
conducted in true partnership]{.mark} with Indigenous communities [can
serve as a powerful catalyst for advocacy]{.mark}, policy change and
transformative action. By [drawing on new **legal frameworks**]{.mark}
such as the environmental justice law or the right to a healthy
environment, scientists **[can help shape public policy]{.mark}**,
**support [community-led advocacy and co-develop]{.mark}**
**[solutions]{.mark} grounded in the lived realities of the
North**.]{.underline}

#### Legal institutions are effective mechanisms for Indigenous rights\-\--Indigenous advocates utilize the law to create solutions for the issues that impact their communities

On the other hand, these international institutions and agreements have
power both through governing authority and as a result of their
reputation and status on the global stage and thus their policies and
attitudes still have a strong impact at national and subnational levels
through the theories of diffusion discussed earlier in this paper.
Further, the [ICC's declaration on [Inuit sovereignty in the Arctic
notes]{.mark} how [the Arctic Council and other]{.mark} regional
[institutions]{.mark} that bring together Arctic nations, other states
and organizations, and Arctic Indigenous peoples [can act as effective
mechanisms for]{.mark} international exchange and
[cooperation]{.mark}.]{.underline} Another relevant example of this
diffusion in the [[Arctic surrounds the growth]{.mark} and evolution of
impact benefit agreements ([IBAs]{.mark}) [between Indigenous
communities and]{.mark} extractive [actors]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Extractive projects are often viewed as "hyper-localized legal spaces"
because they have project-specific regulations and distinctive plans
dependent on the operation, company, and people involved.64 [There are
also [national and regional laws governing IBAs]{.mark}---found in
statutory policy, constitutions, regulatory limitations, or case
law.]{.underline}65 These agreements are also framed largely as private
agreements, although they still hold public value and are subject to
public perceptions, and this mix of public and private law and politics
contributes to legal diffusion and policy evolution.66 For example, the
[[Ekati Environmental Agreement]{.mark} is often [considered]{.mark} to
be [a foundational case]{.mark} for the growth of IBAs in Canada and
globally.]{.underline}67 The Ekati Mine began in 1997 and was Canada's
first diamond mine.68 As a result, there were few regulatory or legal
systems in place to manage the development and so the project agreement
was based on negotiations and consultation.69 [The Ekati Environmental
Agreement attempted to fill in the holes left by the relative lack of
regulatory presence and thus any obligation, expectation, or concern
that lacked another legal setting was included in the Agreement.70
Specifically, the Ekati Environmental Agreement included four Indigenous
groups as signatories to an implementation protocol which involved
creating a monitoring group to oversee the mine with their participation
and representation.]{.underline}71 The Federal Minister of Indian
Affairs set the timelines for the IBA agreements between these
Indigenous groups and the mine.72 This Agreement created a contractual
precedent for future projects in the region and set a standard for
industry negotiation and consultation, basically acting as a template
for extractive development in the Canadian Arctic.73 The Ekati agreement
and related diamond mining IBAs in the Northern Canadian region are
often heralded for these successes, yet Indigenous voices from the area
also expressed frustration over the real power and implementation of the
clauses in the agreements. For example, some have said that there is no
enforcement power because there is no government really overseeing the
project and the monitoring group acts more as an auditing or oversight
mechanism rather than being actively involved in the regulatory
process.74 Despite the shortcomings in the agreement[, Indigenous
advocacy groups [used]{.mark} the Ekati case [as a model to push for
increased consultation, negotiations, and rights]{.mark} in the
extractive process and industry actors used the Ekati case as evidence
of their ethical and responsible practices.]{.underline}75 They brought
the Ekati model to an international setting and helped popularize this
model of using IBAs to fill regulatory gaps.76 [[Since]{.mark} the
[Ekati]{.mark} case, [Indigenous advocates,]{.mark} industry actors, and
policy-makers have continued to analyze and evolve IBAs and the idea of
benefit sharing across the globe. They **[utilize legislative
processes]{.mark},** **[court systems, international
institutions]{.mark}**, like the Arctic Council, and public and economic
pressure on corporations [**to impact policy and industry**
**standards**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Some version of]{.mark} the
[IBA]{.mark} now [exists in nearly all]{.mark}, if not all, [extractive
developments on Indigenous territory]{.mark}.77' 78 [Examples of
specific mechanisms]{.mark} for supporting and enforcing IBAs in the
Arctic [include]{.mark}: **[UNDRIP]{.mark}**, the **[Arctic Council's
Offshore Oil and Gas Guidelines]{.mark}**, the [**Extractive**
**Industry Transparency Initiativ**e]{.mark}, and the [lending policies
of the]{.mark} International Monetary Fund (**[IMF]{.mark}**)
[and]{.mark} the [**World** **Bank**]{.mark} (WB) among other financial
institutions.]{.underline}79 These mechanisms include binding and
enforceable policy, like the lending and investment rules from major
banks, and declaratory recommendations that can be used in advocacy and
as political pressure.80 Despite the proliferation and diffusion of
benefit sharing and IBAs in the Arctic, there is a significant amount of
variability between agreements and processes, largely because there are
no clearly outlined universal and enforceable standards or policies in
the Arctic or globally.8 ' 81 The trend in corporate social
responsibility (CSR) and Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG)
investing mean that benefit sharing, specifically in a transnational
context, will continue, yet there remain uncertainties and major areas
for improvement in the process in order to more fully support Indigenous
rights to self-determination over land and natural resources.82 One
piece of this discussion needs to examine the most effective way to do a
cost-benefit analysis when not every factor in the equation has a
clearly identifiable and quantifiable value. In other words, the
traditional metric system for evaluating costs and benefits is
insufficient because they are values that cannot be monetized---how do
you put a cost on the spiritual and cultural value of lands to
Indigenous peoples, how do you assign a dollar amount to the concept of
generational equity? There are experts83 researching how to evaluate
ecosystem values from a holistic and progressive perspective, yet these
tools are not widely used or applied and this valuation system will need
to advance before benefit sharing and ESG/CSR are able to have a truly
meaningful role in supporting and advancing Indigenous rights. The
matters discussed in these two chapters demonstrate the conflicting
frames and perspectives on Arctic priorities and issues. They highlight
how complex the region is, particularly in regard to discussion of
natural resources and Indigenous rights. They raise important questions
that will need to be addressed in the coming decades. First, how can
Arctic resources be used and the benefits shared with minimal impact to
the lands, waters, animals, and people? Second, how can this be done
with consideration for the future---recognizing that many of these
resources are nonrenewable---and how can there be balance with renewable
energy development and support for other ecosystem services and values,
including subsistence needs and Indigenous rights to self-determination?
The great need for economic growth in much of the Arctic---in income,
jobs, infrastructure, and market diversification---further complicates
sustainable development. Even more, rapid climate change and the extreme
uncertainties associated with the warming planet also play a vital role
as people question whether any development is responsible or
sustainable, and in particular, if further fossil fuel development can
be justified. [This [balance between resource development and protection
is inherent to Arctic politics]{.mark} and is increasingly critical to
the future of the region---for the environment, people, and
politics.]{.underline} Yet, as is evidenced throughout this paper, the
debate is often controversial because there are many actors with varied
interests and everyone fears that over-prioritization of one side will
"endanger" the "continued well-being" of the Arctic.84 [As [the Arctic
grows in complexity]{.mark} and geopolitical significance, these
[tensions will rise]{.mark} and put further strain on the current
collaborative nature of Arctic affairs. We will [need to]{.mark} figure
out how to adapt and **[use]{.mark} the [legal, political, and cultural
foundations]{.mark}** []{.mark}we currently have [to create novel and
creative solutions]{.mark} to the problems facing the Arctic and the
globe.]{.underline}

#### Achieving Indigenous self-determination requires a multi-faceted approach\-\--the law is key

Pervasive throughout this entire paper is the idea that [[Indigenous
self-determination must be viewed from]{.mark} a [holistic
perspective]{.mark}---both in the rights themselves and in how they are
implemented and exercised. As a result, [**there is no single solution
or proposal that will advance Indigenous** **rights**]{.mark} to the
fullest extent or overcome all of the barriers and flaws present in the
current system]{.underline}. In order [[to promote]{.mark} Indigenous
[self-determination]{.mark} both on a regional Arctic level or an
international scale]{.underline}, I propose a combination of various
proposals and approaches based predominantly on the theory of
international diffusion and transnational flow. I see a [[need
for]{.mark} a [multi-faceted approach that utilizes]{.mark} both [hard
and soft law approaches]{.mark} and [roots in various governmental
levels]{.mark} from local and tribal municipalities to international
institutions]{.underline}. Rather than attempting to achieve a single
defined legal standard for Indigenous rights, I view [normative
development the most promising pathway forward. I think pattern
solidification and the enforcement of a framework of best practices that
allows autonomy for states and upholds Indigenous rights offers the most
potential for future success]{.underline}.

### Arctic Council Good

#### The Arctic Council is a [necessary]{.underline} forum for Indigenous [advocacy]{.underline}.

**Sámi Council '25** -- The Saami Council is a collective that promote
Sámi (Indigenous peoples) rights and interests. They collaborate with
Arctic States regarding circumpolar relations with regular contributions
to Chairmanship work plans. The Saami Council has particular interest in
environmental protection and sustainable development in the Arctic. (May

Peoples\", Arctic Council,

The category of Permanent Participants is a unique model of including
Indigenous Peoples in decision-making. It was created to provide Arctic
Indigenous Peoples with the means of active participation and full
consultation in the Council's deliberations. [[The]{.underline}
**[Arctic Council]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[is the]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**[only]{.mark}** [international body that has]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[**accredited**]{.mark} [Indigenous Peoples]{.mark} this
**[status]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In this article Permanent Participants
reflect on the importance of the Council for them -- and vice versa.

In general, [the engagement by Arctic Indigenous Peoples in the Arctic
Council is guided by the **understanding** that healthy and productive
ecosystems]{.underline}, both [on land]{.underline} and in marine
environments, [are]{.underline} [**fundamental** to]{.underline} the
**[cultures]{.underline}**, [identities]{.underline}, [and
**livelihoods**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} Arctic **[Indigenous
Peoples]{.underline}**. These cultures rely on local food sources and
traditional materials to maintain health, safety, and well-being[.
Indigenous]{.underline} [Knowledge]{.underline} [has]{.underline}
[been]{.underline} generated and [passed down for
generations]{.underline}, ensuring a balanced relationship with the
surroundings and the environment. However, climate change, pollution,
land use changes, and encroachments are altering natural landscapes and
threatening Indigenous ways of life. [The Arctic]{.underline} [Council
is **important**]{.underline}, as our [homelands and matters related to
these lands and waters]{.underline} [are on the Arctic]{.underline}
[Council agenda]{.underline}. The [**Permanent Participants** are
at]{.underline} [[the Arctic Council]{.mark} table]{.underline} [to
[address]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}**
the Arctic [[Indigenous Peoples are facing and]{.mark}
**[amplify]{.mark}** the [**voices** of **Arctic Indigenous
Peoples**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Since the first gathering of Arctic Indigenous Peoples in Copenhagen in
1973, [cooperation among]{.underline} [Indigenous Peoples across
the]{.underline} circumpolar [region]{.underline} [has evolved
significantly]{.underline}. [From]{.underline} [early
efforts]{.underline} to unify Indigenous Peoples' voices in addressing
shared concerns to achieving formal recognition in international
cooperation, the journey has been marked by both challenges and
accomplishments. At t[he heart of this progress is [the Arctic
Council]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[a]{.underline}]{.mark}n
intergovernmental **[[forum]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[provided]{.mark} [Arctic
Indigenous]{.mark} [Peoples]{.mark}]{.underline} [[with **a seat at the
table** to **shape policies**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[affecting]{.underline} [their lands,]{.underline}
[cultures]{.underline}, [and ways of life]{.underline}.

The first Arctic Indigenous Peoples' meeting in 1973 laid the foundation
for organized cooperation among [Indigenous Peoples]{.underline} across
national borders. The participants [envisioned]{.underline} [a
**collective body**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [advocate]{.underline}
for their rights and interests. [Their]{.underline} [declaration
emphasized]{.underline} [the need to protect their lands]{.underline},
[resources]{.underline}, [and cultural heritage for future
generations]{.underline}.

Indigenous Peoples' leaders at the time understood that [[environmental
protection and Indigenous
self]{.underline}-[determination]{.underline}]{.mark} [[were]{.mark}
**[inseparable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark}
realization [[would later **shape**]{.mark} the **[direction]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} **Arctic [cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[[culminating]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [Indigenous Peoples']{.mark}
**participation** in]{.underline} environmental and geopolitical
[[discussions on the]{.underline} **[global
stage]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

[[The Arctic Council]{.underline}]{.mark}, established in 1996, [built
on the foundation of the]{.underline} [Arctic Environmental
Protection]{.underline} [Strategy]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[[emerged]{.underline}]{.mark} [[as]{.mark} [the]{.mark} **[most
significant]{.mark}** [institutional]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[recognition]{.underline}]{.mark} [[of]{.mark} [Indigenous]{.mark}
Peoples **[voices]{.mark}**]{.underline} in Arctic governance. [Unlike
other intergovernmental organizations, the [Arctic Council]{.mark}
[includes]{.mark} Indigenous Peoples' Organizations as **[Permanent
Participants]{.mark}**, [granting them a **stronger
role**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[than]{.underline}]{.mark} Observer States
and **[[institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark}
unique structure [[allows]{.underline} [Indigenous
Peoples]{.underline}]{.mark} representatives [[to]{.mark}
**[influence]{.mark} [policy]{.mark}**]{.underline} recommendations
**[[directly]{.underline}]{.mark}**, even if they do not hold formal
voting rights.

At its inception, the Arctic Council included three Permanent
Participants: the Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC), the Saami Council,
and the Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North (RAIPON).
Soon after, the Aleut International Association (AIA), the Gwich'in
Council International (GCI), and the Arctic Athabaskan Council (AAC)
also joined, ensuring broader representation of Indigenous Peoples
across the Arctic region. If we hold hands, we cover the whole Arctic
Circle.

[[The]{.mark} Arctic [Council has become]{.mark} an]{.underline}
**[[essential]{.underline}]{.mark}** [**forum** [for]{.mark}
[Indigenous]{.mark} Peoples **[advocacy]{.mark}**]{.underline}, allowing
Indigenous knowledge to be utilized in scientific research,
environmental protection efforts, and sustainable development
initiatives. As one Indigenous leader put it, [the presence of Permanent
Participants ensures]{.underline} that [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
[Arctic [Council]{.mark} [is]{.mark}]{.underline} not solely
**[[focused]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[on]{.underline}]{.mark}
environmental concerns like polar bears but also on [[the]{.mark}
[people]{.mark} who **live** and **thrive** in the Arctic]{.underline}.

During its Chairship of the Arctic Council from 2023 to 2025, Norway has
made efforts to restart Arctic cooperation following a pause in official
meetings of the Arctic Council initiated by seven Arctic States in
February 2022. By focusing on non-political but critical issues such as
wildfires, Norway has managed to keep the Council functioning.
Additionally, Norway has maintained dialogue with the Indigenous Peoples
Organisations, ensuring that all six Permanent Participants remain
engaged in discussions about the Council's future.

As [[Indigenous Peoples]{.underline}]{.mark} continue to navigate the
challenges posed by climate change, resource development, and
geopolitical tensions, their [[voices]{.underline} [**must remain** at
the **centre** of Arctic governance]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The evolution
of Indigenous cooperation in the Arctic]{.underline}, from the 1973
meeting in Copenhagen to their status as Permanent Participants in the
Arctic Council, [highlights]{.underline} [the **resilience** and
**determination** of leaders of]{.underline} [Indigenous
Peoples]{.underline}. [[The]{.mark} Arctic [Council has provided
a]{.mark} **foundation** for this **engagement**]{.underline} [and
remains]{.underline} [a]{.underline} [**[crucial]{.mark}
[platform]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} **[advocating]{.mark}** [for]{.mark}
[Indigenous]{.mark} Peoples' **[rights]{.mark}**]{.underline},
environmental protection, and sustainable development, but further steps
are necessary to solidify their role. By strengthening Indigenous
Peoples' representation, the Arctic Council can continue to serve as a
model for inclusive and effective governance in the Arctic and beyond.

#### Indigenous participation in the Arctic Council is [transformative]{.underline} and [extends beyond the official processes]{.underline}.

[Process-sequencing considers the possibility of shifting directions, or
even reversals, within the trajectory of history]{.underline} (Howlett
and Rayner 2006; G. Wilson, Alcantara, and Rodon 2020). Such reversals
can take place as the result of frictions that exist between multiple
layers or players of a particular organization (Lieberman 2002) or from
recurrent patterns of institutional change that are embedded in an
organization or its surrounding context. [[The]{.mark}
[successes]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [Permanent Participants]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} meaningfully [shaping]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [content]{.mark}
and issue framing [of]{.mark} [major]{.mark} [Arctic Council outputs
suggest]{.mark} that [the Arctic Council's structure]{.mark} [is]{.mark}
[not as binding as previously thought]{.mark}. This model has risen in
prominence in political science as an alternative to path dependency or
narrative models, as it has the potential to offer a better explanation
for the creation and development of national political institutions, as
well as political ideas, discourses, and paradigms]{.underline}
(Lieberman 2002; Lindner 2003). Likewise, this approach appears more
closely aligned to the actual empirical record of changes found in many
countries and public policy sectors (Baumgartner and Jones 2002; Howlett
and Rayner 2006).

Proponents of process-sequencing argue that it has advantages over the
path dependency model, as it "provides a plausible way to represent and
account for historical trajectories, it builds social actors and
multiple causal timelines into explanatory accounts, and it offers a
richer sense of how earlier outcomes shape later ones" (Haydu 1998,
341). Sequence does matter. However, this particular theory does not
find all sequences to be irreversible; and, unlike path dependency, it
does not rely on randomized initial conditions to set an organization's
trajectory in motion. Instead, from this perspective, [reiterated
problem-solving within an organization may lead to real shifts and
changes in trajectories. In other words, process-sequencing stresses the
fact that events during an organization's existence can matter for
trajectory just as much as early lock-in events]{.underline} (Mahoney
2000), [and it likewise de-emphasizes the arbitrariness of environmental
conditions at an organization's founding]{.underline} (Abbott 1992).
Further, this approach affirms ways that organizational members'
reflections on structural development (whether negative or positive)
affect their behavior (Lindner 2003).

As such, [this perspective better captures intra-organizational Council
behavior. [Lock-in assumes that]{.mark} [Permanent Participants would
only be able to veto projects]{.mark} and develop recommendations in
Working Groups]{.underline}, since these are venues to inject influence
afforded to them in the Council's initial Rules and Procedures. [Yet,
[in the past fifteen]{.mark} [years]{.mark}, [the Permanent Participants
have ensured]{.mark} that [major]{.mark} [Council]{.mark}
[reports]{.mark} [take into account]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [human]{.mark}
[dimension of the Arctic]{.mark}, rather than just economic
factors]{.underline}, as Arctic policy tends to draw heavily from the
data and recommendations of Council's reports. [[This]{.mark}
[shift]{.mark} has [led policies]{.mark} [to be more holistic]{.mark}
[in their treatment of the region]{.mark}, meaning that they emphasize
the interconnected nature of the Arctic's many dimensions13]{.underline}
and the multi-dimensional characteristics that problem-solving must take
(Brigham 2013; Watt-Cloutier 2016). Additionally, they have ensured
Observers commit to Indigenous consultation before undertaking Arctic
extraction projects, which was unanticipated.

[In process-sequencing, change takes place in a series of steps, as
organizational paradigms are constructed and destroyed]{.underline}. One
way that this happens, best articulated by Baumgartner and Jones (2002)
(i.e., focused on the United States domestic policy arena), is
[punctuated equilibrium. In this model, incremental change and periods
of atypical dynamics join to form an overall stepped or punctuated
equilibrium pattern. [Change takes place as an]{.mark}
[irregular]{.mark}, [stepped function]{.mark} when relatively prolonged
periods of stability are broken up by occasional periods of
change]{.underline}. Within the context of an organization, this means
that [routine periods of non-innovative behavior, when members utilize
existing processes and resources, are interspersed by atypical behavior
that involves new activities]{.underline}. These activities "represent a
sharp break from how processes were developed, conceived, and
implemented in the past, but are still rooted in 'the same general or
member-specific concerns or problems' (Howlett and Rayner 2006, 16,
emphasis added). Similarly, Howlett and Rayner (2006) suggest that,
while it is more common for punctuation to happen in subsystem
equilibriums, at the systemic or regime level, things tend to be more
stable. This perspective implies that, [[for the Arctic Council]{.mark}
(i.e., a major, but single organization in the mosaic that makes up the
Arctic governance system) [reversals are possible]{.mark}, [and]{.mark}
[are]{.mark} more theoretically [likely]{.mark}, especially when
combined with member persistence]{.underline}.

In the Arctic, it seems not only to be the case that understandings of
sovereignty are evolving (Branch 2011; Whyte 2017), but also that
[understandings of organizational constraints are shifting in to
consider organizational structures less static than previously
anticipated. After all, Permanent Participants are coming up with new
ways to assert their interests, with a particular boom of activity after
a decade-long lull post-Council creation]{.underline}.

[[At the Council's founding]{.mark}, and even through the early 2000s,
[few stakeholders could have imagined]{.mark} that [Permanent
Participants would create their own policy papers]{.mark} that would
compete with over 200 other actors to inform the content of the Arctic
Marine Shipping Assessment (2009), or conduct a multi-year oral history
collection as traditional knowledge data for the Arctic Impact Climate
Assessment (2004). Such strategies required those Permanent Participants
who were involved to expend significant costs, labor, and resources that
would not be funded or institutionally supported by the Council.
[Yet]{.mark} [Permanent]{.mark} [Participant]{.mark} referenced and used
these intra-organizational products in the development of major Arctic
Council outputs, which [would go on to have real and significant
impacts]{.mark} on state shipping and transit policies and the
benchmarks states use to measure the effects of climate change over
time]{.underline}.

#### Resource extraction in the Arctic is guided by [benefit-sharing frameworks]{.underline} that [recognize Indigenous sovereignty]{.underline} and ensuring [good-faith negotiations]{.underline} rather than imposing control.

Editorial to the Special Issue: Benefit Sharing in the Arctic:
Extractive Industries and Arctic People The Arctic has a long history of
[[extractive industry]{.underline} [activity]{.underline}]{.mark} that
shaped local communities and regional economies. Some of these colonial
path dependencies could be considered negative lock-ins to perpetuate
boom and bust economic cycles, accumulate resources in the hands of
companies, deprive local residents of access to traditional activities
and cause land degradation and pollution \[1--3\]. However, extractive
industries, [despite negative impacts, [have]{.mark} also
[created]{.mark} **[new wealth and local investment]{.mark}** [in
infrastructure]{.mark} with benefits beyond the industry
itself]{.underline} \[4,5\]. [In some communities, extractive industries
have become an essential element of the local social, economic and
political environment]{.underline} \[6\]. As new resource development
comes to the Arctic, the question of benefit sharing becomes as relevant
as ever. [[Benefit sharing is the]{.mark} [distribution of monetary and
non-monetary benefits]{.mark} [between extractive industries and]{.mark}
[communities]{.mark}]{.underline} a ected by extractive operations. [The
essence of benefit sharing]{.underline}, however, [[goes beyond mere
compensation for damage]{.mark} or investment in local
society]{.underline}. [[First]{.underline}]{.mark} of all[,]{.underline}
[[it is about]{.mark} the **[recognition of]{.mark} the [rights]{.mark}
and interests [of]{.mark} the [Indigenous]{.mark}** and local
communities]{.underline}, [[their]{.mark} [sovereignty]{.mark} over
resources [and]{.mark} the [knowledge]{.mark} that they share with the
industry]{.underline}. [[Benefit sharing]{.underline}]{.mark} is rooted
in the Convention on Biological Diversity (1992) and Nagoya Protocol
(2010) \[7\] and [[emphasizes the need to **allocate**]{.mark} **the
[benefits]{.mark} coming [from]{.mark} natural resources
[extraction]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} the **[local
actors]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In this situation, Indigenous and local
communities are viewed as rights-, stake- and knowledge holders.
[[Second]{.underline}]{.mark}ly, [benefit sharing [is about]{.mark}
**[addressing]{.mark} social justice and [inequalities]{.mark}** between
communities and those who commercialize resources]{.underline} \[8\].
[In this sense, it directly links to the corporate social
responsibility]{.underline} ([[CSR]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[and]{.mark}
the social license to operate]{.underline} ([[SLO]{.underline}]{.mark})
[that companies must earn in order to meet the expectation of being
responsible]{.underline} \[9\]. [[More so]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[benefit sharing is a mech]{.mark}anism [to support]{.mark} free, prior
and informed consent]{.underline} (FPIC) [through **[good-faith
negotiations]{.mark}**]{.underline} and meaningful consultations with
Indigenous and local residents a ected by extractive industry \[10,11\].
[[Third]{.underline}]{.mark}ly, [[benefit]{.mark} [sharing is
about]{.mark} the **[empowerment of]{.mark}**]{.underline} (or regaining
control by) the **[[Indigenous Peoples]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and local
communities in the resource-use process]{.underline}, especially in
benefits that are negotiated as a part of FPIC and resource
co-management \[2,12\]. [[Finally]{.underline}]{.mark}, [benefit sharing
may be instrumental [in attaining sustainable]{.mark}, long-term
economic [development in Arctic communities]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[13,14\]. However, not all forms of benefit sharing lead to the desired
outcomes \[9,15\].

### State Good

#### Indigenous engagement with the state is good\-\--self-determination and sovereignty achieved through collaboration with the government is highly effective

[[Inuit are in the best position to inform the world of]{.mark} the ways
in which [climate change]{.mark} is impacting their
homeland]{.underline}. The relationship to and understanding of the land
that accompanies thousands of years of living sustainably in the Arctic
is a perspective that Inuit hold, and one that is vital to our
international understanding of how to approach Arctic governance. In
Canada, [[Inuit]{.mark} have [achieved considerable ability to
participate in governance]{.mark} on the matters that affect them most.
This has [culminated over decades of Inuit determination to be included
in]{.mark} these [policy]{.mark} and governance
[matters]{.mark}.]{.underline} This [level of **[engagement between
Inuit and the Government]{.mark} of Canada, facilitated by these Inuit
organizations, [shows how powerful and effective]{.mark} Indigenous
[organizations can be in achieving]{.mark} Indigenous
[self-determination]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Of course, the nation-state
also has to be willing to engage with these organizations, in this case
being the Government of Canada. [[Canada]{.mark} has recently
[shown]{.mark} their [commitment to work with Indigenous groups
in Canada's Arctic and Northern Policy
Framework]{.mark}]{.underline}[ ]{.mark}(2019). This level of commitment
towards collaboration does not exist in every nation-state around the
world, often making it difficult for Indigenous organizations to achieve
the level of collaboration they desire. Nonetheless, [this example of
[collaboration between Inuit and the Government]{.mark} of Canada
[demonstrates]{.mark} the [decision-making capabilities that]{.mark} can
[arise]{.mark} out of Indigenous organizations' fight towards
self-determination.]{.underline} At the international level,
[[Inuit]{.mark} have been [involved in policymaking through]{.mark} the
[Inuit Circumpolar Council]{.mark}, a [Permanent Participant on]{.mark}
the most influential governing body for the circumpolar region, [the
Arctic Council.]{.mark}]{.underline} At the state level in Canada,
[Inuit have been [involved in policymaking through the Inuit Tapiriit
Kanatami]{.mark}, the national association for Inuit in
Canada.]{.underline} Finally, the four Inuit land claim agreements that
exist in Canada have also contributed greatly to Inuit ability to
participate in policymaking and governance decisions affecting the
Canadian Arctic.

These [**Inuit [organizations are excellent examples of]{.mark} the
[potential and ability]{.mark} that organizations have [to facilitate
Indigenous sovereignty within a settler colonial
state]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The [success of these organizations may
very well be a model that other Indigenous groups around the world can
follow.]{.underline} The organizations discussed throughout this paper
and undoubtedly many more Indigenous organizations all around the world
create and develop policy solutions for the issues that they understand
best. [These representative organizations and the reports they create
should always be consulted and discussed in the making of any relevant
policy.]{.underline} Organizations like those discussed in this paper
are crucial pieces in facilitating the conversation between Indigenous
groups and the states in which they reside.

#### Laws uphold Indigenous rights\-\--Arctic Indigenous groups have contributed to legal norms to create better forums that can work to address inequalities and increase representation

[The [state-based system of international law]{.mark} is replete with
examples of its structured
contradictions.]{.underline}[53](https://brill.com/view/journals/nord/93/1/article-p152_008.xml?language=en&srsltid=AfmBOoo-07QITbG0qc_rJdUXDqL2ppmx0H8n6XGQcT-Jwa5MTTeiTpUg#fn0053) It
forbids the initiation of war and also provides the rules for its
conduct, facilitates international industrial trade and the exploitation
of non-renewable resources, and also purports to limit emissions, and in
this case, it [[provides rules to uphold Indigenous Peoples'
rights]{.mark} while at the same time paying homage to the wealth and
sovereignties constructed at their expense.]{.underline} International
law underpins the capitalist-colonial project, while at the same time
attempting to minimise the damage of that very endeavour. The
international legal system is comprised of states, but the world is made
up of peoples, who live as nations across, within, and between, state
borders. [[Despite various failures]{.mark} of international law to
recognise or address centuries of structural violence, dispossession,
and disenfranchisement, [Arctic Indigenous Peoples have,]{.mark} through
their own persistence, [mastered and contributed to]{.mark} the
[development of]{.mark} the Western European [legal norms]{.mark} in a
system that once facilitated their colonisation.]{.underline} The
[fiftieth anniversary of the [Arctic Peoples' Conferen]{.mark}ce was a
moment to [reflect on]{.mark} these and other [achievements of Arctic
Indigenous Peoples]{.mark}, [building upon]{.mark} the [1973
resolutions]{.mark} and addressing contemporary challenges.]{.underline}
The 2023 Joint Statement addresses the need for enhanced engagement in
the forums of international law, intergenerational justice, intersecting
rights to wellbeing, land, water and natural resources, and to address
the risks posed by climate change and colonialism. It [reflects on
[Arctic Indigenous Peoples']{.mark} "[contributions to various national
and international governing bodies]{.mark} and how our way forward [was
paved]{.mark} by the people, now elders, who first came together [to
envision a better
future]{.mark}]{.underline}."[54](https://brill.com/view/journals/nord/93/1/article-p152_008.xml?language=en&srsltid=AfmBOoo-07QITbG0qc_rJdUXDqL2ppmx0H8n6XGQcT-Jwa5MTTeiTpUg#fn0054) Although
Arctic Indigenous Peoples "have survived, and thrived, through hundreds
of years of colonization ... many challenges and colonial systems remain
to be
dismantled."[55](https://brill.com/view/journals/nord/93/1/article-p152_008.xml?language=en&srsltid=AfmBOoo-07QITbG0qc_rJdUXDqL2ppmx0H8n6XGQcT-Jwa5MTTeiTpUg#fn0055) [[Within]{.mark}
the [forums of international law, Arctic Indigenous Peoples]{.mark}
continue to [work to address inequalities in representation and
recognition]{.mark}, and to [insist that]{.mark} the
[rules]{.mark}-[based international legal order upholds]{.mark} the
[rights]{.mark}, [interests]{.mark}, [and sovereignties]{.mark} of those
it has systematically excluded.]{.underline}

### Collaboration Possible/Good

#### Collaboration between Indigenous groups and legal systems is [necessary]{.underline} to create solutions to Arctic challenges\-\--both systems must learn from each other in order to fill knowledge gaps needed to solve

[[Law]{.mark} in general [and indigenous law]{.mark} in particular
[have]{.mark} a niche and [significant role to play when it comes
to]{.mark} various [issues and developments in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}, but without real advocates and competent
bearers of this knowledge, \"first of all among indigenous peoples
themselves, it is challenging for a dominant national legal culture to
become more flexible and inclusive of indigenous law. [Important
questions in the many years ahead would be: how law (both indigenous and
State) and legal systems could assist in dealing with current and
emergent challenges and opportunities in the North]{.underline}? How
these legal systems and customary/indigenous law practices are efficient
and legitimate in the eyes of Northerners (both indigenous and other
residents)? How existing pluralism and co-existence of indigenous and
non-indigenous law practices can contribute to the resolution of issues
of common concern in the Arctic? In other words, [more **[legal
cooperation and understanding]{.mark} of [indigenous law]{.mark} and its
workability [with]{.mark} national [legal systems is required to fill in
knowledge gaps and find plausible solutions to]{.mark} the many [issues
and challenges of Arctic developments]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Canadian
experience of the Inuit of Eastern and Central Arctic shows that [the
[national legal system can learn a lot from indigenous forms of dispute
resolution]{.mark} and a more inquisitorial manner of dealing with the
judicial process; [it can]{.mark} also [show]{.mark} more [flexibility
in ensuring]{.mark} the [harmonious co-existence of both "Western" and
indigenous legal traditions]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Both national and
[indigenous legal systems could]{.mark} further [learn from each
other,]{.mark} so as further actions may be required to ensure the
continuity, rejuvenation and revitalization of indigenous law in the
existing legal thinking and practicing.44]{.underline}

### Movements Fail

#### They fail\-\--society is [unreceptive]{.underline}.

**White '20**, Jenna, \"Success and Failure of Indigenous Social
Movements: a Comparative Case Study of Ecuador and Chile\" (2020).
Honors Theses. 1353. <https://egrove.olemiss.edu/hon_thesis/1353> , DOA:
7/15/2025)//LFS---LMH

[The Mapuche [social movement is unsuccessful as a result of an
unreceptive society]{.mark} to change]{.underline}. A lack of unity
within the group and with the general population and a strained
relationship with the state that makes it difficult for the other
Chileans and respected political parties to align their goals with the
Mapuche, so their cause does not seem worthy for the masses. [[The
indigenous people of Ecuador established a]{.mark} communication
[network between the indigenous people and the Ecuadorian
state]{.mark}]{.underline}, [so that they may have power in the national
government]{.underline}. [[As a result, they achieved]{.mark} a
[constitutional reform]{.mark} and ousted two presidents with help from
the police and armed forces. [The]{.mark} indigenous social [movement
now fails because they do not have]{.mark} unity with the general
population and [the alliance with]{.mark} respected [political
groups]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the terms of social movement theories,
the structural strain theory is most useful to explain why the social
movement of Ecuador was successful, whereas, the Mapuche in Chile do not
achieve success and Ecuador's now fails. [The resource mobilization
theory is the most basic theory and says that a community with a
grievance can help alleviate the grievance with a mobilization of
resources, including money, labor, social status, knowledge, support of
the media, and support from the elite. In my analysis, it is not
indicated that the Mapuche are any more successful with the resource of
CONADI than they were before the formation of CONADI.]{.underline} Also,
the indigenous people of Ecuador gained support as their movement became
more successful, so this does not provide convincing evidence that a
change in resources leads to the successes, or failure, of the
indigenous social movements. The structural strain theory is similar to
the resource mobilization theory[, but it has one descriptor that is key
to success. There are six requirements for a social movement to be
successful: people in society experience deprivation, people recognize
the deprivation, a solution is proposed, events occur to begin motion of
the movement, the society needs to be open to change, and there will be
mobilization of resources. The most important aspect in this to explain
the successes and failures is that society, or the government, must be
in a position to be open to change.]{.underline} There must be a strain
in society that creates holes in a system that must be filled. The
Mapuche experienced a deprivation---lack of government recognition that
led to land privatization---and the people recognized this and began
planning protests. However, [the society is not very open to change and
there is a lack of unity in the solutions proposed for their
deprivation]{.underline}; both of these facts makes it impossible to
have success in a social movement. Conversely, the indigenous people of
Ecuador acted through each step to gain success; [one form of success is
constitutional reform]{.underline}. [They recognized that they did not
have a nationally recognized identity]{.underline}, [so they formed a
political party and opened communication networks between different
groups of indigenous people so that they were able to unite around 16
demands]{.underline}. [The society was open to change]{.underline}, in
large part because the majority of Ecuadorians have some indigenous
blood and there was an economic crisis in which the majority were
affected when their first measurable success came to fruition. The
difference between the case in Chile and Ecuador according to the
structural strain theory is the level of manifestation organization and
unity and openness to change from others. The new social movement
theories do a better job of explaining why social movements begin in the
first place. The resource mobilization theory and the structural strain
theory are best used to understand how social movements gain success.
The new social movement theories focus on culture and identity as a
catalyst for social movements. [They also defend personal autonomy and
resist government expansion]{.underline}. This explains both the
beginnings of the social movement of indigenous people in Ecuador and
Chile, but does not offer an explanation as to why the Mapuche do not
have success when they do defend personal autonomy and resist government
expansion. Therefore, I rely on the structural strain theory.

#### Movements fail and create

Standing Rock and the #NoDAPL campaign so historic? Factors affecting
American Indian participation in social movement collaborations and
coalitions", *Ethnic and Racial Studies*, 42:7, 1070-1090, 2019, DOI:

[Post-Obama developments and future of native-participation in
grassroots social movement coalitions After Donald [Trump]{.mark}
assumed the Presidency in January 2017, the Executive branch of the US
[government]{.mark} [threw]{.mark} its [support]{.mark} [behind]{.mark}
the [DAPL]{.mark}. By that time, at the request of the Standing Rock
Sioux, many [supporters]{.mark} had [left the encampments]{.mark}
following the Obama administration's rescinding of approval for the
project. This created a changed context in a number of ways. First, the
[loss of elite allies meant]{.mark} the [likelihood of success]{.mark}
[was lower]{.mark}, and the lack of support from powerful or ascendant
political actors may have undermined willingness to further commit to
the cause. This might be have been [particularly true for
environmentalists]{.mark} for whom other campaigns could newly appear as
more promising and strategic. [Secondly]{.mark}, the [advance]{.mark} of
the project [in]{.mark} political, bureaucratic and [material terms
meant]{.mark} that the previous mixed strategy --of [direct]{.mark}
[action]{.mark} by water protectors in support of the tribe's legal
rights and federal consulting obligations -- [appeared]{.mark} to be
[inadequate]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is especially the case given that
the majority of the pipeline was built under the Obama administration,
even with its belated rhetorical support. Thus, energy has shifted to
additional tactics that are less rooted in Standing Rock camps,
especially to divestment from DAPL-funding banks and alliances with
other pipeline resistance campaigns. Additional strategic and tactical
choices, including more militant actions, might also appear more
attractive to some activists. [Other [developments remain to be
seen.]{.mark} Looking [beyond]{.mark} [Standing Rock, what are the
implications]{.mark} of the #NoDAPL protests [for]{.mark}
[future]{.mark} grassroots [coalitions]{.mark} featuring American Indian
participants? Direct and indirect interactions at Standing Rock
certainly expanded and deepened social ties within and across the
American Indian and environmental movements, so that there are [now
additional bridges]{.mark} that can facilitate collective action.
Complementing this, non-Native participants in the campaign may have
developed a more sophisticated understanding of settler colonialism,
tribal nationhood, and Native relationships to place, or what Potawatomi
scholar-activist Kyle Whyte describes as "the larger story" of DAPL
(2017). Similarly, non-Native allies now likely have more direct
experience of American Indian culture and, one imagines, a heightened
functional ability to engage in the protocol that is relevant to working
together with Indian people and also to navigate the complex landscape
of inter-tribal collaborations. All of these potential impacts on
participants, however, are topics requiring further
research.]{.underline} Another possible impact of Standing Rock is the
expansion and deepening of indigenous ecological frameworks into
environmental discourse. One of the central messages from the campaign,
Mni Wiconi or "water is life", represents a practical perspective that
nonetheless operates outside of utilitarian views of nature. [At a time
that left, progressive, environmental and other forces are struggling to
generate new stories and political visions beyond assumptions centred on
(and limited by) the two party system and neoliberal paradigms, "water
is life" offers one element of a grounded yet sweeping and critical
alternative. [One final possible outcome of the #NoDAPL campaign may be
more division among American Indians regarding the sufficiency of legal
and institutional means for protecting land, water and species.]{.mark}
If this campaign reveals the inability of tribes' legal, treaty and
consultancy rights to defend the most fundamental necessities of life
for tribal communities, more criticism of tribal governments' reliance
on these means may grow. [If so, this could further exacerbate the
political distance between Indigenous militants and warrior societies on
one hand, and tribal officials on the other.]{.mark} [Open criticism of
tribal governments,]{.mark} particularly of those seen as
assimilationist and overly bureaucratic -- and sometimes corrupt -- is
more common in Canada, where Reserve Bands are more fundamentally
accountable to the settler state. A [widening of public intra-nation and
intra-American Indian dissent regarding dominant tribal political
strategies would represent a new development with uncertain
consequences.]{.mark} The likelihood of future coalitions including or
led by American Indians will be shaped by the factors identified above,
but in a new, post-Standing Rock context. It is very possible that the
Standing Rock campaign "broke the ice", and its example may transform
and amplify the possibilities for subsequent coalitions and
collaborations.]{.underline} Indeed, many campaigns are being cast as
"the next Standing Rock". 4 The threat factor will likely continue, as
aggressive and threatening energy extraction projects show no signs of
winding down, 1086 E. STEINMAN even with renewable energy sources
increasingly in sight. Some such extraction projects do and will affect
tribal communities, making them uniquely positioned to challenge such
projects if they choose to do so (which is affected by internal tribal
politics). Not every threatening project, however, will be as clearly
linked to global climate concerns and function as a rallying point for
this global concern. [Regarding such similar contexts, there is now
likely much greater capacity across American Indian and environmental
networks to engage in coalition efforts supporting tribal communities.
However, the local presence of ties and accumulated knowledge may vary,
and may be crucial. If the dense local intermovement ties informing
#NoDAPLare lacking, other local campaigns may not scale up nearly as
effectively. [The presence or lack of elite allies at local, state and
national levels may also be an important factor regarding whether
threats, ties and intercultural knowledge and skills are translated into
robust coalitions.]{.mark} Without encouragement and identifiable
pathways for translating grassroots action into desired changes, small
and local efforts to resist projects may not result in such an
outpouring of support. Furthermore, recently proposed legislation in
numerous states criminalizing various protest activities (Yoder 2017)
would increase the legal and financial costs of collective
action.]{.underline}

[[Pessimism Trap 1: A Clear Demarcation of Indigenous Individuals
into Only Two Categories, 'Authentic' and
'Co-Opted']{.mark}]{.underline} For Indigenous resurgence theorists,
these two categories are the only possibilities, [and there is no grey
area in-between]{.underline}. In their view, Indigenous peoples are
co-opted if they hold elected offce, make land claims or economic
development agreements with governments or industry, or even sign
treaties. Furthermore, co-opted Indigenous peoples are so co-opted, that
they do not even recognise how they are being used and colonised by the
state and its private-sector partners. On the other hand, authentic
Indigenous peoples live on their traditional lands, speak their Native
languages, [[practice]{.mark} their [culture]{.mark} and [govern]{.mark}
themselves [in traditional fashion]{.mark}]{.underline}. [They are the
only [ones that have successfully resisted]{.mark} the overwhelming
forces of colonisation and its powers of cooptation]{.underline}, and
the only ones with the power to do so into the future. In his 2005 book,
Wasáse: Indigenous Pathways of Action and Freedom, [Taiaiake Alfred
calls on the original people]{.underline}, what he calls Onkwehonwe in
the Mohawk language, to unify in resisting the colonial structures that
continue to oppress them.5 Relying on warrior imagery in the Mohawk
tradition, Alfred confronts Indigenous people to recognise Western
domination in our communities and resist it. He argues forcefully that
Indigenous peoples have become overly complacent on, and even dependent
upon, Western social, economic and political structures. He calls for a
resurgence in Indigenous spirituality and political structures in
Indigenous communities. [As he sees it, [a strong Indigenous warrior is
not one that necessarily engages in war and violent resistance but,
rather, is one that shows real courage by living a daily life grounded
in the spiritual teachings and practices of our
ancestors.]{.mark}]{.underline} The decolonising revolution he calls for
is rooted within the peaceful resurgence of traditional spirituality and
governance. As he writes, 'There are people in all communities who
understand that a true decolonization movement can emerge only when we
shift our politics from articulating grievances to pursuing an organized
and political battle for the cause of our freedom. These new warriors
understand the need to refuse any further disconnection from their
heritage and the need to reconnect with the spiritual bases of their
existences'.6 [While [at first glance]{.mark}, this book represents a
powerful and [compelling]{.mark} call to action by Indigenous
communities and leaders, a [closer examination reveals]{.mark} all three
pessimism [traps in play]{.mark} throughout the text. Alfred [draws
a]{.mark} sharp [line between]{.mark} [authentic]{.mark} Indigenous
[approaches and co-opted]{.mark} ones. As he puts it, ['Not all of us
have been conquered]{.mark}. There are still strong Onkwehonwe who
persevere in their struggle for an authentic existence and who are
capable of redefning, regenerating, and reimagining our collective
existences'.7 Yet, he warns, 'The colonizers stand on guard for their
ill-gotten privileges using highly advanced techniques, mainly
co-optation, division and when required, physical repression' and 'with
its massive resources, [the state can co-opt leadership and movement
successes']{.mark}.8 Furthermore, Alfred notes, the authentic Indigenous
peoples and leaders are no longer the majority, as the co-opted ones
seem to occupy most of the leadership roles in organisations and
communit]{.underline}ies. [Lamenting the constant temptations for
co-optation on offer, from land claims agreements, to casino capitalism,
to chief and council salaries, Alfred writes, '[Working for a cause that
has indigenous integrity means sacrifce]{.mark}. ...This is the reality
of an authentic indigenous existence in political terms. And, evidently,
in our communities today, there are only a few people who are convinced
that taking on the psychological and fnancial burden of being really
indigenous is worth the fght'.9 Similar patterns appear in Alfred's
follow-up 2009 book, Peace, Power, Righteousness: An Indigenous
Manifesto. 10 In this work, Alfred walks the reader through Indigenous
values, weaving a thesis that a new kind of Indigenous leadership,
characterised by the resurgence of Indigenous forms of
self-determination, is the only way to resist colonialism and preserve
what still exists of Indigenous culture and lifeways today[. In a
Fanonian spirit, he challenges Indigenous]{.mark} [peoples]{.mark}, and
particularly leaders, professionals and academics, [to be aware]{.mark}
of how colonialism has impacted them and their communities on every
level, including and especially, psychologically. He challenges
Indigenous leadership and communities to recognise these multiple layers
of colonialism in current contemporary practice, and to resist them. As
in his earlier work, Alfred divides Indigenous peoples, communities and
leadership into two stark categories: authentic and co-opted. Indigenous
leaders, he says, either actively resist,]{.underline} [or they
co-operate with the state]{.underline}. [When they co-operate with the
state]{.underline}, they 'rationalize and participate actively in their
own subordination and the maintenance of the Other's superiority' and
therefore become co-opted.11 Further, he sees that as states have moved
away from overt violent control of Indigenous communities, co-option has
become the preferred method of control and subordination: The fact is
that neither the state-sponsored modifcations to the colonial-municipal
model ...nor the corporate or public-government systems recently
negotiated in the North constitute indigenous governments at all.
Potentially representing the fnal solution to the white society's
'Indian Problem,' they use the co-operation of Native leaders in the
design and implementation of such systems to legitimize the state's
longstanding assimilationist goals for indigenous nations and lands.12
One of the deepest problems, according to Alfred, [is that co-opted
communities]{.underline}, leaders and professionals do not often even
realise that they are, in fact, co-opted. Co-option, he says, ['is a
subtle]{.underline}, insidious, undeniable fact, and it has resulted in
a collective loss of ability to confront the daily injustices, both
petty and profound, of Native life'.13 As a case in point, Alfred
engages in a substantial discussion of how the concept of sovereignty
itself is Western in focus and therefore, when Indigenous leaders
advocate for it, on behalf of their nations and communities, they are
unwittingly engaging in a politics of co-optation. 'Shallow-minded
politicians', Alfred writes, 'are unable to grasp that asserting a right
to sovereignty has signifcant implications'. [[When they assert a claim
to sovereignty but not to resist the state itself, 'they are making a
choice to accept the state as their model and to allow indigenous
political goals to be framed and evaluated according to a "statist"
pattern']{.underline}]{.mark}.14 Another prominent member of the
Indigenous resurgence school, Glen Coulthard (Yellowknives Dene), was
mentored by Taiaiake Alfred and their common philosophy is immediately
apparent. As Alfred writes in his foreword to Coulthard's 2014 book, Red
Skin, White Masks: Rejecting the Colonial Politics of Recognition,
['Coulthard is talking about rising up]{.underline}, ...about resurgence
and the politics of self-affrmation. This is a call to combat
contemporary colonialism's objectifcation and alienation and
manipulation of our true selves'.15 Coulthard critiques the current
Canadian policy atmosphere of reconciliation as contemporary
colonialism, ultimately the same as the old colonialism, but with a new
mask. He argues the structure of the settler colonial invasion continues
to dispossess and oppress Indigenous peoples, as it always has, but it
now has a new face: the disingenuous liberal politics of
recognition---which includes such current policy initiatives as the
delegation of self-determination, economic development and the
settlement of land claims. [He begins by noting that over the past forty
years or so, there has been an 'unprecedented degree of recognition for
Aboriginal "cultural" rights within the legal and political framework of
the Canadian state'.16 Coulthard acknowledges that the increase in
recognition demands coming from Indigenous intellectual and community
leaders are largely responsible for these changes to the structure of
the Indigenous-state relationship in Canada. Yet, Coulthard's goal in
this work is to challenge the notion that 'the colonial relationship
between Indigenous peoples and the Canadian state can be adequately
transformed via such a politics of recognition'.17 Rather than ushering
in a new relationship, he argues, the 'politics of recognition in its
contemporary liberal form promises to reproduce the very confgurations
of colonialist, racist, patriarchal state power that Indigenous peoples'
demands for recognition have historically sought to
transcend'.18]{.underline}

[Pessimism Trap 2: The State is Unified, Deliberate and Unchanging
in Its Desire to Dispossess Indigenous Peoples and Gain Unfettered
Access to Indigenous Lands and Resources In other words, colonialism by
settler states is a constant, not a variable, in both outcome and
intent.]{.underline} Further, the state is not only intentionally
colonial, but it is also unifed in its desire to co-opt Indigenous
peoples as a method and means of control. In 2005's Wasase, Alfred
presents the state as unitary, intentional and unchanging in its desire
to colonise and oppress Indigenous peoples noting, 'I think that the
only thing that has changed since our ancestors frst declared war on the
invaders is that some of us have lost heart'.22 Referring to current
state policies as a 'self-termination movement', Alfred states, 'It is
senseless to advocate for an accord with imperialism while there is a
steady and intense ongoing attack by the Settler society on everything
meaningful to us: our cultures, our communities, and our deep
attachments to land'.23 Alfred's Peace, Power, Righteousness (2009) also
argues that the state is deliberate and unchanging, stating quite
plainly that 'it is still the objective of the Canadian and US
governments to remove Indians, or, failing that, to prevent them from
beneftting, from their ancestral territories'.24 Contemporary states do
this, he argues, not through outright violent control but 'by
insidiously promoting a form of neo-colonial self-government in our
communities and forcing our integration into the legal mainstream'.25
According to Alfred, the state 'relegates indigenous peoples' rights to
the past, and constrains the development of their societies by allowing
only those activities that support its own necessary illusion: that
indigenous peoples today do not present a serious challenge to its
legitimacy'.26 Linking back to the aim of co-option, Alfred argues that
while the state's desire to control Indigenous peoples and lands has
never changed, the techniques for doing so have become subtler over
time. 'Recognizing the power of the indigenous challenge and unable to
deny it a voice', due to successful Indigenous resistance over the
years, 'the state has (now) attempted to pull indigenous people closer
to it'.27 [According to Alfred, the state has outwitted Indigenous
leaders and 'encouraged them to reframe and moderate their nationhood
demands to accept the fait accompli of colonization, (and) to
collaborate in the development of a "solution" that does not challenge
the fundamental imperial lie'.28 In a similar vein, Coulthard's central
argument is centred on his understanding of the dual structure of
colonialism. Drawing directly from Fanon, Coulthard fnds that
colonialism relies on both objective and subjective elements. The
objective components involve domination through the political, economic
and legal structures of the colonial state. The subjective elements of
colonialism involve the creation of 'colonized subjects', including a
process of internalisation by which colonised subjects come to not only
accept the limited forms of 'misrecognition' granted through the state
but can even come to identify with it.29 Through this dual structure,
colonial power now works through the inclusion of Indigenous peoples,
actively shaping their perspectives in line with state discourses,
rather than merely excluding them, as in years past. Therefore, any
attempt to seek 'the reconciliation of Indigenous nationhood with state
sovereignty is still colonial insofar as it remains structurally
committed to the dispossession of Indigenous peoples of our lands and
self-determining authority'.30 Concerning the state in relation to
Indigenous peoples on the international level, Corntassel argues that
states and global organisations, for years, have been consistently
framing Indigenous peoples' self-determination claims in ways that
'jeopardize the futures of indigenous communities'.31 He claims that
states frst compartmentalise Indigenous self-determination by separating
lands and resources from political and legal recognition of a limited
autonomy. Second, he notes, states sometimes deny the existence of
Indigenous peoples living within their borders. Thirdly, a political and
legal entitlement framing by states deemphasises other responsibilities.
Finally, he claims that states, through the rights discourse, limit the
frameworks through which Indigenous peoples can seek self-determination.
Like Alfred and Coulthard, Corntassel has concluded that states are
deliberate and never changing in their behaviour.]{.underline} With this
move, Corntassel limits and actually demeans Indigenous agency,
overlooking the reality that Indigenous organisations themselves chose
the human rights framework and rights discourse as a target sphere of
action precisely because, as was evident in earlier struggles like
slavery, civil rights or women's rights, these were tools available to
them that had a proven track record of opening up new possibilities and
shifting previous state positions and behaviour. Indigenous advocates
also cleverly realised, by the 1970s, that the anti-discrimination and
decolonisation frames could be used together against states. States did,
in no way, nefariously impose a rights framework on Indigenous peoples.
[Rather, Indigenous organisations and savvy Indigenous political actors
deliberately chose to frame their self-determination struggles within
the human rights framework in order to bring states into a double bind
where they could not credibly claim to adhere to human rights and claim
that they uphold equality while simultaneously denying Indigenous
peoples' human rights and leaving them with a diminished and unequal
right of self-determination. But, because he is caught in the pessimism
trap of seeing the state only as unifed, deliberate and unchanging,
Corntassel overlooks and diminishes the clear story of Indigenous agency
and the potential for positive change in advancing self-determination in
a multitude of ways.]{.underline}

[Pessimism Trap 3: Engagement with the Settler State is Futile, if Not
Counter-Productive Since the state always intends to maintain, if not
expand, colonial control, and is seeking to co-opt as many Indigenous
peoples as possible in order to maintain or expand its dispossession and
control, it is therefore futile, at best, and actually dangerous to
Indigenous existence to engage with the state]{.underline}. Furthermore,
all patterns of engagement will lead to co-optation as the state is
cunning and unrelenting in its desire to co-opt Indigenous leaders,
academics and professionals in order to gain or maintain control of
Indigenous peoples. Alfred argues, in both his 2005 and 2009 books, that
any Indigenous engagement with the state, including agreements and
negotiations, is not only futile but fundamentally dangerous, as such
pathways do not directly challenge the existing colonial structure and
'to argue on behalf of indigenous nationhood within the dominant Western
paradigm is self-defeating'.32 [Alfred states that a 'notion of
nationhood or self-government rooted in state institutions and framed
within the context of state sovereignty can never satisfy the
imperatives of Native American political traditions'33 because the
possibility for a true expression of Indigenous self-determination is
'precluded by the state's insistence on dominion and its exclusionary
notion of sovereignty'.34 Worst of all, according to Alfred, when
Indigenous communities frame their struggles in terms of asserting
Aboriginal rights and title, but do so within a state framework, rather
than resisting the state itself, it 'represents the culmination of white
society's efforts to assimilate indigenous peoples'.35 Because it is
impossible to advance Indigenous self-determination through any sort of
engagement with the state, Coulthard also advocates for an Indigenous
resurgence paradigm that follows both his mentor Taiaiake Alfred but
also Anishinaabe feminist theorist Leanne Simpson.36 As Coulthard
writes, 'both Alfred and Simpson start from a position that calls on
Indigenous peoples and communities to "turn away" from the assimilative
reformism of the liberal recognition approach and to instead build our
national liberation efforts on the revitalization of "traditional"
political values and practices'.37 Drawing upon the prescriptive
approach of these theorists, Coulthard proposes, in his concluding
chapter, fve theses from his analysis that are intended to build and
solidify Indigenous resurgence into the future:]{.underline}

1\.

On the necessity of direct action, meaning that physical forms of
Indigenous resistance, like protest and blockades, are very important
not only as a reaction to the state but also as a means of protecting
the lands that are central to Indigenous peoples' existence;

2\.

Capitalism, No More!, meaning the rejection of capitalist forms of
economic development in Indigenous communities in favour of land-based
Indigenous political-economic alternative approaches;

3\.

Dispossession and Indigenous Sovereignty in the City, meaning the need
for Indigenous resurgence movements 'to address the interrelated systems
of dispossession that shape Indigenous peoples' experiences
in both urban and land-based
settings'[38](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-21780-8_10#FPar1);

4\.

Gender Justice and Decolonisation, meaning that decolonisation must also
include a shift away from patriarchy and an embrace of gender relations
that are non-violent and reflective of the centrality of women in
traditional forms of Indigenous governance and society; and

5\.

Beyond the Nation-State. While Coulthard denies that he advocates
complete rejection of engagement with the state's political and legal
system, he does assert that 'our efforts to engage these discursive and
institutional spaces to secure recognition of our rights have not only
failed, but have instead served to subtly reproduce the forms of racist,
sexist, economic, and political configurations of power that we
initially sought...to
challenge'.[39](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-21780-8_10#FPar1) He
therefore advocates expressly for 'critical self-reflection, skepticism,
and caution' in a 'resurgent politics of recognition that seeks to
practice decolonial, gender-emancipatory, and economically
nonexploitative alternative structures of law and sovereign authority
grounded on a critical refashioning of the best of Indigenous legal and
political
traditions'.[40](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-21780-8_10#FPar1)

Corntassel also demonstrates the third pessimism trap, that all
engagement with the state is ultimately futile. For the most part,
however, Corntassel's observation is that the UN system operates like a
reverse Keck and Sikkink 'boomerang model' and 'channels the energies of
transnational Indigenous networks into the institutional fiefdoms of
member countries', by which an 'illusion of inclusion' is
created.[41](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-21780-8_10#FPar1) He
argues that, in order to be included or their views listened to,
Indigenous delegates at the UN must mimic the strategies, language,
norms and modes of behaviour of member states and international
institutions. Corntassel finds that 'what results is a cadre of
professionalized Indigenous delegates who demonstrate more allegiance to
the UN system than to their own
communities'.[42](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-21780-8_10#FPar1) In
his final analysis, he charges that the co-optation of international
Indigenous political actors is highly 'effective in challenging the
unity of the global Indigenous rights movement and hindering genuine
dialogue regarding Indigenous self-determination and
justice'.[43](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-21780-8_10#FPar1)

### Other Theory Cards

#### Sweeping theories of radical indigenous ontological difference ignore the [nuances]{.underline} of [actual struggles]{.underline} that [strategically repurpose settler categories]{.underline} 

**Rosenow, 19**---Senior Lecturer in International Relations at Oxford
Brookes University (Doerthe, "Decolonising the Decolonisers? Of
Ontological Encounters in the GMO Controversy and Beyond," Global
Society, 33:1, 82-99, dml)

Despite the force and importance of this argument, I have felt slightly
uneasy when reading those conclusions. [[Focusing on **radical
ontological difference**]{.mark} can **easily [lead]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} a **romanticised [reification]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} other
peoples' [difference]{.mark} that is **[in danger of ignoring
actual]{.mark} political [struggles]{.mark}** [and **demands on the
ground**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Cusicanqui argues, [[those]{.mark}
struggles **[might]{.mark} very well [emerge]{.mark}** [out of an
"**indigenous modernity**", **rather than**]{.mark} **an
[insistence]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} the **right to one's
[difference]{.mark}**]{.underline}. By this she means that [[some
Indigenous people]{.mark} aim to **[formulate a hegemonic
vision]{.mark}** for how to structure a society that is **[valid for
everyone]{.mark}** (Indigenous **AND** non-Indigenous)]{.underline}:
they work for a society that is in their "image and likeness",
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[**use modern notions** such as
"**citizenship**"]{.mark} for this purpose, [rather than
**rejecting**]{.mark} **the latter [as irreconcilable]{.mark} with one's
own world**]{.underline}.39 By contrast, [some]{.underline} North
American Indigenous [intellectuals call for an Indigenous
"**resurgence**" that, **rather than seeking hegemony**, altogether
**turns away from seeking recognition** by wider (colonial)
"society"]{.underline}. As Leanne Betasamosake Simpson points out, [in
such "resurgent mobilization ... there is **virtually no room for white
people**".]{.underline} 40

But my unease was also emerging from something else, which is what I
want to focus on in this article: the problem that encounters and
conflicts are yet again made sense of within overarching structures of
knowledge production rather than cultivation (despite the intention to
do otherwise). As de la Cadena herself makes clear in the quotation
above, what is encountered as "different" is inevitably described "in
forms that I could understand" (my emphasis)---even whilst
simultaneously recognising that one's description does not capture what
the encountered practices actually do. Sense-making, for de la Cadena,
takes place at what could be called two levels: At a first level, there
is the inevitable process of making sense of an alienating affective
experience on the spot, from within one's own framework of understanding
the world. At a second level, then, de la Cadena attempts to make
legible her grappling and not-understanding in the context of a book for
an academically literate and interested audience---in other words, in
the writing-up of her ethnographic research.

In Rojas' and Blaney and Tickner's case, given that their articles do
not aim to make an empirical contribution, sense-making takes place at
what could be called a third level: what is drawn upon is the
understanding that emerged out of the ethnographic work of others, which
is brought into conversation with various bodies of theoretical work in
order to make a conceptual contribution. This takes place via the
coining of central concepts and the outlining of all-encompassing
frameworks that are meant to help us understand the analytical,
normative and political consequences of their argument for scholarly
work more broadly. The ontological encounters of others are used to
delineate the merits of ontological encounters in general, in IR and
beyond. This objective leads to a particular way of developing and
structuring a generic argument that makes it difficult to move beyond
sense-making frameworks that are necessarily geared towards settling all
those unsettling and disconcerting experiences that were the focus of
the articles in the first place.

[This is]{.underline} also [the problem of some **central decolonial
work**]{.underline}. Drawing on Edouard Glissant, Mignolo, for example,
critiques the "requirement of transparency" that forms the basis for
understanding in Western social science scholarship. He argues for [the
"**right to opacity**" of those located on the **other side of the
colonial difference**]{.underline}.41 But this claim sits at odds with
his simultaneous desire to write a new, all-encompassing history of "the
modern/colonial world system". 42 And like in Rojas' and Blaney and
Tickner's articles, terms such as "pluriversality"43 or "diversality"44
[are coined in order to have a (**one!**) concept for a **similarly
all-encompassing solution** to domination]{.underline}. While de la
Cadena is critical of her own "anxiety to understand coherently (with
which I meant clearly and without contradiction"), and while she points
out how [this]{.underline} "was often out of place", 45 Mignolo as well
as Rojas and Blaney and Tickner [seek to place]{.underline} such
[anxiety in **yet another coherent framework** that **holds everything
together**]{.underline}.

The question arises whether this can be any different in scholarly work
that is not directly based on ethnographic research itself, and which
can therefore not lay claim to a direct experience of ontological
controversies. This has become an important question for my own
(likewise third-level) work on anti-GMO activism. My work to date has
primarily aimed at making a conceptual contribution, and has relied on a
conversation between the ethnographic research of others and various
bodies of conceptual work, including decolonial and "ontological turn"
literature.46

But as I have already indicated in relation to de la Cadena's work, when
writing up their research for academic purposes, even those who have
directly experienced ontological encounters find it hard to resist the
tendency to conclude their work with stringent, overarching, coherent
conclusions that the Westerneducated reader can grasp and "take home".
In the next section, I will draw on two anthropological ethnographic
texts that are significant for research on the GMO controversy to show
how this works. The two texts that will be analysed in the next section
engage with the GMO controversy in Paraguay and Mexico respectively, and
they have stood out for me in the way they manage to convey a sense of
unease and grappling with ontological encounters and conflicts. However,
as the next section will show, they as well end up providing a framework
and conclusions that can accommodate and make sense of the encountered
ontological difference.

3\. Ontological Encounters in the GMO Controversy

According to Susana Carro-Ripalda and Marta Astier, much of the research
that is carried out in relation to the question of what smallholder
producers in the Global South truly think of (and say about)
agricultural biotechnology is unable to grasp the "ontological
incompatibility" that exists between the experienced human/nonhuman
relations in small-scale agriculture on the one hand, and the logic that
underlies genetic engineering (GE) on the other.47 This is precisely
because most social research is itself grounded in the crucial
modern/colonial nature-culture divide: the former can only be known
through scientific means, while the latter can be known through the
study of social/cultural/political practices. Knowledge about nature is
about establishing "facts", which are either true or false (i.e. nature
as "one" is either correctly or incorrectly represented), while
knowledge about culture is about studying meaning, which is necessarily
(due to the existence of different cultures) multiple.

The question of whether GMOs do or do not pose a "factual" danger
consequently lies outside of the remit of the social sciences, which
therefore focus on the social dimension of statements that are made
about nature. But as Kregg Hetherington's reflections on his own
anthropological research journey in Paraguay make clear, this tacit
signing-up to modern ontology can lead to difficulties in understanding
the reality of the people one is interested in.48 Coming from a position
in which he took for granted the scientific distinction between (proven)
"fact" and "error", Hetherington explains how he "translate\[d\]" the
claims of the leader of a local peasant movement49 (Antonio) about the
truth of (GM) soy "killer beans" into something else:

Until this point, I had approached ethnography as an extended discussion
with and about humans, and I was less interested in beans than I was
with what Antonio said about them ... To be blunt, Antonio kept pointing
at the beans, and I kept looking at him ... I was comfortable saying
that this was a figure of speech, a kind of political rhetoric, or even
to claim that this is what Antonio believed, all of which explicitly
framed 'la soja mata' (soy kills) as data for social analysis, rather
than analysis itself worthy of response.50

However, Hetherington points out that not believing in the truth of the
killer bean did not prevent him from "participating in Antonio's
knowledge practices". 51 Becoming involved in the anti-soy bean activism
of the peasants, Hetherington became "part of the situation" that made
the killer bean turn into a crucial agent in a court case that was
brought against two soy farmers for the murder of two activist peasants.
As a result, killer beans became transformed into a matter of national
concern. Crucially for Hetherington, participation involved more than
joining the situation in spite of his lack of belief: it led to him
becoming immersed in a relation with both peasants and beans that
started to have a physical impact on him---in de la Cadena's words, he
indeed became "partially connected": 52

Beans didn't scare me at first. Indeed, as a foreigner to the situation
that gives rise to killer beans (a Canadian no less), giant fields of
soy were a familiar, even a comforting sight. But it took only a few
months with Antonio for me to start feeling the menace from those
fields. Soon, the sweetish smell of glyphosate, recently applied, and
especially the corpselike smell of 2, 4-D mixed with Tordon, could ruin
my appetite and make me expect to see people emerge from their homes to
show me pustules on their legs and stomachs.53

Similar observations are also found in Carro-Ripalda and Astier's
contribution to the 2014 Agriculture and Human Values symposium on the
challenges of making smallholder producer voices being heard in relation
to agricultural biotechnology.54 While most of the contributions to the
symposium concentrate on how to tease out smallholders' "real" voices in
the most effective way, Carro-Ripalda and Astier critically reflect on
their own perceived failure to become knowledgeable about smallholders'
voices in their research on GM maize cultivation in Mexico.

It was through ethnographic fieldwork in rural areas in Central Mexico,
in-depth structured interviews, focus groups, participant observation
and, finally, a National Workshop in Mexico City with over 50
stakeholders (including smallholder producers) that Carro-Ripalda and
Astier attempted to get a better sense of what the actual voices of
peasants in the GM controversy were trying to convey.55 However,
particularly the final workshop, which aimed to create conditions under
which Mexican smallholder producers could speak on their own terms about
GM maize cultivation, "unwittingly reproduced the conditions of
exclusive, techno-scientific and regulatory spaces". 56 The public
discourse that centres on questions of safety, science, possibilities of
regulation and problems of potential contamination, and which is upheld
by both GM maize proponents and antiGMO activists, dominated the
workshop debate. Even when present smallholders raised different
concerns, the discussion always returned to the previous, main ones, as
if those who had spoken differently "had not spoken at all". The way
that smallholders could articulate "their perceptions, ideas, and
desires" was thereby "severely limited". 57

Carro-Ripalda and Astier are focused on the dominance of one particular
(techno-scientific, regulatory) discourse that, they maintain, disabled
smallholder voices engaged in different discourses from speaking up or,
when speaking, from being heard. In other words, smallholders were
unable to adequately represent their own understanding of what is at
stake in the GM maize controversy in Mexico. Considering what I have
pointed out in the previous section, based on Rojas, difference is
thereby transformed into an epistemological, rather than an ontological
one: Carro-Ripalda and Astier's argument is implicitly based on the
assumption that, under the right conditions, difference can be
translated into something that can be communicated to, and discussed
with, other stakeholders. But the term "ontological incompatibility"
that the authors themselves use indicates there is something else at
play, which cannot easily be translated: the nature of the relation of
smallholder producers to their "land, seed, crop, climate ... as told
and understood by themselves"; the "central place" that Maize continues
to occupy in Mesoamerican pre-Hispanic cosmology, and "the social and
cultural significance" that goes along with that.58

Carro-Ripalda and Astier's emphasis on the problem of the dominant
discourse, and the overarching Mexican structures of domination this
discourse is related to (such as the "neoliberal vision of the Mexican
agricultural future"59), makes it occasionally difficult to understand
what the problem of "ontological incompatibility" really is about. At
the end of the article, the place of the smallholder producers whom they
have engaged seems once again clearly delineated and knowable: at stake
for smallholders are, Carro-Ripalda and Astier argue, "their lives as
maize cultivators, their pride in their craft and knowledge, and their
ceremonially demanded right to information, choice and access to their
'own resources'". It is not just about "retaining 'traditional' ways of
agriculture", as the anti-GMO movement maintains, but also about
claiming "political, economic and socio-cultural rights."60 Though this
certainly adds a significant dimension to the debate, it indeed simply
seems to add to, rather than radically challenge, the frameworks that
are conventionally used in the anti-GMO debate, as well as the
frameworks that focus on how to bring out and represent other people's
"voices" in a better way. Is this simply unavoidable when it comes to
the production of academic knowledge through/in academic writing? As
already indicated in the previous section, academic writing pursues by
definition the objective of enhancing knowledge and providing improved
insight into a certain situation. In its very structure, an academic
piece of work aims to resolve and settle, rather than to dislocate, to
destabilise, or to provide discomfort.

Carro-Ripalda and Astier's article is meant to render legible their own
encounter of ontological difference for an academic audience. Is it
possible for the reader to dig below these representational strategies,
and to relate more directly to their encounter of what they themselves
call ontological incompatibility? And which has led them to brand their
final workshop, in a quite un-academic way, as a "failure"? There are a
few places in the article in which their inability to put into words and
arguments all of "the complexity of experiences, relations and reasons
that bind people to maize"61 is more obvious. Becoming attuned to this
complexity is linked to the authors having to become at least "partially
connected"---to yet again use de la Cadena's phrase---to the relations
they attempt to trace. It is interesting, for example, that
Carro-Ripalda and Astier talk about "voices" as going beyond the
semantic level, as conveying something acoustically, and as requiring a
form of listening that shies away from asking pre-given questions. It is
also interesting that some of that took place when they literally walked
together with their interlocutors; precisely as it is emphasised by
Blaney and Tickner:62

Despite the shortcomings of the workshop ... we felt that that, through
our research on the ground, we had engaged with male and female farmers,
heard about their perspectives on GM and their visions of a rural
future, and accompanied them to work in milpas and markets. So, what do
smallholder farmers' voices sound like? What meanings did they convey to
us? We will provide here but a few of those sounds and meanings ... 63

Despite returning to the idea of voices as conveying "meaning" in this
quote, meaning is related to sounds, to walking together, to particular
places with their own sounds, smells, and colours. The sample of actual
"voices" Carro-Ripalda and Astier then choose to present yet again
invoke an intricate sense of the relationality of farmers and nonhumans:

It is a joy to plant, getting hold of the maize, of a beautiful cob
which is pleasant, to go to the harvest, to look at pretty cobs, all
regular. Because this is what sustains me.

You can see the difference in the seeds straight away ... You need to
look at the cob and as soon as I grab it I see the difference.

It is the person who knows the seed the one who chooses it \[for
replanting the following year\].64

By contrast, GM maize is associated by the smallholders whom
Carro-Ripalda and Astier cite with feelings of "artificiality,
estrangement and distrust towards the created object (the GMO) in
itself, not only because of deep ontological considerations ... but
because of the political and economic motives which are 'assembled' into
it."65 Although the authors make a distinction between ontology and
politics/ economics here, their invoking of the "assemblage" precisely
shows how the latter becomes part of ontology itself, and then (as in
the case of Hetherington) impacts on the sensual, bodily connection with
the maize. Understanding the relation between "things" in this way
allows for an analysis of power and domination that has at least the
potential of moving beyond pre-given frameworks; strategically
suspending them in order to "sharpen \[the\] analysis of exactly how
power operates, how relations are made and undermined, and with what
consequences". 66 Genetically modified maize is a problem because it is
part of particular Mexican neoliberal visions and strategies, but in the
context outlined by Carro-Ripalda and Astier, that vision is not only
(and not even primarily) made sense of through given frames of
knowledge, such as Marxist theories of the exploitation of labour, but
sensually, through the way it disrupts the (physical) pleasure and joy
that has sustained the farmer-maize-assemblage so far.67 GM technology
externalises the maize from farmers and estrange them from their ways of
life; and it is only through this externalisation that GM maize becomes
perceivable as a potential source of "contamination", as a danger
against which farmers need to "defend" their seeds.68

Now, some might counter that the previous paragraph in practice only
provides a fancy repackaging of the two well-rehearsed arguments brought
forward by many anti-GMO activists: (a) that the problem of GMOs is an
intrinsic property that makes it "unsafe" (which activists try to
scientifically prove), and/or (b) that the fundamental problem of
agricultural biotechnology is that it estranges farmers from their
traditional, ancestral way of life, that it allows for their
exploitation, and that it provides a further foothold for neoliberal
visions of how the world should be ordered. Both arguments are grounded
in modern ontology: the first goes down the route of science (contesting
"facts" about the "nature" of GMOs on the basis of science itself),
while the second goes down the "social" route by either making a case
for the need to respect cultural multiplicity, or for the need to
prevent economic exploitation. Some activists make use of all of these
routes and arguments. Famous environmental activist and intellectual
Vandana Shiva, for example, determines the alienating character of the
GMO to be an intrinsic property, while at the same time depicting
smallholder producers as intrinsic "'reservoirs' of local or indigenous
knowledge or as 'natural' conservators of biodiversity through their
traditional practices". 69 According to Carro-Ripalda and Astier, this
"unwittingly reinforce\[es\] images of smallholder producers as passive,
timeless and voiceless."70 This leads to precisely the sort of
romanticised reification of "difference" that I have critiqued in the
previous section of this article---paradoxically, in this case, on the
basis of an ontology that is deeply modern, as it regards both "things"
and "people" as ontologically stable and classifiable.

By contrast, the authors of the two texts I have analysed in this
section trace ontological encounters that cannot be contained by the
nature/culture dichotomy. There is no pre-given (social) theory of
neoliberalism and global power relations that dictates how the "voice"
of the farmer needs to be made sense of. There is also no pregiven
understanding of the "factual" (scientific) nature of GMOs. The notion
of radical difference that comes up in these two texts emerged from
precisely the "misunderstandings" that the encounter of ethnographers
with "other people" and their relations brought to the fore; but
importantly, it did not make any clearer to the ethnographer what the
"stuff" that grounded the misunderstandings is actually composed of.71
Yet, somewhat paradoxically, despite all this emphasis on
misunderstandings, incompatibility, grappling, failure, and critical
self-reflection of one's own assumptions---at the end of the day what is
left for the readers (at least if they do not explicitly focus on the
"ethnographic excess" found in the writings) is the impression that they
know more about "stuff" than they did before: that they understand the
situation better, that new knowledge has been produced, that the object
of analysis is more transparent than it has been before. How can this
subjugation of the encountered ontologically difference to academic
strategies of comprehensive sense-making avoided (if at all)?

This article itself is now coming up to what would normally be a
conclusion---i.e. the treacherous waters of nailing its contribution to
knowledge. Given that this article is yet again another "third-level"
engagement with questions of ontology and decoloniality, the question is
whether there is any way to avoid this pull of hegemonic modes of
academic knowledge production. Rather than providing a conclusion and
reiterate the core argument that the article has made, I will attempt to
finish this piece by raising even more questions, and by providing some
further reflections.

4\. Turtles all the Way Down: (Further) Reflections on What Questions to
Ask

The pull of hegemonic systems of academic knowledge production is
difficult to avoid. This is the case even in writings that are directly
based on ontological encounters and controversies, and that reflect on
the displacement that encountering different ontologies has entailed.
But as I have indicated, this problem is even more pronounced in
writings---like my own---that provide what I have previously called
"third-level" sense-making of ontological encounters.

The contribution of third-level analysis is usually a conceptual one,
which makes it by definition veer towards the general and abstract
rather than the concrete. In relation to the literature on decolonial
thought and the ontological turn, this becomes manifest in three
different (yet interrelated) ways: first, in the desire to provide an
understanding of ontology that enables a conceptualisation of the former
as multiple. Drawing on the work of Mario Blaser and Eduardo Viveiros de
Castro respectively, Rojas and Blaney and Tickner argue that ontology
can be thought of as multiple if reality is understood as always being
"enacted" or "performed". 72 This is what Blaser calls an understanding
of ontology as "materialsemiotic": one that defines reality as "always
in the making through the dynamic relations of hybrid assemblages". 73
Pinpointing it like this is inevitably geared towards answering the
question of what reality as such, in general is about. Secondly, there
is an ambition to coin the general normative-political project that
arises out of this understanding with a singular concept, such as the
pluriverse. Thirdly, arguments about ontological multiplicity and the
emancipatory-decolonial political projects that arise out of its
recognition are written for an audience of a particular discipline, such
as IR: the aim is to provide a wholesale, general rethinking, or,
indeed, "reconstruction" of the latter.74

What sort of questions drive conceptual work into that direction, and
what desire "to know" underlies the questions? According to Cherokee
philosopher Brian Yazzie Burkhart, for Native Americans "the questions
we choose to ask are more important than any truths we might hope to
discover in asking such questions". 75 By contrast, Western knowledge is
always (at least in the mainstream) propositional knowledge: "knowledge
of the form 'that something is so'". Here, knowledge cannot be verified
by referring to direct experiences: "there must be something underlying
them and justifying them". 76 Burkhart gives the example of the "routine
response" given by "Western people" to Indigenous accounts of creation:
"In \[one\] account, the earth rests on the back of a turtle. The
Western response to this account is simply the question, 'What holds the
turtle?'" This question makes no sense to the Native storyteller,
because the truth of the story lies in the paths to rightful action that
it outlines, rather than what it has to say about the "reality" of the
world. But when the Westerner insists on the question, the answer
finally is: "'Well, then there must be turtles all the way down'."77

Equating Rojas' and Blaney and Tickner's work with European mainstream
(hence analytic) philosophy seems, at first glance, incredibly unfair.
After all, those authors precisely advocate the cultivating of knowledge
by direct awareness or acquaintance in exactly the way that Burkhart
identifies as typical for Native Americans. But on the other hand, the
framework that circumscribes their emphasis on the need for
"concreteness" is still an abstract one that wants to answer the
question of how things really are and should be: enacted, performed,
pluriversal, ... The point is not whether this argument about reality
and politics is right or wrong. The point is to recognise that it is
driven by particular questions that might make no sense in the context
of other intelligence systems, but that need to be addressed in an
academic article in order to make a conceptual argument compelling,
convincing and original for an audience that primarily sits (whether it
likes it or not) within a Western, colonial, hegemonic system of
knowledge production.78 And even when the contribution to knowledge
production is not primarily conceptual, as in the "second-level" work
that I have analysed in the previous section in relation to the GMO
controversy, the final argument that is made (e.g. about peasants'
economic and cultural rights) is yet again lucid and comprehensible to
an audience that seeks to comprehend "stuff" within modern parameters.

Where to go from here (particularly as a white, European scholar)? As
suggested by Tucker, one way might be to engage in much more direct,
ethnographic research, which would enable more direct experience of
ontological encounters. Despite previously-mentioned problems of even
that research not going far enough, there is without doubt more space
for providing a sense of grappling and dislocation if the originality of
a piece of work is not purely grounded in the conceptual contribution it
aims to make. However, not every scholar is able--- body-, context- or
funding-wise---to spend extensive periods of time in different places,
and the ethical and political pitfalls of researching "radical
difference" through fieldwork with---but often rather on---others have
been pointed out by Indigenous scholars numerous times.79

But even for those unable or unwilling to do more primary, empirical
research, there is space to push the boundaries of what can and should
be written about (and how). For decades there have been attempts to
provide "innovative" platforms, for example at conferences, to talk
about "stuff" in different ways (e.g. through storytelling or artistic
practices; not at least by e.g. Indigenous peoples themselves80).
However, these "innovations" are still at the margins, and they will
most likely never be able to compete with acknowledged knowledge
production outlets such as journal articles and scholarly books. But
even within the latter, there is always at least some space to push for
more open-endedness, more reflection on the author's embodied
positionality, more auto-critique, more uncertainty and grappling (even
if this is based on reading about the ontological encounters of others).

Although this sort of embodied self-reflection on a writer's
"situatedness" (which in my own case means being "on the colonising side
of a divide"81) has obviously been advanced by many critical scholars
for decades (including feminists and post- as well as decolonial
scholars), this article has hopefully shown that [there is still
(**always**) a **need to go further**, in order to **more fundamentally
challenge hegemonic**, **modern/colonial modes** of knowledge
production]{.underline}. The sense of unease that I have outlined in
section two was particularly strong when reading conclusions that were
geared towards making recommendations for the discipline of IR, or for
"international politics", as such. [[Aiming to **make generic
conclusions for** ]{.mark}**entire disciplines**, **political fields**,
or [global "**issues**" **pushes**]{.mark} **the generality** and
**[abstraction]{.mark}** of a contribution **even [further
away]{.mark}** [from an **advocacy of the
concrete**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Why, and to whom, does it matter
whether IR, as a discipline, or international politics, as object of
study, becomes more pluriversal or not? What are the actual benefits of
the concept of the pluriverse in the first place? Or to pick up the
theme of this special issue: why does it matter whether IR is, or should
move into, a mode of affirmation rather than critique?82 Why is this a
good question to ask---and for whom? [[This]{.mark} is **not just a
theoretical problem**, but it [has **real-life consequences for
actually-existing decolonial struggles**. The desire for **making a
generic argument** about relational ontologies]{.mark} and a pluriversal
politics [**harbours the danger of making a huge variety of demands**
and **struggles**]{.mark} **that often exist [in tension]{.mark}** and
**contradiction** [with each other
**commensurable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indigenous demands for the
repatriation of "their" land might be at odds with the social justice
demands for redistribution and "the commons". 83 For Blaney and Tickner,
decolonial thought is commensurable with not just the ontological turn
literature, but also feminist and other critical interventions.84
Mignolo and Arturo Escobar advocate a transnational fight for global
justice and are enthusiastic about the potential of global movements to
achieve that aim together.85 Like Mignolo, Rojas explicitly draws on the
World Social Forum slogan "Another world is possible" as well as the
Zapatistas slogan of "a world where many words fit" to make her case
about the need for a pluriversal understanding of
emancipatory-decolonial politics.86 [While]{.underline} it can be argued
that [[this]{.mark} problem of **seeing all these struggles** and
**demands as commensurable** [goes back to a **lack of actual engagement
with particular** ]{.mark}**decolonial [practices]{.mark}** and
**battles**]{.underline}, what I have argued in this article is that
[[it is also related to]{.mark} the problem of **how** and [**what sort
of knowledge is produced** and **valued** in the Western academy:
knowledge that is **abstract**, **generic**, and **applicable beyond a
specific context**]{.mark}. Knowledge that is **driven** by the desire
to **know what is**.]{.underline} Knowledge that desires to know what
holds the turtle---all the way down.

#### Re-empowerment is [possible specifically]{.underline} in the Arctic, even if US policy was [initially colonial]{.underline} in the Arctic or continues to be elsewhere. Engagement now is becoming [reconciliatory]{.underline} and [offsets previous abuses]{.underline} of power.

This complexity is highlighted in Mark Nuttall's research on the
co-management of Arctic oil and gas resources in Alaska and the Canadian
Arctic (Nuttall, 2008), including his detailed study of two generations
of oil and gas comanagement in the Mackenzie River Valley, as well as
Claudia Notzke's earlier pioneering research on resource co-management
across Canada (Notzke, 1995), which chronicles both the proliferation
and increasing saliency of co-management as a governing principle for
natural resource management, even in regions without settled land
claims. Indeed, [[so **well-suited** is co-management to
**resource-rich**]{.mark} **frontier [regions]{.mark}**, [it]{.mark} has
been **decoupled from the land claims process**, finding its way into
resource-rich parts of Canada's settled southern provinces where
competing claims to the land have [precluded **successful**]{.mark}
**negotiation of [land claims]{.mark},**]{.underline} becoming a salient
microlevel of analysis independent of land claims settlement -- as
evident in the emergence of "strategic comanagement" systems designed
for "cooperative environmental management" of natural resource-rich
area, yielding stand-alone co-management bodies in areas of southern
Canada without settled land claims. (Notzke, 1995) And Derek Armitage et
al.\'s 2011 study of co-management in the Canadian Arctic demonstrates
how [[comanagement]{.mark} provides a mechanism [for]{.mark} both
[Natives and governments to]{.mark} learn **how [to be
adaptive]{.mark}** amidst \"uncertainty and environmental
change,\"]{.underline} and thus to benefit from social learning for
developing adaptive capacity for resolving complex challenges
collaboratively, [resulting in new levels of knowledge co-production
[that]{.mark} successfully **[synthesize indigenous and western
approaches]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- introducing a \"collaborative
process to bring together a plurality of knowledge sources\"
[[that]{.mark} both **[reconciles asymmetries in power]{.mark}** and
overcomes the many complexities of multilevel governance.]{.underline}

8\. The Globalization of Co-Management

Armitage's earlier 2007 co-edited volume (with Berkes and Doubleday) on
adaptive co-management, institutional learning, and multi-level
governance illustrates the globalization and universalization of
comanagement far beyond the Arctic region. Its case studies include
northern examples of co-management from Alaska, Yukon, NWT and Nunavut
as might be expected, as well as case studies of co-management in places
as diverse as Vancouver Island, Southern Ontario and Atlantic Canada in
Canada\'s southern provinces; in addition to Wisconsin in the United
States; Belize, Barbados, and Granada in the Central America/Caribbean
region; and Sweden in Europe. Indeed, co-management has truly gone
global.

Former Yukon Premier Tony Penikett has observed that Native treaties in
Canada are themselves "inherently international because natives are
transnational," even if governments in North America still view Natives
as "domesticated" components of their constitutional polities. To
Penikett, [land claims treaties and the many [comanagement]{.mark}
structures they [yielded]{.mark} are "**[remarkable nation-building
achievements]{.mark}**," helping [to **offset earlier
colonial**]{.mark}**-era [treaties]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the "historic
[failures]{.mark} [of]{.mark} colonizing [states to respect]{.mark}
their treaty [promises]{.mark}."]{.underline} (Penikett, 2014) Looking
to the future, [[as]{.mark} the polar thaw drives continuing Arctic
globalization, and [non-Arctic states show increasing interest]{.mark}
in Arctic]{.underline} lands, waters and resources, [[the]{.mark}
strategic [center]{.mark} of mass [for engaging]{.mark} in Arctic
enterprises of all sorts [will b]{.mark}e the myriad
**[co-management]{.mark} structures**]{.underline} that define the
post-land claims political topography of Arctic North America.

Just as co-management strives to institutionalize the dynamic balancing
of competing traditional and modern values, and of tribal and state
powers, it could establish a foundation for the diplomatic balancing of
Arctic interests and non-Arctic interests alike. Co-management can thus
form a vital nexus at the very heart of Arctic globalization.
[[Co-management introduces a **collaborative**]{.mark}
**decision-making** [process]{.mark} that is at heart adaptive, and as
such is well-suited to the arrival of new actors on the Arctic stage
with values, interests, and capabilities that may differ profoundly from
their local, regional and indigenous counterparts.]{.underline} Just as
[co-management has successfully]{.underline} (but not always
frictionlessly) [[negotiated an]{.mark} [**equilibrium** between]{.mark}
contending **[traditional and contemporary
values]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and between tribal and state interests,
[[it]{.mark} could [serve]{.mark} not only [as]{.mark} a metaphor, but
[an **institutional foundation**]{.mark}, for the management of the
emergent state competition gathering steam in the Arctic.]{.underline}

9\. An End to Arctic Exceptionalism?

While the post-Cold War Arctic has been marked by a spirit of
collaboration between multiple levels of stakeholders, whether
indigenous peoples, states, or transnational organizations, [this
collaboration has taken root [at a **unique historical
moment**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- one [[defined]{.mark} as much
[by]{.mark} the dramatic **[decline in]{.mark} international
[tension]{.mark}** and inter-bloc state rivalry that followed the end of
the Cold War]{.underline} and the largely peaceful breakup of the Soviet
Union into independent states as by the historic reconciliation between
tribe and state in the Arctic region, especially Arctic North America,
after the nearly half-century long process of land claims negotiation,
structural innovation, political devolution, and implementation of
co-management systems across the entirety of Arctic North America --
with the region buffered from external stressors by the remoteness and
harshness of Arctic climate and geography.

[Even [as war erupted in other]{.mark} ethnically complex
[regions]{.mark} such as the Balkan Peninsula, and throughout the Middle
East, Africa and South Asia where tribal dynamics greatly influence
political stability, **[calm prevailed in the
Arctic]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The causal ambiguity inherent in the
concept of "Arctic Exceptionalism" is rooted in the inability of
separating this protracted period of circumpolar peace and stability
from these historic events and processes, or from the region's distinct
geography and climate. Thus, the state of ["[Arctic
Exceptionalism]{.mark}" may not be an inherent "default" condition of
Arctic international relations but one that [has arisen in lockstep with
its **historical**]{.mark} **and strategic [context,]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} one that **[can evaporate]{.mark}** as historical trends
and the strategic environment transform.]{.underline}

Add to this the many complexities of the Arctic's geophysical
transformation catalyzed by climate change, which may introduce myriad
stressors to disrupt the Arctic calm, one may reasonably look to the
future with new caution and concern.

[A comparative look at [U.S]{.mark}. Arctic [strategy]{.mark} during the
post-Cold War period [shows]{.mark} a [continuous]{.mark}, unbroken
chain of official documents committed to **[collaborative]{.mark},
multilateral [Arctic engagement]{.mark}**, in partnership **[with Arctic
indigenous peoples]{.mark}** and states]{.underline} (including Russia,
with which the U.S. directly aligned its interests at the May 28, 2008
Arctic Ocean Conference in Ilulissat, Greenland, as reflected in the
Ilulissat Declaration uniting the interests of the Arctic 5 (A5)
littoral states, and embracing the Law of the Sea Convention (LOSC) as
the guiding mechanism for Arctic Ocean management). This is evident in
the Clinton Administration's Arctic policy (as articulated by
Presidential Decision Directive/NSC-26 issued on June 9, 1994) as well
as the Bush Administration's update, as articulated in National Security
Presidential Directive (NSPD-66) on January 9, 2009, and again in the
Obama Administration's National Strategy for the Arctic Region (NSAR)
issued on May 10, 2013. Over two decades spanning the collapse of the
Soviet Union and the re-emergence of a sovereign Russian state, and the
eruption of the Global War on Terror, and well into the acceleration of
a polar thaw, regardless of ruling political party, American Arctic
strategy remained at heart collaborative and multilateral.

But in the years that followed the release of NSAR, global interest in
the Arctic greatly intensified, and in response the Arctic Council
opened its doors to a wide range of non-Arctic states as official
observers of the Council, with indirect opportunities to participate
through partnership with Arctic Council members. The increased
complexity of world politics, and in Arctic international relations, and
the assertion of interests in and through the Arctic by non-Arctic
states, combined with a strategic re-assessment of Russian military
ambitions in world politics, began to shake the very foundations of
Arctic Exceptionalism. This precipitated a re-assessment of American
strategic policy with regard to the Arctic region, and a questioning of
the very foundation of Arctic Exceptionalism. This became evident in the
December 2016 Report to Congress on Strategy to Protect United States
National Security Interests in the Arctic Region, and has again been
reflected by the updated United States Coast Guard Arctic Strategic
Outlook, released in April 2019, where dual concerns with both Russian
and Chinese Arctic ambitions cast a long shadow over the collaborative
spirit that infused preceding strategy documents. Arctic collaboration
and cooperation is still a guiding principle, but it is framed more by
alliances and military partnerships than by a presumed universality of
inherent Arctic collaboration10. Embracing the 'Shared Space' of
Co-Management in International RelationsLooking forward, it appears we
are at a crossroads: there is still every opportunity for the Arctic to
remain a zone of international peace and cooperation, so long as the
many stakeholders in the Arctic continue to work collaboratively, and to
find ways to align their interests. But there is also the specter of the
re-emergence of a new Arctic Cold War, should such a collaboration prove
incompatible with the future actions of the many states vying for Arctic
influence and involvement. Whether the path forward is continued
exceptionalism or a collapse in the peaceful Arctic order depends much
on the willingness of new Arctic stakeholders to uphold the
collaborative commitments embraced by the Arctic states and the
indigenous peoples of the Arctic, and which established trust and
cooperation through the creation of joint-governing mechanisms, such as
the many comanagement regimes established after land claims were
settled.An interesting barometer of this will be whether the new Arctic
stakeholders engage respectfully with the comanagement system. While the
Arctic Council's member states and indigenous permanent participants
reflect, to a large measure, the original parties to the co-management
process that took root in the Arctic after land claims were settled,
recent years have witnessed the proliferation of observer states that
now participate in Council meetings from well outside the Arctic,
including the industrialized maritime states of Asia with domestic
markets hungry for natural resources, shipping companies that can
benefit from emergent Arctic sea lanes, and the technological
capabilities needed for Arctic resource and infrastructure development.
There is much potential for North-South partnerships as Arctic
globalization continues; but in order to proceed, knowledge of and
respect for these many localized systems of co-management is essential.

[By **[embracing co-management]{.mark}**, and navigating the complex
administrative landscape of the post-land claims Arctic with humility
and respect, non-Arctic states will [find **enthusiastic partners** in
villages]{.mark} from one end of the Arctic to the other, [and]{.mark}
through the **[mutual]{.mark}ity of [collaboration]{.mark}**[,
enjoy]{.mark}]{.underline} the reciprocity of what Snook, Cunsolo, and
Dale (2018) call [the "**[shared space]{.mark}**" of
co-management.]{.underline} [This will [**build trust**, and
**smooth**]{.mark} **[relations]{.mark}** not only with native
communities and local levels of governance, but the federal agencies and
departments that participate equally in the co-management
process.]{.underline} But it is important to remember that Arctic
co-management has been around for nearly half a century, and that local
stakeholders are deeply committed to the comanagement process. [They not
only sit at the table: [**they built the table at which they
sit**,]{.mark} having negotiated for many years, sometimes decades, [in
a]{.mark}n [historic process of **re-empowerment of indigenous
peoples**]{.mark} across the Arctic.]{.underline} Just as non-Arctic
observers at the Arctic Council sit around the table but not at it, a
place at the comanagement table is earned through trust and mutual
respect. Remembering this can unlock unimagined opportunities for mutual
gain and prosperity. Forgetting this, however, could result in a missed
opportunity of equal magnitude, and plant the seeds for what could
become a new Cold War at the top of the world.

## Topicality 

#### Interpretation: [Topical definitions]{.underline} establish the burdens of [proof]{.underline} and [rejoinder]{.underline}. "The USFG should" means the federal government must be the [agent]{.underline} of the plan.

**Hiland, 24**---Senior Lecturer in Communication & Media at Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute (Alexander, "Analyzing Debate Topics," *A Short
Guide to Policy Debate*, Chapter 1, pp. 5-7, dml)

In preparing for policy debates, [[topic analysis]{.mark} serves three
**essential** [functions]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
**[first]{.underline}** is [to develop a tentative understanding of what
**specific issues** will be argued by **both sides** of the
topic]{.underline}. The **[second]{.underline}** is [to develop a
**strategy** for how to research the topic]{.underline}, [to **maximize
the likelihood** of being]{.underline} adequately prepared to be
**[competitively successful]{.underline}**. The **[third]{.underline}**
is [[to determine what the]{.mark} **[aff]{.mark}irmative** [must
**demonstrate**]{.mark} to be **true** in order [to **justify the judge
voting for them**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} by
extension [[what the]{.mark} **[neg]{.mark}ative**]{.underline} side
[[will have to **disprove**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

To satisfy the first function, [a debater would be **well served** to
consider]{.underline} two things. The first is [what area of **policy**
is the focus of the resolution]{.underline}. [The easiest
way]{.underline} to make this early determination [is to identify the
relevant]{.underline} "**[[terms of art]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[within
the resolution]{.underline}]{.mark}. [These terms]{.underline} are
typically nouns or verbs that, either singly or frequently in
combination, [[denote something **greater** than]{.underline}]{.mark}
what is found within the dictionary for [[the terms]{.mark} used
**[individually]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [These terms of art]{.underline}
typically are used by the topic committee to [ensure that the resolution
reflects debates taking place **outside** the narrow confines of the
debate community]{.underline}.

To identify terms of art, there are a couple of productive steps that
one should follow. First, consider punctuation, the inclusion of hyphens
or quotation marks are good indicators that a term of art is in use.
Second, [look for **terms** that only seem to make sense in
**conjunction** with each other]{.underline}. Below, we will look at one
example from the 2023--2024 debate season. One more strategy would be to
review the controversy paper submitted for the topic, which often has
research compiled about the terms of art relevant to the controversy.

Using the 2023--2024 debate topic, one example would be the phrase
"nuclear triad." A search of the term from Merriam-Webster would return
no results, but a search that entailed looking for "nuclear" and "triad"
separately would produce results that provide definitions of both words.
The result would be:

Nuclear: 2c(1)

: being a weapon whose destructive power derives from an uncontrolled
nuclear reaction6

Triad: 1

: a union or group of three: TRINITY7

This combination of definitions provided without context might allow
someone familiar with the term to deduce the correct interpretation, but
for those who are less familiar with the term of art, it is not an
especially helpful pair of definitions because it doesn't really provide
much specificity for how those words are used in conjunction.

By contrast, recognizing the term "nuclear triad" as a term of art
allows rather rudimentary searches (for more detail on how to perform
searches, see Chapter 3) to produce much more helpful definitions
contextualized to ongoing debates in the field of nuclear weapons
policy. For example, the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation,
a non-partisan non-profit that advocates for the reduction of nuclear
arsenals,8 defines the "nuclear triad" in the following way,

The U.S. nuclear arsenal comprises thousands of nuclear weapons and
three methods of delivery, sometimes called "legs." Warheads can be
launched from the air via strategic bombers carrying gravity bombs or
cruise missiles, from the sea by submarines holding ballistic missiles,
or from underground silos housing intercontinental ballistic missiles.
Collectively, these delivery methods are referred to as "the Triad."
Currently all three legs of the Triad are being modernized at a cost of
\$494 billion, or about \$50 billion every year from 2019 to 2028.9

This definition, although it carries a suggestion of bias given the
interests of the organization offering the definition and the emphasis
placed on the cost of modernizing the legs of the triad, is much more
helpful because it is contextualized to ongoing debates about what to do
with the triad. To help ensure the validity of the definitions provided
for a term of art, it's always a good idea to find two or three
definitions that are essentially similar to help control for bias.

After identifying terms of art within the resolution to help clarify the
topic [[students would be well served to **grammatically interpret** the
topic]{.mark} in order [to validate their interpretation]{.mark} of how
the topic will be debated]{.underline}. [Although [many]{.mark}
debaters]{.underline} and their coaches [[**ignore** this]{.mark} step
[because they assume]{.mark} the [wording of the topic is **secondary**
to]{.mark} the **[norms]{.mark}** for how]{.underline} collegiate
[debate typically functions]{.underline}, [[those]{.mark} assumptions
[can be **risky**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [especially [where certain
terms]{.mark} might [carry]{.mark} a **[substantial meaning]{.mark}**
for the topic depending on their usage]{.underline}. More importantly,
for those looking to get started debating, this step can be remarkably
productive in understanding how debates tend to play out.

[In the resolution]{.underline} which we will be using, [[the
**object**]{.underline}]{.mark} of the sentence [[is]{.mark} identified
as [the]{.mark}]{.underline} "**[[United States Federal
Government]{.underline}]{.mark}**," which is significant because in
standard English grammar, [[the object]{.mark} of the sentence [has
**agency** to affect the subject]{.mark} of the sentence]{.underline};
[hence]{.underline}, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[F]{.underline}]{.mark}**ederal **[[G]{.underline}]{.mark}**overnment
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} referred to as [[an
**agent**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The verb]{.underline} in the sentence
[is]{.underline} "**[[should]{.underline}]{.mark}** restrict,"
[[indicating]{.mark} that [the agent]{.mark} of the resolution [will be
**obligated**]{.mark}]{.underline} to curtail the subject of the
sentence which is indicated by the determiner "its." The subject of the
sentence is "nuclear forces." The sentence is modified after the subject
by the phrase "one or more" meaning that the affirmative might choose
between multiple options, with a list indicated by "following ways" and
the subsequent colon.

In each of the listed items we have a gerund form of the verb indicating
that where the interpretation of the verb is not clear from the
definition of the word it will be interpreted as a form of the initial
verb in the sentence (restrict). This illustrates why [reading the topic
grammatically is **helpful** because [it]{.mark}]{.underline} clarifies
that the gerund form of the verb beginning each sentence subject to the
term restrict, meaning the affirmative cannot defend an expansion of
nuclear forces.10 Subsequently, each line has a subject noun that [[sets
the **parameters** for what the]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[F]{.underline}]{.mark}**ederal **[[G]{.underline}]{.mark}**overnment
[[can do under]{.mark} the auspices of [the resolution by
**constraining** the number of **subjects**]{.mark} which can be acted
upon]{.underline}.

#### Standards:

#### [LIMITS]{.underline}. State action serves as a [predictable stasis point]{.underline} for debate that guarantees [thematic coherence]{.underline}. Absent [defined limits]{.underline}, debate's competitive incentives create a [race to the margins]{.underline} which [distorts topic research]{.underline}.

#### [GROUND]{.underline}. Our interpretation provides a year's worth of vibrant, in-depth debates over the [controversy]{.underline} of fiated state action. It is [unreasonable to prepare]{.underline} for non-governmental actors or mechanisms with the ground allocated to us by the parameters of the resolution. All 2AC defense to this claim will rely on [concessionary ground]{.underline}, which [isn't a stable basis]{.underline} for a year of debate. 

#### Topicality is a voting issue:

#### [FAIRNESS]{.underline}. Burdening the negative with rejoining non-topical affirmatives is [procedurally unfair]{.underline}. That matters because [both sides]{.underline} expect fair and objective evaluation of their arguments.

#### [CLASH]{.underline}. Non-topical affs encourage [avoidance]{.underline} over [engagement]{.underline} in debates because the aff doesn't have to defend a [controversy]{.underline}. Topicality teaches us to [persuade]{.underline} and to [be persuaded]{.underline} because it [directs]{.underline} debaters towards [engaging]{.underline} each other's arguments in [good faith]{.underline}.

[[While]{.underline}]{.mark} a handful of
[[billionaires]{.underline}]{.mark} can afford to [take]{.underline}
vanity [flights to **space** and]{.underline} pay top dollar for
well-stocked bunkers to [[ride out **climate
catastrophes**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[billions]{.underline}]{.mark} of
people [[live]{.mark} in poverty [on a **collapsing
planet**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [where [**forest fires** rage
and]{.mark}]{.underline} up to one million different [[species]{.mark}
are [on the verge of **extinction**]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[7\] Sensing
opportunity, [those in power have responded to]{.underline} our era's
[calamities by]{.underline} further exploiting regular people's
vulnerabilities, [capitalizing on confusion and resentment]{.underline},
[and scapegoating their victims in order to **deflect blame away** from
themselves]{.underline}. The result is a resurgent global right wing,
beholden to a corporate elite, steeped in misinformation, and unabashed
in their bigotry, with lines of antagonism sharpening around questions
of race, religion, immigration status, gender, sexuality, and more---a
right wing willing, for example, to spend over \$50 million in 2022 on
political advertisements attacking LGBTQ+ people, particularly trans
children, in order to stir up hate and votes, and to performatively bus
immigrants from red states to blue ones, with no concern for their
well-being. \[8\]

Meanwhile, [those who claim to represent the]{.underline} political
[center]{.underline} distinguish themselves by not being as extreme as
this right-wing opposition, but they too [use division in more subtle
ways]{.underline}. For example, [they pursue]{.underline} market-based
solutions that deepen pre-existing social inequities, advocate for
targeted or means-tested government policies that deem some people
"worthy" and others "unworthy" of public assistance, and castigate
activists for being unreasonable when they argue that safe space be made
for members of marginalized groups.\[9\] Whipped along by [a strategy of
**divide** and **conquer**]{.underline}, liberal democracies [the
**world**]{.underline} over [appear to be perpetually teetering on the
edge of social and political **disaster**]{.underline}, with hard-won
social progress being systematically undone.

The premise of this book is simple: [shifting away from this tragic
course requires the conscious cultivation of
**[solidarity]{.mark}**]{.underline}, an understudied concept that must
be reclaimed from the history of social and political thought.
Fundamentally, we understand solidarity as [the recognition of our
**inherent interconnectedness**]{.underline}, an attempt to build bonds
of commonality across our differences. [It [is]{.mark} an **ethos** and
**spur to action** rooted in the [acknowledgment that our lives are
intertwined]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Intertwined]{.underline}, however,
[does [not]{.mark} mean]{.underline}
**[[indistinguishable]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[solidarity depends
on]{.underline} difference, on [recognizing that we are not all exactly
alike but]{.underline} that [we can still **come together** and take
**collective action**]{.underline}. [It is not unity [or
sameness]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[but]{.mark} a way of [**connecting**
with others]{.mark}]{.underline}: [[forging **new
communities**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [developing **[shared
visions]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[and building **power**]{.mark} to push
for social change]{.underline}.

Our actions, policies, and institutions are built on a foundation of
concepts and ideas that too often go overlooked in everyday discourse
and yet have immense influence over our public and private lives.
Solidarity, we believe, is a concept as fundamental to the possibility
of democracy as its sisters, liberty and justice; and it is ever more
relevant as we fight to make our democracy more egalitarian,
sustainable, and pluralistic. But to say that solidarity is the cure to
what ails us is the easy part. The challenge is [acting on this basic
insight and imbuing our social dynamics with a sense of
fellow-feeling]{.underline}. It [is **challenging**]{.underline}, in
part, [because]{.underline} we lack accessible, practical wisdom about
solidarity as a political tradition. Nowhere is this truer than in the
United States, where American [culture emphasizes **individualism** and
**personal freedom**]{.underline} above all. Beyond certain left-
leaning circles where people sign their emails "in solidarity," the
principle rarely appears in mainstream culture or contemporary political
discourse.

And yet, despite being undervalued, solidarity has indelibly shaped the
modern world. In the chapters ahead, we emphasize the role of
[[solidarity]{.underline}]{.mark} in a particular historical and
intellectual tradition that [[stretches back to]{.underline}]{.mark} the
mid- nineteenth century and reaches around the globe, continuing through
post--Civil War **[[Reconstruction]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[labor
movements]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the creation of [the **welfare
state**]{.underline} in Europe and [the **New Deal**]{.underline} in the
United States, **[[postcolonial movements]{.underline}]{.mark}** for
independence, [and into the present day]{.underline}---movements that
have all, in various ways, fought to expand the bounds of democracy. As
this history shows, [solidarity requires **intentional
cultivation**]{.underline}; it is not a spontaneous phenomenon. This has
only been underscored by recent events, including the Covid-19
pandemic---a phenomenon that exposed our interdependence and
vulnerabilities, but that resulted in more distrust and division,
including anti-vaccination protests and anti-Asian violence. In the
words of historian Jack Hayward, today we live amid the "squalid
consequences of liberty without solidarity," born of the very political
bloc Phillips envisioned and animated by what he described as a spirit
of "white anger and counter-solidarity."\[10\]

Historically, the question of solidarity has been raised at times of
massive changes in society, a motif we continue here. Contemporary
conceptions of solidarity first began to take form amid the Industrial
Revolution and the emergence of modern capitalism, and in the wake of
the democratic revolutions of the eighteenth century. As kings were
deposed and the Church's role as a locus of moral authority waned,
philosophers and citizens wondered how society could hang together
without a monarch or god. What could bind people in a modern,
pluralistic, secular age? As we enter a new period of instability and
change, we must ask similar questions today. What can enable us to come
together despite entrenched social divisions and the immense power of
self-interested elites so we can address the crises that threaten us?
And more terrifyingly: What happens if we cannot?

Unfortunately, for people seeking to foster solidarity, there are few
forums or resources to turn to for advice. As we discuss, tremendous
amounts of money and energy have been directed toward suppressing
solidarity and attacking the institutions that incubate it, particularly
labor unions. There is also a notable lack of scholarly attention to the
concept of solidarity. As we began our research into solidarity's
historical evolution, we were struck by the scarcity of historical and
theoretical writing on the subject. In comparison to the countless
treatises on the evolution and significance of justice, liberty,
equality, and democracy that line library shelves and make up the canon
of Western political thought, there are remarkably few studies of
solidarity. In the words of German philosopher Kurt Bayertz, "Solidarity
as a phenomenon lies like an erratic block in the midst of the moral
landscape of our Modern Age. It is familiar in an everyday sense, and
yet it has remained a foreign body...Until now, the geologists familiar
with this landscape---Modern Age moral philosophers---have taken it for
granted, have circumnavigated it."\[11\] We hope this book begins to
make the concept clearer and more approachable, so that solidarity does
not just appear fitfully in moments of struggle but can be cultivated
consciously and used strategically. It is, we believe, our most
important tool.

While there are many insightful histories and accounts of specific
campaigns and movements, as well as helpful guides to the art of
organizing, few attempt a more holistic assessment or sustained
reflection on the concept of solidarity itself. We suspect this lack
stems, at least in part, from the fact that solidarity is both a theory
and a practice, or what radical educator Paulo Freire called praxis, the
"reflection and action upon the world in order to transform it."\[12\]
That is, [solidarity is [not only]{.mark}]{.underline} a thought or a
feeling, [[a **theory** or a **principle**]{.underline}]{.mark}---[[it
is]{.mark} also [something you **do**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [and it
must involve **others**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In various ways,
solidarity is related to, but distinct from, both community and
identity. Inasmuch as it is something experienced, it is not a given but
must be generated; made, not found. Unlike the concepts of freedom and
equality, [solidarity does not lend itself to **tidy philosophical
formulations**]{.underline}; unlike democracy, [you cannot reduce it to
a set of **clearly defined procedures**]{.underline}; unlike justice,
solidarity is not objective and universal but is always invested in
specific people and outcomes. [Implying **positive obligations** to
act]{.underline}, [solidarity is]{.underline} untidy, particular,
interested, engaged. These qualities make solidarity a
**[difficult]{.underline}** subject [for people who prefer their
politics **more abstract** and **less messy**]{.underline}, but they are
precisely why we find the concept so interesting and vital.

No wonder, then, that even those who would like to see more solidarity
in the world often know little about the concept's origins or evolution.
Traditionally, the term's most common association is with the labor
movement, which adopted "solidarity" as a battle cry during the
Industrial Revolution. This was mainly due to the perseverance of a
brush-maker named Johann Philipp Becker, whom the historian Sven-Eric
Liedman describes as an "ardent champion of the word solidarity."\[13\]
An associate of Karl Marx, Becker argued that solidarity was less about
morality than materiality; its basis was the common exploitation of
workers around the world, and its practice would enable workers to build
the power required to wrest concessions from the wealthy. Though Becker
prevailed in promoting the word's usage, [[Marx]{.mark} and
his]{.underline} most prominent [followers [never]{.mark} truly [dealt
with]{.mark} the fact that [solidarity]{.mark} is something that [needs
to be **constructed**]{.mark}]{.underline}, assuming that workers would
inevitably come together to mobilize due to their shared economic
circumstances. This belief that economic class made solidarity a given
was evidenced by Friedrich Engels's [insistence that]{.underline} "[the
simple **feeling** of solidarity]{.underline}, based on an insight into
the sameness of the class position, [is sufficient]{.underline} in order
to create amongst all of the laborers of all countries and languages one
large and cohesive proletariat party."\[14\] Confidence in a prophecy
that would not come to pass [consigned the word to the realm of
**rhetoric**]{.underline}---a term for union meetings, propaganda, and
song, rather than a robust principle that could guide practice and help
usher in a truly revolutionary era.

Today, [we are in the midst of a **massive political
realignment**]{.underline} in American politics. Both major parties are
sites of profound internal conflicts and power struggles: Democrats are
torn between a growing progressive flank pushing to redistribute wealth,
tackle climate change, and further racial and gender justice and a
corporate wing clinging to the increasingly unequal and failing status
quo; Republicans are being forced to reconcile their outdated
libertarian conservatism with a rabid, conspiracy-driven,
white-supremacist fascism. Meanwhile, [[the neoliberal]{.mark} economic
[paradigm]{.mark}]{.underline} that both parties have adhered to for
decades, which conscripts the state into a project of protecting
markets, restricting democracy, and sabotaging solidarity, [[appears
**exhausted**]{.underline}]{.mark} after fifty years of dominance, [[but
it is **unclear** what will supersede it]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and
whether]{.mark} what comes [next will be **better** or **worse**]{.mark}
than our current condition]{.underline}.\[15\] We sit at a moment of
significant opportunity and threat. To move forward, we must grapple
with the questions of how to build solidarity and with whom.

Later in his life, Kevin Phillips turned on the Republican Party and
wrote multiple books lamenting the deleterious impact of rising economic
inequality, but he did not examine his own role as a tactician for the
market forces he claimed to abhor, nor did he recognize the need to
repair the solidarity he had worked to fray in order to restrain
them.\[16\] And so that project falls to us. [Successfully [resisting
plutocratic efforts]{.mark} to split people apart]{.underline} in order
to dominate public life [[requires]{.mark} creating [**new coalitions**
that have the power to **influence our laws** and
**institutions**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and developing the **stamina**
to **sustain** these]{.mark} new political forms]{.underline}. [By
[conceiving]{.mark} of [ourselves as **intrinsically bound**]{.mark} in
relationships of mutuality and care]{.underline} that span generations,
[we [can understand our obligation to provide]{.mark} a secure and
dignified life to others [while also recognizing that we are entitled to
such]{.mark} an existence ourselves]{.underline}.

Unlike principles such as justice and liberty, solidarity did not become
a popular political concept until the mid-nineteenth century, shortly
before it became the labor movement's motto.\[17\] But in tracing its
ancestry back further, solidarity's roots extend to ancient Rome, where
the idea represented a kind of financial and legal arrangement. The term
originally comes from the legal notion of "obligatio in solidum," a debt
held in common by multiple debtors, each on the hook for each
other.\[18\] It appears in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century French
texts as a term of juridical and commercial application, until it is
more fully established in Napoleon's Code Civil of 1804, in a section
titled Des Obligations Solidaires.\[19\] Throughout the nineteenth
century, numerous legal scholars examined the relationship between Roman
and French law in this regard, but it was during the Industrial
Revolution that the modern usage of solidarity came into being. Workers,
socialists, and a "solidarist" political movement in France adopted the
concept to guide them through dramatic social upheavals. [Solidarity
became a **rallying cry** for the exploited and a way for more
privileged reformers to think about how to solve the problems created by
unfettered capitalism]{.underline}.

The nineteenth-century thinkers who began seriously contemplating and
writing about the idea of solidarity often used the image of the human
body, which is composed of all kinds of different parts---arms, legs,
eyes, knees, lungs, and spleen---working together to function as a
whole.\[20\] They were responding to the rise of a new economy, the
industrial division of labor, and mass migration from rural farms to
cities, which generated both misery and possibility. As society became
more urbanized and complex, early theorists of solidarity optimistically
hoped that people would recognize their fates as linked and make
mutualism a central value of the emerging social order.
[Solidarity]{.underline}, they surmised, [was what could **keep a world
in flux from breaking apart**]{.underline}. Their arguments played an
important role in creating what is known today as the welfare state,
which aims to ensure that its citizens live with a basic level of
dignity.\[21\]

Thus, in its most basic sense solidarity suggests a kind of stability.
Etymologically solidarity relates to the word solid, from the Latin
solidus, meaning "of a strong, firm, or substantial nature or
quality."\[22\] For Émile Durkheim and later sociologists, it is a
measure of group cohesion.\[23\] Generally speaking, solidarity is that
which binds a group---that visceral feeling of connection and mutuality
that sharing a hometown, alma mater, or favorite sports team can
produce.

Importantly, though, this means that [solidarity is not always a
**positive force** or a driver of progress and change]{.underline}:
these bonds can be neutral, reactionary, or transformative, depending on
the community and context. As French legal theorist Alain Supiot
explains, "The broader meaning of solidarity in fact refers to that
which solidifies a human group, without making any assumptions as to the
nature and composition of the glue binding the members of this group
together."\[24\] Solidarity creates passionate in-group bonds, and these
can justify violent othering, as evidenced by the exclusionary
solidarity of white supremacists, ruling elites, and jingoistic
nationalists. [In its **reactionary** form]{.underline}, [it is the easy
draw of **like-to-like**]{.underline}, and [often aggressive in its
rejection of that which is different]{.underline}. [This is]{.underline}
what Kevin Phillips called "**[counter-solidarity]{.underline}**," and
what he sought to foster in order to build a Republican majority to
obstruct the social movements of the 1960s and 1970s. And it is what
continues to fuel the right- wing forces that surge around the world
today.

[In contrast]{.underline}, [we are interested in]{.underline} what we
call "**[[transformative solidarity]{.underline}]{.mark}**"---[the kind
that propelled]{.underline} the fight for civil rights along with other
[movements that have sought to expand the circle of inclusion while also
**altering society's very character**]{.underline}. Unless we indicate
otherwise, [this is]{.underline} what we mean when we use the word
solidarity: [the force that [achieved **universal
suffrage**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [won [the **eight-hour
workday**]{.mark} as well as the weekend]{.underline}, [made
[the]{.mark} modern **[welfare state]{.mark}** viable]{.underline},
[[defeated **Jim Crow**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[enshrined **disability
rights**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and much more]{.underline}. [Solidarity
has stretched across the globe [linking
**abolitionists**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the nineteenth century,
[**national [independence]{.mark}** [movements]{.mark}]{.underline} in
the twentieth, [[and]{.mark} activists agitating for the [cancellation
of]{.mark} **sovereign [debt]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the twenty-first;
[[it]{.mark} is the tie that [binds **women**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
**[queer]{.underline}**, [and **trans people**]{.underline}, [as well as
**workers** and **debtors**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [fighting for equality
and freedom today]{.underline}. [Transformative solidarity is both a
**means** and an **end**]{.underline}, [the **process** of struggling
together and a way of **describing** a kind of society that is more just
and mutualistic]{.underline}.\[25\]

[[Where]{.underline}]{.mark} reactionary or [[**counter-solidarity**
emphasizes]{.mark} **given [identities]{.mark}**]{.underline} (usually
racial, religious, class-based, or national identities) [[and aims to
benefit a **small group**]{.underline}]{.mark} by excluding those who
are different, [[transformative solidarity aspires to]{.mark} create
systems that [benefit **everyone**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Transformative
solidarity points us toward the fundamental fellowship of humankind,
connecting us with others despite apparent differences. In this sense,
[transformative solidarity **bonds** but also **bridges**]{.underline}.
Both reactionary and transformative solidarity have indelibly shaped the
world we live in today. But it is the constructive power of
transformative solidarity, and its role [as a **bulwark** against
reactionary strategies of divide and conquer]{.underline}, that
primarily concerns us here.

Our conception of [transformative solidarity also diverges from the
[many **semblances**]{.mark} of solidarity that]{.underline} are
commonplace today yet, in our estimation, [**[fall short]{.mark}** of
the real thing]{.underline}. [[Appeals to
benevolence]{.underline}]{.mark}, [altruism]{.underline},
[[deference]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[or allyship]{.underline}]{.mark} are
widespread, and invite us to be empathetic and kind; but they all
[[place the onus on **individual action** rather than]{.mark} larger
**[collective engagement]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} on
[harness]{.mark}ing [**pity** or **guilt**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
[rather than]{.underline}]{.mark} [a sense of **[shared
responsibility]{.mark}** or **shared fate**]{.underline}. \[26\]
Similarly, under the virtuous-sounding guises of charity and
philanthropy, the rich and powerful can bestow kindness from on high,
without feeling implicated in the systems that produce poverty,
oppression, and environmental degradation in the first place---the very
systems that also produce their own wealth and power. [Corporations have
learned to play this game expertly]{.underline}, as was the case in
2020, when McDonald's ran an online advertisement claiming to stand with
"victims of systemic oppression" while paying poverty wages, and JP
Morgan, Bank of America, and other companies pledged tens of billions of
dollars to racial equity ---only to allocate the funds as loans and
investments that allowed them to continue to generate profits along with
good press.\[27\] Whether well-intentioned or cynical, [[these]{.mark}
semblances of solidarity [are]{.mark} **woefully [inadequate]{.mark}**
[to the task of]{.mark} transformative [collective
action]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [and sometimes
**antithetical**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to it]{.underline}. [Overcoming
looming threats]{.underline}, [from structural racism to climate
change]{.underline}, [will take more than **self-congratulatory
posturing**]{.underline}. [A just and thriving society requires that its
members **make sacrifices** for one another]{.underline}.

[In contrast to the hierarchical tendencies of allyship]{.underline},
altruism, charity, and philanthropy, [transformative solidarity is
grounded in **equality** and **reciprocity**]{.underline}. Where
[semblances of solidarity too often **give cover** to unjust systems and
the powerful who benefit]{.underline} from them, [transformative
solidarity aims to **upend** oppressive structures]{.underline}. It does
so [by]{.underline} emphasizing commonalities while simultaneously
prioritizing the voice and agency of those who are too often silenced
and sidelined. Solidarity, in this transformative register, involves
[taking strategic risks **together**]{.underline}, [not offering
prescriptions from on high or speaking on behalf of others]{.underline}.
W. E. B. Du Bois captured it precisely when he wrote that "a
consciousness of the humanity of all men, of the sacred unity in all the
diversity, is not merely to lay down a pious postulate, but it is the
active and animate heart- to-heart knowledge of your neighbors, high and
low, black and white, employer and employed..."\[28\]

[Transformative solidarity [involves **expanding** one's sense of
self-interest]{.mark}]{.underline}; [[it creates new communities across
social distinctions]{.underline}]{.mark}, [class divides]{.underline},
[and militarized borders]{.underline}. [It names the actions of
exploited and marginalized groups as they come together to build
power]{.underline}, [but it also involves people who are not themselves
the direct targets of oppression]{.underline}, [who choose to join the
struggle for justice nevertheless]{.underline}. [Examples]{.underline}
of this latter group **[abound]{.underline}**. [[Think
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[white
abolitionists]{.underline}]{.mark}** who risked their lives and
reputations to oppose slavery, [including the insurgent **John Brown**
and the sisters]{.underline} Sarah and Angelina
**[Grimké]{.underline}**, who rebelled against their plantation-owning
father, [[or]{.underline}]{.mark} Friedrich
**[[Engels]{.underline}]{.mark}**, scion of an industrial family, using
his wealth to fund Marx's activities and support working-class
agitation. [Since the dawn of the **AIDS** epidemic]{.underline},
[[citizens]{.mark} of rich countries have been [organizing
against]{.mark} the **[pharma]{.mark}ceutical industry** to ensure
residents of poor countries can access lifesaving
medicines]{.underline}, [while U.S. **[health-care providers]{.mark}**
are now busy [**defying abortion bans** and **anti-trans laws**]{.mark}
to provide for those in need of their services]{.underline}. Or
[consider the networks of [activists who assist
**migrants**]{.mark}]{.underline} making the hazardous trek across the
American desert or the Mediterranean Sea, [[or]{.mark} who offer
[support]{.mark} to individuals who are or were
**[incarcerated]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[It is not **altruism** or **compassion** that inspires people to
act]{.underline} in these cases, [but the recognition that one's own
liberation is **intimately bound** with the liberation of
others]{.underline}. As Eugene Debs famously put it in 1918, "While
there is a lower class, I am in it, and while there is a criminal
element, I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not
free."\[29\] Writing a century later, Derecka Purnell, a young lawyer
and author who was part of the Ferguson, Missouri, uprising, echoed his
sentiment, calling on white people to join the movement against police
brutality as full participants acting in solidarity: "I wanted them to
know that racial violence was bad for them, too. An ally sympathizes. I
wanted less sympathy, and more commitment, risk, and sacrifice to
eradicate white supremacy."\[30\]

[Over the last decade]{.underline}, [social [movements erupted **around
the world**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [forging
solidarity]{.underline}]{.mark} [across lines of race]{.underline},
[gender]{.underline}, [sexuality]{.underline}, [class]{.underline},
faith, [[and]{.mark} nationality]{.underline}. In 2011, Occupy Wall

Settler Colonialism and Racial Capitalism

[The forging of a new academic field of settler colonial studies risks
potentially creating unnecessary binaries between studies of colonialism
and settler-colonialism. It is clear that techniques of colonial
dispossession traveled throughout networks of trade and leisure
established during and throughout the British Empire. Such tools include
the surveillance and criminalization of colonized populations, land
appropriation, resource extraction, the perversion or indeed, attempted
erasure, of native legal systems, and control over the mobility and
political citizenship of colonized populations.]{.underline} English
colonial administrators and freelance entrepreneurs traveled, during the
nineteenth century, between the Indian subcontinent, Australia, Canada,
New Zealand, the Caribbean, the United States, the African continent,
and of course the United Kingdom. They imported and exported the legal
and political infrastructures required for colonial modes of
expropriation. With the advent of the Mandate system, Palestine became
another scene of exchange and implementation of European colonial modes
of governance tested elsewhere. While many scholars have revealed the
formative influence of European models of nationalism and colonial
ideology on early Zionist movements ([Raz-Krakotzkin
2007](https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&type=summary&url=/journals/jewish_quarterly_review/v097/97.4raz-krakotzkin.html\); [Lloyd
2012](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/2201473X.2012.10648826/)),
the detailed work of excavating the way in which the political and legal
techniques of dispossession travelled between different colonial sites
remains underexplored. (Although see [Lowe,

for  exemplary exceptions to this claim). 

[Another binary inherent to the settler colonial analytic is that
between the colonizer and colonized. While adopting a settler colonial
framework is critical to analyzing Israel's modus operandi as a colonial
power, there is a need to contextualize Israel's settler colonial
project within the particular class and racial differences inside Israel
and amongst Palestinians. Ella Shohat's]{.underline}[ critical
work](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118475683.ch16/summary/)[ on
the racial hierarchy within Israel's settler society is a strong example
that highlights the historical marginalization of the Mizrahim, Jews of
Arab origin. Racialized immigrants occupy both the position of settler
in relation to Indigenous communities and the subaltern in relation to
the dominant place of the white European settler. Some scholars in North
America, and particularly
in ]{.underline}[Hawai'i](http://www.amazon.com/Asian-Settler-Colonialism-Governance-Everyday/dp/0824830156/)[ have
grasped how the racialization of particular immigrant communities in
settler states complicates the settler colonial framework. ]{.underline}

[On the other hand, a settler colonial framework must also contend with
the emerging class differences in Palestinian society exacerbated by the
impact of the Oslo Accords.  This is especially relevant when contending
with the question of how Palestinians can challenge the logic of the
Oslo process while the Palestinian Authority, adhering to a fundamental
neoliberal agenda (]{.underline}[Hanieh
2013](http://www.haymarketbooks.org/pb/Lineages-of-Revolt/)[), remains
intact. The Palestinian Authority continues to formulate Palestinian
liberation in terms of truncated statehood on small sections of
Palestinian land and celebrates symbolic acts such as raising the
Palestinian flag at the United Nations while prospects of Palestinian
sovereignty over land continue to diminish daily. Sadly, the PA's focus
continues to be building a neoliberal state apparatus as a way to
"convince" Israel and international donors that Palestinians are able to
run their affairs. ]{.underline} For all intents and purposes, Israel
has succeeded in outsourcing its military occupation to a segment of
Palestinians - this is evident in the relatively large budgets of the
security forces of the PA and the continued security coordination with
Israel. In our view, such differences within both the settler society
and the colonized need to be brought out and fully incorporated into the
settler colonial analytical framework. \
[Racially inscribed dispossession and the capitalist modes of
accumulation that subtend expropriative practices have developed in
spatially and temporally differentiated ways in the colonies, as
elaborated by scores of post-colonial theorists. In other words,
capitalist development in the colonies has not mirrored the transition
from feudal economies to capitalist ones in Europe. The terms
"postcolonial capitalism" and "racial capitalism" both denote ways of
understanding capitalist forms of dispossession that profit from, and
reinforce class hierarchies, patriarchal formations, and racist
ideologies lodged in colonial imaginaries that persist into the present.
 These terms do not neatly fit into a settler-colonial framework and yet
are critical to understanding the political-economic, juridical and
social complexities across various sites of inquiry. Forcing them into a
single analytical category risks losing this richness and undermining
forms of political solidarity across colonized spaces.]{.underline}

Darwish's masterful poem, ["The Red Indian's Penultimate Speech to the
White
Man"](http://harvardreview.fas.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/private/36_Darwish_Joudah.pdf/) begins
with an epigram from the Duwamish Chief Seattle.  [The dispossession of
native land that Columbus' ill-fated voyage inaugurated, binds together
the fates of Native Americans and Palestinians, who resist colonial
dominance over land, time, history, memory, and place]{.underline}. As
Chief Seattle asserts, "there is no Death here, there is only the change
of worlds." We in turn are looking for our own counter-narration, a
language to explain the ongoing violence of dispossession in multiple
contexts. We are reminded of the words of [Mike Krebs and Dana
Olwan](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/2201473X.2012.10648846/):

[We want to build solidarity without reproducing and enacting the same
colonial logics and asymmetric relationships of power on which settler
colonialisms hinge. We believe that our futures are connected and that
we are especially powerful when we enact solidarity by words and
actions. To expect solidarity, we must be willing to give it, share it,
and maintain it. To do otherwise is to risk producing solidarity on the
very colonial terms that our movements seek to challenge and
undo.]{.underline}

Land, Capitalism, and Dispossession

Much of the literature on the political economy of land traces its
genealogy to Karl Marx's analysis of capitalism and the "secret of
primitive accumulation" (1993: 873). The "original sin" of capitalism,
what Marx calls "[primitive accumulation]{.underline}" and [what we
refer to here after as "primary accumulation]{.underline}," is the
process through which the worker is divorced of their means of
production and is thus alienated from their own labor.2 This [is
achieved through the transformation of subsistence production into
capital and producers into wage laborers]{.underline} (874). Before
capitalist accumulation can begin, [this primary mode of
dispossession---the separation of workers from their means of
subsistence---must take place]{.underline}. [Marx suggests that this is
a "historical process" relegated to the "pre-history of
capital"]{.underline} (875). This processual understanding of primary
accumulation is valuable but needs modification for application to
settler colonial contexts. In these contexts, **[the [dispossession of
land is at the heart of domination]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Marx
acknowledges]{.mark} the [varied means used to separate workers
from]{.mark} the [means of production]{.mark}, [highlighting how]{.mark}
"the [law itself]{.mark} . . . [becomes]{.mark} the [instrument by which
people's land is stolen]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (885[). These juridical
forms, not relegated to the past, [are still central to the control of
land in settler state]{.mark} contexts [today]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The story of primary [accumulation entails]{.mark} [not only land being
taken away but]{.mark} also its [commodification]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Polanyi 1944). Indeed, **[the [juridical structures of
dispossession]{.mark}]{.underline}** (land's commodification and
transformation into property) **[[are fundamental to settler colonial
dispossession]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Recent scholarship on [global
land grabbing links]{.mark} large-scale transformations of land
[to]{.mark} transnational processes involving [private capital]{.mark}
and state-managed land tenure regimes]{.underline} (Deininger 2011; Hall
2013; Peluso and Lund 2011). The dispossession of land is frequently
obscured by the absence of a set of clear actors, instead operating
through diff use structural processes. Often, the focus is on sites
outside the Anglophone settler world and involves processes affecting
smallholders (Fairhead et al. 2012; Hall et al. 2011; Li 2011). The
[political valence of these "land grabs" is less suited to describing
settler colonial contexts that operate differently than to large-scale
land investment by multinational private actors and
nation-states]{.underline}.3 Therefore, [[using]{.mark} the]{.underline}
[[land grab as an]{.mark} [analytic necessitates paying attention
to]{.mark} the [ontological basis of state and private-led dispossession
as much]{.mark} the [political-economic mechanisms of
accumulation]{.mark} itself. For Indigenous peoples, as well as peasants
and other agriculturalists, the [loss of land is experienced as more
than just alienation from a means of subsistence production]{.mark}.
[Enclosure]{.mark} of common lands [and]{.mark} their [transformation
into private property]{.mark} [is a double negation]{.mark}: the [loss
of land, and]{.mark} the [devastation of]{.mark} the sets of
[relationships]{.mark} [that constitute land in Indigenous
ontologies]{.mark}. **[Capitalism is fundamental to the structural
conditions of settler colonialism]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

Settler Colonialism and Capitalism

Recent scholarship in Indigenous studies off ers insight into the
imbrication of these forms. Glen Coulthard (2014) uses Marx's notion of
"primary accumulation" to analyze settler colonialism, but he suggests
three important modifi cations: a temporal reframing that sees primary
accumulation as ongoing rather than something relegated to a "stage"
before capitalist accumulation (Harvey 2003; Sanyal 2014); a release
from the developmentalism and economic reductionism of orthodox Marxism;
and a shift of framing from capitalist to colonial relations. Th is last
move enables Coulthard to critique the liberal settler state's emphasis
on recognition as the basis for negotiation over land claims and
self-governance. Coulthard shows that primary accumulation accomplished
through violence is largely replaced in contemporary times with
discursive regimes and other ostensibly benign structures, which are in
reality imbued with relations of power and domination that further
entrench settler colonialism and the extraction of capital from
Indigenous lands.

[[Claims to land]{.mark} are often [established through]{.mark} the
doctrine of [terra nullius]{.mark}]{.underline}, or empty land, a
concept that is still deployed in extant struggles for environmental
justice (Kosek 2006; Moreton-Robinson 2004; Voyles 2015; Whyte 2013).
**[[Labor is largely ancillary to this endeavor, in which land is remade
into property amenable to extracting economic
value]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Coulthard 2014; Wolfe 2009). [Law plays an
important role in these transformations]{.underline}, reinforcing a
racialized and gendered white settler sovereignty over property that
enables Indigenous dispossession, as Aileen Moreton-Robinson (2015)
explicates in her examination of settler claims in Australia and other
Anglophone settler states. Under these regimes, **[[human relationships
to land are restricted to the relationship between owner and
property]{.underline}]{.mark}**.4 Coulthard argues that political
recognition of Indigenous peoples in Canada obscures the ongoing settler
colonial project of primary accumulation---the drive toward
dispossession of Indigenous lands while extracting further surplus value
through resource exploitation---and that any attempt to transcend these
structures of domination requires the resuscitation of relationships of
mutual obligation between land and people as opposed to deeper
engagement with settler-state institutions. Carroll, writing about the
Cherokee Nation, also remarks that Indigenous environmental governance
represents a diff erent, "relationships-based approach" that allows for
"agency of nonhuman beings and the maintenance of relationships with
them" (2015: 8).

[[Without]{.mark} such a [massive transformation in]{.mark} the
[political economy]{.mark} of contemporary settler-colonialism, [any
efforts to rebuild]{.mark} our nations [will remain parasitic on
capitalism]{.mark}, and [thus on the perpetual exploitation of our lands
and labor.]{.mark} [Consider,]{.mark} for example, an [approach to
resurgence that would see Indigenous people begin to reconnect with
their lands and land-based practices on either an individual or
small-scale collective basis.]{.mark}]{.underline} This could take the
form of \"walking the land\" in an effort to refamiliarize ourselves
with the landscapes and places that give our histories, languages, and
cultures shape and content; to revitalizing and engaging in land-based
harvesting practices like hunting, fishing, and gathering and/or
cultural production activities like hide-tanning and carving, all of
which also serve to assert our sovereign presence on our territories in
ways that can be profoundly educational and empowering; to the
reoccupation of sacred places for the purposes of relearning and
practicing our ceremonial activities. [A [similar problem informs
self-determination efforts that seek to ameliorate our poverty and
economic dependency through resource revenue sharin]{.mark}g, more
[comprehensive impact benefit]{.mark} [agreements]{.mark}, and
[affirmative action employment strategies]{.mark} negotiated through the
state and with industries currently tearing up Indigenous territories.
[Even though the capital generated by such an approach could, in theory,
be spent subsidizing the revitalization of certain cultural traditions
and practices, in the end they would still remain dependent on a
predatory economy that is entirely at odds with the deep reciprocity
that forms the cultural core of many Indigenous peoples\' relationship
with the land]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} What forms might an
Indigenous political-economic alternative to the intensification of
capitalism on and within our territories take? For some communities,
reinvigorating a mix of subsistence-based activities with more
contemporary economic ventures is one alternative. In the 1970s the Dene
Nation sought to curtail the negative environmental and cultural impacts
of capitalist extractivism by proposing to establish an economy that
would apply traditional concepts of Dene governance\--decentralized,
regional political structures based on participatory, consensus
decision-making\--to the realm of the economy. At the time, this would
have seen a revitalization of a bush mode of production, with emphasis
placed on the harvesting and manufacturing of local renewable resources
through traditional activities like hunting, fishing, and trapping,
potentially combined with and partially subsidized by other economic
activities on lands communally held and managed by the Dene Nation.
Economic models discussed during the time thus included the democratic
organization of production and distribution through Indigenous
cooperatives and possibly worker-managed enterprises. Revisiting
Indigenous political-economic alternatives such as these could pose a
real threat to the accumulation of capital in Indigenous lands in three
ways. First, through mentorship and education these economies reconnect
Indigenous people to land-based practices and forms of knowledge that
emphasize radical sustainability. This form of grounded normativity is
antithetical to capitalist accumulation. Second, these economic
practices offer a means of subsistence that over time can help break our
dependence on the capitalist market by cultivating self-sufficiency
through the localized and sustainable production of core foods and life
materials that we distribute and consume within our own communities on a
regular basis. Third, through the application of Indigenous governance
principles to nontraditional economic activities we open up a way of
engaging in contemporary economic ventures in an Indigenous way that is
better suited to foster sustainable economic decision-making, an
equitable distribution of resources within and between Indigenous
communities, Native women\'s political and economic emancipation, and
empowerment for Indigenous citizens and workers who may or must pursue
livelihoods in sectors of the economy outside the bush. Why not
critically apply the most egalitarian and participatory features of our
traditional governance practices to all of our economic activities,
regardless of whether they are undertaken in land-based or urban
contexts?[[The capacity]{.mark} of resurgent Indigenous economies [to
challenge]{.mark} the hegemony of [settler-colonial capitalism]{.mark}
in the long term [can only happen if certain conditions]{.mark} [are
met]{.mark}, however. First, all of the [colonial, racist, and
patriarchal legal and political obstacles that have been used to block
our access to land need to be confronted and
removed]{.mark}]{.underline}. Of course, capitalism continues to play a
core role in dispossessing us of our lands and self-determining
authority, but it only does so with the aid of other forms of
exploitation and domination configured along racial, gender, and state
lines. Dismantling all of the oppressive structures will not be easy. It
will require that we continue to assert our presence on all of our
territories, coupled with an escalation of confrontations with the
forces of colonization through the forms of direct action that are
currently being undertaken by communities like Elsipogtog. Second, we
also have to acknowledge that the significant political leverage
required to simultaneously block the economic exploitation of our people
and homelands while constructing alternatives to capitalism will not be
generated through our direct actions and resurgent economies alone.
Settler colonization has rendered our populations too small to affect
this magnitude of change. This reality demands that we continue to
remain open to, if not actively seek out and establish, [[relations of
solidarity and networks of trade and mutual aid]{.mark} [with national
and transnational communities]{.mark} and organizations that are also
struggling against the imposed effects of globalized capital, including
other Indigenous nations and national confederacies;]{.underline} urban
Indigenous people and organizations; the labor, women\'s, GLBTQ2S (gay,
lesbian, trans, queer, and two-spirit), and environmental movements;
and, of course, those racial and ethnic communities that find themselves
subject to their own distinct forms of economic, social, and cultural
marginalization. [[The]{.mark} initially [rapid]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
relatively [widespread]{.mark} [support]{.mark} [expressed]{.mark} both
nationally and internationally [for]{.mark} the [Idle No More]{.mark}
movement in spring 2013, [and]{.mark} the solidarity generated around
the [Elsipogtog antifracking resistance]{.mark}]{.underline} in the fall
and winter of 2013, gives me hope that establishing such relations are
indeed possible. It is time for our communities to seize the unique
political opportunities of the day. In the delicate balancing act of
having to ensure that his social conservative contempt for First Nations
does not overwhelm his neoconservative love of the market, Prime
Minister Harper has erred by letting the racism and sexism of the former
outstrip his belligerent commitment to the latter. This is a novice
mistake that Liberals like Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin learned how to
manage decades ago. As a result, the federal government has invigorated
a struggle for Indigenous self-determination that must challenge the
relationship between settler colonization and free-market fundamentalism
in ways that refuse to be coopted by scraps of recognition,
opportunistic apologies, and the cheap gift of political and economic
inclusion[[. For Indigenous nations to live, capitalism must die. And
for capitalism to die, we must actively participate in the construction
of Indigenous alternatives to it.]{.underline}]{.mark}

**[Indigenous Displacement as Precondition for Private Market of
Ownership]{.underline}** DANIEL DENVIR As the settler project developed,
[Britain and Britain's successor North American states forcibly
relocated indigenous people into discrete reserves and
reservations]{.underline}. Why was the **[establishment of Indian
reserves a necessary precondition for the private market of individual
ownership?]{.underline}** BRENNA BHANDAR The [idea of the
reserve]{.underline} doesn't [originate]{.underline} here. There's some
historical evidence to show that the idea of the tiny areas of reserves,
as it developed in British Columbia, is borrowed [from South
Africa]{.underline}. That idea and practice of creating reserves is
**[essential to the creation of a market in private
property]{.underline}**. Many [First Nations didn't relate
to]{.underline} land as [private property]{.underline}, with everything
that system of property ownership entails like the possessive
individual. So **[to create a market in private property on indigenous
territories required the creation of at least two different economies of
land.]{.underline}** The idea and practice of creating reserves is
[essential to the creation of a market in private property. One is a
market in private property, and the other is the reserve economy in the
space of the reserve.]{.underline} Colonial authorities attempted
through pieces of [legislation like the Indian Act]{.underline} (and
other legislation that preceded that) **[to control all of the kinds of
economic activity and cultural practices that are allowed to take place
within the bounds of the reserve.]{.underline}** Infamously the
[fed]{.underline}eral government [controlled the movement of indigenous
peoples on and off the reserve during certain periods of
time]{.underline}, and land [on the reserve]{.underline} was not held as
individual private property. Reserved land was **[held in trust for the
First Nation.]{.underline}** So these two [economies of
property]{.underline} are very much bound together and related to one
another. It **[became the way that the colonial state dealt with
indigenous displacement.]{.underline}** DANIEL DENVIR The law of
[preemption put the theory of improvement into practice]{.underline} for
settlers, allowing them to [appropriate land by mixing their labor with
it.]{.underline} But that law did not apply in the same way to
indigenous people. What does it reveal that it was [the act of
cultivation that secured white settlers control of land and also, in a
sense, made them white, but that indigenous people could not likewise
become white by doing the same?]{.underline} It seems like this is a
[recurring dynamic across]{.underline} multiple settler-colonial
contexts, including both the [Irish and Palestinian cases]{.underline}.
BRENNA BHANDAR It's quite clear that indigenous peoples in British
Columbia and in the rest of the country cultivated their land. I think
after finishing the book, and moving on to look at preemption in more
detail recently, there's a lot of evidence to show that [settlers would
either ignore or destroy crops that had been planted by First Nation
peoples]{.underline}. [The idea that indigenous peoples do not cultivate
their land --- going back to that Lockean fantasy that America existed
as this uncultivated wild --- is a racial trope]{.underline}. It's also
a con, because it's clear when we look at the historical record that
settlers would routinely destroy crops of First Nation peoples. I think
that this ideology of improvement is cast in racial terms precisely to
**[dispossess indigenous peoples of their land and to justify it on the
basis of this idea of cultivation.]{.underline}** Now, I'm not saying
that indigenous communities here cultivated their lands in exactly the
same way as settlers may have. The way settlers may have emulated some
idea of the homestead, for instance, may have been different. However,
what is clear from the historical record is that **[oftentimes what were
recognized by settlers as crops and cultivated land were simply
destroyed. What we see is a kind of creation of that Lockean fantasy of
the wasteland through a great deal of violence. It's making land into
waste so it can therefore be appropriated.]{.underline}** DANIEL DENVIR
You write, "[Being an owner and having the capacity to
appropriate]{.underline} have long been considered
[prereq]{.underline}uisite[s]{.underline} for attaining the status [of
the proper subject of modern law,]{.underline} a fully individuated
citizen-subject." It turns out, in other words, that political
**[liberalism is deeply historically embedded in capitalist and colonial
social relations.]{.underline}** What is the relationship between wage
labor, property, and this particular sort of subjectivity premised on
the notion that it's subjectivity within interiority, and a rational
interiority at that? BRENNA BHANDAR In some ways, there are two
different ways of understanding that relationship. Between [wage labor,
property ownership, and this proper subject who desires to both own
property and has the capacity to alienate one's labor in the
marketplace, let's say, is obviously the critique of that
relationship]{.underline}. That is a core part of Marx's critique of
capitalism. We can understand that relationship as an oppressive
disciplining force, core to the constitution of the modern legal
subject, the modern human subject even. [We can also see it
as]{.underline} a [racial]{.underline} construct. The idea that [the
proper legal subject is one who has the capacity to freely alienate his
or her labor means that vast swathes of humanity --- who were either
enslaved or indentured or simply did not have the capacity to freely
alienate their labor --- fell outside of it. That became a kind of
teleological understanding]{.underline} of development. And when freedom
comes, that [very notion of freedom]{.underline} ([as explored
by]{.underline} Saidiya [Hartman,]{.underline} Denise Ferreira [da
Silva,]{.underline} Fred [Moten,]{.underline} and others) is also [bound
to this racial history of enslavement. We can think about the racial
histories of indentureship as well. I]{.underline} think that in
addition to the idea of freedom that underlies the idea of one's
capacity to freely alienate labor, there's also the figure of the
proprietorial subject. That is also clearly a racial construct. DANIEL
DENVIR You address [the scholarship on aboriginal rights and argue that
it sometimes takes for granted that colonial imported property laws are
racist,]{.underline} and [in doing so treats racism as a sort of
self-explanatory explanation as to "how property law functions as a form
of domination." Certain readings conjure up race and racism as an almost
transcendent force.]{.underline} What do those sorts of explanations
elide about how race is constructed, in a way that's mutually
constitutive of capitalism, colonialism, and property law? BRENNA
BHANDAR This is a really important distinction in various fields of
critical work --- [work that admits that race, racism, and the
dispossession of indigenous lands are a part of colonial
history.]{.underline} If we take that kind of example, it does not
really delve into how racial thinking and how conc[epts of racial
difference are conceptually bound to legal doctrines of property,
ownership, and contract.]{.underline} The kind of work I'm interested in
doing is trying to crack open the legal doctrines, but also [more
broadly the juridical, to understand how conceptions of racial
difference are constitutively bound to the property law doctrines that
emerge in the colonial setting.]{.underline} It's a very different kind
of conceptual work, one which I think is very important, because in the
former kind of work, you just really lose sight of the importance of
race altogether. It doesn't really do much for our understanding of how
[racism operates --- or crucially, it's contemporary manifestations ---
to just sort of admit by the by that this was racist in some
ways.]{.underline}

### Root Cause

**And, capitalism provides backdrop to indigenous genocide -- labor and
land**

**Libretti,** Associate Professor of English and Women's Studies at
Northeastern Illinois University, **2001**

(Tim, *Modern Fiction Studies*, "The Other Proletarians: Native American
Literature and Class Struggle," Spring 2001, Vol 47, No. 1, muse,
checked 8-23-14)//bh

Similarly, [Ortiz\'s [historical materialist
narrative]{.mark}]{.underline} of colonization and conquest repeatedly
[[contrasts the]{.mark} destructiveness and [inefficiency of
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline} and of exploitation generally [[with the
genuine productive efficiency]{.mark} and humanity [of the
precapitalist]{.mark} and precolonial economy of the [Native
Americans]{.mark}]{.underline}. At each stage of the development of
capitalism after the onset of colonization, Ortiz claims, the productive
capacity of [Native Americans]{.underline} and of the nation as a whole
is curtailed rather than enhanced. For example, Ortiz notes that when
the Spaniards came they were impressed by the irrigation systems and
advanced technologies the Indians had developed; they had [integrated
their technology harmoniously and efficiently]{.underline} into the
ecology [in a subsistence economy designed above all to meet basic human
needs as opposed to maximizing profit]{.underline} or accumulating
monetary wealth. Within a capitalist mode of production, technological
development is implemented, Ortiz suggests, in a way antagonistic to
natural processes and thus in a way antagonistic to people and
inefficient in terms of its productivity and use of resources. For
example, when the Spaniards first came, Ortiz writes, The water ran
sparkling clear, abundant, and fast, and the people irrigated their food
plants and drank from it. In the oral tradition of storytelling the
chuna swirls and is vigorous and healthy. But since the time of the
railroads, the logging town, the carrot fields, and the construction of
Bluewater Dam in the 1930\'s, the people have watched the river. Very
anxiously, the people kept going to Ghoomi and Gahnippa springs, and
they thought about the northwest direction toward Ambrosia Lake. There
seemed to be enough water during the working years of the Irishman and
his pumps, but now there was hardly enough for the people who wanted to
and could farm. (342) [[This]{.mark} dual and [causal narrative of the
development of capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline} and of the withering of
abundance and social and natural health also
[[encompasses]{.mark}]{.underline} for Ortiz [[the exploitation of
Native Americans as wage labor and their genocide]{.underline}]{.mark}:
Grants took its name from a lumber mill, and it grew into a settlement
when the railroad was built. Logs and lumber were shipped from there.
Livestock, including cattle and sheep raised \[End Page 178\] by
Aacqumeh, Laguna, and Navajo people, were a local business activity.
Actually, the village of San Rafael south of the present city of Grants
was the original settlement. It was an outpost for mercantile interests
and a military base of operations in the war of extermination against
the Navajo people. Later, Grants became a trade center though not as
large as Gallup seventy miles westward. \[ . . .\] Grants became a
little city of 15,000 or so in the 1970\'s. After the mid-\'50s with the
discovery of uranium in the Ambrosia Lake and Laguna areas, it grew into
a boom town. It was as drab and disorganized and ill-planned as any boom
town ever was. \[. . . \] The clearest and most blatant example was the
Grants city sewage plant which sits right on the banks of the Rio de San
Jose which flows only twelve miles before it reaches the village of
Deetseyameh. (343-44) These passages all accomplish a sharp analysis of
the central, abiding, and intensifying contradiction of capitalism that
Marx identifies, namely the contradiction between the relations and
forces of production. Just as Marx points out that the social and
economic relations of capitalism fetter the forces of
production\--constraining rather than availing our full productive and
creative capacities and putting the requirements of the system, such as
price and profit, before the welfare of the people living in the
system\--Ortiz similarly points out quite starkly how [[capitalism
advances destructively rather than productively, hardly allowing human
creative potential or natural productive capacity to flourish or develop
fully]{.mark}.]{.underline} To the contrary, [[capitalist development
has entailed genocide and]{.mark} natural [destruction, processes that
rapidly diminish]{.mark} rather than develop and nurture [our productive
and creative capacities]{.mark} as a people, a land, and a
culture]{.underline}. Indeed, Ortiz\'s analytic narrative underscores
how the capitalist system and culture of competition (contrary to the
common wisdom and blind mouths of the U.S. dominant culture) is humanly
and economically inefficient and in fact inimical to creativity and
productivity, ensuring our demise rather than cultivating our prospects
for survival\--or at least for the survival of the human.

### Alt Solvency 

#### Here's evidence for both micro [and]{.underline} macro solvency.

**Taylor and Hunt-Hendrix, 24**---co-founder of The Debt Collective;
senior advisor at the American Economic Liberties Project, founder of
Way to Win and Solidaire (Astra and Leah, "Power in Numbers,"
*Solidarity: The Past, Present, and Future of a World-Changing Idea*,
Chapter 3, pp. 104-107, dml)

Real organizing is a kind of alchemy. It's a process that turns
alienation into connection, despair into dedication, and oppression into
strength. [When solidarity generates and channels the]{.underline} three
[core elements of effective
organizing]{.underline}---[identity]{.underline}, [vision]{.underline},
[and strategy]{.underline}---[regular people have a **fighting chance**
of **shifting the balance of power** in a more just and sustainable
direction]{.underline}.

[This solidaristic spirit has been conjured **countless
times**]{.underline}, [transforming participants and society in ways
**great** and **small**]{.underline}. [It was on display
when]{.underline}, [in **1847**]{.underline}, [the]{.underline}
displaced and dispossessed [Choctaw]{.underline} people
[sent]{.underline} what little [money]{.underline} they possessed [to
help the]{.underline} long-colonized [Irish at the height of the potato
famine]{.underline}, [and during the **Great Depression** when the
employed and unemployed found common cause in the fight for economic
assistance]{.underline}. [It manifested in **1979** in]{.underline}
**[Utah's Great Basin]{.underline}** [when cowboys]{.underline},
[Indigenous people]{.underline}, [and environmentalists collaborated to
**successfully derail**]{.underline} government plans to build
[the]{.underline} **[MX]{.underline}**
**[I]{.underline}**nter**[c]{.underline}**ontinental
**[B]{.underline}**allistic **[M]{.underline}**issile System, which
would have been the world's largest nuclear weapons facility (the
contentious coalition's motto during their organizing meetings was
"Leave your guns at the door," which they meant both figuratively and
literally), [and in **1984** when striking British miners found support
from gay and lesbian activists]{.underline}, [who were also under attack
from the Thatcher government]{.underline}.\[43\] [It was visible in
**2014** when Palestinian activists advised]{.underline}
**[B]{.underline}**lack **[L]{.underline}**ives
**[M]{.underline}**atters [protesters in **Ferguson**]{.underline},
Missouri, on how to cope with state violence ("Always make sure to run
against the wind / to keep calm when you're teargassed, the pain will
pass, don't rub your eyes! #Ferguson Solidarity") [and]{.underline}
appeared [again in **2020** when unionized transit workers in **New
York** and **Minneapolis** refused to allow cops to commandeer public
buses to transport people arrested protesting police
brutality]{.underline} to local precincts. [It materialized in **2021**
when farmers across **India** mobilized a 250-million-person general
strike]{.underline} against livelihood-destroying legislation, [and in
**2022** in **Iran** when men joined the massive pro-democracy protests
women started]{.underline} after the death of twenty-two-year-old Mahsa
Amini at the hands of the "morality police."

[**Again** and **again**]{.underline}, [people build solidarity and
leave the world a better place]{.underline}, [and yet we still struggle
to tell these inherently collective stories]{.underline}. [Too often the
tale of **Us** gets whittled down into a tale of an
**I**]{.underline}---a story about a visionary liberator or savior who
changed the world. We learn about and celebrate incredible
people---think Rosa Parks, Nelson Mandela, Harvey Milk, and so on--- but
hear comparatively little about the organizing communities that shaped
and supported them, or the collectivities that they tried to build to
carry social change work forward. Our simplifying, celebrity-obsessed
[culture **mythologizes** and **distorts** the legacies of talented
organizers and historical figures while also amplifying]{.underline} a
handful of contemporary mediagenic [activists]{.underline}---the latter
too often [possessing a knack for]{.underline} social media and
**[self-promotion]{.underline}**, [but **lacking** a commitment to an
**organized base** they are accountable to and work in tandem
with]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} emphasis on lone heroes [is a kind
of **flip side** to our fixation on increasing numbers for their **own
sake**]{.underline}, [or on **bigger** protests rather than **better**
ones]{.underline}. An unhelpful binary emerges as a result: social
movements are imagined to consist of charismatic individuals on the one
side and nameless masses on the other.

But real organizing is something else entirely. In reality, [**every
successful effort to challenge the status quo** has required a
**multitude** of people playing a **wide range** of roles]{.underline}.
[Allowing for this diversity is one way to grow both **numbers** and
**meaningful organization**]{.underline}---[by making space for people
to bring their **whole selves**]{.underline}, [plug in **where** and
**how** they can]{.underline}, [and learn new **skills** and discover
new **capacities**]{.underline}, [while also offering them opportunities
to become more **invested** and **engaged**]{.underline}.

To unleash the power in numbers, [our goal must always be to **bring
more people** into the fold and to **truly empower** them]{.underline},
[which means enabling them to harness their own creativity and
conviction in coordination with others]{.underline}. **[Ella
Baker]{.underline}**, [who helped build many of the most important
organizations of the civil rights movement]{.underline}, [including
the]{.underline} Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, or
**[SNCC]{.underline}** (a group we'll discuss more in the next chapter),
called this approach "group-centered leadership." Considered by many to
be the most gifted organizer of the twentieth century, Baker
[believed]{.underline} leadership should be shared and accountable, and
she practiced this ethos as much as she preached it, influencing many
important activists over the course of her remarkable life, including
Rosa Parks. "You didn't see me on television, you didn't see news
stories about me," Baker said of her unique approach. "The kind of role
that I tried to play was to pick up pieces or put together pieces out of
which I hoped organization might come. My theory is, strong
[people]{.underline} don't need strong leaders." What they
[needed]{.underline}, instead, was [to be]{.underline} "[**bound
together** by a concept that benefited the **larger number** of
individuals and provided an opportunity for them to **grow** into being
responsible for carrying out a program]{.underline}."\[44\] This is as
good an understanding of solidarity as any.

Baker's group-centered approach is strategic for a variety of reasons,
as she rightly recognized. [It is not about **negating** leadership or
expertise]{.underline}, [but about imparting skills and nurturing
people's capacities so they can **lead themselves**]{.underline}.
[Movement participants are **more likely** to be personally transformed
when they are treated as agents and individuals rather than as **cogs**
in a machine or bodies to be **mobilized on
command**]{.underline}---[and this process of
**subjective**]{.underline}, [**personal** transformation **goes hand in
hand** with the larger aim of **structural**]{.underline},
[**political** change that we seek]{.underline}. [Group-centered
organizing **generates the energy** that makes movements authentic and
bold]{.underline}. [It is the **spark** that distinguished the
world-historic SNCC from the many innocuous nonprofit organizations that
**claim** to care about social equity but do **little** to challenge
entrenched power]{.underline}; [it is the democratic life force
**missing** from]{.underline} once-vital trade [unions captured by
corrupt or complacent management]{.underline}.

[The more power is **shared**]{.underline}, [the more
**vibrant**]{.underline}, **[strong]{.underline}**, [and **durable** our
movements will be]{.underline}. [The less dependent on
high-profile]{.underline}, [charismatic messengers]{.underline}---
messengers who can be killed, co-opted, or corrupted---[or]{.underline}
white-collar [advocates who are disconnected from the daily struggles of
ordinary people]{.underline}, [the **more likely** our causes are to
**endure** and to **succeed**]{.underline}. [Broad and consistent
participation also offers a kind of **protection**]{.underline},
[keeping the muscle of solidarity from **atrophying** so we are better
positioned to **protect** and **shore up** hard-won
victories]{.underline}. [Mass organization makes it **less likely** we
will have to **refight** battles that should be behind us]{.underline}.

In 1974, toward the end of her life, Ella Baker gave a short, powerful
speech at a Puerto Rico solidarity rally, where she reminded her
audience of the important work to be done. She spoke about how, when she
was a small child, a boy called her a racial slur and she struck him in
response. "I had to learn that hitting back with my fists...was not
enough. It takes organization. It takes dedication. It takes the
willingness to stand by and do what has to be done, when it has to be
done," Baker declared.\[45\] For her, [building the power of
numbers]{.underline}--- [reaching out to others]{.underline}, including
those [who don't look or think like you]{.underline}---[was the **only
way** for regular people to overcome systemic forms of
oppression]{.underline}.

Time and again, Baker's method has prevailed. [It was organization and
dedication that enabled **Rome's plebeians** to bring the city to a
standstill]{.underline}. [The same goes for the **SNCC youth** who
risked their lives to register voters in the Deep South]{.underline};
[the **New School**]{.underline} part-time [faculty who forced the
administration to increase their wages]{.underline}; [the **disabled
people** who occupied buildings and blocked intersections to win civil
rights]{.underline}; [and the **debtors** who went on strike and forced
the government to grant billions of dollars in relief]{.underline}. Of
course, we still have far to go. But [these examples and many more
remind us that when we come together in an organized
fashion]{.underline}---[forging new self-conceptions]{.underline},
[embracing radical visions]{.underline}, [and acting
strategically]{.underline}---[we can wield the power of numbers to
**disrupt** business as usual]{.underline}, [wrest
**concessions**]{.underline}, [and pave the way for **future
victories**]{.underline}. This is why powerful interests are so
hell-bent on making sure we stay divided. It is to the long and ongoing
effort to sabotage solidarity that we turn next.

### Alt -- Abolition

#### The alternative is to abolish property in all forms -- only we access the root cause of colonialism, the economy of land must end.

DANIEL DENVIR [The entire structure of our economy and politics in the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and many other places is [built
around real estate and property]{.underline} ownership in general. In
particular, just in the United States, lo**[ok at the endlessly
appreciating housing market being the near-sole vehicle for
wealth-building. It substitutes for an actual welfare state for the
limited portion of the population in the United States that can secure
access to homeownership]{.underline}**. In fact, the more homeownership
appreciates, to act as a substitute welfare state for those inside the
system, the worse things get for everyone outside the homeownership
system, and the harder it gets to break into the homeownership system.
[How should this reality inform how we analyze the contours of
capitalist power in the United States today?]{.underline} And perhaps
elsewhere? How do the histories you tell in your book help us form that
analysis of a capitalist order that is so profoundly about real estate?
BRENNA BHANDAR I really liked [the concept of the "real estate
state]{.underline}" that's developed by Samuel Stein. You're absolutely
right in your diagnosis. In terms of [thinking about how these histories
of settler colonialism inform our understanding]{.underline} of the
contemporary real estate state, we can see that [the inauguration of the
economy of private property is all about creating a market in land. We
have in this conversation focused a lot on the ideology of improvement
and the emphasis on agriculture historically, which also then takes on a
kind of metaphysical quality in the context of Israel-Palestine, rather
than an economic reality.]{.underline} But I think what we see with the
real estate state is obviously a [massive shift to a different concept
of value: that aspect of ownership that is the capacity for owners to
speculate]{.underline}, which is actually a very old story, but maybe
that takes on a different life juridically and in terms of what is
valuable about ownership. The fact that you mentioned, which is so
depressing, but also very true, is the idea that [with the deterioration
of any kind of social welfare state, the objective of becoming an owner
or homeowner or a rentier becomes the path to security]{.underline}. One
way of challenging that is also not a new story. We see it happening
really vibrantly in all kinds of urban spaces: the fight against
corporate landlords, the fight for rent control, the idea of making
ownership less lucrative or less valuable. When I think about it,
conceptually but also practically, I think th**[e answer lies in making
private ownership valueless. That's an abolitionist
objective,]{.underline}** in a sense. I think about Andreas Malm's
phrase "[property will cost us the earth." In thinking about
survivability, and thinking about livability and thinking about things
like the climate crisis, trying to make ownership less lucrative and
valuable really ought to be at the core of our political thinking and
struggle.]{.underline} A massive example of this is through the
pandemic, and [the struggle over the proprietary ownership of the
patents for]{.underline} the [COVID]{.underline} vaccine. If that's any
sign of where we're headed, then the future looks very bleak. Those
[struggling for a loosening of the proprietary powers of the patent
didn't really succeed i]{.underline}n the way that many of us had hoped.
I think the idea of trying to create the conditions where it no longer
pays to be an owner is one way of thinking about this problem.

### Alt = Pre-req

#### The alt is a prerequisite to solve for their impacts. Colonial dispossession and resource extraction is inextricably ROOTED in capital.

Daniel **Denvir**, 7-2-20**23**, \[author of All-American Nativism and

DANIEL DENVIR You write, "[Property law]{.underline} was a
[crucial]{.underline} mechanism **[for the colonial accumulation of
capital]{.underline}**, and by the late nineteenth century, had
[unfolded in conjunction with racial schemas that steadfastly held
colonized subjects within their grip.]{.underline} Property laws and
racial subjectivity developed in relation to one another, an
articulation I capture [with the concept of racial regimes of
ownership]{.underline}." To start off, what are "racial regimes of
ownership"? And how does that concept capture this interplay between
property law and racial orders that are all fundamentally tied together
in the colonial context? BRENNA BHANDAR I use the term "racial regimes
of ownership" to [capture the complex way in which legal
subjectivities]{.underline} --- and we could go beyond that to say
modern concepts of the human --- are fundamentally **[tied to private
property ownership]{.underline}** in the modern era. So "racial regimes
of ownership" is a concept that I develop in the book to explore how
**[rationales for private property ownership emerge in conjunction with
a racial concept of the human. We can't understand modern
conceptualizations of race and racial difference without thinking about
the legal form of property]{.underline}** and vice versa. DANIEL DENVIR
You write, "[If the possession of land]{.underline} was (and [remains)
the ultimate objective of colonial power]{.underline}, then **[property
law is the primary means of realizing this desire]{.underline}**." Why
is it that possession of land was and is so central to colonial power?
What does that reveal about how we should think about land in terms a
broader analysis of capitalism? BRENNA BHANDAR The control and
possession of land is central to colonial endeavors, primarily because
of [the main objective]{.underline} of colonial rule, which is
**[resource extraction]{.underline}**. In order to extract resources, as
much and as efficiently as colonial authorities aimed to do, **[control
over land is basic]{.underline}**. We see this right in the genesis of
different kinds of [colonial enterprises]{.underline}. We can think
about this from the late fifteenth century with [Spanish and Portuguese
colonialism]{.underline}, and then through all of the different forms of
European colonial rule, that [asserting sovereign jurisdiction over
foreign territories is really the beginning point of
colonialism.]{.underline} Now, that right from the start is actually not
necessarily a state function, because we know that many colonial
endeavors begin with chartered companies given monopolies over
particular forms of trade. If we look at [B]{.underline}ritish
[C]{.underline}olumbia, as an example, the [Hudson's Bay]{.underline}
Company was given a **[monopoly charter for a very long time before
colonization became a formal state project]{.underline}** by the British
government. So that, if we look at the charter that the Hudson's Bay
Company was given, it's not just a monopoly charter over trade, but it
is given rights **[by the colonial state to control a vast
territory.]{.underline}** DANIEL DENVIR That was rather obvious at the
time. These days we tend to think of everything as ephemeral or digital.
**[The raw territoriality of capitalist power can sometimes not be as
visible.]{.underline}** BRENNA BHANDAR It depends where you're located.
If we think about [a country like Canada,]{.underline} like much of the
world, [resource extraction is still happening]{.underline}. We only
need to think about the climate crisis and fossil fuel extraction. If we
think about those contemporary forms of resource extraction,
**[maintaining control over indigenous territory remains a key objective
of the state-capital nexus]{.underline}**. So this is both an old story
and still present. DANIEL DENVIR You argue that property law is a
primary means of realizing the colonial desire for the possession of
land. How does [that relate to or depart from prevailing accounts of
settler colonialism]{.underline}? I think most listeners might imagine
settler colonialism as a less legally mediated process, that laws might
make claims on land, but it's more about the active force of settler
violence that makes it a reality. What [are the stakes of thinking about
colonialism as a project advanced by both high politics and the law on
the one hand, and raw violence on the other?]{.underline} BRENNA BHANDAR
That's a great question. I think one of the most useful ways of thinking
about that relationship is to consider how [the imposition of a colonial
legal system required a great deal of violence]{.underline} both at the
hands of individual settlers and gunboat diplomacy, or that kind of
state-driven warfare. In fact, when we look at **[property law, contract
law, and these legal forms that were absolutely central to imposing a
system of private property ownership within settler colonies, they also
required forms of violence that were at face value in violation of
settler law]{.underline}**. The relationship between [legality and
illegality]{.underline} (or what is on the face of it illegal) --- they
are constitutively [bound]{.underline} to one another. I've been looking
at this more recently with an interdisciplinary group of scholars around
the doctrine of preemption. [The doctrine of preemption]{.underline} is
a very good example of this dynamic between property law and individual
settler violence. Preemption is a doctrine that essentially allo[ws
settlers to stake out un-surveyed land that has not been parceled up and
bought or sold by other settlers.]{.underline} Upon registering a
preemption, [settlers would have to fulfill certain requirements such as
cultivating that land or building a house or some kind of structure on
that land]{.underline}, but their focus was really on cultivation.
Settlers from [1859--1860]{.underline} onward in the province of British
Columbia could [preempt up to 160 acres]{.underline} individually. That
eventually [increased to 320 acres]{.underline} per individual. So
**[settlers are literally driving stakes in the ground of un-surveyed
land, doing a sketch of the un-surveyed land, and registering
preemptions. If they could show after two years that they had cultivated
the land, they would then get a certificate of
improvement.]{.underline}** That would be the **[basis
for]{.underline}** obtaining "fee simple ownership," meaning **[private
property rights over that land.]{.underline}** What we see in the
historical record is that **[settlers would often preempt land that was
clearly a part of an indigenous settlement,]{.underline}** lands that
had been cultivated by **[First Nations]{.underline}**, and **[village
sites]{.underline}**. The preemption legislation stated explicitly that
settlers were not supposed to preempt "Indian settlements" or lands that
were clearly in use by indigenous communities. What we see in the
historical record is a lot of settler violence in order to preempt land,
and that violence treated with impunity by the state. It's an example of
how this **[burgeoning colonial state required individual settlers to
preempt land so that the state could solidify its jurisdictional control
over this vast area where the state did not have the "manpower" to
maintain control over this vast territory.]{.underline}** The story
about [law and colonial settlement]{.underline} is one of an [intimate
relationship between individual settler violence and a colonial state
that needed settlers to take over land in order to shore up its own
control. **The state needed individual settlers**]{.underline} to do
that. Individual settlers violated the terms of settler law, used a
great deal of violence against indigenous peoples, and were treated with
impunity by the state. I think the story about **[law and colonial
settlement is actually one of a very intimate relationship between
individual settler violence and a colonial state that actually needed
settlers to rapaciously take over land in order to shore up its own
control over its colonial territory.]{.underline}** DANIEL DENVIR Let's
turn to the beginning of your history, beginning with your refutation of
how that story is conventionally told. How is the history of private
property law typically conveyed as something more narrowly about England
proper? What does that conventional narrative obscure? BRENNA BHANDAR
Sticking with that question of what difference does it make to
understand settler colonialism through a legal lens, I'm not sure
there's a single narrative or origin story of the development of private
property. I suppose within certain more orthodox Marxist traditions, you
look at the enclosure movement in England and colonial Ireland to
understand the emergence of modern forms of private property. The point
that I try to develop in the book is that when it comes to modern
property law, we can't really understand it without looking to the
colonies or settler colonies as a kind of legal laboratory. One thing I
look at in the book is the idea of title by registration within the land
reform movement in England. That's another good example of how land law
reformers in England over a long period of time tried to change property
law to reflect a more commoditized vision of land. They were trying to
reform laws so that land could be treated more as a commodity, be
exchanged and alienated more easily. They attempted to impose a system
of title by registration throughout England. That really failed because
they were dealing with a feudal aristocracy who did not want to make
their lands more easily alienable because of the fear of losing those
lands. Where are these legal doctrines developed? In many ways they are
developed in the colonies, where the colonial state treated indigenous
populations as either less than human or as incapable of owning property
privately. In some instances in Canada, owning property privately was
made contingent on giving up one's status as an indigenous person,
legally speaking. In those contexts, it became much easier for a
colonial government to impose different and more novel forms of
landholding. Even the doctrine of preemption that I just spoke about a
few moments ago is actually not something that's inherited from England.
It's something that has developed in the United States. Robert Nichols,
in his marvelous book Theft Is Property!, maps some of that history of
how preemption comes to be developed in the United States, in order to
deal with the problem of squatting. In the United States, preemption
enabled squatters to retroactively make their illegal occupation of land
legal. The way I described it in the Canadian context is somewhat
different. The state didn't have an excess of squatters squatting land,
but it had a need to attract settlers to settle a vast territory. The
burgeoning colonial state didn't really have the power to do it on its
own. The colonial state treated indigenous populations as either less
than human or as incapable of owning property privately. DANIEL DENVIR
Last year, I talked to Kojo Koram about the colony as a laboratory for
policies that have ricocheted back into the metropole, in the years
after decolonization and amid neoliberalism. Has the colony as a
laboratory for political economy that ricochets back into the metropole
been the case from the very beginning? BRENNA BHANDAR I think so.
There's a few different elements of that. One is that the state was
dealing with a different demographic and different political challenges
than legislators were dealing with back in the UK. In the colonies, the
state was needing to develop and innovate laws and policies at speed.
Governor James Douglas in British Columbia had a very real problem when
it came to figuring out how to financially sustain this burgeoning
colony. The land policies he adopted were really in response to urgent
problems. Much of the innovation, the creation of novel and partially
novel legal doctrines, was circulating through different colonial sites.
With the doctrine of preemption, for instance, Douglas borrowed that
from Oregon, where it had been used quite pervasively. The personnel
were also circulating through these colonial networks: different
colonial administrators, colonial surveyors who may have had experience
in the Caribbean, South Asia, Africa, and then they landed in another
part of the British Empire. They brought with them this knowledge and
these practices. I think that there was a lot more fluidity and
experimentation that was happening in the colonial world. It goes
against the idea that colonialism involves a one-way export of laws and
policies from the UK out to the colonies. I think that is the way
colonialism has been understood for a long time. DANIEL DENVIR You're
saying that [from the perspective of the colonial
administrator]{.underline} there was both an urgent [need and the
political space to innovate, as twisted as it is, with something like
title by registration, which the aristocracy back home were resisting.
It was one of their points of conflict with the rising
bourgeoisie.]{.underline} Ultimately, those **[ascendant economic forces
allowed or propelled these methods developed in the colonies to be
applied in the metropole, regardless of what the aristocracy had to
say]{.underline}** about it. BRENNA BHANDAR That's right. It took much
longer for title by registration to be implemented widely in England. In
England and Wales, it took until around 1925 or just before that land
legislation reform, whereas it was introduced in the colonies in the
1860s. I'm just focused on property law, but if we look at Nasser
[Hussein's]{.underline} work, for instance, the wonderful
[book]{.underline} he wrote [The Jurisprudence of Emergency: Colonialism
and the Rule of Law,]{.underline} that's an examination of how **[the
law of emergency takes on certain valences in the colonial setting. It
has a lot of explanatory value for understanding how emergency laws are
put into effect in our contemporary moment to control racialized
populations]{.underline}** in different European states. One could look
at contract law and criminal law. The scope for this kind of analysis is
fairly unlimited.

[The [Socialist Party]{.mark} (SP) of the Eugene Debs era is often
idealized, but left-wingers within it were already coming into conflict
with the SP leadership by 1912.]{.underline} There is some debate over
how much continuity existed between the hard left of 1912 and the early
Communist movement, whether in ideas or in personnel. How do you see it?

Jacob Zumoff

[On a broad level, there was a [lot of continuity]{.mark}, but
[also]{.mark} [fundamental]{.mark} political [discontinuity]{.mark}.
There was an undercurrent of dissent in and around the SP --- I say
"around" because remember, the SP was [not a centralized party.
]{.mark}]{.underline}There wasn't much of a party-owned press, if any,
with individual newspapers such as the [Appeal to
Reason](http://www.haldeman-julius.org/historical-notes/the-appeal-to-reason.html) in
Kansas and Victor Berger's paper in Wisconsin, or magazines such
as [International Socialist
Review](https://archive.org/details/InternationalSocialistReview1900Vol01),
being sympathetic to the SP leadership though not immediately controlled
by it, and often having different political positions.

[[Within]{.mark} the party[, dissent from the left tended to be
more militant about labor struggles]{.mark} (especially true of members
connected to the syndicalist Industrial Workers of the World) and less
focused on electoralism,]{.underline} and there were ties to European
leftism, particularly among various Central and East European language
groups. But the left within the SP initially consisted of several
overlapping loose groupings, rather than anything sharply defined or
cohesive.

Some, but not all, of this milieu fed into the more organized left wing
of 1919. [[The Socialist Party]{.mark} [leadership]{.mark}
[expelled]{.mark} parts of it and other [members]{.mark} just abandoned
the SP to start building an alternative]{.underline}. Louis Fraina,
Ludwig Lore, C.E. Ruthenberg, James Cannon, and Benjamin Gitlow were all
sympathetic to the SP left before 1919 and went on to found the
Communist movement, along with much of the party membership belonging to
the Russian and other Eastern European language groups.

But the differences between the early SP left and what became the
Communist movement were substantial. In 1912, oppositionists were
dissatisfied with the SP's reformism and its electoral emphasis, while
the left wing of 1919 was galvanized by two events of global importance.
One was the First World War, which revolutionary Socialists saw as an
inter-imperialist war fought by the workers for the interests of the
capitalists. But most European socialist parties supported the war aims
of their own rulers --- what Lenin called social chauvinism, socialist
in words but nationalist in deeds.

The war and the collapse of the Second International exposed the
rottenness of the established social-democratic parties. Officially the
SP in the United States did not support the war, but many right-wing
Socialists did, and the party maintained the same social-democratic
tradition, in any case.

[The other important world event, of course, was
[the ]{.mark}]{.underline}[[Bolshevik
Revolution]{.mark}](https://www.marxists.org/archive/reed/1919/10days/10days/ch1.htm)[,
through which the working class took, and kept, state power for the
first time. This really shook the world, as John Reed said, and American
[Socialists]{.mark} were [thrown in all directions]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Some of those politicized by the Bolshevik Revolution had few links, if
any, to the left wing of a decade earlier. At the same time, there were
prominent figures from the SP left, such as Louis Boudin, who opposed
Bolshevism.

Others, like longtime Socialist presidential candidate and spokesman
Eugene Debs or IWW leader Vincent St. John, were sympathetic to the
Bolsheviks but did not join the pro--Bolshevik left wing, despite
efforts by early Communists to recruit them.

The Irish labor leader James "Big Jim" Larkin and IWW leader [William
"Big Bill"
Haywood](http://www.britannica.com/biography/William-D-Haywood) became
Communists, at least for a while, but did not stay in the United
States. And then you had SPers like Ludwig Lore who were active in the
CP for a while, but ultimately did not want to be in a Bolshevik party.

In addition, the left wing contained many immigrant workers who
identified with the left movements in their countries of origin. They
considered the SP's language federations almost as local outposts of the
parties back home, not as branches of an American Socialist movement.

Some of them supported the Bolsheviks, and the early Communist movement
had more than a dozen foreign-language groups, each with its own paper
and with tenuous links to the central party. But Lenin was opposed to a
federated party made up of independent language and ethnic groups
essentially doing whatever they wanted.

[One of [the key challenges for the early CP]{.mark} --- and I detail
[the successes and failures]{.mark} in my book --- was to [forge a
Communist]{.mark} movement in the United States [out of all these
disparate traditions and personnel.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Scott McLemee

[Disputes among US communists were as intense as any in the world
movement, and handling them demanded a lot of attention from the
Communist International. [What caused the Americans' chronic internal
conflict?]{.mark}]{.underline}

Jacob Zumoff

[Much of the early factionalism --- up to, say, 1924 --- went with the
inevitably painful process of forging a Communist Party in the United
States out of movements coming from diverse backgrounds.]{.underline}
Some fights were domestic reflections of debates that involved the whole
world movement.

For example, at the [Second Congress of the
Comintern](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/jul/x03.htm) in
1920, Lenin waged his struggle against those Communists, often from
anarchist or syndicalist backgrounds, who responded to the corruption
and opportunism of the Second International by rejecting electoral
tactics of any kind, or refusing to work in reformist-run trade unions
--- or even the idea of a working-class party.

Lenin's famous pamphlet from 1920, "[Left-Wing Communism --- An
Infantile
Disorder](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/lwc/),"
while not directed at Americans specifically, played a very important
role in orienting Communists in the US. The Third Comintern Congress in
1921, with its emphasis on trying to find a way to reach non-Communist
workers, was also quite important.

Even the fight against black oppression, in many ways a specifically
American issue, was integral to the Comintern's broader outlook. The
long struggle against national, ethnic, and religious oppression in
tsarist Russia --- what Lenin had called the "prison house of nations"
--- made the Bolsheviks aware of connections between non-class
oppression and the fight for working-class power. This was central to
the Comintern's broader vision.

Scott McLemee

That's a substantial issue and we'll come back to it. But with some of
the factional warfare, the stakes are a lot less clear. How did
Comintern leaders find the patience to deal with it?

Jacob Zumoff

The endless factionalism is certainly dizzying to follow, and it
frustrated early Communists and no doubt the Comintern leadership. But
this does not mean that issues were never resolved. For example, in the
early period, the different groups did eventually fuse into one party,
under the guidance of the Comintern.

[And the Comintern intervened to get the party to work legally, and to
try to work within the American Federation of Labor (AFL) --- where the
majority of organized workers were, despite the pro-capitalist Samuel
Gompers/William Green bureaucracy.]{.underline}

I want to stress that this intervention was not only a one way street.
Not only did the early Communists see themselves as part of a broader
world movement, but they saw it as their right and duty to fight out
their differences and to try to obtain Comintern support.

This was a political struggle, to try to win their comrades, be they in
Chicago or Moscow, to their positions; it bore little resemblance to the
maneuvers for factional advantage of the later 1920s, after the rise of
Stalin.

Of course, no Comintern intervention solved all of the problems of the
American party at once. But, in the early period, when new factional
disagreement broke out, it was usually in new configurations and over
new questions.

In fact these fights were often actually a positive feature --- it gave
the Communist movement in the US a more dynamic nature, especially when
compared to more inert parties, like the British Communist Party.
Working out these issues was an integral part of what I call the
"Americanization" of Communism in the United States.

Perhaps "exhibit A" in the importance of the Comintern was its
insistence on addressing black oppression. For example, back at the
Second Comintern Congress, Lenin had John Reed give [a
report](https://www.marxists.org/history/usa/parties/cpusa/1920/07/0725-reed-negroquestion.pdf) on
what was then called the "Negro Question." (Reed actually would have
preferred to talk about the trade union issue, but according to Reed's
papers at Harvard, Lenin insisted.)

So far from being ineffective, the Comintern's interventions helped to
resolve factional issues, by providing guidance, insight, and authority
that the American Communists did not have on their own.

Scott McLemee

On that topic, definitely. It's mind-boggling how indulgent the
"inclusive" Socialist Party was towards racism, even of the most
virulent sort.

Jacob Zumoff

[Aside from black Socialists such as ]{.underline}[Hubert
Harrison](http://monthlyreview.org/2001/12/01/radicals-known-and-unknown/)[,
who tended to be marginalized within the party, [very]{.mark}
[few]{.mark} people in the SP [understood]{.mark} the importance of
[fighting racial oppression]{.mark} as a central part of struggling for
socialism in the United States.]{.underline}

[[Some]{.mark} leaders, like Victor Berger, [foresaw]{.mark} a
[socialist America as being segregated]{.mark}. The best of the lot was
probably ]{.underline}[Eugene
Debs](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/08/debs-socialism-race-du-bois-socialist-party-black-liberation/)[,
who was strongly opposed to racism and refused to speak to segregated
audiences.]{.underline}

[The early American Communist Party inherited this sort of colorblind
framework --- at a time when [black radicalism]{.mark} (the so-called
New Negro movement) [was emerging that]{.mark}, among other things,
advocated self-defense against racist attacks. This legacy of
colorblindness is no doubt why the tens of thousands of early Communists
included just one black member, Otto Huiswoud.]{.underline}

Scott McLemee

Among the Communist Party of South Africa's early slogans was "Workers
of the world, unite and fight for a white South Africa!" Was there
anything comparable in the American Party, before the Comintern pushed
it to deal with racial oppression?

Jacob Zumoff

On the surface there were similarities between the early days of the
Communist Party in both countries. Both consisted mainly of white
immigrants who did not see the need to champion black liberation until
prodded by the Comintern. The South African Communists' position in
the [1922 Rand
Strike](http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3408900187/miners-strike-south-africa.html),
when that slogan was used, is the most grotesque example.

But it is important to keep in mind the fundamental differences between
South Africa and the United States. Capitalism in both countries is
based upon black oppression, but in South Africa, black people are the
overwhelming nationally oppressed majority. A tiny white minority is
able to achieve European-style living standards through the
super-exploitation of black workers.

In the United States, black people are a specially oppressed minority, a
race-color caste. Black oppression has roots in slavery and the failure
of [radical Reconstruction after the Civil
War](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/08/second-american-revolution-civil-war-charleston-emancipation-lincoln-union/);
Black people are subjected to forcible segregation, regardless of
wealth. Racial oppression divides workers and serves as a club to batter
the entire working class, white as well as black.

This is why the "Negro Question" was essential to Communism at this
time, especially as black people were becoming economically integrated
into industrial capitalism, albeit at the bottom.

There will be no liberation of black people from racial oppression in
the United States short of a socialist revolution, and there will be no
socialist revolution in this country unless Communists seriously put the
struggle for black equality at the forefront of their political agenda
and program.

Scott McLemee

Despite the best efforts of the Comintern, the American party really
dragged its feet about making antiracism a high priority until at least
1928. It didn't start recruiting African-American members in significant
numbers until the Depression hit. How do you understand American
Communist inertia on this issue, which lasts most of a decade?

Jacob Zumoff

Two developments were underway during the period when the early
Communist movement was being essentially indifferent to the fight for
black freedom. Through [the "Great
Migration"](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/09/06/the-uprooted) significant
numbers of black people moved from the rural South to both the urban
South and the urban North, plus there was significant immigration from
the Caribbean, especially to New York City.

So black people were becoming part of the industrial working class,
albeit forcibly segregated at the bottom. The other phenomenon was
the [New Negro
movement](http://exhibitions.nypl.org/africanaage/essay-renaissance.html),
which I mentioned earlier. Often centered in Northern cities like New
York and Chicago, it was forged out of the belief that black people had
the right to defend themselves against the wave of racist pogroms.

The movement was heterogeneous, but it included a significant number of
sympathizers with the Bolshevik Revolution --- most notably the African
Blood Brotherhood (ABB), made up mainly of Caribbean immigrants living
in Harlem.

While sympathetic to Bolshevism, they were initially aloof from the US
Communist movement. As I detail in my book, the intervention of the
Comintern was crucial to many of the ABB members joining the CP by the
early 1920s.

The ABB cadres formed the nucleus for Communist work among black people
in upper Manhattan, the South Side of Chicago, and elsewhere. The party
was making attempts to recruit black members through the "Negro
Sanhedrin" in 1924 and the American Negro Labor Congress in 1925. Judged
solely by the numbers, these efforts weren't very successful in the
short term, but they did "raise the red flag," as it were, making the
Communists known among black militants.

Scott McLemee

Fair enough. But I recall reading somewhere that as of 1930, the party
had about fifty black members. That's 49 more than it started out with,
but still . . .

Jacob Zumoff

[Well, according the figures I have seen, [there]{.mark} [were]{.mark}
about [300 black Communists]{.mark} in 1930; there were about [1,000 in
1931.]{.mark} The party's membership was still largely first and second
generation immigrants, but it had begun recruiting black people,
including in the South. Of course, the CP's work in the 1920s was not
perfect.]{.underline}

[It was marred by various things, often [reflecting broader problems in
the Communist movement, including factionalism]{.mark} and, later, the
rise of Stalinism. As my book chronicles, there was also a [constant
struggle waged by both these black cadres and the Comintern to have the
party emphasize the fight for black liberation.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Nonetheless, it is unlikely that the party would have been able to
become such a factor among black Americans had it not been for this
work. Just to use one example, this helped the Communists appreciate the
significance of the frame-up of nine black youths in Scottsboro,
Alabama, in 1931.]{.underline}

[Communists throughout the country, and internationally, led a campaign
that not only publicized the injustice against the "Scottsboro Boys" ---
they showed how that frame-up symbolized the entire racist capitalist
court and criminal system.]{.underline}

[[Socialists are]{.mark} often [accused of]{.mark} ignoring or
[downplaying racism]{.mark}, or objectionably "reducing" it to
class]{.underline}. [[But this ignores a rich tradition of]{.mark}
Marxist [theorizing about racial oppression]{.mark} that has come to be
known as "Black Marxism." The tradition]{.underline} of Black Marxist
thought --- which [includes W. E. B. Du Bois, C. L. R. James, and Frantz
Fanon, among others --- emphasizes]{.underline} both [the]{.underline}
historical [centrality of capitalism to racial oppression and the
destructive consequences of racial oppression for black workers and
workers generally.]{.underline} Jacobin contributor Jonah Birch recently
sat down with New York University professor Jeff Goodwin, a scholar of
revolutions and social movements who has written about Du Bois and the
Black Marxist tradition for Catalyst, to talk about the enduring
intellectual contributions of Black Marxist intellectuals to social and
political thought. Their discussion covered the centrality of capitalism
to racial oppression, the heterogeneity of Black Marxist thought, and
the continued life of this theoretical tradition today. Jonah Birch You
recently wrote in praise of Black Marxism in Catalyst. What exactly do
you mean by "Black Marxism"'? Jeff Goodwin The term refers to African,
African American, and Afro-Caribbean writers, organizers, and
[[revolutionaries]{.mark} who have [draw]{.mark}n [upon Marxist theory
to understand]{.mark}]{.underline} --- the better [[to destroy
---]{.mark} [both racial oppression and class exploitation, including
colonialism]{.mark}]{.underline}. So [it]{.underline}
refer[s]{.underline} to [a theoretical and political tendency within
Marxism]{.underline}. It's analogous to Marxist feminism, which of
course draws upon Marxist theory to understand gender oppression. People
sometimes say that Marxism has a "race problem," meaning that Marxists
don't take race seriously. But honestly, I can't think of a theoretical
or political tradition, whether liberalism, black nationalism, or
critical race theory, that offers more insights into racial oppression
than Marxism, and this is largely due to the Black Marxist tradition ---
although you of course find hostility to racial oppression and
colonialism in the work of classical Marxists like Rosa Luxemburg and
Vladimir Lenin, and in the work of Karl Marx himself. And yet [many
people, including people on the Left, are unaware of this tradition of
theory and practice.]{.underline} Jonah Birch What would you say are the
key tenets of Black Marxism? Jeff Goodwin Black Marxism is not
homogeneous, but the central idea is that [[capitalism has]{.mark}
historically [been the main pillar of racial oppression in the modern
era]{.mark}.]{.underline} And by racial oppression, I mean the
political, legal, and social domination or control of African and black
peoples. What does it mean to say that capitalism is the main pillar or
foundation of racial oppression? [Black Marxists point to two
fundamental characteristics of capitalism --- [capitalists' ceaseless
drive for cheap labor]{.mark} and resources, on the one hand, [and
workers' competition for jobs]{.mark}, on the other]{.underline} ---
[[as the root causes of racial oppression]{.underline}]{.mark}. So
notice right away that, [while [racial oppression is produced and
motivated by capitalism]{.mark} according to Black Marxists, it is
obviously not the same thing as class exploitation]{.underline}. Rather,
[it facilitates the exploitation of black labor and, thereby, of all
labor. And [to say that racism in its modern form is a product of
capitalism is not to diminish]{.mark} in any way whatsoever
[racism's]{.mark} horrendous [consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}. Quite
the contrary. Black Marxists emphasize how black peoples in the modern
era have confronted political and social domination as well as the
extreme forms of economic exploitation this domination has enabled. The
political oppression of black peoples is horrible in its own right, and
it also makes possible especially brutal forms of labor exploitation.
