States Secretary of the Interior; U.S. Department of the Interior,

Gas Leasing Program,"

WASHINGTON --- Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum today directed the
[[B]{.mark}ureau of [O]{.mark}cean [E]{.mark}nergy [M]{.mark}anagement
[to initiate]{.mark}]{.underline} the [first step in a robust public
engagement process to develop]{.underline} a new [[schedule for
**offshore oil and gas lease sales**]{.underline}]{.mark} on the U.S.
Outer Continental Shelf.

"Launching the process to develop the [11th National Outer Continental
Shelf Program [marks a **decisive step** toward securing **American
Energy Dominance**]{.mark}]{.underline}," said Secretary of the Interior
Doug Burgum. "Through a transparent and inclusive public engagement
process, we are reinforcing our commitment to responsible offshore
energy development---[driving **job creation**, [bolstering **economic
growth** and strengthening **American energy
independence**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Under President Donald J. Trump's
leadership, we are [unlocking the **full potential** of our offshore
resources to [**benefit** the **American people** for
**generations**]{.mark} **to come**]{.underline}."

BOEM will soon publish in the Federal Register a Request for Information
and Comments on the preparation of the 11th National OCS Oil and Gas
Leasing Program. This publication will initiate a 45-day public comment
period and serve as the initial step in the multi-year planning process.

Notably, BOEM's jurisdiction on the OCS has recently changed. A new
planning area offshore Alaska---the High Arctic---is being established
as the 27th OCS planning area. Additionally, boundaries of other
existing planning areas are being updated to align with BOEM's revised
jurisdiction. Details on these changes will be included in a forthcoming
Federal Register notice and posted to BOEM's website.

As mandated by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, the Department of
the Interior must solicit input from interested and affected parties
during development of the National OCS Program. Consistent with prior
efforts, BOEM will request information on all OCS planning areas at this
initial stage.

Once finalized, the 11th National OCS Program will replace the current
10th Program (2024--2029), which includes just three lease sales over
five years---all located in the Gulf of America. While BOEM continues
work to complete those sales, development of the 11th Program will
proceed concurrently.

The RFI does not propose a specific timeline for future lease sales or
make any early determinations regarding which areas may be included.
Instead, it invites stakeholders to provide insight and recommendations
for leasing opportunities, raise concerns and identify other existing
uses that may be affected by offshore leasing.

The OCS is a vital national resource, playing a critical role in
America's energy security. As of April 1, 2025, BOEM manages 2,227
active oil and gas leases covering approximately 12.1 million acres in
OCS regions. Of these, 469 leases are currently producing oil and gas.

These leases generate billions of dollars in revenue for the U.S.
Treasury and state governments while supporting hundreds of thousands of
American jobs. In fiscal year 2024 alone, production from OCS leases
accounted for approximately 14% of domestic oil production and 2% of
domestic natural gas production, yielding \$7 billion in federal
revenues.

Additionally, the [OCS holds **vast quantities** of undiscovered energy
resources]{.underline}. BOEM's most recent assessment estimates a mean
of [68.79 billion barrels of oil and 229.03 trillion cubic feet of
natural gas]{.underline}.

President Trump's Executive Order 14154, ["Unleashing American Energy,"
[underscores the **national interest**]{.mark} in maximizing the use of
affordable, [reliable **domestic energy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
order establishes [U.S. policy to \"encourage energy exploration and
production on federal lands and waters]{.underline}, including the Outer
Continental Shelf, to meet the needs of our citizens and
[[solidify]{.mark} the **[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates** [as a
**global energy leader**]{.mark} long into the future]{.underline}."

Earlier this year, the Trump administration reaffirmed its commitment to
offshore energy development. On April 4, 2025, Secretary Burgum directed
BOEM to move forward with a lease sale in the Gulf of America.

[**[Energy Dominance]{.mark}** remains a [**cornerstone** of U.S.
**economic strength** and]{.mark} **global
[leadership]{.mark}**]{.underline}. By expanding offshore capabilities,
the [United States is ensuring affordable energy for consumers, creating
high-paying jobs, and **reducing dependence on foreign
adversaries**]{.underline}. Under President Trump's leadership, the
Department of the Interior is cutting red tape, unleashing America's
natural resources, and putting Americans back to work.

news/market data to the energy industry; NGI Staff Reports, "Chevron\'s
Watson Says Limited Resources Stymie BOEM Permitting,"

Chevron\'s Watson Says **[[Limited Resources Stymie BOEM
Permitting]{.underline}]{.mark}**

It\'s **[not]{.underline}**, in fact, [animosity toward the oil and gas
industry but rather **[limited staff and resources]{.mark}** that are
**[hindering]{.mark}** federal [officials\' abilities to
fast-track]{.mark} **deepwater [drilling
projects]{.mark}**]{.underline}, Chevron Corp. CEO John Watson said
Wednesday.

Watson\'s comments in support of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management,
Regulation and Enforcement (BOEM) came during a forum in Washington, DC,
sponsored by The Hill, which covers Capitol Hill; and the American
Petroleum Institute (API). BOEM and Director Michael Bromwich have been
accused by some lawmakers and industry officials of intentionally
delaying offshore drilling because of last year\'s Macondo well blowout
in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM).

\"[I don\'t believe that Director Bromwich and his people are trying to
slow-walk permits]{.underline},\" Watson said. \"I think [they are
trying to do their job very well. **Whether** they have the **resources
to do it is another matter**]{.underline}. Whether there\'s political
overtones elsewhere, that\'s for others to judge.\" [[BOEM is
\"working]{.mark} very [hard]{.mark} to process the permit
applications\" [but]{.mark} it **[lacks the staff to boost]{.mark} the
[approval process]{.mark}**]{.underline}. More regulations were imposed
on the industry following the GOM oil spill.

The [API on Wednesday and others in recent months have voiced concerns
that BOEM\'s revised deepwater permit approval process]{.underline},
among other things, is hampering job creation (see Daily GPI, Sept. 8).
The BOEM instituted stricter regulations following the Macondo blowout,
but last month the agency implemented several tools to help operators
improve the quality of their submitted exploration and development plans
and permit applications to expedite processing (see Daily GPI, Aug. 31).

At the end of August BOEM said it had approved since mid-February 113
deepwater permits for 34 unique wells that require subsea containment.
There were 17 permits pending and 22 permits returned to the operators
with requests for additional information, particularly information
regarding containment. Additionally, BOEM had approved 45 permits for
activities including water injection wells and procedures using surface
blowout preventers. Only one of these permits was pending and one permit
has been returned to the operator for additional information.

\"The bar has been raised,\" said Watson. \"One of the opportunities for
the Obama administration is to make sure the BOEM is fully funded
because\...there is pressure on permitting.\"

Congress awarded BOEM more funding in the 2011 budget deal that was
forwarded to President Obama in April (see Daily GPI, April 18). The
first oil and gas lease sale in the GOM since the Macondo well blowout
is scheduled to be held Dec. 14 in New Orleans (see Daily GPI, Aug. 22).

Analysts with FBR Capital Markets in a note Tuesday appeared to agree
with some of Watson\'s comments.

\"Our conversations suggest that, contrary to many investors\'
expectations, the [Department of Interior is issuing deepwater Gulf of
Mexico permits with relatively few political barriers]{.underline},\"
said analysts. \"This reinforces our view, that rather than being
political, the [[**GOM permitting drag** is]{.mark} more [reflective
of]{.mark}]{.underline} the increased work required to issue each permit
and the **[[limited bureaucratic resources
available]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As a result, [we continue to expect
continued **slow recovery** of the deepwater **permitting
rate**]{.underline}. Moreover, our analysis shows that the moratorium
eliminated the permitting backlog, which is historically three times the
rig count. Thus, the [[**permitting pace** would need to be
**significantly increased**]{.mark} to rebuild the backlog to maintain
the current rig count]{.underline}, much less support 28 rigs.\"

More rigs may leave the GOM because of the slowdown in permit approvals,
said the analysts.

\"Our proprietary analysis of BOEM deepwater drilling permit approvals
and other regulatory filings leave us convinced that the current
deepwater GOM active rig count of 20 is unsustainable at the current
pace of permit approvals. Furthermore, unless the pace of permit
approvals increases, then we would expect between eight and 20
additional rigs to depart the deepwater GOM, in addition to the 12 that
have already left or committed to leave. Eight assumes the pace of
permitting picks up to support the current rig count, while 20 assumes
today\'s pace of permit approvals persists.\"

On Tuesday Chevron announced a new discovery at its Moccasin prospect in
the deepwater GOM five months after it resumed drilling the well (see
Daily GPI, Sept. 7).

Watson said Chevron would continue to \"make big bets in the Gulf of
Mexico\" because \"we are excited about the opportunities in the
Gulf\...We\'re also going to continue to drill exploration wells where
we have opportunities.\" [The \"**[key]{.mark}**\" [to **more
discoveries**]{.mark}]{.underline} like Moccasin, he said, \"[[will be
**rapid permitting**]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"

#### U.S. energy dominance averts [great power war.]{.underline}

**Roth '25** \[Diana Furchtgott-Roth, the former acting assistant
secretary for economic policy at the U.S. Department of the Treasury and
now directs the Center for Energy, Climate, and Environment at The
Heritage Foundation. She is an adjunct professor of economics at George
Washington University and received degrees in Economics from Swarthmore
College and Oxford University, 7-15-2025, \"Why American Energy
Dominance Is a Strategic Imperative\", National Interest,
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/energy-world/why-american-energy-dominance-is-a-strategic-imperative\]//LASA-AR

[**Energy dominance** is]{.underline} too important to be confined to
economics. Instead, it [is a strategic imperative]{.underline}.

The [Trump administration's energy dominance]{.underline} agenda is not
merely an economic policy but a strategic doctrine. Its [objectives are
clear: 1) to ensure **energy independence** through the use of domestic
**fossil fuels** and nuclear power; 2) to influence **global energy
prices**; 3) to provide affordable, reliable energy to Americans and our
allies; and 4) to **reduce dependence** on China's green energy supply
chains. These goals]{.underline} reflect a realist approach to energy
policy, [grounded in **national interest** and **global
leverage.**]{.underline}

This [marks a **sharp departure** from the Biden administration's
climate-centric energy strategy]{.underline}. In the name of
decarbonization, President Biden restricted oil and gas development on
federal lands and imposed sweeping regulations across federal agencies
to discourage fossil fuel production and infrastructure. The result was
higher energy costs for American households and businesses, with
negligible effects on global temperatures either now or projected for
the end of the 21st century.

These costs have not been evenly distributed. Lower-income Americans,
who spend a larger share of their income on energy and food, have borne
the brunt. Small businesses and farmers, heavily reliant on
transportation and electricity, have also suffered. Meanwhile, the
National Electricity Reliability Corporation warned in its December 2024
report of a fragile grid and elevated blackout risks beginning in 2025,
particularly in the central and eastern United States.

The value of [energy dominance was **underscored** during the
**Israeli-Iranian** conflict, when oil prices briefly spiked by \$10 per
barrel before stabilizing at \$65 a barrel]{.underline}. Markets
responded not to the conflict itself, but to expectations of future
supply --- expectations now anchored by North America's role as the
world's leading oil and gas producer.

President Trump is advancing this agenda through legislative, executive,
and regulatory means. The new One Big Beautiful Bill Act terminates tax
credits for electric vehicles and residential clean energy in 2025 and
phases out wind and solar subsidies by 2028. This legislation
strengthens domestic industry and national security by ensuring that the
United States relies on its own energy resources rather than those
controlled by Beijing.

Executive orders have opened new areas to oil and gas development,
prevented premature power plant closures, and revoked California's
authority to set de facto national vehicle emissions standards. States
retain the right to impose their own restrictions, but those choosing to
develop their energy resources will benefit from lower costs and
enhanced competitiveness in energy-intensive manufacturing.

With 273 billion barrels of technically recoverable crude oil and nearly
3,000 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, the United States possesses
resources that enable it to both meet domestic demand and support allies
abroad. President Trump's reversal of the natural gas export ban
positions the United States to dominate global energy markets and
provides a counterweight to authoritarian energy exporters.

[Energy dominance also enhances the United States' **geopolitical
leverage**.]{.underline} In regions plagued by energy poverty, such as
sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and South Asia, [American energy
exports can serve as a **tool of diplomacy** and development. Lower
domestic energy prices will also **incentivize companies** to expand
operations in the **U**nited **S**tates, facilitating our **decoupling**
from China and revitalizing American manufacturing.]{.underline}

The international [implications extend **beyond trade**]{.underline}. By
rejecting the net zero orthodoxy that has gripped Western elites, the
United States is setting a new standard. As American growth accelerates
under a pro-energy regime, other nations will be forced to reconsider
their own policies or risk economic decline. The precedent is clear:
when President Reagan slashed the top marginal tax rate in 1986, other
developed nations followed suit. In 1988 alone, Britain, Canada, Japan,
and New Zealand all enacted significant tax cuts to remain competitive.

Europe's [manufacturing base is **already eroding** under the weight of
net zero mandates]{.underline}. Germany, once an industrial powerhouse,
is shedding jobs as climate regulations and cheap Chinese EV imports
undermine its auto sector. The lesson is stark: environmental policies
that raise costs and empower the Chinese Communist Party are not just
economically unsound but strategically dangerous.

The question now is whether the European Union and the UK can pivot. If
they remain shackled to rigid net zero laws, they risk stagnation,
rising unemployment, and growing disparities in living standards
compared to a resurgent United States.

[Energy dominance]{.underline} is not a slogan---it [is a
**cornerstone** of national power. It underpins **economic resilience**,
strengthens alliances, and **deters adversaries**. In a world where
energy is both a commodity and a weapon, the United States cannot afford
to **cede control** to regimes that do not share its
values.]{.underline}

By embracing a strategy rooted in abundance, sovereignty, and strategic
foresight, [the **U**nited **S**tates is not just powering its
economy---it is securing its future and the future of its
allies.]{.underline}

The [Growing Importance of Energy Independence]{.underline}

Mitigating Geopolitical Risks

[[Dependence on foreign]{.underline} [energy]{.underline}
[exposes]{.underline} [firms]{.underline} [to]{.underline}]{.mark}
global events such as [wars and **[trade
conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Energy independence protects
businesses from these interruptions. [[Energy]{.underline}]{.mark}
in[[dependence]{.underline}]{.mark} goes beyond protecting companies
from the interruptions created by global wars.

It also [[weakens]{.underline}]{.mark} a country's [**[negotiating

[may]{.mark}]{.underline} often [[be used as a political

[better]{.mark}]{.underline} able [[to defend]{.underline}]{.mark} its
**[[sovereignty]{.underline}]{.mark}** and negotiate from a position of
strength.

Lowering costs

Businesses may use renewable energy to stabilize their energy costs and
prevent price increases in the fossil fuel markets. The long-term cost
reductions associated with renewable energy are becoming more obvious.

#### Consolidating energy security is crucial to prevent [global recession.]{.underline} 

**Eberhart '23** \[Dan Eberhart, CEO of Canary, one of the largest
privately-owned oilfield services companies in the United States, served

Many [lessons can **be taken** from Russia's war on
Ukraine,]{.underline} but perhaps the most crucial is that [energy
security -- and the **blessings** of America\'s energy abundance --
**should not** be taken for granted]{.underline}.

And while energy prices have fallen, this is [no time to become
**complacent**.]{.underline} Continued fears about the possible onset of
a global recession and a mild winter help explain the recent retreat in
oil and gas prices, but supply constraints remain a genuine concern.

[Energy supplies are a **global commodity**]{.underline}. The analogy of
a giant bathtub is often used to explain how a [reduction of energy
supply anywhere in the world reduces the amount available on the market
and **increases competition** -- and the price -- for that supply
**everywhere.**]{.underline}

Moscow recently announced a 500,000-barrel-per-day production cut to
take effect next month. Removing those barrels from the market will
increase the price of oil. There are also concerns about the impact of
years of underinvestment by oil and gas companies in the United States
on supply. Goldman Sachs is warning clients of potential commodity
shortages later this year, including in energy where it sees Brent
rising to \$105 a barrel and LNG rising to \$55 per million Btu.

That poses a potentially [massive problem to the **global
economy,**]{.underline} which is still grappling with high inflation and
has not seen demand fully return to pre-pandemic levels[. The importance
of abundant U.S. energy resources has **come to the forefront** over the
past year on the world stage as a calming, balancing force for markets
**rudely jolted** by **geopolitical unrest**.]{.underline}

It's why the previous administration pursued an "[energy dominance"
agenda]{.underline} -- to [ensure Americans were **insulated** from
shocks to the energy market and **help address** global supply crises
when they arise]{.underline}.

The Biden administration continues to treat the domestic oil and gas
industry as the villain in recent events, accusing it of price-gouging,
war profiteering, and, ironically, underinvesting in exploration and
development of new supply despite federal policies that thwart domestic
production at every turn. President Biden remains committed to a "Keep
It in The Ground" strategy despite his rhetoric against high energy
prices.

The approach of Biden and his Democratic coalition on Capitol Hill to
leasing federal lands and waters, permitting new pipelines, general
reform of the federal permitting system, or any initiative that
encourages domestic production continues to frustrate U.S. energy
security goals.

Biden continues to double down on the energy transition, a decision that
may pay off in the long run. In the immediate future, though, America --
and the world -- will continue to depend on oil and gas to run their
economies. Until tanks run on solar power, petroleum will continue to
define energy security -- and energy security is national security.

After the bloody events of the past year, [Americans should **take
heart** in North America's **resource abundance**]{.underline}. Still,
they should be equally concerned about the direction of U.S. energy
policy and the unnecessary risk it poses to the nation.

Because while no one denies that a transition to a lower carbon economy
is underway, it will take decades to accomplish. In the meantime,
[America must maintain its status as an **energy superpower** capable of
rescuing its allies -- or the entire global energy market -- in
**turbulent times.**]{.underline}

Energy independence benefits more than just companies and people; it has
far-reaching ramifications for the whole economy. By lowering dependency
on imported fossil fuels, [[governments]{.underline}]{.mark} may
[[retain]{.underline}]{.mark} more [[money]{.mark} in their own
economies**, [encouraging]{.mark} [businesses]{.mark}**]{.underline}
such as renewable energy production [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
technological [[research]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} transition [[produces]{.underline}]{.mark}
employment and promotes [[innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially in
areas [that invest]{.underline} extensively [[in]{.underline} [solar,
wind, and]{.underline}]{.mark} [[battery]{.underline}]{.mark}
technology. Furthermore, [[energy-independent countries
are]{.underline}]{.mark} better [[positioned]{.underline} [to **escape
economic shocks**]{.underline}]{.mark} from unpredictable global energy
markets, [resulting in]{.underline} improved **[financial
stability]{.underline}** for both inhabitants and enterprises.

Energy independence may also increase global competitiveness for nations
that invest in renewable technology. By exporting clean energy or green
technologies, energy-independent countries may create new income streams
while portraying themselves as pioneers in the worldwide transition to
sustainability.

Furthermore, [[localized energy generation]{.underline} **[promotes
infrastructure]{.underline}**]{.mark} upgrades that help other sectors,
such as transportation and manufacturing, causing ripple effects across
the economy.

Energy Independence [[and **Resilience** in Natural
Disasters]{.underline}]{.mark}

[Natural catastrophes]{.underline} like hurricanes, floods, and
wildfires often [damage centralized energy infra]{.underline}structure,
leaving whole areas without electricity for days or weeks. [[Energy
independence]{.underline}]{.mark}, aided by distributed renewable
technologies such as rooftop solar panels and battery storage, [[boosts

Communities with [[self-sufficient energy sources]{.underline} [can
keep]{.underline}]{.mark} key activities
[[running]{.underline}]{.mark}---hospitals, [[emergency

## Uniqueness

### Uniqueness\-\--2NC

#### BOEM Offshore leasing is facilitating energy development now\-\--but the process is complicated.

Michael **Freeman 25**, journalist for American Progress, 9/23/22,
"Offshore Wind Can Lower Energy Prices and Beat Out Oil and Gas",
https://www.americanprogress.org/article/offshore-wind-can-lower-energy-prices-and-beat-out-oil-and-gas//WF

[[The Outer Continental Shelf (OCS)]{.mark} exists between state and
international waters, [and its resources---including renewable and
fossil fuel energy---are managed by the U.S. Department of the
Interior's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management
(BOEM).]{.mark}]{.underline} In recent years, offshore wind leases were
sold for nearly 12,500 percent more per acre than their fossil fuel
counterparts, while still providing comparable costs for consumers. A
closer comparative look at the two leasing processes reveals exactly how
[Americans lose out when the country invests in offshore
oil]{.underline}.

[[BOEM's oil and gas leasing schedule is determined by its five-year
plan]{.mark}, and [each lease sale undergoes multiple steps in
coordination]{.mark} with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969
(NEPA).]{.underline} During these competitive lease sales, companies
submit bids for the right to extract these publicly owned resources, and
the winning bid, or bonus, is paid to secure a lease. Companies
determine the maximum bidding point at which they are willing to pay for
a lease by taking into account future price uncertainty, resource
uncertainty, and environmental risk.7 The average winning bid from
offshore oil and gas lease sales from 2019 to the present is \$47 per
acre.

The offshore wind leasing process is similar: During lease sales,
companies submit bids for the right to construct and deploy wind
turbines, with the winning bid paid to secure that lease.8 However,
because the wind energy market is more stable, policy and capital
markets are favorable, and the environmental risk is low, wind leases
sell for considerably more per acre than their oil and gas
counterparts.9 The average winning bid from all of BOEM's offshore wind
sales is \$5,906 per acre.

However, [[offshore wind energy has an advantage over fossil fuels on
more than a price-per-acre basis]{.mark}; it]{.underline} is also
bringing in more money for the energy it is expected to produce.
Offshore wind bid payments per expected megawatt-hour (MWh) are 217
percent higher than they are for oil and gas.10 [[Increased focus on
renewables could therefore increase revenue generated through offshore
leasing tremendously, maximizing returns on public
resources.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Democratic colleagues]{.underline} in writing to House Appropriations
Subcommittee on Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Chair
Congressman Mike Simpson (ID-02) and Ranking Member Chellie Pingree
(ME-01) [requesting they robustly fund the Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management's (**BOEM**) Office of Renewable Energy
Programs]{.underline}, as well as [include language in the **FY26
budget** to find increased efficiencies in the permitting process for
offshore wind projects, which are an economic and national security
imperative.]{.underline}

["We request that you take action to ensure robust funding for the
Department of Interior's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's (**BOEM**)
Office of Renewable Energy Programs]{.underline} that supports the
timely review and permitting of offshore wind projects. We also ask that
you include report language in the bill that supports finding increased
efficiencies in [the federal permitting process to allow for projects to
come online as fast and proficiently as **possible**]{.underline},
without compromising the safety and integrity of the review process,"
the Members began.

Permitting, constructing, and connecting offshore wind to the energy
grid is imperative to ensuring the United States' long-term energy needs
are met. Domestic energy demands are projected to rise 50% by 2050 as a
result of crypto and AI, and offshore wind will be an essential part of
generating the energy necessary to meet the future. However, the
benefits of offshore wind extend beyond energy capacity.

"By the end of 2024, the industry had already announced more than \$9.5
billion in supply chain investments, including investing in the creation
of nearly 40 new domestic vessels to serve offshore wind projects.
[These jobs are inextricably **intertwined** with project permitting
**timelines**, and investing in **BOEM's** permitting capacity will
increase **job security** for thousands of Americans and investment
confidence for **developers**,"]{.underline} the Members wrote.

Additionally, offshore wind provides a local, reliable, and infinite
source of energy, independent of geopolitical rivals and fluctuations in
global energy markets. Fully funding the BOEM's Office of Renewable
Energy Programs and streamlining project permitting will strengthen
American manufacturing and make us a world leader in spearheading the
green energy transition. Failing to prioritize offshore wind in the
federal budget will allow China and other nations to fill the gap.

"[Committing our support to technologies like offshore wind will also
help diversify our grid]{.underline}, making it more safe, reliable, and
resilient. It is imperative that we provide BOEM with the resources they
need to facilitate the timely, efficient, reliable and accurate review
of offshore wind project applications so we don't slow down this
momentum," the Members wrote.

[The Department of the Interior just announced that it's revving the
engine on another offshore lease sale in the Gulf of Mexico, which was
recently renamed by the Trump Administration to the Gulf of America,
slated for 2025.]{.underline}

Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum made it crystal clear[: the era of
locking up domestic energy is over. The Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management (BOEM) is dusting off its charts, pointing to an estimated
29.6 billion barrels of undiscovered oil and nearly 55 trillion cubic
feet of gas lurking beneath the waves. That's a lot of hydrocarbons just
waiting to fund highways, schools, and more.]{.underline}

[BOEM plans to issue the proposed notice of sale in June. These Outer
Continental Shelf sales don't just boost U.S. energy independence---they
shovel billions into the Treasury, with a side of revenue-sharing to
keep coastal states happy and well-funded.]{.underline}

This move is a not-so-subtle jab at the Biden administration's approach
to leasing. Burgum isn't shy about blaming the previous administration
for high costs, or about promising that Trump-era "Energy Dominance" is
back on the menu. Translation: get ready for more rigs, more jobs, and a
big push to reassert America's dominance in global energy markets.

Meanwhile, oil prices have tanked well below the Permian's average
breakeven, as a result of President Trump's Liberation Day tariffs and
OPEC+'s decision to increase production quotas for May by three times as
much as expected. At 4:45 pm ET, WTI crude was trading down 6.62% at
\$62.52 per barrel, with Brent trading at \$66.15 (-5.69%).

[For the current US administration, the lease sale isn't just about oil
and gas---it's about wresting back control of energy policy with a
sledgehammer---maybe with a little offshore drilling flair while they're
at it.]{.underline}

#### **BOEM is pursuing energy now.**

States Secretary of the Interior; U.S. Department of the Interior,
"Interior Announces Eleventh National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and
Gas Leasing Program,"
https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-announces-eleventh-national-outer-continental-shelf-oil-and-gas-leasing\]
//wastella

WASHINGTON --- Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum today directed the
[Bureau of Ocean Energy Management]{.underline} to initiate the first
step in a robust public engagement process to develop a new schedule for
offshore oil and gas lease sales on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf.

"[Launching the process to develop the 11th National Outer Continental
Shelf Program marks a decisive step toward securing American Energy
Dominance]{.underline}," said Secretary of the [Interior Doug
Burgum]{.underline}. "Through a transparent and inclusive public
engagement process, we are [reinforcing our commitment to responsible
offshore energy development]{.underline}---[driving job creation,
bolstering economic growth and strengthening American energy
independence]{.underline}. Under President Donald J. Trump's leadership,
we are [unlocking the full potential of our offshore resources to
benefit the American]{.underline} people for generations to come."

BOEM will soon publish in the Federal Register a Request for Information
and Comments on the preparation of the 11th National OCS Oil and Gas
Leasing Program. This publication will initiate a 45-day public comment
period and serve as the initial step in the multi-year planning process.

Notably, BOEM's jurisdiction on the OCS has recently changed. A new
planning area offshore Alaska---the High Arctic---is being established
as the 27th OCS planning area. Additionally, boundaries of other
existing planning areas are being updated to align with BOEM's revised
jurisdiction. Details on these changes will be included in a forthcoming
Federal Register notice and posted to BOEM's website.

As mandated by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, the Department of
the Interior must solicit input from interested and affected parties
during development of the National OCS Program. Consistent with prior
efforts, BOEM will request information on all OCS planning areas at this
initial stage.

Once finalized, the 11th National OCS Program will replace the current
10th Program (2024--2029), which includes just three lease sales over
five years---all located in the Gulf of America. While BOEM continues
work to complete those sales, development of the 11th Program will
proceed concurrently.

The RFI does not propose a specific timeline for future lease sales or
make any early determinations regarding which areas may be included.
Instead, it invites stakeholders to provide insight and recommendations
for leasing opportunities, raise concerns and identify other existing
uses that may be affected by offshore leasing.

The OCS is a vital national resource, playing a critical role in
America's energy security. As of April 1, 2025, BOEM manages 2,227
active oil and gas leases covering approximately 12.1 million acres in
OCS regions. Of these, 469 leases are currently producing oil and gas.

These leases generate billions of dollars in revenue for the U.S.
Treasury and state governments while supporting hundreds of thousands of
American jobs. In fiscal year 2024 alone, production from OCS leases
accounted for approximately 14% of domestic oil production and 2% of
domestic natural gas production, yielding \$7 billion in federal
revenues.

Additionally, the [OCS holds vast quantities of undiscovered energy
resources. BOEM's most recent assessment estimates a mean of 68.79
billion barrels of oil and 229.03 trillion cubic feet of natural
gas]{.underline}.

President Trump's Executive Order 14154, ["Unleashing American Energy,"
underscores the national interest in maximizing the use of affordable,
reliable domestic energy]{.underline}. The order establishes [U.S.
policy to \"encourage energy exploration and production on federal lands
and waters]{.underline}, including the Outer Continental Shelf, to meet
the needs of our citizens and [solidify the United States as a global
energy leader long into the future]{.underline}."

Earlier this year, [the Trump administration reaffirmed its commitment
to offshore energy development]{.underline}. On April 4, 2025, Secretary
Burgum directed BOEM to move forward with a lease sale in the Gulf of
America.

[Energy Dominance remains a cornerstone of U.S. economic strength and
global leadership]{.underline}. By expanding offshore capabilities, the
[United States is ensuring affordable energy for consumers, creating
high-paying jobs, and reducing dependence on foreign
adversaries]{.underline}. Under President Trump's leadership, the
Department of the Interior is cutting red tape, unleashing America's
natural resources, and putting Americans back to work.

#### BOEM energy dominance increasing now.

//wastella

[The US Department of the Interior has announced what it describes as a
"significant increase" in estimated oil and gas reserves in the US Gulf
of Mexico's Outer Continental Shelf, underscoring the region's critical
role in advancing US national security and "American Energy
Dominance."]{.underline}

Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) analysis reveals an additional
1.30 billion barrels of oil equivalent since 2021, bringing the total
reserve estimate to 7.04 billion barrels of oil equivalent. This
includes 5.77 billion barrels of oil and 7.15 trillion cubic feet of
natural gas---a 22.6% increase in remaining recoverable reserves.

"This new data confirms what we've known all along---America is sitting
on a treasure trove of energy, and under President Trump's leadership,
we're unlocking it," said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. "The
Gulf of America is a powerhouse, and by streamlining permitting and
expanding access, we're not just powering our economy---we're
strengthening our national security and putting thousands of Americans
back to work."

[BOEM's updated assessment evaluated over 140 oil and gas fields,
identifying 18 new discoveries and analyzing more than 37,000 reservoirs
across 1,336 fields in the Gulf. The agency said that this
"comprehensive review" added 4.39 billion barrels of oil equivalent in
original reserves. After subtracting production of 3.09 billion barrels
of oil equivalent since 2020--2021, "the net increase reflects continued
opportunity and momentum in offshore development," BOEM
said.]{.underline}

"The Gulf of America is delivering 14% of the nation's oil," said Dr.
James Kendall, BOEM Gulf of America Regional Director. "These updated
estimates reaffirm the Gulf's vital role in ensuring a reliable,
affordable domestic energy supply."

Earlier this year, [the Trump administration reaffirmed its commitment
to expanding offshore energy. On April 4, 2025, Secretary Doug Burgum
directed BOEM to move forward with an oil and gas lease sale in the
Gulf.]{.underline} BOEM says that it anticipates publishing a proposed
notice of Lease Sale 262 in June 2025.

[The BOEM statement also said: "Opening the Outer Continental Shelf is a
core component of the administration's strategy to achieve Energy
Dominance. Expanded leasing is projected to create tens of thousands of
jobs across exploration, production, logistics and supply chains ---
revitalizing coastal economies and fueling American
innovation."]{.underline}

//xav!

WASHINGTON --- Following President Trump's [signing of the **[One Big
Beautiful Bill]{.mark} Act**, or H.R. 1, the Department of the Interior
is implementing key changes that [will promote U.S. energy
production]{.mark}]{.underline}, timber development and other regulatory
actions needed to ensure the responsible management of our natural
resources and public lands.

The [sweeping legislation is a [major win and critical component
of]{.mark} the Trump administration's [Energy Dominance
agenda]{.mark}]{.underline}. Within the Department of the Interior, the
Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the
Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, the Bureau of
Reclamation, the Office of Surface Mining and other relevant offices are
working diligently to enforce this landmark congressional action.

"The [[O]{.mark}ne [B]{.mark}ig [B]{.mark}eautiful [B]{.mark}ill Act is
a historic piece of legislation that [will restore **energy
independence**]{.mark}]{.underline} and make life more affordable for
American families by reversing disastrous Biden-era policies that
constricted domestic energy production," said Interior Secretary Doug
Burgum. "This marks a significant shift in how we manage our public
lands, support energy development and work with local communities. The
Department is proud to implement President Trump's agenda and get the
federal government back to working for the American people."

The following are significant changes enacted by the One Big Beautiful
Bill Act, which Interior will be implementing through an expedited
rulemaking process:

Offshore oil and gas development

The federal royalty rate is reduced to no less than 12.5% and no greater
than 16.67%. This change gives the Department of the Interior increased
discretion to encourage domestic Outer Continental Shelf production and
investment by lowering the royalty rate charged to producers. In 2022,
the Inflation Reduction Act mandated a 16.67% minimum royalty rate,
discouraging investment in domestic oil and gas production.

In the Gulf of America, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is
mandated to hold at least two offshore lease sales each year through
2039. The first of these lease sales is scheduled on December 10, 2025.
The second of these lease sales will be held by March 15, 2026, and the
third will be held by August 15, 2026.

Alaska leasing resumes with a minimum of six offshore lease sales
occurring in the Cook Inlet Planning Area Leasing from 2026-2032. The
first of these lease sales will be held by March 15, 2026.

[[Under]{.mark} the [O]{.mark}ne [B]{.mark}ig [B]{.mark}eautiful
[B]{.mark}ill Act]{.underline}, Bureau of Safety and Environmental
Enforcement, or [[BSEE, must approve commingling]{.mark}
[requests]{.mark} unless safety or resource recovery would be harmed.
[Downhole commingling]{.mark} is [the production of oil or natural gas
from multiple reservoirs through a single well]{.mark}. The [process
allows for]{.mark} more **[efficient and cost-effective
production]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Onshore oil and gas development

[The [royalty rate for new federal onshore production]{.mark} will also
[return to a minimum 12.5%]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} reversing the
16.67% rate established in the Inflation Reduction Act. [This royalty
rate reduction will lead to an estimated 225 additional leases in 2026,
and over the following few years, will [lead to]{.mark} an [average of
160 wells drilled on]{.mark} these **[additional
leases]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Onshore lease sales will be required quarterly in Wyoming, New Mexico,
Colorado, Utah, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Nevada and Alaska.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminates expression of interest fees,
paid by lessees to nominate land for leasing, also an unnecessary
measure pushed by Democrats in the Inflation Reduction Act to restrict
new energy production

[Upon approval, a permit to drill will now be valid for a four-year
period]{.underline}.

The royalty requirement is repealed on extracted methane established by
the Inflation Reduction Act, which recklessly forced producers to pay
extremely burdensome fees or to shut-in production.

The Bureau of Land Management, or BLM, must now lease nominated parcels
within 18 months and may not add new restrictions outside of the
conditions of approval included in the resource management plans.

New legal definitions for "eligible" and "available" lands are being
adopted to reduce leasing disputes.

The BLM will update oil and gas regulations that would make it easier
for operators to combine, or commingle, production from multiple leases.
This measure reduces costs, improves production and decreases surface
use.

Coal

[[The royalty rate will be reduced]{.mark} from 12.5% to 7%, which
significantly decreases the per-ton cost of producing coal, [improving
financial viability for producers]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Federal leasing will be restored, including a mandate to increase the
availability for lease of 4 million acres of public lands with known
coal reserves.

Coal lease reviews will be streamlined.

Water Infrastructure and Hydropower

The Bureau of Reclamation will adopt an accelerated permitting process
for major water infrastructure projects, including dams, canals and
reservoirs, by allowing Reclamation to use the voluntary National
Environmental Policy Act fee system.

Access to hydropower development will be expanded on federal dams, with
streamlined licensing and priority for water storage projects that
include power generation.

Reclamation will be able to expedite review of Title XVI water recycling
projects and desalination feasibility studies, removing certain previous
cost caps.

Reclamation is directed to issue guidance on leveraging public-private
partnerships for infrastructure upgrades, including drought resilience
and water reuse systems.

The [[One Big Beautiful Bill Act allocates \$1 billion]{.mark} to the
Bureau of Reclamation through 2034 for construction and associated
activities that restore or increase the capacity or use of existing
conveyance facilities or for construction that increases the capacity of
existing surface water storage facilities]{.underline}.

Forestry and Public Lands

The BLM will expand timber sales, increasing by 20 million board feet
annually.

Furthermore, the BLM will prioritize long-term timber contracts and open
additional harvests.

In addition to the actions above, the Department will address provisions
in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to eliminate longstanding right-of-way
and capacity fee discounts for existing and future wind and solar
projects, bringing an end to years of subsidies for economically
unviable energy development.

[From [**boosting** American energy production]{.mark} and revitalizing
the clean coal sector, to [accelerating]{.mark} domestic [mineral
development]{.mark}, expanding timber harvesting and cutting burdensome
regulations, the Department of the Interior---under Secretary Burgum's
leadership---is delivering results and advancing President Trump's bold
agenda through the One Big Beautiful Bill]{.underline}.

permitting regardless of election results, experts say,"

jxu

Dive Brief:

- [**[Offshore]{.mark} wind [experts]{.mark}** [expressed concern
  about]{.mark} the **[lengthy permitting]{.mark}** for several U.S.
  projects on the Atlantic Coast]{.underline}, as they face deadlines
  for securing federal tax credits and a potential regulatory slowdown
  following the presidential election.

- Offshore wind developers explained at the American Wind Energy
  Association (AWEA) Offshore WINDPOWER 2020 conference on Wednesday
  that the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) within the
  Department of the Interior will require funding help to keep
  permitting on track for a number of projects.

- The panelists said they were concerned that [**[BOEM staff]{.mark}**
  could [further **stagger**]{.mark} the [**processes** to determine
  **permitting**]{.mark} for offshore wind projects]{.underline}. A
  decision is expected from BOEM on the first construction permit for a
  large-scale U.S. offshore wind project, Vineyard Wind, around Dec. 18.

Dive Insight:

BOEM is reviewing the Construction and Operation Plans (COP) for a
number of projects in the Atlantic, which are contingent on the agency
issuing its first Environmental Impact Statement for a large-scale
offshore wind project in federal waters. 

"I think [there is a [**recognition** that **BOEM** doesn't have]{.mark}
all the [**resources** to put out ***six or seven*** **COPs** at one
time]{.mark}," particularly in the **same wind energy
areas**]{.underline}, Geri Edens, counsel for Vineyard Wind, said on the
panel.

But while staggering the permitting of the rest of the projects might
make sense for BOEM, it is "not necessarily ideal for the industry,
because everyone's been waiting for a while now to get these things
forward," she said.

BOEM had pushed back its review of Vineyard Wind's Massachusetts
construction plan for 1.5 years, deciding that [[**permitting** for
**offshore wind** needed to be done in a more **holistic
capacity**]{.mark}, including **considerations** for further
**expansion** of the resource]{.underline}.

The [[**delay** has led other **projects** to revise their
timelines]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as the 120 MW Skipjack Offshore
Energy wind farm, which originally sought commercial operation as early
as November 2022.

The bandwidth of BOEM will be stretched in January 2021 regardless of
how the election turns out, experts say.

According to the Permitting Dashboard for Federal Infrastructure
Projects produced by DOI and other agencies, federal permitting
applications for Vineyard Wind and Deepwater Wind's South Fork Wind Farm
are both in progress. BOEM has received COPs for 10 offshore wind
projects to date.

South Fork's Draft Environmental Impact Statement is scheduled for
publication by BOEM on Jan. 8, and would incorporate the analysis of
future offshore wind development being conducted for Vineyard Wind.

Developers are waiting for BOEM to publish Notices of Intent (NOIs)
about preparing individual Environmental Impact Statements for their
respective project construction.

"The idea of staggering the NOIs sounds mildly apocalyptic," said Seth
Kaplan, director of government and regulatory affairs for the offshore
wind joint venture between Engie and EDP Renewables, Ocean Winds NA. On
the panel, Kaplan said developers as well as communities have been
counting on construction starting on a certain timeline, expected to
drive employment and other economic activity.

One solution, he said, would be contracting certain jobs so that NOIs
can be issued more efficiently, whether funded by congressional
appropriations or otherwise. BOEM needs "to be extremely rigorous" with
what processes can be performed by contractors and how "the true experts
who need to touch the decisions and need to make the ultimate
determinations" are spending their time, he said.

Congress gave a \$3 million bump to BOEM in the most recent federal
budget, according to Claire Richer, AWEA federal affairs director.

But [within BOEM, other industries such as offshore oil drilling, which
is more well-established in the U.S., have already been appropriated
funding]{.underline}, and it's [unlikely that money can be re-allocated
toward permitting for the more nascent offshore wind
industry]{.underline}. While BOEM offshore wind lease auctions have been
very lucrative, the money does not go directly to BOEM, but to the U.S.
Treasury.

Whoever leads BOEM in 2021 will have their work cut out for them,
experts agreed. "There's a lot of action that is needed immediately from
day one" from DOI and BOEM political appointees, Kaplan said.

The efforts and agendas of those appointees will depend on the
presidential election as well as the outcome of the Senate races, Richer
said.

#### Budget is [zero sum]{.underline}.

**BOEM '25** \[Bureau of Ocean Energy Management; 2025; The Bureau of

jxu

The [2026 [Budget proposes \$148.2 million for **development of
energy**, **mineral**, and **geological** resources on]{.mark} the
**[OCS]{.mark}**]{.underline}. These [**funds** [support
**high-priority** offshore]{.mark} **oil** and **gas
[development]{.mark} activities**]{.underline}, including
[**[leasing]{.mark}**, plan administration, economic analyses, and
resource evaluation]{.underline}. BOEM is [advancing the
Administration's oil and gas energy policies on the OCS]{.underline},
including the implementation of Executive Order (EO) 14154,
**[Unleashing American Energy]{.underline}**, through activities
supporting the development of OCS oil and gas resources. In 2026, BOEM
will continue development of a new 5-year National OCS Program to
[**[replace]{.mark}** the [last Administration's]{.mark} **historically
[restrictive]{.mark}** [leasing program]{.mark} that **harmfully
restrains** America from developing its **vast offshore energy
resources**]{.underline}. BOEM formally initiated the development of its
updated leasing program on April 30, 2025, with the publication of the
request for information. The requested [**[funding]{.mark}** will
[**enable** BOEM to **conduct**]{.mark} the **[necessary
analyses]{.mark}** and studies for areas under
consideration]{.underline}, outreach and coordination with communities
and stakeholders, public comment review and analysis, and expedited
lease sale NEPA assessments. The [[Budget **eliminates support**
for]{.mark} BOEM's **[renewable energy]{.mark} program** and **[Green
New Scam]{.mark} technologies** that facilitate unreliable, intermittent
energy to the detriment of American consumers, businesses, and
communities]{.underline}. This includes [**eliminating** funding that
supports **[disastrous offshore wind energy projects]{.mark}** that harm
coastal communities, wildlife, and military readiness]{.underline}.

[BOEM also oversees the conveyance of OCS marine minerals and is
focusing efforts on expanding deep seabed critical mineral information
and access]{.underline}. In April 2025, the Department published
information on prospective areas for recovering critical minerals on the
OCS. Minerals such as platinum, cobalt, and manganese are abundant in
all ocean basins in shallow and deep waters. BOEM will continue to
champion EO 14285, [Unleashing America's Offshore Critical Minerals and
Resources, to advance critical mineral priorities]{.underline} through
the assessment of OCS resources and collection of baseline information
pertaining to ecological conditions and communities associated with OCS
critical mineral deposits. Through this work, [BOEM will be better
positioned to evaluate future requests to prospect for, lease, and
potentially develop offshore critical minerals]{.underline}. The 2026
[Budget will [**prioritize** characterization of]{.mark} the
[**minerals** offshore and facilitate **industry access** to
**reduce**]{.mark} the Nation's **[reliance on foreign
resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The Budget also retains funding for
sand and gravel resources that are used for beach nourishment and
coastal restoration activities. Sand and gravel resources support
restoration of hundreds of miles of the Nation's coastline, protecting
billions of dollars of infrastructure and important ecological habitat.

BOEM's Environmental Programs support BOEM's mission and the
Administration's goals by ensuring decisions are guided and informed by
the best available science. These programs support the scientific
research required by statute to inform policy decisions regarding
energy, mineral, and geological resource development on the OCS. This
focus on research ensures the transparent and accessible integration of
applied science with BOEM's analyses supporting durable energy
development decisions, which are also supported by the Environmental
Programs budget activity. The 2026 request for Environmental Programs
supports development of a new National OCS Program. These resources will
enable BOEM to conduct the necessary programmatic environmental
analyses, outreach and coordination with stakeholders, and public
comment review and analysis; fund environmental studies specific to the
planning areas under consideration; and fund lease sale NEPA
assessments.

Workforce Restructure

The [2026 [budget **supports**]{.mark} the [**Administration's
priority** to **streamline** government and]{.mark} will [**continue
efforts** to **unify** and **optimize administrative services** **across
the Department**]{.mark} to increase **effectiveness** and
**efficiency** for the **benefit** of American

The latest projects under review are "[benefiting from the hard work
this administration has done to streamline reviews and maximize
interagency collaboration]{.underline}," a BOEM spokesperson said.

MAP: Offshore wind projects in US North Atlantic

The Biden administration has \"improved staffing capacity\" at the BOEM
and in late 2022 the bureau set up the FAST-41 agency governance scheme
\"[which has allowed for early identification and resolution of issues
and improved overall interagency coordination]{.underline},\" the
spokesperson said.

Last year, BOEM published its 'Notice of Intent (NOI) Checklist' for
offshore wind developers to clarify what information is required prior
to environmental review. The checklist establishes a pre-application
process and avoid delays later down the line.

Federal authorities have also set out deadlines for the 11 permit
approvals required by each project.

For instance, BOEM is committed to completing the Environmental Impact
Statement review for Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners\' 2.6 GW
Vineyard Northeast project within two years, setting a deadline of March
23, 2026.

States, federal agencies and industry stakeholders have been
collaborating over the last few years "to [make data collection more
**effective** and to apply lessons learned from early projects to inform
**future projects**]{.underline},\" the NYSERDA spokesperson said.

In another step forward, BOEM published a draft Programmatic
Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) in January for the wider New York
Bight area that should help to streamline permitting for multiple lease
areas.

\"Standardizing how this group of projects will be permitted should
provide greater transparency and operational efficiencies for the
developers and agencies that could reduce cost and/or improve
timelines,\" the NYSERDA spokesperson said.

[The process would also lessen the burden on communities and affected
ocean users by allowing them to participate in a single process that
considers the group of projects,]{.underline} the spokesperson said.

#### The BOEM is investing in [seabed mineral mining]{.underline}, but it's reliant on [federal funding.]{.underline}

**Alberts '7-8** \[Elizabeth C. Alberts is a staff writer for Mongabay,
7-8-2025, \"U.S. federal agency clears ways for deep-sea mining --- and
companies are lining up\", Mongabay Environmental News,
https://news.mongabay.com/2025/07/u-s-federal-agency-clears-ways-for-deep-sea-mining-and-companies-are-lining-up/\]//LASA-AR

On June 25, [the United States **D**epartment **o**f the **I**nterior
(**DOI**),]{.underline} a department within the federal government that
manages the nation's natural resources, announced plans to accelerate
the initiation of deep-sea mining in U.S. waters, effectively enacting
President Trump's executive order that calls for fast-tracking the
industry. As part of this effort to briskly move things along, [the
**B**ureau of **O**cean **E**nergy **M**anagement (**BOEM**), an agency
within DOI, will be introducing **various policy changes**, such as
expediting the permitting process, extending the **duration** of
prospecting permits]{.underline} and reducing the timelines for
environmental reviews. [Critics have **raised concerns**
over]{.underline} these developments, not only due to the controversial
nature of [deep-sea mining, but also because of the **hurried pace** at
which BOEM is advancing these plans.]{.underline}

While [deep-sea mining has **not yet started** anywhere in the world,
many experts warn that the industry could cause **irreversible harm** to
marine ecosystems that are **already under substantial stress** from
human-driven climate change and other **environmental
pressures**]{.underline}. Industry proponents, however, argue that
deep-sea mining is vital for securing reliable supplies of critical
minerals needed for the green transition, energy security and defense.

The [majority of deep-sea mining interest has focused on **polymetallic
nodules**]{.underline} --- potato-sized rocks containing nickel, copper,
cobalt and manganese --- but mineral deposits can also be found on the
cobalt-rich crusts of seamounts or ridges, or the sulfide deposits
around hydrothermal vents.

In a statement published online, the department said these measures were
designed to "reduce delays, improve coordination and provide greater
certainty for industry, all while upholding key environmental
safeguards." [The DOI also stated that the actions would "position the
United States to lead in the responsible development of **offshore
critical minerals**]{.underline}" while "securing access to essential
resources that power our economy, bolster national defense and support
emerging technologies."

Under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953, [BOEM has indicated
that it has jurisdiction over an area that covers approximately **1.3
billion hectares**]{.underline} (3.2 billion acres), which is about 1.6
times the size of mainland U.S., but only a subset of this area has been
explored for seabed critical minerals. To date, [BOEM has not issued any
commercial leases for deep-sea critical mineral exploration or
exploitation]{.underline}.

However, that soon might change. One company, [Impossible Metals, is
preparing to move forward under BOEM's updated **regulatory
framework**.]{.underline} On April 8, the U.S.- and Canada-based
company, which claims to have developed technology that will not overly
harm the seabed while harvesting minerals, submitted an application for
a mineral lease sale with the intention of mining off the coast of
American Samoa, along the United States' outer continental shelf. On
June 16, [BOEM opened a 30-day public comment period, which the agency
identified as the **first step** in a process that could lead to the
approval of the nation's first **deep-sea mining lease**.]{.underline}

Other companies also appear to be positioning themselves to take
advantage of these regulatory changes.

According to email communications obtained by Mongabay through the
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) process, [BOEM has]{.underline} been
in close contact with a newly incorporated Delaware-incorporated firm
called Wetstone, formerly known as the "Seafloor Minerals Fund." The
company, led by former Shell executive Graham Talbot, has previously
[declared that it plans to invest **\$400 million** in the deep-sea
mining sector]{.underline} --- an investment that now [appears to
include **U.S. mineral exploration.**]{.underline}

The Vital Need for Energy Abundance

Even under worst-case-scenario assumptions, the **[danger of [climate
change pales in comparison to]{.mark} the danger of [energy
scarcity]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Energy scarcity [[threatens]{.mark}
**resilient [access]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} food, water, health care, and
other **[necessities of life]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Environmental
protection, like human [[advancement]{.mark}, [can **only** happen with
**energy abundance**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Energy abundance **[[must
be]{.mark} a [national priority]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Today, [[America's position]{.mark} as a dominant producer of oil and
gas is [**threatened** by **misguided government policies**]{.mark} that
have restricted oil and gas production on federal lands]{.underline} and
federally controlled offshore areas and attempted to stifle oil and gas
production on private land through overregulation.

Another [[**major obstacle** facing]{.mark} America's [**energy
production** is]{.mark} the federal process for [permitting]{.mark}
major infrastructure [projects]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [[U.S.
permitting]{.underline}]{.mark} and environmental review process for
major infrastructure projects [is the [**most expensive**, **lengthy**,
and **unpredictable worldwide**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Multiple federal
agencies each issue separate permits, delaying projects and introducing
high cost and legal uncertainty. [[Capital availability shrinks and cost
of capital rises]{.mark} under this risk, [**harming** U.S.
**competitiveness**]{.mark}]{.underline}---especially [[compared to
**China**'s quick]{.mark}, **lower-cost infrastructure
[deployment]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Over many decades Congress has created a "hydra-headed" system that
requires a dozen or more permits for each major infrastructure project,
creating uncoordinated, overlapping reviews. Congress has added layers
of permit requirements without mandating interagency coordination or
predictable deadlines. There is [**[more than enough capital]{.mark}**
in the private economy [to **fund all**]{.mark} **the investments** we
need for [energy]{.mark} abundance, [but **federal red tape**
creates]{.mark} often-[prohibitive risk]{.mark} for
investors]{.underline}, risk that [**significantly raises** the cost of
capital for those projects that do get built]{.underline}.

#### Offshore management is expensive and resource intensive.

Julie **Cart 24**, environmental journalist for CalMatters, 7/10/24,
"California has just approved a new blueprint for offshore wind. The
massive projects will cost billions",
https://calmatters.org/environment/2024/07/california-offshore-wind-plan-approved//WF

The [[offshore]{.mark} wind [industry must be created]{.mark} **almost
[from scratch]{.mark}**]{.underline}: a new manufacturing base for the
still-evolving technology; a robust and reliable supply chain;
transportation networks on land and sea; [specially configured ports to
make, assemble and maintain the gargantuan seagoing
platforms]{.underline}; finding and training a highly specialized
workforce; building a large transmission network where none exists and
beefing up those that operate now.

The Energy Commission's plan estimates that [just the work [to
upgrade]{.mark} California's [ports will cost]{.mark} **\$11-[\$12
billion]{.mark}**, much of it publicly funded.]{.underline} The plan
identifies the large ports of Humboldt, Long Beach and Los Angeles as
viable for storing, staging and assembling parts needed for offshore
wind operations.

By 2045, 16 large and 10 small ports will be needed along California's
coast for various aspects of development and support, according to the
plan. ["**[Funding and]{.mark} [permitting]{.mark}** for these projects
[are a **critical challenge**]{.mark} to address,"]{.underline} the plan
says. An estimated \$475 million would be set aside for port
infrastructure in a climate bond measure that will be on the November
ballot.

#### Development of the OCS is complex and expensive. 

Susan **Tierney 13**, former Assistant Secretary of Energy for Policy
and International Affairs of the United States, 06/2013, "Planning for
Offshore Energy Development",
https://www.analysisgroup.com/globalassets/content/insights/publishing/planning_for_ocean_energy_development_complete.pdf//WF

Permitting of energy facilities in the OCS is important to get right,
for countless economic and environmental reasons. [[The]{.mark} enormous
renewable and fossil-fuel **energy [resources]{.mark}** [located in the
OCS offer]{.mark} large, domestic supplies with [potential]{.mark} to
**meet consumer demand**, [create economic opportunities]{.mark}, bring
value to local and national economies]{.underline}, and (in the case of
offshore renewable energy) provide a low-carbon energy resource.
[[**Major investment** is required]{.mark} to bring such domestic energy
supplies to market]{.underline}, and [[allowing private parties]{.mark}
the opportunity [to tap these resources]{.mark} for broader use
[depends]{.mark} upon efficient and **[effective management]{.mark}** as
well as considerable attention to avoiding and mitigating environmental
impacts.]{.underline} These resources occupy public lands, for which the
federal government holds significant stewardship responsibility. These
offshore resources share a location with many other users and uses of
natural resources in the ocean. The potential development risks are real
and environmental impacts can be large. Access to these resources should
clearly depend upon responsible permitting and prudent development, in
which environmental standards are not compromised.

It is hard to overstate the extent to which [**[projects]{.mark}** to
develop oil/gas resources and wind energy [in the OCS are **major
undertakings**]{.mark}, from a technical, economic, and risk-management
point of view.]{.underline} Therefore, [[the process to obtain access to
the OCS]{.mark} for developing oil and gas resources [is]{.mark}
inherently [**complex**, **expensive**, **time-consuming**]{.mark}, and
still evolving.]{.underline} Even so, the existence of inefficiencies in
the process introduces unnecessary costs for those portions of the OCS
where federal officials seek to make energy resources available for
development.

#### Offshore rigging presents unique logistical personnel problems.

Joshna **Dsouza 23**, editor for Zoe Talent Solutions, 10/3/23, "7 Key
Challenges in Offshore Oil Rig Management",
<https://zoetalentsolutions.com/key-challenges-in-offshore-oil-rig-management//WF>

[[**Operating** an]{.mark} offshore [oil rig]{.mark} is no small feat.
It [requires]{.mark} **meticulous [planning]{.mark}**, coordination,
[and]{.mark} effective **[communication]{.mark}** to ensure smooth
operations in a remote and isolated environment.]{.underline} However,
[[the distance from shore poses]{.mark} **significant [logistical
challenges]{.mark}**]{.underline} that must be overcome:

[[One]{.mark} of the main [challenge]{.mark}s faced]{.underline} in
remote operations [[is managing the **supply
chain**]{.mark}.]{.underline} With limited access to essential resources
and equipment, [careful planning is required to ensure that everything
needed for daily operations is available on-site. This includes
**[fuel]{.mark}**, drilling fluids, spare parts, **[food]{.mark}**
supplies]{.underline} -- you name it! [Coordinating these [deliveries
can be complex due to **weather**]{.mark} **conditions** [and
**transportation logistics**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Another challenge lies in]{.mark} maintaining efficient [communication
between]{.mark} the [offshore]{.mark} rig [and onshore]{.mark}
teams.]{.underline} The vast distance makes it difficult to convey
information promptly or troubleshoot issues effectively. Delays in
communication can lead to costly downtime or even compromise safety
protocols. To tackle this challenge, technological advancements have
been instrumental in establishing reliable satellite communications
systems that enable real-time data transmission between locations.

Furthermore, [[remote operations bring forth]{.mark} unique
**[personnel]{.mark}** management **[challenges]{.mark}** as
well.]{.underline} Crew members often spend weeks or months away from
their families living onboard the rig. This isolation can impact morale
and mental health if not properly addressed by management through
regular welfare initiatives such as recreation facilities or internet
connectivity for crew members' personal use.

#### New Tax laws make offshore drilling even more expensive. 

**JPT 24**, Journal of Petroleum Technology, 4/23/24, "BOEM Updates Rule
Related to Offshore Decommissioning Costs",
https://jpt.spe.org/boem-updates-rule-related-to-offshore-decommissioning-costs?//WF

Companies without an investment-grade credit rating or sufficient proved
reserves will need to provide supplemental financial assurance to comply
with the new rule.

Additionally, [the rule clarifies that current grant holders and lessees
must hold financial assurance to ensure compliance with lease
obligations and cannot rely on the financial strength of prior
owners.]{.underline} BOEM continues to maintain its ability to pursue
prior lessees to meet decommissioning obligations.

[[Under the new rule, BOEM]{.mark} estimates [industry will]{.mark} be
[require]{.mark}d to provide [**\$6.9 billion** in new]{.mark} financial
[assurances.]{.mark}]{.underline} To provide industry with flexibility
to meet the new financial assurance requirements, BOEM will allow
current lessees and grant holders to request phased-in payments over 3
years to meet the new supplemental financial assurance demands required
by the rule.

#### **BOEM is investing in new projects now.**

of America\",
https://www.boem.gov/newsroom/press-releases/boem-proposes-oil-and-gas-lease-sale-gulf-america\]
//wastella

WASHINGTON -- [[The B]{.mark}ureau of [O]{.mark}cean [E]{.mark}nergy
[M]{.mark}anagement today [announced the]{.mark} publication of a
[Proposed Notice of Sale]{.mark} (PNOS) [for an oil and gas lease sale
in the Gulf of America.]{.mark}]{.underline}

As directed by Secretary of the Interior and outlined in the PNOS, Lease
Sale 262 will offer approximately 15,000 unleased blocks located 3 to
231 miles offshore across the Gulf's Western, Central, and Eastern
Planning Areas. Covering roughly 80 million acres, these blocks are
situated in water depths ranging from 9 feet to more than 11,100 feet (3
to 3,400 meters).

[[This sale is the first of three planned lease sales in the Gulf of
America]{.mark} under the 2024--2029 Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas
Leasing Program. BOEM is also in the process of developing a new
National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program that will
include additional leasing opportunities.]{.underline}

\"Offshore oil and gas play a vital role in our nation\'s energy
portfolio, with the Gulf of America supplying 14% of domestically
produced oil,\" said BOEM's Principal Deputy Director Matt Giacona.
\"This proposed lease sale demonstrates BOEM's commitment to advancing
American Energy Dominance and fostering the production of affordable,
reliable energy resources for the nation."

The Gulf of America Outer Continental Shelf spans approximately 160
million acres and is estimated to contain around 48 billion barrels of
undiscovered, recoverable oil and 141 trillion cubic feet of natural
gas.

Leases awarded through Lease Sale 262 will be for oil and gas
exploration and development only. Certain areas may be excluded from
this lease sale, including blocks subject to the Sept. 8, 2020,
presidential withdrawal, blocks adjacent to or beyond the U.S. Exclusive
Economic Zone in the northern portion of the Eastern Gap, and blocks
within the current boundaries of the Flower Garden Banks National Marine
Sanctuary.

[\"To support robust industry participation, lower production costs, and
unleash the full potential of the Gulf of America's offshore energy
reserves, BOEM is proposing a royalty rate of 16 ⅔ percent for both
shallow and deepwater leases---the lowest rate for deepwater since
2007," said BOEM's Acting Regional Director for the GOA Laura
Robbins.]{.underline}

[Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas activities generate billions of
dollars from lease sales, rental fees and royalties. The funds are
distributed to the U.S. Treasury, as well as states through several
different revenue sharing programs that fund conservation and outdoor
recreation across the nation.]{.underline} The largest portion goes to
the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury, which benefits all U.S. citizens
through funding of daily operations of the federal government. Offshore
development fuels state and federal revenues, helping fund
infrastructure, education and public services.

Energy independence is a cornerstone of U.S. economic strength, national
security and global stability, boosting American energy dominance and
reducing reliance on unstable foreign producers. By continuing to expand
offshore capabilities, the United States ensures affordable energy for
consumers, strengthens domestic industry and reinforces its role as an
energy superpower.

https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2023/11/29/partnering_for_defense_arctic_domain_awareness_995461.html

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric **[Administration (NOAA) is an
intelligence collector at its core. From delivering]{.underline}**
lifesaving weather forecasts to ensuring uninterrupted commerce-critical
port operations, **[NOAA\'s scientists, instruments, and assets are
instrumental in information collection and dissemination. But unlike
what many in DoD think, NOAA is not just 'the weather people.' NOAA
brings scientists and operational experts in the air, land, space, and
sea - making their environmental intelligence critical for enhancing DoD
domain awareness,]{.underline}** information dominance, and decision
superiority. NOAA and DoD maintain research and data sharing
partnerships in areas of common interests. However, operational
collaborations once routine in the 20th century have all but stopped
until recently. [We have undertaken an effort to reestablish operational
coordination between NOAA and DoD, with some success. Still, recent
NOAA-DoD integration efforts toward national security end up facing
confusion, uncertainty, and institutional reticence due to ad hoc

NOAA\'s role as an intelligence collector and force multiplier for
national defense is often misunderstood -- or mischaracterized by DoD.
**[NOAA has extensive presence in the Arctic region, offering valuable
capabilities for data collection and information sharing leading to
enhanced domain awareness]{.underline}**. The DoD can benefit from
operationally partnering with NOAA as it once did to enhance national
capabilities, improve homeland defense, and mitigate national security
risks. [The DoD has a responsibility to incorporate NOAA into strategic
planning, operational activities, and policymaking as it seeks to gain a
comprehensive understanding of its operating environment.]{.underline}
By revitalizing the critical partnership with NOAA, we can leverage

[[The]{.mark} U.S. **[B]{.mark}**ureau of **[O]{.mark}**cean
**[E]{.mark}**nergy **[M]{.mark}**anagement (**BOEM**) [has unveiled
a]{.mark} **significant [spike]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the [oil]{.mark}
[and gas reserves in the **Gulf of America**]{.mark}]{.underline},
formerly the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, which is said to reinforce the
nation's offshore energy dominance aspirations.

[While confirming a "**major increase**" in the estimated **oil and gas
reserves** on the Gulf of America]{.underline} Outer Continental Shelf
(OCS), BOEM explains that [this serves to underscore the region's
[critical]{.mark} role [in advancing]{.mark} U.S. national security and
American [energy dominance]{.mark}]{.underline}, which President Donald
Trump is determined to unleash.

[The **B**ureau of **O**cean **E**nergy **M**anagement's analysis
spotlights an **additional 1.3 billion** barrels of oil]{.underline}
equivalent (boe) since 2021, [bringing the **total reserve estimate** to
7.04 billion boe, made up of 5.77 billion barrels of oil and 7.15
trillion cubic feet of natural gas, representing a 22.6% uptick
in]{.underline} remaining recoverable [reserves.]{.underline}

Doug Burgum, U.S. Secretary of the Interior, highlighted: "This new data
confirms what we've known all along---[America is sitting on a
**treasure trove** of energy]{.underline}, and under President Trump's
leadership, we're unlocking it. The Gulf of America is a powerhouse, and
[by streamlining **permitting** and **expanding** access,
we're]{.underline} not just powering our economy---[we're strengthening
our **national security**]{.underline} and putting thousands of
Americans back to work."

Authorities & Government

Furthermore, [**BOEM**'s updated review assessment went over **140 oil
and gas fields**, identifying 18 discoveries and analyzing **more than
37,000** reservoirs across 1,336 fields in the U.S. Gulf]{.underline},
which added 4.39 billion barrels of oil equivalent in original reserves.

[The **net increase**]{.underline}, after subtracting the production of
3.09 billion barrels of oil equivalent since 2020--2021, [is perceived
to reflect **continued opportunity** and momentum in offshore
development.]{.underline}

[The **B**ureau of **O**cean **E**nergy **M**anagement]{.underline},
which oversees nearly 3.2 billion acres of the Outer Continental Shelf,
with about 160 million acres in the Gulf, claims that the region
continues to be central to America's offshore energy future.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration reaffirmed its [commitment
to **expanding offshore energy**,]{.underline} followed by Secretary
Burgum directing BOEM to move forward with an oil and gas lease sale in
the Gulf.

Dr. James Kendall, BOEM Gulf of America Regional Director, underlined:
"The Gulf of America is delivering 14% of the nation's oil. These
updated estimates reaffirm [the Gulf's vital role in ensuring a
reliable, affordable domestic energy supply]{.underline}."

[BOEM]{.underline} sees the opening of the Outer Continental Shelf as a
**[core component]{.underline}** of the Trump administration's [strategy
to achieve **energy dominance**, with expanded leasing projected to
create tens of thousands of jobs across **exploration**, **production**,
**logistics**, and **supply chains**]{.underline}. This, in turn, is
expected to **[revitalize]{.underline}** coastal economies and fuel
America's [innovation]{.underline} zest.

BOEM emphasized: "[Energy dominance is a **pillar** of U.S. economic
strength and global **leadership.**]{.underline} By expanding offshore
capabilities, the United States ensures affordable energy for consumers,
creates high-paying jobs, and [**reduces dependence** on foreign
adversaries]{.underline}.

WASHINGTON --- [The **B**ureau of **O**cean **E**nergy **M**anagement is
planning to hold an oil and gas **lease sale** for blocks of seabed off
the U.S. Gulf Coast before the end of the year]{.underline}.

According to a proposed notice of sale published late last month, Lease
Sale 262 will conclude with a lease sale bid reading currently scheduled
for Dec. 10.

The reading will be livestreamed via Zoom, agency officials said.

According to the announcement, [roughly 15,000 unleased blocks, ranging
from three to 231 miles offshore, will be included in the
sale.]{.underline}

The blocks, which stretch across the Gulf's western, central and eastern
planning areas are located at water depths between nine feet and more
than 11,115 feet.

This sale is the first of three planned lease sales in the Gulf under
the 2024-2029 Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program.

Officials with the agency said it is also in the process of developing a
new National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program that
will include additional leasing opportunities.

"[Offshore oil and gas play a **vital role** in our nation's energy
portfolio, with the Gulf of America supplying 14% of **domestically
produced oil**]{.underline}," said BOEM's Principal Deputy Director Matt
Giacona.

"This proposed lease sale demonstrates [BOEM's commitment
to]{.underline} advancing American energy dominance and [fostering the
production of **affordable, reliable energy** resources for the
nation]{.underline}," he said.

It has been estimated that the Gulf's Outer Continental Shelf spans
[contains around 48 billion barrels of undiscovered, recoverable oil and
141 trillion cubic feet of natural gas]{.underline}.

Leases awarded through Lease Sale 262 will be for [**oil and gas**
exploration and development only]{.underline}.

[E[nergy production in the Gulf of America accounts for nearly 14
percent of total U.S. oil production and supports approximately 410,000
jobs. Alaska's oil and gas industry supports 69,200 jobs and \$5.9
billion in wages --- or 16 percent of all the jobs in the
state.]{.mark}]{.underline} Over the past 20 years, [offshore oil and

the Biden administration to unleash America\'s rich energy
resources]{.mark}.]{.underline}

On Jan. 20, 2025, [[President Trump signed Executive Order 14153 to
unleash Alaska's energy potential,]{.mark} which includes provisions
aimed at increasing offshore energy production.]{.underline}
Additionally, Department of the Interior Secretary [[Doug Burgum issued

offshore]{.mark} [withdrawal]{.mark} and encouraging exploration and
production on federal lands and waters.]{.underline} Last Congress,
House Republicans passed H.R. 1, which provided long-term certainty for
domestic offshore energy production. This Congress, Republicans on the
House Committee on Natural Resources will build upon the policies
advanced in H.R. 1 to enact lasting solutions promoting American
offshore energy production.

Today\'s hearing featured testimony from local experts and leaders in

This isn't just an industry challenge. It's a [**strategic imperative**.
Energy dominance gives the U.S. **leverage** over adversaries, stability
at home, and influence abroad.]{.underline} But that advantage isn't
permanent.

If U.S. oil and gas production plateaus and begins to decline---as Wood
Mackenzie forecasts may occur in the early 2030s---it will ripple across
markets. [U.S. influence abroad will **diminish**]{.underline}. Capital
for new exploration will dry up. [Buyers of U.S. energy may reevaluate
their long-term supply strategies. And a U.S. industry configured for
growth could struggle to compete in a world of declining output and
rising competition from **alternative energy sources**.]{.underline}

To preserve its energy advantage, [the U.S. must remain a **global
leader** in both hydrocarbons and the next generation of clean energy
technologies]{.underline}. Carbon capture, hydrogen, and advanced
nuclear must be seen not as threats to the oil and gas sector, but as
strategic hedges that preserve relevance in a decarbonizing world.
[Dominance is **not about** picking one path]{.underline}---it's about
keeping every option on the table and executing better than anyone else.

[America became an **energy superpower** by embracing risk, rewarding
innovation, and adapting faster]{.underline} than anyone else. That
mindset must continue. The shale boom won't last forever---but our
ability to lead the next energy era will depend on what we do now.

[The era of hydrocarbons **is accelerating** under the second Trump
administration]{.underline}, posing a direct threat to global climate
goals and putting years of clean energy progress at risk. On his first
day in office, US President Donald [Trump declared a national energy
emergency and signed an executive order establishing the **N**ational
**E**nergy **D**ominance **C**ouncil]{.underline}. Headed by Interior
Secretary Doug Burgum, its mandate revolves around fast-tracking oil,
gas and coal development.

This aggressive stance was reinforced by a series of executive orders
focused on reviving the coal industry, which Trump described as
"beautiful" and "clean". Surrounded by coal miners at the White House,
he pledged to accelerate leases for coal mining on federal land and
eliminate permitting delays that have long hindered coal expansion.

The administration has not limited its efforts to the federal level. It
has also taken aim at state-driven climate initiatives, seeking to
override local authority and weaken environmental protections. Moves to
block California's cap-and-trade policies, halt enforcement of penalties
against fossil fuel firms in New York and Vermont and shut down climate
lawsuits targeting oil companies all reflect a broader strategy to
consolidate fossil fuel influence across every level of government.

The recent approval of liquid natural gas exports from Commonwealth LNG
in Louisiana marks the first authorisation since president Joe Biden's
moratorium five years ago. These [initiatives **signal a shift** in US
strategy towards treating energy infrastructure]{.underline} not merely
as economic development but [as instruments of **geopolitical
influence**.]{.underline}

#### BOEM's strategy solves energy dominance.

**Kissane '24** \[Carolyn Kissane, 11-27-2024, \"Trump's Energy
Dominance Strategy Could Rewrite U.S. Foreign Policy\", Barrons,
https://www.barrons.com/articles/trump-wright-energy-dominance-strategy-foreign-policy-9d734811\]//LASA-AR

Trump's second term could offer an energy-forward foreign policy,
leaning into other countries' need for access to energy. [By leveraging
America's **energy abundance**, the U.S. could take on a **proactive
role** in supporting allies and developing partnerships centered on
**energy security.**]{.underline} This approach to "energy statecraft"
could turn U.S. energy resources into a pivotal element of foreign
policy, advancing strategic interests and promoting stability in regions
critical to U.S. geopolitical goals.

Energy dominance 2.0 will redefine U.S. energy from a domestic asset
into a geopolitical tool. By embracing a hydrocarbon-forward yet
diversified strategy, the U.S. can lead by deploying its strengths with
precision and purpose. Under Wright, [U.S. **hydrocarbons** will likely
serve as a **carrot and a stick**.]{.underline} Sanctions enforcement
could intensify, particularly [against adversaries such as Iran, cutting
off their energy revenues while **stabilizing** global markets through
increased U.S. output.]{.underline}

Trump's second term [could accelerate **l**iquefied **n**atural **g**as
exports to Europe and Asia, helping allies **reduce dependence** on
Russia and other adversarial suppliers]{.underline}. Russia is Europe's
third-largest source of gas imports, a shocking fact in light of the
billions of dollars Europe is sending to Ukraine to fight Russian
aggression. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has
pointed to the potential of U.S. LNG to replace Russian imports---a
strategic opportunity for the U.S. to strengthen ties with Europe and
provide a secure energy supply at a competitive cost. [The U.S. could
deploy **energy technology** and infrastructure investments in Africa
and Southeast Asia to counter China's Belt and Road
Initiative]{.underline}, offering nations an alternative partnership
that aligns with U.S. strategic interests.

[Critical mineral development]{.underline} will feature prominently in
this strategy. China dominates producing and processing minerals
essential for renewable energy and battery storage. Wright is expected
to push for streamlined regulations to open new mines and establish
U.S.-controlled supply chains to reduce the nation's reliance on Chinese
imports.

China dominates what it has called the "new three": solar, lithium
battery production, and electric-vehicle manufacturing. [The
U.S.]{.underline} is behind in all three. Instead, its [**edge** lies in
its **hydrocarbon resources**, nuclear technology, and a host of
innovative clean and carbon technologies]{.underline}. For instance,
exporting advanced U.S. oil and gas technologies could help emerging
producers in Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia develop their
resources efficiently and with higher environmental standards. Such
[partnerships]{.underline} not only foster goodwill but also position
the U.S. as [a leader in responsible **energy
development**,]{.underline} providing a stark alternative to China's
often opaque and exploitative practices

jxu

In its April 2025 report titled [Offshore Wind Energy: Actions Needed to
Address Gaps in Interior's Oversight of Development]{.underline}
(GAO-25-106998), the [U.S. Government Accountability Office
([GAO]{.mark}) examines the expanding footprint of offshore wind energy
in federal waters and the Department of the Interior's readiness to
manage its impacts]{.underline}. Authored by Frank Rusco and developed
with input from 23 experts convened by the National Academies, the
[[report reveals **significant gaps**]{.mark} **in
oversight**]{.underline}, particularly **[[regarding tribal engagement,
stakeholder inclusion, and]{.mark} regional [resource
planning]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

GAO's findings underscore the dual nature of offshore wind energy\'s
promise and peril. On one hand, the deployment of offshore wind
infrastructure is poised to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide
cleaner air, improved public health outcomes, and economic investment in
coastal communities. On the other, the long-term effects on marine life,
fishing industries, tribal cultural resources, radar systems, and
maritime safety remain uncertain, especially as scientific data lags
behind development timelines.

The [Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (**BOEM**)]{.underline} and the
Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) lead federal
oversight of offshore wind through a complex permitting process that
involves coordination with state and federal agencies, tribal
governments, and industry stakeholders. Despite this, the [**GAO found
[persistent issues in BOEM's consultation]{.mark}** practices **[with
Tribes]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While BOEM has initiated efforts to
improve tribal engagement, including a December 2024 tribal engagement
strategy, [[it has **not established a clear** implementation **plan or
reporting** mechanism]{.underline}]{.mark}. Nearly all tribal
representatives interviewed expressed concerns about limited capacity to
review technical documentation or engage meaningfully in consultations.
BOEM's current statutory authority limits its ability to support tribal
capacity building, leading GAO to recommend a congressional amendment to
enable more effective tribal involvement.

Concerns also persist among commercial fisheries stakeholders. Though
[**[BOEM]{.mark}** has [engaged with **fishing
representatives**]{.mark}]{.underline} during early stages of project
planning, GAO found that responses to stakeholder input [**were often**
unclear or **[inadequate]{.mark}**. The **[lack of a transparent
process]{.mark}**]{.underline} for integrating fisheries' feedback into
lease area decisions [risks **[alienat]{.mark}ing** [critical
constituencies and **jeopardiz**]{.mark}**ing** [sustainable **resource
management**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Similarly, GAO noted a [lack of
guidance and monitoring protocols for developer-mandated community
engagement plans]{.underline}, leaving oversight duties unfulfilled.

Another [critical finding is the [**absence** of]{.mark} a
**BOEM**]{.underline} or BSEE [[**physical presence** in the **North
Atlantic**]{.mark} **region**, [where]{.mark} much of the [**U.S.
offshore wind construction** is underway]{.mark}]{.underline}. While the
agencies have committed to building capacity, [they have yet to
establish regional offices]{.underline} as they have in the Pacific and

of the agreement covers all renewable energy activities in the Atlantic,
the initial focus will be on the USACE supporting the review of the
Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Commercial project and the Kitty Hawk
project" off North Carolina, according to a BOEM statement.

The new partnership is the latest development out of a Biden executive
order directing closer interagency consultation between the Department
of the Interior and Department of Defense to "increase renewable energy
production on public lands and in offshore waters, while ensuring robust
protection for our lands, waters, and biodiversity and creating
good-paying jobs," the agency says.

Since March, BOEM and Interior have been keeping up a drumbeat of new
developments, from promising up to 10 environmental reviews this year
for East Coast wind projects, to speeding up plans for floating wind
turbines off California and soliciting interest from wind developers in
Gulf of Mexico sites.

**[[Agency officials acknowledge]{.mark} the [push is demanding a
lot]{.mark} from its workforce]{.underline}**.

"Yes, this is a **[[real challenge for us]{.underline}]{.mark}**," said
James Bennett, chief of BOEM's renewable energy program, in response to
questions during one virtual public meeting in May. "We have a team
examining that."

[[Along with **reassigning staff** from elsewhere]{.mark} in **BOEM**

### Deep Sea Mining Fails\-\--2AC

#### **Deep sea mining [can't]{.underline} solve energy dominance\-\--it doesn't account for the economy.**

**Vescovo '25** \[Victor Vescovo, 5-22-2025, \"The Economics of Deep-Sea
Mining Don\'t Add Up\",
https://time.com/7287891/deep-sea-mining-economics-dont-add-up/,
accessed 7-22-2025\] //wastella

Deep-seafloor mining is a complex topic that leaves out a crucial
starting point: mining the potato-sized rocks on the seafloor called
"nodules" only yields four metals of any economic consequence: nickel,
cobalt, copper, and manganese. Since copper and manganese are plentiful
on land, deep-seafloor mining is really all about nickel and cobalt.
And, [unlike many have tried to claim, [you cannot]{.mark} in fact
[get]{.mark} [meaningful amounts of rare earth elements from the
seafloor]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In the early 2020s, deep-seafloor mining was advertised as a source of
key metals for electric vehicle (EV) batteries. However, battery
technology has moved dramatically forward with new chemistries that
require no cobalt or nickel and instead use inexpensive iron,
phosphorus, and sodium. Cobalt and nickel prices have collapsed since
2022 and both are now in oversupply worldwide. In other words, cobalt-
and nickel-based batteries are yesterday's technology.

With the EV battery narrative collapsing, Canadian deep-sea mining firm
and global leader in the field, The Metals Company (TMC), recently
shifted its marketing away from batteries to instead advertise that
seafloor mining is a way for the United States to obtain "critical
metals." [China currently dominates worldwide supply of many critical
metals but this is because it leads in the processing of metals, not the
mining of the raw ore. China mines less than 5% of world nickel or
cobalt ore, yet they control approximately 75% of nickel and cobalt
processing and sales worldwide.]{.underline}

[If the United States wanted to secure its own metal supply chains, [it
would be better to focus on]{.mark} simplified [permitting to
process]{.mark} critical [metals domestically or with our
allies]{.mark}, rather than strip-mining the depths for
nodules.]{.underline} This is what China does: it imports ore from
Indonesia and the Congo to secure its nickel and cobalt dominance. [We
could do the same with our own allies much more easily and inexpensively
than mining the seafloor.]{.underline} TMC claims that once it reaches
full production levels in eight to 10 years it could produce 119,000
tons of nickel and 9,000 tons of cobalt per year. Even if the company
could accomplish that, it would constitute just over 3% of projected
2025 world production for each. That's correct: almost 97% of nickel and
cobalt supply would still come from terrestrial sources.

[[The cost assumptions for deep-seafloor mining don't]{.mark} appear to
[account for inflation and changes in]{.mark} [interest rates]{.mark}.
In 2021, TMC's public filings projected its total costs through 2046 at
nearly \$38 billion. Five years later after the highest inflation since
the 1980s and a more than doubling of offshore drill ship rates? No
public change to their forecast. Any apparent change in their total
financing costs given the recent doubling of interest rates?
None.]{.underline}

The report, We don't need deep-sea mining, released by Environment
America Research & Policy Center, U.S. PIRG Education Fund and Frontier
Group just weeks ahead of a key international summit on the topic,
outlines how mining operations could destroy vulnerable ecosystems. It
also details how taking common sense steps such as reducing the
electronic waste we generate can help meet our mineral demands.

The report cites research indicating that deep-sea mining is not needed
to meet the critical mineral needs of the energy transition. The authors
outline how [[we can build a circular economy for critical minerals
around the 5 Rs]{.mark} -- the traditional 3 Rs of reduce, reuse and
recycle, coupled with reimagining products for greater efficiency and
durability and repairing products to extend their
lifetimes]{.underline}. [[Strategies such as these could]{.mark},
according to research cited in the report, [fully close global supply
gaps for nickel and copper by 2030 and dramatically narrow gaps
for]{.mark} cobalt, lithium and the [rare earth element]{.mark}
neodymium.]{.underline}

"Electronic waste is the fastest growing waste stream in the world, and
many devices are made to be disposable. Why dive three miles below the
surface, wreak havoc on a remote ecosystem, all to mine these materials
and then put them in throwaway devices such as unfixable cell phones or
disposable vapes?" explained Nathan Proctor, senior director of the
Right to Repair campaigns at U.S. PIRG Education Fund. ["The solution is
obvious. Make long-lasting products, fix them when they break and
recycle them when you can't."]{.underline}

This report comes as diplomats from around the world prepare to travel
to Jamaica in July, where the International Seabed Authority could
debate, for the first time, a proposal to put a moratorium on mining --
or see a loophole pave the way for the first commercial exploitation of
the deep sea for minerals ever undertaken.

#### Offshore mining won't change energy dominance -- existing leases, EV's, and Trump

[President-elect Donald Trump will have trouble meeting his pledges to
massively increase oil production --- even if he manages to overturn
President Joe Biden's sweeping new ban on offshore
drilling.]{.underline}

[[Reluctance by]{.mark} economically skittish petroleum
[producers]{.mark}, the rise in [fuel-efficient cars and]{.mark} Trump's
own threatened [trade wars]{.mark} will [make]{.mark} it
[difficult]{.mark} for the United States [to produce]{.mark}
significantly [more oil]{.mark} than it already does]{.underline},
energy analysts told POLITICO on Monday. [The fact that the U.S. is
already the world's biggest oil producer and biggest gas exporter will
also make sharp increases hard to achieve, [despite]{.mark} Trump's
campaign [pledges of energy "dominance."]{.mark}]{.underline}

At the same time, Biden's new prohibition on oil and gas lease sales in
625 million acres of federal waters is likely destined to be a symbolic
action --- mostly affecting territory where political pressures or other
obstacles have already kept the coastline free from oil rigs.

Trump, who campaigned on cutting U.S. energy prices in half in his first
18 months and ramping up oil output, nonetheless said Monday that he
would immediately undo Biden's action after taking office Jan. 20.

"It's ridiculous. I'll unban it immediately," Trump said in an interview
with radio host Hugh Hewitt, hours after the announcement by Biden's
Interior Department. "It'll be changed on Day One."

In fact, [Trump would face legal obstacles in trying to reverse Biden's
action, and may need Congress to overturn the new
prohibition]{.underline}, according to energy experts. And these are the
even more daunting obstacles facing his broader pledges for a sharp
increase in drilling:

[The [economics]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Trump may be able to lead the oil industry to public lands, but he
can't make it drill]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In addition to undoing Biden's ban on new drilling projects in federal
deep waters, Trump has also pledged to expand the amount of federal land
open to drilling rigs, including opening up the long-fought-over Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. And he wants to pare back the
royalties the Interior Department charges companies to produce oil on
public land and fees that the Biden administration increased.

That's all welcome news as far as oil industry lobbyists are concerned,
but it won't necessarily lead to more oil output, analysts said.

[[Companies]{.mark} spent years assuring investors that they [can
produce only as much oil as the market needs]{.mark} without building up
debt]{.underline} as they did before the Covid pandemic, so executives
at U.S. oil companies and the oil-producing countries in OPEC and its
allies are not going to open the spigot unless they see strong demand
for it, said Bob Ryan, head of analysis firm Ryan Commodity Insights.

"Oil producers in the U.S. --- and in OPEC+ --- have finally convinced
investors they are not going to increase output if it erodes their
profitability or fiscal positions," Ryan said in an email. "[Trump can
make the regulatory environment more accommodative to oil producers, but
the market will let them know when higher output is
needed]{.underline}."

Oil market analysts at the financial services company Macquarie agreed:
"Our 2025 \[forecasts\] don't have large U.S. supply growth or OPEC+
returning, and Trump 2.0 is neutral," they said in a recent market note.

[[Oil prices]{.underline}]{.mark} have climbed since Thanksgiving but
remain lower than they were a year ago --- [and [too low to
attract]{.mark} the huge [new investments in drilling]{.mark} that Trump
is seeking. Forty-two percent of U.S. oil executives responding to a
Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas survey last week said their spending on
new projects in 2025 would be the same or lower compared with last
year]{.underline}, while another 43 percent said it would "increase
slightly."

deep waters, Trump has also pledged to expand the amount of federal land

The culprit? [The [uncertain]{.mark} picture for oil consumption,
largely from China, the world's new energy hog and the country that has
led global [oil demand]{.mark} growth in recent years.]{.underline}

Industry executives have said [[access to domestic oil fields hasn't
been a problem]{.mark}. Most oil and gas production in the United States
occurs on private land -- most recently in New Mexico and west
Texas.]{.underline} Environmental groups have also pointed to the
[[thousands of leases]{.mark} that [companies already hold to drill on
federal land]{.mark} that they are not using as proof there is
[no]{.mark} burning [need for more]{.mark} public [land]{.mark} to
drill]{.underline}.

In the end, U.S. oil production could continue the growth it's seen for
most of the past two decades --- but it will have more to do with
markets than any of Trump's policies, said Tamas Varga, oil market
analyst at PVM Oil Associates.

"The growth in oil production will be determined by market forces,
shareholder pressure, \[capital expenditures\] and oil prices," Varga
said in an email. "Therefore [the increase will not be measured in
millions of barrels per day but a few 100,000 barrels per day, if
that]{.underline}."

[Cleaner vehicles take a bite]{.underline}

[[Global]{.mark} gasoline [demand]{.mark} is [expected to peak]{.mark}
this year [amid]{.mark} growing adoption of [e]{.mark}lectric
[v]{.mark}ehicles and efficiency improvements in gasoline-powered cars
and trucks]{.underline}, according to the commodities analysis firm S&P
Global. That could keep a lid on the profits oil companies generate from
fossil fuel sales.

While Republicans are eyeing cuts to Biden's electric vehicles
incentives in the United States, [demand for zero-emissions
transportation is booming in China]{.underline}, whose massive market is
driving the priorities of the major automakers. That alone figures to
weigh on oil demand --- especially as China seeks to establish market
dominance in the international EV sector.

EV sales are expected to skyrocket in China, hitting a 66 percent market
share by 2034 and achieving 89 percent of total sales when combined with
hybrid vehicles, according to the consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. That
amounts to [8 percent annual growth through 2030 compared with an 11
percent yearly drop for internal combustion engine models.]{.underline}

"Wherever you are, Chinese EVs are coming your way," Malcolm
Forbes-Cable, vice president of upstream and carbon management
consulting at Wood Mackenzie, wrote in a recent memo.

That growth is part of the reason the International Energy Agency
forecast a leveling off of global oil demand by 2030. It projected
renewables, electric vehicles and advances in fuel economy would rein in
consumption, pushing global demand to 106 million barrels per day by the
end of the decade from 102 million in 2023 --- but plateauing after
that.

[[Energy permitting]{.mark} is [still a mess]{.mark}]{.underline}

One thing the oil industry and supporters of clean energy agree on is
that the federal permitting process needs overhauling. [The
[long]{.mark} [approval times and legal obstacles]{.mark} that
[slow]{.mark} the [construction of]{.mark} everything from new
[pipelines to electric transmission]{.mark} lines mean that projects
that could deliver more energy to markets [take years to get
built]{.mark} --- if they succeed at all]{.underline}.

Lawmakers from both parties agree on the need to update permitting
rules, so you might think Congress would have fixed the problem in a
bipartisan fashion by now. But that's not the case: Republicans and
Democrats failed to strike a compromise agreement in the waning weeks of
the Biden administration, worried they were giving the other party too
much of what they wanted and receiving too little in return. In the end,
the whole process went bust before the holidays.

In two weeks, the GOP will have unified control of government, but the
party will keep its focus on a budget bill using a reconciliation
process that isn't suited for major changes to permitting.

Donald Trump speaks.

Trump is also expected to expand tariffs on imported steel, another
major cost for oil companies. \| Evan Vucci/AP

[Trump's looming [trade war]{.mark}]{.underline}

[During Trump's first term in the White House, trade policy was often a
thorn in the side of its energy policy --- and for oil
producers]{.underline}. Trump's recent threat of tariffs show there
could be a replay of that.

Trump has promised a [[25 percent tariff]{.mark} on all products from
Canada and Mexico]{.underline} if they fail to stem the flow of migrants
or illegal drugs. That [penalty would [raise the price on]{.mark} the
more than 3 million barrels of heavy crude [oil]{.mark} a day the two
countries send into the United States -- a potentially inflationary
measure that could [erode domestic fuel demand]{.mark}]{.underline},
because U.S. refineries can't easily replace those barrels of heavy
crude with the "light" oil produced domestically.

Tariffs would imperil deliveries of heavy crude from Canada, the top
U.S. supplier of the stuff, that would be "exceedingly difficult to
replace," energy consulting firm ClearView Energy Partners wrote in a
December note. That would throttle gasoline production by taking key
supplies offline, as those heavy crude shipments to complex refineries
hover near 3 million barrels per day --- accounting for roughly 18
percent of crude inputs for U.S. refineries.

"We understand President Trump's agenda with respect to tariffs, but we
feel strongly that he should consider walling off energy," said Tom
Pyle, president of the conservative think tank Institute for Energy
Research, who noted the challenges refiners would face replacing
Canadian imports. "I think it's perfectly appropriate to include Canada
as a reliable trading partner."

[Trump is also expected to expand [tariffs on]{.mark} imported
[steel]{.mark}, another major cost for oil companies. The last time
Trump raised tariffs on imported steel, it helped [knock plans
for]{.mark} a [gas]{.mark} export [project]{.mark} in Alaska off the
table.]{.underline}

[Trump's [mass deportation]{.mark} plans could also [remove workers from
a labor pool that]{.mark} the oil industry has already complained [is
too shallow]{.mark} for its liking. All in all, Trump's [trade and
immigration policies]{.mark} could raise prices for companies, which
would then pass them along to consumers and [weigh on fuel
demand]{.mark}.]{.underline}

NEW YORK, April 30 (Reuters) - Just 100 days into President Donald
Trump\'s second term, [[oil prices]{.mark} have **[slumped]{.mark} over
[20%]{.mark}** to [below]{.mark} many U.S. producers\' [**breakeven
costs** as investors lose confidence amid tariff]{.mark} and **policy
[uncertainty]{.mark}** - [undercutting]{.mark} Trump\'s push for U.S.
**[energy dominance]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Trump campaigned on the often repeated refrain of \"drill, baby, drill\"
and moved on his first day in office on January 20 to maximize output in
the U.S., the world\'s top oil and gas producer.

[His [protectionist]{.mark} trade [policy]{.mark}, however, has
**[reduced oil demand]{.mark}** growth forecasts, and lower
international energy prices have soured the outlook for the
industry.]{.underline}

[Benchmark U.S. crude [prices]{.mark} have [plummeted to]{.mark} around
[\$60]{.mark} a barrel, a low [not seen since]{.mark} the
[COVID]{.mark}-19 pandemic, [and below]{.mark} the [\$65 level that
many]{.mark} oil [producers]{.mark} say they [need to make
money]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Over half of the decline occurred since Trump\'s \"Liberation Day\" on
April 2 when he declared a minimum 10% tariff on U.S. imports, prompting
expectations that the global economy would slow.

A graphic shows a chart of U.S. crude futures prices since 2020.

\"The macro environment has gotten much worse, thanks to the tariffs and
policy uncertainty,\" said Ben Cahill, director at the Center for Energy
and Environmental Systems Analysis at the University of Texas at Austin.

\"**[[Energy dominance requires investor
confidence]{.underline}]{.mark}**,\" he added.

The Trump administration has also imposed sanctions targeting Iranian
oil sales, including on China-based energy facilities, in an attempt to
help prevent Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon and funding
militant groups across the Middle East. While the sanctions provided
some support to oil prices, they added to market uncertainty.

Citing U.S. tariffs, [[forecasters]{.mark} across the board, including
the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the International Energy
Agency, OPEC and major banks, have [cut]{.mark} their oil [price and
demand]{.mark} growth [outlooks]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[OPEC+\'s decision to speed up output hikes this spring exacerbated the
price fall]{.underline}. Yet, Trump had called on Saudi Arabia and OPEC
to bring down the cost of oil just days after he took office.

As a result of the price slump, U.S. crude producers - who were pumping
some 13.4 million barrels per day (bpd) in April and are expected to
pump 13.5 million bpd in 2025, down from previous forecasts - are
already putting the brakes on drilling new wells.

\"[[Trump]{.mark} and his energy team seem to [think]{.mark} U.S.
[producers]{.mark} will [drill through]{.mark} the [uncertainty]{.mark}
that\'s been created. [They won\'t]{.mark}, and hoping they will is a
**poor calculus**]{.underline},\" Roe Patterson, former CEO of oilfield

surface, wreak havoc on a remote ecosystem, all to mine these materials
and then put them in throwaway devices such as unfixable cell phones or
disposable vapes?" explained Nathan Proctor, senior director of the
Right to Repair campaigns at U.S. PIRG Education Fund. ["The solution is
obvious. Make long-lasting products, fix them when they break and
recycle them when you can't."]{.underline}

This report comes as diplomats from around the world prepare to travel
to Jamaica in July, where the International Seabed Authority could
debate, for the first time, a proposal to put a moratorium on mining --
or see a loophole pave the way for the first commercial exploitation of
the deep sea for minerals ever undertaken.

### AT: Oil Wars\-\--2AC

#### Oil Wars are a myth.

School, 5/15/20, Cornell University Press, 2021., *The Oil Wars
Myth*//WF

Despite oil's extraordinary economic and military value, [[countries
have]{.mark} **largely [refrained]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} international
[petroleum grabs]{.mark}. They have **[avoided]{.mark}** classic **[oil
wars]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Only one state has launched an oil gambit.
A few countries have initiated oil campaigns, in the midst of ongoing
international wars that were started for other reasons. [States have
perpetrated fewer than twenty oil spats.]{.underline} These [[numbers
are]{.mark} **remarkably [small]{.mark}**]{.underline}, particularly in
comparison to the number of countries that could have fought to obtain
petroleum resources over the course of almost a century. Moreover,
countries initiated their oil spats selectively, reserving them for
situations in which obstacles were limited or additional gains were
large. In the severe conflicts---the oil campaigns and oil
gambit---[[leaders exhausted all other means]{.mark} of satisfying
national petroleum needs [before turning]{.mark} to international
[aggression]{.mark}.]{.underline} And in all the conflicts,
[[petroleum]{.mark} ambitions were **[never]{.mark}** decision makers'
**[sole motive]{.mark}** for aggression. [States are]{.mark} evidently
**extremely [reluctant]{.mark}** [to fight for oil]{.mark}
resources.]{.underline}

My [[findings **controvert** the oil wars **myth**, as well as]{.mark}
popular [interpretations]{.mark} of many [of]{.mark} the twentieth
century's deadliest [international]{.mark}
[conflicts]{.mark}.]{.underline} [They also challenge]{.underline}
international relations scholars' assumptions that fighting for oil pays
[[and that the resource is a]{.mark} significant [**cause** of
interstate conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline} In addition, these results
raise a number of further questions. First, will countries fight to
control petroleum resources in the future if oil prices rise or fall?
Second, why is oil different from other natural resources that were the
objects of imperialist projects? Third, how does the divergence between
the oil wars myth and the historical record matter? Fourth, does states'
reluctance to prosecute classic oil wars, oil gambits, oil campaigns,
and oil spats affect their willingness to engage in other forms of
oil-related contention? And fifth, what does this mean for US foreign
policy? This conclusion will begin to answer these questions, while
encouraging other researchers to pursue them further.

#### TONS of barriers preventing oil wars\-\--empirics prove

Emily **Meierding 16**, Emily Meierding is an assistant professor of
national security affairs at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey,
California, 5/19/16, Good Authority, "Oil wars: Why nations aren't
battling over resources,"
https://goodauthority.org/news/oil-wars-why-nations-arent-battling-over-resources/,
igogi

[[Countries face]{.underline}]{.mark} at least four sets of [[obstacles
that discourage]{.underline}]{.mark} them from [[fighting for
oil]{.underline}]{.mark}: invasion costs, occupation costs,
international costs and investment costs. [[**Invasion costs**
are]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[damage that wars inflict on oil
fields]{.underline}]{.mark} and infrastructure. [[**Occupation costs**
arise from local resistance]{.underline}]{.mark} to foreign occupation,
which can target oil industry infrastructure and personnel.
[**[International costs]{.mark}** are]{.underline} imposed by the
international community, which can respond to oil grabs with [[economic
**sanctions** and military interventions]{.mark}. [**Investment costs**
are the challenges of]{.mark} [attracting foreign
capital]{.mark}]{.underline} and technical expertise [[to occupied oil
fields]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Collectively, [these]{.underline} four sets of [costs dramatically
reduce the payoffs of fighting for oil]{.underline} and the appeal of
oil wars. When the many [[other costs of]{.mark} war]{.underline},
[including **[manpower and materiel]{.mark}**,]{.underline} are taken
into account, [[fighting for oil]{.mark} [becomes]{.mark} even **[less
attractive]{.mark}**]{.underline}. From a purely rational standpoint,
countries shouldn't launch oil wars.

But, countries don't always act rationally. To test the oil war
hypothesis, we have to take another look at historical so-called oil
wars.

Closer examination shows that [[oil has not been
the]{.underline}]{.mark} fundamental [[cause of any international
wars]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [[Falklands War]{.underline}]{.mark} in
1982 [was triggered by national pride]{.underline} and Argentine
officials' fear that their window of opportunity for retaking the
islands was closing. Rather than fight over oil, [Britain and
Argentina]{.underline} [tried to use it as a catalyst for
cooperation]{.underline}. In the 1970s and 1990s, they tried to jointly
develop the Falklands' oil resources.

The [[Iran-Iraq War]{.underline}]{.mark}, from 1980 to 1988,
[was]{.underline} also **[not an oil war]{.underline}**. Iraq initially
aimed only to gain control over the Shatt al-Arab waterway and 130
square miles of contested territory. In the early stages of the war,
Iraq repeatedly offered to withdraw from Iran, if Tehran would accept
those demands. However, [Iranian]{.underline} officials [accused the
Iraqis of fighting for oil]{.underline} in order [to discredit
them]{.underline} internationally.

[[The Chaco War]{.underline}]{.mark}, from 1932 to 1935,
[[was]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[launched]{.underline}]{.mark} for
other reasons. Bolivia and Paraguay knew that oil discoveries in the
Chaco region were unlikely. They fought [[because of national
pride]{.underline}]{.mark} and to avoid further territorial
dismemberment, after major losses in the 19th century. The oil
explanation didn't appear until the war bogged down, when leaders tried
to transfer responsibility for the devastating conflict onto
international oil companies.

### AT: Energy Wars\-\--2AC

#### Energy insecurity does not lead to war

Emily **Meierding 20**, Emily Meierding is an assistant professor of
national security affairs at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey,
California, 8/2/20, Lawfare, "The Exaggerated Threat of Oil Wars,"
https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/exaggerated-threat-oil-wars, igogi

[Between 1912 and 2010]{.underline}, [[countries fought 180 times over
territories that contained]{.underline}]{.mark}---or were believed to
contain---[[oil]{.underline}]{.mark} or natural gas resources. These
conflicts ranged from brief, nonfatal border violations, like Turkish
jets entering Greek airspace, to the two world wars. Many of these
clashes---including World War II, Iraq's invasion of Kuwait (1990), the
U.S. invasion of Iraq (2003), the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), the
Falklands War (1982), and the Chaco War between Bolivia and Paraguay
(1932-1935)---have been described as classic oil wars: that is, severe
international conflicts in which countries fight to obtain petroleum
resources.

However, [a closer look]{.underline} at these conflicts
[reveals]{.underline} [that [none merits the classic "oil
war"]{.underline}]{.mark} label. Although countries did fight over
oil-endowed territories, [[they]{.underline}]{.mark} usually [[fought
for **other reasons**]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[including]{.underline}]{.mark} aspirations to regional
[[heg]{.underline}]{.mark}emony, [[domestic]{.mark}
[politics]{.mark}]{.underline}, national pride,
[[or]{.underline}]{.mark} contested territories' other strategic,
[[econ]{.mark}omic]{.underline}, or symbolic
[[assets]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Oil]{.underline}]{.mark} was an
uncommon trigger for international confrontations and [[never caused
major conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[On]{.underline} approximately [20 occasions]{.underline}, over almost a
century, [countries engaged in minor conflicts to obtain
oil]{.underline} resources. However, [these "[oil spats" were **brief,
mild, mostly nonfatal**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and generally involved
countries whose hostility predated their resource competition. Greece
and Turkey have prosecuted oil spats. So have China and Vietnam, Guyana
and Venezuela, and a dozen other pairs of countries. These
confrontations inspired aggressive rhetoric while they were underway,
but none of them ever escalated into a larger armed conflict.

Oil has periodically influenced the trajectories of major conflicts that
were launched for other reasons. At the end of World War I, British
troops seized Mosul province in order to secure its oil resources. Oil
aspirations also motivated Germany's invasion of the Russian Caucasus
(1941-1942) and Japan's invasion of the Dutch East Indies (1941-1942).
While the latter attack precipitated U.S. involvement in World War II,
it was also a continuation of the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945).
All of these "oil campaigns" were inspired by aggressors' wartime
resource needs. Absent the ongoing conflicts, these countries would not
have fought for oil.

The historical record also reveals one "oil gambit": Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait in 1990. Conventional explanations for the attack assert that
Saddam Hussein was either greedily attempting to grab his neighbor's oil
resources or needily attempting to limit Kuwait's oil output in order to
raise oil prices and escape from a deepening economic crisis caused by
falling oil prices and Iraq's large debts, incurred during the Iran-Iraq
War. The first explanation is wrong. The second is correct, but
incomplete, because it omits Saddam's larger motive for aggression: his
fear of the United States. The regime's records, seized during the 2003
U.S. invasion, reveal Saddam's belief, nurtured since the 1970s, that
the United States was determined to contain Iraq and remove him from
power. In 1990, this false conviction led Saddam to assume that the
United States was engineering Iraq's economic crisis by encouraging
Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates to exceed their OPEC oil production
quotas and refuse Iraq's repeated entreaties to cancel its war debts.
After his infamous meeting with U.S. Ambassador April Glaspie failed to
persuade Saddam of the United States's benign intentions, he concluded
that conquering Kuwait was his only remaining means of survival. Fear of
U.S. hostility, not oil aspirations, prompted Iraq to invade Kuwait.

A Question of Value

The absence of oil wars is surprising and counterintuitive. Petroleum is
an exceptionally valuable resource. It fuels all countries' economies
and militaries. Oil sales are also a crucial revenue source for producer
states. Surely, countries are willing to fight to obtain petroleum
resources.

In fact, [[classic oil wars are]{.mark} **extraordinarily
[costly]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A country that aims to seize foreign oil
faces, [first, the costs of invading]{.underline} another country.
International aggression is destructive and expensive under the best of
circumstances. [It may also damage the oil infra]{.underline}structure
that a conqueror hopes to acquire. Next, if a conqueror plans to exploit
oil resources over the long term, it faces the [costs of occupying
seized territory]{.underline}. As the [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [has learned from its "endless wars,"]{.underline}
foreign occupation is extremely challenging, even for the world's most
powerful country.

[Additionally, [a conqueror faces **international
approbation**]{.mark}]{.underline} for oil grabs.
As censorious responses to Trump's proposition that the United States
"take the oil" from Syria, Iraq and Libya have indicated, seizing
another country's oil is considered reprobate behavior. [It violates
i]{.underline}nternational [law]{.underline}s against plunder and
materially threatens to consolidate control over global oil resources.
As Iraq learned in 1990, [[other countries]{.underline}]{.mark} and
international institutions [[respond]{.mark}]{.underline} to oil grabs
[[with]{.underline}]{.mark} diplomatic [[censure]{.underline}]{.mark},
economic [[sanctions and]{.underline}]{.mark} even military
[[force]{.underline}]{.mark}. Finally, if a conqueror manages to
maintain control over foreign oil resources, it may not be able to
exploit them. Conquest scares off the foreign oil companies that many
countries rely on to finance and manage oil production.

Because of the high costs of invasion, occupation, and international
opprobrium, [classic oil wars are]{.underline} simply [not worth the
effort]{.underline}, [regardless of petroleum's value]{.underline}.
Countries may occasionally decide that it is worth initiating an oil
spat to obtain desired resources, especially when targeted territories
are contested and other issues are at stake. However, fighting major
conflicts for oil does not pay.

### Energy Security Turn\-\--2AC

#### Energy dependence reduces risk of conflict through trade

Osman **Gökçe et. al. 21**, an Assistant Professor in the Faculty of
Humanities and Social Sciences at Istanbul Medipol University and
previously a research assistant in the Department of International
Studies at Sabancı University with a Ph.D. degree from Sabancı
University, 8/21, ScienceDirect, "The pacifying effect of energy
dependence on interstate conflict: A Large-N analysis," Volume 81,
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2021.102133, igogi + wjiang

[[Energy remains]{.underline}]{.mark} to be [[the most]{.mark}
**important [trade]{.mark}**[d commodity]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
world. Economic progress, social development and national security of a
state necessitate dependable and affordable energy. As a result,
[securing]{.underline} affordable and [sustained]{.underline} flow of
[energy]{.underline} resources [has been]{.underline} a [major foreign
policy]{.underline} [objective]{.underline} of modern societies. Despite
the salience of energy for an item in a state's foreign policy, few
studies have systematically analyzed how [[energy flows affect
interstate relations]{.underline}]{.mark} in a large-N setting. Using
the recently released Global Energy Relations Dataset that covers the
globe between 1978 and 2014, we conduct one of the first such systematic
analysis and look at whether an importer's level of energy dependency to
an exporter affects its behavior towards this supplier. In doing so, we
also dissect interstate energy flows into various components namely
coal, oil, gas and electricity, and assess the individual effect each
resource has on dyadic relations of peace and conflict.

The findings confirm our main expectation; [[energy dependency
**pacifies importers** against their importers]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Further [[analyses]{.underline} [suggest]{.underline}]{.mark} that the
level of [[trade in]{.mark}]{.underline} coal and oil, the more fungible
of the two [[energy]{.mark} sources]{.underline}, seem to have no effect
on the propensity of MID initiation while higher levels of natural gas
and electricity trade seem to [[pacify importers against their]{.mark}
[exporters]{.mark}]{.underline}. These findings reflect Bell and Long's
\[91\] argument that [[the more global]{.underline}]{.mark} the market
becomes for a [[trade]{.mark} commodity]{.underline}, i.e., the easier
importer countries can shift to other suppliers, [[the less
reason]{.underline}]{.mark} these [[importers will]{.underline}]{.mark}
feel the need to coerce their exporters by
[[employ]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[militarized
force]{.underline}]{.mark}. Our random coefficient models also indicate
that the pacifying effect of energy trade varies by region; for
instance, Eastern European importers seem to cultivate more peaceful
relations with their energy suppliers than Western European importers.

Being one of the first to cover the globe over an extensive
period---from 1978 to 2010---, this study inevitably overlooks certain
region- and technology-specific details. Noting the exploratory nature
of this study, we adopted an inductive approach and chose to strike a
balance between being theoretically agnostic while maintaining
analytical tractability. In doing so, we also hope our findings will
motivate future research on identifying systematic factors that
condition the relationship between energy dependence of an importer and
the foreign policy it formulates towards its suppliers.

Despite this inductive approach, our [findings are robust
to]{.underline} various **[empirical specifications]{.underline}**.
Means of incorporating such details into our framework suggest several
promising avenues of future research. The first of these avenues relates
to how technological change reshapes energy dependence. [[Advancements
in]{.underline}]{.mark} oil [refining t[ech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology
over the last two decades, for instance, might have
[[allow]{.underline}]{.mark}ed [[refineries]{.underline}
[to]{.underline}]{.mark} process a wider-range of crude mixes, hence
making them [[**less-dependent** on]{.underline}]{.mark} a specific type
of [[oil]{.underline}]{.mark}. Advances in LNGfication may similarly be
making natural gas more fungible.19 Global investments in degasification
and regasification capacity have been moving natural gas towards being a
truly global commodity, potentially decreasing the political lock-in
effect pipelines were arguably creating otherwise. Logistic bottlenecks
constitute another detail that our analyses overlook. Energy suppliers
or transit countries who also command over logistical means to deliver
may be more valuable to importers when such means (such as oil or LNG
tankers) are scarce.

Today, [[NOAA and]{.underline}]{.mark} the U.S. Department of Energy
([[DOE]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[signed]{.underline}]{.mark} a memorandum
of [[agreement]{.underline}]{.mark} (MOA) [[on]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}arine [[c]{.underline}]{.mark}arbon

[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} an **[[important]{.underline}]{.mark}**
pathway [[to achieve]{.underline}]{.mark} the broader Biden
Administration goal for the U.S. to reach [[**net-zero**
emissions]{.underline}]{.mark} of greenhouse gases by 2050.

This MOA will formalize collaboration between NOAA and DOE to share
expertise on research and technology development, as well as avoid
duplicative work. The MOA makes clear that
[[combining]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[ocean science **expertise** of
NOAA with]{.underline}]{.mark} the carbon dioxide removal and energy
science and [[technology]{.underline} [**expertise** of
DOE]{.underline}]{.mark} will be a powerful way to advance the state of
marine carbon dioxide removal science and strengthen the existing

"The science is clear," said NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad, Ph.D.
"[[In order to **limit**]{.underline}]{.mark} global
[[warming]{.underline}]{.mark} to 1.5C or even 2C, we not only [[have to

also must remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This MOA, utilizing

#### CDR solves warming.

The world would have to remove hundreds of billions of tonnes of carbon
dioxide from the atmosphere to limit the rise in global temperatures to
1.5°C this century. Even the less ambitious [[2°]{.mark}C climate target
[is now]{.mark} **virtually [out of reach]{.mark}** [without]{.mark}
large volumes of [carbon capture and]{.mark} carbon dioxide removal
([CDR]{.mark})]{.underline}, alongside aggressive cuts to emissions.

The role that such carbon-management technologies have to play in
meeting climate targets has long proved controversial. The
[[I]{.mark}ntergovernmental [P]{.mark}anel on [C]{.mark}limate
[C]{.mark}hange [has said]{.mark} some amount of [carbon
management]{.mark} will be "**[unavoidable]{.mark}**" [to reach]{.mark}
the [net-zero]{.mark} emissions required to stabilise global
temperatures]{.underline}. But others have pointed out that technologies
that could achieve this haven't yet been proven to work at the scale
needed, and relying on them risks providing an excuse to continue
emitting as usual.

There is a "debate across scientists that CDR is both essential and
impossible", says Candelaria Bergero at the University of California,
Irvine. "There are some people saying that [[without CDR, **we are
doomed**]{.underline}]{.mark}," she says, adding that others say "we are
banking on some almost fictional technology that we think we will have,
and we're putting future generations at risk".

To get a better handle on what is at stake, Bergero and her colleagues
used a simple climate model to estimate the consequences of failing to
manage CO2 across hundreds of different emissions scenarios consistent
with the Paris Agreement target to keep the rise in global temperatures
well below 2°Cs. These scenarios included carbon-removal technologies
like direct air capture as well as nature-based approaches like tree
planting. They also included varying amounts of carbon capture and
storage applied to emissions from power plants and other industrial
sources.

They found that [[failing to capture]{.mark} or remove any [CO2
add]{.mark}ed about **[0.5°]{.mark}C** [to]{.mark} global average
[temperatures]{.mark} at the end of the century, [while failing to
deliver half of]{.mark} the carbon [management]{.mark} assumed in the
scenarios [added]{.mark} about 0[.28°]{.mark}C of warming. This [would
make it]{.mark} **nearly [impossible]{.mark}** [to limit]{.mark} the
[rise]{.mark} in temperature [to 1.5]{.mark}°C]{.underline}, even in a
scenario where temperatures breach 1.5°C but then are brought back down.

The [[2°]{.mark}C warming target]{.underline} might still be just about
possible without any carbon management. However, the researchers found
it [would [require]{.mark} **extremely steep [emissions cuts]{.mark}**
[equivalent to 16 per cent per year from 2015 onwards]{.mark}. Such a
**rapid decline** seems unlikely given that global emissions have
increased over the past decade]{.underline}, says Bergero.

publication lags, its under-appreciation of positive climate feedback
loops and natural conservatism in achieving global consensus (\'erring
on the side of least drama\'). [[Heating]{.underline}]{.mark} \> 2^o^C
[[would bring '**numerous risks**]{.mark} to natural and human

carbon dioxide emissions need to halve by 2030 compared with 2010 levels
and reach net zero by 2050 to limit global heating 1.50C, or 45% by 2030
and reach net zero by 2070 to remain 20C. Net zero does not mandate
cessation of manmade carbon dioxide emissions, merely that they occur at
the same rate as their \'draw down' (removal) from the atmosphere. Many
have called for radical decarbonisation and further research. Radical
[[**decarbonisation** needs to proceed **urgently**]{.underline}]{.mark}
according to actions based on current knowledge and informed opinion.
Certainly, research should be performed (e.g. into carbon capture and
storage technologies) but should not delay immediate action to reduce
emissions. However, we cannot wait for certainty, or rely on innovation
and technology to engineer us out of imminent climate collapse. Even if
the IPCC 1.5^o^C and 2^o^C target horizons remain valid, we will need to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions by over 10% year-on-year to 2030 (i.e.
approximately double the 5.4% annual emissions reduction measured during
the COVID-19 pandemic 'anthropause' of 2020).

### Impact\-\--Economy\-\--2NC

#### Climate change will crush corporations without proper mitigation 

Himanshu **Gupta, 24**, (Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer,
ClimateAi )"Data to decisions: How technology can solve a \$1.2 trillion
climate change
problem"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/02/data-decisions-technology-climate-change-problem/

After a summer with the hottest stretch in [120,000
years](https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/27/world/july-hottest-month-record-climate/index.html),
climate change alarm bells are ringing.

[But companies haven't yet fully accounted for the profound risks of a
warming planet -- from shifting weather patterns to rising sea levels to
environmental impacts that threaten natural capital, infrastructure,
operations and supply chains. In fact, climate risks threaten to cause
\$1.26 trillion in revenue losses for suppliers within the next five
years, a ]{.underline}[CDP Global Supply Chain
Report](https://www.cdp.net/en/research/global-reports/transparency-to-transformation)[ found.]{.underline}

These factors, plus geopolitics, war and inflation, significantly impact
corporate top and bottom lines. But when peace comes and inflation
cools, climate change will continue, prompting the urgent need to
mitigate risk and build resilience within supply chains.

[Corporate leaders want to mitigate climate risk]{.underline} -- but
it's complicated. When it comes to climate change, companies have two
major pain points: a data problem and, subsequently, a data-driven
decision-making problem.

Forward-thinking business leaders are proactively taking steps to tackle
some of these issues, from using emerging technologies to forging new
collaborative efforts. Climate data and decision-making problems

[Companies' decision-makers need accessible, reliable and contextual
climate information to understand their risks and increase resilience.
But climate data can be hard to find, understand and incorporate into
decision-making]{.underline}.

Too often, companies rely upon anecdotal and historical data to inform
their operational and strategic decision-making. But climate change is
here and creating profound new volatility. What's more, the past is no
longer a reliable predictor of the future. That means businesses have
considerable knowledge gaps as they set and operationalize their
strategies. Industry leaders must tackle this complex challenge as
climate change accelerates and brings even more extremes.

In general, there is [a lack of data about climate change-caused extreme
weather events that pose some of the greatest risks to companies and
their supply chains.]{.underline} These events are, by nature, rare.
Historical observational data doesn't go back very far, as reliable
satellite technology is only about 50 years old. That means such
recorded instances seem infrequent but have become more common in the
past 20 years as climate change has worsened.

Improving climate data for business

[To access more data, companies can leverage emerging climate
technologies, which have advanced significantly in recent years, for
more accurate and comprehensive measurements.]{.underline} These include
remote sensing technologies, which involve using satellites, aircraft or
drones equipped with sensors and cameras to monitor and capture data
about the Earth's surface.

They can also involve Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as weather
stations and environmental sensors, which are increasingly used to
collect real-time climate data at a localized level. Plus, advanced
climate models that leverage machine learning and artificial
intelligence (AI) algorithms can process vast amounts of climate data,
identifying patterns, trends and correlations that might not be evident
through conventional analysis. These technologies can enhance climate
data processing and support predictive modelling efforts in an
accessible way.

Similar to buzzy new-age generative AI models such as ChatGPT, AI-based
weather and climate forecasting models train on simulated climate data
(without historical data) and transfer these learnings onto
observational data. They simulate centuries of extreme weather events to
get more accurate data to learn about these types of events. They then
use these learnings for forward-looking forecasts. For example, advanced
forecasting tools can reveal the shifting patterns of the hurricane
season in the United States, giving key insights for businesses about
the long-term risk to their operating sites, suppliers and key ports.

"[By leveraging actionable climate data, companies are more prepared for
the major shifts in global temperatures, precipitation and other
patterns that climate change brings]{.underline}."

--- Himanshu Gupta, Chief Executive Officer, ClimateAi

Integrating climate data into decision-making

[Once companies have improved climate data, they must integrate it into
decision-making strategies. Advanced climate tools can translate this
data into impacts that matter most to businesses by factoring in
industry-specific data.]{.underline}

For example, when applied to agriculture, AI that models not just
weather and climate conditions but also crop phenology and
location-specific characteristics can help agribusinesses make
climate-smart decisions. That can mean taking short-term actions,
including moving a planting window to avoid rain, or long-term
endeavours, such as developing certain seed traits to deal with future
droughts.

By leveraging actionable [climate data, companies are more prepared for
the major shifts in global temperatures, precipitation and other
patterns that climate change brings. Understanding business-specific
climate change impacts is key for enabling better operational decisions,
including sourcing, contracting, demand planning and logistics, as well
as decisions on long-term investments and strategy.]{.underline}

Climate data and decision-making in action

Climate data and technology [can also build business continuity and
capture new opportunities. For example, businesses turn to AI-based
climate forecasting technologies during hurricane season to analyze the
impact on sales or sourcing regions, identifying which commodities have
high risk and what actions companies can take to ensure their supply
chains are safe.]{.underline}

The [[N]{.underline}]{.mark}ational [[O]{.underline}]{.mark}ceanic and
[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}tmospheric [[A]{.underline}]{.mark}dministration
[[faces]{.underline}]{.mark} a new round of [[budget
cuts]{.underline}]{.mark} that would
**[[undermine]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [[agency\'s ability to provide
services]{.underline}]{.mark} that millions of Americans need, including
hurricane research and weather forecasting, according to a group of
former top officials.

The White House\'s proposed FY2026 budget calls for cuts totaling \$1.3
billion across all NOAA programs, with particularly steep reductions
targeting the National Marine Fisheries Service and NOAA\'s research
division. The proposed [[cuts follow]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[loss of
hundreds of **experienced** scientists]{.underline}]{.mark} and
forecasters during the DOGE-led rounds of federal workforce reductions
earlier this year. Across all of NOAA, departing employees
[took]{.underline} with them a combined [**27,000 years** of
institutional knowledge]{.underline}, according to Craig McLean, former
director of the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research.

[[NOAA]{.underline}]{.mark} has been [[forced to
hire]{.underline}]{.mark} more than [[100 personnel
to]{.underline}]{.mark} re-[[fill critical roles]{.underline}]{.mark} at
the National Weather Service, which is so short-staffed that it has
[[had to **scale back** weather-balloon launches]{.underline}]{.mark}
and reduce hours at several stations.

\"The Weather Service mentality is to produce the forecast and warnings
at all costs,\" said John Sokic, former director of National Weather
Service Congressional Affairs, during a recent briefing with former NOAA
officials. \"But as the staff continues to work crazy hours over time,
12-hour shifts, they\'re going to burn out. There will be an impact.
There will be missed warnings.\"

The [[budget constraints]{.underline}]{.mark} would [[**force difficult
choices** across NOAA\'s operations]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} agency\'s [[radar
network]{.underline},]{.mark} designed in the 1980s and installed in the
1990s, is [[expected to function **only through
2035**]{.underline}]{.mark} without significant upgrades. [[Weather
Service facilities]{.underline}]{.mark}, many more than 30 years old and
operating around the clock, [[are
**deteriorating**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The National Data [[Buoy
program]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[operated under flat
funding]{.underline}]{.mark} for 12 years, [[**forcing** officials to
shift]{.underline}]{.mark} from preventive maintenance [[to reactive
repairs]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The National Marine Fisheries Service faces particularly severe cuts.
Steve Mirowski, former chief scientist at the National Marine Fisheries
Service, warned that the [reductions **threaten**]{.underline} a
management [system]{.underline} that has been highly successful. Under
current programs, U.S. fisheries generate \$321 billion in annual sales
and support 2.3 million jobs. Since 2000, 50 depleted fisheries have
been rebuilt, including some of the nation\'s most lucrative.

\"The bottom line is that the [[cuts to]{.underline}]{.mark} NMFS
[[personnel and budget have]{.underline}]{.mark} already
**[[significantly degraded]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [[capacity
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[agency to fill its]{.underline}]{.mark}
statutory [[obligations]{.underline}]{.mark},\" said Mirowski.
\"Additional cuts as proposed in FY2026 will threaten a system that is
not broken and is currently producing significant economic benefits for
the country.\"

#### NOAA is [hanging]{.underline} by a [thread]{.underline}\-\--the [agency]{.underline} still [retains]{.underline} some of their [capabilities]{.underline}.

The [[proposal]{.underline}]{.mark} also aims to [[**slim down**
NOAA]{.underline}]{.mark}\'s [[investment in]{.underline}]{.mark} some
of its premier [[satellite]{.underline}]{.mark} technology, called
geostationary satellites, [[by **44%**]{.underline}]{.mark} compared to
current levels. The agency currently has five in orbit, which provide
much of the data critical for weather forecasts, as well as weather and
climate research and coastal security. The agency was in the process of
developing the next generation of its satellites, which would have
included several new instruments; the next was scheduled to go into
orbit in 2032. The cuts to the program will jeopardize that plan and
hamper the progression of key science, according to NOAA officials
familiar with the program who were not authorized to speak publicly.

The budget for the National Weather Service would remain intact.

The overall impacts of the cuts would ripple into Americans\' lives,
says Rep, Zoe Lofgren of California, the top Democrat on the House
Science, Space, and Technology Committee. \"What NOAA does is crucial to
the lifesaving weather research and services that it provides to the
American people,\" she says. \"This [[budget will leave NOAA **hollowed
out**]{.underline}]{.mark} and unable to perform its life-saving work.\"
The budget draft has not yet been finalized and could change after
review.

White House Office of Management and Budget spokesperson Alexandra
McCandless wrote in an email that \"[[no final funding decisions have
been made]{.underline}]{.mark}.\" The U.S. Department of Commerce
didn\'t immediately respond to NPR\'s request for comment.

Project 2025 provided a preview

Many of the proposed changes echo concepts outlined in Project 2025, the
conservative policy blueprint organized by the Washington, DC-based
Heritage Foundation think tank, a document the Trump administration has
followed closely in recent months.

[[Project 2025 calls for NOAA to]{.underline}]{.mark}
\"[[be]{.underline}]{.mark} broken up and
**[[downsized]{.underline}]{.mark}**,\" keeping the pieces that many
Americans are familiar with, like the National Weather Service, and
dismantling many of NOAA\'s other offices. The proposed moves follow
that rubric, such as shifting the Fisheries Service to another agency.

It also called the agency part of \"the main drivers of the climate
change alarm industry\" and laid out ways NOAA\'s climate science
research could be curtailed, some of which have been proposed in the
budget document.

Decades of research by thousands of scientists in the U.S. and
internationally, have linked rising atmospheric carbon dioxide with a
warming Earth. Human activities, like burning coal, gas and other fossil
fuels, are the primary cause of rising greenhouse gas concentrations in
the atmosphere.

Other disruptions at the agency

Earlier this week, hundreds of NOAA employees who had been fired in
February, then re-hired under a court order, were once again fired. The
most recent firings occurred after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the
Trump administration could move forward with firing those probationary
orders, at least for now.

Cuts to probationary staff, in tandem with the proposed slashing of the
research and operations budgets, could hobble the agency\'s ability to
keep Americans safe, says Andy Hazelton, a hurricane expert who was
among those re-fired this week. \"[[NOAA was already **stretched
thin**]{.underline}]{.mark} and understaffed,\" he says.
\"[[It\'s]{.underline}]{.mark} going to go from stretched thin to
**[[decimated]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\"

NOAA provides most of the raw data and the models that predict
hurricanes, and the hurricane forecasts many Americans see on their
phones or TVs are created by the agency. Hazelton says reducing the
research and observation capabilities of the agency could regress
hurricane forecasting capability by the equivalent of decades.

The cuts to the research wing, OAR, says former NOAA Deputy
Undersecretary Mary Glackin, who served over several administrations,
would \"decimate the laboratory systems and the relationship that we
have with universities,\" who work in partnership with the agency on
many of its climate, weather, and other research projects. The proposed
changes would be \"monumental,\" she says.

NOAA provides much of the raw data required for weather forecasts via a
wide array of data-collection tools, from satellites to ocean buoys to
weather balloons. And its scientists run models that turn that data into
useful information, like those short-term weather forecasts, seasonal
outlooks and long-term looks at how climate change is affecting Earth.

The agency also includes offices that manage the billions of dollars of
U.S. fishery resources, like tuna, cod, scallops and crab. Its
scientists figure out how many fish can be caught in order to sustain
fish populations in the long term, a task legally required by law.
Interruptions to fisheries operations have resulted in the past in
delays in season opening or lower annual quotas fishermen are allowed to
catch.

concerns. The National Snow and Ice Data Center, which maintains a
long-term record of sea ice at both poles, has announced that its sea

crucial for hurricane forecasts, particularly for rapidly intensifying

NOAA's Climate.gov website was the agency's primary climate portal for
the public. The site published climate updates, data, maps, explainers,
and educational products designed for teachers. In late May, the staff
that produced this content was terminated, according to the Guardian,
and the website was taken offline as of June 24, 2025.

In another example, the Trump administration halted work on the upcoming
National Climate Assessment and dismissed the report's authors, even
though the report is required by Congress. As of July 1, 2025, the
website that hosts National Climate Assessment reports was offline. (You
can read an archived version of the most recent report via this NOAA

The National Climate Assessment is written by scientists at more than a
dozen federal agencies and provides a comprehensive yet user-friendly
review of the impacts of climate change across the United States, as
well as the risks faced in different parts of the country. The
government is required to publish a new report every four years.

Mining\", <https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/deep-seabed-mining/?utm> AGF

**[Deep seabed mining is the extraction of critical mineral resources
from the ocean floor. The deep seabed has valuable resources like
manganese, nickel, cobalt, and rare earth elements. Critical minerals
are used in everything from defense systems and batteries to smartphones
and medical devices. Access to these minerals is a key factor in the
health and resilience of U.S. supply chains. Before a U.S. citizen,
including a U.S. company, may engage in deep seabed mining activities in
ocean floor areas beyond national jurisdiction, they must obtain
appropriate government authorizations. The Deep Seabed Hard Mineral
Resources Act (DSHMRA) charged NOAA with the responsibility for issuing
to U.S. companies licenses for exploration and permits for commercial
recovery of polymetallic nodules containing manganese, nickel, cobalt,
and copper from the deep seabed in areas beyond national jurisdiction.
For ocean floor areas within U.S. national jurisdiction, the primary
legal authority for offshore mining activities is the Outer Continental
Shelf Lands Act, which is administered by the Department of the
Interior's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. The International Seabed
Authority (ISA) regulates deep seabed mining in areas beyond national
jurisdiction for countries that are parties to the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The U.S. is not a party to
UNCLOS. Under DSHMRA, the U.S. may issue exploration licenses and
commercial recovery permits to U.S. companies in areas beyond national
jurisdiction, provided all statutory and regulatory requirements are
met. On April 24, 2025, the President signed an Executive Order
establishing policies to advance U.S. leadership in seabed mineral
exploration and responsible commercial recovery, with a focus on both
resource extraction and environmental conservation.]{.underline}**

to get funding to manage ocean and coasts"4/6/24
\[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/06/indigenous-american-tribes-funding-manage-ocean-coasts\]

This month, three Indigenous American tribes on the west and east coasts
will collectively receive nearly \$755,000 in federal funding to manage
ocean and coastal problems, as well as engage in partnerships to offset
the effects of the climate crisis in their regions. The tribes' projects
will blend together Indigenous knowledge and scientific data to build
innovative strategies around coastal resilience.

On Monday, the federal agency [National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration ([Noaa]{.mark}), and the US Department of Commerce
announced that the [Makah]{.mark} Tribe in Washington, the Santa Ynez
Band of [Chumash]{.mark} Indians in California and the
[Penobscot]{.mark} Nation in Maine will be individually awarded between
\$200,000 and [\$290,000 for their two-year
projects]{.mark}]{.underline}. The funding comes from the Biden
administration's bipartisan Infrastructure Act, which provided [Noaa
with nearly \$3bn to facilitate environmental stewardship, build
climate-resilient]{.mark} coasts and [support infrastructure around
weather forecasting from 2022 to 2026]{.mark}.

Amid warming waters and sea level rise, tribal engagement "is critical
to be able to really benefit from that knowledge and round out our
perspectives of how to act together in managing oceans and coasts",
Betsy Nicholson, the north regional director for Noaa's office for
coastal management, told the Guardian. "Tribes have a long history that
we do not have in terms of having been through some of these changes
before, so it's an incredibly meaningful relationship. It takes funds to
have the capacity to maintain that participation."

Noaa has engaged with Indigenous communities on coastal and ocean
management for many years. This funding will allow the tribes to hire
staff, attend convenings with state and federal governments and [to
[incorporate their traditional ecological knowledge into infrastructure
planning on the coast and in oceans]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"In many cases, we are using data and tools to make decisions on where
to site aquaculture, where to site offshore wind projects," said
Nicholson. "Those tools don't necessarily include the traditional
ecological knowledge and their perspective."

The Makah Tribe will use the funds to continue work around ocean
mapping, as well as to teach younger generations how to govern the
collection, ownership and use of their community's information,
otherwise known as tribal data sovereignty. The Santa Ynez Band of
Chumash Indians plan to use the money to define their values around
ocean and coastal management, which may include prioritizing the
protection of marine mammals.

In Maine, The Penobscot Nation will conduct more research on the
historical significance of their waterways, such as identifying
submerged archaeological sites that were once tribal lands before the
sea level rose thousands of years ago. Chuck Loring, a Penobscot Nation
member and the tribe's director of natural resources said they will also
use the funds to share the knowledge that they learn from state and
federal governments with four other tribes in the area -- Houlton Band
of Maliseet Indians, Mi'kmaq Nation, Passamaquoddy Tribe at Motahkomikuk
and Passamaquoddy Tribe at Sipayik.

"We're going to try to continue identifying tribal priorities for
offshore and inshore ocean environments, increasing the tribal
involvement," said Loring, "as well as supporting awareness of
ocean-related issues of climate change and energy projects."

For instance, he said, the tribe is concerned that birds, bats and fish
may be killed by the offshore wind turbines that the state plans to
erect along the coast. They also want to ensure that a mitigation plan
is in place so that oil leaks from the turbines don't contribute to
water pollution.

Loring said that the funding will provide them with the [[resources and
time to engage with the state about such infrastructure
projects,]{.mark} given that Indigenous voices have largely been left
out of discussions since the tribes are working over capacity. He hopes
that the partnerships will help the Penobscot Nation learn more about
their own history, which has partially been forgotten due to
colonialism.]{.underline}

["We obviously had quite a connection to the ocean. We've kind of lost
that since we don't have a significant landholding down there," Loring
said. "We're looking to rekindle that, to educate ourselves a little bit
more."]{.underline}

The **[[N]{.underline}]{.mark}**ational
**[[O]{.underline}]{.mark}**ceanic and [A]{.mark}tmospheric
**[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**dministration announced Thursday that [it
would [dedicate up to \$15 million in tribal-specific
funding]{.underline}]{.mark} [as part of a broader \$100 million habitat
restoration and coastal resilience grant program.]{.underline}

**[[The set-aside funding will be available to U.S. tribes, Alaska
Native corporations and tribal-affiliated]{.mark}]{.underline}**
organizations as part of funding made available through the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law. The tribal allocation came in direct response to
feedback from tribes, according to NOAA\'s announcement.

The broader program aims to support projects that restore marine,
estuarine, coastal or Great Lakes ecosystems, with a focus on rebuilding
sustainable fisheries and recovering threatened and endangered species.
Projects can range from planning and assessments to engineering design
and monitoring.

\"Under the Biden-Harris Administration, the Department of Commerce has
delivered historic amounts of funding for habitat restoration and
coastal resilience that will [help strengthen the economies of coastal
communities across America,\" Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in a
statement. \"These investments have been transformative and will
continue to support Tribes and communities on the front lines of the
climate crisis, sustain our nation\'s fisheries and protect ecosystems
from the impacts of climate change for years to come.\"]{.underline}

NOAA indicated it would prioritize projects that demonstrate broad
stakeholder and community support, encouraging proposals that
incorporate \"meaningful strategies\" to engage diverse community
groups, including tribes and underserved communities. The agency\'s
announcement noted that restoration activities such as enhancing coastal
wetlands and rebuilding coral reefs can strengthen both ecosystem and
community resilience.

\"Through funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, [[NOAA is
committed]{.mark} to working with partners, including t[ribes]{.mark}
and underserved communities, to realize the environmental, cultural and
economic benefits of habitat restoration,\" said Janet Coit, assistant
administrator for NOAA Fisheries.]{.underline}

The funding represents the latest round of grants through NOAA\'s
Community-based Habitat Restoration Program, which has helped implement
more than 2,200 coastal habitat restoration projects since 1996. Those
projects have restored more than 94,000 acres of habitat and opened more
than 4,400 stream miles for fish passage, according to the announcement.

Applications for the current round of funding are due by April 16, 2025.
[[NOAA]{.mark} indicated it would [provide]{.mark} technical
[assistance]{.mark} and oversight to help design and [implement
projects,]{.mark} working closely with [tribal, state, local and
non-profit partners in the field]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

activity that could change the Earth's radiation budget (ERB), including
[[solar]{.underline} [geoengineering]{.underline}]{.mark}. \[2\] To
date, NOAA is the only federal agency that has received funding
explicitly to study SRM. Since 2020, NOAA's ERB Program has initiated
various research activities on solar geoengineering, such as atmospheric
modeling, stratospheric observations, and laboratory activities to
understand the physical impacts of stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI)
and marine cloud brightening (MCB).

In 2022, NOAA's ERB Program jointly hosted a workshop with DOE to
identify research gaps related to Marine Cloud Brightening (MCB). In
2024, Congress further directed NOAA "in coordination with NASA and the
Department of Energy, as appropriate, to improve the understanding of
the impact of atmospheric aerosols on radiative forcing, as well as on
the formation of clouds, precipitation, and extreme weather and to
develop plans for sustained observations of the stratosphere. \[3\]
Further, [[NOAA]{.underline}]{.mark} is encouraged to [[coordinate with

also notes that Alaska is warming at a rate that is two to three times
faster than the lower 48 states. The [funding provided by NOAA through
the Inflation Reduction Act will support the development and
co-production of new products and decision-support tools made in
partnership with Alaskan communities and will provide these communities
with increased access to much-needed data and information collected by
NOAA.]{.underline} In doing so, the funding will help fulfill

#### Arctic data is key to predicting the future of global climate change 

Issam **AHMED,24,** (Health, science and environment reporter at AFP)
"Sink to source: Arctic tundra emitting more carbon than it
absorbs"\[https://phys.org/news/2024-12-source-arctic-emitting-carbon-absorbs.html#google_vignette\]

After locking carbon dioxide in its frozen soil for millennia, the
[Arctic tundra is undergoing a dramatic transformation, driven by
frequent wildfires that are turning it into a net source of carbon
dioxide emissions]{.underline}, a US agency said Tuesday his [stark
shift is detailed in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration\'s 2024 Arctic Report Card, which revealed that annual
surface air temperatures in the Arctic this year were the second-warmest
on record since 1900.]{.underline} \"Our observations now show that the
Arctic tundra, which is experiencing warming and increased wildfire, is
now emitting more carbon than it stores[, which will worsen climate
change impacts,\" said NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad. \"What happens
in the Arctic doesn\'t stay in the Arctic,\"]{.underline} Anna Virkkala
of the Woodwell Climate Research Center, who co-authored the report,
added to AFP. \"We should try to stop anthropogenic climate change as
soon as possible, [so that we can also stop the emissions from the
Arctic eventually as well.\" The finding is based on an average of
observations recorded from 2001-2020. Climate warming exerts dual
effects on the Arctic. While it stimulates plant productivity and
growth, which removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, it also leads
to increased surface air temperatures that cause permafrost to
thaw.]{.underline} [Thawing permafrost releases carbon previously
trapped in frozen soil as carbon dioxide and methane---two potent
greenhouse gases---through microbial decomposition. In 2024, Alaska
recorded its second-warmest permafrost temperatures on
record]{.underline}, the report said. Human-caused climate change is
also intensifying high-latitude wildfires, which have increased in
burned area, intensity, and associated carbon emissions. Wildfires not
only combust vegetation and soil organic matter, releasing carbon into
the atmosphere, but they also strip away insulating soil layers,
accelerating long-term permafrost thaw and its associated carbon
emissions. Since 2003, circumpolar wildfire emissions have averaged 207
million tons of carbon annually, according to NOAA. At the same time,
[Arctic terrestrial ecosystems have remained a consistent source of
methane]{.underline}. \"Last year, 2023, was the largest fire year on
record due to Canadian wildfires, which burned more than twice any other
year on record in Canada,\" report co-author Brendan Rogers said during
a press conference. The fires emitted nearly 400 million tons of
carbon---more than two-and-a-half times the emissions from all other
sectors in Canada combined, he added. Meanwhile, 2024 ranked as the
second-highest year for wildfire emissions within the Arctic Circle.

\'Alarming harbinger\'

Asked whether [the Arctic\'s shift from carbon sink to source might be
permanent]{.underline}, Rogers said it remains an open question. While
boreal forests further south still serve as carbon sinks, northern
regions are of greater concern. \"[The best as we can tell, permafrost
emissions are not going to dwarf fossil fuel emissions, but they are a
significant layer, and so they need to be accounted for,\"]{.underline}
he told AFP, adding that aggressively limiting human-caused warming
would stem the problem to some extent. Reacting to the news, Brenda
Ekwurzel, a climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists said
that \"[the climate catastrophe we\'re seeing in the Arctic is already
bringing consequences for communities around the world.\" \"The alarming
harbinger of a net carbon source being unleashed sooner rather than
later doesn\'t bode well. Once reached, many of these thresholds of
adverse impacts on ecosystems cannot be reversed.\"]{.underline} Warmer
temperatures are impacting wildlife too, with the report finding tundra
caribou numbers have decreased by 65 percent over the past two to three
decades---with summer heat disrupting their movements and survival,
alongside changes to winter snow and ice conditions. Surprisingly,
however, Alaska\'s ice seal populations remain healthy. The report found
no long-term negative impacts on body condition, age of maturity,
pregnancy rates, or pup survival for the four species of ice
seals---ringed, bearded, spotted, and ribbon---inhabiting the Bering,
Chukchi, and Beaufort seas.

Efforts"\--\[https://sciencecouncil.noaa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Key-Messages.pdf\]

Carbon Dioxide Removal:

What is it and why is it needed[? Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) refers to
a portfolio of techniques that are used to remove greenhouse gasses from
the atmosphere and lock them away permanently in secure
reservoirs]{.underline}. CDR specifically references techniques that
remove dioxide from the atmosphere. carbon CDR is now considered to be
an essential component of [successful strategies for limiting warming to
1.5 -- 2 °C. Meeting this target will require increasing reliance on CDR
technologies in addition to a rapid transition to low/zero carbon energy
sources.]{.underline} Examples of CDR methods include: Macroalgal
Cultivation, Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE), Coastal Blue Carbon
(CBC), Direct Air and Ocean Capture (DAC/DOC), and Ocean Fertilization
(OF).

Why is NOAA involved in CDR? [NOAA's existing observational network and
research programs position it to lead in the analysis of impact,
effectiveness, feasibility, and risk of many CDR
techniques.]{.underline} NOAA was created more than 50 years ago to
study linkages between the ocean and atmosphere. Assessing the
effectiveness of CDR approaches is directly related to its mission. How
is NOAA primed to engage? [NOAA's emphasis on big-picture, long-term
monitoring and its research capabilities are ideally suited to
understand, evaluate, and verify public and private
entities']{.underline} exploration of CDR efforts and their potential
for success. Existing mandates, programs, and activities already
intersect with CDR research:

● NOAA's global to coastal observing networks and data assimilation

● NOAA's earth system and regional ocean modeling

● NOAA's ecosystem research

● NOAA's management role and stakeholder relationships

to activities that increase the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide
absorbed and held by the ocean. The ]{.underline}[Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/)[ considers carbon
dioxide removal]{.underline}, along with rapid and deep emissions
reductions over the next 10-20 years, critical to avoid the worst
impacts of climate change. All climate scenarios that keep global
temperatures below 1.5°C or 2°C above the pre-industrial time period
require both immediate and deep reductions of all greenhouse gas
emissions, as well as removing previously emitted carbon dioxide from
the atmosphere. The mCDR research sector is growing rapidly worldwide,
supported by strong interest from industry and investors.

"As we confront the growing challenges of climate change, it's crucial
that we have robust and consistent methods for managing and sharing data
in emerging fields like marine carbon dioxide removal," said Steve Thur,
Ph.D., NOAA assistant administrator for Oceanic and Atmospheric
Research. ["NOAA has long been known as an honest broker of sound
science. This partnership will help us build a strong data management
foundation for mCDR research, enabling more efficient collaboration and
accelerating our understanding of these important
technologies."]{.underline}

The CRADA will focus on the development of best practices for consistent
metadata, data and terms. It will emphasize the need to assess the
efficacy, scalability, impacts, measurement, reporting, and verification
efforts of mCDR technologies. These guidelines will be applied across
research efforts funded and supported by programs within NOAA and Carbon
to Sea and will provide mCDR data management guidelines for researchers
worldwide.

NOAA will contribute its subject matter expertise and technical data
management capabilities to the partnership. Carbon to Sea, drawing on
its network of ocean science data experts, will lead the development of
community-led data management best practices through user requirements,
literature reviews, stakeholder input, public comment periods and
training workshops.

This new partnership will build on the [National Academies' research
strategy](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/a-research-strategy-for-ocean-carbon-dioxide-removal-and-sequestration) (2022), [NOAA's

"Given the urgency of the climate challenge we face, this [partnership
with NOAA is an important step towards responsibly assessing the
viability of mCDR,"]{.underline} said Antonius Gagern, Executive
Director of the Carbon to Sea Initiative. "We look forward to working
with [NOAA to establish strong and aligned data guidelines to help

### CDR Key\-\--2NC

#### CDR is key

covering all things environmental; NewScientist; "Climate could warm
another 0.5°C if we fail to capture far more CO2";

The world would have to remove hundreds of billions of tonnes of carbon
dioxide from the atmosphere to limit the rise in global temperatures to
1.5°C this century. Even the less ambitious [[2°]{.mark}C climate target
[is now]{.mark} **virtually [out of reach]{.mark}** [without]{.mark}
large volumes of [carbon capture and]{.mark} carbon dioxide removal
([CDR]{.mark})]{.underline}, alongside aggressive cuts to emissions.

The role that such carbon-management technologies have to play in
meeting climate targets has long proved controversial. The
[[I]{.mark}ntergovernmental [P]{.mark}anel on [C]{.mark}limate
[C]{.mark}hange [has said]{.mark} some amount of [carbon
management]{.mark} will be "**[unavoidable]{.mark}**" [to reach]{.mark}
the [net-zero]{.mark} emissions required to stabilise global
temperatures]{.underline}. But others have pointed out that technologies
that could achieve this haven't yet been proven to work at the scale
needed, and relying on them risks providing an excuse to continue
emitting as usual.

There is a "debate across scientists that CDR is both essential and
impossible", says Candelaria Bergero at the University of California,
Irvine. "There are some people saying that [[without CDR, **we are
doomed**]{.underline}]{.mark}," she says, adding that others say "we are
banking on some almost fictional technology that we think we will have,
and we're putting future generations at risk".

To get a better handle on what is at stake, Bergero and her colleagues
used a simple climate model to estimate the consequences of failing to
manage CO2 across hundreds of different emissions scenarios consistent
with the Paris Agreement target to keep the rise in global temperatures
well below 2°Cs. These scenarios included carbon-removal technologies
like direct air capture as well as nature-based approaches like tree
planting. They also included varying amounts of carbon capture and
storage applied to emissions from power plants and other industrial
sources.

They found that [[failing to capture]{.mark} or remove any [CO2
add]{.mark}ed about **[0.5°]{.mark}C** [to]{.mark} global average
[temperatures]{.mark} at the end of the century, [while failing to
deliver half of]{.mark} the carbon [management]{.mark} assumed in the
scenarios [added]{.mark} about 0[.28°]{.mark}C of warming. This [would
make it]{.mark} **nearly [impossible]{.mark}** [to limit]{.mark} the
[rise]{.mark} in temperature [to 1.5]{.mark}°C]{.underline}, even in a
scenario where temperatures breach 1.5°C but then are brought back down.

The [[2°]{.mark}C warming target]{.underline} might still be just about
possible without any carbon management. However, the researchers found
it [would [require]{.mark} **extremely steep [emissions cuts]{.mark}**
[equivalent to 16 per cent per year from 2015 onwards]{.mark}. Such a
**rapid decline** seems unlikely given that global emissions have
increased over the past decade]{.underline}, says Bergero.

[requires removed atmospheric CO2 to be stored

meant by durably, and interpretations have varied from decades to
millennia. Using a reduced-complexity climate model, here we examined
the effect of Carbon Dioxide Removal with varying CO2 storage durations.
We found that storage duration substantially affects whether net zero
emissions achieve the desired temperature outcomes. With a typical
100-year storage duration, net zero CO2 emissions with 6 GtCO2 per year
residual emissions result in an additional warming of 0.8 °C by 2500
compared to permanent storage, thus putting the internationally agreed
temperature limits at risk. Our findings suggest that a CO2 storage
period of less than 1000 years is insufficient for neutralizing
remaining fossil CO2 emissions under net zero emissions. These results
reinforce the principle that credible neutralization claims using Carbon
Dioxide Removal in a net zero framework require balancing emissions with
removals of similar atmospheric residence time and storage reservoir,
e.g., geological or biogenic.

Introduction

Over the past decade, [**[net zero emissions]{.mark} has become t[he
guiding principle behind both national and corporate
commitments]{.mark}** [to meet global climate goals]{.mark} of limiting
global temperature change to well-below 2 °C relative to preindustrial
levels, as enshrined in the 2015 Paris Agreement]{.underline}. The
[concept of net zero arose as a result of two sets of findings: First,
**[stopping the world from warming requires]{.mark} near-complete
[elimination]{.mark} of the net emissions [of carbon
dioxide]{.mark}**]{.underline} (CO2)1,2, along with a [strong reduction
in non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions3,]{.underline} and second,
[[residual]{.underline}]{.mark} (hard-to-avoid) [[emissions]{.underline}
that **[cannot be]{.underline}**]{.mark} easily or effectively
[[reduced]{.mark} [need]{.mark} to be counterbalanced with
[C]{.mark}arbon [D]{.mark}ioxide [R]{.mark}emoval]{.underline} (CDR)4,5.
Countries and companies have used carbon removal and avoided emissions
credits to claim to be "carbon-neutral", and a multi-billion dollar
private market for carbon offsets6 and a large role for these
instruments in national climate targets have rapidly developed7.

#### CDR is crucial to avoid the worst effects of climate change

Dr. Conor **Hickey** et al **23**, Assistant Professor in Energy and
Climate at the University of Cambridge, researching the economic risks
of phasing out fossil fuels, 1/13/23, "Co2 removal is essential along
emissions cuts to limit global warming",

//maeve

[Carbon Dioxide Removal (**[CDR]{.mark}**) from the atmosphere **[is
crucial to limit global warming]{.mark}**, in addition to rapid cuts to
emissions [- that is the stark conclusion of]{.mark} today's first
[Oxford-led State of Carbon Dioxide Removal report.]{.mark}]{.underline}

More than 20 global CDR experts, led by Dr Steve Smith, from Oxford's
Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, came together to deliver
the blunt findings. In the comprehensive 120-page report, they warn
there is a large gap between how much CDR is needed to meet
international temperature targets and how much governments are aiming to
deliver. But, while the authors found a shortfall in policies to support
CDR spread, they report research, innovation and public awareness around
CDR are all rising fast

[[To limit warming to 2°C or lower]{.mark}, we need to accelerate
emissions reductions...[we]{.mark} also [need to increase carbon
removal, by]{.mark} restoring and enhancing ecosystems and rapidly
[scaling up new CDR methods]{.mark}]{.underline}

Dr Steve Smith

Dr Smith, Executive Director of Oxford Net Zero and CO2RE, [[the
national hub for greenhouse gas removal]{.mark}, and a lead author of
the report, [maintains, **'To limit warming to 2°C or lower**, we need
to]{.mark} accelerate emissions reductions...the findings of this report
are clear: we also need to **[increase carbon removal]{.mark}**,
**[by]{.mark}** restoring and enhancing ecosystems and **[rapidly
scaling up new CDR methods]{.mark}**]{.underline}.'

He adds, 'Many new methods are emerging with potential. Rather than
focusing on one or two options we should encourage a portfolio, so that
we get to net zero quickly without over-relying on any one method.\'

Meanwhile, Dr Oliver Geden of the German Institute for International and
Security Affairs, explains, '**[[CDR is not something we could do, but
something we absolutely have to do]{.underline}]{.mark}** to reach the
Paris Agreement temperature goal.'

#### CDR is essential for addressing emissions

**World Economic Forum 25**, The World Economic Forum is the
International Organization for Public-Private Cooperation. It provides a
global, impartial and not-for-profit platform for meaningful connection
between stakeholders to establish trust, and build initiatives for
cooperation and progress, 1/21/25, "Cost of different carbon removal
technologies",
https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/01/cost-of-different-carbon-removal-technologies/

[Carbon dioxide removal ([CDR) describes the process of extracting CO₂
from the atmosphere and storing it]{.mark} permanently [in]{.mark}
natural or engineered [reservoirs]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[It is
essential for addressing emissions]{.underline}]{.mark}** from sectors
where replacing fossil-based inputs with fully green alternatives is not
yet feasible, such as methane from livestock in agriculture, CO₂ from
cement production and emissions from aviation fuel combustion.
[[Tech]{.mark}nologies [like biochar and]{.mark} Direct Air Capture
([DAC]{.mark}), along with nature-based solutions like reforestation**[,
play a crucial role in offsetting these hard-to-abate emissions to
achieve net-zero goals.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[The World Economic Forum's First Movers Coalition is spearheading this
effort by aggregating leading companies]{.underline} who are committed
[to purchase durable]{.underline} and scalable carbon removal solutions,
targeting 50,000 tons of removal or \$25 million in contracts by 2030.
[[These pledges focus on solutions capable of storing CO₂ for over 1,000
years]{.mark} and scaling to megaton capacity by 2030 and gigaton
capacity by 2050.]{.underline}

#### Diversified CDR is the best strategy to get to net zero emissions

Mark **Dwortzan 25**, Communications Officer at the MIT Center for
Sustainability and Strategy, 1/29/25, " Smart Carbon Dioxide Removal
Yields Economic Environmental Benefits",
https://news.mit.edu/2025/smart-carbon-dioxide-removal-yields-economic-environmental-benefits-0129
//maeve

[[To provide a more comprehensive]{.mark} and actionable [analysis of
CDR, a new study by researchers at]{.mark} the [MIT]{.mark} Center for
Sustainability Science and Strategy (CS3) first [expands the option set
to include biochar]{.mark}]{.underline} (charcoal produced from plant
matter and stored in soil) and enhanced weathering (EW) (spreading
finely ground rock particles on land to accelerate storage of CO2 in
soil and water). The study then evaluates portfolios of all five options
--- in isolation and in combination --- to assess their capability to
meet the 1.5 C goal, and their potential impacts on land, energy, and
policy costs.

The study appears in the journal Environmental Research Letters. Aided
by their global multi-region, multi-sector Economic Projection and
Policy Analysis (EPPA) model, the MIT CS3 researchers produce three key
findings.

First, the most cost-effective, low-impact strategy that policymakers
can take to achieve global net-zero emissions --- an essential step in
meeting the 1.5 C goal --- is to diversify their CDR portfolio, rather
than rely on any single option. This approach minimizes overall cropland
and energy consumption, and negative impacts such as increased food
insecurity and decreased energy supplies.

[[By diversifying across multiple]{.mark} CDR [options]{.mark}, the
highest [CDR deployment of around 31.5 gigatons]{.mark} of CO2 per year
is achieved in 2100, while [also proving the most cost-effective
net-zero strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}. The study identifies BECCS and
biochar as most cost-competitive in removing CO2 from the atmosphere,
followed by EW, with DACCS as uncompetitive due to high capital and
energy requirements. While posing logistical and other challenges,
biochar and EW have the potential to improve soil quality and
productivity across 45 percent of all croplands by 2100.

"[**[Diversifying CDR portfolios is the most cost-effective net-zero
strategy]{.mark}** because [it avoids relying on a single CDR
option]{.mark}]{.underline}, thereby reducing and redistributing
negative impacts on agriculture, forestry, and other land uses, as well
as on the energy sector," says Solene Chiquier, lead author of the study
who was a CS3 postdoc during its preparation.

#### CDR is necessary to mitigate climate change

Jonathan **Haskett 24**, Environmental Policy Analyst, graduate of Johns
Hopkins University, Vice President at Education first, 11/2/24, "Carbon
Dioxide Removal (CDR): Its potential Role in Climate Change Mitigation",
https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R48258 //maeve

[[Rising global temperatures are associated with increasingly]{.mark}
frequent and [intense climate change impacts]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Scientific consensus finds that [[stabilizing global temperatures is
necessary to avoid increased]{.mark} climate [impacts.]{.mark} Studies
suggest that such [stabilization requires human-caused]{.mark} carbon
dioxide (**[CO2) emissions to be balanced by CO2 removals from the
atmosphere]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a condition known as net-zero carbon
dioxide (CO2) emissions. While reductions in human-caused emissions of
CO2 would be necessary to stabilize global temperatures, they may not be
sufficient. This is due in part to the difficulty in eliminating
emissions from some key economic sectors that are harder to decarbonize,
including the steel and cement industries. These emissions are likely to
persist after a program of emissions reductions and are known
as residual emissions.

[[Methods of further removing CO2 from the atmosphere may be necessary
to counterbalance residual emissions]{.underline}]{.mark}. Researchers
are enhancing nature-based techniques for increasing the uptake of
CO2 from the atmosphere by the land surface and oceans, known as carbon
sinks, as well as with recently developed technological methods. These
are known collectively as carbon dioxide removal (CDR). [[Almost all the
climate scenarios]{.underline}]{.mark} assessed by the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change [[that met specific global temperature
stabilization]{.underline}]{.mark} levels **[[used CDR to remove more
CO2 from the atmosphere than is being added by
emissions.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

CO2 is not the only greenhouse gas (GHG) with a climate effect. The
influence of GHGs on global temperatures is the combined effect of
CO2 and the other non-CO2 GHGs. Human-caused emissions of other
GHGs---including methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)---also increase global temperatures. No
commercially available method for removing non-CO2 GHGs from the
atmosphere exists. Therefore, to balance emissions of non-CO2 GHGs that
cannot be abated, additional removals of CO2 from the atmosphere would
be needed.

[There are several types and categories of CDR. [Some CDR methods
increase the uptake of CO2 on land by increasing forested area or
increasing carbon sequestered in soils]{.mark}. [Other methods]{.mark}
have been proposed that [increase the uptake of CO2 by the
oceans]{.mark} through biological or chemical methods. [A third
category]{.mark} of CDR [uses engineering methods]{.mark} such as
chemically capturing CO2 from the air or from the combustion of biofuel
energy crops and [storing it in geological
formations.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### UQ\-\--2AC

#### Trumps funding cuts kill all UQ

\[Alejandra **Borunda** et al; **2/27**/25; reporter on NPR\'s Climate
Desk, where she covers the intersection of climate change and health;
Trump administration layoffs hit NOAA, agency that forecasts weather,
hurricanes;
https://www.mynspr.org/2025-02-27/trump-administration-layoffs-hit-noaa-agency-that-forecasts-weather-hurricane;
DBSTM

[The [N]{.mark}ational [O]{.mark}ceanic and [A]{.mark}tmospheric
[A]{.mark}dministration **[began firing staff]{.mark} on
Thursday**]{.underline}, continuing a wave of **[[government-wide
layoff]{.mark}s ordered by the Trump administration]{.underline}**. The
terminations, which include staff at the National Weather Service, could
[[**impact weather forecasting** used by many]{.mark} people and
industries across the U.S. economy.]{.underline}

It wasn\'t immediately clear how many people were fired from NOAA.
Neither the agency nor the Department of Commerce, which oversees NOAA,
responded to messages seeking comment. NPR has confirmed the firings at
NOAA through multiple sources who asked for anonymity for fear of
retribution.

Some fired employees were given less than two hours to leave the office,
according to a source with direct knowledge who asked to remain
anonymous for fear of reprisal. They said staff that manages NOAA\'s
central weather forecasting models scrambled in that timeframe to
transfer access to employees who remain at NOAA.

[The agency joins many others across the federal government to have
their workforce cut in recent days.]{.underline} [The move is part of
the [Trump administration\'s efforts to **reduce the size of the federal
governmen**]{.mark}**t**.]{.underline} Thousands of scientists, doctors,
administrative employees, grant managers, and more have been affected in
the mass firings.

NPR has seen several copies of a termination letter for NOAA employees,
all of whom were in a \"probationary\" period with the agency; the
status is applied because they had either joined NOAA recently or been
promoted. The letters informed the employees that they were \"not fit
for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and/or skills
do not fit the Agency\'s current needs.\"

Impact of cuts to NOAA staff

The impacts of the cuts at NOAA, say experts and agency employees who
spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal by the Trump
administration, could be profound. The agency has around 12,000
employees that work on a broad range of topics, from conditions in the
upper atmosphere to fish in the depths of the ocean.

NOAA monitors and forecasts the country\'s weather and hurricanes,
manages oceanic fisheries, protects coastal resources and creates and
updates maritime maps critical to global shipping. TV meteorologists
rely on NOAA data for local forecasting, as does the weather report many
Americans read on their phones. [**[Disruptions in]{.mark} NOAA\'s
[employee base could]{.mark}, among other outcomes, [result in less
accurate weather forecasts]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} experts warn, or delays
in updating maritime maps key to safe passage within the U.S.\'s oceanic
waters]{.underline}.

\"Breaking up, defunding, or reducing NOAA\'s highly integrated
workforce will severely impact our nation\'s economy,\" five of NOAA\'s
former administrators said in an open letter to Congress and the
American public. \"[It will also make it m**ore difficult to receive
weather forecasts**, be assured of the safety of seafood, and ensure the
timely delivery of purchases from overseas, which are delivered
primarily through our nation\'s ports.\"]{.underline}

Timothy Gallaudet, a former Navy officer and oceanographer who served as
acting administrator of NOAA during the first Trump administration,
warned that weakening NOAA could \"have national security and economic
impacts that are really seemingly contradicting the administration\'s
priorities now.\" The risks include disruptions to weather operations,
marine shipping safety, and military activities.

NOAA also houses and supports cutting-edge climate science research. NPR
reported previously that several of Trump\'s January executive orders
focused on cutting or slashing climate programs specifically. NOAA
officials received a list of terms related to those executive orders and
were instructed to review related grants and programs for potential
cuts.

\"We all earned our positions,\" says one former employee who worked in
fisheries policy within the National Marine Fisheries Service, one of
NOAA\'s offices. They asked to speak anonymously out of fear of
retribution from the Trump administration. \"It\'s so disheartening. And
**[[it\'s really reducing the intellectual and regulatory capabilities
of the agency.\"]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Another NOAA employee, who asked not to be named because of concerns
about [[jeopardizing future]{.mark} employment
opportunities,]{.underline} fretted that the move could stunt the
agency\'s work for years to come. \"[[**It\'s an absolute gutting of
young talent**,]{.mark}\" they say.]{.underline}

How could this affect NOAA operations?

NOAA\'s most widely known offices include the National Weather Service
and the National Hurricane Center. NWS produces weather forecasts and
relies on a vast network of data collected from locations across the
country. [That data is fed into the models that create the weather
forecasts, which are used daily by millions of Americans, as well as a
vast number of industries, including shipping and aviation. Those
weather models need active care and monitoring by
scientists.]{.underline}

[[**Even a small reduction** in the amount or quality of data]{.mark}
coming in for the weather models [**can impact** weather prediction
**accuracy**]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, some small percentage of
weather observations are provided by commercial aircraft; during the
first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic, when flight activity dropped
precipitously, [some scientists teased out a decrease in weather model
accuracy]{.underline} (though others found a smaller impact).

NOAA scientists also monitor global climate patterns that have major
impacts on the U.S., like the seasonal El Niño and La Niña, which can
determine whether parts of the country see droughts or floods. The
agency\'s long-running rainfall records are used by engineers around the
country, who are required to design roads, bridges and other
infrastructure to withstand flooding.

The agency also operates the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations,
which manages a fleet of scientific and survey ships, along with highly
specialized research airplanes. Those ships and planes provide key data
for climate, weather, fisheries, underwater mapping, and more.

An employee at NOAA, who asked not to be named for fear of retribution,
said such cuts would have a direct impact on the capabilities of the
office to carry out its crucial coastal mapping duties. Those include
planned, upcoming projects like creating new ocean floor maps in the
Arctic, where climate change is causing sea ice to retreat and opening
up new areas for global maritime travel that are poorly charted.

The U.S. currently boasts some of the most sustainable oceanic fisheries
in the world, says Janet Coit, who led NOAA\'s National Marine Fisheries
Service, or NOAA Fisheries, under the Biden administration. The
office\'s ability to refine that management could suffer, she says.
Cuts, Coit says, could \"hollow the ability of NOAA Fisheries. It raises
the question, she says: \"How do you support the growth of our seafood
sector while simultaneously eviscerating the agency that\'s responsible
for sustainable management and many other aspects of supporting our
seafood sector?\"

[It will take years to understand the full scope of the impacts of such
staff cuts, says Rick Spinrad, NOAA administrator during the Biden
administration]{.underline}. NOAA is currently one of the premier
science agencies in the world, he says, and historically, leaders have
been \"able to pick and choose the best and the brightest.\" But \"[[if
you lose the intellectual capital, it\'s going to take decades to get
that back]{.mark},\" Spinrad says.]{.underline}

### UQ\-\--1AR

#### NOAA is [hanging]{.underline} by a [thread]{.underline}\-\--the [agency]{.underline} still [retains]{.underline} some of their [capabilities]{.underline}.

raj

The [[proposal]{.underline}]{.mark} also aims to [[**slim down**
NOAA]{.underline}]{.mark}\'s [[investment in]{.underline}]{.mark} some
of its premier [[satellite]{.underline}]{.mark} technology, called
geostationary satellites, [[by **44%**]{.underline}]{.mark} compared to
current levels. The agency currently has five in orbit, which provide
much of the data critical for weather forecasts, as well as weather and
climate research and coastal security. The agency was in the process of
developing the next generation of its satellites, which would have
included several new instruments; the next was scheduled to go into
orbit in 2032. The cuts to the program will jeopardize that plan and
hamper the progression of key science, according to NOAA officials
familiar with the program who were not authorized to speak publicly.

The budget for the National Weather Service would remain intact.

The overall impacts of the cuts would ripple into Americans\' lives,
says Rep, Zoe Lofgren of California, the top Democrat on the House
Science, Space, and Technology Committee. \"What NOAA does is crucial to
the lifesaving weather research and services that it provides to the
American people,\" she says. \"This [[budget will leave NOAA **hollowed
out**]{.underline}]{.mark} and unable to perform its life-saving work.\"
The budget draft has not yet been finalized and could change after
review.

White House Office of Management and Budget spokesperson Alexandra
McCandless wrote in an email that \"[[no final funding decisions have
been made]{.underline}]{.mark}.\" The U.S. Department of Commerce
didn\'t immediately respond to NPR\'s request for comment.

Project 2025 provided a preview

Many of the proposed changes echo concepts outlined in Project 2025, the
conservative policy blueprint organized by the Washington, DC-based
Heritage Foundation think tank, a document the Trump administration has
followed closely in recent months.

[[Project 2025 calls for NOAA to]{.underline}]{.mark}
\"[[be]{.underline}]{.mark} broken up and
**[[downsized]{.underline}]{.mark}**,\" keeping the pieces that many
Americans are familiar with, like the National Weather Service, and
dismantling many of NOAA\'s other offices. The proposed moves follow
that rubric, such as shifting the Fisheries Service to another agency.

It also called the agency part of \"the main drivers of the climate
change alarm industry\" and laid out ways NOAA\'s climate science
research could be curtailed, some of which have been proposed in the
budget document.

Decades of research by thousands of scientists in the U.S. and
internationally, have linked rising atmospheric carbon dioxide with a
warming Earth. Human activities, like burning coal, gas and other fossil
fuels, are the primary cause of rising greenhouse gas concentrations in
the atmosphere.

Other disruptions at the agency

Earlier this week, hundreds of NOAA employees who had been fired in
February, then re-hired under a court order, were once again fired. The
most recent firings occurred after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the
Trump administration could move forward with firing those probationary
orders, at least for now.

Cuts to probationary staff, in tandem with the proposed slashing of the
research and operations budgets, could hobble the agency\'s ability to
keep Americans safe, says Andy Hazelton, a hurricane expert who was
among those re-fired this week. \"[[NOAA was already **stretched
thin**]{.underline}]{.mark} and understaffed,\" he says.
\"[[It\'s]{.underline}]{.mark} going to go from stretched thin to
**[[decimated]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\"

NOAA provides most of the raw data and the models that predict
hurricanes, and the hurricane forecasts many Americans see on their
phones or TVs are created by the agency. Hazelton says reducing the
research and observation capabilities of the agency could regress
hurricane forecasting capability by the equivalent of decades.

The cuts to the research wing, OAR, says former NOAA Deputy
Undersecretary Mary Glackin, who served over several administrations,
would \"decimate the laboratory systems and the relationship that we
have with universities,\" who work in partnership with the agency on
many of its climate, weather, and other research projects. The proposed
changes would be \"monumental,\" she says.

NOAA provides much of the raw data required for weather forecasts via a
wide array of data-collection tools, from satellites to ocean buoys to
weather balloons. And its scientists run models that turn that data into
useful information, like those short-term weather forecasts, seasonal
outlooks and long-term looks at how climate change is affecting Earth.

The agency also includes offices that manage the billions of dollars of
U.S. fishery resources, like tuna, cod, scallops and crab. Its
scientists figure out how many fish can be caught in order to sustain
fish populations in the long term, a task legally required by law.
Interruptions to fisheries operations have resulted in the past in
delays in season opening or lower annual quotas fishermen are allowed to
catch.

raj

Staff reductions, budget cuts and other changes made by the
administration since January have already created holes at the National
Weather Service, which forecasts and warns of dangerous weather.

Mr. [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}'s [[budget
proposal]{.underline}]{.mark} for the next fiscal year would
[[close]{.underline}]{.mark} 10 [[laboratories run
by]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[N]{.underline}]{.mark}ational
[[O]{.underline}]{.mark}ceanic and [[A]{.underline}]{.mark}tmospheric
[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}dministration [[that
research]{.underline}]{.mark} the ways a [[warming]{.underline}]{.mark}
planet is changing weather, [[among]{.underline}]{.mark} other things.
That work is essential to more [[**accurately** predicting
**life-threatening hazards**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Among the shuttered
labs would be one in Miami that sends teams of "hurricane hunters" to
fly into storms to collect critical data. The proposed budget would also
[[make major cuts to]{.mark}]{.underline} a federal
[[program]{.underline}]{.mark} that uses river gauges [[to **predict**
floods]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The president is also envisioning a dramatically scaled-down Federal
Emergency Management Agency that would shift the costs of disaster
response and recovery from the federal government to the states. The
administration has already revoked \$3.6 billion in grants from FEMA to
hundreds of communities around the country, which were to be used to
help these areas protect against hurricanes, wildfires and other
catastrophes. About 10 percent of the agency's staff members have left
since January, including senior leaders with decades of experience, and
another 20 percent are expected to be gone by the end of this year.

The White House and agency leaders say they are making much-needed
changes to bloated bureaucracies that no longer serve the American
public well.

FEMA, for one, "has been slow to respond at the federal level. It's even
been slower to get the resources to Americans in crisis," Kristi Noem,
the homeland security secretary, said last week at a meeting convened by
the president to recommend changes to the agency. "That is why this
entire agency needs to be eliminated as it exists today and remade into
a responsive agency. We owe it to all the American people to deliver the
most efficient and the most effective disaster response."

National security and disaster management experts agreed that FEMA ---
or any federal agency --- could be improved but they said the chaotic
changes the Trump administration is making to FEMA, as well as other
parts of the government, are harmful.

The federal government's retrenchment arrives at a time when climate
change is making extreme weather more frequent and severe. Last year,
the United States experienced 27 disasters that cost more than \$1
billion each.

"The Trump administration is leaving communities naked, without the
necessary tools that could help them assess risks or reduce those
risks," said Alice C. Hill, who worked on climate resilience and
security issues for the National Security Council during the Obama
administration and who is now a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign
Relations.

"We know preparedness saves lives," Ms. Hill said. "When you make cuts
to the Weather Service, that is undermining forecasts. When you cut the
collection of data, satellites, all of that will degrade the accuracy of
forecasts. And even with a strong forecast, it's meaningless unless the
people who need to hear it, hear it."

A 'Generational Loss' for Forecasting

For months, experts have warned that [cuts to]{.underline} the National
Weather Service, part of [NOAA]{.underline}, could
**[endanger]{.underline}** local [communities]{.underline}. Those fears
have grown since the deadly flash floods in Central Texas earlier this
month.

By all accounts, the Weather Service issued the appropriate warnings for
the region that was inundated by the Guadalupe River on July 4.

But the agency had to move employees from other offices to temporarily
staff the San Antonio office that handled the flood warnings, and the
office lacked a warning coordination meteorologist, whose job it is to
communicate with local emergency managers to plan for floods, including
when and how to warn residents and help them evacuate. The office's
warning coordination meteorologist had left on April 30, after taking
the early retirement package the Trump administration has offered to
reduce the number of federal employees.

Since Mr. Trump took office, [the]{.underline} Weather
[Service]{.underline} has [shed]{.underline} about [**600**
jobs]{.underline} from its work force of roughly 4,200 people. They are
part of a greater exodus of nearly [**2,000 employees** from
NOAA]{.underline}. Nearly half of the Weather Service's 122 forecast
offices had lost at least 20 percent of their staff as of April. Thirty
offices were lacking their most experienced official, known as the
meteorologist-in-charge, as of May.

"When that position is vacant, it does have consequences because that is
the primary person who is briefing elected officials and emergency
managers," said Brian LaMarre, who retired at the end of April as the
meteorologist-in-charge of the Weather Service forecast office in Tampa,
Fla.

Some forecast [[offices]{.underline}]{.mark} are no longer staffed
overnight, and others have been [[launching **fewer** weather
balloons]{.underline}]{.mark}, which send data to feed forecasts. The
Weather Service has said it is [[preparing for **"degraded
operations."**]{.underline}]{.mark}

The president is preparing to deal another blow to weather forecasting
in his spending plan for next year, which would cut funding for NOAA by
another \$2 billion, or 27 percent. [[On]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[chopping block]{.underline}]{.mark}** would
[[be]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[agency's]{.underline}]{.mark} entire
[[scientific research division]{.underline}]{.mark}, one of the world's
premier weather and climate research centers,
**[[preventing]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [[**creation** of
new]{.underline}]{.mark} weather [[forecasting
technologies]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Ten laboratories across the country are also slated to be closed,
including the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Okla. Founded
in 1964, the lab created a tool to improve the accuracy of flash flood
forecasts across the country --- the same tool that correctly predicted
the Guadalupe River's rise after the floods hit Central Texas.

Mr. Trump also wants to shutter the Atlantic Oceanographic and

When I served as chief of staff for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) from 2001 to 2008, the [U.S. experienced an
average of seven billion-dollar weather and climate disasters per
year.]{.underline} Now, the [annual average has swelled to 20 over the
past five years]{.underline}, including a record 28 disasters last year.
In the past decade, the average annual cost of these disasters has
skyrocketed from \$64 billion to \$121 billion, [and it's only expected
to climb higher according to the federal government's latest National
Climate Assessment.]{.underline}

[The [financial toll]{.mark} would be much greater if it weren't for
weather forecasts issued or [enabled by NOAA]{.mark}, which [already
save billions of dollars annually and countless lives. However, **the

system budget during the same period. Another analysis estimates a value
of \$9 for every \$1 spent by federal agencies on weather forecasting
and research, which also enables a thriving private weather sector.

[These [large returns]{.mark} on investment are [due to advances]{.mark}
in weather forecasting [infrastructure]{.mark}, research [and

After [[storing carbon dioxide in frozen soil for
millennia]{.underline}]{.mark}, the Arctic [tund[ra is being transformed
by frequent wildfire]{.mark}s into an overall source of carbon to the
atmosphere, which is already absorbing record levels of heat-trapping
fossil fuel pollution.]{.underline}

The [transition of the Arctic tundra from a carbon sink to a carbon
source is one of the dramatic changes in the Arctic that are documented
in NOAA's 2024 Arctic Report Card]{.underline}. Climatic shifts are
forcing plants, wildlife and the people that depend on them to rapidly
adapt to a warmer, wetter and less certain world.

"[[Our observations now show that the Arctic tundra]{.mark}, which is
[experiencing warming and increased wildfire]{.mark}, is now [emitting
more carbon that it stores]{.mark}, which will worsen climate change
impacts]{.underline}," said NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad, Ph.D. "This
is yet one more sign, predicted by scientists, of the consequences of
inadequately reducing fossil fuel pollution."

New research in the 2024 Arctic Report Card, contributed by 97
scientists from 11 countries, reveals record-setting observations that
underlie ongoing changes emerging in the Arctic, which covers the lands
and seas of the north polar region. They include:

Continuing high air temperatures and wildfires.

Declines of large inland caribou herds.

Increasing precipitation, including rain-on-snow events that coat the
landscape in an icy shell, making travel difficult for people and
foraging challenging for wildlife.

"This year's report demonstrates the urgent need for adaptation as
climate conditions quickly change," said Twila Moon, lead editor of the
Arctic Report Card and deputy lead scientist at the National Snow and

Autumn 2023 and summer 2024 were especially warm across the Arctic, with

In September 2024, the extent of Arctic sea ice, which has a profound
influence on the polar environment, was the sixth-lowest in the 45-year
satellite record.

All 18 of the lowest September minimum ice extents have occurred in the
last 18 years.

Arctic Ocean regions that were ice-free in August have been warming at a
rate of 0.5 degrees F (0.3 degrees C) per decade since 1982.

In most of the shallow seas that ring the Arctic Ocean, August mean sea
surface temperatures were 3.6--7.2 degrees F (2--4 degrees C) warmer
than 1991-2020 averages, while the Chukchi Sea were 1.8--7.2 degrees F
(1--4 degrees C) cooler than average.

Plankton blooms --- the base of the marine food chain --- continue to
increase in all Arctic regions, except for the Pacific Arctic,
throughout the observational record of 2003--2024. However, in 2024,
lower-than-average values were dominant across much of the Arctic.

Ice seal populations remain healthy in the Pacific Arctic, though their
diets are shifting from Arctic cod to saffron cod with warming waters.

On land

[When including the impact of increased wildfire activity, the Arctic
tundra region has shifted from storing carbon in the soil to becoming a

Arctic migratory tundra caribou populations have declined by 65% over
the last 2-3 decades. Though the generally smaller coastal herds of the
western Arctic have seen some recovery over roughly the last decade,
large inland caribou herds are continuing a long-term decline or remain
at the lowest populations noted by Indigenous elders.

### CDR Fails\-\--2AC

#### CDR isn't what it's glorified to be.

editor with more than 20 years of experience writing and editing print
and online content; What's the problem with carbon removal technology?;

DBSTM\]

Each method has pros and cons. As the IPCC has stated, "There are a
number of CDR methods, each with different potentials for achieving
negative emissions, as well as different associated costs and side
effects. They are also at differing levels of development, with some
more conceptual than others." [**[These]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nologies
[have their own environmental impacts]{.mark} and potential risks** to
people in surrounding communities]{.underline}. Direct air capture plant
in Squamish, B.C. Photo: Stephen Hui, Pembina Institute "CDR solutions
are key in the transition to a decarbonized future because they can help
hard-to-decarbonize sectors address unavoidable emissions," the Center
for Climate and Energy Solutions has noted. It adds, "Importantly,
[**[CDR solutions are not a substitute]{.mark} for emissions
reductions**, which remain an urgent priority]{.underline}." Many [CDR
technologies are **[nascent and borderline theoretical]{.mark}**,
requiring **[incredible R&D investment to reach the necessary
cost]{.mark}** and scale to affect global warming.]{.underline} 5
[**li[mitations and drawbacks]{.mark}** [of carbon removal]{.mark}
Although carbon removal technologies are important to reach net-zero,
cutting emissions across all sectors is paramount]{.underline}. And
questions remain about these solutions' technical and financial
viability. [**[Many carbon removal technologies are expensive and
haven't been tested at scale]{.mark}.**]{.underline} According to the
IPCC, "[[Upscaling the deployment]{.mark} of CDR depends on developing
effective approaches to [address feasibility and sustainability
constraints]{.mark}, especially at large scales.]{.underline}" A
life-cycle analysis (LCA) is often used to assess a product's
environmental impact through its entire life cycle. And it's one way CDR
technologies have been evaluated. Why [**[we shouldn't rely on carbon
removal technologies anytime soon]{.mark}**]{.underline} In theory,
carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies are the answer to many climate
and emissions problems. But to make a dent in global warming, there's a
long way to go. • Pulls attention from mitigation: If companies feel
they can make a problem go away---in this case, remove carbon rather
than bring down their emissions footprint---they will, and it could
preclude a systemic shift toward decarbonization. • Viability:
Tech-based carbon removal solutions are incredibly costly, especially at
the magnitude required to remove carbon at scale. • [Energy required:
[**The amount of energy required** for things like direct air capture
**is staggering**]{.mark}, and even if the tech uses renewable energy,
**it [siphons that clean energy away]{.mark} from more urgent
applications**]{.underline}. One review of life-cycle analysis studies
of CDR technologies found that "LCA is often applied in inconsistent,
misleading, and ambiguous ways." So these assessments may paint an
overly rosy picture of some CDR technologies. The study's authors noted
"most CDR technologies are not sufficiently examined regarding their
overall environmental performance," including how "negative emissions"
(and negative emissions technologies) are quantified. 1. Distracts from
cutting emissions The LCA study authors wrote that "relying on [CDR
technologies [could **result in a moral hazard**]{.mark}**,** since
**[policy-makers could use CDR technologies as a safeguard to
postpone]{.mark} climate [mitigation measures]{.mark}."**]{.underline}
For companies, [the danger is that [th**ey will prioritize carbon
removal rather than deeper operational change and reducing
emissions**]{.mark}.]{.underline} 2. Feasibility at scale Take, for
example, DAC. 18 DAC plants are operating worldwide, according to a
September 2022 International Energy Agency (IEA) report. All are small
in scale: They capture just 10,000 MT CO2 per year---the equivalent of a
pithy 11 million pounds of burned coal. This may seem like a lot but,
"In the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, direct air capture is
scaled up to capture almost 60 \[million\] MT CO2/year by 2030," the
report says. That's nearly a 600-fold increase in the amount of carbon
over eight years, requiring a staggering amount of new carbon removal
companies to spring up quickly. In comparison, global CO2 emissions from
energy combustion and industrial processes rose to a record high, 36.3
gigatons (or 36,300 million MT) in 2021. 3. Cost An Environmental
Defense Fund report identifies direct air capture as a promising
technology. "We're starting to see some really fast-paced movement in
the direct air capture space and some promising approaches there. But
the problem is, even direct air capture is really, really costly at the
moment," says Jordan Faires, manager of EDF+Biz Net Zero. The cost is
estimated at between \$125 and \$335 per metric ton of carbon for a
large-scale plant, according to an International Energy Agency report.
4. Land, water, and energy required Some technologies are energy
intensive and need substantial land and water to operate, which may be
problematic in water-scarce areas. [**[If resources go to these
technologies]{.mark}**, to the detriment of communities that often bear
the brunt of environmental harms, **[environmental injustices may
result]{.mark}**]{.underline}. DAC "facilities use a very high amount of
energy, and we'll need that renewable energy to power all sorts of
things in a net-zero economy, so the question kind of becomes: To what
extent can we divert renewable energy to these direct air capture
facilities versus using that to power clean cars, clean homes?" Faires
says. The Climate Justice Alliance has criticized DAC, calling it "an
unproven technology that allows fossil fuel extraction and use to
continue, resulting in ongoing harm to frontline communities." 5.

### CDR Fails\-\--1AR

For some scientists, they are the inevitable next stage of staving off
the existential threat of climate chaos. For others, they should not
even be talked about. [Carbon dioxide removal ([CDR]{.mark})
technologies]{.underline}, which provide a means of sucking carbon out
of the atmosphere, are one of the hottest areas of climate research, but
also the most [[controversial]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The debate over
whether and how to develop CDR has been ignited by the release last
month of the final section of the comprehensive review of climate
science by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC).]{.underline} The report found that ways of capturing and storing
carbon dioxide, though expensive, might play a role in trying to keep
global temperatures within safe bounds. [But [scientists and
policymakers are divided]{.mark}]{.underline}. Some say the technology
must be the immediate priority for research. Others urge caution, and
warn against putting faith in untested technology before we have even
fully deployed the reliable low-carbon technologies, such as renewable
energy, that we already have. David King is working with Cambridge
University's department of engineering to try to find ways of refreezing
the Arctic Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty Images John Kerry, the US special
presidential envoy for climate, talked of his concerns. "Some scientists
suggest that it's possible there could be an overshoot \[of global
temperatures, beyond the limit of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels that
governments are targeting\] and you could clawback, so to speak; you
have technologies and other things that allow you to come back. "The
danger with that, which alarms me the most and motivates me the most, is
that according to the science, and the best scientists in the world, we
may be at or past several tipping points that they have been warning us
about for some time," he said. "That's the danger, the irreversibility."
The former UK government chief scientific adviser Sir David King
strenuously disagrees. He believes CDR of many kinds will be needed,
along with the means to "repair" the climate, such as by refreezing the
ice caps, because the world is almost certain to overshoot the global
target limit of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. "We are already at
1.35C above pre-industrial levels today," he said. "We are already
experiencing massive warming in the Arctic, where it's more than 3C
above the pre-industrial average." A rash of new technology startups
bears witness to the potential business opportunity that many companies
and investors see in CDR. These fledgling companies are exploring
everything from "scrubbers" that chemically remove carbon dioxide from
the air, to "biochar", which creates fertiliser from burning wood waste
without oxygen, and carbon capture and storage (CCS) by which carbon
dioxide is liquefied and pumped into underground geological formations.
They have taken the IPCC report as a spur to investment, and a stamp of
approval. "Growing carbon removal to be in line with the IPCC requires a
massive scale-up in the next decade. Startups are meeting this climate
challenge by developing a suite of approaches that can make a gigaton
impact," said Tania Timmermann, the chief technology officer of Andes, a
company that plans to use micro-organisms to sequester carbon in soil.
Ben Rubin, the executive director of the Carbon Business Council, which
represents several CDR specialists, said: "The IPCC report makes clear
that the window of opportunity is closing quickly, highlighting the
urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing emissions is
crucial but not enough: the report affirms that gigatonnes of carbon
removal are required to help restore the climate," he said. "Innovators
are actively working to meet this climate challenge, by finding
cost-effective and responsible ways to deploy carbon removal." But the
key section of the IPCC report, which ignited the controversy, was
fiercely fought over by scientists and governments up until the last
moments before the document was finalised. The handful of mentions of
CDR in the final 36-page summary for policymakers -- which distils the
key messages and is compiled by scientists alongside government
representatives from any UN member that wants to take part -- were only
inserted after hours of desperate wrangling. Saudi Arabia and other
oil-producing countries were most insistent that CDR and CCS should be
included and emphasised. In the end, nine references to CDR were left in
the summary, and several more to CCS. "Saudi Arabia brought 10 very
experienced negotiators," said one person. "They tried to take out
references to renewable energy and tried to insist that references to
carbon capture should be in there instead of, or at least as well as,
renewables." A CCS facility in Alberta, Canada. Photograph: Todd
Korol/Reuters [But [many scientists]{.mark}, campaigners and green
experts [are unhappy with the references]{.mark}. They fear that giving
the impression there are viable options for [removing carbon dioxide
might engender a false sense of security.]{.mark} Most [CDR
tech]{.mark}nologies are [unproven]{.mark}, are likely to be [limited in
scope]{.mark}, [take years]{.mark} to develop and will [cost large
amounts of money]{.mark}.]{.underline} Lili Fuhr, the director of the
climate and energy programme at the Center for International
Environmental Law, said: "We need to challenge the idea that we have to
do less now, because we can do more later, with technofixes. This is a
dangerous idea." Friederike Otto, a lead author of the IPCC, and senior
lecturer at the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London, said:
"[My feeling about CDR is that [we should pretend it is not an
option]{.mark}. We should [act as if CDR will never be
achievable]{.mark}. We [do not have]{.mark} a [tech]{.mark}nology at the
moment that works at scale ... so we should [make our policies as if CDR
is not an option]{.mark}]{.underline}." [She said [pursuing CDR could be
a dangerous distraction]{.mark}, and questioned whether it was a good
idea to spend money on technologies that offered highly uncertain future
benefits, when viable ways of reducing emissions now were not being
deployed fast enough.]{.underline} "CDR has already been used as an
excuse to dither and delay," she said.

#### The tech for CDR is uncertain and literally impossible to get going.

Institute\'s Environment and Resources program; Risks of relying on
uncertain carbon dioxide removal in climate policy;
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61106-4; DBSTM\]

There are [many **potential [CDR]{.mark} technologies with varying costs
and levels of experience**]{.underline}. The two novel technologies
(i.e., not including conventional land use change and forestry9) that
are most widely represented in models are bioenergy with carbon capture
and storage (BECCS) and, more recently, direct air carbon capture and
storage (DACCS), although interest in other technologies is
growing10,11. BECCS produces useful energy from biomass and captures the
resulting CO2 emissions12. DACCS uses chemical processes to capture CO2
from ambient air13. The captured CO2 can then be durably stored (e.g.,
in underground geologic formations). Novel CDR technologies including
BECCS and especially DACCS have seen growing interest from policymakers
and the private sector4,14. However, [these **[tech]{.mark}nologies are
in the early stages of adoption**, and thus their future role in the
global economy is **[highly uncertain]{.mark}15**]{.underline},16.

[A **[variety of factors may limit]{.mark}** the build-out of
**[CDR]{.mark}** at a climate-relevant scale]{.underline}. Given their
novelty, [[**costs** of CDR]{.mark} approaches such as BECCS and DACCS
[are **highly uncertain**]{.mark}]{.underline}**9**,17 but generally
exceed the \$100/tCO2 target recommended for economical deployment18,19.
At scale, [CDR **m[ay also place pressure on global]{.mark} land and
water [systems and require]{.mark} large [energy and material
inputs]{.mark}**20]{.underline},21,22. The risks of large-scale BECCS
and other land-based CDR approaches have been particularly emphasized
given their potential to increase food and water scarcity23.
[Additionally, **[large-scale geologic]{.mark}** CO2
**[storage]{.mark}**, while technically feasible24,25, may be
**[socially and politically infeasible]{.mark}26**]{.underline},27. More
broadly, social and political constraints may limit the scale-up of CDR
and can vary depending on the particular CDR method and community needs
and perspectives28,29. [[Some]{.mark} have also [rai**sed concerns about
whether planning for CDR presents a moral hazard**]{.mark} **and [risks
deterring other climate action]{.mark}**]{.underline}30,31,32. Even if
rapid scale-up is feasible, [[CDR may have **negative side effects**
]{.mark}**that make high CDR futures less desirable**]{.underline}17,33.

#### CDR sustains the fossil fuel industry and its effectiveness in mitigation is unproven 

Alice **Hill 24**, Hill serves as the David M. Rubinstein senior fellow
for energy and the environment at the Council on Foreign Relations. She
previously served as a fellow at Stanford University\'s Hoover
Institution.3/29/24, "Carbon dioxide removal: can it be effective?",
https://www.cfr.org/expert-brief/carbon-dioxide-removal-can-it-be-effective
//maeve

[[Advocates for]{.mark} rapid [reduction of fossil fuels]{.mark} have
[expressed concern that CDR efforts could create a moral hazard]{.mark}
by [lowering ambition to cut]{.mark} oil and gas
[consumption]{.mark}]{.underline}. The head of Occidental Petroleum,
Vicki Hollub, lent credence to this argument when she suggested [that
[implementing DAC would preserve the oil industry and give]{.mark} oil
[producers a license to]{.mark} continue to
[operate]{.mark}]{.underline}. Occidental plans to build around 100 DAC
plants to help its oil production reach net-zero.

[[Concern has also arisen that companies and governments could expand
CDR's applications beyond]{.mark} addressing emissions from
[hard-to-abate sectors]{.mark}. The **[IPCC has cautioned that
CDR should not substitute]{.mark}** \[PDF\] **[for steep reductions in
carbon emissions]{.mark}**, emphasizing that reducing the amount of
carbon produced and emitted is the main way to hold warming to 1.5°C**[.
It envisioned a lesser role for large-scale CDR
tech]{.mark}**nology]{.underline} such as DAC, given that the
technology's success at scale remains to be seen, **[[making reliance on
it a "major risk]{.underline}]{.mark}**." The International Energy
Agency has also recognized the need for CDR, but it has warned
against [[too heavy a dependence on tech]{.mark}nologies [that are
"expensive and unproven]{.mark}."]{.underline}

Critics argue that [[CDR is too]{.mark} expensive and [energy-intensive
to serve as a viable alternative to rapidly reduce fossil
fuels]{.mark}]{.underline}. The world's first large-scale DAC facility,
located in Iceland, can capture only about four thousand tons of carbon
annually, a minute share of global emissions. Questions also abound as
to whether CDR technology can scale quickly enough at a cheap enough
price to avert significant heating. [[Some argue that money going to CDR
would be better spent on keeping]{.mark} more [emissions out of the
atmosphere in the first place]{.mark} by, for example,
increasing investment in renewable energies such as solar and wind
power. ]{.underline}

#### Carbon Dioxide removal is overhyped, climate scientists vote no

James **Kerry 25**, Kerry is a senior marine and climate scientist at

//maeve

[[Based on current decarbonisation efforts]{.underline}]{.mark}, Dr
Brunner is right to say that "[[the amount of CO2 we will need to remove
is staggering]{.underline}]{.mark}" but he is wrong to suggest that
carbon removal technologies like direct air capture (DAC), which filters
CO2 from the air, can meet this need. To date, [[the DAC industry has
sequestered around 10,000 tonnes of CO2]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is
**[[equivalent to about nine seconds' worth of annual global
emissions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, less time than it takes to read this
sentence. [[Reaching climate relevant scales of removals would mean
scaling up the industry]{.underline}]{.mark}, in a matter of decades,
[[by orders of magnitude that are unprecedented in industrial
history.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[DAC also faces some]{.mark} fundamental**[, inescapable headwinds that
will not simply be resolved by trial and error]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
In the atmosphere, [[CO2 still accounts for a very small
fraction]{.mark} meaning [vast amounts of air must be
processed]{.mark}.]{.underline} This consumes a lot of energy, which
itself must be fossil fuel free for the process to make any climate
sense. [And [DAC alone does not]{.mark} actually [remove CO2]{.mark};
the [captured gas must still be compressed, transported and
injected]{.mark} underground. [This second phase has so far also proved
underwhelming]{.mark} [and fraught with risks]{.mark}, ranging from
potential leakage to induced seismic activity, including
earthquakes]{.underline}.

#### Carbon removal success is unfeasible

//maeve

U.N. [[estimates of the amount of carbon that humans can remove from the
atmosphere **are deeply unrealistic**, scientists
warn]{.underline}]{.mark}. A new paper offers more plausible carbon
removal targets.

The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates the world
could draw down 11.3 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide yearly by
planting fast-growing crops, burning those crops to generate power, and
then capturing the resulting emissions. The world could scrub an
additional 10.1 billion metric tons from the atmosphere each year by
cultivating forests. But [[the land needed for new farmland and
forest]{.mark} in these scenarios [would cover an area three times the
size of China.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"[[It is obvious that this is by no means
feasible,"]{.underline}]{.mark} said Felix Creutzig, a researcher at
Technical University of Berlin and coauthor of the new paper. Devoting
such a vast area to carbon removal would mean destroying wilderness,
encroaching on needed farmland, and trampling Indigenous land rights.
[By [putting forward these unrealistic estimates,]{.mark}]{.underline}
he said, the U.N. [[is encouraging politicians to do too little to cut
emissions]{.underline}]{.mark} "and to promise great things in terms of
carbon removal instead."

The new paper, published in Science, estimates [[the world could
sustainably remove**, at most,** 2.9 billion]{.underline}]{.mark} metric
[[tons of carbon dioxide]{.underline}]{.mark} annually by capturing
emissions from burning crops and 3.8 billion tons annually from growing
forest.

While the U.N. figures reflect what is technically possible, "[[The real
scope of possibilities is definitely smaller]{.underline}]{.mark},"
Creutzig said.

[A **generation** of **scientific** talent is at the **brink** of being

The **[gold standard peer-reviewed process]{.underline}** used by the

[**undermined** by the chaotic cuts to staff]{.underline},
[programs]{.underline} and grants, and by meddling by the so-called
department of government efficiency (Doge), [according to
**multiple**]{.underline} current and former [NSF employees]{.underline}
who spoke with the Guardian.

The scientists warn that Trump's assault on diversity in science is

it's like rolling the dice, because a Doge person has the final say,"
said one current program officer. "There has never in the history of NSF

do."

Another program officer said: "The exact details of the extra step is

### Impact\-\--Scientific Leadership\-\--2NC

[Should a]{.underline} massive [**exodus** of scientists
occur]{.underline}, [the **long-term consequences**]{.underline} for the
United States could [be **severe** and **far-reaching**]{.underline}.
These include a potential [decline in U.S. scientific
**leadership**]{.underline} across numerous fields, particularly [in
emerging areas]{.underline} like quantum computing, advanced materials
science, and biotechnology where global competition is already intense.
This leadership [**vacuum** could **trigger** a **downward
spiral**]{.underline} as reduced collaboration opportunities make the
U.S. less attractive to top talent.

The innovation ecosystem that underpins economic [**competitiveness**
and national **security** would face **significant**
disruption]{.underline}. Patent filings could decrease, startup
formation might slow, and critical defense and intelligence
technological advantages could erode. The economic impact would extend
beyond direct R&D sectors to affect manufacturing, healthcare,
agriculture, and numerous other industries dependent on scientific
advancement.

Furthermore, [the nation would face a **drastically** reduced capacity
to **address** critical **national** and global **challenges** such as
**climate change**]{.underline} (including adaptation strategies and
mitigation technologies), [**pandemic** preparedness]{.underline} (as
demonstrated by COVID-19), **[energy security]{.underline}**, **[food
systems resilience]{.underline}**, [and **emerging** health
threats]{.underline} like antimicrobial resistance. [These
capabilities]{.underline}, once diminished, [cannot be **rapidly**
reconstructed]{.underline}.

[Rebuilding]{.underline} lost [**scientific capacity** and
**international reputation** is a **slow** and **costly**
endeavor]{.underline} that typically takes decades rather than years, as
seen in historical examples where scientific communities were disrupted.

[The concept of a]{.underline} \"**[tipping point]{.underline}**\" [is
crucial]{.underline} in this context. While the U.S. scientific
ecosystem is robust and can absorb some shocks, a sustained period of
policies perceived as hostile to science and scientists could
[push]{.underline} it [**past** a **threshold** where recovery becomes
**exceptionally difficult** and lengthy]{.underline}. This tipping point
analysis applies to both individual fields and the broader scientific
enterprise.

[The]{.underline} cumulative and [**synergistic effects** of the
**proposed** policies create **multiple**]{.underline}, [**sustained
shocks** to the system]{.underline}. [If enough]{.underline} senior
[**talent** departs]{.underline} ([particularly **research
leaders**]{.underline} who bring large teams and substantial funding),
[if research programs **collapse** due to **defunding**]{.underline} or
loss of personnel, [if international collaborations
**falter**]{.underline}, and if the pipeline of new talent (both
domestic and international) dries up, [the system\'s ability to
**self-repair**]{.underline} and innovate [is **fundamentally
compromised**]{.underline}.

#### That causes a [negative]{.underline} feedback loop. Minority groups are [disproportionally]{.underline} affected.

[A **less diverse** scientific workforce]{.underline} is generally
[understood to be **less innovative**]{.underline}, as varied
perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds bring a wider range of
questions, methodologies, and solutions to scientific problems.

Historical examples demonstrate that [**breakthrough** innovations often
emerge from **unexpected sources** and diverse teams]{.underline}.
Research shows that papers with ethnically diverse authors receive more
citations and have higher impact factors than those with homogeneous
authorship.

Additionally, [**diverse** scientific communities are more **likely** to
**identify** research questions **relevant** to **underserved**
populations]{.underline} and address blind spots in experimental design.
For example, medical research conducted by homogeneous teams has
historically overlooked sex-based differences in drug metabolism,
leading to adverse outcomes that might have been anticipated with more
diverse research teams.

[If scientists]{.underline} from these groups or those working on these
important societal topics [feel unwelcome]{.underline},
[underfunded]{.underline}, [or]{.underline} that their contributions are
[devalued]{.underline}, they may be among the first to consider leaving
U.S. institutions.

This would result not only in [a **loss** of specific
expertise]{.underline} but also in a [**narrowing** of the U.S.
**scientific agenda**]{.underline}, [making it less **reflective** of
and responsive to the needs of a diverse society]{.underline}.

The exodus of diverse scientific talent could [trigger a **negative**
feedback loop]{.underline}, [where remaining researchers
from]{.underline} underrepresented groups [feel **increasingly
isolated**]{.underline}, [leading to further departures]{.underline}.
International competitors actively recruiting these scientists would
gain not just individual talent but entire research programs and
networks of collaborators, potentially shifting centers of excellence
away from the U.S.

Ultimately, [this **brain drain** could undermine]{.underline} American
[leadership in addressing **critical** challenges]{.underline} requiring
diverse perspectives, [from climate change **adaptation** to **health**
equity]{.underline} to inclusive technology development.

#### Scientists [quit]{.underline} and [no one]{.underline} replaces them. That [destroys]{.underline} the scientific economy.

Even before scientists consider leaving the country, the
administration\'s actions appear to be fostering an internal \"**[brain
drain]{.underline}**\" [within the U.S. scientific system]{.underline}.
This phenomenon [manifests]{.underline} as scientists self-censoring
their research topics, shifting their focus away from controversial (yet
potentially critical) areas, or becoming hesitant to pursue careers in
government service. This subtle exodus of talent and ideas **[represents
an immediate threat to scientific innovation and policy
development]{.underline}**.

This [**internal** shift represents a **loss** of scientific
**dynamism**]{.underline} and direction that precedes, and [can
**exacerbate**]{.underline}, [any subsequent **external**
exodus]{.underline}. Reports indicate that scientists are actively
removing \"politically-charged keywords\" such as \"climate change\" or
\"DEI\" from their grant proposals to enhance their chances of funding.
This trend is particularly pronounced among early-career researchers who
feel most vulnerable to funding uncertainties and political shifts.

The [**consequences** of this **internal** brain drain are
**far-reaching**]{.underline}, [affecting]{.underline} not only current
research outputs but also long-term scientific capacity building and
institutional knowledge retention. When scientists avoid certain
research domains due to political pressures rather than scientific
merit, **[the entire knowledge ecosystem suffers]{.underline}** from
artificial constraints on inquiry.

Graduate students are similarly adapting, focusing less on explicit
terms related to diversity, equity, and inclusion or climate change, and
instead emphasizing broader, more neutral terms like \"community-based
work\" or \"global change\". Faculty advisors report guiding students
toward \"safer\" research questions that are less likely to attract
political scrutiny or funding challenges, potentially steering promising
young scientists away from critically important research areas.

The fear of being targeted for pursuing research in certain areas, such
as climate science (which faces defunding and political criticism) or
DEI-related work (which is under scrutiny in university accreditation
and funding), can lead to widespread self-censorship or a reluctance
among researchers to enter or continue in these fields. Survey data
suggests that up to 30% of scientists in politically sensitive fields
have modified their research questions or methodologies to avoid
potential controversy.

Particularly concerning is the long-term impact on scientific leadership
positions. [As **senior** scientists in **government**
agencies]{.underline} retire or **[leave]{.underline}** their positions,
[**qualified** replacements]{.underline} may [be **deterred** from
**stepping** into these roles]{.underline} due to concerns about
political interference or job security, [creating **leadership** gaps in
**critical** scientific institutions]{.underline} that inform policy
decisions across multiple sectors.

applied]{.underline}. Most of the recommendations from numerous
independent expert panels have not been implemented.

Many leaders continue to see [pandemics as a **health**
problem]{.underline}. Yet it is clear that the [**impacts** of pandemics
are **economy-wide** and **society-wide**]{.underline}.
[**Misinformation** and **disinformation** about vaccines]{.underline}
and the role of the World Health Organization with respect to global
public health emergencies [persist]{.underline}. There has not yet been
the foresight to invest sufficiently in pandemic prevention,
preparedness and response to reduce the risks of another disastrous
global pandemic, even as the global economy takes years to recover from
the trillions lost from COVID-19. The significant social and health
impacts are ongoing.

At The Elders, we embarked on our pandemic strategy in the wake of the
COVID-19 response. We watched with dismay how nationalism, failure of
leadership and the unchecked power of the pharmaceutical industry led to
vast disparities in access to vaccines, diagnostics and treatments. We
learned of a [**fragmented** and **dysfunctional** global surveillance
system]{.underline}, which punished rather than rewarded countries
[which shared vital biological and genetic data]{.underline}. We saw the
disproportionate impact of the pandemic on women, caregivers and many
other vulnerable communities. In response, we joined with civil society
and other global leaders in calling for a clear set of global policies,
agreed upon at the highest levels of leadership, which ensure equity and
rights in pandemic prevention, preparedness and response.

[COVID-19 was the **worst pandemic** in **modern** times]{.underline}.
It [caused]{.underline} an estimated **[28 million excess
deaths]{.underline}**, [and **tens of trillions** of dollars in economic
losses. There was **further immeasurable impact** on the **wider human
fabric** of our societies]{.underline}, [including **unknown longer-term
damage**]{.underline} (in particular on children and adolescents). But
[a future pandemic could be much worse]{.underline}. **[Pandemics are
inequitable]{.underline}**. **[They hit the most vulnerable
people]{.underline}** and the countries least prepared for global shocks
hardest. During COVID-19 we witnessed large-scale injustice in how
poorer countries were unable to access the vaccines, diagnostics and
treatments they so desperately needed.

This is a collective action problem. We learned from COVID-19 that
**[none of us are safe unless all of us are safe]{.underline}**. Yet,
[**humanity** is **struggling** to put aside **individual** and
**national** interests and act in our **common interest**]{.underline}.
Some people and governments are actively turning against actions that
would significantly reduce risks. How can we break through this impasse?

### Impact\-\--Biodiversity\-\--2NC

#### Biodiversity [loss]{.underline} causes [extinction]{.underline}. 

**Weston '25** \[Phoebe; March 26; Biodiversity correspondent for The
Guardian; The Guardian, "Biodiversity loss in all species and every
ecosystem linked to humans -- report,"
theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/26/human-link-biodiversity-loss-species-ecosystems-climate-pollution-eawag-study-nature-aoe\]
//jwh

Humans are driving [biodiversity **loss** among **all
species**]{.underline} across the planet, according to a synthesis of
more than 2,000 studies.

The exhaustive global analysis [leaves **no doubt** about the
**devastating impact**]{.underline} humans are having on Earth,
according to researchers from the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic
Science and Technology (Eawag) and the University of Zurich. The
[study]{.underline} -- which [accounted for]{.underline} nearly
[**100,000 sites** across all continents]{.underline} --
[found]{.underline} that human activities had resulted in
"**[unprecedented effects on biodiversity]{.underline}**", according to
the paper, published in Nature.

Florian Altermatt, professor of aquatic ecology at the University of
Zurich and head of Eawag, said: "[It is **one** of the
**largest**]{.underline} syntheses of the human
**[impacts]{.underline}** on biodiversity ever conducted
**[worldwide]{.underline}**."

The team looked at terrestrial, freshwater and marine habitats, as well
as including all groups of organisms, including microbes, fungi, plants,
invertebrates, fish, birds and mammals.

Human pressures distinctly shifted community composition (essentially,
which species live where) and decreased local diversity, researchers
found. On average, the number of species at human-impacted sites was
almost 20% lower than at sites unaffected by humans.

Particularly [**severe** losses]{.underline} were [recorded among
**reptiles**]{.underline}, [**amphibians** and **mammals**]{.underline},
according to the paper. Their populations are often smaller than
invertebrates, which **[increases]{.underline}** the [chances of
**extinction**]{.underline}.

The analysis covered [**five** drivers of decline]{.underline}:
**[habitat change]{.underline}**, direct [**exploitation** of
resources]{.underline} (such as hunting or fishing), [climate
**change**]{.underline}, [**invasive** species and
**pollution**]{.underline}.

François Keck, lead author and a postdoctoral researcher in Altermatt's
research group, said: "Our findings [show]{.underline} that
[all]{.underline} five factors [have a **strong impact** on
biodiversity]{.underline} worldwide, in all groups of organisms and in
all ecosystems."

Pollution and habitat changes, often driven by agriculture, have a
particularly negative impact on biodiversity. Intensive agriculture --
especially arable farming -- involves large amounts of pesticides and
fertilisers, which result in a decline of biodiversity, but also shifts
the composition of species. The full extent of climate change and how it
affects species is not entirely understood.

While [the overall effect]{.underline} of human intervention [was
negative]{.underline}, some ambiguities remained: human impact on
wildlife varied by location, as did the degree to which biodiversity was
homogenised by human activity, researchers said.

Before this paper there had never been an attempt to combine findings
from such a large number of biodiversity research studies examining
humans' impact everywhere on the planet and in all groups of organisms;
most studies were limited to looking at either a single location or a
specific human impact. This meant it was difficult to make general
statements about the impacts of human activity on biodiversity,
researchers say.

Keck said: "**[It's not just the number of species that is
declining]{.underline}**. Human **[pressure is also changing the
composition of species communities]{.underline}**."

In mountainous areas, for example, specialised plants are being replaced
by those that typically grow at lower altitudes. This process is known
as the "elevator to extinction" as high-altitude plants have nowhere
else to go. This could mean that while the number of species might
remain the same, the diversity is reduced.

"[**Bending** the **curve** of **contemporary** biodiversity
loss]{.underline} and change [is **one** of the **greatest** challenges
facing our society]{.underline}," the researchers stated. They said the
paper should provide an "important benchmark" for the development and
assessment of future conservation strategies.

BOSTON (AP) --- [A **federal** judge]{.underline} has
**[blocked]{.underline}** President Donald Tru[mp 's administration from
making **drastic** cuts to **research funding** provided by the
**N**ational **S**cience **F**oundation]{.underline}.

U.S. [District Judge **Indira Talwani**]{.underline} in Boston **[struck
down]{.underline}** on Friday [a policy change that could have
**stripped** universities of **tens of millions** of dollars in research
funding]{.underline}. The universities argued the move threatened
critical work in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, semiconductors
and other technology fields.

Talwani said the chang, announced by the NSF in May, was arbitrary and
capricious and contrary to law.

An email Saturday to the NSF was not immediately returned.

At issue are "indirect" costs, expenses such as building maintenance and
computer systems that aren't linked directly to a specific project.
Currently, the NSF determines each grant recipient's indirect costs
individually and is supposed to cover actual expenses.

The Trump administration has dismissed indirect expenses as "overhead"
and capped them for future awards by the NSF to universities at 15 % of
the funding for direct research costs.

The University of California, one of the plaintiffs, estimated the
change would cost it just under \$100 million a year.

[Judges have blocked **similar** caps]{.underline} that [the **Trump
administration** placed on grants]{.underline} by the Energy Department
and the National Institutes of Health.

Signs that [Congress **intends** to **push back** on the **Trump**
administration's]{.underline} wholesale [**slashing** of federal
**budgets**]{.underline} emerged during a Senate meeting Thursday that
kicked off the annual appropriations process.

Since January, the Trump administration has sought to significantly
downsize the federal government via mass layoffs and spending cuts.
Additionally, the administration has canceled grants and withheld
funding despite laws that require agencies to spend money as directed by
Congress.

However, on Thursday a [**subcommittee** that oversees the budgets
fo]{.underline}r the Justice and Commerce [Departments]{.underline} as
well as related science agencies [proposed **only a small cut** to the
National Science Foundation]{.underline} budget next fiscal year---[a
**far cry** from the **\$5 billion** reduction that President Donald
**Trump** wants to see]{.underline}.

Instead, [NSF will get just over **\$9 billion**]{.underline}, a \$16
million cut, said Sen. Jerry Moran, the Kansas Republican who chairs the
subcommittee. [The bill also]{.underline} sends about [**\$10 million**
more to the National **Weather** Service and **boosts funding** for
National Aeronautics and **Space Administration**]{.underline}.

Although **[the science funding received bipartisan
support]{.underline}**, a fight over funding for the new Federal Bureau
of Investigations headquarters could tank the legislation. Sen. Chris
Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat and vice chair of the subcommittee,
objected to the Trump administration's decision to move the headquarters
to another building in Washington, D.C., rather than moving forward with
a plan approved during the Biden administration to build a facility in
Maryland. (Congress previously appropriated money for a new headquarters
and set the criteria for the site selection.)

[The National Science Foundation has begun **reinstating**]{.underline}
some [employees who were **laid off en masse**]{.underline} last week,
according to a union representative. However, the agency is bracing for
further workforce reductions: employees who took the "fork in the road"
deal will leave their positions on Monday and the White House has
mandated plans for "large-scale" staff reductions.

NSF laid off most of its probationary employees and almost all of its
intermittent experts on Feb. 18, reducing the agency's total workforce
by about 10%. NSF spokesperson Michael England said the layoffs applied
to 170 employees, 86 probationary and 84 classified as intermittent
experts. The layoffs came after instructions from the Trump
administration for agencies to lay off nearly all probationary
employees, who have served in their positions for relatively short
periods and have less legal protection from termination.

[The re-hiring]{.underline} of probationary employees [at NSF applies to
**veterans**]{.underline}, [those with **military

A [**key** US Senate committee]{.underline} has [indicated]{.underline}
that [it will **reject** the **massive budget cuts** that]{.underline}
President Donald [Trump]{.underline} has [**proposed** for]{.underline}
some science agencies, including [the National Science
Foundation]{.underline} (NSF) and NASA. The US Senate Committee on
Appropriations was **[ready to vote]{.underline}** today [to **advance**
a bill laying out fiscal year **2026 funding** for science]{.underline}.
However, the senators came to an impasse on an unrelated matter --- the
location for the new headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) --- and the committee went into a recess for an unknown length of
time.

Nevertheless, the hearing today offered the first hint that the US
Congress, which controls government spending, might ignore Trump's
wishes.

If enacted, Trump's proposal would have a devastating effect on US
science; earlier this week, the American Association for the Advancement
of Science released an analysis suggesting that the proposal would cut
all federally funded basic research by one-third. Over the past several
weeks, scientists, advocacy groups and lobbyists have been pleading with
members of Congress to protect funding for research agencies. The
campaign seems to be working: under the Senate committee's bill, [the
NSF's budget would **drop** by **only 0.67%**]{.underline}, [rather than
by the 57% Trump requested]{.underline}, and many NASA space and Earth-
science missions would continue, rather than being shut down (see
'Request rebuffed'). "This bill protects key science missions,' Jerry
Moran, a Republican senator for Kansas, said at the meeting.

also a priority of Trump's education department. Cornell University's

social media harassment, hate speech and misinformation without the help
of content moderators or government regulators.

"The irony is it's like a free speech way of addressing speech,"
Margolin said.

Are more cuts coming?

The NSF declined to say if more cuts are coming. The terminated funding
mirrors earlier cuts to medical research funding from the National
Institutes of Health.

A group of scientists and health groups sued the NIH earlier this month,
arguing that those cuts were illegal and threatened medical cures.

[The cuts at NSF]{.underline} so far [are a **tiny portion** of all of

Access to remote field sites. The USAP has long been a leader in
supporting deep-field research campaigns, and the community expressed
strong desires to see continued support for these world-class
capabilities. For the proposed Changing Ice Initiative in particular, it
is essential to have expanded access to deep-field sites in West
Antarctica, including work around and under the ice sheet edges.
Critical target areas for U.S. efforts include the Amundsen Sea sector,
the Ross Ice Shelf, and the grounding lines of the Siple Coast. [Key
needs include]{.underline} a deep-field camp and [**logistics hub**,
over-snow science traverse **capabilities**, ship support for research

[[**International** cooperation in science]{.mark}]{.underline} and
technology (S&T) plays an important role in driving scientific
discovery, enhancing economic prosperity, and addressing broader foreign
policy interests. One such program that infuses S&T into foreign policy
is the U.S. Department of State's (DoS) Embassy Science Fellows (ESF)
program, which is designed to [**[promote]{.mark}** scientific
[personnel deployment]{.mark} in support of **diplomacy**]{.underline}.
The aim of this paper is to utilize nearly two decades of data to assess
the ESF program from a U.S. DoS perspective. We analyzed Fellows'
perceptions of their ESF experience, obtained through both quantitative
and qualitative surveys, to identify both successful program elements
and areas that might benefit from further improvements. Since 2001,
[the]{.underline} U.S. [[government]{.underline}]{.mark} has
[[dispatched]{.underline}]{.mark} approximately [[**500**
science]{.underline}]{.mark} and technology
[[experts]{.underline}]{.mark}, spanning twenty-five federal agencies,
[[most often from the]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, **[[National Science Foundation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and U.S.
Department of Agriculture (accounting for over 50% of ESF). Through
2001-2019, requests for ESFs Fellows were submitted by U.S. Embassies
and Consulates [in **142** countries]{.underline}. In response, the
program was able to [[send experts to **116**
countries]{.underline}]{.mark}, with deployments in China (N=51),
Portugal (N=15), and the Philippines (N=14) leading. We found it
encouraging that most Fellows reported favorable assessments of the
program and its results and benefits to Fellows and hosts. They also
reported that there was expanded international S&T cooperation and
enhanced understanding of U.S. foreign policy goals. Also encouraging
was the finding that home agencies benefitted following their employees'
ESF experience, as Fellows were better poised to advance the diverse,
agency mission and priorities. The main sources of ESF dissatisfaction
identified by Fellows were perceived isolation and insufficiently clear
aims. Overall, this paper finds that the ESF program has been successful
in terms of providing benefits to hosts, Fellows, and their employing
agencies, and in expanding international S&T cooperation. We offer our
perspective on opportunities for improvement and areas for further study
and propose the ESF program as a model for other countries.

Another major hurdle to widespread adoption of scientific data is often
[less about the data than it is about the ease of accessing that
data.]{.underline} Availability concerns in this case include those
related to people, technological and policy. In the past, [many
[researchers]{.mark} have [shown]{.mark} a [hesitancy]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} openly [share]{.mark} [data]{.mark} [when]{.mark} there is a
[perceived loss]{.mark} of value [through]{.mark} sharing, concerns over
[misuse of data]{.mark}, and [potential]{.mark} [competition]{.mark}
when the data are made more broadly accessible]{.underline}.

[however]{.mark}, [[most are open]{.mark} to the idea]{.underline} so
long as the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. Additionally, [recent
[surveys]{.mark}]{.underline} have [[indicated]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[when]{.mark} [proper assurances]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [credit]{.mark}
are [made]{.mark} for datasets, organizational [support]{.mark} is

[comprehensive]{.mark} assessment [of]{.mark} [permafrost]{.mark}
[responses]{.mark} to climate change]{.underline} and by extent may
empower the individual researchers and amplify the findings. On the
technology side, scientific datasets have continued to grow in size as
the ability to gather data at high resolution has rapidly increased.
Low-cost sensors, an increasing number of open-access satellite systems,
and the computational resources to generate massive datasets have fueled
this growth, but computational power, storage resources, and network
technologies have been unable to keep pace with the increase in data
volume \[53\]. [Making data available broadly, and freely to end users,
requires continuing financial resources to support the assets needed to
serve and distribute that data effectively over long distances,

on long-term availability of research data indicates that datasets used

//jwh

Established in 1950 at the outset of the Cold War, [the NSF]{.underline}
was the realization of a concept envisioned by Vannevar Bush in his
famous 1945 report, "Science: The Endless Frontier."
[Focus]{.underline}ed [on]{.underline} basic [**research**
in]{.underline} the physical [sciences]{.underline}, the agency grew
slowly but steadily during the 1950s, experiencing a burst of political
support and funding growth after the launch of the Soviet Union's
Sputnik I satellite shocked the nation in 1957.

At its heart was a management ethos borrowed from successful wartime
research: the idea that [**knowledgeable** scientists could identify the
**most fruitful** topics and the best ways to **pursue**
them]{.underline}. The NSF usually recruits experienced scientists to
manage its programs, [**bringing** them from **universities** and
research institutes]{.underline} to its Virginia headquarters for a few
years' duration. [**Thousands** of]{.underline} other [scientists have
served on its **peer-review** panels]{.underline}.

The [agency play]{.underline}ed a [**leading role** in bringing the
internet]{.underline} and World Wide Web to a broad spectrum of users.
Its NSFNET computer network, originally intended for the academic and
educational pursuits of scientists at U.S. universities, was opened to
public and commercial use in 1991, serving [as the
internet's]{.underline} "[backbone]{.underline}." The first widely
available Web browser --- Mosaic, the prototype of many subsequent
browsers --- was developed by two programmers at the NSF-funded National
Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois.
And during the mid-1990s, NSF supported Stanford University's Digital
Library Initiative, in which graduate students Larry Page and Sergey
Brin developed the guts of their Google search engine.

Another [**outstanding** NSF **contribution** is the]{.underline} Laser
Interferometer Gravitational- Wave Observatory (**[LIGO]{.underline}**),
[which]{.underline} has [recorded **incredibly faint** space-time
**ripples** triggered **eons** earlier by **cataclysmal black hole
mergers**]{.underline}. Its program managers' risk-taking and patience
were rewarded by this breakthrough, for which three LIGO scientists
received the 2017 Nobel Prize in physics. The NSF's farsighted
management of this project, [sustained over **three
decades**]{.underline}, has also [stimulated advances in laser and
quantum tech]{.underline}nologies.

[The **foundation**]{.underline} has also [supported **cutting-edge
research** in microbiology]{.underline} --- for example, [that of
Jennifer Doudna]{.underline}, who shared the [**2020 Nobel Prize**
for]{.underline} the discovery of the [**gene-editing**
tech]{.underline}nology [that is now the **primary** tool for
**research** in molecular biology]{.underline}.

These striking examples underscore the [**benefits** and **wisdom** of
allowing **NSF** scientist]{.underline}-managers sufficient [**freedom**
to support **long-term** basic-**research** projects]{.underline} whose
outcomes cannot be anticipated. That was the management ethos followed
by Bush and his World War II-era Office of Scientific Research and
Development, which led to many decisive weapons technologies.

#### The NSF is [key]{.underline} to [worldwide]{.underline} scientific research and American [prosperity]{.underline}.

[NSF **investments**]{.underline} have [made **America** and **American
science** great]{.underline}. At least [**268 Nobel laureates** received
**NSF grants**]{.underline} during their careers. [The foundation has
**partnered** with **agencies** across the government]{.underline} since
it was created, [including those dealing with **national security** and
**space exploration**]{.underline}. The Federal Reserve estimates that
[government-supported **research** from the NSF]{.underline} and other
agencies has [had a **return** on **investment** of]{.underline} 150% to
[**300%** since 1950]{.underline}, meaning for every dollar U.S.
taxpayers invested, they got back between \$1.50 and \$3.

However, that funding is now at risk.

Since January, layoffs, leadership resignations and a massive proposed
reorganization have threatened the integrity and mission of the National
Science Foundation. Hundreds of research grants have been terminated.
The administration's proposed federal budget for fiscal year 2026 would
cut NSF's funding by 55%, an unprecedented reduction that would end
federal support for science research across a wide range of discipines.

At my own geology lab, I have seen [NSF grants **catalyze research** and
the work of dozens of students who have collected **data** that's now
**used** to **reduce** risks from **earthquakes**]{.underline},
**[floods]{.underline}**, **[landslides]{.underline}**,
**[erosion]{.underline}**, [**sea**-level **rise** and **melting
glaciers**]{.underline}.

I have also served on advisory committees and review panels for the NSF
over the past 30 years and have seen the value the foundation produces
for the American people.

American science's greatness stemmed from war

[In the 1940s]{.underline}, [with the **advent** of **nuclear
weapons**]{.underline}, [the space race and the **intensification** of
the **Cold War**]{.underline}, American science and engineering
expertise [became **increasingly critical** for national
**defense**]{.underline}. At the time, most basic and applied research
was done by the military.

Vannevar Bush, an electrical engineer who oversaw military research
efforts during World War II, including development of the atomic bomb,
had a different idea.

He articulated an expansive scientific vision for the United States in
Science: The Endless Frontier. The report was a [**blueprint** for an
**American research juggernaut** grounded in the **expertise** of
university **faculty**]{.underline}, staff and graduate students.

On May 10, 1950, after five years of debate and compromise, President
Harry Truman signed legislation creating the National Science
Foundation. It put Bush's vision to work. Since then, [the
**foundation** has become the **leading funder** of basic **research**
in the **United States**]{.underline}.

NSF's mandate, then as now, was to [support **basic research** and
spread funding for science across **all 50 states**]{.underline}.
Expanding America's scientific workforce was and [**remains** integral
to **American prosperity**]{.underline}. By 1952, the foundation was
awarding merit fellowships to graduate and postdoctoral scientists from
every state.

There were compromises. Control of NSF rested with presidential
appointees, disappointing Bush. He wanted scientists in charge to avoid
political interference with the foundation's research agenda.

**[NSF funding matters to everyone]{.underline}**,
**[everywhere]{.underline}**

Today, American tax dollars supporting science go to every state in the
union.

The states with the most NSF grants awarded between 2011 and 2024
include several that voted Republican in the 2024 election -- Texas,
Florida, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania -- and several that
voted Democratic, including Massachusetts, New York, Virginia and
Colorado.

[More than **1,800 public** and **private** institutions]{.underline},
scattered across all 50 states, [receive NSF funding]{.underline}. [The
grants pay the **salaries** of **staff**]{.underline}, [**faculty** and
**students**]{.underline}, [boosting **local employment** and supporting
college towns and cities]{.underline}. For states with major research
universities, those grants [add up to **hundreds of millions** of
dollars **each year**]{.underline}. Even states with few universities
each see tens of millions of dollars for research.

This year\'s awards will [support]{.underline} seven [**research
grants** and **nine seed projects** across **36 institutions** and
companies through the **NSF**]{.underline} Future Manufacturing (NSF FM)
[program]{.underline}.

The NSF FM program [focuses on areas such as
**biomanufacturing**]{.underline}, [**cyber manufacturing** and
**ecomanufacturing**]{.underline}, with some efforts [exploring
**intersections** with **quantum** manufacturing]{.underline}. The
program emphasizes convergence, [bringing together teams from **across
disciplines** to create new]{.underline}, potentially
**[transformative]{.underline}** manufacturing
**[capabilities]{.underline}**, [going **far beyond** improvements to
**current** manufacturing processes]{.underline}.

\"The FM program targets [**critical technical gaps** and **lays** the
**foundation** for **emerging** sectors]{.underline}, [including
tech]{.underline}nologies [that **haven\'t yet been

the NSF director. \"NSF is investing in teams that [bring]{.underline}
together **[scientific]{.underline}**, [**engineering** and
**manufacturing expertise** to **equip** the American **workforce** for

This year\'s FM awards include:

Seven research grants, each receiving up to \$3 million over a four-year
period, to support multidisciplinary teams conducting fundamental
research to enable new manufacturing capabilities, materials, or
systems. Projects span a range of topics, including bioengineering in
resource-constrained environments, \"recyclofacturing\" using artificial
intelligence to create products from metal scrap, and using robotics and
digital twins for additive manufacturing of multi-material systems.

Nine seed grants, each receiving up to \$500,000 over a two-year period,
to support early-stage teams exploring novel concepts and partnerships
that could shape future directions in manufacturing. Seed projects
include efforts in future photonic quantum manufacturing using DNA,
self-learning tools to create superconducting circuits, using
cyanobacteria and water for low-energy cement manufacturing, and
enabling domestic lithium extraction from unconventional sources.

By [**advancing** research in]{.underline} areas [such as the
**manufacture** of **critical materials**]{.underline}, [**quantum**
devices and **semiconductor** production]{.underline}, [**human-robot**
collaboration]{.underline} and biologically based manufacturing, the

#### **The NSF is key to [rapid]{.underline}, effective [pandemic]{.underline} response.**

**Tabarrok '23** \[Maxwell Tabarrok is a pre-doctoral researcher at
Dartmouth College, working with Heidi Williams on the economics of
science, 7-17-2023, \"How the NSF Moved Faster than the NIH During
COVID-19\", Institute for Progress,
https://ifp.org/how-the-nsf-moved-faster-than-the-nih/\]//LASA-AR

[COVID-19 tested **every aspect**]{.underline} of the scientific
apparatus, but it [put **unique strains** on the systems that allocate
funding]{.underline}. Some funding mechanisms managed to allocate
resources with dispatch. Operation Warp Speed (OWS), the most obvious
example, showed that [smart federal funding could generate **incredible
breakthroughs** for society at a remarkable pace.]{.underline} At the
same time, many features of the federal response proved too slow,
failing to prevent avoidable sickness and death.

[It was **incredibly important** to maximize the speed at which pandemic
research was]{.underline} supported and [rolled out, and multiple
federal agencies tried to **quickly deploy** resources to
pandemic-related science.]{.underline} But [despite a]{.underline}
near-[universal sense of motivation]{.underline} to move quickly, [the
country's largest scientific]{.underline} [funding agencies delivered
**disparate outcomes**]{.underline}. [The **N**ational **S**cience
**F**oundation]{.underline} (NSF) managed to [ramp up COVID-19-related
granting four months faster than the National Institutes of
Health]{.underline} (NIH); a remarkable pace during an emergency when
every day mattered. The results suggest that policymakers should grant
additional flexibility for our science funding institutions to expedite
review during crises.

Comparing the NIH and NSF

[The basic story of]{.underline} scientific [grant funding]{.underline}
during the pandemic [is that while the NIH spent **more money**, the NSF
was able to act]{.underline} much [fast]{.underline}er in getting grants
out the door. The following graph compares the monthly granting rates of
the NIH (purple) and NSF (orange). Grants are marked as pandemic-related
if they contain words like "pandemic," "Covid," "SARS-CoV-2," or other
related terms in their title or description.

The [**difference in speed** for issuing pandemic-related
grants]{.underline} immediately jumps out in March of 2020. The NSF's
[pandemic granting overtook the NIH]{.underline}, and remained ahead for
the next 5 months. The NSF only put out its call for pandemic-related
grants in April 2020, yet it hit the peak of its granting the following
month. The NIH's granting didn't peak until September 2020, even though
it had been accepting proposals since February 2020. As we'll see, its
most successful rapid grants program mirrored some of the strengths of
the NSF.

To be clear, in dollar-weighted terms, the NIH would spend about 10
times more than the NSF on pandemic-related projects over 2020. But this
shouldn't be surprising, given that the NIH has five times the budget of
the NSF and received 13 times more pandemic research stimulus money in
April of 2020. What is surprising is that, [when the world needed it
most, the NSF was able to **bootstrap** a funding program in months, in
a field outside its usual purview,]{.underline} rivaling an organization
five times its size.

The [NSF's pandemic spending responded to]{.underline} the [**increased
importance** of timing]{.underline}. While in normal years, both
organizations have disbursed only about half the year's money by May,
the NSF spiked its pandemic spending in May 2020. While the NIH did
amplify its funding of pandemic-related research, it stayed roughly
within the normal schedule of the organization: a slow ramp to a peak in
September, and a complete pause in October. The NIH didn't schedule its
funding of pandemic research in 2020 all that differently than in 2019.
In normal years, the returns to science funding don't vary much from
month-to-month. But during a crisis like COVID-19, a one-month
difference in the vaccine research timeline could have saved tens of
thousands of lives.

Despite its encompassing name, the National Science Foundation was seen
as the "puny partner" of federal science funding when it was created,
and it still wields a smaller budget and less influence than similar
agencies today. But [the NSF went from funding **essentially zero**
pandemic-related research in the past decade to sending **over 800**
pandemic-related grants out the door, with \$140 million dollars
attached in a **single year.**]{.underline} How did the historically
puny partner make such a big turnaround into a field it had
comparatively little funding expertise in?

Grand challenge [questions **requir**]{.underline}ing [a **deeper**
understanding of biological systems]{.underline} and technologies are as
diverse as life itself. [Understanding]{.underline} the complexity of
[**living** systems and their **interaction**]{.underline} with
human-derived products and processes, **[ensur]{.underline}**ing
**[safe]{.underline}**, [**ethical** and **equitable**]{.underline}
access [to]{.underline} and [**co-generation** of]{.underline} knowledge
and products, requires the [sustained **development** of
technologies]{.underline}, sophisticated instrumentation, workflow
pipelines and their automation, and advanced computing that are beyond
the capabilities found in the laboratories of individual investigators.
[**Broad access** to these tools]{.underline}, workflows, processes, and
knowledge bases in a facility that [is capable of **bespoke**
design]{.underline} and process scale-up, in response to user needs, is
essential [for addressing **grand** challenges and]{.underline}
translating the **[knowledge]{.underline}** created into applications
for the bioeconomy, to meet societal and national needs.

Recognizing this gap, [**NSF** is establishing the **BioFoundries**
Program]{.underline}. NSF envisions its BioFoundries
[serving]{.underline} both [as **user** facilities and as **innovation**
hubs for cutting-edge]{.underline}, multidisciplinary [research
with]{.underline} the important role of [democratizing access
to]{.underline} the tools of [**modern** biology]{.underline} and
biotechnology [for]{.underline} the purposes of [**advancing**
scientific discoveries]{.underline} and translating those discoveries to
address pressing societal challenges. [A BioFoundry is an **integrated**
facility that combines **biological**]{.underline}, **[chemical
biology]{.underline}**, [and engineering biology systems]{.underline}
and tools [with automation]{.underline}, high throughput measurement,
integrated data acquisition and analysis, [and a]{.underline}rtificial
[i]{.underline}ntelligence (AI) and machine learning [to enable
**feedback loops** that facilitate progressive]{.underline} end-to-end
[cycles of **design**]{.underline}, **[build]{.underline}**,
**[test]{.underline}**, [and **learn**]{.underline}. In addition to
providing broad access, [a **BioFoundry** develops
innovative]{.underline} (bio)**[tech]{.underline}**nologies, [invents
**new** processes and workflows]{.underline}, integrates advanced
computation, [and creates]{.underline} reproducible [results and
**shareable** knowledge]{.underline}-bases [to **accelerate**
the]{.underline} design-build-test-learn [pipeline from **basic**
research to translation]{.underline}. By applying the same streamlining
and automation principles that continue [to revolutionize
manufacturing]{.underline}, **[BioFoundries]{.underline}** can [operate
with **speed** and at **scales** not possible in **individual**
laboratories or]{.underline} typical [university]{.underline} core
[facilities]{.underline}.

The NSF BioFoundries Program will [address a **critical** need for
national infrastructure to **support** biotech]{.underline}nology and
the bioeconomy, which has been highlighted by recent publications1, 2,
workshop reports3, 4, 5, white papers6, 7, the U.S. White House
Executive Order on Advancing Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing
Innovation for a Sustainable, Safe, and Secure American Bioeconomy8, and
the ensuing reports on Bold Goals for U.S. Biotechnology and
Biomanufacturing9. [The **BioFoundries** Program]{.underline} also
aligns with, and [follows]{.underline} naturally [from]{.underline},
[NSF\'s **investments** in]{.underline} diverse areas of biological
[sciences]{.underline}, chemical biology, biotechnology and
bioengineering through programs such as: Enabling Discovery through
Genomic Tools; NeuroNex; Plant Genome Research Program; Dimensions of
Biodiversity (now Biodiversity on a Changing Planet); Organismal
Response to Climate Change; Future Manufacturing; Cyber-Physical
Systems; Smart Health and Biomedical Research in the Era of Artificial
Intelligence; Foundations of Emerging Technologies; Molecular
Foundations of Biotechnology; Reproducible Cells and Organoids via
Directed Differentiation Encoding; [**Accelerating** Innovations in
Biomanufacturing]{.underline} Approaches [through
**Collaboration**]{.underline} Between NSF and the DOE BETO funding
Agile Biofoundry and others. The foundational or use-inspired scientific
research drivers for NSF BioFoundries could leverage these prior
investments or address any other field of science and engineering
supported by NSF.

[BioFoundries]{.underline} are intended to [empower the **research**
community by providing the **infrastructure**]{.underline} needed [to
match **new tech**]{.underline}nologies [to]{.underline} specific
research drivers and [**facilitate** transformative discoveries through
**cutting-edge** research]{.underline} as well as broadening access,
training, de facto standardization, centralization, and integration of
data and technologies. [By providing this **infrastructure** at
**scale**]{.underline} with broad opportunity for access, [each
BioFoundry would also offer **research** and **training** opportunities
for a **diversity** of institutions]{.underline}, including R1 and
non-R1 research universities, primarily undergraduate and
minority-serving institutions, and institutions in EPSCoR jurisdictions,
and increase the capacity of a scientific workforce prepared to meet the
challenges of the 21st century and improve the bioeconomy. In short, NSF
envisions BioFoundries embodying Sydney Brenner\'s famous assertion that
\"Progress in science depends on new techniques, new discoveries, and
new ideas, probably in that order.\"

and **knowledge** bases]{.underline}, and the design and scale-up
capabilities necessary to ensure all ideas reach their potential.

[Each **NSF BioFoundry**]{.underline} will [focus on a **different**

will [**advance** both in-house and user-initiated
projects]{.underline}, [**train** the **next gen**]{.underline}eration
[of the scientific **workforce**]{.underline}, engage with consumers and
users of the products developed, [and]{.underline} continually [enhance
workflows]{.underline} and processes [to **accelerate** the
**translation** of ideas]{.underline}.

\"Across all fields of science and engineering, [addressing **grand**
challenges requires access to **advanced tech**]{.underline}nologies,
sophisticated instrumentation and workflows, [but not every
**researcher**]{.underline} at every institution [can access

**anywhere**]{.underline}. Not only will these NSF BioFoundries advance
biology, they also will lead to developments in artificial intelligence,
data storage, health, climate resilience and more.\"

The facilities will drastically expand and democratize biotechnology
capabilities in the United States. To date, [such
**tech**]{.underline}nologies have [been **limited** to **specific**
academic labs]{.underline}, certain parts of industry and two government
facilities: the U.S. Department of Energy\'s Agile BioFoundry and the
National Institute of Standards and Technology\'s Living Measurement
Systems Foundry. [By acting as **user** facilities]{.underline} without
charging user fees, [NSF BioFoundries]{.underline} will [enable
**research** and **translation** at **various**
institutions]{.underline} --- from research-intensive universities to
minority-serving institutions, community colleges and others.

Education, training and outreach efforts will [**further** the

from kindergarten through graduate school, [supporting **industry** and
**translational** partnerships]{.underline}, [and creating **materials**
to **educate** the **public** on **engineering** biology]{.underline},
[**synthetic** biology and **biotech**]{.underline}nology. Several NSF
BioFoundries will work with minority-serving institutions, including
historically Black colleges and universities, to bring in groups

mechanisms]{.underline} and resources [to **ensure** reproducibility of
results]{.underline} and the ability [to **share** data in]{.underline}
both **[human]{.underline}**- [and **machineusable**
formats]{.underline}. BioFoundries should address the issue of
reproducibility through verifiable algorithmic approaches to build trust
and confidence of the research as well as user community and by
providing repositories of data, tools, and algorithms that would
[**allow** outside groups to **reproduce** the scientific results
obtained]{.underline}.

The research supported by [BioFoundries]{.underline} may [**follow**
from the work supported by]{.underline} previous or existing [**NSF**
programs]{.underline}, or it could represent an entirely new direction.
A key feature of the BioFoundries should be [the deep integration of
advanced discovery]{.underline}, **[tech]{.underline}**nological
[innovation]{.underline}, [**knowledge** sharing]{.underline}, [and
**collaborations** to open]{.underline} new [avenues for]{.underline}
translating results from basic [research to **societally** beneficial
outcomes]{.underline}. Additional information on the research and
technology components of the BioFoundries can be found in the Proposal
Preparation section of this solicitation.

BioFoundries are envisioned to combine characteristics of user
facilities and research centers in a scientific ecosystem that includes:

A user facility that [provides **strategic**]{.underline} technical
[**capacity** and **infrastructure**]{.underline},
**[resources]{.underline}**, **[samples]{.underline}**,
**[workflows]{.underline}**, [and **data**]{.underline}, in a manner
that is open and responsive to a diverse community of external
researchers at various institutions and that fosters the creation of
standards for the above;

//jwh

From witnessing an extraordinary solar eclipse to ensuring that
artificial intelligence resources are available to researchers and
educators to investing in research centers that bring together a broad
array of partners and collaborators, [the]{.underline} U.S. [National
Science Foundation made **significant** strides in 2024]{.underline}.

[NSF\'s **support** of **curiosity**-driven]{.underline} and
use-inspired [research]{.underline}, [combined with **investments**
in]{.underline} research [**infrastructure** and]{.underline} workforce
**[development]{.underline}**, [continues to expand]{.underline} U.S.
[**leadership** across a **broad** range of scientific]{.underline} and
technology [areas]{.underline}. [The agency\'s vision]{.underline} and
leadership [in]{.underline} areas such as **[AI]{.underline}**,
**[quantum]{.underline}** information science, next-generation [wireless
networking]{.underline}, **[biotech]{.underline}**nology [and
**advanced** computing]{.underline} continue to [establish the
**strong** foundation needed to **ensure** a more **innovative** and
**prosperous** future]{.underline} for the nation.

Investing in the AI infrastructure and innovations of tomorrow

[NSF\'s long-term vision]{.underline} and investments in AI research
since the 1960s have [set the stage for the **understanding** and
**application**]{.underline} of AI [**today** and]{.underline} into [the
**future**]{.underline}.

This vision includes the democratization of access to computational
power and other resources necessary for AI research and innovation. The
National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR) pilot,
launched in January 2024, is a concept for a shared national resource
infrastructure connecting U.S. researchers to the computational, data,
software, training and education resources required to fuel AI research
and discovery.  The pilot, a proof of concept to demonstrate and
investigate all major elements of the NAIRR vision, is led by NSF in
partnership with 12 other federal agencies and more than 25
nongovernment contributors. Through a competitive process, the pilot has
awarded more than 150 research and education projects ranging from AI
innovation and cybersecurity to agriculture, health care and wildfire
detection.

[NSF]{.underline} also [add]{.underline}ed [**new institutes** under the
National AI Research **Institutes** program]{.underline}, bringing the
total number of institutes to 27. Each institute focuses on specialized
issues where AI can be game-changing. They are [supported by a
**network** of **500** funded]{.underline} and collaborative
[institutions **nationwide**]{.underline}, enabled by partnerships
between NSF, other federal agencies and the private sector. In 2024, NSF
and Simons Foundation partnered to launch two AI Institutes for
astronomical sciences. The NSF-Simons AI Institute for Cosmic Origins,
led by The University of Texas at Austin, aims to accelerate
time-consuming aspects of astronomical research, such as processing and
analyzing large amounts of data. The NSF-Simons AI Institute for the
Sky, led by Northwestern University, will tackle complex problems in
astrophysics and astronomy, such as the role that dark matter and dark
energy play in the universe.

The surge in AI-enabled organizations and services is driving a growing
need for AI-capable workers, with demands for an AI-ready workforce
growing in finance, national security, health care, manufacturing and
more. Each of the 27 AI Institutes has an educational component, part of
a wider NSF effort to help expand the domestic STEM workforce.

Keeping the U.S. at the forefront of the quantum revolution

[NSF]{.underline} has also been a [leader in supporting **quantum**
research]{.underline} for over seven decades, and quantum-enabled
applications are starting to transform industries [at an
**unprecedented** pace]{.underline}. NSF\'s role in this transformation,
such as the NSF Quantum Leap Challenge Institutes, cannot be overstated.
These large-scale, interdisciplinary research endeavors [**catalyze
breakthroughs** across]{.underline} quantum
**[computation]{.underline}**, **[communication]{.underline}**,
[**simulation** and **sensing**]{.underline}.

#### The NSF is the [core]{.underline} foundation for [modern]{.underline} science.

//jwh

[The]{.underline} National Science Foundation (**[NSF]{.underline}**)
was [established]{.underline} 10 May 1950 [with a mission
to]{.underline} "[**promote** the **progress** of science]{.underline};
to [advance]{.underline} the **[national health]{.underline}**,
[**prosperity** and]{.underline} welfare; and to secure the national
defense." In its 70 years, [NSF has **spurred** **major advances** in
scientific knowledge]{.underline} and technological applications [by
serving as the]{.underline} nation's [leader in basic **research
funding**]{.underline}. We honor NSF's 70th anniversary by highlighting
seven NSF-funded programs in research and education.

1\. Deepwater Horizon Oil spill

[**Ten** years ago]{.underline}, [the **Deepwater** Horizon vessel
**exploded**]{.underline} --- ultimately [spilling]{.underline} over
[**168 million gallons** of oil into the **Gulf of Mexico**]{.underline}
--- [and NSF stepped in to help **respond** to the spill]{.underline}.
[With NSF]{.underline} support, [researchers analyzed **all** sides of
the **unprecedented** environmental **crisis**]{.underline}: where was
the oil moving? How did oil effect the deep ocean? And what could be
learned to better prepare us for the future? Learn about the insights
and ongoing questions in this consensus review of the spill's aftermath
and in Eos's coverage of the legacy that Deepwater Horizon left behind.

2\. Public radio and television

NSF is known to many scientists for its history supporting STEM
education in the classroom and lab. NSF also helped bring you publicly
accessible STEM TV and radio programming by providing major funding for
some of your childhood favorites such as the Magic School Bus and Bill
Nye the Science Guy. And NSF continues this legacy today -- just tune
into PBS Newshour and Science Wednesdays.

3\. [**Ozone** hole]{.underline}

[Responding to reports of **significant depletion** in atmospheric ozone
above **Antarctica**]{.underline}, [NSF worked to **quickly assemble**
the]{.underline} 1986 National [Ozone Expedition]{.underline} (NOZE) [to
determine the cause]{.underline}. NOZE researchers established that the
atmosphere contained significantly elevated levels of man-made compounds
called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). This was strong evidence that CFCs
significantly harm the stratospheric ozone that protects the Earth's
surface and the creatures on it, from ultraviolet radiation. [The **NOZE
research**]{.underline} on the ozone hole [was the **first definitive
evidence** of humanity's **ability** to affect the **global system** and
led **directly** to]{.underline} the 1987 Montreal Protocol, [the
**first** global **treaty** to address the environment]{.underline}.

4\. [**Strong curricula** for]{.underline} introductory
[science]{.underline}

For most non-science majors, formal science education stops at "Science
101." The Adler Planetarium in Chicago wants to make these undergraduate
intro courses count. [With funding from NSF]{.underline}'s Improving
Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) program, [the **Planetarium**
is]{.underline} currently [**developing** and **testing** curricula to
enhance introductory courses in **astronomy**]{.underline}, [**biology**
and **geoscience**]{.underline}. Focusing the courses around citizen
science provides opportunities for students to better understand how
science works, and gain skills using and analyzing data in real-world
applications. This project is ongoing, and the findings will be made
available to the public at classroom.zooniverse.org.

5\. Deep--sea exploration

[NSF has been a **major investor** in **deep**]{.underline}--[**sea**
research for]{.underline} the last **[60 years]{.underline}**. With the
HOV Alvin's capability to submerge 15,000 feet and the JOIDES Resolution
able to drill 6 miles into the seafloor, [**NSF-funded**
research]{.underline} vessels have [been at the **fore** of **major
discoveries** into deep sea **exploration**]{.underline}. These
discoveries [have **helped** the world **better understand** oceanic
**dead** zones]{.underline}, [**hurricanes** and
**tsunamis**]{.underline}, [deep sea **biodiversity** and the
**impacts** of glacial **ice melt**]{.underline}. With the oceans
undergoing rapid changes and the global race to mine the seabed for rare
minerals, deep sea research has become more important than ever.

6\. Student opportunities

To address statewide concerns around stormwater pollution, the
University of Maine used NSF funding to create the Stormwater Management
Research Team (SMART), a program that engaged high school students in
stormwater issues within their communities. Participants worked with
their teachers, university faculty, and community leaders to develop
solutions at a summer "SMART Institute." The program sought to serve
those from backgrounds underrepresented in STEM fields, with over 75% of
the participating students self-identifying as either female or a racial
minority. A second NSF grant formed a SMART Collaborative to expand the
model to more states.

7\. COVID-19 Response

[NSF is a **critical** part of the **COVID-19** pandemic
response]{.underline}. [New COVID-19 projects are studying
**self-sanitizing** mask tech]{.underline}nology, [environmental impacts
on **viral** biology and]{.underline} the [**atomic**-level viral
**structure**]{.underline}. What's more, decades of basic science
research in supercomputing technology, 3--D printing and the biology of
emerging viruses is being brought to bear on the crisis in myriad ways
--- from simulating the spread of the virus to rapidly manufacturing
life-saving PPE for our frontline workers.

[For **seven decades** NSF has **prepared** us for **complex**
challenges of the **future**]{.underline}. Learn more about NSF's 70
years at their History Wall. And be sure to share your appreciation for
NSF on social media throughout the week of May 11th!

### Internal\-\--Other Institutions\-\--AT: CERN\-\--2NC

#### The LHC is still causing investment [drain]{.underline} and internal [collapse]{.underline} at CERN. That [decks]{.underline} fill-in.

**McKie '25** \[Robin; March 29; Science Editor for The Guardian; The
Guardian, "Just a big toy -- or key to the universe? Row over even
Larger Hadron Collider,"

//jwh

[Scientists are refining plans to build]{.underline} the world's biggest
machine at a site beneath the Swiss-French border. More than
**[\$30bn]{.underline}** (£23bn) would be spent [drilling a]{.underline}
91km **[circular tunnel]{.underline}** in which subatomic particles
would be accelerated to near light speeds and smashed into each other.
From the resulting nuclear debris, scientists hope they will then find
clues that would help them understand the detailed makeup of the
universe.

[It is an **extraordinarily ambitious** project]{.underline}. However,
it is also a controversial one -- for many scientists fear the machine,
[the Future Circular Collider]{.underline} (FCC), could [**soak up
funding** for]{.underline} subatomic physics for [**decades** and leave
**promising** new research avenues **starved** of
resources]{.underline}.

Others argue that **[the mega-­collider is being imposed on physicists by
senior officials at Cern]{.underline}**, [the European Organization for
Nuclear Research]{.underline}, without properly consulting researchers.

"I'm amazed to see how they are lining up this concept," particle
physicist Halina Abramowicz of Tel Aviv University told the Observer.
"This is not how things are supposed to work. The physics community is
supposed to tell Cern what should be the next step, not the other way
round."

These arguments have led the journal Nature to warn this month that "a
battle is under way for the future of particle physics". Its analysis of
the views of dozens of leading physicists revealed that [**many** were
**critical** of the **proposed collider** and warned it could **trigger
dangerous divisions** between groups]{.underline}. The [**discontent**
has reached an **unprecedented pitch**]{.underline}, many researchers
told the journal Nature.

#### CERN management already [ruined]{.underline} their reputation back in [2001]{.underline}. [No]{.underline} recovery.

**Feder '01** \[Toni; December 1; Science writer at Physics Today at the
American Institute of Physics; American Center for Physics, "CERN
Grapples with LHC Cost Hike," 10.1063/1.1445534\] //jwh

[CERN **faults** the **original** budget for **not** having any
**contingency**]{.underline}. "[When the LHC was approved]{.underline}
in 1996," says Roger Cashmore, the lab's director of research for
collider programs, "\[[the]{.underline} governing\] [**council** gave
us]{.underline}, as an extra present, a [900 million Swiss franc budget
cut]{.underline}, so it was a very tough deal that we struck---to build
a new high-tech accelerator with a cut to personnel and money." (See
Physics Today, February 1997, page 58.)

[The **size** and **suddenness** of the price hike came as a
**shock**]{.underline}, say CERN scientists and council members, who
represent the lab's 20 member states. [**CERN** management]{.underline}
"**[didn't take the tight budget seriously enough]{.underline}**. This
is proved because they started new programs. [They **don't** have the
**mentality** of doing things at **cost**]{.underline}," says council
vice president Hermann Schunck, from Germany's research ministry.
"**[How did they get into this without warning us
earlier?]{.underline}**" [asks]{.underline} British [delegate Ian
Halliday]{.underline}, head of the UK's Particle Physics and Astronomy
Research Council.

Indeed, many high-energy physicists and policy-makers worry that the
[LHC overruns reflect **badly** on the **field** and could have **ripple
effects** on other **current** and **future** high-energy
projects]{.underline}. "**[What CERN has blown over the past few months
is its reputation for delivering on time and on budget]{.underline}**,"
says Halliday.

#### Management [stripped]{.underline} it of [any]{.underline} good back in [2001]{.underline}.

**Feder '01** \[Toni; December 1; Science writer at Physics Today at the
American Institute of Physics; American Center for Physics, "CERN
Grapples with LHC Cost Hike," 10.1063/1.1445534\] //jwh

The [LHC tab **swelled**]{.underline} in part [due to the **added**
costs of the **superconducting** dipole magnets]{.underline}---CERN
spent 150 million Swiss francs on unplanned prototypes, and magnet
assembly climbed some 180 million Swiss francs higher than expected.
(Sources close to the issue say the magnet makers inflated the prices.)
Then there were computing costs for developing a vast data grid (120
million Swiss francs); civil engineering problems encountered in digging
a cavern for the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS), one of the two main LHC
experiments (70 million Swiss francs); outside contractors (150 million
Swiss francs); a shortfall in money from nonmember states (50 million
Swiss francs); a rise in CERN's contribution to the LHC detectors (50
million Swiss francs); and assorted smaller items.

Of the new bill, only 480 million Swiss francs is for things specified
in the original LHC budget, says Director General Luciano Maiani. That's
an overrun of about 18%. The rest of the roughly 30% in extra costs was
supposed to be absorbed by CERN's general budget. "Though in absolute
terms it is a large amount of money, it's not such an unusual or
unforeseen thing," says Maiani. "I think that in the end, when we have a
new plan, people will realize that this is part of the normal fight of a
new big project."

With a combination of loans, austerity measures, and more money from
member states, says Maiani, "we should be able to cope." But it will be
tough: [Loans would put CERN's **future** in **hock**]{.underline}. As
for economies within CERN, [**belt-tightening** has already left the lab
**lean**]{.underline}. "**[There's not much to be had
there]{.underline}**," says Cashmore, "and a **[lot of
damage]{.underline}** could be [done to **good** programs]{.underline}."
[CERN is]{.underline} nonetheless [considering **slowing** or
**stopping**]{.underline} [its **non-LHC** programs]{.underline}, which
include the fixed-target and heavyion experiments at the Super Proton
Synchrotron, the Antiproton Decelerator, and a neutrino beam to Italy's
Gran Sasso National Laboratory.

While austerity measures are not likely to save much, they're necessary
to regain the trust of the CERN council. "It is important that \[CERN
management is\] seen to be making strenuous efforts to get back on
budget," says Halliday.

More money from member states would be the simplest solution for CERN.
An initial appeal for a 4% hike was not well received, but council
members seem open to a smaller increase.

High-energy physicists worldwide worry that the budget crisis will
postpone the LHC from starting in 2006. But Maiani says time will not be
used as a contingency to draw out payment. "We would like to insist on
that. A delay to ease the financial situation would not be acceptable,"
he says.

But many CERN scientists oppose sacrificing other experiments to the
LHC, especially given that they suspect its schedule will slip in any
case. "Building the LHC is the first priority, even to me," says
Friedrich Dydak, who is involved in planning a neutrino factory at CERN.
"But only half of the particle physics community wants to do LHC
physics. Therefore a world laboratory like CERN should retain attraction
also to the other half of the community." The LHC is the highest-energy
accelerator in the world, so it has no competition, he adds. "A delay
would be acceptable if there is a non-LHC physics program that can ease
the terrible prospect of not producing physics results for many years to
come."

The CERN staff is more split now than it was five years ago, when
members voluntarily accepted pay cuts and other belt-tightening measures
to accommodate the LHC's squeezed budget (see Physics Today, August
1997, page 51). This time, says one physicist, "**[there seems to be
little will on the side of the personnel to make more sacrifices in
order to bail out bad managers]{.underline}**."

[**Scandal-ridden** CAS]{.underline}

CAS has always been regarded as the highest level institution of science
and technology in mainland China. It has four nationally ranking
laboratories, 85 key laboratories, and 153 core stations throughout
China.

However, [the **state-run CAS**]{.underline} has recently been [involved
with **many scandals**]{.underline}. In June of this year, [more than
**90 scientists** holding **Ph.D.** and M.S. **degrees** **resigned**
from the]{.underline} Institute of Nuclear Energy Safety Technology
(**[INEST]{.underline}**) [in the **CAS**]{.underline} Hefei
[Institutes]{.underline} of Physical Science (CASHIPS). [Then the
**CCP's**]{.underline} State Council [sent a special working
group]{.underline} to CASHIPS, led by Vice Premier Liu He, [to
investigate the incident]{.underline}. But [after **more** than **50
days** of investigation]{.underline}, [CAS had **only handled** the
situation **internally**]{.underline}, [in a **low-key
manner**]{.underline}, [and the **director** **involved** is still in
his original post]{.underline}, Chinese media The Paper reported on
Sept. 3.

In July, [a **sixth-grader**]{.underline} from Yunnan Province [won the
**third**]{.underline} prize [at the **34th** C]{.underline}hina
Adolescents [Science]{.underline} and Technology [Innovation
Contest]{.underline} for his research on cancer. Later, [it was
**exposed**]{.underline} that [the boy's parents are **researchers**
at]{.underline} the Kunming Institute of Zoology of
**[CAS]{.underline}**, and it's believed that the student's research was
done with the help of his parents.

On July 3, **[Fu Xiangdong]{.underline}**, [a **professor** of cellular
and molecular medicine]{.underline} at the University of California, San
Diego, reportedly [accused **Yang Hui**]{.underline}, [a **researcher**
at]{.underline} the Institute of Neuroscience of **[CAS]{.underline}**,
[of **academic plagiarism**]{.underline}. Yang has also been selected by
China's Thousand Talent Program for youths.

In March, **[Xu Yufen]{.underline}**, [an **engineer** from]{.underline}
the South China Sea Institute of Oceanography of [CAS]{.underline}, [was
**banned** from **conducting research** because of her
**plagiarism**]{.underline} in an environmental study report on the
phase I project of Shenzhen Bay channel dredging.

In January, the Institute of Computing Technology of [CAS
claimed]{.underline} that [it **developed** its own programming language

But now, **[support for basic science and medical research is in danger
of flatlining]{.underline}**. We have witnessed a [**decline** in trust
for basic research]{.underline} in recent years. This has been
[accompanied by significant cuts in government financial support leading
to **sharp cuts** in **vital personnel** in critical scientific and
medical research programs at **universities**]{.underline},
**[laboratories]{.underline}**, [and **highly** regarded **medical** and
**scientific centers** throughout the country]{.underline}.

**[These cuts do not discriminate]{.underline}**. **[They are occurring

be imposed on smaller universities and research institutions in a wide
range of cities and regions.

[Those who **care** about America\'s global research]{.underline} and
technology leadership, [should be **alarmed** by the **deep
cuts**]{.underline} we are witnessing in research funding, [the
**firing** of personnel with **enormous** scientific

**attraction** of foreign scientists]{.underline}---many of [whom are
**critical** to our **healthcare** system]{.underline}, technological
[**innovation**, and **entrepreneurial**]{.underline} success.

For example, [**recent** budget proposals call for a]{.underline} 40%
[**cut** in funds]{.underline} for NIH, which would [lead
to]{.underline} similarly [**large terminations** in **vital** medical
research]{.underline} projects, and an over [**50% cut** in NSF
funding]{.underline}, **[which will mean terminations]{.underline}** in
critical STEM education programs. Fortunately, business has
significantly increased research and development over the last two
decades, but only a small fraction of that goes to critical early stage,
basic research.

"It's normal that a new administration will emphasize some areas,
de-emphasize others, and we would gradually transition to new
priorities. During the George W Bush administration there were
shenanigans around climate change, but it was nothing like this kind of
meddling in the scientific review process. You never just throw
proposals in the garbage can," said one [current NSF
staffer]{.underline}.

"Our [**mandate** is to **advance** science and innovation]{.underline}.
And [we just can't do that if we're **not** thinking about]{.underline}
diversifying [the]{.underline} Stem [workforce]{.underline}. **[We don't
have enough people]{.underline}** or diversity of thought without
broadening participation -- which is [part of the **NSF**]{.underline}
mission mandate," said a former program officer from the Directorate for
Computer and Information Science who recently accepted a buyout.

"**[It has been soul-sucking to see projects that went through the
review process being changed or terminated over and over
again]{.underline}**," they added.

The Federal Reserve estimates that government-supported research from
the NSF and other agencies has had a return on investment of 150% to
300% over the past 75 years, meaning US taxpayers have gotten back
between \$1.50 and \$3 for every dollar invested.

Trump's big, beautiful bill calls for a 56% cut to the current \$9bn NSF
budget, as well as a 73% reduction in staff and fellowships -- with
graduate students among the hardest hit.

Last week, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (Hud)
announced that it will be moving into the NSF headquarters in Virginia
over the course of the next two years. The shock announcement -- which
did not include any plans on relocating more than 1,800 NSF employees --
has triggered speculation that [the administration **eventually** plans
to **defund** the agency **entirely**]{.underline}.

**[The changes are hitting an agency already in crisis]{.underline}**.
In the past two weeks, [the NSF has **terminated**]{.underline} roughly
[**1,040 grants** that would have awarded]{.underline} US\$[**739
million** to researchers]{.underline} and their institutions. The
agency's director, Sethuraman Panchanathan, resigned last month.

[**Uncertainty** is]{.underline} also [being **felt** by
scientists]{.underline} outside the agency. Colin Carlson, an expert in
disease emergence at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, leads an
initiative to predict viruses that pose pandemic threats. The project,
which involves roughly 50 researchers across multiple universities, is
funded by a \$US12.5 million NSF grant. The project's latest round of
funding was approved, but Carlson worries about subsequent rounds, and
the fate of other researchers. Unless it is lifted, [the
**freeze**]{.underline} "[is going to **destroy** people\'s

[**Fresh turmoil** has hit the]{.underline} US National Science
Foundation ([NSF]{.underline}): [**hundreds** of the
agency's]{.underline} research [grants were **terminated**]{.underline}
today, adding to the hundreds already ended last week, Nature has
learnt. The new terminations come one day after [the agency's director
**abruptly resigned**]{.underline}, and NSF staff members were e-mailed
offers of incentives to retire early owing to "future restructuring,
staffing reductions, and constrained budget environments".

The departing director, Sethuraman Panchanathan, was nominated as head
of the NSF --- one of the world's leading funders of basic research ---
by US President Donald Trump in 2019, during his first term in office.

But now [Trump]{.underline}, in office for a second time, allegedly
[wants to **cut** the agency's]{.underline} US\$9-billion [budget by
**55%** and its workforce by **50%**]{.underline}, according to Science.
In a 24 April farewell letter to staff, Panchanathan wrote, "I believe
that I have done all I can to advance the mission of the agency,"
adding, "while NSF has always been an efficient agency, we still took
the challenge of identifying other possible efficiencies".

#### NSF [funding]{.underline} and scientist [numbers]{.underline} is collapsing.

//jwh

[In the past]{.underline}, [the NSF]{.underline} has [**usually**
enjoyed bipartisan support]{.underline} from both presidents and members
of Congress. But **[the ravages currently being inflicted upon the
agency may bring a truly golden era of American science to a
halt]{.underline}**. The February [dismissal of **168**]{.underline}
"probationary" [NSF employees included career scientists]{.underline}
newly arrived [from academic positions to work as program
managers]{.underline} familiar with the scientific disciplines they were
to oversee. Though some have been reinstated by court order, the
chilling uncertainty this ill-considered action instills in the NSF
workforce and its grantees can seriously harm U.S. science.

[The Trump forces]{.underline} now [direct]{.underline}ing [the NSF have
been **terminating** existing grants at a **record pace**]{.underline}
--- especially in such areas as climate science and educational
diversity, but also in chemistry, physics and materials sciences. In
2025, as compared with recent years, the NSF has so far awarded just
under \$1 billion in new grants, barely half the normal pace. Such
[cutbacks are **uniquely damaging** to younger scientists]{.underline},
[who]{.underline} often [**depend** on NSF]{.underline} fellowships and
[grants to **launch** their scientific careers]{.underline}. **[They
represent the future of American science]{.underline}**.

What's worse, the [2026]{.underline} fiscal year Trump [budget calls for
slashing **\$5 billion** from the current **\$9 billion** NSF
budget]{.underline}. That would be the death knell of the storied agency
as it has been known for decades --- coming at the very time when China
is increasing its support of basic research. The Trump forces want to
engineer a tremendous reduction in personnel and focus NSF activities
narrowly on applied research.

But where is the basic and early-stage research, for which the NSF is
world renowned? Such a limited, [**myopic** scheme will **severely
damage** U.S. science]{.underline} --- perhaps beyond repair.

### UQ\-\--Thumped\-\--2AC/1AR

#### Current cuts already [deck]{.underline} the biotech industry. That [destroys]{.underline} the pipeline of scientists and [delays]{.underline} action on research.

//jwh

Given the currently proposed [cuts to]{.underline} federal funding for
[scientific **research**]{.underline}, [including]{.underline} extensive
cuts to [the]{.underline} National Institutes of Health and
**[N]{.underline}**ational **[S]{.underline}**cience
**[F]{.underline}**oundation in the fiscal year 2026 budget, we believe
it is imperative --- and urgent --- to articulate that federal funding
for scientific research is essential to the sustainability of the
biomedical industry, maintaining the United States' technological edge,
and crucial for this country's ability to protect and strengthen our
economic and national security.

Damaging reductions in research funding provided to academic and federal
scientists will [immediately **hurt** the biotech]{.underline}nology
**[sector]{.underline}** in six key ways:

1\. Elimination of many graduate student training programs and
postdoctoral research positions will [reduce]{.underline} the [pipeline
of highly trained scientists]{.underline} we rely on to perform the work
within our companies.

2\. Cancellation of federal grants and contracts that directly support
companies (e.g., small business grants, service contracts, technology
development contracts) will [reduce our ability to develop
**innovative** products]{.underline}.

3\. **[Eliminat]{.underline}**ion of numerous
**[subcontracts]{.underline}** to our companies [to perform services
**required** for]{.underline} research (e.g., development of assays for
understanding, [diagnosing]{.underline}, and **[treating
disease]{.underline}**; [supply of]{.underline} specialized
**[research]{.underline}** equipment; [**clinical trial**
support]{.underline}; etc.) [will **delay**]{.underline} the
[introduction of **transformative** innovations]{.underline} to the
American public.

4\. **[Delay]{.underline}**s in [basic and clinical
**research**]{.underline} advances that create a pipeline for research
and development at our companies.

5\. **[Diminish]{.underline}**ed [resources for **new
spinoff**]{.underline}/startup [companies emerging **directly**
from]{.underline} academic [research]{.underline}.

6\. Reductions in purchase orders for research supplies, reagents,
personal protective equipment, etc., required for conducting scientific
research will decrease revenues and slow growth.

We together state that a reduction in federal research funding on the
scale currently contemplated for fiscal year 2026 will [have a
**catastrophic effect** on the **advancement** of biomedical and
**biotech**]{.underline}nology [capabilities]{.underline} in the United
States. Continued and robust federal funding of scientific research is
required to preserve the health of the U.S. scientific ecosystem,
allowing the U.S. to continue to lead the world in the advancement of
scientific innovation, knowledge, and health.

[Thanks to **budget** cuts]{.underline}, [[the U.S]{.underline}]{.mark}.
may be [becoming a [**less attractive** place to do scientific
research]{.mark}]{.underline} and develop new technology. At least,
that's a suggestion from Nature, which revealed that "[US [scientists

**abroad**]{.mark}]{.underline} between January and March 2025 than
during the same period in 2024." That follows the results of a poll last
month finding that [**[75%]{.mark}** of researcher **respondents** were
considering [looking for jobs in **Europe** and
**Canada**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Over the past few months, [[hundreds of]{.underline}]{.mark} NIH and
[[NSF grants have been **terminated**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and **new**
grants]{.underline} from the NIH [are **down** by about **\$2.3
billion** this year]{.underline}--a nearly one-third contraction. Leaked
budget proposals suggest that the Trump Administration is considering
massive cuts to scientific agencies, slashing budgets by as much as 50%.

This [**[turmoil]{.mark}** in basic research]{.underline} is also
[**[impacting]{.mark}** one of America's strengths]{.underline}:
[[attracting **talent**]{.mark} from abroad]{.underline}. 35% of all

### No Internal\-\--BioFoundries\-\--2AC/1AR

#### BioFoundries are [bottlenecked]{.underline}.

**Hanson '23** \[Andrew and Víctor Lorenzo; June 16; Eminent Scholar and
Professor at the Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, PhD in
Plant Physiology and BSc in Biochemistry and Botany from London
University; ACS Synthetic Biology, "Synthetic Biology─High Time to
Deliver?," 10.1021/acssynbio.3c00238

[A **central** promise]{.underline} of SynBio [has been to]{.underline}
"[**industrialize** biology]{.underline}" by combining engineering
principles such as computational design, standardization of parts,
modularity, and abstraction with assembly line technology [in the form
of **biofoundries**]{.underline}.24,28 This combination is surely
powerful and has been central to SynBio's rollout. [There
are]{.underline}
nevertheless--**[paradoxically]{.underline}**--[elements of both
**over**- and **under**-promising here]{.underline}. [The overpromising
stems from the **obvious** fact that only a certain]{.underline}, rather
[**narrow** set of biological problems can be solved by
**industrialized** implementation]{.underline} of the
design-build-test-learn cycle. [These]{.underline} problems [relate
**predominantly** to fermentations of some sort]{.underline} and to
individual enzymes. [While a biofoundry can **speed** up **initial**
development]{.underline} of microbes for, e.g., microbiome engineering,
[the process is **bottlenecked** at the **next** step when the products
have to **prove** their **worth**]{.underline} in farmers' fields or
patients' guts.29,30 Similarly, plants and animals do not reproduce
every 20 min or live in fermentation tanks. [The under-promising stems
from a]{.underline}n almost [trivializing **tunnel-vision** of what
**engineering** is]{.underline}: [it]{.underline} is not, and **[never
has been]{.underline}**, [**dependent** on computational **design** and
**standardized** parts]{.underline}, and even the most iconic SynBio
successes owe more to old-fashioned trial-and-error tinkering than to an
electronics-based vision of engineering.31,32 [**Overdominance** of this
chip-centric understanding]{.underline} of what SynBio is can [**limit
conceptions** of its **future** beyond the
**fermentor**]{.underline},33,34 which would be unfortunate. [The
**essence**]{.underline} of SynBio is to reimagine life processes and
even life itself as they might be, [subject to **thermodynamic** and
**kinetic** constraints]{.underline} but not to the frozen accidents of
evolutionary history.6,35 This can go beyond the typical efforts to
apply to live objects the engineering principles used to construct
complex devices by instead leveraging everything biological evolution
has invented through a different logic for solving multiobjective
optimization challenges.36

Lastly, we note that, [while **progress** has been
substantial]{.underline},37 the above points on [**falling short**
of]{.underline} SynBio [promises are **uncomfortably** close to those
made in **2010** in a **Nature** News Feature titled]{.underline}
'**[Five hard truths for synthetic biology']{.underline}**.38 This
article included the quote "**[The field has had its hype
phase]{.underline}**. Now it needs to deliver". A correctable reason for
hype's persistence is overspecialization, which is--and long has been--a
feature of PhD training.39 The capacity to see beyond disciplinary
boundaries to wider realities is part of engineering philosophy;25 it
confers something close to a superpower in a specialist world40---and it
can be taught.

#### BioFoundries are [not]{.underline} sustainable.

**Panda '22** \[Binay and Pawan Dhar; March; Researcher at the School of
Biotechnology at Jawaharlal Nehru University; Asian Biotechnology and
Development Review, "Running and Managing Shared Resources for
Scientific Research: A Model from Biofoundry," 0972-7566\] //jwh

[The **main** challenge of running a]{.underline} shared [facility is
its **sustainability**]{.underline}, both [in **human** resources with
**long-term**]{.underline} employment [**contracts** and **financial**
resources]{.underline} to run and maintain expensive equipment.
[Specific challenges in running]{.underline} and maintaining
**[extensive]{.underline}** shared [resources like
**biofoundries**]{.underline} are recently discussed \[8\]. In India,
the extramural grant system primarily funds scientific projects or to
initiates a facility but not towards maintaining or running the facility
long-term. This means that the grants allow hiring scientific staff
temporarily till a particular project is over. [The **only way** to
retain human **resources**]{.underline} or provide long-term employment
contracts in a facility [is for the host organization to **absorb** the
staffing once the **short- term** projects are over]{.underline}.
However, [this is **not easy**]{.underline} under the current system due
to the following reasons:

#### BioFoundries are [risky]{.underline}, [costly]{.underline}, and [unpredictable]{.underline}.

**Moretti '25** \[Débora, Natalie Laibach and Stefanie Bröring; March

bioeconomy and the innovation process with the emergent concept of
biofoundries," 10.4337/9781800373495.00014\] //jwh

Still, [biotechnology]{.underline}-based [products]{.underline}, [due to
their **complexity**]{.underline} and biological nature, [present a
**higher** set of variables that **influence**]{.underline} economic
[value and make **outcomes** more **unpredictable**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline}, [thus]{.underline}, **[riskier]{.underline}**. Many
processes conducted in a biorefinery need microorganisms, and it is
still hard to predict whether they will perform as expected. As a
result, the success of the bioeconomy and the evolution of biotechnology
tools are interconnected (Lopes, 2015). This is an example of how other
types of facilities, such as biofoundries, come into play. With the help
of bioinformatics and robots, a biofoundry aims to design, build, and
test synthetic microorganisms in a fully automated high-throughput way
(Holowko et al., 2021). This workflow, combined with artificial
intelligence, enables the biofoundry to become more efficient, thus
maturing into an important asset in accelerating the bioeconomy through
biodesign principles (Farzaneh and Freemont, 2021).

However, [such promises **do not come** without]{.underline} hurdles or
**[challenges]{.underline}**. [Biofoundries are **very
resource-intensive**]{.underline}, especially when it comes to
investments. [**One** facility]{.underline} may [require]{.underline}
10--[**15 million** euros to be set up]{.underline}, [considering
**equipment** alone]{.underline} (Holowko et al., 2021). Furthermore,
[this **very** interdisciplinary **concept** requires **specialised**
personnel]{.underline}, [which the world is **still** to
**educate**]{.underline} and train.

#### BioFoundries [don't]{.underline} have the personnel [nor]{.underline} the automation capability to [function]{.underline}.

**Moretti '25** \[Débora, Natalie Laibach and Stefanie Bröring; March

bioeconomy and the innovation process with the emergent concept of
biofoundries," 10.4337/9781800373495.00014\] //jwh

[While biofoundries **seem** to offer a solution]{.underline} to many
issues related to speed, automation, and upscaling, [there are still
**many challenges** to be overcome]{.underline}. First, as it is now
understood, [biofoundries require a **high investment** that can reach
**dozens of millions** of euros **only** for infrastructure]{.underline}
as mentioned above. In this regard, some initiatives aim to design the
"open source biofoundry" to significantly reduce upfront investment.
Second, [reproducibility]{.underline} may be both the goal and [the
**bottleneck** of a biofoundry]{.underline}. T[o reach a level of
**automation** that guarantees a **minimum** of variance]{.underline}
and yet enough flexibility to handle different projects, [**months of
tests** need to be conducted]{.underline}. Third, [the necessary
**expertise** to operate a biofoundry is still being
**developed**]{.underline}, which calls for investment in
interdisciplinary education. Biofoundries unite software development,
robotisation, and micro- or molecular biology in a way never seen
before. Lastly, [**due** to their **service-based** model]{.underline},
[biofoundries **need business**]{.underline} or network
**[managers]{.underline}**, [whose tasks go **far beyond**]{.underline}
those of common [lab]{.underline}oratory [managers]{.underline}. In
order to serve both incumbents and start-ups, many [biofoundries face
**bottlenecks** related to personnel]{.underline} that can bring new
clients (or partnerships) to the group. While private biofoundries have
more clear and established goals that guide their activities, many
non-profit biofoundries are still understanding the best way for them to
operate while facing the above-mentioned challenges Those challenges
will be further explored in the next subsections.

#### They [cannot]{.underline} retain employees.

The attraction and retention of talent. [Biofoundries require
**long-term** investments **not** only due to their **high
demand**]{.underline} for consumables and equipment maintenance [but
because of their **very specialised** personnel]{.underline}. A result-
or market-orientated mindset, [the **ability** to work in a]{.underline}
multi- and [**cross-discipline** environment]{.underline}, on top of the
specific knowledge required by the biofoundries (microbiology, software
engineering, or robot automation, for instance), [are]{.underline}
competencies [**not highly available** in the marketplace]{.underline}.
With short-term [contracts]{.underline} and lower payments,
non-commercial biofoundries [usually **lose** trained **personnel** to

Definition of a goal. As fluid as the concept itself, [the **main** goal
of]{.underline} established [biofoundries seems to **exist only around
their tech**]{.underline}nologies. The [**difficulty** of establishing
reproducible workflows **surpasses** the **purposes** of a

laboratory. [This is **especially true** when looking at
**sustainability**]{.underline}. [The **dedication** of the foundry to
**solving** sustainability issues is normally **not clear**]{.underline}
in their description, indicating that such potential is still to be
explored. If the automatisation of biological engineering is to

[Further technical issues]{.underline}. Among others, Chao et al. (2017)
[highlight]{.underline} the [**poor development** of automation
instruments and **corresponding** software]{.underline}, due to small
demand. Indeed, the market is still beginning to be filled with supplier
companies, although it is evolving. The challenge of this initial market
also relates to communication among instruments: to secure clientele,
robots from different brands normally do not work together. However,
[beyond **standards** and **collaboration**]{.underline} between
companies, [the **integration** of **multiple** platforms
requires]{.underline} the [**creation** of specialised
algorithms]{.underline}. Not only in the test phase but mainly during
learning and design, powerful algorithms [remain **bottlenecks** for
further **development**]{.underline}. The increasing use of digital
tools, especially machine learning in the laboratories, indicates that
such a problem is advancing, although [it **needs more
support**]{.underline} (Zhang et al., 2022). This calls attention to one
important point (or red flag) for policymakers, to support specialised
education and training.

### No Impact\-\--Scientific Leadership\-\--2AC/1AR

#### Scientific leadership is at an [all-time]{.underline} [high]{.underline}.

**HG '25** \[Hudson RPO; March 20; Made up of experts within the
industry across the Americas, EMEA and APAC regions, provides critical
business insights in the form of research reports; Hudson RPO, "Future
Outlook: What's Next for Life Sciences Leadership?,"
hudsonrpo.com/blogs-articles/future-outlook-whats-next-for-life-sciences-leadership\]
//jwh

[The **demand** for life sciences **leadership** has reached
**unprecedented heights**]{.underline}, [with January **2025** seeing a
**40%** year-over-year increase in job postings]{.underline}---a surge
that marks the [**highest growth** in the past 12 months]{.underline}
according to Hudson RPO Executive Search findings. As the industry
continues to evolve, this increase in leadership demand raises an
important question: is this growth sustainable, or is it merely a
temporary anomaly?

Given the factors driving this surge, [the **outlook** for life sciences
leadership appears to be **optimistic**]{.underline}. [The **consistent
rise** in executive compensation]{.underline} since September 2024 is a
[**clear indicator** of the **tightening** talent
**market**]{.underline}. [Advertised salaries]{.underline} for
director-level to C-suite positions [have steadily
**climbed**]{.underline}, [underscoring the **increasing
competition**]{.underline} for top leaders and the recognition of their
critical role in guiding organizations through an increasingly complex
landscape, as shown from the Hudson RPO Market Dashboard. With this, [we
can expect **long-term demand** for skilled executives]{.underline} in
the life sciences sector.

Looking ahead, organizations must be prepared to navigate several key
trends that are shaping the future of life sciences leadership. These
trends not only reflect the current market dynamics but also hint at
where the industry is headed over the next few years.

1\. Faster Hiring Cycles: Top Executives Placed in Record Time

[The **pace** of **leadership** hiring has **accelerated**]{.underline},
[with]{.underline} top-level [**executive roles** being filled at an
**unprecedented speed**]{.underline}. As organizations compete for a
limited pool of highly qualified candidates, the hiring process has
become more time sensitive. For companies, this means that swift
decision-making is essential to secure the right talent before
competitors do. Leadership teams that can streamline their hiring
processes, make quicker decisions, and offer competitive compensation
packages will be the ones that emerge as winners in this talent race.

Moreover, the pressure to fill executive positions quickly does not
diminish the need for thorough vetting. Companies must continue to
[**ensure** that the **leaders** they bring on board are **not only
qualified** but also **aligned** with their **organizational** culture
and **long-term** strategic **goals**]{.underline}. The ability to
balance speed with quality will be a key factor in successful
recruitment strategies moving forward.

2\. [**Increasing** Competition]{.underline} for Specialized Roles

Certain areas [within the life sciences **industry**]{.underline} are
seeing [particularly **high demand** for **leadership**
talent]{.underline}, and [this trend is **expected** to **continue**
well into 2025]{.underline} and beyond. Roles in oncology, regulatory
affairs, and medical affairs are especially competitive, with companies
vying for executives who possess specialized expertise in these fields.
The complexity of modern scientific developments in these areas,
combined with the ever-evolving regulatory environment, necessitates
leaders with deep knowledge and experience.

For instance, [the **push** for **personalized** medicine]{.underline}
and targeted therapies in oncology has [created a **growing need** for
leaders who not only understand the scientific nuances but can also
**navigate** the **regulatory hurdles**]{.underline} that come with
these innovations. Similarly, as regulatory bodies worldwide tighten
compliance and reporting standards, organizations are seeking leaders
who can guide them through these complex regulatory frameworks.

The demand for specialized leadership in these areas will continue to be
a defining characteristic of the life sciences job market. Companies
that are targeting these high-demand roles must be proactive in their
talent acquisition strategies, focusing on building relationships with
top-tier candidates in niche areas and offering competitive compensation
to attract them.

3\. A Shift Toward Digital and AI Expertise

One of the most significant shifts in life sciences leadership is the
increasing importance of digital and AI expertise. As the industry
becomes more reliant on data analytics, automation, and artificial
intelligence to drive innovation, organizations are actively seeking
leaders who can harness the power of these technologies. From improving
drug discovery and clinical trials to optimizing supply chain
operations, AI and digital tools are transforming how life sciences
companies operate.

Leaders who understand the potential of these technologies---and who
have a proven track record of implementing data-driven strategies---will
be in high demand. The ability to guide organizations through digital
transformation will be one of the most sought-after leadership qualities
in the coming years. As a result, life sciences executives with
experience in AI, machine learning, and data analytics will be integral
to shaping the future of the industry.

Furthermore, leaders who can bridge the gap between scientific
advancements and business strategies will be crucial. As digital tools
become more integrated into the core functions of life sciences
organizations, executives will need to be adept not only in science and
technology but also in business management to ensure that digital
transformations are strategically aligned with organizational goals.

4\. The Importance of Cultural and Organizational Fit

While technical expertise and experience remain crucial, an increasing
focus is being placed on the cultural and organizational fit of leaders.
As the landscape of life sciences organizations evolves, the ability of
executives to foster collaboration, innovation, and adaptability will be
paramount. Leaders who can navigate change, drive organizational
transformation, and build strong teams will be essential in maintaining
a competitive edge.

In a time when industry disruption is the norm, companies must
prioritize leaders who can adapt to shifting market conditions, lead
diverse teams, and cultivate a strong, forward-thinking organizational
culture. As such, the recruitment process for life sciences leadership
will continue to evolve, with an emphasis on assessing not just
technical skills but also the ability to drive change and inspire a
high-performance culture.

The Road Ahead: Will the Surge in Demand Continue?

As we move further into 2025, the life sciences industry is at a
crossroads. [The **increased demand** for leadership
talent]{.underline}, [driven by **industry growth** and
innovation]{.underline}, [shows **no signs of slowing
down**]{.underline}. However, whether this surge is a temporary anomaly,
or [the **beginning of a sustained trend**]{.underline} remains to be
seen. The next few months will be critical in determining whether the
current level of demand will become the new normal for life sciences
leadership.

### No Impact\-\--Pandemics\-\--2AC/1AR

#### Pandemics [cannot]{.underline} cause extinction. It's statistically [impossible]{.underline}.

**ÓhÉigeartaigh '25** \[Sean; March 7; Executive Director of Cambridge's
Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, Co-I on CSER's research
project, PhD in genomics; Cambridge University Press, "Extinction of the
human species: What could cause it and how likely is it to occur?,"
10.1017/ext.2025.4\] //jwh

[It is]{.underline} considered **[very unlikely]{.underline}** that
[a]{.underline} naturally occurring [pandemic]{.underline} 7 [would be a
**primary** cause of]{.underline} human **[extinction]{.underline}**
(Ord, 2020), and the author is aware of **[no credible work presenting
plausible pathways]{.underline}**. Such [a disease would need both to
spread to nearly **all humans**]{.underline} across the world [and be of
extremely **high** lethality]{.underline} or cause infertility at
extremely high rates. However, it seems plausible that pandemic disease
could play a contributing role in combination with other factors in an
extinction scenario.

A common concern is that advances in the biological sciences and
biotechnology could enable the creation of more dangerous viruses and
other forms of biological agent than exist in nature (Millett and
Snyder-Beattie, 2017). Biological weapon development and use are
prohibited under the Biological Weapons Convention; however, leading
states have developed major biological weapons programmes in the past,
and it is conceivable that such directions might be pursued in future or
are presently being pursued clandestinely (Riedel, 2004). Further,
advances in these sciences lower the barrier to entry to the development
of dangerous agents in terms of cost, expertise and equipment needed,
potentially bringing globally catastrophic capabilities within the reach
of small groups in future. While [groups willing to bring
about]{.underline} global catastrophe or even [extinction would
b]{.underline}e expected to be **[rare]{.underline}**, there have been
notable examples of groups motivated by near-apocalyptic ideology such
as the Aum Shinrikyo cult, 8 which attempted to weaponise Anthrax and
carried out successful local nerve agent attacks (Lifton, 1999; Torres,
2016). Gopal et al. (2023) outline two scenarios leading to
civilisational collapse: a "wildfire" scenario in which one or more
pandemic agents leads to disruption of food, water, power supply and law
enforcement and a "stealth" scenario in which an initially asymptomatic
agent with long incubation time is spread to a majority of humanity.
They consider both scenarios most likely to involve accidental or
deliberate release of human-modified agents. Direct targeting of humans
is only one plausible pathway to global harm; Monica Schoch-Spana et al.
(2017) note the potential pathogens targeting widespread eradication of
food sources; and other forms of environmental harm are plausible.

The capability to re-engineer biology more fundamentally may create
unprecedented risks. In 2024, a group of leading biological scientists
called for a halt to research to develop "mirror bacteria," designed to
have an opposite chirality to that of all forms of existing life
(Adamala et al., 2024). The group argues that it is likely these
synthetic life forms would both resist predation and bypass immune
systems in humans, animals and plants, potentially leading to risk "of
unprecedented scope and scale" due to invasive spread and widespread
lethal infection.

While robust likelihoods are not possible here, Millett and
Snyder-Beattie (2017) deem [the **likelihood** of **full human
extinction**]{.underline} primarily [from a **bioweapon** or
**engineered** biological agent]{.underline} as "**[extremely
low]{.underline}**" but not ruled out, although Ord (2020) estimates as
high as 1 in 30 for the coming century. Again for extinction, scenarios
involving one or multiple pathogens in combination with other factors
may be most plausible.

\<\<\<TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>\>

Nuclear war The most credible global catastrophe scenarios resulting
from nuclear war involve large-scale nuclear weapon exchange bringing
about a catastrophic climate effect known as a nuclear winter. In these
scenarios, smoke from burning cities, industrial facilities and
oilfields enters the upper atmosphere, disrupting sunlight for a period
of years and leading to wide-scale crop failures and famine.
Disagreement exists between scientific teams modelling the climatic
impact of nuclear exchanges. Xia et al. (2022) estimate that over 2
billion people could die from nuclear war between Pakistan and India and
over 5 billion between Russia and the USA. However, Reisner et al.
(2019) predict more limited generation and dispersal of soot, leading to
less severe outcomes. The size of nuclear warhead arsenals has been
reduced from a combined global peak of over 70,000 in the 1980s
(Kristensen and Norris, 2013), but \~12,512 still exist, with the USA
holding 5,244 and Russia holding 5,889 (Kristensen and Korda, 2023).
Recent years have seen increasing geopolitical tensions between nuclear
powers, heightening of political rhetoric around nuclear weapons use,
the non-renewal of key treaties such as New START (Williams, 2023) and
the development of new technology that might upset strategic balance
(Bajema and Gower, 2022), leading to concerns that the risk of nuclear
war remains high. A nuclear war appears unlikely to bring about
extinction directly, but would severely undermine global ability to
respond to other threats. Artificial intelligence Three plausible
pathways to global catastrophe mediated by artificial intelligence (AI)
have been proposed (Hendrycks et al., 2023). The first relates to AI
being used by humans to enact more powerful offensive warfare than in
previous history or contributing to military escalation scenarios (Maas
et al., 2023). The second relates to AI accelerating development of
other sciences and technologies such as bioscience (Sandbrink, 2023)
relative to human understanding and governance, increasing any risks
posed by these developments. The most discussed scenario, and that most
directly linked to human extinction, involves the development and
subsequent loss of control of artificial general intelligence (AGI) with
autonomy and superhuman cognitive and strategic planning ability. The
creation of AGI that is fully aligned with human goals and values is
considered by many AI scientists a key challenge for future AI
development (Russell, 2019); a highly capable system that was not fully
aligned might, for example, perceive human oversight as an obstacle to
be bypassed and pursue actions (for example, large-scale modification of
the Earth's environment) that might lead to human extinction as a result
of indifference to human survival. A rapidly growing number of research
leaders consider the development of AGI feasible in coming decades or
even years, and an open letter signed by many leading technologists in
2023 stated "Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a
global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics
and nuclear war." 9 The topic remains controversial, with many research
leaders considering such outcomes highly unlikely. 10 A recent survey of
2,778 AI authors found that between 37.8% and 51.4% (depending on
framing of the question) of respondents gave at least a 10% probability
to advanced AI causing human extinction or an equivalently bad outcome
(Grace et al., 2024). Physics experiments and unknown future
technological developments Concerns have been raised that particle
physics experiments might have the potential to create consequences that
could destroy the Earth: for example, creating a black hole, strangelets
11 or triggering a phase transition that would rip the fabric of space
(Rees, 2021). According to Rees, the most favoured physics theories
imply that the risks from such experiments "within our current powers"
are zero; however, alternative theories imply the possibility of these
catastrophic outcomes. Collisions between cosmic ray particles of much
higher energies occur frequently without catastrophic consequence,
offering some evidence against such concerns (Hut and Rees, 1983). Kent
(2004) discusses and critiques risk analysis estimates for the RHIC
supercollider, for which probabilities of catastrophe ranged from 10−5
to 2 × 10−8 (Dar et al., 1999; Jaffe et al., 2000). Concerns have also
been raised about theorised but as yet undeveloped technologies such as
atomically precise manufacturing (Phoenix and Drexler, 2004). More
generally, many scholars have noted that some of the most powerful and
potentially destructive technologies have been developed relatively
recently in human history (Rees, 2003; Bostrom, 2013; Ord, 2020). Given
expectations of continued scientific advancement, it is likely that
as-yet undeveloped technologies will pose catastrophic risks in coming
decades and centuries and plausibly represent the greatest direct risk
of human extinction. Multiplicative stresses and civilisational
vulnerability

A common theme across many of the risks discussed is that they may cause
global catastrophe but are unlikely to wipe out the human species in
isolation. However, it is realistic to expect that some catastrophes may
trigger further catastrophic consequences across the categories above or
otherwise occur in combination. [The **severity** of]{.underline} some
**[past major mass extinctions]{.underline}** likely [resulted from
**reinforcing interactions** between **multiple** stresses]{.underline},
some playing out over thousands of years. The Permo-Triassic saw a
cascade of global warming, ocean acidification and anoxia, and methane
and hydrogen release Bond and Grasby (2017). The Cretaceous-Paleogene
saw the catastrophic consequences of the Chixhulub impact devastating a
global environment already stressed by the Deccan Traps (Keller, 2012).

Returning to modern times and shorter timescales, Kareiva and Carranza
(2018) argue that "it is the interconnections of stresses and the way we
respond to environmental shocks that promulgates the greatest
existential risk.". Rees (2003) draws attention to the fragile nature of
global supply chains: a catastrophe that resulted in higher order
impacts, such as disruption of power and food supply chains, would
quickly render cities uninhabitable. A civilisation reeling from one
catastrophe might also be less resilient to further threats: a planet
reeling from nuclear war may not be able to muster the resources to
embark on a project to divert an asteroid. Nonetheless,
**[total]{.underline}** human [**extinction** remains a **very high
bar**]{.underline}, [even for **multiple** of these **threats** in
**combination**]{.underline}.

Analysing overall civilisational vulnerability and higher-order impacts
of global-scale catastrophes is challenging. There is growing work in
this direction. Baum and Handoh (2014) propose a "Boundary Risk for
Humanity and Nature" framework that combines concepts from global
catastrophic risk and the planetary boundaries framework. This
intersection is further explored in studies addressing the relationship
between the sustainable development goals and existential risk (Cernev
and Fenner, 2020) and the role of planetary boundary breach in global
catastrophe scenarios (Cernev, 2022). Jehn (2023) examines the role of
planetary boundary breach in exacerbating or mitigating the cascading
impacts of nuclear war.

Liu et al. (2018) present a taxonomy of existential hazards grouped by
how global vulnerability and exposure to the hazards plays out. Avin et
al. (2018) analyse severe global catastrophic risk mechanisms by
critical systems affected, global spread mechanism and prevention and
mitigation failure. Cotton-Barratt et al. (2020) propose a three defence
layer model against extinction-level catastrophes, focusing on
prevention, response and resilience. Kemp et al. (2022) outline a
research agenda around climate-triggered catastrophes and societal
fragility. Maher and Baum (2013), MacAskill (2022) and Belfield (2023)
explore factors that might contribute to either extinction or recovery
following a civilisational collapse. Drawing on a range of concepts in
systemic risk, Arnscheidt et al. (2024) argue that emergent properties
of the global system make important contributions to the risk of global
catastrophic outcomes, noting that a focus on hazards in early global
catastrophic risk research critically neglects factors such as
amplification and vulnerability. Further valuable insights are likely to
come from collaboration between existential risk, systemic risk and
collapse research. 12

Estimating the unprecedented

I have used the term "estimate" in this review for expert assessments of
extinction risks posed by hazards ranging from novel bioweapons through
to physics experiments. These assessments are provided by scholars with
substantial expertise, but there is frequently limited empirical
evidence to draw on. Research on human extinction invariably involves at
least one of three methodological challenges that make the assignment of
robust probabilities difficult (for an analysis of likelihood estimation
methods for existential hazards, see Beard et al., 2020). A first
category of risks involves extremely rare events, where there is limited
evidence to go on. A second category relates to entirely unprecedented
developments, for which we must often primarily draw on experts'
subjective judgements. A third challenge relates to scenarios involving
multiple interacting risks or trends; the complexity of these scenarios
makes them challenging to assign likelihood to. Plainly put, humans are
quite different from other species. We have no similar extinctions to
draw on and so must fumble in the dark with what we have.

In The Precipice, Toby [Ord judges the **overall likelihood** of an
**existential** catastrophe]{.underline} in the coming century
[at]{.underline} about **[one in six]{.underline}**. This figure is
itself informed by subjective judgements across a range of individual
risks where certainty is not possible. Ord caveats the purpose of these
judgements as showing "the right order of magnitude, rather than a more
precise probability"; even so, it would be reasonable to regard them as
incorporating some element of guesswork given the presently unknowable
nature of many of the informing variables. [The **majority** of Ord's
overall estimate is contributed by Ord's estimate of a one in ten
**likelihood** of extinction from unaligned AI]{.underline}, [with
**engineered pandemics** and **other anthropogenic** risks]{.underline}
making up most of the remainder. [Even with these **latter**
categories]{.underline}, [Ord's **estimates**]{.underline} have been
critiqued as being [**too high** for climate]{.underline}- [and
engineered pandemic-caused extinction]{.underline} (Thorstad, 2023a,
2023b). However, Ord's overall estimate is similar to that derived from
a 2008 survey of global catastrophic risk experts, which provided an
overall risk of extinction of 19% prior to 2,100 (Sandberg and Bostrom,
2008). The majority of this survey's overall risk estimate was also
linked to emerging or future technological development. [These
are]{.underline} also **[subjective estimates]{.underline}**, and the
previous discussion applies.

[Using the fact]{.underline} that [humans]{.underline} have
[survived]{.underline} at least **[200 kyr]{.underline}**, [we can
infer]{.underline} that [the **annual** probability of]{.underline}
human [extinction from natural causes is **less than 1 in
87,000**]{.underline} with modest confidence (0.1 relative likelihood)
[and **less than 1 in 14,000** with near **certainty**]{.underline}
(10−6 relative likelihood). **[These are the most conservative
bounds]{.underline}**. Estimates based on older fossils such as the ones
found in Morocco dated to 315 kya result in annual extinction
probabilities of less than 1 in 137,000 or 1 in 23,000 (for relative
likelihood of 0.1 and 10−6 , respectively). Using the track record of
survival for the entire lineage of Homo, the annual probability of
extinction from natural causes falls below 1 in 870,000 (relative
likelihood of 0.1). We also conclude that these [data are **unlikely**
to be **biased** by observer selection efects]{.underline}, especially
[given]{.underline} that [the **bounds** are consistent with **mammalian
extinction** rates]{.underline}, the [**temporal** range of other
**hominin species**]{.underline}, [and the **frequency** of
**potential** catastrophes and **mass** extinctions]{.underline}.

The bounds are subject to important limitations. Most importantly, they
only apply to extinction risks that have either remained constant or
declined over human history. Our 200 kyr track record of survival cannot
rule out much higher extinction probabilities from modern sources such
as nuclear weapons or anthropogenic climate change. Some naturally
occurring risks could be also be worsened by anthropogenic factors: a
minor asteroid impact could be interpreted as a nuclear attack and lead
to retaliation54, or a naturally occurring disease which previously may
have only been a local extinction risk could spread much further due to
modern travel23. In the cases where a natural risk is amplifed by modern
conditions, we can still derive some partial information from the upper
bound by evaluating how much the risk would need to change from the
purely natural baseline. For example, [the claim]{.underline} that [a
natural **disease** poses a **greater** than **1 in 1,000** chance of
extinction **per year** would require]{.underline} that
[**anthropogenic** conditions have **increased** the **risk** of natural
disease by a **factor** of **more** than **14 to 870**]{.underline}
(under our most conservative and optimistic upper bounds, respectively).
In general, for a naturally occurring risk to violate our upper bounds
via human activity by more than a factor of two, the majority of the
risk would still need to come from anthropogenic circumstances.
