### Acknowledgments & File Notes

Thanks to Aadi, Alex, Maria, Pau, Raj R., Rajveer, Savanna, Serena, and
Tate for their help on this NEG DA file (&AFF Answers at the bottom of
the file)!

This DA would be better against AFFs that are "mean" to Russia rather
than AFFs that attempt to create cooperation with Russia (are "nice" to
Russia).

The story of the DA is:

- U.S.-Russia relations are improving now

- The plan upsets Russia which causes relations to collapse

- US-Russia relations would be good to solve various possible extinction
  level impacts --- warming, space, etc.

Russian President Vladimir [[Putin **lauded**]{.mark} US President
Donald [Trump for **progress in US-Russia
relations**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Emphasising that [the relations
between Russia and the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [were **beginning
to improve** and **stabilise**]{.mark}]{.underline}, Putin credited
Donald Trump for this progress.

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} 72-year-old [Russian [President
**praised**]{.mark} Donald [**Trump** for his efforts
to]{.mark}]{.underline} end the war in Ukraine and [[**improve ties**
with Russia]{.mark} and called him a "very courageous
person\"]{.underline} who "survived two assassination attempts.\"

While addressing a press conference in Minsk, [Vladimir
Putin]{.underline} expressed gratitude and [said]{.underline}, \"In
general, [[thanks to]{.underline}]{.mark} President [[Trump, relations
between Russia and the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [are **beginning
to level out**]{.mark}]{.underline} in some ways,\" Reuters reported.
[[Reiterating]{.mark} that he had [\"**great respect**\" for the US
President and declaring]{.mark} his [**willingness** to meet]{.mark}
Trump]{.underline}, Putin said that the meeting was \"quite possible\"
but would require careful preparation. Vladimir Putin added, \"Not
everything has been decided in the sphere of diplomatic relations, but
[the first steps have been taken and **[we are moving
forward]{.mark}**.]{.underline}\"

This follows Putin\'s interest in fresh round of direct peace talks in
Istanbul on Russia and Ukraine conflict. During the upcoming meeting,
the terms of a potential ceasefire are expected to be on the agenda,
Putin said while speaking to reporters during a visit to Belarus.

"[Putin made some very nice statements today]{.underline}," Reuters
quoted Donald Trump as saying. After Vladimir Putin lauded the 47th
United States President, [Trump said, "Putin respects our
country.\"]{.underline} He further noted that leaders of other US
adversaries respect the US, including Chinese President Xi Jinping and
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, AP reported.

**[[The Benefits of]{.mark} Restoring [Diplomatic
Relations]{.mark}]{.underline}**

With the agreement fully restoring diplomatic functions, a new chapter
in **[[U.S.-Russia relations]{.underline}]{.mark}** has begun. This move
**[[carries]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[significant
benefits:]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Ending the Ukraine Conflict on Russian Terms: The Riyadh talks indicate
a shift toward a realistic resolution of the conflict in Ukraine. With
President Trump prioritizing diplomacy over prolonged military
engagement, the conflict is likely to conclude in a manner favorable to
Russia. This means Ukraine will not join NATO, and Russia's territorial
gains will be acknowledged.

Erosion of NATO's Influence: With the U.S. signaling a reduced
commitment to European security, NATO's role is set to diminish. This
shift aligns with Russia's long-standing objective of limiting Western
military presence near its borders.

Economic Revival: The resumption of diplomatic ties is expected to lead
to the lifting of sanctions, allowing Russia to reintegrate into global
trade networks. This will benefit energy markets, stabilize commodity
prices, and foster economic cooperation.

**[[Enhanced Strategic Cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}**: The
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[and Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[have common interests

**[[Terrorists]{.mark} might [leverage]{.mark} the existing
[capabilities]{.mark} of states [to bring]{.mark} about existential
harm, in what we refer to as [an]{.mark} indirect [existential
attack]{.mark}. This form of existential terrorism aims to trigger a
sequence of actions that culminates in the manifestation of a direct
existential threat. The most likely candidate in this regard is indirect
nuclear terrorism.]{.underline}**

i\. Nuclear weapons

Even if **[terrorists]{.underline}** eventually succeed -- through theft
or indigenous production -- in acquiring their own nuclear weapons, they
will not plausibly be able to secure sufficient numbers to pose an
existential threat. The remaining option is to exploit state arsenals
and thus bring about a global nuclear war. **[There are two main
pathways to catalyse nuclear war. The first, technical, path involves
[infiltrating]{.mark} nuclear weapon
[c]{.mark}ommand[-and-c]{.mark}ontrol systems and either launching
multiple weapons or [spoofing]{.mark} the [system to]{.mark} ensure that
one or more states [launch]{.mark} their own [arsenals]{.mark}. The
second, political, path seeks to [manipulate]{.mark} social and
political systems [to induce]{.mark} states to engage in
[large-scale]{.mark} nuclear [exchanges]{.mark}. These are not mutually
exclusive, and many scenarios along these lines involve a combination of
both paths.]{.underline}**

**[Scenarios of [tech]{.mark}nical [exploitation]{.mark} by terrorists
of nuclear arsenals usually [involve]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[terrorists launching some sort of [cyberattack]{.mark} that gives
them access to secure nuclear systems]{.underline}**. **[Although among
the best-protected systems in the world, nuclear [facilities]{.mark} in
general [are]{.mark} believed by many to be [vulnerable]{.mark} to
cyberattack, with so-called "air-gapping" from external networks not
always maintainable in practice.]{.underline}** The increasing
automation and networking of infrastructure generally are also likely to
affect even the most secure systems, like those protecting nuclear
weapons, while **[the [capabilities]{.mark} [of]{.mark} malevolent
[hackers are continually increasing]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The most
extreme result of such digital intrusions would be for terrorists to
gain control of operational nuclear weapons. There is extensive debate
surrounding the security of so-called NC3 (nuclear command, control and
communications) systems, where, for instance, many experts argue that
the US arsenal is relatively secure (perhaps because of its rather
antiquated technology), but this is not necessarily the case for other
countries with less robust controls, such as Pakistan.

Even if terrorists do not succeed in gaining enough control of systems
to launch the nuclear weapons, there remains the possibility that they
will gain sufficient access to spoof early-warning systems and thus
provoke a catastrophic inter-state nuclear exchange. There have long
been concerns with these early-warning systems (and several historic
near-misses from false alarms), with particular concern focused on "Dead
Hand" systems like those ostensibly used by Russia Footnote48 and some
concern given to China's space-based early-warning system. If **[a
[terrorist]{.mark} group or even individual could [covertly
trigger]{.mark} these systems by simulating, say, an [impending]{.mark}
missile [strike]{.mark} and convince a state that an enemy nuclear
attack was in progress (especially if this is accompanied by additional
forms of disinformation), this could [lead]{.mark} the state [to
erroneous]{.mark}ly [launch]{.mark} its own first strike. Beyond the
cyber dimension, even sending up physical objects like weather balloons
might lead states with less sophisticated early-warning capabilities to
initiate a counterstrike. Decisions to allow the autonomous launching of
nuclear weapons using artificial intelligence would likely increase
these risks due to the brittleness of the artificial
intelligence.]{.underline}**

**[While existing controls such as permissive action links probably
minimise the possibility of a single insider launching a nuclear weapon
on their own, cyberthreats can be facilitated if the terrorist
[actor]{.mark} manages to [obtain an insider]{.mark} within the nuclear
weapons infrastructure. Insiders can bridge the air gap or [open]{.mark}
the proverbial [digital doors to cyberintruders]{.mark}, or at the very
least they can provide valuable information that assists a cyberattacker
in circumventing defences. Great strides have been made in detecting
insiders and preventing insiders from accessing nuclear weapons
complexes in countries like the USA, but these systems are far from
perfect, not to mention that other nuclear-weapon states might have less
robust insider threat controls.]{.underline}**

**[On the more political side, terrorists could manipulate a state into
launching their nuclear arsenals against another state by convincing the
military or political leadership that there is strategic advantage in
this. The terrorist would likely need to mount [a "false-flag"]{.mark}
operation, where the terrorist group perpetrates an attack with large
political and social consequences on a nuclear-weapon state and [plants
false evidence]{.mark} that a rival state was behind the attack. Recent
technological developments that provide new tools for disinformation,
ranging from ["deep fakes" to]{.mark} even intentionally triggering
[radiation detectors]{.mark}, could facilitate such operations. Engaging
in this type of behaviour in two or more states that are already both
nuclear armed and engaged in a tense geopolitical rivalry would only
heighten the risk. If a terrorist group were to get their hands on [even
a single]{.mark} nuclear [weapon]{.mark} and use it in a false-flag
attack, this would presumably enhance their odds of success, but even
sizeable or symbolic conventional attacks in a suitably tense
environment might be able to [precipitate]{.mark} inter-state
[nuclear]{.mark} [war]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

both in favour of meeting in person and will assign their teams to work
on preparing a meeting, Ushakov said, but no venue has been agreed.
Asked if the lifting of U.S. sanctions had been discussed, Ushakov said:
\"You know, Trump mentioned that the Senate, in principle, has a bill

sanctions, but rather of reaching some agreements.\" Ushakov stressed
the warm nature of the conversation, saying **[[the two]{.mark} [men

**[[The relations between the US and Russia are "highly
significant]{.underline}]{.mark}**," Japan said on Thursday after a
phone call between Presidents Donald Trump and Russian President
Vladimir Putin.

"It is too early to present our views, but US and Russian relationship
is highly significant, so we will continue to follow that," top
government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters in Tokyo.

"A fair and perpetual peace in Ukraine should be realized as soon as
possible," he said, according to a recording of his news conference.

"The government is monitoring the situation with great interest."

The statement from Tokyo came after **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** on
Wednesday said he **[[had a \"lengthy and highly productive\"
conversation with Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and that their
delegations agreed to "start negotiations immediately" to end the nearly
three-year Ukraine war.

He also spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Trump later told reporters that he and Putin could soon meet in Saudi
Arabia for Ukraine peace talks.

The phone calls came after US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said a
return to Ukraine\'s pre-2014 borders -- when Russia annexed Crimea -
was unrealistic and that the US does not see NATO membership for Kyiv as
part of a negotiated settlement to end the conflict.

Hayashi refrained from commenting on Hegseth's statement.

Following the Trump-Putin phone call, China on Thursday lauded the
meeting between Washington and Moscow, emphasizing a peaceful end to the
war in Ukraine.

"Russia and the US are influential major powers, and **[[we are happy to
see Russia and the US strengthen communication and dialogue on a series
of international issues,"]{.underline}]{.mark}** Foreign Ministry
spokesman Guo Jiakun told reporters in Beijing.

**[[TO RUSSIA, WITH LOVE: The U.S. and Russia took a major step toward
softening relations]{.mark}]{.underline}** between the frequent
adversaries in talks today **[[in Saudi Arabia]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
In **[[the most detailed negotiations in more than three years, the
Trump admin]{.mark}istration [signaled a sea
change]{.mark}]{.underline}** from the past few years of the West
seeking to isolate and punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for
invading Ukraine.

Three **[[major outcomes:]{.underline}]{.mark}** Secretary of State
Marco Rubio told AP's Matthew Lee and Dasha Litvinova that he, Russian
counterpart Sergey Lavrov and other officials agreed to 1)
**[[normalize]{.underline}]{.mark}** and build back staffing at their
respective embassies; 2) **[[work more closely
together]{.underline}]{.mark}** on diplomatic ties and economic
investment; and 3) create formal senior teams for peace talks in the
Ukraine war.

It's the last plank that is most controversial, of course, not least
because Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wasn't there. National
security adviser Mike Waltz and Rubio indicated that the U.S. would
consult with Ukraine and European allies but negotiate directly with
Russia, WSJ's Michael Gordon reports, which the continent would surely
find unacceptable. But Rubio emphasized that nobody was being excluded.
Notably, Waltz also told CNN's Jennifer Hansler that whether Russia can
keep land it has seized in the past three years will "be discussed."

Rubio and Lavrov cast the conversations as fruitful --- "**[[we not only
listened, but also heard each other]{.underline}]{.mark}**," said the
Kremlin's man --- but just the beginning of a lengthy process. The Trump
administration views the rapid steps toward negotiations on Ukraine as
an essential path to achieve peace and save lives, as President Donald
Trump campaigned on; critics worry that it'll amount to capitulation to
Moscow, or an imperialist substitution for Ukrainian decision-making.

What the talks didn't produce yet: **[[a Trump-Putin
summit]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Though **[[both sides are working toward
that]{.underline}]{.mark}**, no date or details have been ironed out
publicly. Rubio also said it was too soon to talk about lifting U.S.
sanctions on Lavrov.

**[[It was "a head-spinning reset" of U.S.-Russia ties]{.mark} that had
plunged to a nadir of several decades during the war]{.underline}**,
NYT's Anton Troianovski and Ismaeel Naar write from Riyadh. And
Zelenskyy reacted angrily, postponing his trip to Saudi Arabia until
next month. Back in Moscow, Russia erected harder-line demands, saying
NATO must go back on a 2008 pledge to admit Ukraine in the future and
can't be involved in peacekeeping efforts, per Reuters' Dmitry Antonov
and Guy Faulconbridge.

**[Russia has also displayed an effective use of soft power in its

accomplished a goal for Russia, which was to have Georgian and Ukrainian
NATO bids terminated. The war with Georgia also highlights Russian
attempts to control a narrative for Eastern Europe and the Balkans. The
U.S. and British led NATO military actions against Serbia in the 1990s
relegated Russia to the sidelines where it had to watch an ally
eventually surrender to the wishes of the international community. In
2008, a much more assertive and influential Russia could do little to
dissuade the United States from acknowledging an independent Kosovo. 22

Accessed: 5/21/25)

**[[As a state that does not share a coastal border with the Arctic,
China's attempts to expand its influence have been
limited.]{.underline}]{.mark}**\[84\] It has focused on geoeconomics to
increase its regional presence--including making investments in Russian
Arctic's LNG projects as well as in Greenland, 5G partnerships with
Icelandic companies, and scientific research. China has built two
icebreakers and is working on building a nuclear-powered one, with the
potential for dual-use. Beijing is aware that maritime connectivity
between Europe and Asia via the high North can reduce its Malacca
Straits dilemma and give it access to crucial resources while saving
time and costs for the transport of goods. Western sanctions on Russia
have also led to greater interaction with China in the region, both as a
consumer of resources and as an investor. Indeed, the US 'Strategic
Blueprint for the Arctic' clubs the two countries together, arguing that
regional peace and prosperity will increasingly be challenged by Russia
and China.\[85\]

However, **[[the growing closeness between Russia and China does not
necessarily translate into a partnership in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Unlike the US and Russia, **[[China is
not geographically located in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but has
announced the Polar Silk Road as part of its flagship Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI).\[r\] **[[Contrary to China's proclamation of itself as
a "near-Arctic" state]{.underline}]{.mark}**, \[86\] **[[Russia insists
on the primacy of the coastal Arctic Five. As a non-Arctic state,
Beijing has not been able to claim a role in the governance of the
region]{.underline}]{.mark}** but sees itself a stakeholder that must be
involved in shaping the Arctic agenda.\[87\] However, Russia has not
been willing to allow non-Arctic states, including China, to take an
upper hand in either economic or security domains. The imposition of
western sanctions on Russia, which limited the activities of its
companies in oil and gas exploration projects, has paved the way for
Chinese investment into Arctic projects like Yamal LNG and Arctic LNG 2.
However, **[[Russia has been careful in maintaining a diversified
portfolio of investors]{.underline}]{.mark}** and retaining the
controlling stake.\[s\],\[88\]

**[[Russia's and China's positions on Arctic issues have also diverged
over the years]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This is evident in the case of
NSR, where China is wary of developing the route alongside Russia, lest
it signal support for the latter's domestic control over the
connectivity link.\[89\] While Moscow treats the NSR as part of its
territorial waters where Russian rules apply, the Chinese white paper
calls for the application of UNCLOS and "general international law", and
that freedom of navigation be observed on all shipping routes in the
Arctic.\[90\] Just as China cites UNCLOS to call for freedom of
navigation, Russia too, relies on the international treaty to make its
case for regulating navigation and claiming sovereignty over NSR
rulemaking. It focuses on the exception provided to ice-covered areas
under Article 234 for its claims, placing it at odds with China.
Interestingly, China diverges from its own assessment of freedom of
navigation in the case of South China Sea. It uses the argument of
"exceptionalism and historical argument" to make its case within the
nine-dash line but is reluctant to allow the same argument to hold in
the case of the NSR.\[t\],\[91\],\[92\]

Moreover, Chinese shipping companies are also biding their time to
ascertain the profitability of the route, with only COSCO operating in
the NSR. **[[Russia and China have also not shown signs of any joint
policy on the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Indeed, as mentioned
briefly earlier, they have different interests in the region and their
perspectives on Arctic developments and governance could point to
disagreement in spite of cooperation on specific projects.\[93\]

Overall, analysts are of the view that Russian behaviour in the Arctic
reflects its desire to be a "status-quo power".\[94\] China has
signalled enhanced ambitions through the release of its 2018 White
Paper. For now, it is expanding its influence by building bilateral
relations with Arctic states, through its position as an observer in the
Arctic Council and building its infrastructure capacities in the region.

nonetheless added that the two **[[have closed communication channels

Peskov also disputed the US's remarks on a potential regime change in
Iran by saying it should be determined by the Iranian people, not third
parties, but stopped short of criticizing the attack.

The statement conflicts with Russia's foreign ministry on Sunday, which
condemned the strike by calling it "irresponsible" and said it "grossly
violates international law."

Macron and Merz urge stronger EU defense, more aid to Ukraine, and unity
against Russia's aggression in a Financial Times op-ed ahead of the NATO
summit in The Hague.

Russia, a key ally of Iran that signed a partnership treaty with Tehran
earlier this year, previously warned Washington against military
intervention in Iran but stopped short of vowing direct support for Iran
should it come under attack.

**[[One country that did not feature on]{.mark} Donald [Trump\'s list of

US outlet Axios quoted White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt as
saying this was because existing US sanctions on Russia \"preclude any
meaningful trade\" and noting that Cuba, Belarus and North Korea were
also not included.

However, nations with even less trade with the US - such as Syria, which
exported \$11m of products last year according to UN data quoted by
Trading Economics - were on the list.

The US imposed large-scale sanctions on Russia after its full-scale
invasion of Ukraine in 2022. **[[Trump has generally taken a friendlier

could [become an alternative market for goods for countries with U.S.
tariffs]{.mark}]{.underline}**. According to the economist,
**[[Russia]{.mark} could [benefit greatly from this if it could also
offer competitive goods and services in the emerging
markets.]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Gazeta.ru, 04.03.25)

Tatyana Rybakova, Russian journalist, wrote: "It is possible that duties
for Russia will be determined at the ceasefire talks---Putin's special
representative and secret billionaire Kirill Dmitriev has already
arrived in Washington, and Steve Witkoff is flying there, too. It is
also possible that particularly brutal duties have been prepared for
Russia---in case of its intractability, although the trade turnover
between the two countries is laughable. Option: duties will be
introduced for buyers of Russian goods, even if they are not supplied to
the USA." (MT, 04.03.25)

Kirill Seleznev, Moscow-based Garda Capital stock market expert, said:
"The decline in trade turnover will reach every country in a chain
reaction, as was the case during the Great Depression of the 1920s.
Countries then also tried to 'protect' their domestic market from their
neighbors and competitors. As a result, we saw hyperinflation in Germany
and famine in the USSR, although the crisis initially started in
America, and nothing foreshadowed that it would spread further."
(Gazeta.ru, 04.03.25)

Kirill Shcherbakov, a senior lecturer at the Department of Economic
Theory and Behavioral Economics at Synergy University, said: "For
Russia, the new tariffs could create additional difficulties. Despite
the sanctions, the U.S. remains an important economic partner for the
Russian Federation, and any reduction in global demand could hit Russian
exports. Russia traditionally exports such goods as metal, fertilizers
and energy to the U.S. \... The main blow could fall on the oil sector."
"A reduction in social spending, a weakening ruble and an increase in
inflation---this is what this could lead to," he warned. Shcherbakov and
other Russian economists stressed that the fall in oil prices due to new
U.S. tariffs will entail the threat of a reduction in Russian budget
revenues and a deterioration in the dynamics of economic growth in the
Russian Federation. (Gazeta.ru, 04.03.25)

Mikhail Vasiliev, chief analyst of Russia's Sovcombank, sees
**[[benefits for Russia in the deterioration of relations between China

U.S.-China relations may lead to some improvement in
Russia-U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline}** and Russia-China
**[[relations]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Warming relations with the U.S.
may strengthen Russia\'s negotiating positions with China and other
countries (India, etc.). Discounts on Russian raw materials may begin to
decrease, which will have a positive effect on Russian exports and the
ruble. And the weakening of control over compliance with sanctions by
the U.S. may improve external payments and logistics in the trade of
Russian goods, which is a positive factor for the ruble and a factor in
slowing down inflation,\" the expert concluded. (Gazeta.ru, 04.03.25)

Vermont, 2025 ("NEWS: Sanders Statement: Meet Donald Trump's New Best
Friend, Vladimir Putin," March 3,
https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/news-sanders-statement-meet-donald-trumps-new-best-friend-vladimir-putin/
Accessed: 5/22/25)

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today released the following statement
introducing the American people to the background and history of Russian
dictator, and apparent **[[ally of]{.underline}]{.mark}** President
**[[Trump,]{.underline}]{.mark}** Vladimir
**[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

**[Donald Trump's attacks on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky are
a gift to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump is dividing the
Western alliance, and undermining Ukraine's defense against Russia's
invasion. His actions may prolong the war by convincing Putin he can
manipulate Trump into a deal with concessions he couldn't win on the
battlefield.]{.underline}**

**[[Trump is cozying up to]{.mark} Vladimir
[Putin]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- so, who is Putin?

Putin is a former Soviet spy who spent 16 years in the KGB, where he
learned how to manipulate people by playing on their egos, greed and
fears. After the end of the Cold War, Putin was named head of the FSB,
Russia's post-KGB intelligence agency. In 1999, Putin was named Prime
Minister, becoming president when former President Yeltsin unexpectedly
resigned. Putin has ruled Russia ever since.

At the heart of Putin's rule are two forces: corruption and violence.

As Russia's new leader, Putin, who is now believed to be one of the
wealthiest people on earth, consolidated power at home by reining in
Russia's powerful oligarchs. He offered them a simple deal: If they
granted him absolute power and shared the spoils, he would let them
steal as much as they wanted from the Russian people. The result: while
the vast majority of the Russian population struggles economically,
Putin and his fellow oligarchs stashed trillions of dollars in offshore
tax havens. In the process, Putin crushed Russia's brief movement toward
democracy. He eliminated rivals, cracked down on freedom of speech, and
strangled the free media. Political dissidents, investigative
journalists, and opposition leaders started turning up dead.

Today, 26 years after he took power, Putin is the absolute ruler of
Russia. Russian elections are blatantly fraudulent, with Putin's lackeys
barely hiding their ballot-stuffing. In the last sham election, Putin
won 88 percent of the "vote" against carefully screened opposition
candidates.

That is **[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}**'s Russia. There is no freedom
of speech. Protests are violently suppressed. Tens of thousands of
people are in imprisoned for speaking out against his rule. The bravest
and most prominent dissidents -- people like Alexei Navalny, Boris
Nemtsov and Sergei Magnitsky -- are murdered outright. And the
billionaire oligarchs become even richer.

That **[[is the leader Trump defends and admires.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

But it's not just repression at home. Putin has also engaged in four
brutal wars: in Chechnya, Georgia, Syria and Ukraine (twice). In
Chechnya, his forces targeted civilians and medical personnel,
flattening entire cities. Against Georgia, he launched an unprovoked
invasion and annexed 20 percent the country. In Syria, Russian aircraft
bombed schools, hospitals and crowded markets, killing thousands of
civilians to prop up the brutal dictator Bashar al-Assad. And in
Ukraine, Putin has invaded twice, first in 2014 and then again in 2022.

Right now, Russia occupies about 20 percent of Ukraine. Because of
Putin's invasion, over one million people have been killed or injured.
Every single day, Russia rains down hundreds of missiles and drones on
Ukrainian cities. Putin's forces have massacred civilians and kidnapped
thousands of Ukrainian children, bringing them back to Russian
"re-education" camps. These atrocities led the International Criminal
Court to issue an arrest warrant for Putin in 2023 as a war criminal.

**[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}** has also directly attacked the United
States and its allies, repeatedly hacking our computer systems,
attempting to sabotage critical infrastructure, meddling in our
elections and harassing our diplomats.

**[That [is]{.mark} Donald [Trump's new best
friend]{.mark}]{.underline}**, Vladimir Putin.

**[[Every American]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- regardless of his or her
political views -- should **[[see the current reality
clearly]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For the first time in American history,
we have a president who is prepared to turn his back on our democratic
allies and democratic values to align himself with one of the world's
most brutal dictators.

#### US exploration in the Arctic derails relations and risks Russian military retaliation

Research Establishment (FFI), 2014 ("Russian-Western Relations in the

Accessed: 05/20/25)

**[Six years ago, [Russia]{.mark} adopted an [ambitious national
strategy for the Arctic region]{.mark}. The strategy was aimed at
turning the region into a strategic resource base for the Russian
Federation by 2020, and at [preserving the country's role as a leading
Arctic power]{.mark}. [The implementation of the strategy has been
accompanied by a gradual increase in Russia's military activity in the
Arctic]{.mark}. Russia's naval presence in the northern waters is higher
today than it was in the 1990s and early 2000s, on the surface as well
as under water]{.underline}**, and Russia has since August 2007
conducted numerous long-range bomber flights in the international
airspace over the Barents Sea, the Greenland Sea, and other parts of the
Arctic. In Russia, this activity is largely seen as a "response" to
measures taken by the other Arctic coastal states, all four of which
happen to be NATO members.¶ The four other Arctic coastal states --
Canada, the United States, Denmark, and Norway -- are following
developments in the Russian Arctic with a heightened sense of awareness.
Like Russia, the four attach considerable importance to their economic
and national security interests in the region, as reflected in their
Arctic/Northern/High North strategies, adopted in 2006--2011. Some are
concerned that the growing industrial and commercial activity in the
Arctic (ship traffic, petroleum activities, fisheries, cruise tourism
etc.) may have adverse impacts on the environment, particularly in the
event of a large oil spill. Others are concerned that disagreements over
borders and jurisdiction may lead to a deterioration of interstate
relationships in the region. Still others are concerned that the renewed
international interest in Arctic affairs, among Arctic as well as
non-Arctic states, will lead to an incremental militarization of the
region, and that this may eventually undermine the political and
military stability that currently characterizes the circumpolar Arctic.¶
As of today, Russia and the other Arctic coastal states do not seem to
have a proper forum where they can discuss military security issues and
concerns related to the Arctic. Russia is neither a NATO member nor part
of the Western security community. The NATO-Russia Council has so far
not been able to serve as an arena for NATO-Russia dialogue on Arctic
security. The same goes for the Arctic Council, which is not seen by
either party as a forum in which "hard" (military) security issues can
or should be discussed. **[[Russian-Western relations in the Arctic are
still marked by a largely lacking sense of trust and
confidence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. On top of that, [recent developments
in Ukraine's Crimea region are likely to have a negative impact on
Russia's relations with the EU and NATO]{.underline}, at least for some
time.¶ [**[Russian policymakers and media have]{.mark} in recent years
had [a tendency to portray any foreign military activity in the Arctic
as hostile and provocative, even when such activity]{.mark} takes place
well outside the country's territorial waters or airspace and [does not
infringe on recognized Russian rights]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The
**[[Russians are concerned that foreign state or non-state actors may
try to take control of natural resources and/]{.mark}or [shipping lanes
rightfully belonging to]{.mark} the [Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}**n
Federation. According to a recent statement by Nikolai Patrushev,
Secretary of the Russian Security Council, the United States, Norway,
Denmark, and Canada are pursuing "a common and coordinated policy aimed
at denying Russia access to the riches of the Arctic continental shelf".
In a somewhat similar manner, Canada's Prime Minister, Stephen Harper,
has stated on several occasions that his country faces "increasingly
aggressive Russian actions", necessitating adequate defensive measures.¶
Obviously, statements such as the ones cited above are often intended
for domestic audiences and should not necessarily be taken at face
value. At the same time, there are many indications that the security
concerns are genuine, and that fear is a factor in Arctic politics also
in 2014. Many Arctic states are concerned that their neighbors or
outside actors may attempt to infringe on their rights and interests,
including the access to natural resources or shipping lanes of
considerable value to their national economies. None of the states that
surround the Arctic Ocean exclude the possibility of interstate disputes
in the region, and none of them are willing to rely on anyone except
themselves to protect their northern maritime borders, sovereignty, and
sovereign rights.¶ For Russia as well as for other Arctic rim states,
the stakes are undoubtedly high. It is estimated that some 30 per cent
of the world's undiscovered reserves of natural gas, and 13 per cent of
the undiscovered reserves of oil, are located north of the Arctic
Circle. Among the areas specified for future development are Russia's
Yamal Peninsula in northwestern Siberia and the continental shelf in the
Barents and Kara Seas. In a more distant future, petroleum operations in
areas further north and east may become a reality. Russia will soon
claim ownership to a shelf area of 1.2 million square kilometers
(460,000 square miles) between the outer limits of the country's current
200-nautical-mile economic zone and the North Pole. Efforts are also
taken to facilitate an increase in ship traffic along the northern coast
of the Eurasian continent. The annual number of passages along this
northern waterway is still fairly modest (71 in 2013), but cargo volumes
are growing year by year.¶ The Arctic coastal states' security concerns
on the northern frontier are shaped not only by the region's emerging
role as an arena for economic and industrial activity, but also by the
region's place in the nuclear deterrence strategies of Russia and the
United States. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union and the United
States developed long-range nuclear weapons that could be launched
across the Arctic Ocean, either from locations on land, from the sea, or
from the air. The number of deployed warheads has been reduced
significantly since then, but all elements of the nuclear triads are
still in operation and thus relevant to the security situation in the
region. The weapons have also become more sophisticated, most notably
with the development of land- and sea-based anti-ballistic missile (ABM)
systems, particularly after the collapse of the ABM Treaty regime in the
early 2000s. The latter development is likely to remain a source of
contention between the United States and Russia, which sees sea-based
ABM systems as a potential threat to its nuclear deterrent in the
Arctic. ¶ When developing strategies to cope with future threats that
might arise, security analysts [**[have a tendency to "assume the
worst]{.mark}**"]{.underline}, that is, scenarios that do not
necessarily reflect the current state of affairs. Not knowing the
(future) intentions of their neighbors or outside actors, they are
afraid to risk shortfalls in military capability, and may therefore
chose to "play it safe". Based on their own interpretation of other
actors' intentions and military potential, they may advocate measures to
strengthen domestic military capabilities. Once implemented, these
measures may be perceived by other states as potentially threatening,
and lead to military or other counter-measures. In the International
Relations literature, this phenomenon is often referred to as "the
security dilemma".

**[This [lack of trust among Arctic states stems both from the fact that
policies have been pursued without consultation with the other Arctic
states, and from the still often strained relations between Russia and
the West]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The former is not necessarily difficult
to change, but the latter may take longer to overcome. In essence,
relations between Russia and the West are going to see ups and downs
until the day that Russia eventually joins the Western security
community. A security community can be defined as an arrangement among
the states of a certain geographical area according to which they no
longer see military force as an option for any conflicts that may arise
between them. A transformation of this community to include Russia,
however, will not take place until Russia becomes a liberal democracy
and shares the West's other main political values. However, the fact
that Russian membership in the Western security community is not on the
cards today, does not mean that work to build confidence is futile. The
level of trust between states that do not belong to the same security
community can also be successfully increased through a variety of
measures. For instance, despite Norway's NATO membership and the
considerable skepticism with which Russia views this organization, the
level of trust among the two countries is today at an historic high.
This resulted from the two countries, Russia and Norway, being willing
to set aside some of their differences in order to achieve common ground
on issues of mutual concern. The third factor that sparks the conflict,
the military sensitivity of the Arctic, is likely to remain an issue for
the foreseeable future. As long as the nuclear powers feel that nuclear
weapons are vital to their mutual deterrence capability, **[[Russia in
particular]{.mark} will be [skeptical of anything that risks impinging
on its ability to maneuver its sea and air-based]{.mark} nuclear
[capabilities in the north.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[The United States has been jealous of [Russia]{.mark}'s [attempts to
project its dominance in the energy sector]{.mark} and has sought to
limit opportunities for Russia to control export routes and energy
deposits outside Russia's territory. But [the Arctic shelf is something
that Russia has traditionally regarded as its own. For decades]{.mark},
international powers have pressed no claims to Russia's Arctic sector
for obvious reasons of remoteness and inhospitability, but no longer.
Now, as the world's major economic powers brace for the battle for the
last barrel of oil, it is not surprising that the United States would
seek to intrude on Russia's home turf. [It is obvious that Moscow
would]{.mark} try to [resist]{.mark} this [U.S. intrusion and would view

**[[Moscow]{.mark} often [frames its]{.mark} foreign and domestic
[policies as defensive]{.mark} responses to perceived threats, [aiming
to protect]{.mark} its national [interests]{.mark} and legitimate its
assertiveness. As such, the [Kremlin's]{.mark} actions provide a window
into its [insecurities]{.mark}. These are [particularly acute in the
Arctic]{.mark}, where [concerns over]{.mark} nuclear [military
vulnerabilities]{.mark} and the capacity to extract Arctic resources
have massively [influenced Russia]{.mark}'s policy
rationale.]{.underline}**

**[Military insecurity]{.underline}**

**[Russia's [relations with Western countries]{.mark} in the Arctic have
been [entangled in]{.mark} a "[security dilemma]{.mark}" for over a
decade: actions taken by one state to enhance its security often lead to
countermeasures by others, [fueling]{.mark} a cycle of [tension and
militarization]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[While the EU has focused more on a peaceful agenda related to climate
and Indigenous issues, the [US and]{.mark} some [NATO]{.mark} member
states have been [developing]{.mark} their [military]{.mark}
capabilities [in]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark} in response to similar
actions by the Kremlin. For example, since 2022, the [US expanded NATO
military exercises]{.mark} and infrastructure upgrades in Alaska, while
Norway has undertaken comparable efforts to bolster its Arctic defence
posture using its own military base. Such Western actions have only
[increased Russia's]{.mark} perceived [military
insecurities.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[In particular, Russia's [main]{.mark} military [insecurity]{.mark} in
the Arctic [stems from]{.mark} the Kremlin's nuclear deterrence
strategy. A significant share of Russia's nuclear arsenal is deployed on
Arctic-based [submarines]{.mark}, which [form the core of]{.mark} its
[second-strike]{.mark} [capability]{.mark}. Russia's [ability to
deploy]{.mark} these submarines in the northern seas [while remaining
undetected]{.mark} by foreign forces is [key to]{.mark} its nuclear
[deterrence]{.mark} strategy. As a result, the Kremlin views Western
reconnaissance, research and patrols as potential threats aimed at
detecting these assets.]{.underline}**

**[The alarming rate of Arctic ice melt in recent years has further
fuelled Russia's anxious reactions. The reduction in ice cover along
with the [development of modern acoustic and radar methods]{.mark} can
help [reveal]{.mark} previously [hidden]{.mark} Russian [submarines,
increasing their vulnerability]{.mark}. Ice melt also brings broader
security concerns for the Kremlin. As navigation becomes easier,
Russia's vast northern coastline is losing its natural defence barrier.
Moscow increasingly [fears]{.mark} this may [weaken]{.mark} its Northern
Fleet's [ability to deter]{.mark} a conventional [Western attack]{.mark}
from the north, [prompting]{.mark} further [militarization]{.mark} of
the region.]{.underline}**

\<\<CONDENSED NONE OMITTED\>\>

Economic insecurity. The second insecurity shaping Russia's Arctic
policy is over the perceived threat to its ability to safely and
effectively extract oil and gas. Russian officials frequently cite that
around 80% of the country's natural gas and 17% of its oil reserves are
located within the Russian Arctic zone. The Kremlin has even dubbed the
Arctic as its "resource base of the 21st century". However, over
two-thirds of these reserves---particularly those located offshore---are
hard-to-cover and inaccessible due to technological limitations. At the
same time, fields with more accessible extraction---mostly located in
other regions of Russia---are gradually being depleted. For a country
that relies on oil and gas for 20% of its GDP, this is an existential
issue. In response, Russian state companies actively sought partnerships
with international firms to develop Arctic projects---fully aware of
their dependence on foreign technology and despite tightening
regulations on foreign investment in the Arctic. One frequently
highlighted success story was the cooperation between Rosneft and
ExxonMobil in the Kara Sea, which gave Russia access to technologies for
deepwater drilling. This collaboration was widely publicised in Russia,
along with Putin's personal involvement, as a major strategic win.

\<\<CONDENSED NONE OMITTED\>\>

**[That trajectory changed dramatically in 2014 when the US and the EU
imposed sanctions on Russia after its illegal annexation of Crimea.
These included restrictions on the export of technologies and equipment
critical for Arctic resource development, effectively stopping or
delaying parts of Russian Arctic projects and shutting down joint
ventures like the one with ExxonMobil. The sanctions were a targeted
blow to Russia's ability to develop energy reserves, a move which the
Kremlin saw as "clearly aggressive". In the aftermath, a sense of
strategic vulnerability and paranoia intensified among Russian
officials, built on the idea that the West is pursuing a policy of
taking Russia's natural resources.]{.underline}**

**[Having a meltdown]{.underline}**

**[The Kremlin's growing insecurities about Russia's military and
resource capabilities have deepened]{.underline}** significantly since
the invasion of Ukraine. The accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO has
left Russia effectively "encircled" by the alliance's members in the
Arctic. This intensified its feelings of vulnerability, as did the 2022
sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines. Although Russia had already
halted gas deliveries through the pipelines, the attack exposed its
inability to secure critical infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. In 2024,
a successful Ukrainian drone strike on the Olenya airbase---located
above the Arctic Circle and home to Russia's strategic bomber
aircraft---dealt another blow to Kremlin confidence.

In parallel, Western sanctions targeting Russia's Arctic projects have
intensified since 2022, with the 17th EU package adopted in May 2025.
They have largely focused on a deep insecurity for Russia: liquefied
natural gas (LNG). But the Kremlin has little room for manoeuvre against
these measures. It has promoted projects like Arctic LNG 2 as
replacements for lost pipeline gas exports to Europe. But Western
countries have imposed successive sanctions aimed at undermining the
project's viability including blacklisting the operating company,
restricting access to LNG ice-class tankers and targeting tanker
operators. As a result, despite reported efforts by Russia to circumvent
some of these restrictions on Western equipment, the timeline for Arctic
LNG 2 has repeatedly been delayed.

**[These events have hastened the security dilemma in the Arctic.
[Russia]{.mark}n officials now [interpret]{.mark} nearly [all NATO
activity]{.mark} in the region [as threatening and]{.mark} a "potential
[prelude to direct confrontation]{.mark}" while they widely [perceive
America's]{.mark} [Arctic as]{.mark} overtly ["confrontational"]{.mark}
and Western sanctions as a targeted offensive.]{.underline}**

**[Robert Papp's press briefing in March 2015 was followed by a Q&A,
where he discussed Russia's increased military presence in the Arctic
for the first time since 2008. To the question whether the US would also
increase its military presence in response to the Russian military
build-up, Papp answered that the Russian developments did not worry him
yet, and that there was no increase in military activity as a response
by the US yet. However, he also responded that the [US]{.mark} was
[creating]{.mark} an implementation [plan for]{.mark} the build of
[military vehicles]{.mark}, [airports and harbors]{.mark}, but that
"those are rightful things that people should be doing when they have
responsibilities for maritime safety and security" (para. 21).
Essentially, he responded that the US was [indeed increasing military
activity]{.mark} in the region, but indicated that this is not in
response to Russian activity. However, the sudden increased military
activity is remarkable, since this was not mentioned before- nor in
America's 2013 strategy.]{.underline}**

**[Despite Papp's de-securitizing claims, [Russia interpreted America's
increased military activity as a threat]{.mark}. In a dialogue in 2017,
[Putin stated]{.mark} the following in reaction to the American
increased military activity: "The United States, which is our neighbor
in the Arctic, is also developing its military activity. We think its
[military activity does represent a threat]{.mark} to us, because what
we are doing is local in nature \[in Crimea\], but what they are doing
in [Alaska is global in scale]{.mark}" (para. 148). This statement
contains some clear securitizing speech acts, referring to
[interpretations of America's actions as dangerous and threatening to
Russia's military]{.mark} security, [and]{.mark} the corresponding
warning for global conflict, which securitizes American behavior as a
large threat to Russia's [national security]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Arctic, by underscoring that its local nature.

[Alaska is the Arctic region which allows the United States membership
on the Arctic Council]{.underline}. Today, Southeast Alaska includes the
Central Council Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska (Tlingit &
Haida), numerous village tribes organized under the Indian
Reorganization Act, and the Metlakatla Indian Community of Annette
Island Reserve (Tsimshian), although the ancestral territory of the
panhandle of Southeast Alaska belongs to the Tlingit. In this region,
**[[Native]{.mark} people[s]{.mark} [rely]{.mark} heavily [on
fishing]{.mark}, hunting, and subsistence harvesting as a source of food
security, economic industry, and as part of the cultural fabric.
Southeast Alaska is home to one of the few temperate rainforests in the
world, spanning across roughly 17 million acres, and although this
region is experiencing climate change, there is very little information
at hand that describes the magnitude of climate change effects there. In
fact, much of the information currently available regarding climate
change in Alaska is focused on the more Northern and interior parts of
Alaska, which are seeing dangerous rates of permafrost melt, rising sea
level, and erosion. An initial [climate action]{.mark} step taken by
Tlingit & Haida in 2015 [was to push for more studies]{.mark} of climate
change impacts in Southeast and as a result, the Tribe
[developed]{.mark} a Climate Change Adaptation [Plan outlining key
impacts]{.mark} and Resilience Strategies for addressing the issues. The
plan identifies changing conditions of temperature, precipitation, ocean
acidification, forest habitat, invasive species and human health as well
as key areas of concern such as salmon, shellfish, cedar, forage fish,
berries, and seal. The Tribe's plan [includes]{.mark} a [ranking
system]{.mark} to help prioritize areas of concern and is intended to
serve as a prototype for all Southeast Alaska tribes and
villages.]{.underline}**

The Yukon Territory is one of three northern territories in Canada and
is comprised of 14 self-governing First Nations including:
Carcross/Tagish First Nation, Champagne and Aishihik First Nations,
Ehdiitat Gwich'in Council, First Nation of Nacho Nyak Dun, Gwichya
Gwich'in Council, Kluane First Nation, Little Salmon Carmacks First
Nation, Nihtat Gwich'in Council, Selkirk First Nation, Ta'an Kwach'an
Council, Teslin Tlingit Council, Tetlit Gwich'in Council, and Tr'ondek
Hwech'in. As these tribes are historically nomadic, **[transboundary
First Nations are considered part of the Yukon's [Indigenous
groups]{.mark} while the Council for Yukon First Nations is
[representative]{.mark} only [of]{.mark} the [14 nations]{.mark} with
land claims who are listed above. This territory is mountainous with
high plateaus, rivers, tundra in the north, forests in the south, and
extends from the brim of British Columbia into the Arctic Circle
reaching the Beaufort Sea. The region experiences primarily an Arctic
climate and so is majorly impacted by permafrost melt]{.underline}**.
Permafrost thaw, being the most severe impact, causes sediment float
released from the melt to contaminate water quality and release more
greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Increasing average temperature
also leads to melting glaciers and sea ice, more extreme weather and
storms, unpredictable rain and snow patterns, and an increase in
invasive species. These impacts seriously affect the livelihoods, food
security, economic opportunity, and safety of Yukoners.

**[Historical cultural roots between Southeast Alaska and the Yukon
strengthen the regions' ability to work together when upholding
self-determination and carrying out climate action efforts. Today,
issues affecting British Columbia, Southeast Alaska, and the Yukon such
as transboundary [mining have brought]{.mark} ongoing
[collabo]{.mark}ration of the Indigenous governments intended [to
protect]{.mark} and preserve the natural [resources]{.mark} of their
homelands. In 2016, Tlingit & Haida President Richard Peterson drafted a
treaty proposal for the [Indigenous nations]{.mark}, the Treaty of
Mutual Cooperation with First Nations, to formally establish their
intent to [work together to address]{.mark} concerns related to
transboundary [mining]{.mark} activities]{.underline}**. Further,
congregations of tribal leadership across Canada and the United States
have formally declared unity, which strengthens the responsibility of
tribes to support one another when called upon.

The "Declaration of Kinship and Cooperation among Indigenous Peoples and
Nations of North America," signed by National Chief of the Assembly of

its activities in the region**[. The [US]{.mark} now [perceives
Russia]{.mark}'s Arctic activities [as a]{.mark} direct
[challenge]{.mark}, [forcing]{.mark} increased military
[engagement]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In response to Russian expansion,
the US introduced new military strategies, including the 2007
Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower and the 2021 \"Blue
Arctic\" strategy. These initiatives aim to maintain naval dominance,
promoting international control of Arctic waters against Russian and
Chinese interests.

**[The US [highlighted]{.mark} its military [presence]{.mark} in the
Arctic, conducting [joint]{.mark} NATO [exercises]{.mark} with the UK,
Norway, and Canada. The revival of the US Second Fleet and the
establishment of new military bases and surveillance radars in Alaska
and Greenland signal a stronger commitment to Arctic security.
[Russia]{.mark}, in turn, has heavily [strengthened its]{.mark} Arctic
military [capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It established the
Northern Fleet as a Joint Strategic Command, deployed advanced air
defense systems, and expanded its naval and aviation infrastructure. The
Arctic has become a focal point of Russia's security and economic
policy, particularly with its control over the Northern Sea Route, a
crucial trade passage.

As both nations increase their military activities, **[the Arctic
[transforms into]{.mark} a zone of geopolitical [tension]{.mark}. The
[US]{.mark} [seeks to challenge]{.mark} [Russia]{.mark}'s strength and
cut down China's Arctic ambitions, [while Russia remains determined
to]{.mark} validate [its claims]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The region's
militarization raises concerns about potential conflicts. However,
diplomatic efforts continue, aiming to balance competition with
cooperation through Arctic security dialogues to prevent conflicts and
maintain regional stability.

ability to extract resources**

future lies in Arctic, minister tells RT," Russia Today,

6/29/25

**[The [Arctic]{.mark} is [crucial for]{.mark} the future of Russia's
[economy]{.mark}, Aleksey Chekunkov, minister for the development of the
Far East and the Arctic, told RT during the St. Petersburg International
Economic Forum on Wednesday. He believes that [infrastructure]{.mark}
projects such as the Eastern Range, Northern Sea Route, [and]{.mark}
various [ventures to extract]{.mark} and process the region's natural
[resources]{.mark}, [will benefit Russia for decades]{.mark} to
come.]{.underline}**

**[Chekunkov noted that the [region is rich in]{.mark} unique precious
[metals]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} is the source of nearly [90% of]{.mark}
Russia's natural [gas]{.mark}. It will soon be home to floating natural
gas liquefaction plants that will [be able to produce 7 million tons of
LNG]{.mark} per year. The region is [also rich in oil]{.mark}, with the
largest project, Rosneft's Vostok Oil, [expected to produce]{.mark} up
to [100 million tons]{.mark} of crude annually by 2031-2032.
[Russia's]{.mark} first floating [nuclear power]{.mark} station is [also
located in]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**["The Arctic and the Far East are a treasure trove. The [Arctic is
where the]{.mark} future [econ]{.mark}omy of Russia [is being
built]{.mark}. What happens today in the Arctic and the Far East will
serve many generations of Russians]{.underline}**," Chekunkov said.

**[He [noted](https://rumble.com/v2ub6a6-spief23-russias-northern-sea-route-is-alternative-to-volatile-options-that-.html) that
the country is currently focused on further developing infrastructure in
the region, particularly the Northern Sea Route.]{.underline}**

"It is the most dynamically developing sea transport corridor in the
world today. Over the last seven years its freight turnover has grown
more than eight times from 4 million tons to 34 million. By 2031 we can
expect Russian cargo turnover alone to reach 200 million tons per year,"
Chekunkov stated, noting that these volumes are comparable to what goes
through the Suez Canal today. Apart from the route's importance as a
shorter link between Asia and Europe and its economic benefits, it also
provides a safe alternative to other maritime freight passageways due to
being distant from conflict zones, the minister noted.

Chekunkov noted that many of Russia's foreign partners are expressing
interest in joining the country in developing the Northern Sea Route,
but warned that such partnerships need to be struck today, as in ten
years it may be too late.

"Those who are compelled to delay their cooperation with Russia for
political reasons will regret it tomorrow. China, India and the Middle
East, the UAE and Saudi Arabia are actively cooperating with us. These
countries will be the beneficiaries of the Northern Sea Route
development in the next ten years. Over the next ten years it will
become a global transportation corridor where only those who can partner
with us today will be able to go," he stated.

**[The minister said that the Western sanctions imposed on Russia over
the Ukraine conflict have had a positive impact on development of the
Arctic. He likened the sanctions to a "disease in the human body, which
provokes an immune reaction, and stressed that "the Russian economy is
going through this immune reaction with dignity."]{.underline}**

**["We haven't even stumbled. The [pace of]{.mark} new [investments has
increased]{.mark}. While we had [248]{.mark} investment
[projects]{.mark} in 2021, the number [reached 260]{.mark} in 2022,
while [over 50]{.mark} new [businesses were launched]{.mark}. Some
projects required changes... but companies were able to adjust. All in
all, it made us stronger, it made us more self-sufficient, it gave the
industry the push to build what we've been buying for ten
years,]{.underline}**" he stated.

Having a meltdown

**[The [Kremlin's]{.mark} growing [insecurities about Russia's]{.mark}
military and resource capabilities have [deepened]{.mark} [significantly
since]{.mark} the invasion of [Ukraine]{.mark}. The accession of Finland
and Sweden to [NATO]{.mark} has [left Russia]{.mark} effectively
"[encircled]{.mark}" by the alliance's members in the Arctic. [This
intensified]{.mark} its [feelings of
vulnerability]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as did the 2022 sabotage of the
Nord Stream pipelines. Although Russia had already halted gas deliveries
through the pipelines, the attack exposed its inability to secure
critical infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. In 2024, a successful
Ukrainian drone strike on the Olenya airbase---located above the Arctic
Circle and home to Russia's strategic bomber aircraft---dealt another
blow to Kremlin confidence.

In parallel, [**Western sanctions targeting Russia's Arctic projects
have intensified**]{.underline} since 2022, with the 17th EU package
adopted in May 2025. They have largely focused on a deep insecurity for
Russia: liquefied natural gas (LNG). But the Kremlin has little room for
manoeuvre against these measures. It has promoted projects like Arctic
LNG 2 as replacements for lost pipeline gas exports to Europe. But
Western countries have imposed successive sanctions aimed at undermining
the project's viability including blacklisting the operating company,
restricting access to LNG ice-class tankers and targeting tanker
operators. As a result, despite reported efforts by Russia to circumvent
some of these restrictions on Western equipment, the timeline for Arctic
LNG 2 has repeatedly been delayed.

These events have hastened the security dilemma in the Arctic.
**[[Russian officials]{.mark} now [interpret]{.mark} nearly [all

"potential [prelude to direct confrontation]{.mark}" while they widely

As the world fixates on the battlefields of Ukraine and the volatile
Middle East, a quieter but no less consequential struggle is unfolding
in the Arctic. **[[Washington's]{.mark} latest
[maneuver]{.mark}---planning [to acquire]{.mark} [icebreakers]{.mark}
from Finland [amid]{.mark} what some call [an "Arctic
crisis]{.mark}"---[signals a bold]{.mark} [escalation]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} the polar region in the context of [competition]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} Beijing and [Moscow]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[This move, paired with the Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen's
recent trip to Greenland, and President Donald Trump's proposed energy
sanctions targeting Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) expansion (if he
doesn't change his mind), reveals a troubling pattern: once again, this
has everything to do with the US-led [NATO's]{.mark} relentless [push to
encircle Russia]{.mark}, even at the risk of [igniting a new]{.mark}
[geopolitical flashpoint]{.mark} (even if Trump seems to be "turning his
back" to the Alliance).]{.underline}**

[**[The Arctic]{.mark}, far from being a frozen backwater, is poised to
become the [next]{.mark} major [arena of U.S.-Russian
contention]{.mark}---a development that exposes Trump's America imperial
ambitions and undermines claims of "isolationism" or of fostering peace
and stability for that matter**.]{.underline} Ironically, we now have an
American president openly threatening (with annexation) the sovereignty
of NATO European "ally", Denmark, over the issue of Greenland.

The icebreaker deal with Finland is no mere logistical upgrade. Trump
has framed it as a critical step "amid Arctic security concerns," with
Washington aiming to bolster its polar presence against Russia's
formidable fleet of over 36 icebreakers. One should pay attention also
to the trilateral ICE Pact with Canada and Finland; expert Daniel
McVicar (Research Director at White House Writers Group), predicts Trump
will expand it to counter "Russian influence."

Meanwhile, the Danish Prime Minister's visit to Greenland, underscores
Washington's broader strategy to secure strategic footholds in the
region. Greenland, a Danish territory, has long been a target of Trump's
fixation---he recently reiterated his desire to "get Greenland," ---a
notion Russian President Vladimir Putin has called a "serious" U.S.
intent. These moves are not about defense; they are about dominance.

Trump's proposed energy sanctions, exceeding the scope of the 2019
measures, aim to choke Russia's LNG ambitions, which are deeply tied to
the Arctic. Russia's Northern Sea Route, a thawing shipping lane along
its Arctic coast, promises to redirect energy exports to Asia,
circumventing Western chokeholds like the Suez Canal. By targeting this
lifeline, the U.S. seeks to kneecap Moscow's economic resilience---a
tactic less about security and more about maintaining American hegemony.
**[The region's vast untapped resources]{.underline}**, from oil and gas
to rare earth minerals, **[only heighten the stakes]{.underline}**. One
may recall that the U.S. (then still under President Joe Biden, mind
you) has already claimed a "huge portion of the ocean floor" from the
Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic, a unilateral grab that flouts
international norms and highlights the American expansionist ethos.

Increasingly warm temperatures in the Arctic region, which facilitate
navigation, present a significant opportunity for the liquefied natural
gas industry, among other benefits, hence the strategic importance of
that area. Additionally (and relatedly), still during Biden's
administration, tensions have escalated in the Gulf of Finland. It's
worth noting that NATO's further expansion under Biden, incorporating
Sweden and Finland, has extended the Alliance's territory all the way to
Russia's eastern Arctic flank (the Bering Strait), thus leaving Russia
as the sole non-NATO country in the Arctic. This is the context for
Trump's Greenland and Arctic "obsession".

**[NATO's cheerleaders might argue that all of this is a necessary
response to Russian "aggression." After all, they claim, Moscow has
militarized its Arctic frontier, with nuclear-powered icebreakers and
new combat vessels like the Ivan Papanin. But this narrative
conveniently ignores [NATO's]{.mark} own [history of
provocations]{.mark}. The alliance's eastward creep---absorbing Finland
and Sweden---has turned the Gulf of Finland into a potential "site of
new conflict," as I've written before.]{.underline}**

Finland's integration into the ICE Pact and its icebreaker expertise,
means that the Nordic country, once a neutral asset, now serves NATO's
agenda---even when the incumbent American President is accused of
"abandoning" the transatlantic alliance. **[This shift [has strained
Arctic cooperation]{.mark}, with Russia excluded from regional forums
like the Arctic Council since 2022. [Far from stabilizing the region,
the United States actions are fracturing it.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The Greenland obsession epitomizes this overreach. Trump's fixation,
dismissed as eccentric in 2019, now aligns with a calculated NATO
strategy, even while Trumps go as far as to threaten a member ally such
as the Kingdom of Denmark. One may very well describe it as "part of a
scramble for the Arctic," (as Al-Jazeera called it) given Greenland's
strategic position astride key shipping routes and its mineral wealth.

Denmark is ramping up its Arctic defenses, yet its sovereignty over
Greenland is increasingly a bargaining chip in Washington's game.
Putin's remarks at an Arctic conference underscore Moscow's alarm: the
U.S. isn't just eyeing territory---it's projecting power into Russia's
backyard. This isn't deterrence; it's encirclement.

One must ask: who benefits from this Arctic gambit? Certainly not the
global commons. The ICE Pact and sanctions risk escalating tensions in a
region where cooperation---on climate, shipping, and resource
management---once held promise. **[Even from an American perspective,
Russia's exclusion from Arctic dialogue pushes Moscow toward China (the
exact opposite of what Trump supposedly is trying to achieve by means of
a so-called "reverse Kissinger" strategy), in a context of a New Cold
War, thereby forming a counter bloc that could destabilize the polar
balance further. China's "Polar Silk Road" ambitions, paired with
Russia's icebreaking prowess, challenge NATO's aggressive dominance, yet
the alliance's response---more militarization, more sanctions---only
deepens the divide.]{.underline}**

**[The Arctic should not be NATO's next frontier. Its transformation
into a geopolitical chessboard reflects the alliance's Cold War
reflexes, ill-suited to an emerging multipolar world. [Trump's
icebreaker push]{.mark} and energy sanctions [may]{.mark} bolster U.S.
leverage, but they also [invite retaliation]{.mark}---perhaps in the
Gulf of Finland, or through Russia's LNG pivot to Asia. To recap, the
U.S. claims vast swathes of seabed, NATO tightens its grip on Greenland,
and Finland's shipyards churn out tools of confrontation. [This isn't
security---it's a recipe for conflict.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[[A saner approach]{.mark} [would]{.mark} [prioritize
de-escalation]{.mark}: [reintegrating Russia into Arctic]{.mark}
[forums]{.mark}, negotiating resource-sharing pacts, and curbing NATO's
northward sprawl. [The Arctic's future hinges]{.mark} [on
cooperation]{.mark}, [not conquest]{.mark}. [Yet as Washington]{.mark}
[doubles down]{.mark}, dragging its allies along, [the ice grows
thinner]{.mark}---both literally and figuratively. In fact, [the next
U.S.-Russian clash may erupt]{.mark} not [in]{.mark} Ukraine or Syria,
but rather in [the frozen north]{.mark}, [where NATO's hubris could
spark a fire no icebreaker can extinguish.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

conditions and rising sea waters. Draft Arctic policy circulated in
January 2021 for public response that included five pillars: science and
research activities, economic and human development cooperation,
transportation and connectivity, governance and international
cooperation, and national capacity building. While New Delhi is still to
notify its official Arctic policy, the January 2021 draft version as
noted earlier seeks to play a constructive role through scientific
research, climate studies and sustainable harnessing of resources.\[96\]
It also expresses an interest to invest in regional infrastructure and
digital economy, while also contributing to the efforts of the Arctic
Council. India is interested in connectivity routes opening up,
investment in Russian oil and gas sector, mineral resources, scientific
research. It is concerned about the impact of melting polar ice caps on
monsoon patterns in South Asia, besides other extreme weather phenomena.
However, despite coming at a time of evolving regional order in the
Arctic, the draft policy did not focus on geopolitical developments in
the Arctic. In terms of bilateral interactions with Russia, a peaceful
region would facilitate India's forays into different energy and
infrastructure projects, further facilitating its engagement with both
the Russian Far East and the Arctic as part of the India-Russia
bilateral partnership. If India plans to increase resource imports via
the Chennai-Vladivostok maritime corridor, then security in the Arctic
would be an important consideration. New Delhi also has cordial
relations with other Arctic states, and must build on these partnerships
to preserve its positive engagement with the region. A key step in that
direction would be unveiling its Arctic policy that sets the agenda,
aims, and boundaries of Indian presence in the high north for the short
to medium term.

Conclusion

**[[Russia's manoeuvres in the Arctic region]{.underline}]{.mark}**
emerge from a finely balanced policy that has elements of both
cooperation and competition. **[[It has a large economic stake in the
region and seeks to maximise gains from resource
extraction]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The Arctic is crucial for its
national security and its projection as a great power. Moscow needs
foreign investment to realise its ambitions.

Meanwhile, the Arctic States have not demonstrated willingness to engage
in direct conflict in the region, and want to maintain their primacy.
This common interest has meant that despite the rising tensions between
Russia and the West, its negative impact on the Arctic has been largely
absent.\[97\] The work of the Arctic Council continues with a focus on
cooperation on issues related to sustainable development, climate
change, conservation, emergency response, and marine environment
protection.

All stakeholders are adopting a responsible approach towards problem
solving in the Arctic. At the same time, **[[increasing militarisation
and opening up of new maritime routes]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as well as
rising interest from China, has the potential to heighten uncertainty in
the region. The debate around Russia's new rules regarding navigation in
the Northern Sea Route, as well as its legal status, can also be a
source of friction in the future. Greater clarity will be needed when
international transits increase on the route in the future.\[98\]

While there are reservations in the West regarding re-starting the
security dialogue mechanism on Arctic with Russia, lest it be construed
as a weakening of its post-Ukraine position, the prevailing situation
demands that alternative modes of communication be established not only
to further regional stability, but also to deal with the potential
fallout of a rising power like China seeking to enhance its influence in
the high north.

Russia as a leading Arctic power will have to be transparent about its
intentions and future plans. This will be a crucial signal for all
stakeholders with the potential impact extending across regional
military and non-military dynamics.\[99\] This will also help maintain
regional peace and attract the foreign investment needed to fulfil
development plans around the Arctic.

The absence of active disputes, adherence to established collaborative
practices in the Arctic Council, and a desire to maintain stability
among key actors has meant that the probability of conflict remains low
at present. However, this does not mean that the states can afford to
take the idea of 'Arctic exceptionalism' for granted. **[If the rising
concerns over increased [militarisation]{.mark} are not addressed, it
[could have unintended consequences for the region and lead to the
deterioration of relations]{.mark}]{.underline}** among the key
stakeholders.

Abstract: Russia is the only non-NATO country among all Arctic
neighbouring nations. It is uniquely placed, both in terms of the
capacities it possesses and the challenges it faces while operating in
the Arctic. The US, unlike Russia in the Arctic region, enjoys the
support of the majority of the Arctic states. However, possessing the
largest territorial area, **[[Russia owns a huge territory in the
Arctic. The]{.underline}]{.mark}** Northern Sea Route
(**[[NSR]{.underline}]{.mark}**) runs along the Russian Arctic coast.
The US claims the NSR is an international waterway, whereas Russia
claims the waters are historically its own. **[[The Arctic represents an
important chapter of the US-Russia relationship from the beginning to
current times]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Problem statement: How to understand Russia's former and potential
future role in the Arctic?

Bottom-line-up-front: Despite the Russian invasion of Ukraine causing
several deadlocks and placing countries at diplomatic loggerheads,
dissolving the Arctic Council seems unthinkable. However, having no
neutral members may undermine the council's credibility, yet the Arctic
Council has been successful in resolving any dispute previously. The US
is aware that any organisation in the Arctic region with NATO members
may encourage other sub-Arctic states to interfere in Arctic politics
and cause more dangers in the future.

So what?: According to Russia, one reason for the crisis was the
reaction to expanding the membership of NATO. Moreover, Russia may have
also not understood that the world is now multipolar. Russia must avoid
retaining the Cold War's bitterness and continue scientific research. It
must remember that the mandate of the Arctic Council in which security
issues were eliminated by noting that their inclusion could sour the
relationship between NATO and Russia. The Arctic Council mandate was
itself an assurance of maintaining collaboration on the Arctic
Environmental issue under all the conditions.

The Arctic: A Geopolitical Hotspot

The Arctic is the world's smallest and shallowest ocean but is
surrounded by some of the largest, most dominant global players. Of the
Arctic nations, Russia, Canada, and the US are unique by virtue of
having continental shelves in three oceans: the Pacific, the Arctic, and
the Atlantic. Initiating any cooperative treaty amongst the Arctic
states during the Cold War seemed almost impossible. Especially because
it was already an arena ripe with discontent ever since the Alaska
Purchase of 1867, this agreement which ceded Alaska to the US, has
remained a cause for disagreement between the US and Russia: it led to
friction regarding the division of maritime boundaries in the Bering
Sea.\[1\]

Of the Arctic nations, Russia, Canada, and the US are unique by virtue
of having continental shelves in three oceans: the Pacific, the Arctic,

**[[The question of sovereignty over the NSR or]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Northeast Passage (**[[NEP) is another reason for friction between the
US and Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The US and its European allies
claim the NSR as an international strait.\[2\] However, Russia differs,
claiming historical and comprehensive Russian authority over these
waters. The US also opposes its closest ally, Canada, to counter the
Russian position, arguing that the waters in the Northwest Passage (NWP)
are historically theirs.\[3\] The US maintains that the waters in the
NWP running through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) are
international. Russia and Canada own territories in the Arctic through
which the potential sea lanes may pass. Here too, the challenges are
similar, with the **[[main being the issue of sovereignty over the
passages]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This has promoted Russia and Canada to
maintain corresponding positions against the US. Canada is also looking
for solace in Russia on matters of sovereignty. In such a situation,
Russia finds it prudent to support Canada against the US. Another
irritant between the US and Russia is the US's refusal to endorse the
United Nations Convention on the Law of Seas III, 1982(UNCLOS III).\[4\]

direction would be unveiling its Arctic policy that sets the agenda,
aims, and boundaries of Indian presence in the high north for the short
to medium term.

Conclusion

**[[Russia's manoeuvres in the Arctic region]{.underline}]{.mark}**
emerge from a finely balanced policy that has elements of both
cooperation and competition. **[[It has a large economic stake in the
region and seeks to maximise gains from resource
extraction]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The Arctic is crucial for its
national security and its projection as a great power. Moscow needs
foreign investment to realise its ambitions.

Meanwhile, the Arctic States have not demonstrated willingness to engage
in direct conflict in the region, and want to maintain their primacy.
This common interest has meant that despite the rising tensions between
Russia and the West, its negative impact on the Arctic has been largely
absent.\[97\] The work of the Arctic Council continues with a focus on
cooperation on issues related to sustainable development, climate
change, conservation, emergency response, and marine environment
protection.

All stakeholders are adopting a responsible approach towards problem
solving in the Arctic. At the same time, **[[increasing militarisation
and opening up of new maritime routes]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as well as
rising interest from China, has the potential to heighten uncertainty in
the region. The debate around Russia's new rules regarding navigation in
the Northern Sea Route, as well as its legal status, can also be a
source of friction in the future. Greater clarity will be needed when
international transits increase on the route in the future.\[98\]

While there are reservations in the West regarding re-starting the
security dialogue mechanism on Arctic with Russia, lest it be construed
as a weakening of its post-Ukraine position, the prevailing situation
demands that alternative modes of communication be established not only
to further regional stability, but also to deal with the potential
fallout of a rising power like China seeking to enhance its influence in
the high north.

Russia as a leading Arctic power will have to be transparent about its
intentions and future plans. This will be a crucial signal for all
stakeholders with the potential impact extending across regional
military and non-military dynamics.\[99\] This will also help maintain
regional peace and attract the foreign investment needed to fulfil
development plans around the Arctic.

The absence of active disputes, adherence to established collaborative
practices in the Arctic Council, and a desire to maintain stability
among key actors has meant that the probability of conflict remains low
at present. However, this does not mean that the states can afford to
take the idea of 'Arctic exceptionalism' for granted. **[If the rising
concerns over increased [militarisation]{.mark} are not addressed, it
[could have unintended consequences for the region and lead to the
deterioration of relations]{.mark}]{.underline}** among the key
stakeholders.

Protecting Russia's Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity [Russia has a
national interest in the Arctic for "ensuring sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the Russian Federation]{.underline} \[emphasis
added\]."5 This is a new Arctic national interest, one that clearly
raises the Arctic's profile as a Russian national priority. This is not
surprising because the Kremlin has often emphasized the Arctic's
increasing importance to the state. Nevertheless, [**[Arctic
Policy]{.mark} 2035 clearly [ties Russian sovereignty and territorial
integrity to the Arctic]{.mark}. Responsibility for ensuring Russia's
national sovereignty and territorial integrity falls upon the Russian
military. The main military security goals of the new Arctic policy are
"prevention of the use of military force against Russia, protection of
its sovereignty and territorial integrity,"6 along with increasing
Russia's combat fighting capabilities in the Arctic.7 This reinforces a
continuation of Russia's Arctic policy development that Moscow has
expressed over several years and in numerous actions, such as the
ongoing military modernization program along Russia's Arctic coastline.
Arctic Policy 2035 explicitly introduces the concepts of sovereignty and
territorial integrity, which align with [Russia]{.mark}'s [claim]{.mark}
that it exercises sovereign [control over the NSR]{.mark}, a claim the
United States and many other states dispute. Russia has increasingly
tightened control over foreign vessel traffic transiting the NSR. Last
year Moscow implemented regulations imposing "new limitations for
foreign warships transiting the \[NSR\],"8 months after a French Navy
supply ship transited the sea route without Russian permission.9 The
United States opposes such restrictions as contrary to international law
and importantly, "the U.S. Navy regularly contests them as part of its
broader Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs) program."10 [The
Arctic's]{.mark} security [environment is becoming increasingly]{.mark}
complex, uncertain, and [concerning to the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates. One dynamic contributing to uncertainty in the region
is the status of the NSR**.]{.underline} The United States considers
Russia's self-proclaimed right to regulate vessels entering and
transiting the NSR excessive. 11 Washington is also concerned that
Moscow has "repeatedly threatened to use force against vessels that fail
to abide by Russian regulations"12 in the NSR. [Russia's claimed
sovereignty over the NSR threatens U.S. national 3 security by turning
the Arctic region into "a \[image omitted\] potential corridor for
strategic competition.]{.underline}"13 The best way to prevent this is
for the United States to guarantee freedom of navigation through the
NSR. This is precisely what Washington says it will do. The 2019 DoD
Arctic strategy states the United States, "\[w\]hen necessary and
appropriate...will challenge excessive maritime claims in the Arctic."
14 The time will come when it is necessary and appropriate to ensure the
NSR remains an international waterway and not Russia's internal waters.
The ability to conduct FONOPs is an essential element of preserving
freedom of the seas, which is a longstanding U.S. national security
interest. **[[U.S. interest in ensuring freedom of the seas conflicts
with Russia]{.mark}'s stated right to control access to the NSR
[and]{.mark} could [serve as a flashpoint for great power
tension]{.mark} between Moscow and Washington. The Russian Arctic as a
Strategic Resource Base for National Economic Growth Arctic Policy 2035
identifies a second Russian Arctic national interest with implications
for the NSR: "development of the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation
as a strategic resource base and its rational use with the objective of
accelerating economic growth of the Russian Federation \[emphasis
added\]."15 Russia's ability to promote, foster, and exploit strategic
natural resource development in the Arctic is critical to the country's
national security and economic well-being. Russia's Arctic zone already
produces 10 percent of the country's gross domestic product and 20
percent of its exports. 16 Led by Arctic Policy 2035, Moscow has clearly
"enhanced the role of its Arctic areas within both its domestic and
foreign policy."17 For example, this past February and just prior to
releasing its new Arctic policy, the Russian government renamed its
Ministry for the Development of the Russia Far East to the Ministry for
the Development of the Russian Far East and the Arctic. 18
[Russia's]{.mark} ambitious [plans]{.mark} to transform the Arctic into
a strategic resource base and economic engine [are tempered]{.mark} by
the speed and duration of ice melt in the Arctic Ocean and particularly
along the NSR. The faster the ice melts throughout the Arctic,
presumably [the easier it becomes to]{.mark} locate and [extract]{.mark}
the region's natural [resources and reap]{.mark} the economic
[benefits]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The rapidly warming Arctic also has
significant negative consequences, as recent events indicate. In June
2020, a fuel reservoir in Russia's Siberia region collapsed, causing one
of the worst oil spills ever within the Arctic Circle. Preliminary
reports suggest melting permafrost was the primary cause of the
disaster.19 This occurred the same month the Russian Siberian town of
Verkhoyansk recorded a temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit, an
all-time high temperature in the Arctic Circle. 20 Rapid warming in the
polar north could undermine 4 Moscow's ability to fully develop the
infrastructure to enhance the Russian Arctic zone's strategic resource
base, as well as protect the region's environment and traditional ways
of life. The NSR as a Globally Competitive National Transport Corridor
Arctic Policy 2035 lays out a third Russian Arctic national interest
important to the NSR: "development of the Northern Sea Route as a
competitive national transport line of the Russian Federation in the
global market \[emphasis added\]."21 The NSR is the most important
entity in the Arctic to Russia. Internally, the NSR serves as the
connective tissue between Russia's beleaguered and often neglected
Arctic landmass and the economic potential that infrastructure
development might bring to this vast northern coast. Although only two
million Russians live in the Arctic region, the region makes up
approximately one-third of Russia's landmass. 22 Externally, the NSR
links Russia's economic viability in the Arctic to the rest of the
world. Moscow is counting on the NSR to become a competitive
international shipping route between East Asia and Europe, drastically
reducing transit times.23 For example, a cargo vessel going from London
to Yokohama, Japan, on a southerly route via the Suez Canal travels
approximately 11,400 nautical miles; the distance between the same two
cities along the NSR would be approximately 7,200 nautical miles---37
percent shorter.24 Russia seeks to benefit economically through a
well-developed support infrastructure network strung along its Arctic
coastline. **[[Developing the NSR is]{.mark} so [critical to
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}** that the Arctic policy principles identify
"failure to meet deadlines for the establishment of infrastructure of
the Northern Sea Route"25 as one of seven threats to Russian national
security in the Arctic. (See Appendix.) However, the NSR is currently
nowhere close to becoming a significant maritime corridor. It handles
three categories of shipping traffic: "domestic traffic, resource export
traffic, and transit traffic."26 Most of the NSR's traffic is domestic
and resource export traffic that primarily serves Russia's domestic
needs. However, transit traffic is the most important traffic type for
developing the NSR into a viable global shipping route.27 Until Russia
significantly increases NSR transit traffic, Moscow will not be able to
successfully "attest to \[the route's\] utility and value"28 to the
international community. Russian President Putin acknowledges this
problem and issued a directive in 2018 to increase Arctic shipping to 80
million tons per year by 2024.29 Russia's NSR infrastructure development
plan also seeks to address this concern. However, even the figure Putin
decrees is still far below what shipping industry analysts say is needed
to make Arctic shipping competitive. **[[Implications for the
NSR]{.mark} and Great Power Competition Moscow [considers]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and its NATO allies [a threat to]{.mark}
Russia's Arctic plans and [interests]{.mark}, including in the
NSR.]{.underline}** Likewise, the **[West is increasingly concerned
about Russia's intentions in the Arctic region, particularly in the
context of rapid climate change]{.underline}** that is altering the way
militaries operate in the region. As a result, the United States and
other NATO states have become more active in the Arctic region. 5 In
March 2020, Norway, a NATO member state that shares a land border with
Russia, conducted its COLD RESPONSE multinational exercise near Russia's
northern borders. Norway has held this biennial exercise since 2006 "to
secure the Norwegian Armed Forces and allies\' ability to conduct
multinational joint exercises with a high-intensity combat scenario in
demanding winter conditions." 30 This year's exercise was eventually
curtailed due to the COVID-19 global pandemic but was conducted "in
cooperation with NATO members and partners, (including the United
States)."31 There were no indications Russia directly responded to this
year's COLD RESPONSE. Although Moscow has criticized the West for
conducting military operations near Russia's northern borders, the
Russian military did conduct "a live-fire exercise"32 near the
Norwegian-Russian border weeks before Norway initiated COLD RESPONSE. In
May 2020, the United States and United Kingdom conducted a joint naval
exercise in the Barents Sea near Russian waters.33 This was no mere
joint military exercise. It marked "the first U.S. exercise in the
Barents Sea since the mid-1990s"34 and was designed "to assert freedom
of navigation and demonstrate seamless integration among allies."35
Washington and London gave Moscow prior notice of the FONOP to prevent
any surprises, and Moscow responded by initiating its own naval exercise
in the Barents Sea at the conclusion of the U.S.- UK exercise.36 The
joint FONOP signifies a "massive statement of intent"37 by Washington
and London that the **[West]{.underline} [is]{.underline} [committed to
policing the Arctic region's international waters]{.underline}.** The
U.S.-UK joint exercise raises "a looming question \[of\] where future
Arctic FONOPS might take place, given the stated **[disagreements
between the US and Russia over navigation rights in the
NSR]{.underline}**."38 One obvious location for future FONOPs in the
Arctic is within the NSR. The 2018 French naval supply ship transiting
through the NSR establishes a foundation for future Arctic FONOPs. The
question now becomes one of timing and risks. First, when would the
United States or other NATO member states conduct FONOPs along the NSR?
The level of sea ice along the route would be one factor in the timing.
Furthermore, what risks would both the United States and other NATO
member states and Russia be willing to accept over such operations?
**[[Russia's]{.mark} increased [securitization of the Arctic]{.mark},
coupled [with]{.mark} the [increasing U.S.]{.mark} power [projection in
the region, could lead to conflicting]{.mark} national security
[interests and clashes]{.mark} in the near future.]{.underline}** The
Kremlin indicates that it believes the Arctic can remain a region of
cooperation rather than competition; however, **[Moscow will not
hesitate to protect its Arctic national interests]{.underline}**. For
example, in June 2020, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov
warned Russia "will not in any way stay quiet ... if someone ... would
try to test our readiness to defend our interests of national security
in \[the Arctic\]."39

**[But [over the past six years]{.mark}, [at least a dozen
scientists]{.mark}, many of whom conducted research in the field of
high-speed aerodynamics or hypersonics, [have been arrested]{.mark}.
Some of the arrests were on suspicion of handing over scientific data to
Moscow's rivals. The latest was sentenced to 15 years in
prison.]{.underline}**

**[[Several]{.mark} had been [detained after]{.mark} participating in
[research]{.mark} [with other countries]{.mark}, [with the

Putin's pet project

Hypersonic missiles are one of President Vladimir Putin's pet projects
and are one of the few areas in which Russia can claim to lead the
world.

Because of their speed---they can travel at more than five times the
speed of sound---they can be launched from great distances and evade
most air defenses. They can carry conventional or nuclear warheads and
are maneuverable and can strike targets quickly, before the enemy can
prepare or even know they are coming.

The U.S. hasn't deployed any similar weapons. Both Russia and China
have, and while European nations are developing hypersonic and
supersonic weapons, they are a long way from catching up with Moscow and
Beijing, experts say.

ous to keep Russia ahead of the pack, especially now that tensions with
the West have reached a nadir and the war in Ukraine could last for
several more years.

The Kremlin has acknowledged using the superfast weapons against
Ukraine. That includes the 3M22 Zircon hypersonic missile, which Moscow
says can travel up to nine times the speed of sound with at least a
660-pound warhead, making Russia's bombardment of its smaller neighbor
more lethal than ever. Ukraine claims to have had success shooting down
earlier hypersonic weapons, such as the Kinzhal air-launched ballistic
missile. But Russia dismisses that claim and appears set to continue
work on developing ever-faster weapons.

The notion that any kind of information relating to these missiles could
make its way into the open worries Putin, analysts say, and the
immediate target of the arrests appears to be the scientists who helped
design them.

**[At least six researchers have been detained since Russia invaded
Ukraine in February 2022, including three working in aerodynamic science
at the Khristianovich Institute of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics in
Siberia. That added to concern across the scientific community that, in
Putin's Russia, what you know can be as dangerous as what you do with
it.]{.underline}**

"It gradually built up over many years, but naturally gained a
particularly wide reach after the start of the full-scale war," Davidis
said.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists earlier this year that
he couldn't comment on the arrests because of the involvement of
Russia's security services and their serious nature.

Rebooting Stalin's reign of terror

Russia has seen something similar before. **[During the Soviet era,
several scientists were falsely persecuted]{.underline}** in the 1930s
during Joseph Stalin's reign of terror, including Sergei Korolev, who
went on to become one of the early leaders of the Soviet Union's space
program, and his colleague, rocket engineer Valentin Glushko. Alexei
Tupolev, internationally recognized as among the world's leading
aircraft designers, was also arrested on charges of activities against
the state.

This more recent wave of arrests began after Putin gave an address to
the country's Federal Assembly in 2018, where he first unveiled
hypersonic nuclear weapons he said were capable of penetrating U.S.
missile defenses, using digital animations to reinforce his point.

Some analysts suggested there was an element of theater behind the
detentions in that they help buttress the idea that Russia had achieved
a significant technological advantage.

But the range of those detained speaks to the growing paranoia in the
Kremlin over how to safeguard these advances.

**[[Most]{.mark} of the [scientists]{.mark} arrested [are older
academics]{.mark} [who]{.mark} have had distinguished careers. They have
worked for prestigious Russian institutions, been co-authors of papers
on aerodynamics with foreign colleagues and attended overseas
conferences---and [didn't]{.mark} necessarily [have a direct
role]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the developing the weapons applications
of the new technology.

Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2018 unveiled hypersonic nuclear
weapons he said could penetrate U.S. missile defenses.

They include Alexander Shiplyuk, 58 years old, a leading specialist in
the field of high-speed aerogasdynamics who last month was sentenced to
15 years in prison. In May, Anatoly Maslov, now 78, a specialist in
high-speed aerodynamics, was sentenced to 14 years in prison on treason
charges after prosecutors accused him of sharing top-secret information
related to Russia's hypersonics research with Germany.

A month earlier, Alexander Kuranov, 76, an eminent physicist who
researched hypersonic propulsion, was convicted of treason for allegedly
"passing over scientific research data to foreign special services,"
Russia's state news agency TASS reported, citing sources. He was
sentenced to seven years in prison.

Exact details of their alleged crimes weren't disclosed. Treason cases
are tried behind closed doors. No information is published in court
dockets because the cases are said to involve state secrets, though some
of the scientists denied any wrongdoing.

**["It's the scientists who do the fundamental research who are being
detained," said Yevgeny Smirnov, a lawyer who represented three accused
scientists---two of whom died following their detention. "They do not
know what armaments are, they have never developed missiles. But yes,
their research can be applied to hypersonics."]{.underline}**

**[A government on edge]{.underline}**

**[The arrests come when the government is already on edge over any
perceived threat and has imposed strict limits on what Russians can say
and do, especially since the start of the war in Ukraine. Increasingly,
authorities are using treason and espionage laws to target critics and
stifle dissent.]{.underline}**

**["[The bar for the state's tolerance]{.mark} for anything contrary to
what it demands and specifies [has become much lower]{.mark}," Davidis
said.]{.underline}**

**[For scientists caught up in the detention wave, it's terrifying, said
Smirnov.]{.underline}**

**["[The fear]{.mark} is [that you can't communicate with
foreigners]{.mark}, you can't go to conferences, you can't develop in
this respect," he said. "This really [has]{.mark} had [a very strong
chilling effect]{.mark} [among scientists."]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Attending international conferences, coordinating with foreign
colleagues and sharing knowledge was encouraged following the demise of
the Soviet Union and the era of glasnost, or openness, that developed in
Russia under former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.

In the early years of Putin's presidency that began in 2000, Russian
scientists participated in many international projects. While serving as
prime minister between 2008 and 2012, Putin signed an agreement with
several different countries, including the U.S., Australia, New Zealand
and European nations, to participate in a global project to study
fundamental high-speed phenomena. Russian institutes were obligated to
participate in this project.

Now that collaboration has come back to haunt the scientists who took
international trips and penned papers in connection with the project,
Russia's Federal Security Service is now investigating "which scientists
can be imprisoned," Smirnov said.

In a since-deleted open letter supporting the three scientists who were
arrested from the Institute of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics,
colleagues praised the men as having "always remained loyal to the
interests of the country."

But, they said, "**[we see that [any article]{.mark} or report [can
become]{.mark} a reason for accusations of
[treason]{.mark}]{.underline}**. What we are awarded for today and set
as an example for others, tomorrow becomes a reason for criminal
prosecution."

An easy target

Viktor Kudryavtsev, an expert on the dynamics of gases and liquids, was
one of the first Russian scientists to be picked up, in 2018.

He faced charges relating to papers containing secret data that he
allegedly sent to the von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics in
Belgium, with which he was collaborating in an international research
project.

"It was one of the European Union programs, which was then supported by
the Russian state," Kudryavtsev's son Yaroslav, a physicist now based in
Paris, said in an interview. "The work of the Russian groups was partly
financed by the Russian government. It was all approved. It was
scientific research."

But his father was an easy target. He was the Russian coordinator for
the project, the younger Kudryavtsev said.

Viktor Kudryavtsev and his wife, Olga, with family members in 2005.

"Scientific information was exchanged through him," Kudryavtsev said.
"He was arrested because he was the person who was passing information
to the Western partners in the project."

A letter of support published by the Belgian von Karman Institute in
October 2019 said the program "very clearly excluded military research"
and it "could not find any trace of disclosing secret information" by
Kudryavtsev's team.

Kudryavtsev's colleague, Roman Kovalev, who worked on the same project,
was also later detained. He collaborated with the Federal Security
Service and testified against several of his colleagues in exchange for
a shorter sentence, said Smirnov, who represented Kudryavtsev.

Like many of the scientists facing treason charges, Kovalev "got scared
and broke down," Smirnov said.

Kovalev was released from prison in April 2022 after falling ill and
died two weeks later. His lawyer couldn't be reached for comment.

Kudryavtsev served a year and three months in pretrial detention. He was
diagnosed with advanced cancer and released. His case was suspended in
August 2020 and he died less than a year later.

Maslov, the scientist sentenced to 14 years in May, regularly traveled
to international conferences. He received many lucrative offers from
foreign organizations to work permanently in the West, according to
interviews that his sons Nikolai and Alexei gave to Russian media. But
he always came home.

Blowback

The suspicion among some observers is that the Russian security agencies
are pursuing these arrests in part "to convince themselves, and to
convince Putin, that Russia has really advanced scientific achievements
and that spies from all over the world are trying to steal them,"
Smirnov said.

If that is the case**[, there could be [unintended consequences]{.mark}.
As the other researchers wait to go to trial, [many scientists already
are too afraid to pursue meaningful research]{.mark} lest they also are
arrested.]{.underline}**

**["This is simply sabotage on the part of the authorities, and it is
first and foremost harmful to Russian science," said Kudryavtsev, who
wants his father's name to be cleared of any wrongdoing.]{.underline}**

**["By trying to maintain secrecy in military research," he said, "[they
are practically killing civilian science]{.mark} in those
areas."]{.underline}**

arrests targeting researchers since the beginning of the war in Ukraine,
in what [experts]{.mark} are [call]{.mark}ing a [politically motivated
crackdown on scientists]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Russian scientists Alexander Shipliouk, Anatoly Maslov, and Valery
Zvegintsev have more in common than just their roles as leading
physicists in hypersonic missile development, one of their country's
technological strengths.

In recent months, all three men have been accused of high treason and
detained by Russian authorities.

On September 3, a Moscow court sentenced Shipliouk, the former director
of the Institute of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (ITAM) in Siberia,
to 15 years in a high-security prison. The closed-door trial found him
guilty of sharing "classified information" at a scientific conference in
China in 2017. Shipliouk claims that the data he presented was already
in the public domain.

His colleague at ITAM, 78-year-old Maslov, who specialises in hypersonic
flight, used the same argument after being sentenced to 14 years in
prison in May. He too was charged with treason for passing on sensitive
information during trips overseas.

Meanwhile, Zvegintsev, another hypersonic expert from the same
institute, was arrested last spring and remains in pre-trial detention.
Russian authorities only confirmed his arrest after a group of Russian
scientists publicly expressed concern for their colleagues in an open
letter published last May.

An escalating crackdown on scientists

Researchers at the Novosibirsk-based ITAM are not the only ones who have
been targeted by Russian authorities. Alexander Kuranov, an engineer who
led a key hypersonic aircraft program in the late Soviet era, was
sentenced to seven years in prison for treason in April 2024 after
spending more than two years in custody.

Since 2018, at least 11 specialists in hypersonic technology have been
detained by Russian authorities, according to the BBC.

The **[crackdown began the year President Vladimir Putin announced that

[determined]{.mark} [to prevent]{.mark} any [leakage of sensitive

**["It looks like [Putin]{.mark} is [trying]{.mark} [to]{.mark} ensure
[control]{.mark} over [every]{.mark} key [bit of knowledge]{.mark},"
Mathers said.]{.underline}**

**[This [crackdown is not without precedent]{.mark} in Russian history.
In 1953, Joseph Stalin\'s regime launched the "doctors\' plot", a
state-sponsored campaign that accused Jewish doctors of conspiring to
kill Soviet leaders and of working with the United States. The recent
wave of arrests suggests a similar climate of paranoia.]{.underline}**

**[\"[Researchers]{.mark}, [who]{.mark} have to [work with]{.mark} the
global [scientific world]{.mark}, [have]{.mark} [always]{.mark}
[been]{.mark} [under suspicion]{.mark} of colluding with western
forces]{.underline}** when the Russian regime becomes more paranoid,\"
Hall said.

Remarkably, the **[crackdown targets not only those suspected of
conniving with the West but also researchers accused of sharing
information with countries considered friendly to Moscow. Shipliouk was
detained following a trip to China, while Zvegintsev was arrested
following the publication of a scientific article in an Iranian
newspaper.]{.underline}**

**["Vladimir [Putin doesn't trust anyone]{.mark}]{.underline}**," said
Mathers.

The arrests also reflect the secret services\' effort to maintain their
relevance by stoking the regime\'s paranoia. \"When you use the charge
of treason, that means the state gives the FSB additional power and the
right to not say anything,\" Mathers explained.

Hall emphasised that the FSB knows how to present itself as
indispensable to the Kremlin. In 2012, FSB director Alexander Bortnikov
claimed that the forest fires in Siberia were the work of al Qaeda
without any proof, using the opportunity to request a budget extension.

Experts suggest that the hypersonic specialists are merely pawns in a
larger game of influence within the Kremlin. However, this strategy
risks backfiring. Isolating itself from the global scientific community
could severely hamper Russian research and technological progress.

**[\"The [main goal]{.mark} [seems to]{.mark} be to [make]{.mark} as
shocking as possible [an example]{.mark} {of these arrests\] [so]{.mark}
that other [scientists]{.mark} [are discouraged]{.mark} [to work with
foreign counterparts]{.mark}]{.underline}**,\" Mathers concluded.

**[On April 22, a meeting of the Russian Security Council for the Arctic
state policy took place in Moscow. During that meeting, they decided
that, [over the next few years, Russia will push for the development of
its Arctic areas]{.mark}, [referring to the creation of new transport
infrastructures]{.mark}, the implementation of large-scale [mining
programs and]{.mark} the [strengthening]{.mark} of its [military
presence]{.mark}. In a separate announcement, Russian President Vladimir
[Putin declared]{.mark} that a new state agency should be created to
implement Russia's policy in the Arctic and thereby improve the quality
of governance and decision-making in the area. The Russian president
made the point [that]{.mark} [the Arctic remained in in Russia's
"special sphere of influence",]{.mark} a region where all aspects of
Russian national security -- from political-military, economic, and
technological aspects -- are concerned.]{.underline}** Indeed, oil and
gas reserves in the Russian Arctic would exceed 1.6 trillion tonnes of
oil equivalent and the continental shelf would contain about a quarter
of all shelf stocks of hydro carbonic raw materials in the world.
Parallel to the production of minerals and the reconstruction of
infrastructures, the development of Arctic transit corridors --
including the Northern Sea Route -- is planned. Thanks to changes in the
Arctic climate more favourable to commercial navigation, cargo transit
on the Northern Sea Route increased twofold since 2010. As a result,
this route has become increasingly attractive, especially since the
transit from the Japanese port of Yokohama to Rotterdam is almost twice
as short as the traditional international route through the Suez Canal.
In order to protect the country's interests and regional borders, Russia
will build a unified network of naval facilities on its Arctic
territories in order to host advanced warships and submarines. The Army
is also planning to form a new strategic military command in the Arctic.
Plans to reopen airfields and ports on the New Siberian Islands and the
Franz Josef Land archipelago have also been announced. It needs to be
reminded that Russia has been seeking to reinforce its military presence
in the Arctic for some time now and it was already mentioned back in
2009 in the Basic Concept of State Policy in the Arctic. In the context
of existing and potentially new sanctions against Russia over the
Ukrainian crisis, the tilt of Russia towards the Asian markets seems
inevitable. Furthermore, while taking in consideration the interest of
certain Asian countries in the Arctic (and especially concerning the
Northern Sea Route), this has become a new vector of Russia's Asian
foreign policy. This vector is supposed to integrate Russian and Asian
economies through a regional integration process in the Russian Oriental
bloc. China, once again, is the cornerstone of Moscow's strategy:
indeed, Beijing is particularly interested in standing in the Arctic
race in terms of economic outlets and potential growth drivers. In this
context, the Ukrainian crisis is affecting Russia's arctic strategy
within the Arctic Council. Canada, holder of the rotating presidency of
the Arctic Council until May 2015, already refused to take part in the
meeting of the working group of the Council in Moscow in mid-April.
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper had announced on April 17 the
sending of six new CF-18 aircraft in Lask in Poland under the Nato

[**After a period of substantial demilitarization in the Arctic after
the Cold War, we are now witnessing a growing recognition of the new
strategic significance of a region where security, economics, politics
and ecology interact. First of all, according to the U.S. Geological
Survey, the Arctic is a potential key petroleum-bearing region holding
one-quarter of the world's remaining undiscovered oil and gas deposits,
in particular, as much as 90 billion barrels of oil and 1.670 trillion
cubic feet of natural gas. Secondly, new sea lanes will be created by
the great melt of Arctic ice, meaning the Arctic Ocean will soon be free
of ice for most of the year. Thirdly, the region is militarily
significant, as the Arctic Ocean and its shores remain a highly
militarized zone of confrontation. However, the legal status of much of
the Arctic is unclear, and all five Arctic powers (Russia, the USA,
Canada, Norway and Denmark) have different territorial claims.** **It
seems important to focus on [the Arctic policy of the USA and
Russia]{.mark}, as [relations between these two countries will have a
profound impact on the future of the Arctic]{.mark}**.]{.underline}¶
**[According to [Russia's strategy in the Arctic]{.mark}, "in a
competition for resources, [it cannot be ruled out that military force
could be used for resolving emerging problems]{.mark}," with the Arctic
shelf being regarded as a potential battleground. By undertaking
flag-planting expeditions and building up its military forces, [Russia
is making the point that large parts of the Arctic lie within Russia's
natural sphere of influence.]{.mark}]{.underline}**¶ **[[Moscow sends
signals to other powers, most obviously the U.S., to respect Russian
natural interests there]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Washington, as well as
Moscow, has vital assets in the region, including Prudhoe Bay and other
oil and gas fields of the Alaskan coast. However, the U.S. Senate has
not ratified the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, UNCLOS, the basic
international treaty on maritime rights, and some American experts call
for internationalization of the region. In order to analyze future of
the Arctic we should answer two questions Will the Arctic be a zone of
cooperation or competition (x-axis)? Will the USA and Russia conduct
militarization or demilitarization policies (y-axis)? This can be
represented graphically, as shown here: Infographic by Natalia
Mikhaylenko Infographic by Natalia Mikhaylenko With Future 4 being a
unrealistic scenario, as no state is likely to conduct a policy of
demilitarization during confrontation in the region, it is possible to
elaborate on three possible scenarios for the Arctic. 1)
Militarization-competition (Future 1) Military conflict can be provoked
because of significant economic and strategic stakes in an area where
boundaries of maritime jurisdiction remain to be settled. Diplomatic
gridlock may lead the region to erupt in an armed mad dash for its
resources. There are a number of driving factors of this scenario:
growing military activity, inflammatory rhetoric, and closer security
coordination among the Western powers. Moreover, the Arctic countries
are likely to grab territory unilaterally and exert sovereign control
over sea lanes by arming icebreakers and military troops to guard their
claims. This scenario of a real cold war is substantiated by some recent
facts. The Russians recently ordered strategic bomber flights over the
Arctic Ocean for the first time since the Cold War. Moreover, Russian
armed forces have regularly tested air and sea defenses of NATO in the
region. Finally, the NATO alliance often organizes military exercises
with warships and strategic bombers, supported by tankers,
reconnaissance aircraft and escort fighters.

understanding]{.underline}** **[deeply rooted]{.underline}** **[notions
of]{.underline}** **[contemporary Russian
identity]{.underline}**]{.mark} and even its domestic political system.
For most of the second half of the twentieth century the United States
and the Soviet Union were locked in a competitive struggle for global
power and hegemony, and each country viewed its adversary as the
principal "other" around which much of each country's identity and
foreign policy revolved. The collapse of the Soviet Union was a searing
event for citizens of Russia as well as the other newly sovereign states
of the region, **[yet [for most policymakers and elites in Moscow old
habits of measuring success or failure through a U.S.-centric prism have
endured.]{.mark} Now, nearly 20 years past the Soviet collapse,
[perceptions of the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates probably
[remain]{.mark} more [significant for Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}** than
for any other country in this study. As in other countries in this
study, the dominant paradigm for Russian government officials and
political elite is realism with probably a higher relative weight for
the value of economic and military indices of power and lower relative
weight for factors of soft power. In the traditional Russian calculus
(czarist, Soviet, and post-Soviet), it is not the power of attraction
that dominates; instead, it is the power of coercion, typically through
intimidation or buying support---a very hard-edged realism. When
Westerners emphasize values such as human rights and democracy, the
default Russian reaction is deep skepticism that their interlocutors,
especially the Americans, are being disingenuous. U.S. promotion of
democracy, liberal capitalism, a rules-based system of global
governance, and the like is interpreted as a collection of ideological
fig leaves designed to conceal the naked U.S. ambition to expand its own
power and influence abroad.

Gazprom sent its first shipment of oil from its controversial Russian
Arctic offshore platform on April 18, a landmark event that Russian
President Vladimir Putin said would contribute to economic growth. \"The
start of loading the oil produced at Prirazlomnaya means that the entire
project will exert a most encouraging influence on Russia\'s presence on
the energy markets and will stimulate the Russian economy in general and
its energy sector in particular,\" he said. Putin was on hand to witness
to first shipment of 70,000 tonnes of oil, which was loaded onto a
tanker from the Prirazlomnoye platform, the same rig boarded by
Greenpeace activists last fall. Despite opposition from
environmentalists, **[[Putin stated]{.mark} that this is merely the
beginning, [\"this is,]{.mark} in fact, [the beginning of our country\'s
enormous work on oil production in the Arctic.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}**
The Arctic theoretically holds 30% of the world\'s remaining
undiscovered oil and gas resources. Nearly 84% of the 90 billion barrels
of oil are located offshore. While Royal Dutch Shell\'s bad missteps
have all but killed off the Arctic oil program in the United States,
[**[Russia is moving ahead, and Putin clearly believes that the Arctic
is an essential ingredient in its ability to maintain its position as
one of the world\'s largest oil producers]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Russia
gets 52% of its budget revenues from oil and gas, as well as 70% of its
export earnings. In 2012 Russia produced an estimated 10.4 million
barrels of oil per day with nearly two-thirds of that total coming from
Western Siberia. But many of Russia\'s oil fields, which have been in
operation for years, are starting to decline. This has Putin looking to
expand in the Arctic. Rosneft signed a deal with ExxonMobil to develop
parts of the Arctic, a move that suggests that Russia needs the
technological prowess from international oil companies to access remote
Arctic oil fields. But, while much has been made about the Arctic energy
frontier - with headlines about how Russia is \"beating\" the U.S. in
Arctic oil development - Russia\'s Arctic prize won\'t be as big as many
think. The Prirazlomnoye field, which just started production, holds an
estimated 530 million barrels of oil. The project is costly and would
not have been economical if the Russian government had not granted it
special tax breaks. But, even with heavy backing by the government,
Gazprom estimates that the field will only be producing 120,000 barrels
of oil per day, beginning in 2020. That would only add about 1% to
Russia\'s oil production. Rosneft\'s projects aren\'t expected to come
online for at least another decade. Gazprom also wants to develop the
giant Shtokman gas field, but that has been repeatedly put on ice due to
high costs. On the whole, the Arctic suffers from high costs, severe
weather, and a lack of infrastructure, all of which will make it
exceedingly difficult for Russia to turn the region into a major source
of oil production. Still, **[[mistrust and fear are likely contributing
to]{.mark} a minor military buildup and [the erosion of good
relations]{.mark} in a region that up until now represented one of the
few brightspots for international cooperation. This is no doubt being
drastically exacerbated by the Ukraine crisis, but [a zero-sum mentality
over seizing the upper hand in a new region being opened up by melting
ice]{.mark} seemingly [pervades]{.mark} the capitals of the [Arctic
powers]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The U.S. Navy recently announced that it
would send a greater presence to the Arctic in the coming years. The
Navy also cancelled a joint exercise with Russia in the region in
response to Russia\'s actions in Ukraine. Russia is also calling for a
military buildup in the Arctic. More recently, Canada decided to boycott
a meeting of the Arctic Council in Moscow in response to the Kremlin\'s
actions in Ukraine. Canada is currently holding the rotating chair of
the council, and has been particularly aggressive in denouncing
Russia\'s actions in Ukraine. In early April, former Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton said that Canada and the U.S. should form a \"united
front\" against expansionist moves by Russia in the Arctic. She warned
against Russia\'s military buildup in the region. While the Ukraine
crisis may be currently driving events in the Arctic, both Russia and
the West fear losing out to the other in the far north, despite what
appears to be a small prize.

The proper starting point in thinking about American national interests
and Russia---or any other country---is the candid question: why does
Russia matter?  How can Russia affect vital American interests and how
much should the United States care about Russia?  Where does it rank in
the hierarchy of American national interests? As the Report of
the *Commission on American National Interests* (2000) concluded, Russia
ranks among the few countries whose actions powerfully affect American
vital interests. Why? First, **[Russia is a very large country linking
several strategically important regions]{.underline}**. By virtue of its
size and location, Russia is a key player in Europe as well as the
Middle East and Central, South and East Asia. Accordingly, **[[Moscow
can substantially contribute to, or detract from, U.S. efforts to deal
with]{.mark} such urgent challenges as [No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea and
[Iran, as well as]{.mark} important longer term problems like Iraq and
[Afghanistan]{.mark}. In addition, Russia shares the world's longest
land border with China, an emerging great power]{.underline}** that can
have a major impact on both U.S. and Russian interests. The bottom line
is that notwithstanding its significant loss of power after the end of
the Cold War, Moscow's geopolitical weight still exceeds that of London
or Paris. Second, as a result of its Soviet legacy, **[[Russia has
relationships]{.mark} with and information about countries [that remain
comparatively inaccessible to the American government]{.mark}, in the
Middle East, Central Asia and elsewhere. [Russian intel]{.mark}ligence
and/or leverage in these areas [could significantly aid the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [in its efforts to deal with]{.mark}
current, emerging and still unforeseen strategic challenges, including
in the war on [terrorism.]{.mark} Third, today [and]{.mark} for the
foreseeable future [Russia's]{.mark} [nuclear arsenal]{.mark} will be
capable of inflicting vast damage on the United States.]{.underline}**
Fortunately, the likelihood of such scenarios has declined dramatically
since the Cold War. But today and as far as any eye can see the U.S.
will have an enduring vital interest in these weapons not being used
against America or our allies. Fourth, reliable Russian stewardship and
control of the largest arsenal of nuclear warheads and stockpile of
nuclear materials from which nuclear weapons could be made is essential
in combating the threat of "loose nukes." The United States has a vital
interest in effective Russian programs to prevent weapons being stolen
by criminals, sold to terrorists and used to kill Americans. Fifth,
Russian stockpiles, technologies and knowledge for creating biological
and chemical weapons make cooperation with Moscow very important to U.S.
efforts to prevent proliferation of these weapons. Working with Russia
may similarly help to prevent states hostile to the United States from
obtaining sophisticated conventional weapons systems, such as missiles
and submarines. Sixth, as the world's largest producer and exporter of
hydrocarbons (oil and gas), Russia offers America an opportunity to
diversify and increase supplies of non-OPEC, non-Mid-Eastern energy.
Seventh, as a veto-wielding permanent member of the United Nations
Security Council, Russia can substantially ease, or complicate, American
attempts to work through the UN and other international institutions to
advance other vital and extremely important U.S. interests. In a world
in which many are already concerned about the use of U.S. power, this
can have a real impact on America's success at providing global
leadership. More broadly, a close U.S.-Russian relationship can limit
other states' behavior by effectively eliminating Moscow as a potential
source of political support.

**Terrorism causes [extinction]{.underline} --- retaliation**

Science at Purdue University, 2019 (*Terrorism and Global Security: The
Nuclear Threat Second Edition, Completely Revised And Updated* Published
in July 2019 by Routledge)

**[[Nuc]{.mark}lear [terror]{.mark}ism could even [spark full-scale
nuclear war]{.mark} between states. Such war could involve the entire
spectrum of nuclear conflict possibilities, ranging from a. nuclear
attack upon a nonnuclear state to systemwide nuclear war. How might such
far-reaching consequences of nuclear terrorism come about? Perhaps the
most likely way would involve a terrorist nuclear assault against a
state by terrorists \"hosted\" in another state. For example, consider
the following scenario:]{.underline}**

**[Early in the 1980s, Israel and her Arab state neighbors finally stand
ready to conclude a comprehensive, multilateral peace settlement. With a
bilateral treaty between Israel and Egypt already several years old,
only the interests of the Palestinians---as defined by the PLO--- seem
to have been left out. On the eve of the proposed signing of the peace
agreement, half a dozen crude nuclear explosives in the one kiloton
range detonate in as many Israeli cities. Public grief in Israel over
the many thousand dead and maimed is matched only by the outcry for
revenge. [In response]{.mark} to the public mood, [the
government]{.mark} of Israel initiates selected [strikes]{.mark} against
[terrorist strongholds]{.mark} in Lebanon, whereupon the Lebanese
government and its allies retaliate against Israel. Before long,
[the]{.mark} entire [region is ablaze, conflict]{.mark} has
[escalate]{.mark}d [to nuclear]{.mark} forms, and all countries in the
area have suffered unprecedented destruction.]{.underline}**

**[Of course, such a scenario is fraught with the makings of even wider
destruction. How would [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[react]{.mark} to the situation in the Middle East? What would be the
Soviet response? It is certainly conceivable that [a chain reaction of
interstate nuclear conflict could ensue]{.mark}, one [that]{.mark} would
ultimately [involve]{.mark} the superpowers or even [every
nuclear]{.mark} weapon [state]{.mark} on the planet.]{.underline}**

**[What, exactly, would this mean? Whether the terms of assessment be
statistical or human, the consequences of nuclear war require an
entirely new paradigm of death. Only such a paradigm would allow us a
proper framework for absorbing the vision of near-total obliteration and
the outer limits of human destructiveness. Any nuclear war would have
effectively permanent and irreversible consequences. Whatever the actual
extent of injuries and fatalities, it [would entomb]{.mark} the spirit
of [the entire species]{.mark} in a planetary casket strewn with shorn
bodies and imbecile imaginations.]{.underline}**

This would be **[as true]{.underline}** [for a]{.underline}
**[\"limited\"]{.underline}** nuclear [war as]{.underline} for
[an]{.underline} **[\"unlimited\"]{.underline}** [one]{.underline}.
Contrary to continuing Pentagon commitments to the idea of selected
\"counterforce\" strikes that would reduce the chances for escalation
and produce fewer civilian casualties, the strategy of limited nuclear
war is inherently unreasonable. There is, in fact, no clear picture of
what states might hope to gain from counterforce attacks. This
understanding is reflected by Soviet military strategy, which is founded
on the idea that any nuclear conflict would necessarily be unlimited.

Nuclear War Between the Superpowers

The consequences of a strategic exchange between the United States and
the Soviet Union have been the object of widespread attention. One
account of these consequences is offered by Andrei D. Sakharov, the
brilliant physicist who played a leading role in the development of
Russia\'s thermonuclear capacity:

A complete destruction of cities, industry, transport, and systems of
education, a poisoning of fields, water, and air by radioactivity, a
physical destruction of the larger part of mankind, poverty, barbarism,
a return to savagery, and a genetic degeneracy of the survivors under
the impact of radiation, a destruction of the material and information
basis of civilization---this is a measure of the peril that threatens
the world as a result of the estrangement of the world\'s two
superpowers. 13

Presently, U.S. strategic arsenals contain approximately 9,000 strategic
weapons and 4,000 megaton equivalents. Soviet strategic forces number
approximately 3,000 weapons and about 5,000 megaton equivalents.14 An
exchange involving any substantial fraction of these forces could
promptly destroy more than half of the urban populations in both
countries. The subsequent fallout could be expected to kill upwards of
50 percent of the surviving rural inhabitants as well as create
worldwide contamination of the atmosphere.15

To better understand the effects of fallout, it is useful to recognize
that radiation effects have three basic forms: (1) radiation directly
from the explosion; (2) immediate radioactive fallout (first twenty-four
hours); and (3) long-term fallout (months and years). In areas where
radioactive fallout is of particularly high intensity, individuals will
be exposed to high doses of radiation regardless of shelter protection.
Those who do not become prompt or short-term fatalities and have
suffered radiation exposures above 100 REMs will undergo hemo tological
(blood system) alterations that diminish immunological capabilities. The
resultant vulnerability to infection will seriously impair prospects for
long-term recovery.

The effects of a nuclear war between the superpowers, however, cannot be
understood solely in terms of projected casualties. Rather, these
effects must also include quantitative effects (i.e., availability of
productive capacity, fuel, labor, food, and other resources);
qualitative effects (i.e., political, social, and psychological damage);
and interactive effects (i.e., the impact on the relationships between
the social and economic factors of production).17 When these corollary
effects are taken into account, it is easy to see that policy makers and
public alike have typically understated the aggregate impact of nuclear
war.

This point is supported by a 1975 study of the National Research
Council, National Academy of Sciences, entitled Long- Term Worldwide
Effects of Multiple Nuclear Weapons Detonations. Going beyond the usual
litany of crude physical measures of destruction (e.g., number of human
fatalities, number of cities destroyed), the report portrays the
long-term, worldwide effects following a hypothetical exchange of 10,000
megatons of explosive power in the northern hemisphere. These effects
are cast in terms of atmosphere and climate, natural terrestrial
ecosystems, agriculture and animal husbandry, the aquatic environment,
and both somatic and genetic changes in human populations.

While the report recognizes that the biosphere and the species Homo
sapiens would survive the hypothesized nuclear war, it recognizes that
the very idea of survival in such a context is problematic. Building
upon this recognition, a more recent study prepared for the Joint
Committee on Defense Production of the Congress---Economic and Social
Consequences of Nuclear Attacks on the United States---identifies four
discrete levels of postattack survival. This new taxonomy permits a more
subtle look at the interactive effects of nuclear war and allows more
precise judgments about the acceptability or unacceptability of nuclear
attack damage. According to the study, there are four levels of
survival, in decreasing order of damage.

1\. Biological Survival of Individuals. Individuals or groups of
individuals survive but not necessarily within the organized political,
social, and economic structure of a modern society.

2\. Regional Survival of Political Structures. Some subnational
political units survive as viable entities, but without a functioning
central government.

3\. Survival of a Central Government. Some form of viable, central
control over all preattack national territory survives, but the
effectiveness of this control may vary over an extremely wide range,
depending on the specific nature and pattern of the attack(s).

4\. Survival Intact of Basic Societal Structure. Damage to the nation is
characterized as relatively limited socially, politically and
economically; nevertheless, the attack is militarily destructive. This
is the concept of survival envisioned in the notion of limited or
controlled nuclear war. However, it should be noted that the idea that
effective strategic military attacks can be benign in their impacts on
society is in dispute. It is used here as a criterion without any
implicit acceptance that it can be achieved. 19

There are, however, levels of strategic exchange at which even the first
listed category of survival might not be relevant. At such levels, the
species itself---let alone organized political, social, and economic
structures---would disappear. The plausibility of such levels is
underscored by the fact that the magnitude of exchange postulated in the
NAS report is really quite low. Were the superpowers to exchange between
50,000 and 100,000 megatons of nuclear explosives, rather than the
10,000 megatons assumed by the report, worldwide climatological changes
would imperil the physical existence of Homo sapiens.

Worldwide Nuclear War

If nuclear terrorism should lead to worldwide nuclear war,
[the]{.underline} **[results]{.underline}** [would represent
humankind\'s **last and most complete calamity**, defying not only
our]{.underline} **[imaginations]{.underline}** [of disaster, but
our]{.underline} [**customary measurements as well**. As the culmination
of]{.underline} what Camus once described as \"**[years]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} absolutely [**insane history**,\" worldwide nuclear war
would represent the]{.underline} **[final eradication of the very
boundaries of annihilation]{.underline}**.

In technical terms, the consequences of systemwide nuclear war would
**[include [atmospheric effects; effects on]{.mark} natural terrestrial
[ecosystems]{.mark}; effects on managed terrestrial ecosystems; and
effects on the aquatic environment.]{.underline}**

**[Atmospheric effects would be highlighted by greatly [reduced
ozone]{.mark} concentrations producing increased ultraviolet radiation
and a drop in average temperature. Even the possibility of irreversible
climatic shifts cannot be ruled out.]{.underline}**

**[Natural Terrestrial Ecosystems would be affected by systemwide
nuclear war through three principal stress factors: ionizing radiation;
uv-B radiation; and climatic change. [The cumulative effect]{.mark} of
these three factors would [render the entire planet a \"hot
spot\"]{.mark}]{.underline}** where even vast forests would
[show]{.underline} physiological and **[genetic damage]{.underline}**.21

Managed Terrestrial Ecosystems would be affected by systemwide nuclear
war by radionuclide contamination of foods, chromosome breakage and gene
mutations in crops, and yield-reducing sterility in seed crops.
[The]{.underline} **[cumulative effect]{.underline}** of these changes
[would be the]{.underline} **[disappearance]{.underline}** [of
the]{.underline} **[tech]{.underline}**nology **[base for
ag]{.underline}**riculture. Even if there were any significant 11
survivors, a return to normal world food production would be
unimaginable.22

Aquatic effects of a systemwide nuclear war would stem from ionizing
radiation from radionuclides in marine waters and fresh waters; solar uv
radiation; and changes in water temperatures associated with climate.
**[Irreversible injuries]{.underline}** to sensitive aquatic species
[could be anticipated]{.underline} during the years of large transient
increase in uv-B isolation. And the range of geographic distribution of
sensitive populations of aquatic organisms could be reduced.23

Accessed: 5/21/25)

The escalating threats between North Korea and the United States make it
easy to forget the "nuclear nightmare," as former US Secretary of
Defense William J. Perry put it, that could result even from the use of
just a single terrorist nuclear bomb in the heart of a major city. At
the risk of repeating the vast literature on the tragedies of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki---and the substantial literature surrounding nuclear tests
and simulations since then---**[we attempt to spell out here the likely
consequences of the explosion of [a single terrorist nuclear
bomb]{.mark} on a major city, and its subsequent ripple effects on the
rest of the planet. Depending on where and when it was detonated, the
blast, fire, initial radiation, and long-term radioactive fallout from
such a bomb could leave the heart of a major city a smoldering
radioactive ruin, killing tens or hundreds of thousands of people and
wounding hundreds of thousands more. Vast areas would have to be
evacuated and might be uninhabitable for years. Economic, political, and
social aftershocks [would ripple throughout the
world]{.mark}]{.underline}**. A single terrorist nuclear bomb would
change history. The country attacked---and the world---would never be
the same. The idea of terrorists accomplishing such a thing is,
unfortunately, not out of the question; **[it is far easier to make a
crude, unsafe, unreliable nuclear explosive that might fit in the back
of a truck than it is to make a safe, reliable weapon of known yield
that can be delivered by missile or combat aircraft. [Numerous]{.mark}
government [studies]{.mark} have [concluded]{.mark} that [it is
plausible]{.mark} that a sophisticated terrorist group could make a
crude bomb if they got the needed nuclear material. And in the last
quarter century, there have been some 20 seizures of stolen,
weapons-usable nuclear material, and at least two terrorist groups have
made significant efforts to acquire nuclear bombs. Terrorist use of an
actual nuclear bomb is a low-probability event---but the
[immensity]{.mark} of the consequences [means]{.mark} that [even a small
chance is enough to justify an intensive effort]{.mark} to reduce the
risk]{.underline}**. Fortunately, since the early 1990s, countries
around the world have significantly reduced the danger---but **[it
remains very real, and there is more to do to ensure this nightmare
never becomes reality. Brighter than a thousand suns. Imagine a crude
terrorist nuclear bomb---containing a chunk of highly enriched uranium
just under the size of a regulation bowling ball, or a much smaller
chunk of plutonium---suddenly detonating inside a delivery van parked in
the heart of a major city. Such a terrorist bomb would release as much
as 10 kilotons of explosive energy, or the equivalent of 10,000 tons of
conventional explosives, a volume of explosives large enough to fill all
the cars of a mile-long train]{.underline}**. In a millionth of a
second, all of that energy would be released inside that small ball of
nuclear material, **[creating temperatures and pressures as high as
those at the center of the sun. That furious energy would explode
outward, releasing its energy in three main ways: a powerful blast wave;
intense heat; and deadly radiation. The ball would expand almost
instantly into a fireball the width of four football fields,
incinerating essentially everything and everyone within. The heated
fireball would rise, sucking in air from below and expanding above,
creating the mushroom cloud that has become the symbol of the terror of
the nuclear age. The ionized plasma in the fireball would create a
localized electromagnetic pulse more powerful than lightning, shorting
out communications and electronics nearby]{.underline}**---though most
would be destroyed by the bomb's other effects in any case. (Estimates
of heat, blast, and radiation effects in this article are drawn
primarily from Alex Wellerstein's "Nukemap," which itself comes from
declassified US government data, such as the 660-page government
textbook The Effects of Nuclear Weapons.) **[At the instant of its
detonation, the bomb would also release an intense burst of gamma and
neutron radiation which would be lethal for nearly everyone directly
exposed within about two-thirds of a mile from the center of the
blast]{.underline}**. (Those who happened to be shielded by being
inside, or having buildings between them and the bomb, would be partly
protected---in some cases, reducing their doses by ten times or more.)
The nuclear flash from the heat of the fireball would radiate in both
visible light and the infrared; it would be "brighter than a thousand
suns," in the words of the title of a book describing the development of
nuclear weapons---adapting a phrase from the Hindu epic the
Bhagavad-Gita. Anyone who looked directly at the blast would be blinded.
[**The heat from the fireball would ignite fires and horribly burn
everyone exposed outside at distances of nearly a mile
away**.]{.underline} (In the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum, visitors gaze
in horror at the bones of a human hand embedded in glass melted by the
bomb.) No one has burned a city on that scale in the decades since World
War II, so it is difficult to predict the full extent of the fire damage
that would occur from the explosion of a nuclear bomb in one of today's
cities. Modern glass, steel, and concrete buildings would presumably be
less flammable than the wood-and-rice-paper housing of Hiroshima or
Nagasaki in the 1940s---but many questions remain, including exactly how
thousands of broken gas lines might contribute to fire damage (as they
did in Dresden during World War II). On 9/11, the buildings of the World
Trade Center proved to be much more vulnerable to fire damage than had
been expected. Ultimately, **[even a crude terrorist nuclear bomb would
carry the possibility that the countless fires touched off by the
explosion would coalesce into a devastating firestorm, as occurred at
Hiroshima. In a firestorm, the rising column of hot air from the massive
fire sucks in the air from all around, creating hurricane-force winds;
everything flammable and everything alive within the firestorm would be
consumed. The fires and the dust from the blast would make it extremely
difficult for either rescuers or survivors to see. [The explosion would
create a powerful blast wave]{.mark} rushing out [in every
direction]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For more than a quarter-mile all
around the blast, the pulse of pressure would be over 20 pounds per
square inch above atmospheric pressure (known as "overpressure"),
destroying or severely damaging even sturdy buildings. The combination
of blast, heat, and radiation would kill virtually everyone in this
zone. The blast would be accompanied by winds of many hundreds of miles
per hour. The damage from the explosion would extend far beyond this
inner zone of almost total death. Out to more than half a mile, the
blast would be strong enough to collapse most residential buildings and
create a serious danger that office buildings would topple over, killing
those inside and those in the path of the rubble. (On the other hand,
the office towers of a modern city would tend to block the blast wave in
some areas, providing partial protection from the blast, as well as from
the heat and radiation.) In that zone, almost anything made of wood
would be destroyed: Roofs would cave in, windows would shatter, gas
lines would rupture. Telephone poles, street lamps, and utility lines
would be severely damaged. Many roads would be blocked by mountains of
wreckage. In this zone, many people would be killed or injured in
building collapses, or trapped under the rubble; many more would be
burned, blinded, or injured by flying debris. In many cases, their
charred skin would become ragged and fall off in sheets. The effects of
the detonation would act in deadly synergy. The smashed materials of
buildings broken by the blast would be far easier for the fires to
ignite than intact structures. The effects of radiation would make it
far more difficult for burned and injured people to recover. The
combination of burns, radiation, and physical injuries would cause far
more death and suffering than any one of them would alone. The silent
killer. The bomb's immediate effects would be followed by a slow,
lingering killer: radioactive fallout. A bomb detonated at ground level
would dig a huge crater, hurling tons of earth and debris thousands of
feet into the sky. Sucked into the rising fireball, these particles
would mix with the radioactive remainders of the bomb, and over the next
few hours or days, the debris would rain down for miles downwind.
Depending on weather and wind patterns, the fallout could actually be
deadlier and make a far larger area unusable than the blast itself.
Acute radiation sickness from the initial radiation pulse and the
fallout would likely affect tens of thousands of people. Depending on
the dose, they might suffer from vomiting, watery diarrhea, fever,
sores, loss of hair, and bone marrow depletion. Some would survive; some
would die within days; some would take months to die. Cancer rates among
the survivors would rise. Women would be more vulnerable than
men---children and infants especially so. Much of the radiation from a
nuclear blast is short-lived; radiation levels even a few days after the
blast would be far below those in the first hours. For those not killed
or terribly wounded by the initial explosion, the best advice would be
to take shelter in a basement for at least several days. But many would
be too terrified to stay. Thousands of panic-stricken people might
receive deadly doses of radiation as they fled from their homes. Some of
the radiation will be longer-lived; areas most severely affected would
have to be abandoned for many years after the attack. The combination of
radioactive fallout and the devastation of nearly all life-sustaining
infrastructure over a vast area would mean that hundreds of thousands of
people would have to evacuate. Ambulances to nowhere. The explosion
would also destroy much of the city's ability to respond. Hospitals
would be leveled, doctors and nurses killed and wounded, ambulances
destroyed. (In Hiroshima, 42 of 45 hospitals were destroyed or severely
damaged, and 270 of 300 doctors were killed.) Resources that survived
outside the zone of destruction would be utterly overwhelmed. Hospitals
have no ability to cope with tens or hundreds of thousands of terribly
burned and injured people all at once; the United States, for example,
has 1,760 burn beds in hospitals nationwide, of which a third are
available on any given day. And the problem would not be limited to
hospitals; firefighters, for example, would have little ability to cope
with thousands of fires raging out of control at once. Fire stations and
equipment would be destroyed in the affected area, and firemen killed,
along with police and other emergency responders. Some of the first
responders may become casualties themselves, from radioactive fallout,
fire, and collapsing buildings. Over much of the affected area,
**[[communications would be destroyed]{.underline}]{.mark}**, by both
the physical effects and the electromagnetic pulse from the explosion.
Better preparation for such a disaster could save thousands of
lives---but ultimately, there is no way any city can genuinely be
prepared for a catastrophe on such a historic scale, occurring in a
flash, with zero warning. Rescue and recovery attempts would be impeded
by the destruction of most of the needed personnel and equipment, and by
fire, debris, radiation, fear, lack of communications, and the immense
scale of the disaster. The US military and the national guard could
provide critically important capabilities---but federal plans assume
that "no significant federal response" would be available for 24-to-72
hours. Many of those burned and injured would wait in vain for help,
food, or water, perhaps for days. The scale of death and suffering. How
many would die in such an event, and how many would be terribly wounded,
would depend on where and when the bomb was detonated, what the weather
conditions were at the time, how successful the response was in helping
the wounded survivors, and more. Many estimates of casualties are based
on census data, which reflect where people sleep at night; if the attack
occurred in the middle of a workday, the numbers of people crowded into
the office towers at the heart of many modern cities would be far
higher. The daytime population of Manhattan, for example, is roughly
twice its nighttime population; in Midtown on a typical workday, there
are an estimated 980,000 people per square mile. A 10-kiloton weapon
detonated there might well kill half a million people---not counting
those who might die of radiation sickness from the fallout. (These
effects were analyzed in great detail in the Rand Corporation's
Considering the Effects of a Catastrophic Terrorist Attack and the
British Medical Journal's "Nuclear terrorism.") On a typical day, the
wind would blow the fallout north, seriously contaminating virtually all
of Manhattan above Gramercy Park; people living as far away as Stamford,
Connecticut would likely have to evacuate. Seriously injured survivors
would greatly outnumber the dead, their suffering magnified by the
complete inadequacy of available help. The psychological and social
effects---overwhelming sadness, depression, post-traumatic stress
disorder, myriad forms of anxiety---would be profound and long-lasting.
The scenario we have been describing is a groundburst. An
airburst---such as might occur, for example, if terrorists put their
bomb in a small aircraft they had purchased or rented---would extend the
blast and fire effects over a wider area, killing and injuring even
larger numbers of people immediately. But an airburst would not have the
same lingering effects from fallout as a groundburst, because the rock
and dirt would not be sucked up into the fireball and contaminated. The
10-kiloton blast we have been discussing is likely toward the high end
of what terrorists could plausibly achieve with a crude, improvised
bomb, but even a 1-kiloton blast would be a catastrophic event, having a
deadly radius between one-third and one-half that of a 10-kiloton blast.
These hundreds of thousands of people would not be mere statistics, but
countless individual stories of loss---parents, children, entire
families; all religions; rich and poor alike---killed or horribly
mutilated. Human suffering and tragedy on this scale does not have to be
imagined; it can be remembered through the stories of the survivors of
the US atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the only times in
history when nuclear weapons have been used intentionally against human
beings. The pain and suffering caused by those bombings are almost
beyond human comprehension; the eloquent testimony of the
Hibakusha---the survivors who passed through the atomic fire---should
stand as an eternal reminder of the need to prevent nuclear weapons from
ever being used in anger again. Global economic disaster. **[[The
economic impact]{.mark} of such an attack [would be enormous]{.mark}.
The effects would reverberate for so far and so long that they are
difficult to estimate in all their complexity. Hundreds of thousands of
people would be too injured or sick to work for weeks or months.
Hundreds of thousands more would evacuate to locations far from their
jobs. Many places of employment would have to be abandoned because of
the radioactive fallout. [Insurance companies would reel]{.mark} under
the losses; but at the same time, many insurance policies exclude the
effects of nuclear attacks---an item insurers considered beyond their
ability to cover---so the owners of thousands of buildings would not
have the insurance payments needed to cover the cost of fixing them,
[thousands]{.mark} of companies would [go bankrupt]{.mark}, and banks
would be left holding an immense number of mortgages that would never be
repaid. [Consumer and investor confidence would]{.mark} likely [be
dramatically affected]{.mark}, as worried people slowed their spending.
Enormous new homeland security and military investments would be very
likely]{.underline}**. If the bomb had come in a shipping container, the
targeted country---and possibly others---might stop all containers from
entering until it could devise a system for ensuring they could never
again be used for such a purpose, throwing a wrench into the gears of
global trade for an extended period. (And this might well occur even if
a shipping container had not been the means of delivery.) Even the far
smaller 9/11 attacks are estimated to have caused economic aftershocks
costing almost \$1 trillion even excluding the multi-trillion-dollar
costs of the wars that ensued. The cost of a terrorist nuclear attack in
a major city would likely be many times higher. The most severe effects
would be local, but the effects of trade disruptions, reduced economic
activity, and more would reverberate around the world. Consequently,
while some countries may feel that nuclear terrorism is only a concern
for the countries most likely to be targeted---such as the United
States---in reality it is a threat to everyone, everywhere. In 2005,
then-UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan warned that these global effects
would push "tens of millions of people into dire poverty," creating "a
second death toll throughout the developing world." One recent estimate
suggested that a nuclear attack in an urban area would cause a global
recession, cutting global Gross Domestic Product by some two percent,
and pushing an additional 30 million people in the developing world into
extreme poverty. Desperate dilemmas. In short, an act of nuclear
terrorism could rip the heart out of a major city, and cause ripple
effects throughout the world. The government of the country attacked
would face desperate decisions: How to help the city attacked? How to
prevent further attacks? How to respond or retaliate?
Terrorists---either those who committed the attack or others---would
probably claim they had more bombs already hidden in other cities
(whether they did or not), and threaten to detonate them unless their
demands were met. The fear that this might be true could lead people to
flee major cities in a large-scale, uncontrolled evacuation. There is
very little ability to support the population of major cities in the
surrounding countryside. The potential for widespread havoc and economic
chaos is very real. If the detonation took place in the capital of the
nation attacked, much of the government might be destroyed. A bomb in
Washington, D.C., for example, might kill the President, the Vice
President, and many of the members of Congress and the Supreme Court.
(Having some plausible national leader survive is a key reason why one
cabinet member is always elsewhere on the night of the State of the
Union address.) Elaborate, classified plans for "continuity of
government" have already been drawn up in a number of countries, but the
potential for chaos and confusion---if almost all of a country's top
leaders were killed---would still be enormous. Who, for example, could
address the public on what the government would do, and what the public
should do, to respond? Could anyone honestly assure the public there
would be no further attacks? If they did, who would believe them? In the
United States, given the practical impossibility of passing major
legislation with Congress in ruins and most of its members dead or
seriously injured, some have argued for passing legislation in advance
giving the government emergency powers to act---and creating procedures,
for example, for legitimately replacing most of the House of
Representatives. But to date, no such legislative preparations have been
made. In what would inevitably be a desperate effort to prevent further
attacks, traditional standards of civil liberties might be jettisoned,
at least for a time---particularly when people realized that the fuel
for the bomb that had done such damage would easily have fit in a
suitcase. Old rules limiting search and surveillance could be among the
first to go. The government might well impose martial law as it sought
to control the situation, hunt for the perpetrators, and find any
additional weapons or nuclear materials they might have. Even the far
smaller attacks of 9/11 saw the US government authorizing torture of
prisoners and mass electronic surveillance. And what standards of
international order and law would still hold sway? **[[The country
attacked might]{.mark} well [lash out militarily]{.mark} at whatever
countries it thought might bear a portion of responsibility. (A
terrifying description of the kinds of discussions that might occur
appeared in Brian Jenkins' book, Will Terrorists Go Nuclear?) [With the
nuclear threshold already crossed]{.mark} in this scenario---at least by
terrorists---it is conceivable that some of the [resulting conflicts
might escalate to nuclear use]{.mark}. International politics could
become more brutish and violent, with powerful states taking unilateral
action, by force if necessary, in an effort to ensure their security.
After 9/11, the United States led the invasions of two sovereign
nations, in wars that have since cost hundreds of thousands of lives and
trillions of dollars, while plunging a region into chaos. Would the
reaction after a far more devastating nuclear attack be any
less?]{.underline}**

**[[The Benefits of]{.mark} Restoring [Diplomatic
Relations]{.mark}]{.underline}**

With the agreement fully restoring diplomatic functions, a new chapter
in **[[U.S.-Russia relations]{.underline}]{.mark}** has begun. This move
**[[carries]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[significant
benefits:]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Ending the Ukraine Conflict on Russian Terms: The Riyadh talks indicate
a shift toward a realistic resolution of the conflict in Ukraine. With
President Trump prioritizing diplomacy over prolonged military
engagement, the conflict is likely to conclude in a manner favorable to
Russia. This means Ukraine will not join NATO, and Russia's territorial
gains will be acknowledged.

Erosion of NATO's Influence: With the U.S. signaling a reduced
commitment to European security, NATO's role is set to diminish. This
shift aligns with Russia's long-standing objective of limiting Western
military presence near its borders.

Economic Revival: The resumption of diplomatic ties is expected to lead
to the lifting of sanctions, allowing Russia to reintegrate into global
trade networks. This will benefit energy markets, stabilize commodity
prices, and foster economic cooperation.

**[[Enhanced Strategic Cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}**: The
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[and Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** have common interests in
**[counterterrorism, space exploration, and [Arctic
development]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Renewed **[[diplomacy paves the way
for collaborative projects in these areas.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[[Negative Impacts of Severed Diplomatic Ties]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[[The deterioration of U.S.-Russia relations had severe
consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[affecting]{.mark} not just the
two nations but [the entire global community:]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Lack of Communication: With diplomatic missions largely inoperative,
direct dialogue between the two **[[nuclear
powers]{.underline}]{.mark}** was nearly impossible,
**[[increasing]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[[risk of miscalculations

Geopolitical Fragmentation: The hostility between the U.S. and Russia
deepened global divisions, particularly in Europe, where the conflict in
Ukraine **[[disrupt]{.underline}]{.mark}**ed **[[political and economic

Economic Consequences: Trade restrictions and sanctions significantly
affected global markets, particularly in energy and agriculture, leading
to **[[inflation and supply chain disruptions.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[[Military Escalation:]{.underline}]{.mark}** The absence of direct
negotiations fueled military confrontations in Ukraine, increasing the
human and financial costs.

#### US-Russia relations solve multiple scenarios for nuclear conflict --- prolif, North Korea, Iran 

**Pifer 12** --- Steven Pifer is director of the Brookings Arms Control
Initiative and a senior fellow with the Center for 21st Century Security

Accessed: 5/16/25)

Looking forward, **[[a positive relationship with Russia]{.mark} can
[advance U.S. interests]{.mark}, even if Washington and Moscow differ on
some issues]{.underline}** and if the United States is frustrated about
corruption and the democracy and human rights situation in Russia.
**[[Russian support remains critical to]{.mark} achieving key
[Washington policy goals]{.mark} such as [sustaining pressure on the
nuclear rogue states]{.mark} and [supporting coalition military
operations in Afghanistan]{.mark}]{.underline}**. There are a number of
issues on which Moscow can play a spoiler role if it believes the United
States is not paying due regard to Russian interests. Improving
U.S.-Russian relations further may prove more difficult than it has been
in the past three years, as the easier questions have been settled.
Nevertheless, Washington should seek to work with Russia on a number of
issues. First, **[Washington should engage Moscow on a further bilateral
round of [nuclear arms reductions]{.mark}]{.underline}**, this time
including strategic and non-strategic nuclear weapons, whether deployed
or non-deployed, under a common ceiling in a follow-on agreement to New
START. A sublimit on deployed strategic warheads could restrict those
nuclear weapons of greatest concern. While Moscow currently shows little
enthusiasm for further nuclear cuts, it may have incentives to deal.
**[Such an agreement would promote a more stable balance at lower levels
of nuclear weapons. It would respond to the concern expressed by the
Senate in its resolution of ratification for New START that
non-strategic nuclear weapons be addressed. And it could produce cost
savings, freeing up defense resources to fund operations that the U.S.
military is far more likely to engage in than nuclear
war]{.underline}**.

Second, Washington and NATO should continue to pursue a cooperative
missile defense arrangement with Russia. That prospect is currently
stalled by Moscow's demand for a legal guarantee that U.S. missile
defenses in Europe not be directed against Russian strategic missile
forces. While it is reasonable for the Russians to be concerned that
missile defenses could affect the offense-defense relationship, that is
a concern for the future. It is very difficult to see the U.S. plan for
missile defenses in Europe over the next decade posing any serious
threat to Russian strategic missiles. NATO should leave the door open
for cooperation and provide transparency about its missile defense
capabilities and plans. **[A cooperative missile defense arrangement
would be a significant achievement. It would remove one of the thornier
issues from the U.S.-Russia and NATO-Russia agendas; [provide for a
better defense of Europe]{.mark} than just a NATO system alone; and give
the Russian military greater transparency about U.S. and NATO missile
defense capabilities. Such transparency could help assure Moscow that
those missile defense capabilities pose no threat]{.underline}**. Such
cooperation, moreover, could prove a "game-changer" in attitudes by
making NATO and Russia genuine partners in defending Europe against
ballistic missile attack.

Third, **[Washington should seek to work closely with Russia in the Six
Party process on North Korea]{.underline}** and the UNSC Five-plus-One
talks with Iran. **[Russia]{.underline}** may have only marginal
**[[influence]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the Six Party talks, but **[it
has absolutely no interest in a [nuclear-armed North Korea]{.mark}. The
Russians have been helpful in the Six Party process in the
past]{.underline}**. Iran presents a more complex question. **[The
Russians do not want to see [Iran]{.mark} with nuclear
weapons]{.underline}**, but the level of urgency about this question in
Moscow is less than it is in Washington. For the United States, a
nuclear-armed Iran is a nightmare scenario. Russia, on the other hand,
has had a more normal relationship with Tehran over the past 35 years.
**[For the Russians, an Iran with nuclear weapons would be a very
negative development, to be sure, but they believe---correctly or
not---that they could cope with]{.underline}** it, much as the United
States has sought to deal since 1998 with an openly nuclear Pakistan**[.
Moscow probably will not go as far as Washington would like in further
pressuring the Iranian government, but that does not diminish the fact
that the Russians have come a long way in supporting mandatory UN
sanctions]{.underline}**. The West would not want to see Moscow ease up
on the measures it has adopted to date. Fourth, **[continued cooperation
on Afghanistan remains very much in the U.S. interest]{.underline}**.
The United States and NATO need Moscow's assistance for continued ease
in moving equipment and personnel to---and, as NATO begins to draw down,
from---Afghanistan. **[Even in the best of circumstances, Afghanistan is
likely to remain an unsettled and fragile state after 2014. The Russians
are concerned that [instability]{.mark} there could spill over
[in]{.mark}to [Central Asia]{.mark}. It would make sense for Washington
to intensify consultations with Moscow on steps that might be taken to
[bolster the stability of the Central Asian
states]{.mark}]{.underline}** that border Afghanistan.

**[There are areas where [cooperation is necessary]{.mark}. The most
obvious is the [revival and strengthening of nuclear missile
treaties]{.mark}. [The U.S. and Russia]{.mark} still [hold the most
nuclear weapons]{.mark} in the world, [and working to reduce the
amount]{.mark} and ways they are deployed [would help temper fears
of]{.mark} [m]{.mark}utually [a]{.mark}ssured [d]{.mark}estruction [and
set a positive precedent]{.mark} for other agreements with nuclear-armed
countries such as China. [Other issues]{.mark}, [such as
the Arctic and cyber security]{.mark}, in which both the U.S. and Russia
are decisive players, [could be]{.mark} future [issues both
countries]{.mark} bilaterally [resolve]{.mark}.  ]{.underline}**

**[[Rapprochement is in the long-term interests of both
countries]{.mark}. For Russia, its demographic crisis will be
exacerbated by the war as more of its young men come home in coffins.
With fewer young men comes fewer workers, leading to economic stagnation
and recession, worsened by global sanctions. Rapprochement [could mean
the difference between further stagnation and sustainable]{.mark}
demographic and economic [growth]{.mark}.  For the U.S., rapprochement
with Russia can help ease demand on a country with limited military and
diplomatic resources. [It can allow the U.S. to finally accomplish its
pivot towards Asia,]{.mark} a wishful goal since the early 2010s. And
rapprochement [may prevent a formal Sino-Russian alliance]{.mark},
[which would both be a geopolitical disaster]{.mark} for the U.S. [and
push the world towards a third global
catastrophe.]{.mark}  ]{.underline}**

[**[If U.S.-Russian relations]{.mark} continue to [deteriorate]{.mark},
[the risk of nuclear war will increase]{.mark}**.]{.underline} While
rapprochement will not happen until the war in Ukraine concludes, it is
both countries' moral duty to get there eventually[. **Both sides can
choose not to be enemies**.]{.underline} They can cooperate when their
interests are aligned and effectively communicate when opposed. But
until that happens, midnight inches ever closer.

Rhetorical Restraint The United States and Russia could reiterate the
1985 Ronald Reagan-- Mikhail Gorbachev statement that "a nuclear war
cannot be won and must never be fought," which was last renewed in a
January 3, 2022, P5 Process statement.50 In this scenario, [**[the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and Russia could focus on
avoiding]{.mark} rhetoric or declaratory [policy that would further
destabilize the bilateral relationship]{.mark} without any particular
benefit**.]{.underline} Specifically, they could avoid the following in
their public statements and declarations: • Advancing strategic defeat
narratives, including any statements that imply that an end to conflict
or hostilities necessitates the total military and economic destruction
of the other side, no matter the cost. • Implying, even if indirectly,
the need to undermine the other's nuclear arsenal or NC3. • Engaging in
"loose" nuclear talk (i.e., saber-rattling statements that allude to the
use of nuclear weapons or destabilizing activities related to the
testing, deployment, or alert status of nuclear weapons), particularly
by senior officials. • Linking the timing of nuclear delivery systems
testing and strategic forces exercises to unrelated events. For example,
in May 2024, Moscow cited "military statements" by Western officials as
justification for an exercise simulating the use of NSNW.51 • Broadening
circumstances and conditions for nuclear use in declaratory policy and
in comments by relevant officials. Dialogue and Crisis Communications
The United States and Russia could uphold president-to-president;
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff--to--chairman of the general
staff; and intelligence community leadership hotlines to ensure that
crises do not spiral out of control. They could also preserve the
National Nuclear Risk Reduction Centers in Washington and Moscow as a
tool for both crisis communications and signaling purposes.52 Russia and
the United States could also seek to maintain existing bilateral
mechanisms to address possible incidents (e.g., INCSEA) that could lead
to escalation, as described in the base case. Finally, Washington and
Moscow could designate third countries to serve as trusted
intermediaries to help avoid misperceptions and maintain channels of
communication. Doctrinal Transparency The United States and Russia could
commit to maintaining a human in the loop for nuclear decisionmaking. In
addition, the two countries could continue to uphold some level of
transparency through published doctrinal documents (e.g., the U.S.
Nuclear Posture Review and Foundations of State Policy of the Russian
Federation in the Field of Nuclear Deterrence).53 European Security At
the NATO-Russia level, both the alliance and Moscow could release
unilateral statements of restraint emphasizing their strictly defensive
intentions. For example, such a statement could read: "NATO is not at
war with Russia. We do not seek confrontation with Russia." Although
such statements are unlikely to affect threat perceptions, they would
impose message discipline and thus avoid loose talk of conflict or war
that could fuel tensions. Multilateral Engagement The United States and
Russia could avoid permanently undermining or destroying multilateral
regimes that could be revived under different political circumstances.
In other words, conflict between the two at such institutions as IAEA is
inevitable in this scenario, and the institutions themselves are likely
to function poorly as a result. But rather than withdrawing from these
institutions or taking deliberate steps to undermine them (such as
withholding funding), both sides should stay engaged and keep the
regimes in place for a future moment when cooperation becomes possible.
Summary [**This [worst-case scenario represents a significant
deterioration of the security environment]{.mark}. As the remaining
bilateral and multilateral arms control regimes begin to collapse,
strategic and behavioral restraint will be necessary to manage
escalation and prevent further destabilization of the bilateral
relationship. This [worst-case scenario]{.mark}, summarized in Table 2,
[holds significant potential to devolve into the actual worst-case
scenario---a nuclear exchange]{.mark}---if urgent measures are not taken
to reduce misperceptions and create guardrails. Despite the tensions
present in this scenario, there are several opportunities for
strengthening stability**.]{.underline} For the United States and
Russia, revisiting past commitments on nuclear testing, past statements
on the impermissibility of nuclear war, and crisis communications
methods likely will not require further negotiation, and measures of
strategic and behavioral restraint are inherently unilateral, even if
reciprocated. In this fraught and unpredictable environment, arms
control would be largely unilateral. More-ambitious efforts toward
sustained dialogue and formal agreements will result from either a
crisis or a gradual strengthening of bilateral stability. The options
presented here are intended to advance the latter.

**[While nuclear weapons exist, there remains a danger that they will be
used. After all, for centuries international conflicts have led to wars,
with nations employing their deadliest weapons. The current
deterioration of U.S. relations with China might end up providing us
with yet another example of this phenomenon]{.underline}**. The
[[**gathering tension**]{.mark} between the United States and China
**[is clear enough]{.mark}**. **Disturbed by China\'s growing economic
and military strength, the U.S. government recently challenged China\'s
claims in the South China Sea,**]{.underline} increased the U.S.
military presence in Australia, and deepened U.S. military ties with
other nations in the Pacific region. According to Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton, the United States was \"asserting our own position as a
Pacific power.\" But [**[need this lead to nuclear war?]{.mark}** Not
necessarily. And yet, **[there are signs that it could.]{.mark}** After
all, both the United States and China possess large numbers of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. The U.S. government threatened to attack China
with nuclear weapons during the Korean War and, later, during their
conflict over the future of China\'s offshore islands, Quemoy and Matsu.
In the midst of the latter confrontation, President Dwight Eisenhower
declared publicly, and chillingly, that U.S. nuclear weapons would \"be
used just exactly as you would use a bullet or anything else.\" Of
course, [China didn\'t have nuclear weapons then. Now that it does,
perhaps the behavior of national leaders will be more temperate. But the
loose nuclear threats of U.S. and Soviet government officials during the
Cold War, when both nations had vast nuclear arsenals, should convince
us that, even as the military ante is raised, nuclear saber-rattling
persists. Some pundits argue that nuclear weapons prevent wars between
nuclear-armed nations]{.underline}; and, admittedly, there haven\'t been
very many \-- at least not yet. [But the [**Kargil**]{.mark} War of
1999, between nuclear-armed India and nuclear-armed Pakistan, **[should
convince us that such wars can
occur]{.mark}**]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}** Indeed, in that case, the
conflict almost slipped into a nuclear war. Pakistan\'s foreign
secretary threatened that, if the war escalated, his country felt free
to use \"any weapon\" in its arsenal. [During the conflict, Pakistan did
move nuclear weapons toward its border, while India, it is claimed,
readied its own nuclear missiles for an attack on Pakistan]{.underline}.
At the least, though, don\'t nuclear weapons deter a nuclear attack? Do
they? Obviously, [NATO leaders didn\'t feel deterred, for, throughout
the Cold War, NATO\'s strategy was to respond to a Soviet conventional
military attack on Western Europe by launching a Western nuclear attack
on the nuclear-armed Soviet Union]{.underline}. Furthermore, if U.S.
government officials really believed that nuclear deterrence worked,
they would not have resorted to championing \"Star Wars\" and its modern
variant, national missile defense. Why are these vastly expensive \--
and probably unworkable \-- military defense systems needed if other
nuclear powers are deterred from attacking by U.S. nuclear might? Of
course, the bottom line for those Americans convinced that nuclear
weapons safeguard them from a Chinese nuclear attack might be that the
U.S. nuclear arsenal is far greater than its Chinese counterpart. Today,
[it is estimated that the U.S. government possesses over 5,000 nuclear
warheads, while the Chinese government has a total inventory of roughly
300 .]{.underline} Moreover, only about 40 of these Chinese nuclear
weapons can reach the United States. [[**Surely the** **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [**would \"win\" any**]{.mark} nuclear
**[war]{.mark}** with China. But what would [**that
\"victory\"**]{.mark} entail? An attack with these Chinese nuclear
weapons **[would]{.mark}** immediately [**slaughter** **at least 10
million Americans**]{.mark} in a great storm of blast and fire, while
leaving many more dying horribly of sickness and radiation poisoning.
[**The Chinese death toll**]{.mark} in a nuclear war **[would be far
higher]{.mark}**. [**Both nations** **would be reduced to**]{.mark}
smoldering, radioactive **[wastelands]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Also,
[[**radioactive debris**]{.mark} sent aloft by the nuclear explosions
**[would blot out the sun and]{.mark}** [**bring on a** **\"nuclear
winter**\"]{.mark} around the globe \-- **[destroying
ag]{.mark}**riculture, **[creating]{.mark}** worldwide
**[famine]{.mark}**, and generating **[chaos and
destruction]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Moreover, in another decade the
extent of this catastrophe would be far worse. The Chinese government is
currently expanding its nuclear arsenal, and by the year 2020 it is
expected to more than double its number of nuclear weapons that can hit
the United States. The U.S. government, in turn, has plans to spend
hundreds of billions of dollars \"modernizing\" its nuclear weapons and
nuclear production facilities over the next decade.

Following the commitment by Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev
at the June 24th [[**U.S.-Russia Summit to** **promote energy efficiency
and green tech**]{.mark}**nology**,]{.underline} the U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID) and the Russian Energy Agency (REA) on
July 21 signed a Protocol of Intent to **[[deepen

grid\" technology, and clean energy. The agreement will foster
**[[partnerships with U.S. and Russia]{.mark}n utilities, regulators and
others to [share info]{.mark}rmation [and best
practices]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Potential activities will reduce
energy loss in electricity systems and decrease levels of carbon
emissions to help mitigate climate change. The signing occurred as a
part of a larger program of the U.S.-Russia Bilateral Presidential
Commission Energy Working Group under the leadership of U.S. Secretary
of Energy Steven Chu and Russian Minister of Energy Sergey Shmatko.
**[[The U.S. and Russia are among the world\'s largest emitters of
g]{.mark}reen[h]{.mark}ouse [g]{.mark}asses per capita]{.underline}**
according to the World Bank. Both also have enormous potential for
energy efficiency improvements. A report by the World Bank Group
estimated that realizing its full energy efficiency potential could save
Russia up to \$80 billion annually. During the signing ceremony, USAID
Deputy Assistant Administrator for Europe & Eurasia Jonathan Hale noted,
[\"**[We both have a lot to gain from new

is just one of USAID\'s efforts to improve energy efficiency, energy
security, and clean energy technology in Europe and Eurasia and

**[[Climate change]{.mark} intersects with pre-existing national
security risks to [function as a threat multiplier]{.mark} and
[accelerant to instability]{.mark}, contributing to [escalating cycles
of]{.mark} humanitarian and socio-political crises, [conflict]{.mark}
and forced migration.]{.underline}**

**[Climate-change impacts on food and water systems, declining crop

failures have already become [catalys]{.mark}ts for social
[breakdown]{.mark} [and conflict]{.mark} across the Middle East, the
Maghreb and the Sahel, contributing to the European migration
crisis.]{.underline}**

Understanding and foreseeing such events depends crucially on an
appreciation of the real strengths and limitations of climate-science
projections, and the application of risk-management frameworks which
differ fundamentally from conventional practice.

SCIENTIFIC RETICENCE

**[Climate [scientists]{.mark} may err on the side of "least drama",
whose causes may include adherence to the scientific norms of restraint,
objectivity and skepticism, and may underpredict or [down-play]{.mark}
future climate [changes]{.mark}. In 2007, security analysts warned that,
in the two previous decades, scientific [predictions]{.mark} in the
climate-change arena had consistently [under-estimated the
severity]{.mark} of what actually transpired. 3]{.underline}**

[This problem persists, notably in the work of]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(**[IPCC]{.underline}**), whose Assessment Reports exhibit a one-sided
reliance on general climate models, which incorporate important climate
processes, but [do **not** include all of the processes that can
contribute to **system feedbacks**, **compound extreme events**, and
**abrupt and/or irreversible changes**]{.underline}. 4

Other forms of knowledge are downplayed, including paleoclimatology,
expert advice, and semi-empirical models. IPCC reports present detailed,
quantified, complex modelling results, but then briefly note more
severe, non- linear, system-change possibilities in a descriptive,
non-quantified form. Because policymakers and the media are often drawn
to headline numbers, this approach results in less attention being given
to the most devastating, difficult-to-quantify outcomes.

In one example, the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report in 2014 projected a
sea-level rise of 0.55-0.82 metre by 2100, but said "levels above the
likely range cannot be reliably evaluated". By way of comparison, the
higher of two US Department of Defence scenarios is a two-metre rise by
2100, and the "extreme" scenario developed by a number of US government
agencies is 2.5 metres by 2100. 5

Another example is the recent IPCC 1.5°C report, which projected that
warming would continue at the current rate of 0.2°C per decade and reach
the 1.5°C mark around 2040. **[However the 1.5°C [boundary]{.mark} is
likely to be [passed in]{.mark} half that time, around [2030]{.mark},
and the 2°C boundary around 2045, due to accelerating anthropogenic
emissions]{.underline}**, decreased aerosol loading and changing ocean

EXISTENTIAL RISK

An existential risk to civilisation is one posing permanent large
negative consequences to humanity which may never be undone, either
annihilating intelligent life or permanently and drastically curtailing
its potential.

**[With the commitments by nations to the 2015 Paris Agreement, the
current path of warming is 3°C or more by 2100. But this figure does not
include "long-term" carbon-cycle [feedbacks]{.mark}, which are
materially relevant now]{.underline}** and in the near future due to the
unprecedented rate at which human activity is perturbing the climate
system. Taking these into account, the Paris path would lead to around
5°C of warming by 2100. 7

**[Scientists warn that warming of 4°C is incompatible with an organised
global community, is [devastating]{.mark} to the majority of
[ecosystems]{.mark}, and has a high probability of not being stable. The
World Bank says it may be "[beyond adaptation]{.mark}". But an
existential threat may also exist for many peoples and regions at a
significantly lower level of warming]{.underline}**. In 2017, 3°C of
warming was categorised as "catastrophic" with a warning that, on a path
of unchecked emissions, low-probability, high-impact warming could be
catastrophic by 2050. 9

The Emeritus Director of the Potsdam Institute, Prof. Hans Joachim
Schellnhuber, warns that "climate change is now reaching the end-game,
where very soon humanity must choose between taking unprecedented
action, or accepting that it has been left too late and bear the
consequences." He says that if we continue down the present path "there
is a very big risk that we will just end our civilisation. The human
species will survive somehow but we will destroy almost everything we
have built up over the last two thousand years." 11

Unfortunately, conventional risk and probability analysis becomes
useless in these circumstances because it excludes the full implications
of outlier events and possibilities lurking at the fringes.12

Prudent risk-management means a tough, objective look at the real risks
to which we are exposed, especially at those "fat-tail" events, which
may have consequences that are damaging beyond quantification, and
threaten the survival of human civilisation.

**[Global warming projections display a "fat-tailed" distribution with a
[greater likelihood]{.mark} of warming that is well in excess of the
average amount of warming [predicted by]{.mark} climate [models]{.mark},
and are of a higher probability than would be expected under typical
statistical assumptions.]{.underline}** More importantly, the risk lies
disproportionately in the "fat-tail" outcomes, as illustrated in Figure
1.

Impacts produce (c) Risk. Lower likelihood events at the high end of the
probability distribution have the highest risk (Credit: RT Sutton/E
Hawkins).

**[This is a particular concern with potential climate
[tipping-points]{.mark} --- passing critical thresholds which result in
step changes in the climate system that will be irreversible on human
timescales --- such as the polar ice sheets (and hence sea levels),
permafrost and other carbon stores, where the impacts of global warming
[are non-linear]{.mark} and difficult to model with current scientific
knowledge.]{.underline}**

**[Recently, attention has been given to a "hothouse Earth" scenario, in
which system feedbacks and their mutual interaction could drive the
Earth System climate to a [point of no return]{.mark}, whereby further
warming would become self-sustaining. This "hothouse Earth" planetary
threshold could [exist at a temp]{.mark}erature rise [as low as
2°]{.mark}C, possibly [even lower]{.mark}.]{.underline}**13

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin **[Netanyahu has made little secret of
his desire to address Iran's developing capacity with military
force]{.underline}**. Such **[posturing makes it plain that [nuclear
weapons]{.mark} are [a]{.mark} present [danger]{.mark} and could wreak
havoc [in]{.mark} a regional [escalation]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

The **[threat of [nuclear weapons is resurging]{.mark} in a manner not
seen since the height of the Cold War]{.underline}**. Since February
2022, **[Russian [officials]{.mark} and pundits have [made]{.mark} a
number of [threats]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- some insinuated, some overt
-- to use nuclear weapons, presumably against Ukraine, a non-nuclear
weapons state. Russia has pre-positioned nuclear weapons in Belarus.

Yonhapnews TV shows a file image of North Korea\'s missile launch during
a news programme on a TV at Yongsan Railroad Station in Seoul.

**[[Interest in]{.mark} [nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark} and their
hoped-for deterrent effect has subsequently [grown in non-nuclear
countries]{.mark}]{.underline}** such as South Korea, Germany and
Poland.

The latter is considering joining the European countries that host US
nuclear weapons (Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey).

North Korea continues to develop untrammelled its nuclear weapons
programme while India and Pakistan remain in a state of a bilateral
nuclear belligerence.

The five nuclear weapons states are all modernizing their nuclear
weapons. Numbers though remain far lower than in the Cold War (the US
and Russia for example have an estimated 5,044 and 5,580 warheads,
respectively, down from cold war heights of around 31,000 and 40,000).

China is not only modernizing its nuclear forces but also expanding
their reach and numbers of delivery systems -- albeit from a far lower
level (some 500 warheads).

**[Other Middle East countries attempted the nuclear weapons
route]{.underline}**. Iraq in the 1980s and 1990s got very close but was
thwarted by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors after
the invasion of Kuwait.

Syria's secret reactor was bombed before it was loaded with nuclear
fuel, and much of Libya's imports from AQ Khan (the lead scientist in
Pakistan's nuclear weapons programme) was left unpacked.

Sending a nuclear signal

**[[Things]{.mark} are different and [more
dangerous]{.mark}]{.underline}** now. **[[Tensions]{.mark} remain
[high]{.mark}. A cycle of attack and counter-attack between Israel and
Iran in April has ended -- for now]{.underline}** -- with Israel's
prompt and pointed strike in the vicinity of the Isfahan nuclear
facility in Iran. The **[choice of target was a clear signal to Iran
that [Israel]{.mark} could, in the future, [stealthily attack
Iran]{.mark}ian nuclear sites]{.underline}** should it so choose.

Iran's choices, long debated by its officials, remain as they have been
for years: a) to continue as a nuclear threshold state with the
capability to develop nuclear weapons but choosing not to cross that
threshold, at least for now; or b) to cross the nuclear threshold and
declare their status, either via a nuclear weapons test explosion or by
declaration.

So far, Iran has stayed under the critical nuclear threshold, despite
getting very close prior to 2003.

So far, Iran has stayed under the critical nuclear threshold, despite
getting very close prior to 2003. Since the US quit the Iran nuclear
deal (the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) in 2018, Iran has declared
that it is no longer bound by those obligations. It has also recently
also withdrew the designation of several experienced IAEA inspectors,
although as yet cooperates and allows routine inspections.

**[The Israeli]{.underline}**--Iranian **[attack]{.underline}** and
counter **[[attacks]{.mark} are likely to [strengthen]{.mark} arguments
in [Iran]{.mark} for [acquiring nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Yet doing so poses greater risks for Iran in terms of a pre-emptive
Israeli attack, and would undermine the fragile progress made in its
relationships with neighbours.

Weighing up nuclear options

Indeed, **[[Saudi Arabia]{.mark} is [moving ahead]{.mark} with a nuclear
energy programme]{.underline}**. Many fear this is cover for starting a
nuclear weapons programme, which Saudi leaders occasionally threaten.
Given US reticence about supporting nuclear efforts, **[Saudi Arabia may
be tilting towards less complicated assistance from
China]{.underline}**.

How likely is the use of nuclear weapons by Russia?

Other states such as **[[Egypt]{.mark} have -- or may [decide to
acquire]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- **[the technical capability to develop
nuclear weapons]{.underline}** but none seems to be at a stage where
that is an immediate option.

Further afield, interest in reconsidering nuclear options is growing.
**[[India and Pakistan remain in]{.mark} a nuclear
[stand-off]{.mark}]{.underline}**, with several instances of high alert.

South Korea and Japan are under constant threat from North Korea, while
Taiwan is ever fearful of China's claims to its territory. Each country
has the technical capacity to develop a national nuclear weapons
programme. South Korea reported 20 years ago that it had conducted laser
isotope separation experiments with uranium and plutonium in
contravention of its IAEA commitments -- it has since worked with the
IAEA to ensure full compliance.

Japan maintains a strong commitment to global nuclear disarmament,
having been the only country to have suffered nuclear weapons attacks in
war. The US does, however, extend its military capabilities in defence
of Japan, Taiwan and South Korea, and these include US nuclear weapons
systems.

Underscoring all these developments is how nuclear weapons are perceived
in military doctrines and postures in the US, Russia and increasingly in
China. **[[Rising fear]{.mark} of major regional and global violent
conflict [suggests]{.mark} that [faith]{.mark} in the concept of nuclear
deterrence is eroding]{.underline}**.

**[[carries]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[significant
benefits:]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Ending the Ukraine Conflict on Russian Terms: The Riyadh talks indicate
a shift toward a realistic resolution of the conflict in Ukraine. With
President Trump prioritizing diplomacy over prolonged military
engagement, the conflict is likely to conclude in a manner favorable to
Russia. This means Ukraine will not join NATO, and Russia's territorial
gains will be acknowledged.

Erosion of NATO's Influence: With the U.S. signaling a reduced
commitment to European security, NATO's role is set to diminish. This
shift aligns with Russia's long-standing objective of limiting Western
military presence near its borders.

Economic Revival: The resumption of diplomatic ties is expected to lead
to the lifting of sanctions, allowing Russia to reintegrate into global
trade networks. This will benefit energy markets, stabilize commodity
prices, and foster economic cooperation.

**[[Enhanced Strategic Cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}**: **[The
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}** **[[and
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** have common interests in
**[counterterrorism, [space exploration,]{.mark} and Arctic

**[It's no secret]{.underline}**: **[Things are getting
complicated]{.underline}** **[in space]{.underline}**. Late last year,
the upper stage of a rocket that first overshot the Moon in 1966 whizzed
its way back to Earth's orbit, adding to the nearly 8,000 metric tons of
space debris -- over half a million individual pieces -- circling the
planet.Footnote1 **[Over the last 12 years]{.underline}**, **[the United
States, Russia, China, and India have each tested anti-satellite
weapons]{.underline}** capable of destroying the space-based
infrastructure that forms the warp and woof of our modern economy. Add
to this the **[inauguration of the US Space Force,]{.underline}** which
recently deployed its first troops abroad in QatarFootnote2; the
**[privatization of space]{.underline}** typified by companies like
SpaceX, Virgin Galactic, and Blue OriginFootnote3; and the **[return of
moon rocks to Earth by China's Chang'e-5 probe]{.underline}**, which
promises to **[spark a renewed international debate about space
resources]{.underline}**.Footnote4 One needn't be a headline gobbler to
notice that the pace of change in space is reaching (pun intended)
cosmic proportions.

In **[[no area of space politics]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[is]{.mark}
this [complexity]{.mark} [more dangerous than]{.mark} in [US-Russia
relations]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which, **[particularly since Russia's
annexation of Crimea]{.underline}**, have cooled to the point that
**[some pundits are talking]{.underline}** **[of a new Cold
War]{.underline}** and indeed a second space race. Consider events just
over the last year. In May 2020, **[NASA launched two
astronauts]{.underline}** **[to the international space
station]{.underline}** using domestic technology for the first time
since the end of the Space Shuttle era, **[severing a nine-year
dependence on Russian lift vehicles]{.underline}**.Footnote5 At the same
time, the agency announced the "Artemis Accords," an international
agreement intended to establish basic ground rules for space activities;
Russia, suspicious of American commercial interests on the Moon and
conceiving of the entire lunar program as "too US-centric," declined to
participate.Footnote6 And in February, April, and December, Russia
tested direct-ascent and co-orbital anti-satellite weapons. The tests
were only the latest manifestation of increased military activity in
space, which the Pentagon considers "a war-fighting domain."Footnote7

**[There's]{.underline}** **[[no time like this]{.mark} precarious
present [to reignite US-Russian cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}** in
space. **[[Besides]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[obvious [opportunities
for change]{.mark}]{.underline}** that a new administration in
Washington has opened up,Footnote8 **[collaboration on shared technical
challenges]{.underline}** **[in [space]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[provide]{.underline}**]{.mark} the **[two [countries]{.mark} [with a
fresh avenue to ease]{.mark} the political and military
[tensions]{.mark}]{.underline}** that have marred their bi-lateral
relationship for years.

**[Chief]{.underline}** **[among these challenges is the application of
nuclear technologies]{.underline}** **[to space
exploration]{.underline}**, an area in which the United States and
Russia face serious obstacles, despite claims of world leadership. Along
with the risk of nuclear proliferation, complications with fuel
efficiency, and the high energy requirements of exploiting
extraterrestrial resources, space nuclear technology presents a host of
technical challenges that neither American nor Russian engineering can
easily solve on its own. But **[bilateral [cooperation in
space]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- **[US and Russian technical
experience,]{.underline}** as it turns out, **[[is quite
complementary]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- **[can open the door to the next
generation of manned crewed missions into the cosmos]{.underline}**.
That **[[same door]{.mark} might just [close the arms race in
space]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Nuclear thermal propulsion

While chemistry has propelled humanity to the moon, interplanetary
exploration will likely require the use of denser energy sources. Of the
nuclear approaches to space propulsion, nuclear thermal propulsion, or
NTP, is uniquely suited to the rigors of crewed space exploration beyond
low earth orbit.Footnote9 The combination of high specific impulse (a
form of fuel mass efficiency) and high thrust is unattainable with any
competing technology.

**[Nuclear thermal propulsion has been under development for more than
sixty-five]{.underline}** **[years]{.underline}**. **[Both the United
States and Russia pursued NTP systems]{.underline}**, though via
dramatically different technological pathways. US efforts began shortly
after the end of the Second World War and peaked during project Rover
(1955--73).Footnote10 The engines developed in this era relied on slow
neutrons to sustain their chain reactions (so-called thermal spectrum
reactors) and used highly enriched uranium as fuel and technologies well
understood at the time, such as graphite moderators to slow neutrons.
While successful in proving the viability of the nuclear thermal
propulsion concept, they suffered from fission product losses during
operation, and rapid erosion of graphite fuel elements, problems that
were not fully solved by the end of the program.Footnote11

Soviet scientists working on the NTP problem beginning in the 1970s
learned from the setbacks of the American program. They developed
fast-spectrum reactors using uranium carbide-based fuels that could
sustain very high temperatures as required for space reactors. The
resulting research and development effort was more limited in scope but
resulted in dramatically improved retention of fission products and
unprecedented specific impulse in the RD-0410 engine.Footnote12 By the
mid-1980s, hot-fire tests of the Soviet system had definitively proved
that the fuel erosion issues uncovered in the US program could be
overcome.

Collectively, **[the lessons learned from both programs suggest advanced
ceramic fuels]{.underline}** (primarily "ternary carbides" and
ceramic-metallic fuels)Footnote13 **[offer convincing means of creating
durable nuclear thermal propulsion]{.underline}** systems. Future
development of these systems for crewed spaceflight will require
extensive, rigorous testing of these materials under realistic
conditions of temperature, pressure, and neutron irradiation. However,
in this challenge there exist the seeds of cooperation.

Today, **[[pooling]{.mark} testing [resources]{.mark} could
[significantly lower the technical barriers]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[to
t]{.underline}**he **[development of nuclear propulsion]{.underline}**
for crewed space exploration. In particular, Russia operates a number of
high-temperature, high-neutron-flux test reactors offering fuel testing
in extreme environments. These reactors are billion-dollar scale
investments that cannot be replicated with existing American facilities
without massive investment. Further, **[[Russia's successful]{.mark}
[fabrication of carbide fuels]{.mark}]{.underline}** for various reactor
experiments at **[scale points to a robust production capability not yet
realized in the United States]{.underline}**. As a partner, **[the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has the bulk of NTP]{.mark} [operating
experience]{.mark}]{.underline}**, extensive capacity to build
heavy-lift space vehicles, **[as well as potential hot-fire test
facilities that Russia lacks.]{.underline}**

Exploiting space resources

Opportunities for cooperation do not end with propulsion.
**[[Any]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[conceivable [trip]{.mark}
[beyond]{.mark} the [Earth-Moon]{.mark} system]{.underline}** -- to
Mars, for example -- **[[requires significant]{.mark} use of
[resources]{.mark} at the]{.underline}** destination, a process referred
to as "in situ resource utilization[,"]{.mark} or ISRU. Resources likely
to be extracted in near-term Mars missions include propellant, oxygen,
and building materials. Given the extreme energy demands of these
processes, they are best driven using nuclear reactors as a power
source.Footnote14

While **[ISRU research is ongoing in both countries]{.underline}**,
**[there exists a significant benefit to technical
cooperation]{.underline}** **[that]{.underline}**
**[could]{.underline}** smooth and **[shorten the path to long-term
off-world habitation]{.underline}**. In particular, there may be **[a
means to use Russia's history of space reactor
development]{.underline}** to accelerate the development of power
sources for resource exploitation in a joint mission. Space reactors
must operate under extreme constraints of reliability, in frigid
temperatures, and with no possibility of maintenance. The systems
engineering and material science challenges are, to say the least,
formidable. Yet **[Russia has extensive space reactor
experience]{.underline}** through a variety of molten sodium-potassium
cooled systems launched in the 1970s and 1980sFootnote15 for satellite
power. These reactors operated in the rigors of space and generally
performed well, providing a rich resource of technical documents and
institutional knowledge which could be leveraged by a joint program to
develop the power-generating side of an in situ resource utilization
system.

The **[United States has developed several resource-use experiments and
extensive research programs at universities]{.underline}** and NASA
research and development centers. The federal government has invested
heavily in the development of such systems for life support, such as the
Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment, or MOXIE, which is
currently converting several grams of the Martian atmosphere to small
quantities of water. The United States also leads the world in robotics
and has ongoing research programs to develop systems to excavate and
process regolith, the unconsolidated surface soil on planetary bodies.
All of these systems require robust, reliable power, and stand to
benefit from a joint US-Russian program to develop a surface reactor.
The **[[compressed timeline]{.mark} offered [by leveraging
Russia's]{.mark} space reactor [experience]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
test facilities **[could [help]{.mark} [develop]{.mark} these
[tech]{.mark}nologies to the maturity needed for a crewed
mission]{.underline}** many **[[years faster]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[than]{.underline}** either side could hope to achieve
**[alone]{.underline}**.

**[Proliferation risks]{.underline}**

Applying **[[nuclear tech]{.mark}nologies [in space]{.mark} [comes with
prolif]{.mark}eration [risks]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The most pressing
has to do with the use of highly enriched uranium (HEU) to fuel nuclear
reactors for space applications.Footnote16 HEU packs more uranium-235,
the isotope used to extract energy through fission, per kilogram of fuel
compared to low enriched uranium (LEU), allowing for lighter, more
compact reactors. Given the enormous cost for every kilogram sent into
space, many argue that using smaller HEU reactors would present
indisputable economic advantages over LEU reactors. The problem,
however, is that **[[HEU can]{.mark} readily [be used to make nuclear
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For instance, one prototype of the 1-kWe
kilo-power reactor developed in the United States would contain about 32
kilograms of HEU,Footnote17 more than enough to make a nuclear
bomb.Footnote18

For this reason, the **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** administration
**[[prohibited the use]{.mark} of HEU]{.underline}** except for
"applications for which the mission would not be viable with other
nuclear fuels or non-nuclear power sources."Footnote19

[**[But]{.underline}** **[efforts]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[to set an
example in nonproliferation]{.underline}** and nuclear security
practices **[for space [will fail]{.mark} [if]{.mark} other major space
actors like [Russia shirk]{.mark} the same
[restrictions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In such a scenario, any state with
covert nuclear ambitions could leverage a nascent space program to
obtain HEU, and countries with established space programs could be
tempted by the nuclear route. To **[effectively establish
nonproliferation standards for space]{.underline}**, the
**[[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and Russia]{.mark} must
[cooperate]{.mark} and agree [on common norms]{.mark} and
practices]{.underline}** for the use of nuclear technologies in space,
including a ban on the use of HEU. This **[[endeavor]{.mark} could [find
inspiration from]{.mark} [successful]{.mark} [prior
collaboration]{.mark}]{.underline}** between the US and Russia on
converting research reactors from HEU fuel to LEU fuel.Footnote20

**[US-Russia scientific collaboration can also make LEU reactors for
space more economically competitive]{.underline}**. The principal
disadvantage of LEU reactors -- a larger volume and weight compared to
those using HEU fuel -- can be mitigated by using thermal (slow)
neutrons. One issue with thermal reactors is that they require more
efficient use of available neutrons. Unfortunately, many of the most
promising reactor fuel designs for space applications (binary and
ternary carbides) are made with metals such as tungsten or hafnium that
absorb a lot of neutrons and cannot be used as such for thermal
reactors. One way to make them suitable for thermal reactors is to
remove the isotopes that absorb the most neutrons (also known as
enriching). With more than [4]{.mark}0 percent of worldwide
capacityFootnote21 for enrichment of stable isotopes using the most
advanced technology, Russia offers unparalleled capabilities for
enriching these metals.

Retaining knowledge

One final point. As we look to the future**[, we also cannot forget our
shared histories]{.underline}**. Much of the research and technical
prowess achieved in nuclear technologies for space in both countries are
shrouded in secrecy. Many technical reports and documents remain hidden
away or hard to access, and time is running out to capture the oral
histories of the scientists, engineers, and technicians that developed
space nuclear technology.

In the early 1990s, the **[two countries embarked on their most
significant space nuclear collaboration to date]{.underline}**, the
TOPAZ International Program. The **[United States purchased six
Soviet-designed TOPAZ-II reactors and employed dozens of Russian
scientists]{.underline}** in a joint testing program based at the
University of New Mexico.Footnote22 TOPAZ International illustrated the
potential of joint technology testing and development, but also the
complexity of bureaucratic challenges, export controls, and political
hurdles that eventually led to the cancellation of the project before a
single prototype launched. Russian academician Nikolay Nikolaevich
Ponomarev-Stepnoy, a key figure in the project,Footnote23 recently noted
that the history of the collaboration was being lost, with little effort
to capture memories and lessons learned: "Unfortunately, history is
being forgotten. It stays in some minds, but these are only a few minds,
and things just get forgotten."Footnote24 Future cooperation between
Russia and the United States must also include a joint effort to record
the knowledge and history of previous developments and the experiences
of individual experts, before their stories are lost to time.

**[[Space runs deep in US-Russian history]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For so
long, it has been a story about competition, mistrust, and politics.
Glancing at recent events, it appears little has changed. But
**[[technical cooperation]{.mark} in applying nuclear
power]{.underline}** **[in space]{.underline}** gives the two countries
**[[an opportunity to flip the script]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It **[[can

[Humanity might not get a second chance at survival.]{.underline} The
idea of an extinction event has long been fuel for science fiction
writers, and is exemplified in the novel by Neal Stephenson entitled
Seveneves.[^3^](https://www.potomacinstitute.org/steps/index.php/component/content/article/global-extinction-or-a-space-industrial-complex?catid=30&Itemid=101#notes) In
Seveneves, humanity will be wiped out on Earth within two years unless
nations collaborate to put a small group of astronauts and scientists on
the International Space Station in hopes they survive and repopulate the
planet. Science fiction has been known to become science fact, both in
ways that are beneficial to society, and in ways that have negative
consequences. A study of threats and a dystopian future is also
inculcated into academia, with Niklas Bostrom, the founder of the
"Future of Humanity Institute," as a recognized leader. While the risk
in any given year might be quite small, [**[there is almost certainly an
eventual]{.mark} global [extinction event.]{.mark} [With a growing
population and]{.mark} the speed of [destructive technological
advancements, the annual risk of humanity's downfall may be
increasing]{.mark}. When the inevitable is presented as a certain
future, or happens before we can react, what will be humanity's last
collective thought? Given our current technological prowess, perhaps
[the time to take action is now]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} During
a *Wall Street Journal* All Things Digital
conference,[^4^](https://www.potomacinstitute.org/steps/index.php/component/content/article/global-extinction-or-a-space-industrial-complex?catid=30&Itemid=101#notes) Elon
Musk said:

Either we spread Earth to other planets, or we risk going extinct. An
extinction event is inevitable and we're increasingly doing ourselves
in.

World renown physicist Steven Hawking agrees and recently told a
gathering at the Big
Think:[^5^](https://www.potomacinstitute.org/steps/index.php/component/content/article/global-extinction-or-a-space-industrial-complex?catid=30&Itemid=101#notes)

**[I believe that [the long-term future of the human race must be in

on planet Earth]{.mark} in the next hundred years, let alone the next
thousand, or million. [The human race shouldn't have all its eggs in one
basket]{.mark}, or on one planet. Let's hope we can avoid dropping the
basket until we have spread the load.]{.underline}**

[**The timing and the nature of this event remains truly unknown.
Predictions suggest an existential event may come from space or be the
product of our own hand, but we will likely remain ignorant of the cause
until its near arrival. What we do know is that if humanity is still
inhabiting only one planet, our unique life stories will be tragically
and permanently erased. Thus, [we confront the realization of the
likelihood of a global extinction event that we have]{.mark} absolutely
[no control over]{.mark}, that we currently have no defense for, [and no
plans to escape from]{.mark}.**]{.underline} We are deluded into
believing that since an extinction event is rare, it can not occur in
our lifetime. Consider the attitude expressed in the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory's Near Earth Object program's
website[^6^](https://www.potomacinstitute.org/steps/index.php/component/content/article/global-extinction-or-a-space-industrial-complex?catid=30&Itemid=101#notes) which
states:

On an average of every several hundred thousand years or so, asteroids
larger than a kilometer could cause global disasters ... No one should
be overly concerned about an Earth impact of an asteroid or comet. The
threat to any one person from auto accidents, disease, other natural
disasters and a variety of other problems is much higher than the threat
from \[Near Earth Objects\] NEOs. Over long periods of time, however,
the chances of the Earth being impacted are not negligible so that some
form of NEO insurance is warranted. At the moment, our best insurance
rests with the NEO scientists and their efforts to first find these
objects and then track their motions into the future. We need to first
find them, then keep an eye on them.

However, what will our response be if we find an NEO larger than a
kilometer that is on a collision course with Earth? A database is not an
insurance policy and leaves open the issue of an appropriate response.
Currently**[, [our only real hope lies with mitigation
strategies]{.mark} predicated on
intercepting]{.underline}****[[7](https://www.potomacinstitute.org/steps/index.php/component/content/article/global-extinction-or-a-space-industrial-complex?catid=30&Itemid=101#notes) or

objects. The former suggests using a robotic spacecraft that is weighted
or carries a nuclear explosive and the latter will redirect the NEO
object with a robotic spacecraft. [However]{.mark}, as NASA states in
their "Asteroid and Comet Watch"
website]{.underline}****[[9](https://www.potomacinstitute.org/steps/index.php/component/content/article/global-extinction-or-a-space-industrial-complex?catid=30&Itemid=101#notes) [a
response requires decades of warning time]{.mark} if the NEO object is
larger that a few hundred meters.]{.underline}**

**[We needed Sputnik to motivate our resolve for the domination of
space. The mental contrast of one day dreaming about space travel
through science fiction, and then seeing it live on television in the
living room, stimulated our imaginations. President Kennedy's speech
inspired a nation and the decade-long pursuit that saw a surge in
academic scholarship and technological advances. There are many
technologies and
spinoffs]{.underline}****[[10](https://www.potomacinstitute.org/steps/index.php/component/content/article/global-extinction-or-a-space-industrial-complex?catid=30&Itemid=101#notes) woven
into the fabric of the world culture that owe their birth to that speech
and subsequent technology development.]{.underline}**

**[Can we expect [the development of a humanity insurance policy]{.mark}
before a crisis begins? It might require funding of NASA at levels
similar to the 1960s, when we successfully landed men on the moon. It
might require the development of a space-industrial complex that could
help drive future economic growth. It [might require that we spread out
to other planets]{.mark} and achieve Earth independence [to stave off
global human extinction]{.mark}, even on our watch. [It]{.mark} does
[require that we take the threat, and its inevitability, seriously and
devote resources to preventing our extinction]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[The ancient seafarers were motivated to take risks for the sake of
curiosity and the desire for exploration and
resources.]{.underline}****[[11](https://www.potomacinstitute.org/steps/index.php/component/content/article/global-extinction-or-a-space-industrial-complex?catid=30&Itemid=101#notes) The
drive to leave the planet and set up colonies is similar: There is the
allure, the curiosity, the adventure, and the insurance. [It]{.mark}
could, and [should, be an international effort]{.mark} justified based
on the purpose of planning [for the preservation of
humanity.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[Since 2007]{.underline}** when a Russian submersible planted a
ceremonial Russian flag on the North Pole seabed, **[[Russia has
increased its military presence in the Arctic in various
ways]{.underline}]{.mark}**, provoking similar responses by the United
States and North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The Arctic has always
been important to Russia because it not only forms a core part of
Russian national identity and serves as an economic resource base, but
it is also perceived by Russia to be a critical area for its defense
capabilities. **[[Russia's increased military presence in the Arctic is
motivated by security concerns]{.underline}]{.mark}** primarily stemming
from two factors. The first factor is **[[Russia's perception of needing
to strengthen its self-defense capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
second factor is maintaining Russia's regional hegemony against what it
perceives as threatening efforts by the U.S. and NATO to contain its
influence in a strategically important region to Russia. However, the
implications of Russia's actions and the reactions by the U.S. and NATO
have the potential to threaten future Arctic security and stability.

recently,]{.underline} China has joined the list of "aggressors"
[allegedly]{.underline} threatening vital Western economic and strategic
interests in the High North. The Obama administration resisted calls for
a major Arctic buildup coming from a mix of armchair analysts, defense
contractors, and special political interests. Notably, the U.S. Navy has
never joined this chorus. Nobody denies [[the need for some new heavy
icebreakers to buttress an aging

turn. This is another historic mistake, not only because it could lead
to costly and dangerous confrontation in an extremely fragile region,
but because **[[its entire premise is false]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Once
a superpower rival in the High North, [Russia's Arctic presence imploded

dominant]{.underline}. [Retreating from rivalry, Russia joined other
regional states in a new Arctic Council that has proved a model of
shared global governance, fostering cooperation in areas from
environmental protection and search and rescue to commercial shipping
and fisheries.]{.underline} Importantly, Arctic Council members agreed
over a decade ago to settle any territorial disputes through the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea framework --- and have
scrupulously kept to that **[agreement]{.underline}**. **[[It is simply
false that Russia threatens]{.mark} to seize the North Pole seabed or

commitment of NATO members to each other and Russia's vision of its
security requirements, which emphasizes strategic depth and buffers to
shield it from perceived threats to the homeland, meet toe-to-toe along
the alliance's northern flank.

**[An outright military conflict in the Arctic would not be confined to
the region and would prove catastrophic for both sides]{.underline}**.
**[All the Arctic stakeholders have an obvious interest in avoiding such
an outcome]{.underline}**, as the result of either a deliberate or an

While Moscow may regard the prevailing world order---still widely
referred to as the liberal international order--- as unfavorable,
**[[Russia has shown strong support for a rules‐based order in the
Arctic]{.mark} region. Developments in the law of the sea from 1945
through the 1970s added vast maritime areas to the jurisdiction of the
coastal state. The legal concepts of a 200 nautical‐mile Exclusive
Economic Zone (EEZ) and the continental shelf, which in Russia's case
extends far into the Central Arctic Ocean, put an unimaginable wealth of
natural resources exclusively in Russian hands. The 1982 UN Convention
on the Law of the Sea further allows the Kremlin to regulate
international shipping through ice‐covered seas inside Russia's EEZ,
that is, most of the Northeast Passage (UN Convention on the Law of the
Sea, Art. 234). In its 2022 maritime doctrine, Moscow concluded that
maritime sovereign rights, obtained through gradual developments in the
law of the sea, had become vital to Russia's security and its very
existence (Russia Maritime Studies Institute, 2022). In addition to
legal developments, [Russia has played a defining role in exclusive
forums that have set the regional agenda and shaped Arctic
governance]{.mark} (Pedersen, 2012). These include [the Arctic
Council]{.mark} (the Arctic Eight), established as the preeminent forum
for international cooperation in the region, [and]{.mark} the even more
exclusive ad hoc constellation of states littoral to the Arctic Ocean
([the Arctic Five]{.mark}, i.e., Russia together with the US, Canada,
Denmark, and Norway; Pedersen, 2012). In Ilulissat in 2008, the Arctic
Five solemnly proclaimed they had a unique and special stewardship role
that derived from their "sovereignty, sovereign rights, and jurisdiction
in large parts of the Arctic Ocean" (Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
2008, p. 1). [Other regional arrangements]{.mark}, equally favorable to
Russia, [have included formal]{.mark} and informal [arrangements with
other Arctic states pertaining to]{.mark} issues such as
[fisheries]{.mark}, [s]{.mark}earch [a]{.mark}nd [r]{.mark}escue,
socio‐economic [development]{.mark}, and [nuclear prolif]{.mark}eration.
While Russia is a self‐declared revisionist state in the global system,
scholars assert that [Russia is a status quo advocate]{.mark} in an
Arctic regional sub‐system (e.g., Exner‐Pirot & Murray, 2017, p. 59).
Summarized by Konyshev and Sergunin (2014), most Russian experts argue
that: [Moscow does not pursue a revisionist policy in the
Arctic]{.mark}. [On the contrary]{.mark}, [Russia is a status quo power
which wants to solve all disputes in this region by peaceful
means]{.mark}, [with the help of i]{.mark}nternational [law]{.mark} and
international organizations]{.underline}**. (p. 324) This study finds
that Russia's seemingly incompatible mix of revisionist and status quo
ambitions may prove to be just that---incompatible. Data for the
following analysis has been drawn from governmental strategies and
policies, Arctic Council archive documents, member states' chairmanship
programs, academic publications, reports, new articles, and
commentaries.

#### Russia is not revisionist in the Arctic --- their evidence is posturing only 

**Buchanan 20** --- Elizabeth Buchanan lectures in strategic studies at
Deakin University delivering the defence and strategic studies course at
the Australian War College in Canberra, 2020 ("Russia and China in the

Accessed: 5/21/25)

China is also driven by the prestige a polar footprint brings, supported
by its icebreaker-building capabilities. Russia is aware of the
rationale behind China's Arctic strategy. Any efforts by Beijng to move
beyond the agreed terms of its arrangement with Moscow or failure to
uphold its observer status commitments will no doubt encourage deeper
cooperation among the Arctic-rim states. How closely China adheres to
the legal and sovereign Arctic arrangements will signal the limits to
its relationship with Russia.

Another **[[assumption, that Russia has an expansionist agenda in the
Arctic,]{.underline}]{.mark}** is generational but strategically
incapacitating. It **[[follows the notion that Moscow's military
modernisation and securitisation of Arctic policy]{.mark} and planning
[are indicators of neo-imperialist ambitions]{.mark}]{.underline}**
there. This concern is sharpened by the Kremlin's public affairs stunts
like planting the Russian flag on the seabed of the North Pole.

Russia's northwest Arctic zone has historically housed its nuclear-armed
Northern Fleet. This military capability, as well as the strategic
location and Soviet-era bastion policy of area denial, never really went
away with the fall of the Soviet Union. It fell into disrepair and,
under President Vladimir Putin, the military has undergone a vast
modernisation program. Moscow has reopened military bases along its
Arctic frontier. Geographically, Russia is the largest Arctic player,
and more than 50% of the Arctic Ocean is Russian coastline.

A 2008 US geological survey indicated that most of the region's oil and
natural gas lies in the Russian Arctic. Russia under
**[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}** has **[[renationalised energy as its
future economic base. Resource deposits in the Russian Arctic zone
(onshore and offshore) have immense economic
potential]{.mark}]{.underline}** and thus national security primacy.
**[[Russia's Arctic strategy is built on both economic security and
frontier border security objectives]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

**[[Securitising economic interests and increasing activity on the
Arctic border fall short of an expansionist agenda. Peel back the
posturing]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and the Arctic 'arms race', and
**[Russia's Arctic priority remains stability]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Continued regional cooperation with its NATO-member and Western Arctic
neighbours remains a central strategic objective. Keeping the arena free
of conflict is crucial to ensuring the Northern Sea Route remains open
and commercially viable. Russia needs to be able to deliver secure,
trusted and unimpeded energy supplies from its northern frontier to
Asian energy clients.

#### Russia isn't revisionist in the Arctic --- they simply want to defend the status quo order in the Arctic 

**Buchanan 20** --- Elizabeth Buchanan lectures in strategic studies at
Deakin University delivering the defence and strategic studies course at
the Australian War College in Canberra, 2020 ("Russia and China in the
Arctic: assumptions and realities," September 25,
https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/russia-and-china-in-the-arctic-assumptions-and-realities/
Accessed: 5/21/25)

**[[Russia's territorial and maritime disputes---notably with Norway in
the Barents Sea and the US in the Bering Strait---have long been
resolved. So, where in the Arctic is Moscow looking to expand? It's well
within Russia's interests to uphold the international legal architecture
of the Arctic, particularly UNCLOS, as agreed by
stakeholders]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This is a simple case of revenge of
geography.

A final assumption is that Russia has fallen into Beijing's debt-trap
diplomacy and that it is overreliant on Chinese capital and ownership in
joint ventures for energy projects in the Arctic. In reality, **[[Russia
has worked to offset Chinese investment]{.mark}]{.underline}** and the
risk of overreliance in energy ventures. That's a delicate balance. On
one side of the energy security 'coin', Russia relies on Chinese demand
for Arctic LNG, but Moscow has worked to diversify its capital pools.
Saudi Arabia, Japan, India and South Korea are all linked to Russian
Arctic energy ventures.

Russian law stipulates that while private Russian energy firms can
develop in the Arctic zone, they may not cede controlling stakes to
foreign firms. Neither of the two key LNG projects on the Russian
Arctic's Yamal Peninsula is 'owned' by China. Beijing's share in the
Yamal LNG venture is 29.9%, Russia's Novatek holds 50.1% and France's
Total holds 20%. In the Arctic-2 LNG project, China holds 20%, Novatek
holds 60%, Total holds 10% and the remaining 10% is held by a Japanese
consortium. We can expect Russia's upcoming Arctic energy projects
located near the Yamal Peninsula ventures to attract diverse capital
pools.

The Kremlin said Monday that **[[U.S.-Russia relations]{.mark} were [on
the brink of collapse]{.mark} and refused to confirm whether Russian
President Vladimir Putin had spoken with President Donald Trump, despite
Trump saying so Sunday.]{.underline}**

**[Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei [Ryabkov told a media

Washington]{.mark} "[are balancing on the brink of a breakup" and
reiterated that the war in Ukraine would last]{.mark} until Kyiv drops
its ambitions to join NATO and withdraws from the four regions occupied
by Russian forces.]{.underline}**

In remarks suggesting Moscow is maintaining its tough negotiating
stance, Ryabkov said that "we simply imperatively need to get \... the
new U.S. administration to understand and acknowledge that without
resolving the problems that are the root causes of the crisis in
Ukraine, it will not be possible to reach an agreement."

Trump confirms that he and Putin have spoken.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the same day that he would
"neither confirm nor deny" Trump\'s comments to reporters on Air Force
One on Sunday that he and Putin had spoken in his first officially
acknowledged contact with the Russian leader since 2022.

Referring to his contact with the Russian leader, Trump told reporters,
"let's just say I've had it \... and I expect to have many more
conversations. We have to get that war ended."

"I hate to see all these young people being killed. The soldiers are
being killed by the hundreds of thousands," he said, but declined to
provide any more details about how many times the two had spoken,
responding, "I'd better not say."

The remarks from Trump and spokespeople for the Kremlin come at a
crucial juncture for the war in Ukraine, with Kyiv and its European
neighbors nervously awaiting details of Trump\'s peace plan to end the
conflict that Russia launched with its full-scale invasion three years
ago.

Between winning election in November and being inaugurated last month,
Trump said he planned to end the war in a single day upon taking office.

Referring to Trump\'s remarks Sunday, Keir Giles, a senior fellow of the
Russia and Eurasia Program at the London think-tank Chatham House, said
"it would be tempting to think that this was all part of a careful plan
for not releasing information too early in order not to bridge this
process."

"Or it could simply be that, as seems to be the case with Trump's
earlier promises of immediate action to bring the conflict to an end,
that there isn't, in fact, a plan yet," he told NBC News.

Giles added that more clarity on the situation may come later this week,
with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy due to attend the
high-profile Munich Security Conference, which senior U.S. officials are
also attending.

Trump's national security adviser, Mike Waltz, told NBC News\' \"Meet
the Press\" on Sunday that the U.S. officials would be "talking through
the details of how to end this war and that will mean getting both sides
to the table."

Ukrainian cities [and Putin's desire to conquer]{.mark} "[ALL of
Ukraine]{.mark}, not just a piece of it."]{.underline}**

Trump also took a vague shot at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy
("everything out of his mouth causes problems"), and one could point out
that Russia has been striking civilian targets in Ukraine and expressing
a desire to snuff out Ukraine's political independence since the very
beginning of the war.

**[[Trump followed up by]{.mark} telling reporters he

Accessed: 6/24/25)

Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump at Summit

Despite seemingly encouraging signs**[[, the US--Russia relationship is
fundamentally unhealthy]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[Even after the expulsion of Russian diplomats from the US, the
[imposition of additional sanctions on Moscow, and a dramatic standoff
over chemical attacks in Syria]{.mark},]{.underline}** the US and
Russian leaders remain optimistic about how much they can achieve
together.

President Donald Trump has declared that 'there is no reason for' the
crisis in US--Russia relations and said that 'we need all nations to
work together'. And President Vladimir Putin has insisted that Russian
officials curb anti-American rhetoric so as to not offend Washington at
a critical moment.

Yet, persistent fear of the conclusion of a Russo-American 'grand
bargain' is misplaced; no rapprochement is in the offing, even if Putin
visits Washington.

Trump is too constrained to effect a reconciliation with Russia -- by
public opinion, Congress and those administration officials sceptical of
his instincts. And, rhetoric aside, Trump has matched and, in certain
respects, surpassed his predecessor Barack Obama, in containing and
punishing Russia, notwithstanding his personal policy preferences as
articulated prior to and during the presidential campaign.

Just how much of that owes to a clear desire to silence those who charge
him with colluding with and being soft on Moscow -- as well as his
tendency to defer to more experienced foreign policy practitioners
within his administration who take a more clear-eyed view of Russia --
is unclear.

However, these explanations supersede the dubious claim that Trump's
Russia policy is the result of his maturation in office; his rhetoric on
Russia largely continues to reflect his personal policy preferences and
only the president's most passionate supporters argue that he can truly
claim as his own the course his administration has charted.

News reports have tended to identify either the removal of sanctions or
a free hand in Ukraine as the prize most coveted by Russia

It more resembles the result of intense pressure from various actors in
US politics -- especially Congress, which took the remarkable step of
limiting the president's ability to suspend or lift sanctions on Russia
last summer. Such pressure and restrictions preclude Trump from making a
tactical trade-off, much less concluding a 'grand bargain' addressing
the fundamental problems plaguing the US--Russia relationship.

In speculating about a potential 'grand bargain' between Putin and
Trump, news reports have tended to identify either the removal of
sanctions or a free hand in Ukraine as the prize most coveted by Russia.

For his part, Trump has fuelled speculation over the possibility of a
'grand bargain' between himself and Putin by repeatedly emphasising that
he is uniquely equipped to improve US--Russia relations.

However, such concessions -- as well as others contemplated by those few
administration officials who share Trump's instincts on Russia -- are
not only impossible to make in today's political climate, but also
undeserving of the label of 'grand bargain'.

The gains they promise in relation to US--Russia relations are
essentially tactical, since, rather than reach a consensus on areas of
fundamental disagreement between Russia and the US -- the norm of
non-interference in domestic affairs, international legal exceptionalism
and the structure of the international order -- Trump has preferred to
focus on specific crises such as those in Syria and Ukraine, mere
symptoms of a clash of worldviews.

**[[Despite the nearly universal expectation that Trump would or will
'give Russia what it wants', his administration has clearly rebuffed
Moscow']{.mark}s efforts to address its vital interests]{.underline}**

**[Indeed, Russia's security requires assurances that the US will allow
Moscow to embrace international legal exceptionalism -- selective
compliance with international law -- and recognise Russia as a great
power to be consulted, reckoned with, and respected.]{.underline}**

**[Despite the nearly universal expectation that Trump would or will
'give Russia what it wants', his administration has clearly rebuffed
Russia's efforts to address its vital interests or at least initiate a
bilateral conversation on areas of [fundamental
disagreement.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[Most [notably, in Trump's first year in office, Russia unsuccessfully
pushed for an agreement to mutually refrain from interfering in each
other's politics;]{.mark}]{.underline}** it continues to seek a pledge
of the sort today.

As an unnamed State Department official told BuzzFeed News: 'We would
have to give up democracy promotion in Russia, which we're not willing
to do'.

Between the refusal to abandon democracy promotion, the embrace of
international legal exceptionalism, best personified in the form of
Trump's new National Security Advisor, John Bolton, and his vocal
opposition to the erosion of US hegemony in international affairs,
Russia is unlikely to make any progress on those issues at the heart of
its insecurity. Nor should it expect any tactical trade-offs in light of
the political climate in the US and its impact on Trump's Russia policy.

One Republican Senator even wants to have Russia designated as a state
sponsor of terrorism

And that goes for not only this administration, but also for the next,
especially if Trump's successor comes from the Democratic Party.
Traumatised by its defeat in the 2016 presidential election and
convinced, rightly or wrongly, that it occurred primarily because of
foreign interference, Democrats are increasingly opposed to any
cooperation with Russia or concessions to it, tactical or otherwise.

A joint **[[cyber security unit proposed by Trump following his first
meeting with Putin was attacked]{.underline}]{.mark}** by Democrats (and
Republicans) as 'dangerously naive'; some even moved to prohibit such
cooperation through legislation.

When in December 2017 the CIA shared information that helped Russia's
Federal Security Service to foil a terrorist attack in St Petersburg,
one member of the Democratic foreign policy establishment reacted by
declaring that Putin was 'still courting Trump', while former Director
of National Intelligence James Clapper remarked that Putin was
'handl\[ing\] Trump like an asset'.

Democratic Senators have spoken out against any kind of counterterrorism
cooperation, and one Republican Senator even wants to have Russia
designated as a state sponsor of terrorism.

The persistent anxiety of US commentators about the possibility of the
conclusion of **[[a 'grand bargain' between Putin and Trump bears little
resemblance to reality;]{.underline}]{.mark}** Russia's foreign policy
establishment is increasingly concerned that even tactical cooperation
is no longer possible.

However distressing it may appear to some that the president has invited
the country's main adversary to Washington, that should not distract
from the political impossibility of meaningful Russia--US cooperation.

For, with or without a visit to Washington by Putin, **[[the fundamental
problems plaguing US--Russia relations will persist for years to
come]{.underline}]{.mark}** and only grow under a Democratic occupant of
the White House.

**[Trump Thumps --- 2AC]{.underline}**

**Trump thumps --- angry with Putin over Ukraine remarks**

**Rosenberg 25** --- Steve Rosenberg is the Russia Editor for the BBC,
2025 ("Rosenberg: Trump takes US-Russia relations on rollercoaster
ride," April 4, https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx27yqld0qpo Accessed:
6/24/25)

If I was writing a Russian language course for 2025, Lesson One would
definitely contain the phrase for rollercoaster: Amerikanskiye gorki.

It means, literally, American Hills.

How appropriate.

After all, with President Donald Trump now operating the ride, and
Vladimir Putin pressing some of the buttons, **[[US-Russian relations
have]{.underline}]{.mark}** become one of late, with **[[highs and lows
and twists and turns]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

**[[You never know quite where you are]{.underline}]{.mark}** now.

Analysing geopolitical trends is hard enough at the best of times. It\'s
even harder careering along on the American Hills of the 47th US
president.

When Trump returned to the White House in January, his direction of
travel was clear: he set out to repair relations with Russia.

There were Trump/Putin phone calls, high-level US-Russia negotiations.
At one point Washington voted with Moscow against a UN resolution that
identified Russia as the \"aggressor\" in Russia\'s war against Ukraine.

Whenever the Trump administration exerted pressure, it was always on
Kyiv, never on the Kremlin.

But a week or so ago the rollercoaster ride began.

holding a piece of paperVyacheslav PROKOFYEV/POOL/ AFP

**[[Trump made it known he was angry with]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**n president\'s comments

After Vladimir **[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}** had **[[proposed
replacing]{.underline}]{.mark}** President Volodymyr **[[Zelensky\'s
administration with \"external governance\" in
Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}** under the auspices of the UN, President
Trump made it known that he was \"angry\" with **[Putin.]{.underline}**

\"I was disappointed in a certain way, some of the things that were said
over the last day or two having to do with Zelensky,\" Trump commented
on 30 March. \"Because when \[Putin\] considers Zelensky not credible,
he\'s supposed to be making a deal with him. Whether you like him or you
don\'t like him.\"

After a day playing golf with Trump, the president of Finland, Alexander
Stubb, told the Guardian newspaper: \"I think
**[[America]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and my sense is also the president
of the United States, **[[is running out of patience with
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\"

**[[Trump threatened to impose]{.underline}]{.mark}** secondary
**[[tariffs]{.underline}]{.mark}** of up to 50% **[[on Russian oil
exports]{.underline}]{.mark}** if Russia was found to be dragging its
heels on a Ukraine peace deal.

A bi-partisan group of US senators has gone even further.

They\'ve drawn up a bill that would impose 500% secondary tariffs on
countries that purchase Russian oil, gas and other resources.

Up to this point the Russian press had been welcoming the thaw in
relations between Moscow and Washington. The Nezavisimaya Gazeta
newspaper last month ran a headline stating that US and Russian
officials had \"started speaking the same language\".

This week things changed.

On Wednesday, Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper accused the Trump
administration of \"administrative insanity... inexperience...
immaturity\".

It criticised the administration\'s \"bragging and arrogance\" and \"its
desire to declare \'huge breakthroughs\' when the first steps have
barely been taken\".

The same day, Komsomolskaya Pravda declared: \"On Ukraine talks,
**[[Donald\'s mood changes as often as the
wind.]{.underline}]{.mark}**\"

[Signs, perhaps, of]{.underline} **[[a cold wind blowing between Moscow
and Washington]{.underline}]{.mark}**?

And yet then Trump announced his sweeping tariffs this week, Russia
wasn\'t on the list.

Instead, US authorities had organised a sanctions waiver for a key
Kremlin official: Putin\'s foreign investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev.

Dmitriev flew into Washington for talks with the Trump administration.

A sign, perhaps, of Russia and America getting on with the business
of... getting along?

But on Friday, another warning from Washington to Moscow. This time at a
meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Brussels.

\"President Trump\'s not going to fall into the trap of endless
negotiations about negotiations,\" said US Secretary of State Marco
Rubio.

\"We will know soon enough, in a matter of weeks, not months, whether
Russia is serious about peace or not.\"

Marco Rubio said Trump would not fall into the \"trap of endless
negotiations about negotiations\"

\"If they\'re not,\" he continued, \"then we\'ll have to re-evaluate
where we stand and what we do moving forward about it.\"

This followed criticism of Russia by America\'s Nato allies. UK Foreign
Secretary David Lammy said Putin \"continues to obfuscate, continues to
drag his feet\".

\"He could accept a ceasefire now, he continues to bombard Ukraine... We
see you, Vladimir Putin, we know what you are doing.\"

Earlier on Friday there were rumours that Trump and Putin were about to
speak again on the phone. These were followed by more rumours: the White
House had changed its mind.

**No link --- US-Russia relations inevitable, Arctic cooperation will
prevail**

**Jordan 21** --- Jonathan Jordan is a final-year undergraduate student
at the University of Indonesia, 2021 ("Russia's Coercive Diplomacy in
the Arctic," July 6,
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/russia-coercive-diplomacy-arctic/
Accessed: 6/24/25)

The case of great power relations in the Arctic is applicable to the
second and third components of Schelling's concept as well. Russia has
built a credible presence in the Arctic, which is shown through its
military and economic influence in the region as explained above.13) The
state also maintains significant power projection capabilities in the
Arctic, which supports its goal of being seen as a global power by the
United States. While the American National Security Strategy document
has put Russia, alongside China, as revisionist powers which pose the
greatest challenges to American strategy, there is still a strong view
among American policymakers and specialists that Russia is no longer a
global power and not able to seriously challenge American global
hegemony.14) Russia views this as concerning because if the United
States does not see Russia as a global power, it fears that the United
States would not respect its security interests. By holding enough
military and economic strongholds in the Arctic, Russia shows that its
power projection is strong enough and should not be underestimated by
the United States. This fulfills the second element of Schelling's
concept, wherein Russia is a credible threat to the United States in the
Arctic, while at the same time, it is not making demands or ultimatums
regarding American military presence in the Arctic either. A Valdai Club
report outlined several disputes between both countries in the Arctic,
and it can be observed that Russia does not give fast demands or threats
regarding the disputes. This is in line with the third element of
Schelling's concept.15)

Finally, we will examine the fourth and fifth elements of Schelling's
concept. **[[Despite Russia and the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[being two global adversaries whose rivalry has become especially heated
in recent years, both countries have managed to maintain a tone of
cooperation and some kind of trust in the

**[[cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}** to mitigate threats and
challenges, such as the need to avoid military conflicts in the region,
the need to ensure each nation's national security **[[in the Arctic,
and the urgency of environmental effects in the
region]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- **[[which resonates well with Russia's
concerns regarding thawing permafrost]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the
north. **[[Russia's Foreign Policy Strategy states that it is "a policy
aimed at preserving peace, stability, and constructive international
cooperation" and "settling any regional issues with
negotiation]{.underline}]{.mark}**".16) Similarly, the American Arctic
Strategy published by the Department of Defense also indicates the need
for "multilateral cooperation to address shared interests and
challenges" which includes cooperation on scientific research, maritime
traffic, and environmental issues.17) In addition, Russia and the United
States have also agreed on the delimitation of its maritime borders
between Chukotka and Alaska, which was signed in 1990, though the
Russian Parliament has not yet ratified the agreement. Nevertheless, the
official statement by both countries regarding international
**[[relations in the Arctic show that both countries share a level of
trust and see i]{.mark}nternational [r]{.mark}elations [in the region as

**Increasing US science diplomacy improves US-Russia relations -- spills
over to international collaboration and solving global tensions**

**Langenhove and Piaget 23** - Luk Van Langenhove is the director of the
Comparative Regional Integration Studies Institute of the United Nations
University, Belgium. He is also a professor in International Affairs at
the Brussels School of Governance; Eric Piaget is a PhD Fellow at

rotational leadership mechanisms of multilateral regional
organizations. (6-7-2023; "Rebuilding European Bridges: Science

At the time of writing, the **[[war]{.mark} in Ukraine [shows]{.mark}
[little promise of ending soon]{.mark}. As the fighting passed the
one-year mark, both Russia and Ukraine were preparing attacks to deliver
decisive blows to the other side. As the West steps up its armaments to
Kiev, Russia fills its depleting ranks with civilians and convicts. An
increasingly desperate Putin may consider filling his hitherto empty
threats of a nuclear strike. There are many unknowns in this unfolding
tragedy; making predictions with certainty is a fool's
errand.]{.underline}**

**[However, with history as a guide, it is safe to assume that this war
will end one day. Every war fought in the past, no matter its duration
and degree of brutality, eventually came to its end. When this war
follows that trend, it is important to think about how wounds can heal,
and how bridges can be rebuilt. For the purpose of this note, we will
look at this through science diplomacy, and how the EU can play an
active role in delivering a sustainable peace through
science.]{.underline}**

**[[Science diplomacy]{.mark} can be [used]{.mark} [to build
bridges]{.mark} between countries that have strained political
relations[. It can]{.mark} [be]{.mark} a [powerful]{.mark} tool [for
fostering collaboration]{.mark} and mutual understanding, even between
countries that have icy political relations and a violent history.
Funding for joint research projects and scientific exchanges are some
ways science diplomacy can help to (re)build bridges and promote
dialogue between countries. Of course, to do this vis-à-vis Ukraine and
Russia, there will need to be an appetite for rapprochement. As it
stands, little desire for that exists between the parties. However,
scientific cooperation in projects of shared concern could constitute
the small steps towards a wider phase of rapprochement.]{.underline}**

**[[Science diplomacy]{.mark} can also be used to promote shared values
and policies, such as the importance of open and transparent research,
in international interactions. This can help to [create a common ground
for]{.mark} [collaboration]{.mark}]{.underline}** and can foster trust
and mutual understanding between countries, as well as serve as the
watershed for ushering Western values into non-like minded states.

[**Addressing global challenges is another key aspect to consider in the
post-conflict situation. [Science diplomacy addresses a wide range
of]{.mark} global [challenges]{.mark}, such as [climate]{.mark} change,
[pandemics]{.mark}, and [natural disasters]{.mark}. The
[promotion]{.mark} [of]{.mark} international [collaborations]{.mark} on
scientific research and technology development can [help to find
solutions]{.mark} to these challenges**]{.underline} and improve the
lives of people around the world. Using this as a banner can hardly be
controversial, so long as the science does not have a dual-use nature,
or other hard power benefits that sustain belligerence.

In a similar sense, **[science diplomacy can be used to support
sustainable development. Science and technology can play a crucial role
in supporting sustainable development and the SDGs, such as by
developing innovative technologies for clean energy and sustainable
agriculture. Science can be a vessel to promote international
collaboration on these issues and to support the development and
deployment of sustainable technologies in Russia and Ukraine.
Considering one of the greatest globally tangible impacts of the war has
been on the world's food supply, and that the Black Sea Grain Initiative
has been one of the few diplomatic breakthroughs during the conflict,
agriculture could be fertile ground upon which to focus.]{.underline}**

**[[Science diplomacy]{.mark} is also a way to [foster innovation and
econ]{.mark}omic [development]{.mark}. Both [Russia]{.mark} and Ukraine
will [have]{.mark} their [economies in tatters]{.mark} after the war,
which is why this is an important consideration. Economic recovery needs
innovations and science. An equivalent of the Marshall plan after the
Second World War will be needed and it should envisage support to
science, technology, and innovation.]{.underline}**

**[Civil society empowerment is another factor to consider. Science
diplomacy is typically focused on interactions between states, but it
can also be used to engage with non-state actors, such as NGOs, research
institutions, and private companies. By fostering collaboration and
exchange of ideas with these actors, science diplomacy can help to
promote innovation and address global challenges in new and creative
ways. In the context of Russia and Ukraine, it could be a gust of wind
into the sails of civil society in these countries (particularly in
Russia, where civil society has been increasingly under
attack).]{.underline}**

[**Most importantly, however, [science diplomacy]{.mark} can be used to
[promote peace and security]{.mark}, such as [by]{.mark}
[developing]{.mark} innovative [tech]{.mark}nologies [for conflict
resolution, peacekeeping, and disarmament]{.mark}. Science
[diplomacy]{.mark}, if done correctly, can [promote]{.mark}
international [collaboration]{.mark} on these issues and foster mutual
understanding and trust between countries. Just [look at
SESAME]{.mark}**, and other examples]{.underline} that use science as a
means of cooperation between parties with turbulent political
relationships (e.g., [India and Pakistan and the joint work conducted
under the Indus Waters Treaty]{.underline}; or [countries of former
Yugoslavia working together in the framework of SEEIIST]{.underline}).

Conclusions

Once hostilities between Russia and Ukraine cease, tensions are expected
to continue while the situation on the ground remains fragile. This
affects the EU, as an unstable neighborhood causes problems such as
increased migration and risk of political extremism. Within that
context, a strategic science diplomacy action is desirable to mobilize
scientific and technological research potential. By strengthening
interactions between scientists from Ukraine, Russia, and the EU, it can
be hoped that relations between the three partners can be improved.

There are three major areas of societal reconstruction where science
diplomacy can play a decisive role. The first one is to leverage science
to enhance economic reconstruction. This can be achieved by building
infrastructures for science that directly support economic productivity
and by implementing measures to combat brain drain. In this way, science
diplomacy acts as a facilitator for economic reconstruction by fostering
an environment that nurtures scientific and technological advancement.
This involves building infrastructures for science and measures to
combat brain drain.

A second major goal is to construct resilient structures and
opportunities for scientific collaboration between Russian and Ukrainian
scientists. The premise is that trust may develop over time but should
not be the central objective. The key is to provide an arena where
differences can be set aside in the name of scientific progress. The EU,
being a mediator in this scenario, has a vital role to play.

Thirdly, the EU, as a scientific powerhouse, needs to bolster its
bilateral and trilateral cooperation with both Ukraine and Russia. This
will create an interconnected scientific community resilient to
political fluctuations. Implementing these three policies simultaneously
will be a challenge, but the EU has good reasons to invest in such an
endeavor: it will contribute to stability at its borders, and it will
help generate the support needed to develop its ambition of maximizing
the mobilization of science towards global challenges such as climate
change, pandemics, and nuclear security.

Strategic EU science diplomacy action on Ukraine and Russia should start
from a set of strategic goals that can be realized through programmatic
actions. To ensure a rapid operationalization, existing instruments
should be used where possible.

The following strategic goals could be considered by the EU:

Contribute to the re-building of Ukraine's science system.

Contribute to the maximal integration of Ukraine's science system into
the ERA (European Research Area).

Support and encourage collaboration between Russian and Ukrainian
scientists, especially on the global challenges humanity faces.

Contribute to the re-integration of the Russian science system into the
global science system, and strengthen collaboration between Russia and
the EU on a case-by-case basis aimed at tackling global challenges.

Combat the expected scientific brain drain from Russia and Ukraine to
the EU.

Support and coordinate EU Member State initiatives towards scientific
and technological collaboration with Russia and Ukraine.

**[Science [diplomacy]{.mark}, while potent, is not a magical cure-all
for the pursuit of peace and prosperity. It does, however, [serve as a
fundamental driver]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the dynamics of
[i]{.mark}nternational [r]{.mark}elations: fostering cooperation,
fueling competition, and at times, enabling domination. [Harnessing
cooperation]{.mark} and ensuring it does not give rise to dynamics that
could threaten peace and exacerbate tensions [is key]{.mark} in this
case. Today\'s]{.underline}** reality necessitates acknowledging that
major challenges, such as climate change, are a collective burden, too
immense for any single state to tackle alone. We are past the era where
bystanders can be tolerated. Every state, regardless of size, alliances,
or historical enmities, must participate in a global mobilization of
science that promotes openness and values collaboration for addressing
shared challenges.

In his recent interview with The Economist, Henry Kissinger articulated
that lasting peace in Europe requires two significant shifts in
perspective. The first is for Ukraine to become fully integrated into
the Western security architecture. The second "is for Europe to engineer
a rapprochement with Russia, as a way to create a stable eastern
border." \[11\] Science may very well be the best place for such a
rapprochement to start. From our standpoint, this picture transcends
political landscapes. The need to support Russian and Ukrainian
scientists in rebuilding their capacities should be perceived not as a
regional issue, but as an opportunity for global cooperation, a step
towards mobilizing science to confront the overarching challenges that
face humanity[**. [This is a path we should]{.mark} not only consider,

[Reflections and Implications for the Region]{.underline}

[From this analysis of Russia's coercive diplomacy towards the United
States in the Arctic, it can be seen that]{.underline} **[[Russia values
cooperation and stability for its national Arctic development, as well
as tackling]{.mark}]{.underline}** various **[[shared issues in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** [such as environmental issues.
Therefore]{.underline}, **[[it understands and respects the importance
of a stable relationship with all Arctic powers, including the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates. This is
reflected by Russia's aim for continuous dialogue with the United States
for international cooperation in the Arctic. However, the Russian state
also sees that in order to gain a stable and positive-sum cooperation,
the country needs to diplomatically coerce the United States to
recognize its importance and interests in the region. Russia's coercive
diplomacy is carried out to ensure that the United States sees it as an
important power in the region whose interests should not be ignored, and
that it should be treated equally as a global actor and regional leader
in the Arctic.

While Russia's coercive diplomacy towards the United States in the
Arctic region has raised alarms in the US about increased Russian
activity in the region, it has also opened a path for more constructive
cooperation between the two countries in the north. Fortunately, the
United States has also stepped in for more constructive dialogues
between both countries, despite the more confrontational tone displayed
in other regions in the US-Russia rivalry. This reluctant cooperation is
further seen in the institutional arrangements in the Arctic, as
evidenced by the membership of both countries in the Arctic Council.
**[[Although tension remains between the two]{.mark} states, [with the
rising militarization of the region, the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[and Russia are expected to have a relatively more cooperative tone in
bilateral relations in the Arctic than other regions of the
world,]{.mark} which is an important achievement considering the
importance of Arctic issues for humankind, such as climate change and
shipping routes across the Arctic]{.underline}**. This relationship is
also important for other Arctic countries, such as the Scandinavian
countries, Canada, Iceland, and Finland, to maximize the use of existing
mechanisms in the region, such as the Arctic Council, as well as to
ensure that the forum does not become an instrument of great power
competition between these two powers.

Perhaps more importantly, since there is currently no Arctic security
forum that includes Russia, Arctic states should use NATO's established
dialogue channels with Moscow through the NATO-Russia Council, as Dr.
Rebecca Pincus has advocated. While NATO's military function would be
counterproductive, its political-organizational function could help to
lower the likelihood of miscommunication. This forum would also open the
possibility for greater collaboration on rules to govern the region as
it becomes more accessible to other actors.

### Relations Not Zero-Sum --- 2AC

**US-Russia relations are compartmentalized. One area doesn't spill over

Broaden our focus. **[[One common]{.mark} cause of [failure in]{.mark}
dealing with [a wicked problem is to treat it as]{.mark} if it were [a
narrow linear problem]{.mark}, rooted in a single or primary cause that
can be resolved through a focused and determined effort. [The
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has [repeatedly crashed into this]{.mark}
shoal [in]{.mark} its [attempts to deal with Russia]{.mark} since the
Cold War's end. [We]{.mark} have habitually [sought to
compartmentalize]{.mark} issues, [preferring to focus on]{.mark}
disputes that are salient to U.S. domestic politics and on [selective
opportunities]{.mark} that we hope will advance American goals. We have
tended to look for primary causes of bilateral maladies, recently
attributing the growing dangers in the U.S.-Russian relationship to the
nature of Putinism and Russia's endemic expansionism, believing resolute
counter-pressure will quell Russian appetites for aggression.
[We]{.mark} have attempted to [seek progress through incremental
steps]{.mark}, [in the hope]{.mark} that [making headway on]{.mark} such
issues as counter-[terror]{.mark}ism [can]{.mark} [build
momentum]{.mark} toward larger U.S.-Russian success. [This
incremental]{.mark} and compartmentalized [approach]{.mark} makes
abundant sense intuitively. Why complicate things, when one can break
the problem down into its component parts and focus on what is most
salient or easily achievable? It is also driven by the bureaucratic silo
effect, which encourages narrow specialization while discouraging
cross-organizational integration. But it [has not worked]{.mark} in
practice. [Despite]{.mark} our [best efforts, the]{.mark} U.S.-Russian
[relationship has spiraled]{.mark} ever deeper [into]{.mark} dysfunction
and [distrust]{.mark} from administration to administration since the
end of the Cold War. As planning expert Russell Ackoff has observed
about "messes," his term for wicked problems, "[if we]{.mark} do the

problems]{.mark} and then try to solve each one separately, [we will not

#### No US-China war --- China military ill equipped, inexperienced, domestic factors check 

**Keary 25** --- Joe Keary is a senior analyst at The Australian

Stronger, But Taiwan Invasion in 2025 is Unlikely," February 23,

**[[Despite China's rapid military improvements, it's unlikely to use
large-scale force]{.underline}]{.mark}** against Taiwan in 2025. The
**[[Chinese leadership's concerns over the quality of military command,
economic weakening, uncertain social stability, and effects of]{.mark}
the [Trump]{.mark} administration will likely [forestall any large-scale
military maneuver.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

However, China will continue to ramp up pressure against Taiwan in 2025.

On January 6, the United States' new defense secretary, Pete Hegseth,
told the Senate Armed Services Committee he believed a Chinese Communist
Party fait accompli invasion of Taiwan was the pacing risk scenario for
the Department of Defense. He reminded the committee that \"Xi Jinping
has openly expressed his intention to annex Taiwan to mainland China\"
and \"has told his military to be prepared to use force to achieve such
an outcome by 2027.\"

Like its successes in artificial intelligence, improvements in China's
military should not be underestimated. In several areas, China's
military is now reaching standards typical of the US military. China's
navy is transforming rapidly and by the end of 2025 is expected to have
395 ships, including three operational aircraft carriers. China is also
improving its amphibious fleet, acquiring assault ships that can carry
large numbers of landing craft, troops, fixed-wing drones, armored
vehicles, and helicopters. In early 2025, there were reports of China
building special barges that would support Taiwan landings.

China's military now has the largest aviation force in the region, with
new fighters and stealth aircraft that expand its ability to operate
farther from its shores. It is also increasing its inventory of nuclear
weapons and now has the world's leading arsenal of hypersonic missiles.
The army has increased the number of troops along the Taiwan Strait and
improved its firepower, mobility, and rapid strike capabilities.

Throughout 2024, China's military and coast guard continued to exercise
Taiwan invasion and blockade scenarios. In May, following the
inauguration of Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te, Beijing launched
large-scale military exercises, surrounding Taiwan within two days. In
October, it undertook a second series of drills, taking just one day to
implement a mock blockade or quarantine of Taiwan. In December, China
staged its largest show of force in decades, showing the world how it
could repel a foreign force approaching Taiwan.

The military has dramatically improved its ability to conduct a blockade
or invasion, but **[[Beijing]{.mark} will still [have
doubts]{.mark}]{.underline}**. During the release of the 2024 China
Military Power Report, senior Pentagon officials said, \"**[[despite its
rapid progress, the force has not]{.mark} yet [demonstrated the]{.mark}
type and [scale of sophisticated]{.mark} urban [warfare or]{.mark}
long-distance [logistic capabilities that would]{.mark} likely [be
required]{.mark}]{.underline}** for operations against Taiwan.\" **[[A
lack of combat experience is a significant imposition]{.mark} for a
force wanting to undertake complicated operations]{.underline}** across
the Taiwan Strait. **[[Exercising will only get you so
far]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Serious questions have also been asked about China's officer corps and
their ability to 'judge situations, understand higher authorities'
intentions, make operational decisions, deploy troops, and deal with
unexpected situations'. Corruption also remains an endemic issue, with
China's military experiencing a new wave of corruption-related scandals
over the past two years that has led to the removal of two defense
ministers and a high-ranking member of China's Central Military
Commission.

**[[Domestic factors]{.mark} will [also]{.mark} influence any decision
to use military force. [China is facing adverse demographic trends,
including an aging population and low birth rates. There are other
internal struggles,]{.mark} such as a trend of rising violence,
following a string of indiscriminate mass attacks throughout
2024.]{.underline}**

**[China is also seeking to manage [a faltering
economy]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[worsened by ballooning local
government debt, a loss of investor confidence and the gradual collapse
of its real estate sector.]{.underline}** Beijing has struggled to
stimulate domestic consumption, relying on its growing share of global
exports to drive the economy. Researchers at Rhodium Group estimated
that China's GDP was only 2.4 to 2.8 percent higher in 2024 than a year
earlier, well below the official claim of 5.0 percent growth.

**[AT: Warming ! Defense --- 2AC]{.underline}**

**No warming impact---the [geological record]{.underline} proves
survival.**

**Thorstad 23**, PhD, Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Vanderbilt
University. (David, 1-28-2023, \"Exaggerating the risks (Part 4:
Halstead continued),\" Reflective Altruism,
https://reflectivealtruism.com/2023/01/28/exaggerating-the-risks-part-4-halstead-continued/)

But I will bite. I think Halstead is quite convincing in arguing that
the paleoclimate **[[data does not give]{.mark} us good [reason to
expect climate change to bring about]{.mark} irreversible existential
[catastrophe]{.mark} any time soon, [and]{.mark} probably [gives]{.mark}
us [good reason to expect]{.mark} that [it won't.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[The first thing to note is that the earth has been much hotter in the
past than even the most dire warming projections predict it will soon
become. [During the]{.mark} Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum
([PETM]{.mark}) 55 million years ago, [the earth was]{.mark} an
astounding 14-[17°]{.mark}C [above]{.mark} the pre-industrial average,
but species extinctions were limited. Here is Halstead:]{.underline}**

**[Overall, in the PETM, temperatures were upwards of 17°C higher than
pre-industrial levels and the only species that went extinct that we
know of was a single-celled marine organism, and on land it was a time
of ecological flourishing, persistence and diversity.]{.underline}**

**[But if the scorching temperatures of the PETM did not lead to
existential catastrophe, why believe that lower levels of warming will
now destroy humanity? We saw in Part 2 that even Ord seems concerned by
this thought:]{.underline}**

**[The best argument against ... unknown mechanisms \[for extinction\]
is probably that [the PETM]{.mark} \[Paleocene--Eocene Thermal Maximum\]
[did not lead to a mass extinction, despite temp]{.mark}erature[s
rapidly rising]{.mark} about 5 degrees Celsius, to reach a level of 14
degrees]{.underline}** Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures.

Toby Ord, The precipice

However, Ord suggests that even though the PETM was hotter than the 21st
century will be, warming during the PETM was slower than the rapid
warming we are now experiencing:

Most importantly, anthropogenic warming could be over a hundred times
faster than warming during the PETM, and rapid warming has been
suggested as a contributing factor in the end-Permian mass extinction,
in which 96 percent of species went extinct.

Toby Ord, The precipice

Fair enough. But Halstead has something to say about that too.

Citing Willis and MacDonald (2011), Halstead reminds us that **[[we have
seen rapid warming before]{.mark}:]{.underline}**

**[a. In Greenland, temperatures may have risen by 10°C, though this may
be an error in climate proxies.]{.underline}**

**[b. In [the Swiss Alps]{.mark} and other parts of Europe, a warming of
2 to 5°C appears to have occurred in 200 years or less.]{.underline}**

**[c. In the [Sierra Nevada]{.mark} of California, rates of warming in
the late glacial may have been 4 to 5°C every 500 years around 15,000
years ago.]{.underline}**

**[d. At the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, there were
increases of 5°C and more over a few decades (11,700 years
ago).]{.underline}**

**[e. Data from [Greenland ice cores]{.mark} [suggest]{.mark} that a
\>[10°]{.mark}C [warming]{.mark} may have [occurred over]{.mark} 20 to
[6 years]{.mark}]{.underline}** (13,000 to 11,000 years ago).

f\. In California, warming at the close of the Younger Dryas (13,000
years ago) may have been on the order of 3°C in less than 100 to 200
years.

g\. For the entire Southwest US, a general warming of 4°C may have
occurred in less than a century (13,000 to 11,000 years ago).

Halstead, Climate change and longtermism

Just as **[[history gives us abundant ev]{.mark}idence [of]{.mark} large
mammals [surviving temperatures hotter than]{.mark} the earth is
projected to be by 2100, history also gives us evidence of survival at
rates of warming comparable to the [worst-case scenarios]{.mark} in the
IPCC report.]{.underline}**

**[Even the worst-looking scenarios give cause for comfort. For example,
[in]{.mark} the beginning of [the Holocene]{.mark} (\~10,000 BCE),
climate change did seem to play a role in the extinction of megafauna
(large animals). But there is little evidence of plant extinctions, and
many megafauna survived. In particular, Halstead notes, [humans]{.mark}
lived, and by all appearances [thrived]{.mark} during this time. And as
for the megafauna who perished, a live scientific hypothesis is the
overkill hypothesis: they died because we killed and ate them. (Halstead
assigns this 90% credence, but notes that many scientists may be closer
to 50%). All of this gives us every reason for confidence that [today's
humans, with]{.mark} greater numbers, [tech]{.mark}nology, [and
forewarning]{.mark} than our ancestors, [can survive]{.mark} ongoing
climate catastrophe.]{.underline}**

We saw in Part 2 that the only sustained argument which Ord makes in
favor of climate risk is his discussion of unknown mechanisms in the
context of paleoclimate. But, if Halstead is right to suggest that the
paleoclimate data gives us every reason for confidence in humanity's
survival, then we should not have much confidence in Ord's argument.

### AT: Warming ! Defense --- 1AR

**No runaway warming or feedback loops**

**Thorstad 23**, PhD, Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Vanderbilt
University. (David, 1-28-2023, \"Exaggerating the risks (Part 4:
Halstead continued),\" Reflective altruism,

4\. Tipping points

Climate tipping points, from Lenton et al. (2019)

As the world warms, we will begin to approach tipping points,
large-scale climate discontinuities that could lead to major increases
in total warming (Lenton et al. 2019). **[Could tipping points put us on
an irreversible course towards existential catastrophe by
2100?]{.underline}**

**[The first thing to say is that, as with the paleoclimate, tipping
points need to be contextualized within our understanding of specific
mechanisms, such as sea level rise, heat stress and crop failure, by
which climate change could lead to existential catastrophe. We have seen
that [even the most outlandish warming scenarios do not pose a]{.mark}
credible [threat of existential catastrophe]{.mark} through any of these
mechanisms. So even if tipping points raise the probability of extreme
warming, it is not clear that they provide a new and credible pathway
towards existential catastrophe.]{.underline}**

More to the point, Halstead reviews each of the proposed tipping points
in the diagram above and argues in detail that none of these tipping
points presents a credible threat of human extinction. I will review a
few representative examples below. (Interested readers are invited to
consult Chapter 8 of the Halstead report).

Begin with dieback of the Amazon rainforest in the tropics and boreal
forests near the arctic. Both forests play an important role in trapping
carbon, preventing it from reaching the atmosphere.

Halstead suggests (plausibly) that boreal forest **[[dieback is]{.mark}
likely to be something of [a wash]{.mark}. As the world warms, the
southernmost reaches of boreal forests will become too warm to support
existing forests. But at the same time, boreal [forests will expand
north]{.mark}wards into land that was previously too cold to support
them. For this reason, boreal forest dieback is not expected to pose a
significant existential threat anytime soon.]{.underline}**

**[Amazon rainforest dieback is a bit more concerning. Indeed, Halstead
suggests, there is a good chance that human-caused deforestation will
continue to devastate the Amazon rainforest alongside the destruction
caused by climate change. However, Halstead reminds us, most [tropical
forests fluorished during the Eocene]{.mark} period, in which periods
were more than [10°]{.mark}C [hotter]{.mark} than they are today. So
there is no ready inference from present-day warming to a catastrophic
collapse of the Amazon rainforest.]{.underline}**

**[As Halstead reminds us, the IPCC's latest assessment report estimates
that even on pessimistic warming scenarios (4°C warming combined with
some pessimistic modeling assumptions), Amazon dieback is expected to
contribute about 0.3°C of additional warming. A catastrophe? Yes. But an
existential catastrophe? Certainly not.]{.underline}**

**[What about arctic permafrost? A great deal of carbon is currently
trapped in the arctic permafrost, and as the world warms, permafrost
will gradually melt, releasing carbon into the atmosphere. At Halstead
reminds us, the IPCC currently projects that each 1°C of warming will
lead to 18 gigatons of carbon (GtC) released from arctic
[permafrost]{.mark}. That [is]{.mark} roughly [two percent of the
amount]{.mark} projected [to be released by 2100]{.mark}]{.underline}**
on a middle-of-the-road scenario (RCP 4.5) by the IPCC. As before, this
is a regrettable catastrophe, but hardly an existential threat.

What about the most speculative scenarios? A rather controversial paper
by Will Steffen and colleagues, "Trajectories of the earth system in the
Anthropocene" predicts that once we reach 2°C of warming, the world will
enter a \`Hothouse Earth' phase, in which even with little additional
use of fossil fuels, cumulative warming will reach 6°C above
preindustrial levels.

Hothouse earth, Steffen et al. (2018)

At the risk of beating a very dead horse, the first thing to say about
**[[this]{.mark} scenario is that it [still would not kill]{.mark} us.
We have reviewed almost every plausible direct mechanism (heat stress,
crop failure, sea level rise, ...) by which warming could lead to
existential catastrophe. And we have seen that none of these mechanisms
plausibly threatens anything like existential catastrophe even under the
extreme assumption of 6°C warming.]{.underline}**

**[More to the point, \`[Hothouse Earth' is]{.mark} rather
[speculative]{.mark} science, and media coverage has stretched its
conclusions far beyond those initial speculations. The model itself is
highly uncertain and presents options for avoiding catastrophe. Here is
Richard Bettes, Professor of Climate Impacts at the University of
Exeter:]{.underline}**

**[With some exceptions, much of the highest-profile coverage of the
essay presents the scenario as definite and imminent. The impression is
given that 2°C is a definite "point of no return", and that beyond that
the "hothouse" scenario will rapidly arrive. Many articles ignore the
caveats that the 2°C threshold is extremely uncertain, and that even if
it were correct, the [extreme conditions would not occur for]{.mark}
centuries or [millennia]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Richard Betts, "Hothouse earth: Here's what the science actually says"

And what exactly is the research-backed case behind \`Hothouse Earth'?
Here things get a bit hairy, because as Betts reminds us, Steffen et al.
(2018) is an opinion piece, not a standalone research paper, and as such
it really doesn't do the kind of modeling that would be needed to
advance its thesis to the realm of serious credibility.

One thing that strikes me about the scientific literature on "tipping
points" is that there are a lot of review papers like this that end up
citing the same studies and each other ... There is a great deal of
interesting, insightful research going on using theoretical methods and
calculations with large approximations. However, we have yet to see an
equivalent level of research in the highly-complex Earth System Models
which generate the kind of detailed climate projections used for
addressing policy-relevant questions by the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC). Steffen and colleagues have made a good start at
addressing such questions, going as far as they can on the basis of the
existing literature, but their essay should motivate new research to
help narrow down the huge uncertainties. This will help us see better
whether "Hothouse Earth" is our destiny, or mere speculation.

Richard Betts, "Hothouse earth: Here's what the science actually says"

At the risk of piling on, Halstead adds another objection to the mix --
Steffen and colleagues seem to have forgotten to argue for the main
conclusion of their paper: that climate feedbacks could generate six
degrees of warming. Halstead collects together **[[all]{.mark} of the
[feedback]{.mark} effect[s]{.mark} mentioned by Steffen and colleagues
in the main text:]{.underline}**

**[Source: Steffen et al. (2018) via Halstead]{.underline}**

**[The problem? These [add up to]{.mark} a mere 0[.47]{.mark}°C of

warming, Steffen and [colleagues need to find an additional
3.5]{.mark}3[°]{.mark}C of warming]{.underline}** after 2100 due to
feedback effects.

Steffen and colleagues certainly claim that this additional warming will
occur. But they are not terribly precise about the details. As Halstead
puts it: "they do not explain what might cause the remaining 3.5°C of
warming over millennia implied by their Figure 1".

**[This sort of speculative modeling can be a good impetus for future
work, but it should not be taken as a scientifically respectable ground
for alarmist predictions of the likelihood of impending existential

### Relations don't solve warming --- 2AC

#### Relations don't solve climate change --- Russia isn't serious about tackling climate change and Trump thumps

While **[[Trump]{.mark}'s administration has [seriously damaged
America's image globally in the climate change
debate]{.mark}]{.underline}**, Joe Biden's rejoining the Paris Agreement
earlier this year and his serious commitments have put the US back on
track. This should come as great news to the Kremlin's climate team, but
only if the Kremlin proves ready to sincerely cooperate. Yet,
celebrating the "return of climate diplomacy" is premature. United
**[[Russia's satellites]{.underline}]{.mark}** posing as Green parties
hijack the platform for necessary environmental agenda in the country
and **[[prevent genuine environmental movements from gaining
momentum.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

The latest environmental strategy by the Kremlin depends heavily on
forests to absorb greenhouse gas emissions but neglects to account for
the rise in forest fires. On the contrary, the strategy saw carbon
emissions rise to 2.29 billion tons by 2050 with increases in almost all
economic sectors apart from electricity generation and utilities.
Comparably, in 2019, Russia's carbon emissions accounted to 2.12 billion
tons.

One huge difference in Russia's attitude towards climate change has been
its securitization. The newly updated Russian national security strategy
mentions climate change nine times in terms of prevention and
adaptation, which is a considerable change compared to 2015, when
climate change was mentioned only in passing and in terms of
consequences. While acknowledging the issue and committing to state
action might be greeted as good news, one should be wary of optimism. In
the past, the Kremlin has been eager to accuse the West of politicizing
climate change as a tool that would prevent Russian development in the
Arctic. Its current Arctic plan envisions numerous possibilities for
international cooperation, especially on science and technology, and its
realization could be a step towards stronger US-Russia cooperation.

Apart from this plan, however, **[[Russia has been giving conflicting
signs of its readiness for cooperation and its seriousness to curb
emission and tackle climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}**. While
meetings between the US Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry and
his Russian counterpart Ruslan Edelgeriyev are a start, they could also
easily turn into PR decoys. In May, the Kremlin announced a \$10 billion
plan to expand its railroad infrastructure and export coal to Asia, with
Russia's Energy Ministry projecting an increase of over 40% in coal
exports in their "optimistic" scenario. If this "optimistic" scenario is
fulfilled, Russia's coal export to Asia alone would be responsible for
over 700 million tons of carbon emissions by 2035, most likely
**[[rendering Russia's Paris Agreement pledge
void]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Such **[[short-term plans deter Russia from becoming]{.mark} the world's
[hub for renewables in the long run.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Russia has
the largest potential capacity in the world to generate wind and solar
power, but they only account to 0.2% of Russia's electricity today,
compared to US's 12%, China's 9.8%, and the EU's 21.4%. Avoiding this
potential, Russia not only will experience increased environmental
catastrophes, but also will completely pass on the opportunity to
compete in manufacturing and exporting "Green" technology -- a race that
China has been winning lately.

Unless the Kremlin seriously reconsiders its climate 'adaptation'
strategy, politicizing climate challenges, and aggressive coal exports,
Russia risks passing on the current US administration's readiness to
seriously cooperate on climate change issues. It also faces the risk of
facing more environmental catastrophes like the Norilsk oil spill, and
Putin risks seeing cronies like Potanin leave his orbit. Until the
Kremlin grasps the real security challenges, Green parties in **[[Russia
and the promise of real environmental platforms]{.mark} will [remain
just a façade]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Finally, overlooking renewables
now would be costly in the long run, as losing the race for "Green"
technology would expose Russia to paying higher costs when it finally
decides to use its solar and wind potential in the future.

industry that delivers late-breaking news, analysis and research that
travel professionals need to succeed., 2025 ("Middle East conflict adds
to the global airspace squeeze," July 7,

Accessed: 7/10/25)

**[[Instability in the Middle East and Eastern Europe has ratcheted up
route challenges for global air carriers]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

**[[And]{.underline}]{.mark}** [despite the cessation of bombing over
Iran in late June, the puzzle faced by many airline operations
teams]{.underline} **[[isn\'t likely to get easier
soon.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

For now, most **[[airlines are continuing to steer clear of Iranian
airspace]{.underline}]{.mark}**, altering routes to fly north through
Turkey or south through Saudi Arabia and Egypt. The diversions have
placed additional pressure on flight corridors that were already more
crowded due to the closure of Ukrainian airspace in 2022 and the
shutdown of Russian airspace for Western carriers.

Faced with limited choices, airlines are often forced to fly longer
routes, and with less scheduling flexibility, due to the challenges of
dealing with more crowded skies.

\"If you\'re thinking about a six-lane highway, we are basically now
funneling all traffic through two and three lanes,\" said Keith Glatz,
senior vice president of international affairs for Airlines for America
(A4A).

For U.S. carriers, the restrictions on Iran preceded the closures over
Russia and Ukraine, dating back to January 2020, when tensions escalated
in the aftermath of the U.S. assassination of Iranian general Qasem
Soleimani.

**[[U.S. airlines have]{.mark} also [chosen not to fly over
Iraq]{.mark}]{.underline}**, though the FAA allows it as long as an
altitude of 32,000 feet is maintained.

Currently, the flight risk database Safe Airspace advises against flying
over Iran, Israel, Syria and Lebanon along with Russia, Ukraine and
several other countries.

Cumulatively, the closures have mostly impacted India and China routes
for U.S. airlines. To and from China, the closure of Russian airspace
can increase flight time by two hours, depending on the route and on
conditions, as carriers stay south of their usual transpacific routing.

The Russian closure, augmented by the Iran closure, has caused U.S.
airlines to mostly stay out of the Indian market. United has canceled
three of its four India routes since 2022. And the only U.S. airline
routes to India are one each from American and United \-- to Delhi from
New York JFK and Newark, respectively.

Due to the closures, American operates JFK-Delhi by going across Turkey,
then staying north of Iran and Afghanistan before cutting sharply south
toward the Indian subcontinent, data from the flight-tracking service
AirNav Radar shows. In contrast, until India\'s flare-up with Pakistan
over the disputed Kashmir region in early May closed Pakistani airspace
to Indian carriers, Air India was able to fly the preferred polar route
over northern Scandinavia and Greenland, often saving 30 minutes to an
hour, depending on trade winds.

The Pakistani closure, however, first led Air India to adjust its
routing to go over Iran. Then came the bombing campaign by Israel, and
later the U.S., against Iran. Now Air India is operating its U.S.
service through the crowded Saudi Arabia/Egypt flight corridor, where it
shares the skies with East/West services from European and Gulf
airlines. Another popular Iran-avoidant corridor for non-U.S. operators
has them cutting north/south over eastern Iraq in transit between Turkey
and the Persian Gulf.

\"When you funnel a lot of traffic through a small corridor, that can
create a bunch of air traffic management challenges,\" said industry
analyst Bob Mann of R.W. Mann & Co.

One impact, he noted, is that airlines might not have the option to
substantially vary their routes to find the best wind conditions.

\"To have to fly the same corridor in both directions can create quite a
bit of operational penalty,\" Mann said.

Headwinds on alternate routes

Slower airline throughput is another pitfall, as Glatz\'s reference to
traffic highway lanes illustrates. He said airlines can try to fly
bigger planes with fewer frequencies to alleviate that problem. But no
matter what, scheduling challenges are heightened.

Longer flight times also increase fuel usage and up the difficulty of
crew scheduling, especially if delays cause more frequent occurrences of
crews being timed out due to regulations on crew duty duration.

And all of these issues, said Mann, impact the economics of each route,
making some routes less appealing, if not unviable.

\"Some of it you try, but the cost of it is so high in equipment
utilization and fuel burn and staffing utilization that you cancel that
stuff,\" he said.

Despite all the problems caused by airspace closures, many airlines
might not be quick to return to the skies over Iran. In a recent opinion
published by IATA, the trade group\'s senior vice president for
security, Nick Careen, pointed to the downing of Ukrainian Airlines
Flight PS752 by Iran in 2020 and last December\'s downing of Azerbaijan
Airlines Flight 8243 by what is believed to have been a Russian missile.

That second incident, he said, \"was a fresh reminder that **[[the risks

"NASA, Roscosmos and our other international partners remain focused on
the continued safe and professional operation of the International Space
Station in low-Earth orbit," a NASA spokesperson tells *Scientific
American*. "International Space Station cooperation continues smoothly,
as it has throughout the continuous presence of our joint crews for
nearly 25 years." Even so, **[this [partnership has an expiration
date]{.mark}]{.underline}**: **[[NASA's]{.mark} current [plan is for the
ISS to be abandoned]{.mark} and deorbited [by
2031]{.mark}.]{.underline}** And **[[apart from the
ISS]{.underline}]{.mark}**, these days, **[[the two countries have
minimal collaboration on space]{.mark} science and
exploration]{.underline}**.

For instance, **[[Russia has been]{.mark} conspicuously [absent
from]{.mark} the long-simmering U[.S. efforts to return astronauts to
the moon]{.mark}]{.underline}** via NASA's Artemis program. **[Instead
[Roscosmos is pursuing an independent plan]{.mark}]{.underline}** [for
robotic and crewed lunar exploration, and]{.underline} **[[in 2021 it
announced a partnership with China]{.underline}]{.mark}** to construct a
crewed moon base. Although neither Russia nor China have been especially
forthcoming about the finer details and status of such plans, recent
statements from Gennady Krasnikov, president of the Russian Academy of
Sciences (RAS), during a general meeting of RAS members at the end of
May suggest that Russia is attempting to accelerate its lunar program,
which will unfold across multiple missions.

"As for the lunar program, it includes seven lunar missions with various
scientific objectives," Krasnikov said. "At the first stage of the
study, our research works will be based on automatic flights." Some, if
not all, of these missions will target the moon's north and south poles,
where significant deposits of water ice have been discovered. "We also
plan to send lunar rovers to study the area and prepare for the
placement of a future lunar station," Krasnikov said. "This is a large
and very important program and, of course, a serious challenge for our
academic institutions."

Lev **[[Zelenyi]{.underline}]{.mark}**, chief research officer of the
Space Research Institute, the leading organization within RAS on space
exploration, tells *Scientific American* he **[[has modest hopes for
deeper cooperation]{.mark} between the U.S. and Russia [in the space
sector]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

"Naturally, I see potential and hope that it will be realized in
something concrete---although it is difficult to say what it will be
yet," Zelenyi says. "However, **[in the case of [the Russian lunar
program]{.mark}, it [is going its own way,]{.mark} [and I do not see
great prospects for cooperation here]{.mark}]{.underline}**."

One potential area ripe for partnership, he adds, is Venus---a world
that only the Soviet-era Russian space program has ever managed to land
on. It remains a tempting destination for Russia's modern-day
interplanetary probes. Bakanov, for example, treats Russia's return
there as a foregone conclusion. In a recent Telegram post, he declared,
"We will explore Venus; we are the only country that has landed a device
on it."

"It seems promising to me to resume cooperation in Venus exploration
programs," Zelenyi says. "Both Russia and the United States have great
interest in this planet and have serious programs for its study. In my
opinion, a meeting of Russian and American scientists to discuss all
these issues would be useful. It could be held under the auspices of our
\[respective\] academies of sciences, as both have their own space
councils."

Still, **[[despite]{.mark} such measured [optimism]{.mark}, independent
[analysts of Russia's space activities believe it will be difficult for
the nation to resume]{.mark} large-scale [cooperation with the
U.S.]{.mark} in this domain]{.underline}**. In the case of Venus, one
obstacle is that **[[the White House has signaled it has other
priorities for NASA]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For instance, **[it has
proposed to cancel the space agency's two planned Venus-focused
missions, and to eliminate NASA's involvement in
Envision]{.underline}**, a Venus mission led by the European Space
Agency (ESA). More **[[broadly, Russia's war in Ukraine remains the
chief stumbling block]{.mark}---not only [because of the backlash it
fostered from the U.S.]{.mark} and European allies but also because [the
war effort has strained Russia's coffers and distracted its
scientific]{.mark} and technical [workforce]{.mark}. All this has
contributed to recent financial cuts and technical delays for Russia's
space program.]{.underline}**

In the years ahead, the ports of the Northern Sea Route could become

### Appeasing Russia Bad --- 1AR

**Appeasing Russia guarantees [nuclear war]{.underline} and [wildfire
proliferation]{.underline} globally.**

**Shalom 22** --- Dr. Stephen R. Shalom has a PhD in Political Science
from Boston University, professor of political science at William
Paterson University, 2022 (\"Ukraine and the Dangers of Nuclear War,\"
[[https://newpol.org/ukraine-and-the-dangers-of-nuclear-war/]{.underline}](https://newpol.org/ukraine-and-the-dangers-of-nuclear-war/))

**[The problem with [succumbing to Putin's demands is]{.mark} that doing
so is [not]{.mark} necessarily [the best way to]{.mark}
[minimize]{.mark} the dangers of [nuclear war]{.mark}. Because a
rational leader would not undertake a policy whose costs outweighed the
benefits, sometimes leaders bluff, feigning that they are willing to
face costs far greater than warranted in order to intimidate their
adversaries into surrender. Surrender here, however, can increase the
prospects of nuclear war going forward.]{.underline}**

One of the foremost advocates of this nuclear bluffing strategy was
Richard Nixon. As he explained his approach to his White House chief of
staff H. R. Haldeman, I call it the Madman Theory, Bob. I want the North
Vietnamese to believe I've reached the point where I might do anything
to stop the war. We'll just slip the word to them that, 'for God's sake,
you know Nixon is obsessed about Communism. We can't restrain him when
he's angry --- and he has his hand on the nuclear button' and Ho Chi
Minh himself will be in Paris in two days begging for peace.

Nixon and his national security adviser Henry Kissinger tried to carry
out this strategy in October 1969, hoping to frighten the Soviet Union
into pressing North Vietnam to accept American terms. On October 6,
Kissinger ordered the secretary of defense to conduct a "series of
increased alert measures designed to convey to the Soviets an increasing
readiness by U.S. strategic forces." The next week, the Strategic Air
Command put on alert 176 bombers and 189 refueling tankers. Nixon met
with the Soviet ambassador, displaying, according to an impressed
Kissinger, the "guts of a riverboat gambler." On October 26, the
Strategic Air Command flew six armed B-52 bombers over Alaska. But,
despite the intimidation, Moscow did not compel Hanoi to surrender --
and (fortunately) nor did Soviet leaders panic and launch a preemptive
strike on the United States.

The political science literature shows that the madman strategy
generally doesn't work. The biggest problem with the strategy is, in the
words of Stephen Walt, an advocate of realism in international
relations:

When other states deal with a powerful but unpredictable leader, they
may tread carefully but they aren't going to make big concessions. After
all, if a madman is dangerous now, doing anything that makes them more
powerful just makes them more dangerous later. [Appeasement is sometimes
a smart diplomatic strategy, but only if one believes that making
concessions will **remove grievances**, reduce **suspicions**, make the
other side more **benign**, and allow mutually beneficial relations to
emerge]{.underline}.

Imagine what would happen if Washington responded to Putin's nuclear
bluster by stopping its weapons supplies to Ukraine or lifting its
sanctions.

The Kremlin, now with a proven method of getting its way, could then
demand surrender from Georgia and Moldova, two former Soviet republics
where Russian troops currently hold contested territory. And when the
United States and NATO refused to provide arms to these governments
(because, after all, one doesn't want to risk nuclear war), the two
countries would have little option but to submit. But why stop there? If
Russia then demanded (with appropriate rhetoric and missile tests) that
NATO troops be removed from the Baltic states, would it be worth risking
madman Putin escalating to nuclear war? So best comply. And if it then
further demanded that no NATO arms be provided to these former
components of the Soviet Union, again, why provoke the Bear? But [at
some point]{.underline}, [either Moscow or Washington will
miscalculate]{.underline} -- [will NATO back down? is Russia
bluffing]{.underline}? --- [and we'll be in the **midst** of a **nuclear
war.**]{.underline}

And Putin wouldn't be the only one to try to take advantage of this
strategy. [Would **[his success]{.mark}** [encourage other nuclear
bullies]{.mark}]{.underline}? [Might **[Israel]{.mark}**]{.underline}
then [make **demands** of Iran, to which Tehran would have to give in
lest it **face** **Armageddon**]{.underline}? [Might **[China]{.mark}**
demand that the United States stop]{.underline} [arming]{.underline} and
even trading with **[Taiwan]{.underline}**, [facilitating a bloodless
conquest?]{.underline} [Might **[North Korea]{.mark}** demand that South
Korea and Japan subsidize its economy?]{.underline}

But [[giving in]{.mark} to Putin's threats wouldn't only encourage
**continuing acts of nuclear extortion**]{.underline}. [It]{.underline}
[[would]{.mark} also **[provoke]{.mark}** the potential [victims]{.mark}
of this **extortion** [to rush to **acquire** **nuclear arms**]{.mark}
of their own as a means of self-protection]{.underline}. [**[South
Korea]{.underline}**, **[Taiwan]{.underline}**, **[Japan]{.underline}**,
**[Iran]{.underline}**, **[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**]{.mark},
**[UAE]{.underline}**, **[Qatar]{.underline}**, **[Egypt]{.underline}**,
[[and others]{.mark} [would]{.mark} **inevitably** [**seek**]{.mark} to
become **nuclear weapons states**]{.underline} (if they are not already
doing so). Some experts have claimed that widespread nuclear
proliferation would be great, because no one would ever go to war again,
fearing nuclear retaliation. But as most analysts understand, **[[the
risks of accidental]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[inadvertent]{.underline}**, [or]{.underline}
**[escalatory]{.underline}** [[war]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[or]{.underline} **[terrorism]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [or]{.underline}
**[sabotage]{.underline}** [[increases **exponentially**]{.mark} with
the number of **nuclear weapons states.**]{.underline}

To be sure, [the historical record suggests that nuclear arms have not
been very successful as a coercive tool]{.underline}. (Consider that
possession of nuclear weapons didn't allow the United States to prevail
in Vietnam or the Soviet Union in Afghanistan.) But if nuclear threats
gave the Russians a victory in Ukraine (for that's what a cut-off of
Western military supplies would mean), the calculus would change
dramatically. Nuclear weapons expert Todd Sechser has observed: Russia
has given us a vivid reminder that [nuclear weapons are not a magic
wand]{.underline}. As the war began, Vladimir [Putin]{.underline} made
several nuclear threats -- both explicit and implied. But [the fear of
nuclear escalation has not **intimidated** **Ukraine** into
**submission**]{.underline}. [Nor have these threats]{.underline}
[dissuaded the West from]{.underline} imposing crippling sanctions on
Russia and [providing military aid to Ukraine]{.underline}. If anything,
Putin's nuclear bellicosity has only fueled the international backlash
against Russia. The war has thrown a spotlight on the political limits
of nuclear weapons, and dictators with nuclear ambitions should take
note.

If instead, NATO had given in or gives in to Putin's demands, the
lessons for leaders with nuclear ambitions would be rather different.

**[[Appeasement, then]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [has its
dangers]{.underline}, [setting off dynamics that might **increase**
rather than]{.underline} **[decrease]{.underline}** **[the risks of
nuclear war]{.underline}**. But military build-up and the logic of
deterrence have their dangers as well, as we know from many historical
examples. International relations scholars and peace researchers has
long identified the "security dilemma" as a major cause of war: when one
country takes steps to increase its own security that in turn decrease
the security of its adversaries, the resulting countermoves end up
reducing everyone's security. (The eastward expansion of NATO was a
classic example of this dynamic.) So [while it would make good **sense**
to call for the **scal**ing **back** of **aid** to Ukraine if there were
a **real danger** of nuclear war]{.underline}, **[[giving in to Russian
demands]{.mark} if [they were a bluff]{.mark} [might]{.mark} actually
[increase]{.mark} [the dangers of]{.mark} [nuclear
war]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

### Russia is a threat in the Arctic --- 2AC

**Russia is a threat in the Arctic -- increasing militarization now**

**[[The clock is ticking]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and the West is on thin
ice.

Just **[[how important the Arctic is to Russia in terms
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** maintaining its **[threatening [nuclear
posture]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[toward the U.S. [cannot be
overstated]{.mark}. In a nuclear exchange, [Moscow would]{.mark} likely
[fire]{.mark} long-range ballistic [missiles]{.mark}]{.underline}** ---
from ballistic missile submarine bases near the Kola Peninsula ---
**[through the poorly surveyed airspace [over
Greenland]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And **[[hindered by low
visibility]{.mark} in the Arctic]{.underline}**, **[[U.S. forces would
be ill-prepared to detect and counter the strike.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[Russia has been building up this Arctic force since]{.underline}**
its **[2014]{.underline}** invasion of Crimea. In its efforts, melting
sea ice has presented both opportunities and challenges for the country.
On the one hand, the economic importance of Russia's Arctic coastline is
growing because of its commercialization as a feasible shipping route,
allowing Moscow to profit from providing short shipping routes for
commercial vessels carrying cargo between Asia and Europe. However, more
traffic also means Russia's control of its vast Arctic coastline ---
stretching from the Barents Sea in the west to the Bering Strait in the
east --- is now threatened.

So, **[using a dense network of air defense, aviation and ground forces
at its Northern Fleet bases, [Russia]{.mark} has been focusing on
closing off access to the Kola Peninsula]{.underline}** at the Barents
Sea **[to protect its strategic submarine force and preserve the fleet's
year-round access to the Atlantic]{.underline}**. **[It has also
[invested]{.mark} heavily [in precision]{.mark}-guided [missile
tech]{.mark}nology to threaten distant targets and achieve sea denial
without having to deploy traditional naval or air forces.]{.underline}**

Additionally, **[in order to maintain and operate a strategic submarine
force near Alaska]{.underline}** without relying on Northern Fleet
repair facilities at the other end of Eurasia, **[[Russia has
constructed new hardened submarine shelter pens]{.mark}]{.underline}**
and repair and maintenance facilities south of the Bering Strait near
Vladivostok.

In fact, while Trump criticizes his predecessors for mishandling Russia,
he risks overlooking the lessons of previous U.S. administrations.
**[Those who believed that [normalizing relations]{.mark} and engaging
constructively with Moscow would [lead to peace]{.mark} were [proven
wrong]{.mark}. From George W. [Bush]{.mark} to Barack [Obama]{.mark},
[each]{.mark} administration [tried to reset]{.mark} relations with
Russia, only to see the [Kremlin escalate]{.mark}---[first b]{.mark}y
invading [Georgia]{.mark} in 2008 and [then]{.mark} annexing
[Crimea]{.mark} in 2014. By repeating this mistake, the [U.S]{.mark}.
may inadvertently [enable Russia]{.mark} [to achieve its]{.mark}
strategic [goals]{.mark}, [undermining]{.mark} the security of
[Europe]{.mark} [and the]{.mark} broader [international
order]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Putin's desire to speak directly to his U.S. counterparts reflects his
desire to return to a model of great-power politics, where the United
States and Russia can negotiate as equals and agree on spheres of
influence. **[[Putin]{.mark} [sees]{.mark} [Russia as a global power
with a]{.mark} [legitimate right]{.mark} [to dominate the
post-Soviet]{.mark} [space]{.mark}, which he views as [part of
Russia's]{.mark} [rightful]{.mark} [sphere of
influence]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[Similarly, Trump has shown signs of an expansionist mindset, aiming
to assert U.S. dominance through both military and economic power. He
has suggested using military force to secure control over the Panama
Canal and Greenland, as well as using economic coercion to gain control
of Canada. While the Trump administration risks putting the future of
trans-Atlantic relations to the test, [Russia sees an opportunity to
exploit divisions within the West.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[Finally, with its [attacks on Ukraine]{.mark}, Russia has [officially
debunked the]{.mark} oft-repeated [narrative]{.mark} that [its]{.mark}
economic [interests]{.mark} guarantee its participation [in
preserving]{.mark} regional [peace]{.mark} and stability. [Moscow has
long harbored grand designs of developing its]{.mark} vast [Arctic
coastline]{.mark} and extracting more of the resources found off them.
As a result, many believed it would have an interest in maintaining
peace and stability in the Arctic, so that it could attract foreign
investment to these projects and increase cargo traffic in the Northern
Sea Route. But [it's hard]{.mark} to believe in this logic, or [to take
comfort in reports of Russia's]{.mark} relatively [restrained
conduct]{.mark} in the Arctic, at a time [when its government has
substantially increased its military assets]{.mark} in the region
[and]{.mark} when Russian President Vladimir [Putin is openly
threatening war]{.mark} if other states cross his red
lines.]{.underline}**

The West's unease on these points can be seen clearly in its
surprisingly robust and united effort to pull the plug on the Russian
economy by imposing coordinated sanctions on its key sectors. However,
Western leaders will also need to grapple with another dimension of
great-power politics as they attempt to isolate Moscow: the
inevitability of greater Chinese presence in the Arctic, and, more
broadly, the presence of other non-Arctic states.

As Western capital and technologies depart from Russia's energy sector,
**[Moscow will be more prone to cooperate with Beijing on developing its
Arctic resources, an outcome that would further complicate Arctic
governance]{.underline}** by directly exposing it to the dynamics of the
U.S.-China great-power rivalry. And if Beijing increases its commercial
stakes in the Arctic, that would also make it harder for the U.S. to
denounce China's once-ridiculed narrative that it is a "near-Arctic"
state that should be included in any regional agenda-setting
initiatives.
