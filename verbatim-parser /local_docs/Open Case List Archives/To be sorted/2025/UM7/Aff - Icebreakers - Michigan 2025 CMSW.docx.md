Most scholars writing in the post-Cold War era rejoiced over
geopolitical stability and constructive cooperation in the Arctic,
defined by what they called "Arctic exceptionalism",1) which can be
characterized by the absence of the great power competition in the
region, and a supposed position outside of the reach of the traditional
realist perspective. [However, the [rise of China]{.mark} and its
unprecedented claims in the Arctic, as well as its self-declared status
of being the near-Arctic state; [Russian militarization of the Arctic
water]{.mark}s; increasing [convergence between Russia and
China]{.mark}; geopolitical tensions between Russia and the United
States; [and the **global rivalry** between the United States and
China]{.mark} are [all entangling the Arctic in]{.mark} a **renewed
[great power competition]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

In his maiden speech at the biennial ministerial meeting of the Arctic
Council held in Rovaniemi, Finland[, US Secretary of State Michael R.
Pompeo called [the Arctic **"an arena of global power and
competition".**]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}In 2018, [[China]{.mark}
released its first white paper]{.underline} on the Arctic strategy,
[self-[declared itself as the "near-Arctic state]{.mark}" and unveiled
the ambitious "Polar Silk Road" component of its grandiose Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI). Russia is strengthening its military and commercial
presence in the Arctic]{.underline} by developing new military and naval
bases, refurbishing the old ones[, and expanding its already populated
fleet of Nuclear-powered icebreakers and submarines. The [**race to
conquer resources** in the]{.mark} world's **"[final frontier"]{.mark}**
[has **already begun**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

From the neorealist perspective, the [conventional [security of the
Arctic]{.mark} is a [function of how]{.mark} the [great powers will
interact with each other]{.mark} and how great power rivalries will
unfold.]{.underline} This article defines the traditional security of
the Arctic as a combination of three intersecting realities: First,
shifting balance of power towards China at both global and regional
(Arctic) level. Second, increasing Cold War rivalries between the United
States and Russia. Third, growing strategic convergence between Russia
and China. Using a neorealist framework [, this article assumes that the
[security and prosperity of other Arctic nations]{.mark} are
[**intertwined** with global security]{.mark} developments]{.underline},
for the simple reason best summed up in the ancient Greek dictum, "the
strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must". It is
wishful to think that cooperation can be woven around issues like
environmental degradation, climate change, and sustainable development
when the great powers are setting up camp in the region. [[Great power
rivalries]{.mark} are [governed]{.mark} not by cooperation, but
[by]{.mark} the dynamics of [the security dilemma]{.mark}.]{.underline}
In the realm of global anarchy, which is defined by the absence of
international government, no one can trust anyone. Relative military and
economic gains matter, not the absolute ones. [Increasingly, [realists
have started to declare the **demise of Arctic exceptionalism**]{.mark}.
As Mathieu Boulègue writes, the time has now come **to puncture** the
myth of "**Arctic exceptionalism**".]{.underline}

Shifting Balance of Power: China's Rise and America's Decline

[The [global balance of power is shifting towards
China]{.mark}.]{.underline} The American share of the global trade and
GDP is declining. [[**America is receding**]{.mark} from its global
commitments and is turning inwards, and [China is increasingly
**challenging**]{.mark} the **[US hegemony]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
South China Sea is on the roll to become Chinese Sea6) China is getting
a stronghold of the major International Organizations. Beijing is fast
bridging the military gap with Washington and the world order is moving
towards a bipolar, or better labeled, nonpolar world. With the shift of
the strategic balance of power, China is getting both emboldened and
assertive at the same time.7)

[[China is a]{.mark} self-declared [near-Arctic state]{.mark} having
mildly **revisionist intentions**]{.underline}. As the economic,
military, and diplomatic standing of China has improved drastically over
the past two decades, the more confident and prosperous China is seeking
a louder international voice, not just in the Indo-Pacific but also in
other parts of the world. [Although it is highly [unlikely that China
will get into a military confrontation]{.mark} with the United
States,]{.underline} its salami-slicing techniques and debt-[trap
strategy are a cause of [**concern for the Arctic stability**]{.mark} in
large and the United States interests in particular.]{.underline}

Greenland and Iceland are the centers of a diplomatic tussle between the
United States and China. The American concerns about the Chinese
investments in the mineral resources of Greenland, geothermal energy in
Iceland, and a joint project with Finland to develop a 'data silk road',
are evident in its policy papers and diplomatic behavior. Greenland is a
case in point of the conflicting US and Chinese interests in the region.
Chinese attempt to buy a defunct naval base10) and eagerness to build a
new airport 11) in Nuuk, the capital city of Greenland, were taken by
such gravity in Washington that US Secretary of Defense James Mattis had
to jump12) in to pressurize Danish government to halt these initiatives
and allegedly the United States committed itself to these projects.
Further, the US administration lives in constant fear that Chinese
investments could embolden the economy of Greenland and could help
Greenland's pursuit of independence from Denmark. This will have a major
setback to the US security commitments in the region and especially to
its military base in Thule.

The Great Power rivalry, caused by the shift in the balance of power, is
intensified by the dynamics of a security dilemma―wherein attempts by
one state to enhance its security is perceived with strategic mistrust
by the other state, stimulating a negative spiral of deteriorating
relations leading to security tensions, arms race and military conflict
or war. As the great power rivalry between China and the United States
ripens, there are very high possibilities that the tensions, conflicts,
and competition arising in one part of the world will spill into other
regions. The Arctic remains vulnerable to these "strategic spillovers".

New Cold War in the Arctic

[The [Arctic Ocean was **highly militarized** during the Cold
War]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Soviet Union, as well as the United States
stationed nuclear deterrence on the Northern reaches of the Arctic. [The
[**strategic importance** of the **Arctic Ocean**]{.mark} is [qualified
b]{.mark}y the [**geographical proximity** between]{.mark} the [United
States and]{.mark} the USSR]{.underline} (now
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}) -- ballistic missiles could easily strike
the enemy by flying over the Arctic. [Further, the desolated and
unreachable spreads of the [Arctic North assured **second-strike nuclear
capabilities**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Some scholars argue that [**[Arctic
exceptionalism]{.mark} is [coming to an end]{.mark}** []{.mark}and the
security environment of the Arctic is entering into **a new Cold
War**]{.underline}.13) Others believe that security and nuclear
commitments in the region were never withdrawn and thus the old one
never ended.14)

If we don't take into account the dwindling figures of its economy,
Russia is a power that has always punched above its weight. The United
States and China might be structural competitors for global hegemony,
but [when it comes to the Arctic region, Russia is the undisputable
military and economic superpower. Russians have militarized the Arctic
at an expeditious pace.]{.underline} The [current Russian military
buildup]{.underline} in the Arctic is highly defensive, but its
[inherent offensive capabilities cannot be denied.]{.underline} In 2014,
Russia opened a new Unified Strategic Command, called "OSK Sever," to
strengthen the security of its vast Arctic borders and secure its Arctic
interests. The Kola Peninsula remains the crux of Russian military
establishment in the western Arctic, for securing its strategic
interests and for power projection capabilities in the Atlantic Ocean
and beyond. Russia claims to have built 475 new military sites,
including bases north of the Arctic Circle, as well as 16 new deep-water
ports. It secures this presence through sophisticated new air defense
systems and anti-ship missiles.

#### The US is lagging behind in icebreakers, which poses risks to our national security and Arctic presence.

NPR\'s Ayesha Rascoe asks retired U.S. naval officer Peter Rybski why
the Coast Guard has fallen behind on producing icebreakers and what that
means for U.S. influence in the Arctic.

AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:

[[Competition for control of the Arctic is heating up]{.mark}. Russia
and China recently carried out a joint patrol of the
region]{.underline} - a first, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. And
[[the U.S]{.mark}. might increasingly be [at a disadvantage because of a
shortage of]{.mark}]{.underline} ships needed to navigate the Arctic[,
[icebreakers]{.mark}.]{.underline} Peter Rybski is a retired U.S. naval
commander now living in Finland. He writes a substack called \"Sixty
Degrees North,\" focusing on national security and maritime issues.
Welcome to the program.

PETER RYBSKI: Thanks. It\'s great to be here, Ayesha.

RASCOE: Why are countries competing for influence in the Arctic and why
are icebreakers so key to that effort?

RYBSKI: Well, Ayesha, so [over the past two decades]{.underline} or so,
with the receding of the sea ice, particularly in the summer, [[you\'ve
had an increase in maritime traffic]{.mark} because the waters are
open]{.underline} and they\'re open for longer. And with that, you have
areas of the Arctic that are more open for oil, gas and mineral
exploration and fishing, whereas, maybe 20 years ago, you didn\'t have
so much maritime traffic off the coast of Alaska going through the
Bering Strait and around the U.S. These days, traffic is markedly
increased, and Russia\'s working hard exploring and bringing natural gas
to market through the Northern Sea route and through the Arctic to the
Far East.

RASCOE: Why are icebreakers, then, important? Is it because, even though
the ice is receding, the waters are still pretty kind of treacherous or
difficult to traverse?

RYBSKI: Yes, that\'s exactly it. [Just because there\'s more open ice
doesn\'t mean you don\'t have to break the ice through some of the
areas]{.underline} or, you know, keep the ice out of the way. Sort of
paradoxically, I mean, the more open ice you have, the more ships you
have. And then to keep those vessels safe and to get them through some
of the stickier parts, [**[you need more icebreakers]{.mark}** or
ice-capable vessels to do it.]{.underline}

RASCOE: Well, let me ask you about that because the subject of
icebreakers came up at a recent congressional hearing, and I gather that
the U.S. Coast Guard has just two in operation. Why does the U.S. Coast
Guard only have two, and how does that compare with Russia and China?

RYBSKI: That\'s right. At the moment, [the [U.S. C]{.mark}oast
[G]{.mark}uard has two polar-capable icebreakers.]{.underline} And
really, for quite a long time, up until this traffic really took off,
most of what the U.S. Coast Guard was doing with their icebreakers was
supporting scientific research missions. And for that, two vessels was
largely sufficient. [But they [realized]{.mark}]{.underline} that in
order to patrol all this area and to ensure that the Navy - should it
need to - have access to the Arctic or the Antarctic waters when
they\'re ice-covered, [[they would need]{.mark} to have **[eight or
nine]{.mark}** vessels.]{.underline} So they started a program to do so,
but it\'s not going so well. People often like to compare the numbers
because it\'s quite stark. I mean, [[Russia has]{.mark} -]{.underline}
depending on who you talk to and how you - where you draw the line on
what is an icebreaker - you know, [[40 to 55]{.mark} ice-capable vessels
that are operating.]{.underline} But realistically, they have a need to.
I mean, they use a northern sea route to move goods between their own
ports. So I don\'t think the numbers themselves tell the whole story.
Rather, it\'s can we do what we need to do and ensure that the Navy has
access should it need it?

RASCOE: So this summer, the U.S. did sign an agreement with Canada and
Finland to increase collaboration on building icebreakers. How
significant might that be, especially in terms of increasing the fleet
of icebreakers?

RYBSKI: I think it could be significant, but at this stage, it\'s too
early to tell. I know that the Finns think that they have the expertise
and the ability to help us acquire vessels. But right now, the
indications that I\'ve seen is that the U.S. Coast Guard wants to build
all of its icebreakers in the United States.

RASCOE: I guess, why is the U.S. industry struggling to do this?

RYBSKI: I think there are two reasons. First is that [we haven\'t built
an icebreaker in the U.S. - a heavy icebreaker - since the
1970s.]{.underline} And [they require a lot of special
metals]{.underline} because the hull has to be pretty strong, which
requires some welding techniques that our shipyards are struggling with
trying to learn. And basically, we just haven\'t done it in a while.

The second part is that the technology has changed. In the 1970s,
icebreakers - like, their ability to break ice was determined by two
things. There\'s the shape of their hull and how powerful their engines
were. But now modern icebreakers using something called azimuth
propulsion - they\'re just little pods that spin around. They can break
ice in a different manner that requires less engine power. And so we\'re
trying to build a modern icebreaker as well, something that hasn\'t been
done in the United States.

RASCOE: What might be the consequences if the U.S. doesn\'t increase its
presence in the Arctic?

RYBSKI: Well, at the rate we\'re headed, [one of our icebreakers
is]{.underline}, I mentioned, is [over 50 years old, and it spends half
of its time in drydock being repaired]{.underline} so it can support the
mission. So [[if we have a casualty]{.mark} or a mechanical problem,
[we\'ll have **no presence** in the Arctic]{.mark},]{.underline} which,
from a national security standpoint, means that [we can\'t be present
[to keep an eye on]{.mark} what [Russia or China]{.mark}]{.underline}
may be doing up there. And [[if we can\'t see]{.mark} it [and]{.mark} we
can\'t [patrol]{.mark} it, [then we **can\'t control our**]{.mark} **own
[waters]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

RASCOE: That\'s Peter Rybski, a retired U.S. naval commander. Thank you
so much for joining us.

RYBSKI: Thank you. Thank you very much.

#### Trump ruined our plans to collaborate through the ICE pact, and other factors make current icebreaker plans unattainable.

**Gould and Mcleary 25** \[Joe Gould, Defense Reporter at Politico, Paul
Mcleary, Pentagon and National Security Reporter, \"Trump looks to
shatter icebreaker pact with Canada, Finland,\" E&E News by POLITICO,

erin

President-elect [Donald [Trump]{.mark} on Tuesday [**threw a wrench in
U.S. plans** to build icebreaker vessels]{.mark} with Canada and
Finland,]{.underline} saying [[he told]{.mark} outgoing Canadian Prime
Minister Justin [Trudeau, "We don't need a
partner."]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The [remarks]{.mark}]{.underline}, at a freewheeling press conference
and part of a broader critique of Canada's reliance on the U.S.,
[[**immediately cast a shadow** on the future of]{.mark} the
[I]{.mark}cebreaker [C]{.mark}ollaboration [E]{.mark}ffort
Pact,]{.underline} which was first announced at the NATO summit in
Washington in July.

"I called him, Gov. Trudeau, I said, 'Listen, what would happen if we
didn't subsidize you?' Because we give them a lot of money, we help
them," [Trump said]{.underline}. "As an example, we're buying
icebreakers, and [Canada wants to join us in the buying of
icebreakers]{.underline}. I said, ['We don't really want to have a
partner in the buying of icebreakers. **We don't need a
partner.'"**]{.underline}

Trump also touched on security and trade relations, saying the U.S.
spends "hundreds of billions per year to protect" Canada.

Trump at one point suggested Canada ought to be a U.S. state but said he
was not considering military force to annex it.

"Economic force, because Canada and the United States, that would really
be something," Trump said. "You get rid of that artificially drawn line
and you take a look at what that looks like, and it would also be much
better for national security. Don't forget, we basically protect
Canada."

[The U.S. is pursuing Arctic and Polar icebreakers to boost its aging
fleet,]{.underline} which operates one heavy icebreaker, the Polar Star,
and a medium polar icebreaker, the Healy[. Russia, meanwhile, has dozens
of newer, more advanced ice-breaking ships, dominating sea
traffic.]{.underline} China's presence in the region is also alarming
the rest of the Arctic nation community.

With the idea of sharing supply chains to cut building and maintenance
costs for icebreakers, [the U.S., Canada and Finland agreed under the
ICE Pact to advance industrial cooperation and workforce development and
to find ways to invest in U.S. shipyards.]{.underline}

The initial plan involves building ships at Finland's Helsinki Shipyard
--- owned by Canada's Davie, which has produced half the world's
icebreakers --- before bringing production and jobs to the U.S. The
Coast Guard will also work with Louisiana-based Bollinger Shipyards to
produce the first two American-made heavy icebreakers to join the U.S.
fleet in decades.

A fleet mix analysis conducted by the Coast Guard last year determined
that the service would need a total of eight to nine polar icebreakers
to support Arctic and Antarctic missions. [But
[the C]{.mark}ongressional [B]{.mark}udget [O]{.mark}ffice [found the
cost of]{.mark} three planned [icebreakers]{.mark},]{.underline}
initially estimated at \$2.3 billion in 2019, [[has **risen**]{.mark}
**to approximately \$5.1 billion** --- excluding
maintenance]{.underline}.

At the same time, [[the Coast Guard has struggled]{.underline}]{.mark}
amid the U.S. shipbuilding industry's inexperience [[to finalize a
design]{.mark} for the Polar Security Cutter.]{.underline}

Finnish President Alexander [[Stubb]{.mark} said he [spoke with
Trump]{.mark} in November]{.underline}, and the two discussed the
icebreaker deal [[but nothing about **whether Trump supported
it**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

#### A Navy-Operated icebreaker fleet is [essential]{.underline} to preserving U.S power in the Arctic.

"Breaking the Naval Impasse on the U.S. Icebreaker Program",

[The Great Power **[Competition]{.mark} in the Arctic** [will be **won
with icebreakers**]{.mark}]{.underline}---highly specialized naval
vessels capable of slicing directly through polar ice that would crush
traditional ships and withstanding "storms that can ice over
superstructures until ships become so top-heavy they capsize."
Currently, complete [**[exploration]{.mark}**, shipping, and patrol of
the Arctic [is **impossible without them**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Yet,
[[there is a]{.mark} **stark [imbalance]{.mark}** among]{.underline} the
[Great Powers [in]{.mark} their **icebreaking
[capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [China]{.underline}]{.mark},
located 800 miles away from the Arctic at its closest point, operates
two existing icebreakers (with a third on the way) and [[is developing
**nuclear**]{.mark}**-powered [technology]{.mark}** for these
vessels]{.underline}. [[Russia has]{.mark} a fleet of
**[forty-six]{.mark} icebreakers**, [including]{.mark} **three
[nuclear-powered ships]{.mark}**]{.underline} for extended Arctic
patrols, [and has recently launched a new "class of combat
icebreakers]{.underline} with high-speed guns and launchers for
anti-ship and land-attack cruise missiles." [[Both]{.mark} Russia and
China have [centralized their]{.mark} icebreaker [programs
**under**]{.mark} **their [navies]{.mark}**[, underscoring]{.mark} their
view of [these **ships as military assets**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In contrast, [[America's]{.mark} **icebreaker [program]{.mark}** [is in
**disarray**. The U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}government
[[has]{.mark} only **[two]{.mark} operational
[icebreakers]{.mark}**]{.underline}---the decades-old Polar Star and the
Healy---and [[neither]{.mark} of them are [capable]{.mark} of
[year-round]{.mark} operations. [Plans to build a]{.mark} new
[fleet]{.mark} of six to nine icebreakers]{.underline}, through the
Polar Security Cutter (PSC) program, **[[are
faltering]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This joint venture between the Navy
and Coast Guard is vastly over budget and behind schedule, already
exceeding procurement cost by 39 percent, with the first delivery
expected in 2029---four years late. Unlike Russia and China, [[the U.S.
has no]{.mark} serious [plan to equip its]{.mark} developing
[icebreakers **with nuclear**]{.mark} **power**.]{.underline} Moreover,
while the Navy has some involvement in procurement and construction of
the icebreakers, [[the Coast Guard]{.mark} alone [is]{.mark}
[responsible for]{.mark} their [operations]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is
important because [the Navy is the U.S. military's forward-deployed,
combat-oriented force, while the Coast Guard is structured primarily for
homeland defense.]{.underline} This organizational divide means that
[[the]{.mark} purpose, posture, and **operational [reach]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} **America's [icebreakers]{.mark}** [are]{.mark}
**dangerously [mismatched]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}with those of
its primary adversaries in the Arctic.

The Need for a U.S. Navy Icebreaker Program

Accordingly, [[the U.S.]{.mark} Congress and the President [must]{.mark}
enact legislation [requir]{.mark}ing [the **Navy** to build]{.mark} and
operate [its own]{.mark} combat-oriented **icebreaker [program]{.mark}**
to secure]{.underline} our national interests in [the
Arctic]{.underline}. The Navy is unlikely to take on this role
voluntarily. In 2023, the former Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral
Michael Gilday, underscored this reluctance when he deflected questions
about icebreaker procurement to the Coast Guard, making it clear that he
did not view the program as the Navy\'s responsibility. Currently, the
Coast Guard is the only branch of the U.S. military legally tasked with
"develop\[ing\], establish\[ing\], maintain\[ing\], and operat\[ing\]
icebreaking facilities." Without a mandate, the Navy has shown no
intention to expand its footprint into the icebreaking business.
Notably, Gilday's 2022 Navigation Plan, which outlines the Navy's
strategic goals through 2045, does not even acknowledge the Arctic as a
major global maritime shipping route, nor does it identify potential
geographic choke points in the region. In 2020, then-Secretary of the
Navy, Kenneth Braithwaite, acknowledged the importance of icebreakers in
front of Congress, but stated that "it is not a mission that is central
to the United States Navy" and is one it "rel\[ies\] on the Coast Guard
to provide." However, [[leaving this]{.mark} critical [program]{.mark}
solely [with the Coast Guard]{.mark}---a service with **less than 10
percent** the Navy's size and budget---[neglects]{.mark} U.S.
**[strategic interests]{.mark}** in the Arctic.]{.underline}

U.S. presence in [[the Arctic requires a]{.mark} robust **[naval]{.mark}
combat [capability]{.mark}** []{.mark}which the [Coast Guard cannot
provide]{.mark}]{.underline} alone. In his 2001 commentary on the
differences between the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard, Professor Colin Gray
of the Naval War College identified three unique characteristics of the
Navy, all of which are implicated by the icebreaker program.

First, the Navy "takes its tune ... from control (even command) of the
high seas." This means the first duty of "the premier navy, is to
control sea lines of communication---to allow or deny access to the sea,
thence across it, and finally to the land, where humankind lives."
However, [without an active icebreaker presence in the
Arctic]{.underline}, [[the Navy is]{.mark} voluntarily denying itself
full access to the Arctic [leaving **gaps for** ]{.mark}**its
[adversaries]{.mark}**]{.underline}---namely [Russia and China,
**[to]{.mark} aggressively [expand]{.mark}** and militarize]{.underline}
their icebreaker presence.

Second, the Navy's commitment to "boldly go ... where great navies have
feared to sail" is undermined by its repudiation of icebreaking
operations. [[Failing to establish a]{.mark} **surface
[presence]{.mark}** [in the Arctic]{.mark} with icebreakers [could yield
an]{.mark} "asymmetric \[\] [equalizer" for
adversaries]{.mark},]{.underline} a risk that becomes more imminent
[[as]{.mark} polar ice melts and **[access]{.mark}** to the Arctic
**[increases]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Third, and most importantly, "the navy of a superpower that aspires to
protect commerce and international order globally has no responsible
choice other than to pursue excellence virtually wherever military
science takes it, however serendipitously." [Russia and China are
actively moving the **Great Power Competition** to the
**Arctic**]{.underline}: [[Russia is arming]{.mark} its [icebreakers
with]{.mark}]{.underline} anti-ship [weapons and]{.underline} **[cruise
[missiles]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [both nations are]{.underline}
regularly [patrolling the Arctic]{.underline} seas [with icebreakers,
[and]{.mark} heavily [investing in **nuclear tech**]{.mark}**nology**
for these vessels.]{.underline} While icebreakers are certainly
necessary for the Coast Guard's missions---including search and rescue,
navigation, environmental protection, interdiction, and ice
operations---[Russia and China have embraced icebreakers as dual-use
assets that]{.underline} squarely [address the Navy's
purpose]{.underline}. Moreover, the Navy and Air Force's existing
submarine and aircraft presence in the Arctic is inadequate for the
Great Power Competition. Submarines and aircraft alone cannot "clear a
path for critical shipping, respond to oil spills, or conduct maritime
safety and security boardings in the U.S. Arctic"---let alone accomplish
more strategic goals of sea control and power projection in the region.

Separately from the mission, Congress and [the President should also
require an independent Navy icebreaker program due to the Coast Guard's
**ongoing struggles** in procuring and constructing the
vessels]{.underline}. This summer, the United States recently signed the
ICE Pact with Finland and Canada to build seventy to ninety new
icebreakers over the next decade. While this agreement will help expand
America's icebreaker fleet, it relies on Finland---which can build a
polar-class vessel in two years at just 25 percent of the cost of in
America---to handle construction. [This outsourcing is, frankly, an
**embarrassment**]{.underline}. The poor outcomes in the PSC program may
stem in part from its joint structure: since the Coast Guard operates
the icebreakers, the PSC program lacks the Navy's full commitment. The
Navy hasn't fully leveraged its size, money, expertise and influence to
drive efficiency or accelerate progress of the program, while the Coast
Guard remains constrained by the Navy's budget authority. Furthermore,
each service can deflect blame onto the other in congressional oversight
hearings, complicating accountability for the program's setbacks.

#### Icebreakers are the barrier to US Arctic leadership and a more secure region.

Presence & International Appearances

Icebreakers are an interesting platform to study because there appears
to be something special about their place in the international
consciousness. [[When comparing]{.mark} strategic [competition in the
Arctic]{.mark}, the most [commonly-cited example is the U.S.']{.mark}
relatively [small number of icebreakers]{.mark}.]{.underline}65
Submarines, aircraft, and infrastructure all play vital roles in
establishing power projection capabilities in the Arctic. But all
receive far less attention than icebreakers do in the media and the
political realm.

This is [because [icebreakers are]{.mark} seen as [the **"bare
minimum"** for serious participation in the Arctic]{.mark}
region]{.underline}, argues one Arctic researcher in the Washington
area. Within the American policy community, icebreakers are seen as [the
ante to establishing a legitimate claim to the region.]{.underline}

Some, like one prominent member of a national security think tank in
Washington, argue icebreakers are simply unimportant from national
security and international relations perspectives. This analyst argues
that the U.S. national security schema is sufficiently supported by the
presence of submarines in the Arctic. [In interviews with members of the
USCG, however[, **"having presence**" was of the **highest
priority**]{.mark},]{.underline} more so than fully fulfilling statutory
missions. Shannon Jenkins of the USCG said that "it's to our favor to
start with presence" and build from there, indicating [the USCG views
presence as the foundational goal [to be accomplished by icebreaking
vessels]{.mark}]{.underline}. Mr. Jenkins acknowledged the presence of
several U.S. fast-attack (SSN) and guided-missile (SSGN) submarines
operated by the United States Navy as a U.S. military presence in the
Arctic but argued these assets, alone, were insufficient to represent an
American presence in the region. For the vast majority of the time,
submarines operate beneath the water and are invisible to both domestic
and international audiences. [He argued vessels capable of a constant
presence above the water were needed. "You have to show the
flag,"]{.underline} said Mr. Jenkins, ["[to **enforce**]{.mark} **your
own [sovereignty]{.mark}** [and **protect freedom of**]{.mark}
**[navigation]{.mark}."**]{.underline}

As demonstrated by China's rise as an Arctic state, appearances do
matter. [China]{.underline}, as a non-arctic state, [did not need
icebreakers.]{.underline} Rather[, China intentionally produced
them]{.underline} and intentionally deployed them to the Arctic [to
support its claim to being an Arctic state and signal to the
international community that it intended to associate itself with the
Arctic.]{.underline} In essence, [China recognized the symbolic power of
icebreakers and has been exploiting this]{.underline} power. For China,
icebreakers were an integral part of their overall strategy of Arctic
identification. It is one thing to declare oneself a near-Arctic state,
gain membership in the appropriate international bodies, and announce
plans for the construction of a Polar Silk Road.66 It is another to
utilize icebreakers to establish a presence in the Arctic to demonstrate
the capacity to follow through with these claims.

[The presence [argument holds for national security]{.mark}
matters]{.underline}. National security is largely a question of
perception. [[In]{.mark} geostrategic [competition with Russia,
the]{.mark} U.S.' northern maritime [region will be **more secure if the
Russians perceive them** to be so.]{.mark}]{.underline}

A marine presence in the Arctic extends beyond near-peer competition
defense purposes. In the international arena, there are three possible
classifications of the identity of the U.S. as an Arctic nation. The
first manner in which the U.S. could engage the Arctic is as an inactive
participant. Such engagement with the Arctic would entail behavior and
capabilities such as a lack of means to engage, access, and command the
Arctic. This would mean that, even if the U.S. desired to send civilian
and military personnel into the Arctic, they could not. This would
entail a lack of icebreaking capabilities among domestic naval forces.
It would also include a lack of internationally articulated intent to
engage, access, and command the Arctic.

The second manner in which the U.S. could engage with the Arctic is as
an active participant. Such engagement with the Arctic would involve
having the capabilities to access the Arctic, but not making the Arctic
a strategic priority. In this scenario, the U.S. would regularly engage
with international bodies designed to govern the Arctic but fail to lead
them.

The third manner in which the U.S. could engage with the Arctic is as a
leader. Such engagement would entail having the most or nearly the most
advanced and capable means of accessing and commanding the U.S.' Arctic
region. It would entail leadership in international Arctic governance
forums.

Currently, the U.S. is barely an active participant. While policymakers
have articulated the importance of the Arctic as a current and future
strategic domain[, the U.S. is sorely lacking in capabilities to access
and command the Arctic. The U.S.' icebreaker fleet is small and outdated
in comparison to the U.S.' near-peer competitors and most Arctic allied
states.]{.underline} The infrastructure to service commercial activity,
the needs of Arctic communities, and the demands of potential military
engagements in the Arctic is sorely lacking[. [If the U.S. is to be a
**leader in the Arctic**, it must invest in]{.underline}]{.mark} [Arctic
capabilities to,]{.underline} first, [demonstrate a commitment to the
region and]{.underline}, second, gain the ability to [perform basic
tasks in the region by [increasing icebreaking
capabilities.]{.mark}]{.underline}

How icebreakers are structured and marketed to the international
community matters, too. Governments make conscious decisions with
regards to the capabilities of each nation's icebreaker platform.
Governments can choose to militarize icebreakers or maintain them as
purely economic, scientific, and commercial platforms. Regardless of
capabilities, how a government speaks about an icebreaker largely
impacts how that platform is perceived by domestic and international
audiences. How governments navigate these two choices is largely
representative of the countries in the region.

Chinese icebreakers, for example, are portrayed by the Chinese as purely
scientific research vessels. They are non-militarized and the Chinese
government ensures the platforms are portrayed as such. Icebreakers,
according to the 2018 Chinese Arctic whitepaper, are built exclusively
"for scientific purposes."67 Chinese icebreakers are postured in this
way because Chinese goals in the region are for the most economic.

In contrast, [the next generation of American icebreakers is clearly and
intentionally defined as "warships"]{.underline} by the USCG [as [the
U.S. seeks to counter]{.mark} what it perceives to be [a **growing
Russian military threat**]{.mark} in the region. [Russia icebreakers
are]{.mark} very much [militarized]{.mark}]{.underline} and [the U.S.
seeks to respond to this posturing]{.underline} in both endowing its
next generation of icebreakers with combat capabilities and defining
them as warships.

#### [Now]{.underline} is [key]{.underline}\-\--the Arctic has become a [geopolitical hotspot]{.underline} since Ukraine.

Mikhail **Komin** and Joanna **Hosa 25**, visiting fellows for the
European Council on Foreign Relations, 5/27/25, "The bear beneath the
ice: Russia's ambitions in the Arctic",
https://ecfr.eu/publication/the-bear-beneath-the-ice-russias-ambitions-in-the-arctic/#top//WF

For a long time, European Arctic states were determined to see the
region as a "peaceful zone of cooperation[". [**Before 2022,** the main
Arctic issues]{.underline}]{.mark} for Europe [[were]{.mark} climate
change, [the environment]{.mark} and]{.underline} sustainable
[development]{.underline}. Also on the agenda were new economic
opportunities in shipping routes, energy reserves and rare minerals. But
these were not a priority.

[That **[era has ended]{.mark}**. The [Arctic is **no longer a
peripheral**]{.mark}]{.underline} [concern [for]{.underline}]{.mark}
European [[security]{.mark} and strategy]{.underline}---[[it
is]{.underline}]{.mark} rapidly becoming [[**a central theatre** in
the]{.underline}]{.mark} emerging **[[global
order]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Europe is caught between Russia, which
sees the Arctic as part of its broader confrontation with the West; and
the US, which under Trump is a more hostile and transactional Arctic
actor. Now [[Russia's]{.mark} **strategic
[interests]{.mark}**]{.underline} directly [[**challenge** the
EU's]{.underline}]{.mark} foreign policy [objectives in the
Arctic]{.underline}. [[Climate]{.mark} policy, [defence]{.mark} issues,
multilateral [governance and energy]{.mark} security]{.underline} [all
[**converge** in]{.underline}]{.mark} this **[[one
theatre]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Despite these shifts, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} EU's
[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} policy is based on a strategic document
that dates back to 2021. This focuses on developing a "peaceful,
sustainable, and prosperous Arctic" and prioritises environmental issues
and scientific cooperation over defenсe and protecting the security
interests of member states. [The lag]{.underline}, in turn, [hampers
Europeans' ability to respond to what [is]{.mark} **fast becoming** [a
**geopolitical hotspot**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Meanwhile, non-Arctic states, especially [[China]{.mark}, are **[seeking
a stake]{.mark}** in the region]{.underline} through partnerships [[with
Russia]{.mark} and]{.underline} long-term **[infrastructure
investments]{.underline}**. This is [part of a broader attempt led by
Russia [to shape an]{.mark} **alternative, [illiberal
Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline} order that stands [in direct contrast to
Europeans' vision]{.underline}. [[EU and NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}
member states control swathes of Arctic territory, and some [[have begun
**developing**]{.mark} their **[military
capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But unless the European Union's
tactics change, it still risks being politically marginalised and
strategically outflanked.

#### Specifically, [nuclear-powered Icebreakers]{.underline} set the stage for [American dominance]{.underline} in the Arctic.

[The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [faces a]{.mark} developing
**[crisis]{.mark}** in the Arctic]{.underline}, where our [[adversaries

**shipping**]{.mark} **routes** [and]{.mark} areas for **critical

the [[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [cannot]{.mark}]{.underline} as
[easily access **without nuclear**-powered icebreakers]{.underline}.
[**[American dominance]{.mark}** in the Arctic regions
[will]{.mark}]{.underline} continue to [[be of]{.mark} **vital
[importance]{.mark}** to our nation and our allies]{.underline}, and the
[[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [should]{.mark} **take the lead** in
[deploy]{.mark}ing [nuclear]{.mark}-powered [icebreaker]{.mark}
ships. ]{.underline}

The Strategic Gap between the United States and Our Adversaries

[The Arctic]{.underline} is a region [**rapidly growing** in
geopolitical and economic significance due to]{.underline} the [receding
ice]{.underline}, where [**new maritime routes** are
opening]{.underline}, significantly [shortening global **shipping
lanes**]{.underline}.

[It will]{.underline} also [offer **unprecedented access**
to]{.underline} vast [untapped **natural resources**]{.underline},
[including **oil**, **gas**, and **rare earth minerals**,]{.underline}
where such mining is legal [and can be done in an **environmentally
responsible manner**. ]{.underline}

Currently, [[Russia holds a]{.mark} **commanding
[lead]{.mark}**[ with]{.mark} **seven** [nuclear]{.mark}-powered
[icebreakers]{.mark}]{.underline} in operation [and **several
more**]{.underline} [under **construction**]{.underline}, including the
massive Project 22220 and Lider-class vessels, which are [designed to
keep Arctic shipping lanes **open year-round.**]{.underline} [China also
has a]{.underline} major [program to deploy **nuclear**-powered
icebreaker]{.underline} ships, even though China does not border the
Arctic. 

In stark contrast, the [[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has
**zero**]{.mark} nuclear-powered icebreakers]{.underline}, [with only
two]{.underline} conventionally powered heavy [icebreakers in
service]{.underline}, one of which, the aging Polar Star, [was
commissioned in the 1970s]{.underline}. By [[**investing** in its **own
nuclear**]{.mark}-powered icebreaker [fleet]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}[nited [S]{.mark}tates [can]{.mark} begin to
[**close** this]{.mark} **strategic [gap]{.mark}**, assert its
**sovereign interests**, [and prevent]{.mark}]{.underline} potential
[[**adversaries** from **monopolizing**]{.underline}]{.mark} critical
[[**passages** and]{.underline}]{.mark} Arctic
**[[resources]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

While the [United States]{.underline} is [working to add]{.underline}
new [[conventional]{.mark}ly powered icebreaker
[ships]{.mark}]{.underline}, including contemplating the purchase of
such ships from Finland, [these ships [will be **inferior** to]{.mark}
Russia's **[nuclear]{.mark}**-powered [ships]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
[**strategic advantages** of nuclear propulsion are]{.underline} well
[established by]{.underline} the US [**Navy's** nuclear-powered
submarines]{.underline} and aircraft carriers [and their [ability to
**project**]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}ever-present **[American
[dominance]{.mark}]{.underline}** across the globe. [These]{.underline}
strategic [advantages should]{.underline} also [be extended to
our]{.underline} nation's [icebreaker fleet]{.underline} in the Arctic.

The Role of the US Government

We believe that [[a US]{.underline}]{.mark} **[government
[program]{.mark}]{.underline}** backed by congressional authorizations
and appropriations [[could **develop** a]{.mark} US
[nuclear]{.mark}-powered [icebreaker in]{.mark}]{.underline} perhaps as
little as **[[three years']{.underline}]{.mark}** time. Since the United
States is already working with Finland to develop conventional
icebreaker ships, this relationship could be leveraged to allow [the
United States and Finland]{.underline} to [develop a nuclear-powered
icebreaker]{.underline} ship platform [in a **timely manner**, into
which the nuclear propulsion system could be inserted.]{.underline}

Icebreaker Fleet Propulsion

As CEO of Lightbridge Corporation, a leading developer of advanced
nuclear fuels, and also serving as chair of the International Council of
the American Nuclear Society, we know that [naval [nuclear propulsion
offers]{.mark} **unparalleled [endurance]{.mark}** and
**power**]{.underline}, allowing [icebreakers [to **operate
year-round**]{.mark} without]{.underline} the need for [constant
refueling]{.underline}---[[an **essential capability**]{.mark} in
the]{.underline} remote and severe [Arctic]{.underline} environment.

Since reactors designed for submarines and aircraft carriers would not
work, due to weight and other restrictions, for an icebreaker ship,
[the]{.underline} propulsion [system could be based on a **compact
reactor**]{.underline} with innovative fuel [that can power the ship
without needing to refuel]{.underline} for long durations.
[Contractors]{.underline} that produce nuclear propulsion systems for
the US Navy [could produce a]{.underline} compact pressurized [water
reactor within an **acceptable timeframe**.]{.underline}

It's Time to Close the Arctic Gap 

[Russia and China are leading]{.underline} the United States with regard
to [nuclear icebreakers]{.underline} in the Arctic. [This puts the
United States at a **disadvantage** in]{.underline} securing access to
Arctic **[shipping routes]{.underline}** and to the region's critical
**[mineral resources]{.underline}**. [To secure]{.underline} our
nation's [**strategic advantages** in the Arctic]{.underline}, the
[[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [should embark on an **expedited**
nuclear]{.mark}-powered [icebreaker]{.mark} deployment
[initiative]{.mark}]{.underline}. Our nation should deploy a nuclear
icebreaker fleet, [[the **most powerful**]{.mark} icebreaker
**[ships]{.mark}** in the world.]{.underline}

[[The Arctic is **insufficiently prioritized** amidst the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates' competing global interests. [The future]{.mark}
[battlefield]{.mark}]{.underline} is melting and [[demands US
attention]{.mark}, as a partnership between Russia and]{.underline} the
People's Republic of [China fuels strategic competition in the Arctic.
Thus, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [must adopt a **proactive
Arctic strategy**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline} working with its NATO Allies
to ensure that the Arctic remains stable and free from conflict. The
US's 2022 National Defense Strategy (NDS) outlines that the United
States "seeks a stable Arctic region characterized by adherence to
internationally agreed upon rules and norms."1) To achieve a secure
Arctic, the 2024 Arctic Strategy, produced by the U.S. Department of
Defense, follows a "monitor-and-respond" approach. However, this
reactive strategy is inadequate.2)

[Russia's]{.underline} 2022 [invasion of [Ukraine
prov]{.mark}id[es]{.mark} evidence that [Moscow will]{.mark} not adhere
to the current global order and will continue to [challenge
Western]{.mark} international [norms]{.mark}]{.underline} wherever
possible, including [[in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}. NATO's growing
appeal among European states suggests that NATO may also be called upon
to guarantee the future of Arctic stability. Instead of dividing Europe,
isolating Ukraine, and expanding its influence, Moscow's invasion of
Ukraine has resulted in a closer alliance between the United States and
its Arctic NATO allies. Moreover, NATO, with the accession of Finland
and Sweden, has expanded,, and now seven out of the eight Arctic nations
are NATO members. The alliance offers an opportunity for the United
States to strengthen its position in the Arctic region while not having
to go it alone.

[The current US Arctic Strategy insufficiently counters Russian and
Chinese strategic Arctic ambitions,]{.underline} though the makings of a
more effective Arctic Strategy already exist in the pages of the 2024
Arctic Strategy. [Washington must build on this foundation, shifting its
mindset towards the Arctic. A proactive Arctic Strategy is
needed]{.underline}, in which the United States and its NATO partners
are not afraid to define the rules and laws governing the north. Critics
of this approach will claim that taking a more assertive position in the
Arctic will further antagonize Russia and divert important resources
from the Indo-Pacific region and China. This is simply not the case.
Russia and China have already taken steps to claim and militarize the
Arctic. By acting now, the US and its NATO allies will be better
positioned to counter the threat posed by Russia and China in the Arctic
and beyond.

Why the Next War Will Be Won or Lost in the Arctic

[Climate change has accelerated strategic competition in the region
among both Arctic and non-Arctic nations,]{.underline} such as China.
Melting sea ice from rising global temperatures has created new military
and economic opportunities in the region. Since 1979, the Arctic has
warmed four times faster than the rest of the world, according to an
August 2022 scientific study published in Nature.3) [As ice rapidly
melts in the Arctic, increased access to critical rare earth
elements]{.underline}, such as platinum, copper, lithium, cobalt, and
nickel [emerge]{.underline}. Moreover, [melting ice]{.underline} is
opening more easily traversed Arctic waters, which [has led to a surge
of both [military and commercial ship activity]{.mark} in the region.
These]{.underline} two developments [[have]{.mark} [increased the
potential for **conflict in the Arctic**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

Any nation that can effectively mine, process, and refine the materials
will have a strategic advantage. These minerals are required for
developing technologies ranging from renewable energy systems to
electronics used for national defense. According to the World Bank, the
demand to produce minerals, many of which are found in the Arctic, could
increase by nearly 500 percent by 2050 to meet the growing demand for
clean energy technologies.4) China already dominates the global supply
chain for critical materials. The United States depends on these
materials for its economic competitiveness and national defense.5)

As ice melts, new routes are emerging that are more navigable. This has
resulted in more ship activity in the region. For instance, the Arctic
Council Working Group on the Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment
reports that there has been a 37 percent increase in ship numbers and
distance sailed in the Arctic over the past ten years.6) While much of
this activity is commercial, [[Russia and China]{.mark} [have]{.mark}
also [taken advantage of]{.mark} the [new]{.mark} sea [routes to
**project their naval power**]{.mark}. They have carried
out]{.underline} numerous regional [deployments]{.underline} and
patrols, [demonstrating their ability to execute military operations in
the austere Arctic climate.]{.underline}7) The expanded presence of
Russian and Chinese ships in the region poses a growing threat to NATO
member states. In October 2023, Finnish investigators suspected the
Chinese vessel NewNew Polar Bear of dragging its anchor over the seabed
and severing three Baltic telecom cables and one pipeline. While the
international community has not assigned blame wholly to China, China
later admitted to accidentally destroying an important gas pipeline
connecting Finland and Estonia in the Baltic Sea in 2024. These examples
suggest that incidents of this nature could become more likely as
military activity increases in the region.8)

Competition in the Arctic Is Heating Up: Russian and Chinese Ambitions

[The [growing partnership between Russia and China provides early
warning signs]{.mark} that the region could become a site [of]{.mark}
future [conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline} In 2021 Russia and China renewed
their 20-year-old Sino-Russian Treaty of Good Neighborliness and
Friendly Cooperation, a move described as "an act of friendship against
America."9) Moreover, both Russia and China have deep historic and
economic ties to the Arctic. NATO's expansion to include Finland and
Sweden have increased tensions in the region, while both Russia and
China have expressed their disapproval of NATO's increasing presence in
the Arctic.10) However, despite feeling antagonized by NATO's actions,
Moscow and Beijing may not have the economic and military capacities to
reshape the current international rules-based order in the Arctic in the
near term.

Despite being the only non-NATO member in the Arctic, Russia controls
over 53 percent of the Arctic coastline, making it a decisive player in
the future of the region.11) Yet, Russia's Arctic ambitions are not new.
Russia's connection with the Arctic can be traced back to the sixteenth
century, beginning with its conquest of Siberia, which was part of a
larger initiative to search for resources and trade routes.12) As the
nation matured, its Arctic ambitions did as well. [During the Cold War,
the Soviets established both a nuclear and naval presence on the Kola
Peninsula to project power against the U.S.]{.underline} With the
collapse of the Soviet Union, [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, as the de
jure inheritor of the Soviet nuclear arsenal, [[did not abandon its
**desire to be an Arctic power.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

As the Russian economy recovered in the early 2000s under Vladimir
Putin, Russia began posturing for Arctic supremacy, reopening multiple
Soviet-era military bases, modernizing its navy, and developing new
hypersonic missiles designed to evade U.S. sensors and defenses.13)
Moreover, in August 2022, Moscow announced that it would refocus its
military power on the Arctic and Nordic region.14) According to Colin
Wall, a research associate at Center for Strategic and International
Studies in Washington, "The military balance in the Arctic is heavily
weighted towards Russia." Furthermore, the International Institute for
Strategic Studies and Reuters cite that Russia's bases inside the Arctic
Circle outnumber NATO's by roughly a third.15) Russia's remilitarization
of the Arctic and its revitalized strategic partnership with China,
provides both countries with the means to challenge the current Western
rules-based international order.

Although China's Arctic history does not mirror Russia's centuries-old
presence in the north, [Beijing's desire for **Arctic supremacy** has
rapidly evolved over the past century.]{.underline} China's involvement
in the Arctic began in 1925 with the signing of the Svalbard Treaty,
providing a legal basis for China to conduct non-military activity, such
as scientific exploration, resource extraction, and fishing in the
Arctic.16) However, China's rationale to operate in the region extends
beyond scientific exploration.

In 2018 China released its first Arctic White Paper, which asserts that
it is a "Near-Arctic State."17) [[China employs a dual]{.mark}
[narrative to explain]{.mark}]{.underline} its aims in the Arctic.
Externally, Beijing appeals to foreign audiences by advocating for the
safeguarding of international interests and promoting sustainable Arctic
development. However, this is juxtaposed against the narrative it
promotes for domestic audiences, which emphasizes competition for
resources and [China's [desire to be]{.mark}come [a "polar great
power]{.mark}]{.underline}."18) The Svalbard Treaty has currently
enabled China to shroud its military activity and influence in the
Arctic as scientific exploration and global cooperation. But it is
becoming clear from its growing partnership with Russia and increasingly
aggressive military action in the Arctic that China's intentions to
reshape the international system extend well beyond the Indo-Pacific.
The U.S. and NATO would be wise to recognize China's aims in the Arctic.

The historic ties of Russia and China and their Arctic ambitions reveal
that [the Arctic is likely to be an arena for future strategic
competition.]{.underline} Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine has
temporarily bolstered the West's position in the Arctic, as previously
neutral Finland and Sweden joined NATO. Finland's accession into NATO
not only increased the NATO-Russia land border by over 650 percent and
moved the defense alliance a mere 250 miles from St. Petersburg, but it
also contributed to creating a divided Arctic, where nearly half belongs
to NATO while the remaining half is Russian territory.

Threatened by the growing alliance, in June 2022, Putin warned that if
U.S.-NATO military contingents or military infrastructure appears in
either Sweden or Finland, Russia will respond "symmetrically" by
deploying nuclear weapons to the Baltic Sea region to restore military
balance and strengthen its defenses.19) In February 2023, Putin made
good on this threat and deployed Russian ships armed with tactical
nuclear weapons to the Baltic Sea. According to Norway, this was the
first time in 30 years that this has happened.20) Then in June 2024,
Moscow began to train soldiers and sailors to deploy tactical nuclear
weapons in Leningrad, a military district bordering NATO members Norway,
Finland, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.21) As evidenced by
these actions, while Putin is not afraid to rattle the nuclear saber, it
is not likely that Russia has the military or economic capacity to
engage in a direct conventional conflict with NATO.

NATO leaders recognize that there is a finite window of time to prepare
for conflict against Russia. In 2024 the head of the Norwegian armed
forces warned that NATO countries only have two to three years to
prepare for a Russian attack. Norwegian General Eirik Kristoffersen
claims that Moscow is building up its military stockpile faster than
previously predicted, while Western nations have depleted their own
weapons by supplying them to Ukraine.22) Several other European leaders
have echoed these concerns, citing that they have between three and
eight years to prepare for a Russian attack against NATO.23) Despite
Russia's aggressive rhetoric, Moscow understands that because of its war
against Ukraine it likely will not have the capability to attack NATO in
the near future. For instance, Russia removed nearly all its ground
forces from the Finnish border to Ukraine in June 2024.24) Russia's
timeframe to launch a successful attack is dependent not only on its
economy but also on its partnership with the PRC.

Why the U.S. Needs its Arctic NATO Allies

The United States has already begun to take a more active approach in
the Arctic; however, [[the region must become a]{.mark}n even [greater
priority]{.mark}.]{.underline} Following Finnish and Swedish accession
to NATO, the alliance's center of gravity, its primary source of
strength and stability, shifted North and closer to the Russian border.
This is not the first instance of NATO borders moving closer to Russia.
In 2007, Putin provided a final "friendly" warning that NATO expansion
"represents a serious provocation that reduces the level of mutual
trust."25) The National Defense Strategy (NDS) reaffirms its commitment
to NATO, underscoring the importance of collective defense aimed at
deterring Russian aggression. Despite this stated commitment, the NDS
does not directly address how it will respond in the event that Russia
attacks a NATO member state, forcing the alliance to respond. While the
current NDS and Arctic Strategy offer assurances of protection to the
U.S. homeland, [a [proactive Arctic posture will **mitigate future
conflict**]{.mark} in the region.]{.underline}

The United States already views itself as a leader in the European
Arctic. Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has sought to
uphold international law, close gaps in governance, and protect
sovereign rights in the European Arctic.26) [[The U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates was [integral in developing]{.mark} multiple
[intergovernmental institutions]{.mark}, including the Arctic
Council]{.underline} in 1991.27) [With growing competition in
the]{.underline} European [Arctic, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[should]{.mark} continue to use its great power status to [insert itself
as a **lead actor in the region**]{.mark}]{.underline} through the
establishment of a proactive Arctic Strategy coupled with enhanced
economic and military cooperation with its Nordic NATO Allies. Today,
while Russia is engrossed in its war against Ukraine, [the United
States]{.underline} and its allies [have the opportunity to [remain one
step ahead]{.mark}.]{.underline}

sheet]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even the IPCC estimated that by 2040, the
Arctic could be ice-free. This is alarming for the earth's health and
would have disastrous consequences for humanity. It also [[raises the
possibility of **new sea routes**]{.mark}**.** [Russia]{.mark} is [going
to be the biggest beneficiary]{.mark} of these new sea routes. [Melting
of]{.mark} North [ice sheets]{.mark} also [has **significant
consequences**]{.mark} for international sea lanes of communication. The
[US military **dominance over sea**]{.mark} is [one of the **strongest
pillars** of its **global hegemony**]{.mark}. The Possibility of any
[alternative sea route]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}such as the
Northern Sea Route (NSR) is pregnant with [possibility of **[making a
dent in its dominance]{.mark}** on the high sea.]{.underline}

The [shipping conduit that links Asia with Europe]{.underline}, taken as
a whole, [would be reduced in distance by 40 per cent if the Northern
Sea Route (NSR) were preferred to Suez.]{.underline} Experts and
stakeholders repeatedly [question how the "Arctic route" can affect the
commercial importance of the Mediterranean]{.underline}, since the route
will be shorter for movement of ships and can eventually save 10-15 days
of navigation via this route. This explains why [China is so
interested]{.underline} in this alternative that enables the region to
allow Chinese goods going by the sea to [avoid important straits such as
the Suez Canal or Malacca. **[China's interest]{.mark}** in the region
is [both geoeconomic **and geopolitical.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[To sum up, the [region is going to be]{.mark} **an arena of
[geo-political contestation ]{.mark}**[between the USA and
China.]{.mark}]{.underline} As Russia is engaged in Ukraine war and will
have to bear short to medium term economic disadvantages, if not long
term due to the ongoing conflict. This will make Russia dependent on
China for economic and diplomatic support. In such a scenario, Russia
has to play second fiddle to China in the Arctic. Will other Arctic
countries succumb to US unilateral approach and bandwagon against
Russia-China duo will decide the main players of the Arctic chessboard.
In all possible scenarios, [it is going to be **[a]{.mark}n Africa like
[scramble]{.mark}** [for resources]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Russian Federation

[[Russia\'s **nuc**]{.mark}**lear [arsenal]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
strike capability [[remains]{.mark} an]{.underline} enduring,
**[[existential threat]{.underline}]{.mark}** to the United States,
democracy, and our peaceful Allies and Partners. [A [central concern
is]{.mark} Russia\'s non-strategic **nuclear [weapons
stockpile]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}]{.underline} the Kremlin\'s [[potential
to use]{.mark} these [weapons in **crisis**]{.mark} **or
conflict**]{.underline}.

[Russia pursues **[malign activities]{.mark}**]{.underline}, including
**[military aggression]{.underline}**, [aimed at **undermining
democracy**]{.underline}, the [rules-based **international
order**]{.underline}, [and has]{.underline} a [willingness to use force
to achieve its]{.underline} aims. Russia pursues these activities
[despite widespread international condemnation]{.underline} and economic
sanctions. [President Putin leverages **[coercive]{.mark} and
aggressive** [policies to counter]{.mark} **Western [influence]{.mark}**
and threaten peace]{.underline} and stability in Europe.

Russia employs [[grey area]{.mark} activities]{.underline} to
[[maintain]{.underline}]{.mark} its purported
**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**phere **[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**f
**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**nfluence, [and [attempts to coerce]{.mark}
**neighboring [sovereign nations]{.mark}**]{.underline} and form
fractures between Allies at NATO. Russia meddles in European politics,
abrogates its responsibilities under the Treaty on Conventional Armed
Forces in Europe, engaged in an unprovoked and unjustified armed attack
against Ukraine, and retains a military presence on sovereign soil in
Moldova and Georgia against the will of those nations. Russia maintains
a large conventional force presence along NATO\'s borders and conducts
snap exercises to increase instability. Russia employs unconventional
tools, ranging from disinformation campaigns, malicious cyber
activities, and the manipulation of energy markets to support Moscow\'s
efforts at political subversion and economic intimidation. These tools
and others are intended [to coerce]{.underline}, weaken, [and divide our
Allies and Partners in the European **theater and beyond**]{.underline}.
[Russian leadership habitually misinterprets warnings]{.underline} and
has [directly **instigated armed conflict** with Ukraine]{.underline},
while [continuing to expand the space below the level of **armed
conflict**]{.underline} in other Allied and Partner nations.

Beyond Ukraine, [[Russia continues]{.mark} its military [modernization
while displaying]{.mark} its **[destabilizing]{.mark}**]{.underline}
capabilities during [operations in Syria]{.underline}, [and
Libya]{.underline}. As a result, the [Russian government has growing
confidence in its **military leadership**]{.underline} and menu of
hybrid, conventional, strategic, and non-strategic nuclear capabilities
needed to underwrite its 21st century security approach. Today, [Russia
underpins its military with]{.underline} Integrated Air Defense Systems

People\'s Republic of China (PRC) The PRC seeks to increase its access,
presence, and influence in Europe and globally to achieve its objective
of being socially-stable, economically prosperous, and militarily
powerful by 2050. The PRC engages in aggressive and subversive economic
and diplomatic activities in the USEUCOM AOR not only to find markets to
strengthen the Chinese economy, but also to establish presence at key
transportation nodes and increase its political influence. China\'s
foreign direct investment, government-backed business ventures, and
infrastructure deals not only secure the PRC\'s advantage in global
trade, market access, and technological standards, but also provides
Beijing an avenue to assert influence at the expense of enduring U.S.,
Allied, and Partner interests. The PRC primarily pursues bilateral
deals, as well as engagements, through PRC-led forums such as the 16+1
Cooperation Framework (Lithuania withdrew in 2021) with Central and
Eastern European nations. European nations are growing increasingly
skeptical of these engagements and have identified the formats as
divisive. The PRC focuses on seizing the \"high ground\" in critical and
emerging technology sectors with military application, including
Artificial Intelligence, advanced robotics, quantum technologies, and
hypersonic systems, and at the same time it seeks to export its national
technology standards globally. The PRC\'s efforts to expand 5G networks
throughout Europe via state-backed firms, such as Huawei and ZTE, pose
significant security risks to the interests and military forces if the
U.S., Allies, and Partners. These networks place intellectual property,
sensitive information, technology, and private personal information at
heightened risk of acquisition and exploitation by the Chinese
government. PRC continues to invest significantly in European ports and
transportation nodes, as well as other critical infrastructure in
Europe. USEUCOM works closely with our European defense counterparts to
articulate risks and establish a shared understanding of the security
environment. We also support the U.S. interagency in highlighting the
shared values, interests, and equitable business practices that
distinguish the current rules-based international order. European
nations are becoming increasingly aware of, and concerned about, the
strings attached to capital and investment from the PRC, and are
recognizing that the PRC is a systemic rival. Together, we must hold the
PRC accountable for its predatory and unfair practices and ensure that
Western technologies do not facilitate the PRC\'s military buildup.
Several countries have removed Huawei from their networks, imposed new
investment screening mechanisms, and have decided not to choose Chinese
investments particularly because of the threat this poses to European
security. More than at any time in recent years, our European Allies and
Partners recognize the risk PRC presents to European security. Eastern
Flank NATO\'s Eastern Flank remains a strategic focal point. It remains
at risk of Russian aggression and lies on the territorial periphery of
Russia\'s invasion of peaceful Ukraine. The geopolitical alignment of
the Bucharest 9 - Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary,
Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia - reminds Russia of its
limited sphere of control and NATO\'s appeal to regional states. These
states have made significant contributions to assist Ukraine against
Russia\'s aggression. Collectively, they have provided both lethal and
non-lethal assistance, have opened their borders to Ukraine refugees,
closed their air space, and supported economic sanctions against Russia.
In the Baltics, the Russian government actively targets ethnic Russian
population with extensive propaganda and malign influence operations,
while conducting cyber operations to weaken Alliance resolve. Russian
forces along NATO\'s periphery in its Western Military District and
Kaliningrad hold a geographic and numerical advantage over regional
military and NATO enhanced Forward Presence forces. This imbalance
emphasizes the importance of timely indications and warnings that enable
the positioning of combat-capable forces to deter and respond if
deterrence fails. NATO Allies continue their commitment to collective
defense. Enhanced Forward Presence bolsters NATO\'s posture in the east
with four multinational battlegroups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and
Poland. Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Slovakia are all currently
working on additional posture plans within a NATO context. In the face
of Russia\'s aggression, the United States and our NATO Allies have
committed additional forces demonstrating our collective resolve. NATO
air and missile defense forces reinforce collective security and
stability through Baltic air policing operations and air defense
exercises. Each of these states contributes to their own defense and the
three Baltic States have expanded their efforts to control the maritime
domain in their littoral. Poland continues to meet Alliance commitments
through defense budget increases, infrastructure improvements, and
logistical support via the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, and
its modernization efforts include Abrams tanks, Patriot air defense, and
F-35 weapon system acquisitions. Poland also hosts the U.S. Army\'s
Fifth Corps forward headquarters in Poznan, providing a needed level of
command and control to synchronize multi-national tactical formations
operating in Europe. Poland also demonstrates its commitment to
collective security by hosting additional U.S. forces during the current
crisis. Black Sea Region Russia continues to exert malign influence and
demonstrate its willingness to use overt force in the Black Sea region
to include use of its Black Sea fleet to attack Ukraine. The war in
Ukraine, instigated solely by Russia, continues to destabilize Ukrainian
security and the entire region. In addition to armed attack against
Ukraine, Russia continues to subvert the Ukrainian government through
malicious cyber activities and information operations, illegally
recognizing Ukraine\'s eastern areas of Donetsk and Luhansk as sovereign
states, and continuing to illegally occupy Crimea. Contrary to Russia\'s
intent, these coercive actions reinforce Ukraine\'s aspirations of
membership in Euro-Atlantic institutions. Russia\'s aggression also led
to a deployment of U.S. forces in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland,
Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary. The Russian government exerts influence
over South Caucasus countries by exploiting regional tensions and
unresolved military conflicts, and employing economic levers and
provocative information activities. Russia maintains leverage over
Georgia by occupying the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia,
blocking free movement of people and goods within Georgia\'s territory,
detaining and harassing civilians living in and near occupied areas, and
undermining the NATO membership aspirations of Georgia and other partner
nations. After brokering a ceasefire arrangement between Armenia and
Azerbaijan in November 2020, Russia increased its military presence in
the region by deploying 2,000 troops to Nagorno-Karabakh as
\"peacekeepers.\" Since the early 1990s, Russia has continued to occupy
the Transnistria region of Moldova with 1,500 \"peacekeepers\" without
host nation consent. Moldovan President Sandu has called for the
withdrawal of Russian troops and we continue to support a peaceful
resolution to the Transnistrian conflict and full reintegration of
Transnistria with Moldova.

[Atlantic and the **Arctic Region**]{.underline}

[As part of the **global ocean**]{.underline}, the Atlantic and
[**[Arctic]{.mark} Oceans** [must remain open]{.mark} and [free to
**facilitate commerce**]{.mark} between Europe]{.underline}, **[North
America]{.underline}**, [and other international markets]{.underline}.
We ensure these vital sea lines of communication remain open by securing
the Greenland, Iceland, United Kingdom gap, enabling access between the
Atlantic and Arctic. USEUCOM coordinates with U. S. Northern Command
(USNORTHCOM) in these regions ensuring a comprehensive approach between
Euro-Atlantic and homeland security. Collaborating with our European
defense counterparts, we work to [enhance interoperability and
proficiency]{.underline}, [while demonstrating **collective
resolve**]{.underline} to counter malign behavior.

In the Arctic, [[Russia continues to develop]{.mark} its **[Northern Sea
Route]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the [PRC seeks increased access to
expand its **Polar Silk Road**]{.underline} initiative. [The Chinese
government continues to invest in **Russian energy**]{.underline} and
[seeks economic footholds among **Arctic nations** to gain influence
over **regional governance**]{.underline}. To ensure openness, USEUCOM
joint forces maintain near persistent North Atlantic and Arctic presence
while strengthening all-domain relationships with Allies and Partners.
Alongside our UK, French, Norwegian, and Canadian counterparts, U.S.
maritime forces continue to demonstrate maritime capability and
credibility presence in the region.

The [[existing]{.mark} rules-based international [order benefits
**all**]{.mark} **Arctic [nations]{.mark}** by [facilitating
sustainable]{.mark} **economic [development]{.mark}**]{.underline},
fostering cooperation[, and promoting a stable]{.underline},
**[conflict-free region]{.underline}**. As a strategic corridor, a [more
open and active Arctic region will increasingly connect the
**[U.S.]{.mark} Homeland**]{.underline}, Europe, [and the
Indo-Pacific]{.underline}. In concert with other Arctic advocates, [via
a **[whole-of-gov]{.mark}ernment approach**]{.underline}, USEUCOM [[must
continue to maintain]{.mark} a **[credible]{.mark} Arctic
[deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline} to [ensure that growing competition
in this dynamic region **does not lead to conflict**]{.underline}.

The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki demonstrated the unprecedented
destructive power of nuclear weapons. However, even [in an all-out
**[nuc]{.mark}lear [war]{.mark}** [between the
**U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[and
**Russia**]{.underline}]{.mark}, despite horrific casualties, neither
country's population is likely to be completely destroyed by the direct
effects of the blast, fire, and radiation.8 [The aftermath]{.underline}
could be much worse: the burning of flammable materials [could
[send]{.mark} massive amounts of [**smoke** into the
atmosphere]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[which]{.mark} would **absorb
sunlight** and [cause]{.mark} sustained **global
[cooling]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [severe **[ozone
loss]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[and **ag**]{.underline}]{.mark}ricultural
**[[disruption]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- [a nuclear winter]{.underline}.

According to one model 9 , [an all-out [exchange]{.mark} of **4,000
weapons**]{.underline}10 [[could]{.mark} lead to a [drop]{.mark} in
global [temperatures]{.mark} of [around **8°C**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[making it **impossible to grow food**]{.underline}]{.mark} for 4 to 5
years. This could leave some [[survivors]{.underline}]{.mark} in parts
of Australia and New Zealand, but they [[would be in a]{.mark} very
[**precarious situation** and]{.mark} the [threat]{.mark} of
**extinction** [from other sources **would be
great**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[An exchange]{.mark} on this scale [is
**only possible** between]{.mark} the [**US** and
**Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline} who have more than 90% of the world's
nuclear weapons, with stockpiles of around 4,500 warheads each, although
many are not operationally deployed.11 Some models suggest that even [a
small **[regional nuclear war]{.mark}**]{.underline} involving 100
nuclear weapons would produce a nuclear winter serious enough to put two
billion people at risk of starvation,12 though this estimate might be
pessimistic.13 Wars on this scale [[are **unlikely** to lead to]{.mark}
outright human **[extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but this does
suggest that conflicts which are around an order of magnitude larger may
be likely to threaten civilisation. It should be emphasised that there
is very large uncertainty about the effects of a large nuclear war on
global climate. This remains an area where increased academic research
work, including more detailed climate modelling and a better
understanding of how survivors might be able to cope and adapt, would
have high returns.

It is very difficult to precisely estimate the probability of
existential risk from nuclear war over the next century, and existing
attempts leave very large confidence intervals. According to many
experts, the most likely nuclear war at present is between India and
Pakistan.14 However, given the relatively modest size of their arsenals,
[the [risk]{.mark} of human **extinction** [is plausibly greater
from]{.mark} a conflict between the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[and **Russia**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Tensions between these countries have increased in recent years and it
seems unreasonable to rule out the possibility of them rising further in
the future.

#### Preserving US hegemony is key to prevent a litany of existential risks

**Kangabam 25** \[Clinish Kangabam, BA in Political Science and
Government from Royal Global University and MA in International
Relations from Amity University, \"American Hegemony Under Strain:
Economic, Military, and Diplomatic Challenges,\" Quest Journal of

The concept of [U.S. hegemony has been central to shaping the global
liberal order]{.underline} post World War II. Anchored in principles
such as free trade, multilateralism, and the promotion of democracy, the
U.S. has acted as the primary architect and guarantor of this order.
[However, in recent decades, signs of a relative decline in U.S.
dominance have become increasingly evident.]{.underline} This decline
stems from multiple factors which includes economic competition from
rising powers like China, strategic overreach, domestic political
polarization, and growing doubt or questions about the benefits of
globalization.

The weakening of U.S. hegemony raises profound questions about the
future of the global liberal order. As traditional pillars of this order
face challenges, there is growing uncertainty about whether emerging
powers will support, reshape, or reject its foundational norms and
institutions. The evolving global dynamics may lead to the adaptation of
the liberal order in a multipolar context or a fragmentation into
competing spheres of influence.

[The [decline of U.S. hegemony has emerged as a **critical
issue**]{.mark}]{.underline} in international relations, [[raising
questions about]{.mark} [the]{.mark} future of [global order]{.mark},
the [stability of]{.mark} multilateral [institutions]{.mark},
and]{.underline} the sustainability of [liberal democratic
values.]{.underline} Hegemony, in the context of international
relations, refers to the dominance of a single state that exerts
economic, political, and military influence on the global stage. Since
the end of World War II, [the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [has played this hegemonic
role]{.underline}, shaping the rules and norms of the international
system[. Its [power]{.mark} has [underpinned **global economic
stability**, **security**,]{.mark} and the promotion of liberal
values.]{.underline} The United States has long served as the anchor of
the global economy. Its [leadership in [establishing
institutions]{.mark}]{.underline} such as the International Monetary
Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization (WTO) was
instrumental in [[promoting]{.mark} [economic liberalization]{.mark} and
fostering an interconnected global marketplace.]{.underline} U.S.
economic power has supported trade agreements, ensured financial
stability, and facilitated global economic recovery during crises, such
as the 2008 financial meltdown. [A [decline in U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline}
economic [[influence]{.mark} could [fragment the global
economy]{.mark}]{.underline} into competing blocs, [reducing cooperation
and increasing economic volatility]{.underline} (Ikenberry,2011).

Through its vast military capabilities and strategic alliances,
particularly NATO, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has
acted as a guarantor of global security.]{.underline} The [\"[Pax
Americana\" era marked by reduced conflicts and a]{.underline}]{.mark}
[relatively [stable international order]{.mark}]{.underline} was
underpinned by U.S. military interventions and deterrence strategies.
For example, U.S. engagement in Asia and the Middle East ensured
regional stability by containing threats such as Soviet expansion during
the Cold War and later, terrorism. [A [weakening U.S]{.mark}.
[]{.mark}security [role]{.mark} could [lead to]{.mark} **[power
vacuums]{.mark}**, increased [**militarization**, and
**instability**]{.mark} in conflict-prone regions]{.underline} (Layne,
2018).

[U.S. hegemony has supported the global spread of liberal democratic
principles, human rights, and the rule of law]{.underline}. Its
influence on global governance has been evident in institutions like the
United Nations and its advocacy for multilateralism. [A diminished U.S.
role could **[embolden authoritarian regimes]{.mark}** and
challenge]{.underline} the primacy of liberal [democratic
values]{.underline} (Acharya, 2017).

[In the past few months, **global [trade ]{.mark}**[has been **held
back** by **disruptions** at]{.mark} two **critical [shipping
routes]{.mark}**[. **Attacks on vessels** ]{.mark}in the Red
Sea]{.underline} area [[**reduced traffic** through the Suez
Canal]{.underline}]{.mark}, the shortest maritime route between Asia and
Europe, through which about 15 percent of global maritime trade volume
normally passes. Instead, [several [shipping companies
**diverted**]{.mark} their [ships around]{.mark} the [Cape of Good
Hope]{.mark}. This [**increased delivery times** by 10 days]{.mark} or
more on average, [**hurting companies**]{.mark} with limited
inventories.]{.underline}

On the other side of the world, [[a **severe drought** at the Panama
Canal]{.mark} has forced authorities to impose restrictions
t]{.underline}hat have substantially reduced daily ship crossings since
last October, [[**slowing down** maritime trade]{.mark} through another
[key **chokepoint**]{.mark} that usually accounts for about 5 percent of
global maritime trade.]{.underline}

The Chart of the Week [uses data]{.underline} from our PortWatch
platform [to show **trade volume** that transits through these three
critical shipping lanes.]{.underline} Our high-frequency transit
estimates indicate [that [the volume of trade]{.mark} that [passed
through the Suez Canal]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[dropped by 50
percent]{.underline}**]{.mark} year-over-year [in the first two months
of the year,]{.underline} and the volume of trade transiting around the
Cape of Good Hope surged by an estimated 74 percent above last year's
level. Meanwhile, [the transit trade [volume through the Panama Canal
**fell by** ]{.mark}**almost [32 percent]{.mark}** []{.mark}compared
with the prior year]{.underline}.

The platform also shows that in January and February 2024, there was a
6.7 percent decline year-over-year in port calls to the 70 ports we
track in sub-Saharan Africa. The corresponding declines for the European
Union and the Middle East and Central Asia were 5.3 percent. These
decreases likely reflect the transitory effects of longer shipping
times. [If continued, the [**ripple effects** of these
disruptions]{.mark} could temporarily [**ha**mper some **supply chains**
]{.mark}in affected countries and cause **upward pressure** on
inflation]{.underline} (in part due to higher shipping costs).

#### Expanding trade routes, or logistical activities are key to increase the volume of trade\-\--and economic growth.

The [[literature review indicated]{.mark} that research on the impact of
[logistics performance on **trade volume**]{.mark} is
limited,]{.underline} with existing studies differing in methodology and
variables. This study utilized the Entropy-TOPSIS multi-criteria
decision-making methods to evaluate logistics performance, trade volume,
and economic development among the top 20 countries with the highest
logistics performance scores. The unique aspects of this study include
its choice of countries, distinct methodologies, and the policy
implications proposed.

The Netherlands ranked first among the countries based on the criteria
of economic growth, logistics performance, and trade volume. If the
evaluation was performed with the data from 2018 without the weights of
these criteria, then the trade volume of the Netherlands in the decision
matrix would be 100,1, and the contribution to economic growth would be
3,5. The logistics performance rate of 4,07 also contributed to the
Netherlands being the highest country in terms of general performance.
The results show how [all criteria have an **[important]{.mark} role**
in determining the values that are generated after the data are
weighted]{.underline}. The entropy weighted TOPSIS method revealed that
Japan was the country with the lowest performance. Despite its trade
volume ratio of 97,2, based on nonweighted data, Japan contributes to
economic growth by 0,8. A logistics performance rate of 3,99 also puts
Japan at the end of the list.

In summary, [[countries should]{.underline}]{.mark} also be good at
logistics activities to [**[increase their trade volume]{.mark}**, which
[has a]{.mark}n [important share]{.mark} in ensuring [economic
growth]{.mark}. [These results **parallel**]{.mark} those of [previous
studies ]{.mark}]{.underline}(Marti, Martín, and Puertas, 2017; Erkan,
2014b; Uca, İnce, and Sumen, 2016). [The [competitive and cost
advantages]{.mark} achieved through logistics activities will **[boost
trade volume]{.mark}** over the [long term and foster]{.mark} a
**favorable environment** for **[economic growth]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
To achieve a good level of logistics performance, [[countries should
increase]{.mark} their]{.underline} R&D activities and improve the
quality of science, technology, and **[[transportation
services]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[[Globalization and increased competition]{.mark} have [made
logistics]{.mark} an important component of global trade]{.underline}.
For developing countries, [enhancing logistics performance and
leveraging globalization benefits are [crucial]{.mark} for participating
[in **global trade**.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Efficient]{.mark} logistics
[activities lower production costs]{.mark} and improve access to goods
and servic]{.underline}es. To enable countries to access goods and
services affordably, promptly, and reliably, it is essential to improve
the quality of trade related infrastructure through better logistics
services. As mentioned before[, logistics performance is [effective at
increasing **trade volume**]{.mark}]{.underline}, attracting FDI,
enhancing product diversity, [and **[ultimately achieving economic
growth]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [An increase in trade volume in a country
not only contributes to economic growth and development but also
[provides an opportunity to participate in **global trade** ]{.mark}and
gain a larger share of the global trade pie]{.underline}. To accomplish
this, it is essential to improve logistics performance, increase related
investments, and update policies accordingly. The high logistics
performance observed in developed countries supports these assertions.
In this context, the studies of Martí, Puertas, and García (2014);
Korinek and Sourdin (2011); Kunaka, Mustra, and Saez (2013); and
Lakshmanan (2007) have shown parallel findings. The role of logistics in
all sectors of agriculture, industry, and service in developed countries
should not be underestimated. For this reason, developing countries in
particular should attach importance to logistics activities to gain cost
advantages and additional gains from trade volume. The logistics sector
is considered a vital element of developed economies, and many studies
have investigated its influence on a country's welfare (Özdağoğlu et
al., 2022; D\'Aleo, 2015; Altıntaş, 2022). The service quality in
logistics parallels the richness of the economy (Arvis, et al., 2014).
It is very difficult for national economies to achieve economic growth
without logistics performance. In this respect, it can be emphasized
that countries should pay attention to their own capabilities and
logistics performance indicators when evaluating their economies and
that they should not ignore these details in their decisions.

[Investment in logistics is **crucial** for increasing trade
volume]{.underline}. Logistics is a sector in which intense competition
is going through rapid change, and it requires innovation. In
particular, the sector needs to keep up with changes in information and
communication technologies. Companies should also adapt to Logistics
4.0, which is the name given to the transformation of logistics.

#### The use of Arctic trade routes presents an opportunity for economic benefits and increased global shipping.

Whilst [the Arctic presents many challenging weather
conditions]{.underline}, as well as dangerous working conditions for
ship crew, [the opening of [new Arctic passages provides **strong
economic**]{.mark} [**benefits** in terms of reduced **shipping
distances**, **times**, and **costs**]{.mark}.]{.underline} With the
continued warming of Arctic temperatures, [the **ice-free period**
throughout the Arctics]{.underline} main shipping lanes is expected to
[**grow** from 30 days]{.underline} in 2010, [to 120 days]{.underline}
by 2050 (Borgerson, 2009). This increase [is [ice-free period
mean]{.mark}s that more [ships can now travel through]{.mark} Arctic
[shipping lanes]{.mark},]{.underline} creating multiple benefits. [The
first benefit is the [reduction of **travel time** and distance for
ships, increasing **supply chain**]{.mark} [**efficiency**,]{.mark} and
**extending shelf life** for perishable goods, leading to a reduction of
food]{.underline} waste. This is well represented between Rotterdam and
multiple major Asian ports in Table 2:

\[Table 2 omitted\]

Additionally, the decreased [distance [allows firms to adopt a
**super-slow sailing strategy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Super slow
sailing [involves a ship decreasing its average speed]{.mark}
significantly during shipping, resulting in a [possible **100%
increase** in **energy efficiency**]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, a
ship travelling from Rotterdam to Tokyo, [can reduce its speed by 40%
going over the Arctic]{.underline} in compared to using the Suez Canal,
[[and still]{.mark} [arrive at the same time]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Schøyen & Bråthen, 2011). This results in [a [**significant reduction**
of]{.mark} [**greenhouse gases**, as well as **fuel costs**]{.mark} for
shipping companies.]{.underline} The adoption of super-slow sailing has
saved shipping giant Maersk more than \$100 Million US Dollars (USD)
since it adapted its ships to super-slow sailing in 2007 (Vidal, 2010).

[The availability of Arctic shipping routes will [also r]{.mark}educe
the amount of [congestive **pressure**]{.mark} [on]{.mark} vital
[**choke points** in supply chains]{.mark},]{.underline} such as the
Suez Canal (17228 vessels per year), the Panama Canal (14323 vessels per
year), and the Strait of Malacca (60000 vessels per year)
(PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2011). [[Due to]{.mark} the [high quantity of
vessels]{.mark} passing through these]{.underline} [bottlenecks,
[**blockages** and]{.mark} **accidental [collisions]{.mark}** [can stall
world trade for **weeks**]{.mark}, creating massive, **unexpected
costs** and **time delays**]{.underline}. One example of this was
realized in March of 2021, when the

container ship the "Ever Given", ran aground in the Suez Canal. The Ever
Given ran aground in a vital one-way navigational section of the Suez
Canal, blocking around 430 ships from passing through the Suez Canal,
and redirecting hundreds more around the southern tip of Africa[. For
[an entire week]{.mark}, the [blockage stopped around **3% of global
trade**]{.mark}, whilst [**every additional day**]{.mark} of the
blockage [cost]{.mark} global trade around **[\$9 billion
USD]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}(Notteboom et al., 2024).

Whilst these kinds of blockages are not a regular occurrence, [the
dangers of blockages as well as the negative effects of congestion are
clear. The [Arctic sea routes]{.mark} provide [a
**cost-effective**]{.mark} [alternative]{.mark} which does not suffer
from the same congestive pressure, whilst **simultaneously avoiding**
the **risk of blockages** and **accidental collisions.**]{.underline}

#### Economic decline leads to extinction.

In sum, [this [statistical analysis shows]{.mark} that an **[economic
slowdown]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[increases]{.mark} the [likelihood
of]{.mark} **initiating military [conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Specifically, [economically troubled]{.underline} autocracies [act more
**aggressively**]{.underline} toward democracies whose economies depend
on them. [Political unrest also]{.underline} **[increases]{.underline}**
[conflict initiation]{.underline}, as many studies of diversionary
conflict have argued. However, autocracies suffering from political
troubles do not seem to target economically dependent democracies.
Democracies with smaller economies seem to be attractive targets for
economically troubled autocracies whose leaders may blame the
politically different partner's 'unfair' trade and currency practices
and domestic policies for the deteriorating economy. The autocracies
will present their military decisions as inevitable to correct
international wrongs and reboot the national economy. Meanwhile,
[[leaders facing **political unrest**]{.underline}]{.mark} [may
[seek]{.mark} [diversionary **targets**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[**[initiating]{.mark} a [conflict]{.mark}** through which they can
mobilize their **support base**]{.underline} (and marginalize opposition
groups) [by [exploiting]{.mark} **ideological**, **religious**, and/or
**ethnic [identities]{.mark}**]{.underline} [of 'us' and
'them'.]{.underline} Future studies should seek to unravel the complex
relationship between types and levels of domestic unrest and types and
combinations of political regimes, in either the presence or absence of
diversionary conflict. The findings of this study suggest that [an
attractive target is not **predetermined**]{.underline} [but is closely
related to the **domestic**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[international]{.underline}** [situation confronted by
leaders]{.underline} who are battling for their political survival.
Summary and implications [Since the 2000s]{.underline}, many pundits and
[[scholars]{.mark} have [attributed]{.mark}]{.underline} **[two [rising
powers']{.mark}]{.underline}** [instances of [aggression to]{.mark}
their **[domestic problems]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Russia's invasion
of **Ukraine**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}]{.mark} [annexation of
[Crimea]{.mark}]{.underline} and its deployment of troops to Syria,
[along with [China's]{.mark} assertive [actions]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[in]{.mark} the **[S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina
[S]{.mark}ea**]{.underline}, have been seen as aggressions arising out
of domestic weakness (Kaplan, 2016). [Some have attributed China's
recent **provocative** actions against **India**,
**Japan**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} **[Taiwan]{.underline}** [to
its struggling economy]{.underline} in the wake of the pandemic (Myers,
2020). In the post-Cold War period, these two great powers, often
regarded as revisionist powers, have regained their national
capabilities to some extent and have sought higher status in
international politics (Larson & Shevchenko, 2010). What made them more
aggressive in the 2010s? One promising explanation is their decreasing
economic growth rates. Due to their abundance of natural and human
resources, the two former communist countries had maintained their
increased status relative to their neighboring states since the 2000s or
even earlier. However, falling energy prices and the reform-incapable
structures of their economies retarded their further growth and
increased the burden on their authoritarian leaders, who also had to
manage domestic calls for political freedom and maintain the legitimacy
of their rule. According to this article's causal explanation, [Russia
and China [became **more revisionist**]{.mark} **actor**]{.underline}s
in the 2010s [at least partly [because]{.mark} their **[economies went
downhill]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and their aggressions were directed
at]{.underline} **[smaller]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[more
vulnerable]{.underline}** [economies]{.underline}. A slowing economy and
economic dependence have both individual and interactive effects on
military conflict in international politics. [Slow growth rates
contribute]{.underline} **[positively to conflict
initiation]{.underline}**, especially when an autocracy suffering from a
slowing economy targets a democracy whose economy is dependent on the
autocracy. Whereas economic interdependence has been regarded by many
liberal scholars as a reason for international cooperation, this study
shows why and how asymmetric interdependence contributes to interstate
conflict by articulating its interaction with an economic slowdown in a
dyadic relationship. [Both political unrest and economic
problems]{.underline} **[have destabilizing effects]{.underline}** [on
international politics]{.underline}, but their effects differ when
economically dependent democracies are the target. Future research
should compare different types of domestic unrest and their effects on
international relations with sophisticated logic and strong evidence.
This analysis shows that economic growth has two distinct effects.
[Slower growth makes **one state weaker**]{.underline} [than others and
its leaders]{.underline} **[more vulnerable]{.underline}** [to domestic
challenges.]{.underline} [A state's economic slowdown not only causes
**a change**]{.underline} [in the [balance of]{.mark} **economic
[power]{.mark}**]{.underline} [so as to [favor]{.mark} its
[competitor]{.mark}]{.underline} [but]{.underline} [also
[increases]{.mark} the [troubled state's **foreign aggression**]{.mark},
which can **harm its adversary**.]{.underline} Therefore, it is
uncertain whether one state's economic slowdown benefits its rival's
security. An autocracy's slowing economy can be a warning, rather than
good news, to its democratic opponents if the latter maintain economic
relationships with the former. In this regard, economic sanctions may
provoke the target leader's diversionary tactic of blaming its poor
economy on the sanctioner. We can see this pattern in Tokyo's surprise
attack on Pearl Harbor at a time of US sanctions against Japan, which
had continued since the late 1930s. [The current **global economic
outlook**]{.underline} [is]{.underline} **[uncertain]{.underline}** [in
the wake of COVID-19]{.underline}. Although we do not yet know the
pandemic's long-term economic consequences, all states will likely
struggle with slower growth and the erosion of democracy and will engage
in more protectionist policies to reboot their economies and save major
industries. In this context, [we should be **especially
concerned**]{.underline} [about the risk that **troubled**]{.underline}
[economies pose]{.underline} **[to international
security]{.underline}**. As this study's findings suggest, [slower
growth causes]{.underline} **[domestic problems]{.underline}**, [which
often lead to the]{.underline} **[diversionary use]{.underline}** [of
force against foreign states]{.underline}. If we cannot prevent
struggling leaders from using diversionary tactics, [worsening
economies]{.underline} in authoritarian states [will]{.underline} likely
**[drive such states]{.underline}** [into a more
**confrontational**]{.underline} [or]{.underline}
**[aggressive]{.underline}** [stance toward their economic
**partners**,]{.underline} if not toward political and ideological
partners. We can all hope world leaders will realize that this is a time
to beat a global pandemic and an economic recession, not to beat up on a
foreign state.

#### The Northwest Passage is critical to trade and the global shipping industry, but the presence multi-year ice leaves commercial vessels vulnerable.

multi-year ice**

[[Shipping is a **fundamental industry**, supporting]{.mark} society as
we know it, representing [**trillions of dollars** in **annual trade**,
and]{.mark} a[ccounting for transport of]{.mark} nearly [**90%** of
**all goods globally**]{.mark}]{.underline}[1]{.mark} . Shipping through
Canadian Arctic waters is of [particular interest globally due to the
potential of the **[Northwest Passage]{.mark}** (NWP)]{.underline}
(Fig. 1) emerging as [[a **viable**, **shorter**, and]{.mark}
potentially [**more economical** alternative to traditional]{.mark}
shipping [routes]{.mark} connecting the Atlantic and Pacific
Oceans]{.underline} (i.e., Panama and Suez Canals). Global conflict
involving Russia at this time has also increased pressure on the NWP as
some [nations may be **reluctant** to utilise or consider the near-term
future utilisation of the **N**orthern **S**ea **R**oute]{.underline}.
The NWP comprises of a southern shallow water route which passes to the
south of Victoria Island, and the northern deep-water route which
extends through the Parry Channel (Fig. 1). Both routes share the same
eastern entrance (western exit) to (from) the Canadian Arctic
Archipelago (CAA) through Lancaster Sound. Currently, the majority of
ships (97%) use the southern route of the NWP2 (Fig. 1), but the
northern route is shorter and considered more efficient and thus is of
most interest for commercial and transit-based operations. Although fog
is a significant hazard to navigation of either route3,4 , [[sea
ice]{.mark} has been [the primary obstacle to **timely
navigation**]{.mark} through the NWP. [**Sea ice**]{.mark} in the Arctic
[has experienced considerable declines]{.mark}]{.underline} over the
satellite record, particularly in the summer months5 . In the Canadian
Arctic, [sea ice area has declined by [5--20% per
decade]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}(depending on the region) between
1968 and 20166 . Associated with the recent decline in sea ice, the
number of voyages taken by vessels has quadrupled since 1990 across the
Canadian Arctic2,7 . Accordingly[, **[increased ship
navigability]{.mark}** in the Canadian Arctic [is projected to
continue]{.mark} in the upcoming decades,]{.underline} associated with
the gradual loss of sea ice8--13.as well as other shifting
socio-economic drivers. Complicatingfuture projections of the likelihood
of increased navigability in the NWP is that the latest state-of-the-art
climate models have difficulty capturing local-scale ice dynamics within
the narrow channels of the CAA11,14,15. This is particularly important
to [[vessels transiting the NWP]{.underline}]{.mark}, as they [become
[susceptible to]{.mark} the southward [flow of **thick MYI** from the
Arctic Ocean]{.mark}]{.underline}[16]{.mark},17 a process that [has
increased as a result of climate change]{.underline}18--20. The origin
of this thick MYI is The Last Ice Area (LIA) located to the north of the
CAA and Greenland21 and is the thickest in the Arctic22--24. [While its
character is [not as robust as]{.mark} it was
[historically]{.mark}25,26, this [ice is still]{.mark} **expected to be
[present ]{.mark}**[even]{.mark} when the rest of the Arctic Ocean is
sea ice free [during the summer]{.mark} months]{.underline}14,27 and
will continue to flow southward into the channels of the NWP28. It is
also worth emphasising that the relationship between declining sea ice
and increased shipping activity is not solely driven by physical changes
in sea ice but that economic drivers such as natural resource
extraction, global commodity prices, and other socio-economic
factors7,29,30 also play a role. As a result, future changes in shipping
will not solely be based on sea ice presence/absence but also by
strategic and marketing considerations -- that is, [[sea ice
conditions]{.mark} will not drive future shipping traffic but,
**[foundationally]{.mark}** it could certainly [enable or prevent
it.]{.mark}]{.underline}

clarity

The [number of [vessels navigating]{.mark} these waters \[[Northwestern
Passage\] is lower]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}compared to the NSR.
This is [[due to]{.underline}]{.mark} various reasons, including
[complex geography]{.underline} (there are many narrow and shallow
corridors along this specific passage), as well as ocean currents,
[along with **[drifting ice packs]{.mark}** that **[block]{.mark}** many
of the [entrance and exit site]{.mark}]{.underline}[s]{.mark}. Also,
there is a different view between Canada and the U.S. regarding the
legal regime of the passage (Canada maintains the position that these
waters are "internal" therefore fall under its jurisdiction, but the
U.S. maintains the high seas status respectively) \[25,26\]. Hinterland
connection is another setback; venturing transport through the northern
territories of Canada and Alaska has been characterized as the
logistical equivalent of a lunar landing \[27\]. The NWP is mainly
[regarded as an [alternative to the Panama Canal]{.mark}]{.underline},
though the investments on the latter to increase its size and crossing
speed will help maintain its competitiveness in the near future.
[Additionally, **[icebreaker services]{.mark}** in this area are
[extremely low both in **quantity** and **quality** compared to those
**offered by Russia**]{.mark} for the **[NSR]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[In addition to navigation challenges and lack of infrastructure and
response capabilities, coupled with the potential of unforeseen maritime
accidents and environmental disasters]{.underline}, there are
[looming]{.underline} energy, infrastructure, and [geopolitical
ambitions amongst many countries]{.underline} with a vested interest in
the region (Figure 2). For many countries, the [[Arctic presents an
**investment opportunity** to elevate]{.mark} their [strategic and
**economic significance**]{.mark} as well as boost their international
status]{.underline}. Russia, the United States, Canada, Denmark, and
Norway have all been trying to assert jurisdiction over part of the
Arctic. In fact, Denmark, Canada, Norway, and Russia have already made
submissions in relation to the Arctic seabed to the United Nations
Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS), which was
established by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
\[28\]. Recently, in August of 2015, Russia resubmitted a bid to the
CLCS claiming vast territories in the Arctic, specifically laying claim
to 1.2 million square kilometers (km) of sea shelf extending more than
350 nautical miles from the shore \[29\].

Furthermore, [[for]{.mark} these countries [claiming a presence]{.mark}
in Arctic developments, it is [**imperative** that a **prominent
maritime presence** is clearly established]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is
important to fully understand that [major technological
advances]{.underline} in overall safety systems onboard ships to
[include design and construction standards]{.underline} and navigational
aids and equipment have renewed the interest of both Canada and the
United States regarding the benefits associated with the NWP \[30\].
Canada maintains the position that the NWP, especially those areas in
the Arctic Archipelago, are internal waters to Canada and should be
provided with the right to prohibit transit \[23\]. This interpretation
is not held by most maritime nations, including the United States and a
certain number of European Union's member-states that consider the NWP
as an international strait according to the description outlined in the
1982 United Nations Law of the Sea Convention \[28\]. This distinction
is incredibly important because applying the UNCLOS provisions limits
Canada's rights to enact fishing and environmental regulations, fiscal
and smuggling laws, shipping safety laws, but leaves the passage as an
international strait open to all nations \[31\].

NWP = Northwest passage

The Arctic Ocean is an area of approximately 14 million square
kilometers and is confined by landmasses of Norway, Greenland, Canada,
the United States, and Russia. Connection to the Pacific Ocean is
through the Bering Strait and to the Atlantic Ocean predominately
through the Greenland and Barents Sea. For the purposes of this section,
the focus will be on the two main routes connecting the Pacific Ocean
and the Atlantic Ocean.

The [**Northeast Passage** (NEP) connects the Atlantic and Pacific
Oceans through the eastern part of the Arctic Ocean]{.underline}; its
boundaries [are extending from Novaya Zemlya (west) to the Bering Strait
(east)]{.underline}. Its [significance lies in its potential as an
**alternative** to the **Suez Canal Route**]{.underline}, [making the
distance travelled between Asia and Europe around **40% shorter**
compared to crossing the Indian Ocean]{.underline}. [A portion of the
NEP]{.underline} along the northern Russian coastline and Norway, called
the NSR, has so far [attracted the greatest majority of the Arctic
maritime traffic]{.underline}. In 1932, the Council of People's
Commission of the [USSR **formally asserted** it as a **legal entity**
under **Russian jurisdiction**]{.underline} \[20[\]. It is important to
note that [in order to **increase** ]{.mark}**the
[attractiveness]{.mark}** [of the **NSR**]{.mark}, the
**[Russia]{.mark}**n authorities have [committed to provide]{.mark} the
**required icebreaker support** and SAR response [year-round]{.mark}
through the **Marine Rescue Coordination Center**]{.underline} in
Dikson, Northern Russia, with additional support during the months of
July through October from the two allocated marine rescue sub-centers of
Tiksi and Pevek \[14\]. [Russia currently advertises the **[support of
five icebreakers]{.mark}**, two of which possess diving equipment and
oil spill response equipment [along the NSR]{.mark}]{.underline} \[2\].

On the western edge of the Arctic Ocean, [**[the NWP]{.mark}** runs
between Greenland and Newfoundland in the Atlantic Ocean]{.underline},
and along the northern coast of Canada and Alaska, ending in the Bering
Strait. The NWP [[links the **Atlantic** and **Pacific**
Oceans]{.mark}]{.underline} through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The
route [is [9000 km **shorter** than the **Panama Canal** ]{.mark}transit
[and 17,000 km shorter than]{.mark} the **[Cape Horn
]{.mark}**]{.underline}route \[21\]. The NWP route classification has
been categorized by Donat Pharand in his book under the title "The
Arctic Waters and the Northwest Passage: A Final Revisit" as a
compilation of seven possible routes through the Canadian Arctic. [The
west is comprised of [three feasible paths]{.mark}: The [M'Clure
Strait]{.mark}, the Prince of Wales Strait and the Peel
Sound.]{.underline} In the East, the passage is traditionally limited to
the Lancaster Sound \[22\]. The Beaufort Sea region generally becomes
ice free in August-September, while [in [most years]{.mark} the
[M'Clure]{.mark} Strait is prone to being [blocked by Old
Ice]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}(OI) \[23\].

The next section will further elaborate on the
[[NWP]{.mark},]{.underline} taking into account that this route is
[[increasingly **sea ice-free**]{.underline}]{.mark} as a result of
unprecedented sea ice loss, with increased vessel traffic expected by
midcentury \[15\]. [[Despite]{.mark} the [increasing ice-free state of
routes along the NWP]{.mark},]{.underline} a further analysis of the
different routes and potential choke points will occur, including their
viability to support maritime activities in the future, and the
[continued [need for **ice-breaking assets**]{.mark} as a result of the
potential marine hazards that will [still arise]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}because of the rapid rate at which sea ice is dissolving. [This
[**rapid thawing**]{.mark} will [give way to the increased likelihood of
**hull penetrating**]{.mark}, high-latitude multiyear **[ice]{.mark}**
(MYI[) flowing into the NWP shipping lanes]{.mark} \[24\].]{.underline}

[[Maritime trade]{.mark} channels [**essential** for America's
globalized economy]{.mark} lie in the crossfire of security
threats]{.underline}. Examples abound: in the Middle East, Iran has
seized ships passing through the Strait of Hormuz and has employed
Houthi rebels as proxies in the Bab el-Mandeb Strait to target
commercial vessels and disrupt trade. The Suez Canal is threatened by
the spillover of regional instability with the Israel-Hamas war, while
the Strait of Malacca is dominated and increasingly militarized by
Beijing. The common denominator is clear: [global trade routes are under
siege and the United States must look for feasible
alternatives.]{.underline}

[[The United States may turn its attention to the]{.mark} North for
alternative trade routes: The Northern Sea Route ([NSR) and]{.mark}
Northwest Passage ([NWP]{.mark}).]{.underline} These trade routes are
gaining strategic relevance with the ever faster recession of the Arctic
ice shield. [The United States is an Arctic power; its direct access to
the region and national security objectives in the Arctic give the
United States a say in the region's future. However, when it comes to
the NSR and NWP, passages used and administered by Russia and Canada,
the U.S. is dependent on international cooperation and can only access
the existing Arctic trade routes through international
partnerships.]{.underline} While these routes are already faster than
the Suez or Panama Canal, ice melt from global warming will open an even
more efficient Transpolar Sea Route (TSR) by mid-century. [[This
presents a **unique geostrategic opportunity**]{.mark}, for which many
nations will compete. [The United States must enter this competition and
seek to capitalize on the **economic potential** of trans-polar
trade.]{.mark} Russia already has a formidable military presence in the
region and has a major economic and strategic interest in the TSR.
[Moscow continues to push military capabilities]{.mark} closer to the
North Pole, [laying claim to the TSR]{.mark} before it opens up ice-free
for international use in the next few decades.]{.underline}

[The threat of Russia cutting off the United States from the TSR is an
economic, strategic, and security challenge that has received too little
attention in Washington, DC[. If the United States does not stifle
encroaching Russian influence in the region now, it might **lose its
freedom of commercial navigation** in the TSR]{.mark} when it opens up
in the 2040s -- the current best estimate, based on the trajectory of
ice melting.]{.underline}

The United States can shape its engagement in the region in several
ways, however each strategy will have trade-offs. Broadly speaking, the
U.S. may have three objectives in the region: (1) the avoidance of
conflict with, and, where possible, cooperation with Russia, (2)
economic dominance of the TSR, and (3) greater military presence near
the TSR. [Between three possible outcomes and combinations thereof, only
two are ever attainable, with the third always becoming a casualty. The
U.S. thus faces an **Arctic Trilemma**. ..]{.underline}

What is the way forward? [I argue that the [United States must embrace
Great Power Competition and contain Russia's ambitions in the Arctic by
pursuing (2) economic dominance of and (3) military presence in the
TSR]{.mark}. [The United States must secure]{.mark} [dominance]{.mark}
of the TSR through military command of the sea, and restructure military
plans on the strategic, operational, [and]{.mark} tactical levels to
**[contest Russian hegemony in the Arctic.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Regulation of the oceans, which cover over 70 per cent of the earth's
surface and are the lifeline of the global economy is as much a
necessity as a challenge. The [[maritime domain]{.mark}
has]{.underline}, in many ways, [[shaped]{.mark} the [**destiny**
of]{.mark} the **[world]{.mark}**]{.underline} and has been instrumental
in orchestrating the rise and fall of great powers. From the time of the
Peloponnesian War to the current emerging great power rivalry brewing in
the Indo-Pacific, domination of the oceans remains the key to global
power. [Cooperation is giving way to **competition** and the global
[**commons** are under **stress**]{.mark} from multiple
**pressures**]{.underline} and interests [leading to an **unstable**
maritime environment]{.underline}. Hence, the importance of a
[**[robust]{.mark}** regulatory [mechanism]{.mark}]{.underline} and a
collective approach [to ensure]{.underline} the
**[security]{.underline}** of the maritime domain needs little emphasis
and [[is]{.mark} an inescapable **[imperative]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
the uncertain world that we live in.

The seas are regarded as the "common heritage of mankind", a term coined
in 1967 by Arvid Pardo, the Maltese Ambassador to the United Nations
(UN), and therefore need to be regulated and controlled.1 While land
borders divide, the seas unite. Ever since man ventured into the high
seas, they have been the maritime highways over which commerce and
energy have travelled across the globe. In this era of globalization,
connectivity and **[trade]{.underline}** dependencies, which transcend
cartographic geographies, this [is happening **more than
ever**]{.underline} before. [[With]{.underline}]{.mark} the burgeoning
global population and the rapid [[**depletion** of]{.mark} land
**[resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [the [seas are becoming]{.mark} the
source for the **[future]{.mark}**]{.underline} sustenance and
development [[of **humankind**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The seamless
expanse of the oceans therefore not only offers vast opportunities but
also gives rise to numerous challenges in the maritime domain with
security being one of them. The wide spectrum of contemporary maritime
security challenges makes it impossible for any one nation to address
these. A multilayered, multi- dimensional and multinational approach to
ensure adherence to an established inter- national **[rules-based
[order]{.mark}]{.underline}** and compliance with laid-down laws and
conventions [[is]{.mark} therefore [**the key** to protecting]{.mark}
this **critical [resource]{.mark}**]{.underline} for the future.

\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS END\>\>

Maritime governance over the centuries has been driven by geopolitical
power rivalry, economic imperatives, hegemonistic ambitions and various
other factors which have shaped both, cooperation and competition.
However, the underlying conviction that the open seas are for everybody
to use has endured. The contemporary maritime environment is governed by
the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which is in
its third iteration (UNCLOS III) since it was first codified in 1958
under the aegis of the UN. UNCLOS primarily defines the extent of
sovereign maritime boundaries while respecting the principle of "mare
liberum" which can be defined as "the sea is open to all nations". This
was first propagated by the famous Dutch lawyer Hugo Grotius in 1608,
primarily to argue for the free and unhindered passage of Dutch ships to
the Dutch East Indies and to counter the influence of the Church to some
extent.2 Historical perspective Grotius was challenged by an English
lawyer John Selden, articulating mare clausum (1635), who suggested that
seas contiguous to the coastline of a country should be under the
dominion of that country and were a reflection of his country's views.3
Such arguments eventually led to the introduction of territorial waters.
However, it was the Grotian view that ultimately prevailed and became
the basis for marine governance of that period. The first attempt at
ownership of the sea was expressed by Cornelius van Bynkershoek, a Dutch
lawyer who believed that states should have a limited right to own and
occupy some sea space and propagated the "cannon-shot rule". In his
view, ownership of the sea was possible only as far as "the cannon will
carry". This soon became the accepted norm4 and became the basis for the
three mile limit being legiti- mately accepted as the extent of the
territorial sea. Limited ownership of the sea also suited the large
maritime powers who, were thus able to dominate, control, and travel
over vast portions of the sea for trade and in pursuit of dominion. The
nineteenth century witnessed a series of transformational events that
altered the global approach to the maritime domain and continue to
influence the governance of the oceans even today. The opening of the
Suez Canal in 1869 immediately reduced the navigable distance by almost
4,000 miles for ships travel- ling across the oceans. The regulations
governing the use of the Suez Canal were enshrined in the Constantinople
Convention signed on October 29, 1888. Its Article 1 defined that it
will always be free and open for navigation "without distinction of
flag" in times of war and peace and further stipulated that it "shall
never be subjected to the exercise of the right of blockade".5 In 1866,
the first undersea cable was successfully laid between Ireland and
Newfound- land. While protection of these cables was a concern, which
led to the 1884 Convention for the Protection of Submarine Cables6, the
freedom to lay cables in the high seas was never questioned or
challenged. It was during this period that curiosity about the maritime
domain led to the beginning of marine research. A converted Royal Navy
corvette, HMS Challenger, undertook an expedition between 1872 and 1876.
It covered over 68,000 miles and collected exten- sive data besides
various types of marine flora, fauna and objects which included ferro-
manganic nodules. It discovered the Marianas Trench (26,850 feet deep),
the Challenger Deep (37,800 feet and the deepest point of the ocean) and
the rise in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, now called the
Mid-Atlantic Ridge.7 Oceanographic research picked up pace and soon all
major maritime powers began undertaking expeditions to unravel the
mysteries of the deep. In the 1870s, the introduction of steam powered
fishing trawlers led to fishing far from home. While this did lead to
concerns of overfishing, the majority view was that the abundance of
fish in the ocean would preclude that from ever happening. Towards the
end of the nineteenth century, offshore oil exploration also made humble
beginnings. The Industrial Revolution and the transition from sail to
steam effected a remarkable transformation in the global maritime
landscape and the spirit of human endeavour began to have an impact on
the oceans in many ways. This also led to greater effort at regulation
and organisation of the maritime space. The sinking of the liners
Lusitania and Athenia by German U-boats in World Wars I and II,
respectively, sent shock waves through the maritime community.
Unrestricted submarine warfare -- first by Germany against the Allied
forces and later, by the United States (US) against Japan -- had rudely
violated the freedom of the open sea. In 1930, the League of Nations
Codification Conference was held at The Hague. It was unsuccessful in
addressing the issue of territorial waters, except for certain draft
articles that were accepted by governments to a limited extent.8 These
major developments in the maritime domain and the efforts to address the
security and economic risks arising from them were addressed
periodically, but regulation in this domain continued to be
inconsistent. The evolution of UNCLOS The requirement of a regulatory
framework to govern the world's oceans and establish a uniform limit of
sovereign maritime boundaries towards mitigating the occurrence of
maritime territorial disputes as also to protecting and conserving the
marine environ- ment was felt after World War II as nations began
advancing their territorial claims further seawards from the commonly
accepted three-mile limit. In 1945, President Woodrow Wilson extended
the US's territorial sea rights up to the extent of its continental
shelf. Many countries followed suit by fixing different limits; Chile,
Ecuador and Peru declared a 200-mile zone as their territorial sea to
protect their fishing rights.9 Work on a uniform global framework began
in 1949. The International Law Commis- sion prepared four draft
conventions. This led to the First conference on the Law of the Sea
(UNCLOS I) being held in 1956, and resulted in four treaties being
concluded at Geneva between February 24 and April 29, 1958. These were
the Convention on Terri- torial Seas and Contiguous Zones, the
Convention on the Continental Shelf, the Conven- tion on the High Seas
and the Convention on Fishing and Conservation of Living Resources on
the High Seas. These ultimately came into force between September 30,
1962 and March 20, 1966.10 However, there were still unresolved issues
such as a decision on the maximum breadth of the sea. This could not be
established even at the Second Conference (UNCLOS II) held at Geneva
from March 17 to April 26, 1960. Held over a duration of six weeks in
the shadow of the bipolar Cold War world order, it did not result in any
new agreements. The Third Conference (UNCLOS III) was held in New York.
More than 160 countries participated in the discussions, which continued
from 1973 to 1982. The Convention was signed on December 10, 1982 at
Montego Bay in Jamaica and finally came into force on November 16, 1994
after Guyana became the 60th nation to ratify it. One hundred and
sixty-eight parties comprising 164 UN member states and four others --
Palestine (UN Observer State), the Cook Islands, Niue, and the European
Union (EU) as a separate entity have now ratified it. It is a completely
binding document and comprises 17 parts, 320 articles and nine annexures
and clearly defines maritime zones, namely, the baseline, the
territorial waters, the contiguous zone, the exclusive economic zone
(EEZ), the continental shelf, the international seabed area, and
archipelagic waters.11 The UNCLOS has been described variously as "the
strongest comprehensive global environment treaty negotiated todate"12
but has also faced criticism for not being effective enough. The world's
leading maritime power, the US has not ratified it: initially for its
disagreement on deep seabed mining and subsequently, because of various
reasons, including sovereignty issues.13 China, on the other hand, has
ratified it but pays scant attention to its provisions when its own
interests are affected. Contradictions like these have an adverse impact
on maritime security in both, territorial waters and on the high seas.
As per the Convention, states have the jurisdiction and are free to
manage, develop and exploit all resources within the sea, the floor and
the subsoil within their EEZ; this has led to 38 million nautical square
miles of ocean and about 87 per cent of all known hydro- carbon reserves
coming under some sort of national jurisdiction.14 While UNCLOS has
demarcated coastal waters with the rights and privileges of states
clearly defined, similar regulation governing the areas beyond national
jurisdiction (ABNJ), which constitute 64 per cent of the world's ocean
space is presently inadequate for the conservation and sustainable use
of this medium. Irresponsible exploitation of the open seas is rarely
checked even by flag states who not only often turn a blind eye towards
their own agencies indulging in this but in a few cases even support it.
The unchecked depredation of marine resources and the destruction of
biodiversity in the ABNJ because of the concept of open seas is a matter
of concern and a maritime security chal- lenge. Open ocean governance
has been addressed to some extent by the formation of the International
Seabed Authority (ISA) as a distinct institutional mechanism to deal
with those maritime areas, which are not owned by states. However, the
efficacy, or lack of it of the ISA highlights the difficulties of
regulating the open oceans which have been described by some as
"characterized by anarchy".15 Besides the ISA, UNCLOS has also led to
the development of other important conventions governing different
aspects related to the oceans and maritime security, including the
International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), the International
Whaling Commission, and the International Union for Conservation of
Nature (IUCN), amongst others. Its limitations notwithstanding, UNCLOS
has been successful in ensuring adherence to a framework that has stood
the test of time in mitigating tensions over maritime spaces and
improved the protective environment for the conservation and responsible
exploitation of marine resources. The preamble of the Convention states
its aim of settling "all issues relating to the law of the sea" and is
"conscious that the problems of ocean space are closely interrelated and
need to be considered as a whole".16 It also takes into account that
without compromising sovereignty, it will "promote the peaceful uses of
the seas and the oceans, the equitable and efficient utilization of
their resources, the conservation of their living resources, and the
study, protection and preservation of the marine environment".17 Hence,
in a nutshell, the UNCLOS provides an inclusive legal framework which
respects sovereign waters while encouraging a cooperative approach
towards the exploi- tation of the oceans as a global common. As the
importance of the maritime domain increases and it increasingly becomes
the source for future global sustenance, so will the importance of
UNCLOS for addressing the emerging competition and contestation on, for,
and from the sea. Changing nature of the maritime threat

\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS BEGIN\>\>

One of the objectives of a universally accepted legal
[framework]{.underline} is to [**resolve** tension amongst nations
over]{.underline} maritime [**disputes** and]{.underline} to
**[mitigate]{.underline}** emerging [security challenges]{.underline}.
Ocean governance remains a serious challenge. Nations continue to feud
over control of their common waters with these disputes often leading to
dangerous brinkmanship and potential escalation. The nature of the
maritime threat has also evolved over time and is undergoing a distinct
transition from the primacy of kinetic state-on-state conflict, which is
the raison d'être of navies the world over, towards a wider spectrum of
challenges which threaten the peaceful use of the sea. These threats
extend across the strategic, operational, tactical and sub-conventional
domains thus requiring different prevention and response strategies.
Concepts such as **[[gunboat diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
less-than-war situations or the threat of
**[[blockades]{.underline}]{.mark}** and other coercive measures have
given way to more contemporary hybrid warfare and grey zone tactics,
which, as the very name suggests is a nebulous state between war and
peace with the potential to [[provoke]{.underline}]{.mark} an unintended
**[[escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The term "maritime security" has itself undergone a paradigm shift and
is no longer restricted within the narrow confines of the commonly
understood meaning of the word "security". The maritime domain is
inextricably linked to national and international political, economic,
legal and societal [issues]{.underline} each of which not only has an
[impact]{.underline} on maritime security but in the larger context, on
**[humankind]{.underline}** as well. [[Tackling]{.underline}]{.mark} the
emerging [[**existential** challenge]{.mark} posed [by]{.mark} the
effects of [**climate change** or]{.mark}]{.underline} developing a
[sustainable **Blue [Economy]{.mark}** model]{.underline} are also
intrinsic to ensuring maritime security.

Further, the current uncertainty in the global order and numerous
trouble spots across the world have resulted in a host of
non-traditional and transnational security challenges in the maritime
domain. Undersea communication [[**cables** are under threat]{.mark} of
being damaged]{.underline} by inimical forces;
**[[piracy]{.underline}]{.mark}** and armed robbery [remains a live
**threat**]{.underline} and rears its ugly head in different parts of
the world on a regular basis; [**[insurgencies]{.mark}** are
[spreading]{.mark} into]{.underline} the [**maritime**
domain]{.underline} with the lethality and intensity of the attacks
increasing by the day with the active involvement of state and
state-supported elements. The spectre of maritime
[**[terrorism]{.mark}** is omni[present]{.mark}]{.underline}; human
rights at sea are often called into question; [[**fishing**
stocks]{.mark} the world over are [depleting]{.mark}]{.underline}
rapidly; the [melting of **glaciers**]{.underline} and the polar ice cap
is accelerating global warming; the [**[acidification]{.mark}** of the
oceans is [on]{.mark} the [rise]{.mark}]{.underline}; the effects of
seabed mining on the fragile marine ecosystem are yet to be fully
understood and the quest for maritime domination is leading to a
competitive and confrontational maritime environment. The governance
deficit in certain countries and regions due to political instability,
internecine conflict, internal insurgencies, separatist movements and
economic deprivation makes them vulnerable to exploitation by inimical
external forces. These are further exacerbated by the [increasing
frequency of **natural disasters**]{.underline} caused due to the
effects of climate change that render large sections of coastal
communities destitute and robbed of livelihoods besides the loss of life
and property.

Transnational dimension

About [[**90 per cent** of]{.mark} global [trade
transits]{.mark}]{.underline} over the sea [[on]{.underline}]{.mark}
more than 50,000 **[[ships]{.underline}]{.mark}**.18 The volume of
global trade in 2020--21 was 10.6 billion tonnes despite the slump
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.19 In 2020, 131 countries imported crude
oil worth more than US\$ 709 billion,20 which travelled on huge tankers
across geographies. In this age of transcontinental connectivity, the
economic fall-out of the COVID-19 **[pandemic]{.underline}** exposed the
vulnerability of the global **[supply chains]{.underline}**, thereby
leading to a renewed thrust on ensuring their resilience. Hence, the
safety and [[**security** of]{.mark} the global sea lines of
communication]{.underline} (**[[SLOCs]{.underline}]{.mark}**) and the
maintenance of good order at sea is critical to keep the wheels of the
global economy rotating smoothly. This [will **[only]{.mark} be**
[possible with]{.mark} a [**collective** approach]{.mark} to maritime
**security**]{.underline}.

Perhaps the most recent and prominent example of a successful collective
approach to maritime security was the response to the scourge of piracy
off the coast of Somalia in the Horn of Africa. It took a coordinated
approach by powerful warships of more than 20 navies bristling with
weapons and sensors, from all over the world, almost four years to quell
this menace that was posed by groups of young "pirates" brandishing
AK-47s and a sense of bravado travelling in small skiffs who were able
to hold global trade to ransom. This was obviously part of a larger
political and economic mess created by a failed state with a severe
governance deficit, but containing it at sea required an effort that was
grossly disproportionate to the menace. Such is the nature of the
asymmetric sub-conventional threat. Piracy is just one of many
transnational threats; the uncertain world we live in has many more.
That many of these are state-sponsored makes this even more
disconcerting.

While the threat of piracy is localised and tactical in nature, the more
[**insidious [threat]{.mark}** is one that [comes
from]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**strategic** intent of [nations seeking
to **reshape**]{.mark} the **[existing]{.mark}** rules-based
[order]{.mark}]{.underline} and [[staking
**illegal**]{.underline}]{.mark} hegemonistic [[claims to]{.mark} the
**global [commons]{.mark}** in pursuit of their global
**ambitions**]{.underline}. In the last two decades, China's maritime
belligerence in the East China Sea, its territorial claim over
approximately 80 per cent of the South China Sea enclosed within the
Nine-Dash Line based on some dubious historical claim, and its active
support to all manner of illegal activity at sea has raised regional
con- cerns across the Indo-Pacific. China has reclaimed various features
in the South China Sea and is claiming these as islands inspite of many
of these not conforming to the definition given in UNCLOS.21 Also,
despite reassurances to the contrary, it is actively militarising these
islands with the deployment of missile batteries and the frequent move-
ment of military aircraft, all of which pose a serious challenge to the
freedom of the seas and a Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP).22

\"[[History is **littered with examples** of trade disputes
escalating]{.mark} into armed conflict]{.underline},\" says the website
of the World Trade Organization, which was set up after World War II in
part to avoid a repeat of the pre-war trade tensions. \"It\'s a claim
that should not be exaggerated, but [there is **truth** in
it.\"]{.underline}

[Will U[.S. and China Fight]{.mark}]{.underline}?

As in the case of the once dominant United States and rapidly

hostilities to come as a cause of them.]{.underline}

\"It is **[[easier to find]{.mark} example of [wars leading to trade

Institute, 4/22/2025, \"A Response to China-Russia Arctic Dominance
Could Bolster US-Canada Ties\", Hudson Institute,

:)

To counter this cooperation, [the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[should]{.mark} **consider [work]{.mark}ing [with]{.mark} its
[Canad]{.mark}i[a]{.mark}n allies** [to]{.mark} open and
[maintain]{.mark} an equivalent [shipping]{.mark} route]{.underline} ---
an "Ice Canal" across the Northwest Passage --- [to [bolster]{.mark}
their commercial and strategic [presence]{.mark} in the
region.]{.underline}

All-year-round shipping through the Arctic would require significant
infrastructure and promises high costs for fuel, equipment, and
manpower. [But these [invest]{.mark}ments [would **generate**]{.mark}
**considerable economic [returns]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The
**[N]{.mark}orth[w]{.mark}est [P]{.mark}assage** can [reduce
shipping]{.mark} distance between London and Tokyo [by about]{.mark}
**3,780 nautical miles**, or approximately **[7,000
kilometers]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [And the priceless strategic benefits
of [bolster]{.mark}ing [U.S. and allied]{.mark} nuclear security should
incentivize **public [cooperation with]{.mark} the [private]{.mark}
sector**, defraying costs further]{.underline}.

Moscow and Beijing recognize the region's significance. Their agreement
involves building five ice-class container ships and investing in
infrastructure such as deep-water ports and refueling and repair
facilities along the Northern Sea Route along Russia's Arctic coastline.
These container ships are dual-use, meaning they can be used for
commercial purposes and military sealift operations such as weapons
systems and troop transport. The initiative signals that Russia and
China prioritize regional mobility, allowing them to cooperate on
increasing the profitability of Russia's Arctic coastline and on
strategic interoperability across the region.

[A competing **[dual-use project]{.mark}**, led by the **U.S. and
Canada**, would [help engage **Japan**]{.mark}**, [So]{.mark}uth
[Ko]{.mark}rea**, [and]{.mark} other Arctic **[NATO]{.mark} allies**
[in]{.mark} strategic and economic [coop]{.mark}eration across the
region]{.underline}.

The first step to opening this route is to find out what we do not know.
[Because very few people have been to the [N]{.mark}orth[w]{.mark}est
[P]{.mark}assage in winter, assessments are largely [based on
theoretical]{.mark} models and historical and satellite
[data]{.mark}]{.underline}. [These means of **data collection [are
insufficient]{.mark}** [to create]{.mark} a reliable and detailed
[map]{.mark} of the geographical and seasonal shipping
challenges]{.underline}. [Shipping along the Northwest Passage will
[require]{.mark} initial [efforts]{.mark} to map sea ice movements and
wind patterns [throughout the year]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[**[Canada has 20 vessels]{.mark}** in its icebreaker fleet, two of
which are heavy icebreakers]{.underline}. These are expected to be
replaced with two new polar vessels capable of operating in moderate
multiyear ice conditions in 2030. [[To]{.mark} [complement]{.mark}
research, approximately five years of all-year-round
**[icebreaker]{.mark} pre[s]{.mark}ence is [needed]{.mark} to map the
geographical locations and timing** of choke points created by multiyear
ice and wind patterns]{.underline}.

[The [data collected]{.mark} by the icebreaker presence will be [used to
identify locations for]{.mark} deploying unmanned aerial vehicles or
helicopters [supplyi]{.mark}ng [ice]{.mark} [and]{.mark} weather [data
to]{.mark} vessels and [aircraft]{.mark} transiting the Northwest
Passage]{.underline}. **[Icebreakers [will be on call]{.mark} [all
year]{.mark} round to assist vessels transiting ice choke
points]{.underline}**. [This would **[allow for safe]{.mark}
all-year-round [passage]{.mark}** of container ships and **[give]{.mark}
U.S. and Canadian forces [invaluable]{.mark} real-world [experience
operating jointly]{.mark}** and across domains in Arctic
conditions]{.underline}.

Additionally, [a permanent Western presence along the Northwest Passage
would [give U.S. and allie]{.mark}d militarie[s]{.mark}
**[invaluable]{.mark} situational [awareness]{.mark}** [and the ability
to respond swiftly]{.mark} to the outbreak of conflict in critical
strategic areas]{.underline}. This is particularly important because the
shortest routes for Russian intercontinental ballistic missiles are
through the poorly surveilled airspace north of the Arctic Circle.

Yet, as we make our way into 2025, [it's [hard to reconcile]{.mark} that
**[spirit of coop]{.mark}eration** [with]{.mark} the [current]{.mark}
trajectory of U.S.-Canada [relations]{.mark}, marred [by]{.mark} threats
of protectionist [policies]{.mark} based on a misapprehension of the
mutual benefits that come from trade]{.underline}.

[Back in 2001, our primary concern was managing the extra security
measures at the border. Long lineups of trucks at border crossings added
cost and frustration, harming productivity and adding
costs.]{.underline}

When meeting with legislators throughout the Pacific Northwest and in
Washington D.C., my message was consistent: "Don't let Osama bin Laden
succeed beyond his wildest dreams by permanently disrupting the most
successful trade and strategic alliance the world has ever seen." That
resonated.

[A permanent thickening of the border --- costing billions in lost
productivity and thousands of jobs --- was seen as something to be
avoided]{.underline}.

[By 2002]{.underline}, [the [NEXUS]{.mark} program [was launched]{.mark}
to allow pre-approved, low-risk travellers expedited processing at land,
air, and marine border crossings between Canada and the United
States]{.underline}. [It [has **enhanced security** while **facilitating
trade**]{.mark} **and travel** for trusted individuals]{.underline}.

Fast forward to today, and we face a starkly different reality. The
current U.S. administration's threats to intentionally disrupt its
economic relationship with Canada are not born of international security
concerns but of deliberate policy choices. The idea of antagonizing your
closest ally --- one of your largest trading partners and one of your
most reliable strategic collaborators --- would have been unthinkable
two decades ago.

Yet here we are.

Back in 2002, our counterargument to protectionist tendencies in U.S.
states like Montana --- where forestry and agriculture were often
contentious issues --- was simple: "Don't give the terrorists a win."
The legislators understood. They saw the value in preserving the flow of
legitimate trade and travel, ensuring that the security measures taken
post-9/11 didn't damage our mutual prosperity.

[Today, the stakes have evolved. Beyond the shared mission of keeping
borders safe, there is a [pressing]{.mark} need to address the
[**critical energy relationship** between]{.mark} the U.S. and Canada,
particularly on the West Coast of [North America]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[This partnership is deeply intertwined, with natural [gas and
electricity playing pivotal roles in]{.mark} sustaining the region's
economic and environmental [goals]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[**[B.C. used to be]{.mark} a net [exporter of]{.mark}
[hydro]{.mark}electricity** to the United States, providing help to
California 25 years ago]{.underline}. However, in recent years,
[[reduced]{.mark} electricity [generation]{.mark} has [forced]{.mark}
B.C. Hydro [to import]{.mark} record amounts of electricity to meet our
domestic demand, equal to almost two Site C dams worth of power in both
2023 and 2024]{.underline}. [This shift **[underscores]{.mark} the
[interdependence]{.mark} of our energy systems** [and]{.mark} the
[benefits of]{.mark} maintaining a strong, [coop]{.mark}erative
relationship]{.underline}.

[B.C. natural [gas]{.mark}, [another cornerstone]{.mark} of the
Canada-U.S. energy trade, flows freely across the border, fuelling
industries and homes on both sides]{.underline}. [The seamless exchange
of these resources not only **[supports]{.mark} economic growth** [but
also]{.mark} enhances **[energy security]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[Disrupting]{.mark} this [flow]{.mark} through tariffs or other trade
barriers would **harm both nations** and [**create vulnerabilities**
that]{.mark} adversaries could exploit]{.underline}.

[Adversaries like **[China]{.mark}**, **[Russia]{.mark}**,
**[No]{.mark}**rth **[Ko]{.mark}**rea, [and]{.mark} even
**[Iran]{.mark}** are [watch]{.mark}ing closely, likely with a sense of
satisfaction]{.underline}. [They **won't need to lift a finger** if the
United States and other western countries are at odds with each
other]{.underline}.

The implications are profound. The thickening of the border --- if it is
allowed to happen with tariffs --- jeopardizes billions of dollars in
trade. Strategically, it would represent a weakening of one of the very
alliances that have underpinned global stability for decades. And
diplomatically, it sends a message to the world that the bonds between
the U.S. and its allies are not as strong as they once were.

[The upside-down world we find ourselves in is not just a loss for
Canada and the U.S. It [represents a loss for]{.mark} all who benefit
from a **stable, cooperative [global order]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

As we navigate this new era, we must remember the lessons of the past:
[the **strength and security of western [democracies rely on]{.mark}
[collab]{.mark}oration and cooperation [between allies]{.mark}**, not
counterproductive conflict]{.underline}. [And we [must recognize]{.mark}
the enduring [importance of]{.mark} our shared [energy]{.mark} future,
which remains [a **cornerstone of**]{.mark} **the West Coast's
prosperity and [resilience]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[A world dominated by totalitarian states would be]{.underline}]{.mark}
more incompetent, [[more war-prone]{.mark}, less
cooperative]{.underline}, and more inhibitive of progress [[than]{.mark}
one dominated by [democratic states]{.mark}]{.underline}. Our current
world is not particularly competent, peaceful, cooperative, or
progressive---a totalitarian-dominated world would be worse. [[It would
increase the risk of]{.mark} another [collapse and
extinction]{.mark}]{.underline} and could shape the future toward less
desirable trajectories (Beckstead, 2013).

[Totalitarian states are incompetent. They are bad at forecasting and
dealing with disasters]{.underline} (Caplan, 2008).16 This can be seen
most clearly in the great famines of Communist China and the USSR, in
which millions died (Applebaum, 2017; Becker, 1996; Dikötter, 2010;
Snyder, 2010). In comparison, functioning multiparty democracies rarely,
if ever, experience famines (Sen, 2010). "Established autocracies" (or
"personal"/"sultanist") are particularly bad, as there are few checks or
restraints on arbitrary rule and the whims and ideology of the single
individual, even from other elites (Svolik, 2012). From the inside, the
"inner circle" around Mao, Stalin, and Hitler seems incredibly chaotic,
with elites strongly incentivized to conceal information and encouraged
by the autocrat to squabble and feud---so they are divided (Conquest,
1992; Kershaw, 2008; Zhang & Halliday, 2006). If totalitarian states are
worse at addressing social, environmental, and technological problems,
then a world dominated by them would likely be worse at responding to
risks of collapse and extinction.

A world dominated by totalitarian states is more likely to have major
wars. States with near-universal adult suffrage rarely (if ever) go to
war with one another (Barnhart et al., 2020), so [[a world dominated by
democracies has fewer wars]{.underline}.
[Miscalc]{.underline}]{.mark}[ulation [might be]{.mark}]{.underline}
[a]{.mark} particular [[problem for totalitarian states due to
personalization and disincentives for accurate
info]{.mark}rmation,]{.underline} leading to well-known strategic
disasters such as Hitler and Stalin's blunders in World War II (Bialer,
1970; Noakes & Pridham, 2001), or at a smaller level, Saddam Hussein's
rejection of diplomacy (Atkinson, 1993). [[War
makes]{.underline}]{.mark} collapse and [[extinction]{.mark} more
[likely, by]{.mark} raising the chance of [w]{.mark}eapons of
[m]{.mark}ass [d]{.mark}estruction [being used]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Linked to this, [[totalitarian states are less cooperative]{.mark} than
democratic states]{.underline}. While cooperation is possible (Ginsburg,
2020), [their [internal norms are characterized by
paranoia]{.mark}]{.underline} and treachery, and their lack of
transparency limits their ability to credibly commit to agreements.
[[This is bad for]{.mark} all [risks that require cooperation such
as]{.mark} [pandemics or climate change]{.mark}]{.underline} (Tomasik,
2015).

Finally, [continued social and [scientific progress is likely to reduce
risks of]{.mark}]{.underline} collapse and
[[extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}. Social progress could reduce global
inequality and other risk factors. [[Scientific progress could help
address natural risks and climate change]{.underline}]{.mark} (Sandberg,
2018), differentially increase defensive rather than offensive power
(Garfinkel & Dafoe, 2019), [[and solve safety challenges in AI or
biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology (Russell, 2019).
[[However,]{.underline}]{.mark} as we will now discuss [[totalitarian
states would likely inhibit social progress]{.underline}]{.mark}.

A central question from a longtermist perspective is: Which values
should shape the future? I would argue that we should prefer it to be
shaped by liberal democratic values. This is not to say that the current
democracy-dominated world is perfect---far from it. The fate of billions
of factory-farmed animals or hundreds of millions of people in extreme
poverty makes that abundantly clear. However, democracies have two
advantages. First, [democracies have space for cosmopolitan values such
as human rights, plurality, freedom, and equality. These are better than
those that characterize life under totalitarianism: Fear, terror,
subjection, and secrecy]{.underline}. Second, they have within
themselves the mechanism to allow progress. In the last 100 (or even 50)
years, the lives of women, LGBT people, religious minorities, and
non-white people have dramatically improved. Our "moral circle" has
expanded, and could continue to expand (Singer, 1981). The arc of the
moral universe is long, but given the right conditions, it might just
bend toward justice (King, 1968). A global society dominated by these
values, and with the possibility of improving more, has a better
longterm potential. [A totalitarian-dominated world,]{.underline} on the
other hand, [would reduce the space for resistance and
progress---distorting the human trajectory.]{.underline}

[We should be particularly concerned about "bottlenecks" at which values
are particularly important---where there is a risk of
"locking-in]{.underline}" [some]{.underline} particular set of (possibly
far from optimal) [values]{.underline}. While they are currently faroff,
[future technologies such as artificial general intelligence, space
settlement, life extension (of autocrats), or much better surveillance
could enable lock-in]{.underline} (Caplan, 2008).17

Conditional on them avoiding new catastrophes, world orders dominated by
totalitarians could be quite long-lasting (Caplan, 2008). Democracies
can undermine authoritarian and totalitarian regimes through the
following ways: Control, including conquest; contagion through
proximity; and consent, promoting receptivity toward democratization
(Whitehead, 2001). Democracies can actively undermine these regimes
through war, sanctions, hosting rebellious exiles, or sponsoring
internal movements. Passively, through contagion, they offer a
demonstration that a better, more prosperous life is possible. For
example, in the final years of the USSR, ordinary Soviet citizens were
able to see that the West had a higher standard of living---more
innovation, more choice, and more consumer goods. The elites were able
to read books from the outside, and travel---Gorbachev's contacts and
friendships with European politicians may have made him more favorable
to social democracy (Brown, 1996). Democracies can undermine the will
and capacity of the coercive apparatus (Bellin, 2004). However, in a
world not dominated by democracies, all these pressures would be far
less.

A world in which, say, totalitarian regimes emerged as dominant after
World War II (for example if the USA was defeated) could be
self-reinforcing and long-lasting, like the self-reinforcing
relationship of Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia (Orwell, 1949). Orwell's
fictional world is characterized by constant low-grade warfare to
justify emergency powers and secure elites, and with shifting alliances
of convenience as states bandwagon and balance, thereby preventing any
resolution. A totalitarian-dominated world order could be rather robust,
perhaps for decades or even centuries.

[[A]{.mark} long-lasting [totalitarian]{.mark}-dominated [world
would]{.mark} extend the period of time humanity would spend with a
heightened risk of collapse or extinction, as well as increased
potential for distortion of the human trajectory and the possibility
that a "[lock-in"]{.mark} event may occur]{.underline}. This example
illustrates the possibility of a "negative recovery," [[resulting in a
trajectory]{.underline} [with less or no scientific and social
progress]{.underline}]{.mark} [and a less favorable geopolitical
situation, [which would threaten the destruction of humanity]{.mark}'s
longterm potential]{.underline}.

#### Japan is refusing to bend the knee to Trump, destroying US-Japan cooperation

Scott **Foster 25**, journalist for the Asia Times, 5/19/25,"Japan not
rushing into a bad trade deal with Trump",
https://asiatimes.com/2025/05/japan-not-rushing-into-a-bad-trade-deal-with-trump//WF

[[Japan]{.mark}'s senior trade officials
**[skipped]{.mark}**]{.underline} the APEC Ministers Responsible for
**[[Trade meetings]{.underline}]{.mark}** held [[last
week]{.underline}]{.mark} on South Korea's Jeju Island.

Neither Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Yoji Muto nor Prime
Minister Shigeru Ishiba's top trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa attended
the event, [[**missing an opportunity** to talk]{.mark} [with
**US**]{.mark} **Trade** Representative Jamieson Greer]{.underline}.
Masaki Ogushi, a member of Akazawa's negotiating team, represented Japan
in their stead.

Unlike the UK, [[Japan is in **no hurry** to reach a]{.mark}
**disadvantageous** or incomplete **trade [deal]{.mark}**
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} US President Donald
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly [with
**elections**]{.underline} to the upper house of Japan's national
assembly [coming up in July]{.underline}. And unlike the South Koreans,
[[the Japanese are **not seeking**]{.mark} a low-key
**[compromise]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[[The **impact** of]{.mark} **25%** **[tariffs]{.mark}** on autos and
auto parts [on]{.mark} the [Japan]{.mark}ese economy
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} simply **[too [great]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
and [[America's]{.underline}]{.mark} **[renewed
[assault]{.mark}]{.underline}** [on]{.mark} Japan's [**rice
[farmers]{.mark}** [is too sensitive to
**tolerate**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Ishiba already leads a minority government, his Liberal Democratic Party
having lost its majority in the lower house last October. Now he must
either stand up for Japan or risk losing the party's majority in the
upper house as well.

Akazawa is expected to visit Washington, DC, for a third round of formal
negotiations later this month, perhaps within the coming week. While
Ogushi was in South Korea, he met with Chief Cabinet Secretary Hayashi
Yoshimasa to discuss strategy. After that meeting, he told the press,
"[My focus is on our national interests]{.underline}, to protect what
needs to be protected and to say what needs to be said."

Established in 1989 at the suggestion of Australian Prime Minister Bob
Hawke, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ([APEC]{.underline}) [describes
itself as "a cooperative, multilateral economic and trade
forum]{.underline}." Its 21 members include most of the economic
entities around the Pacific Ocean.

The People's Republic of China, Chinese Taipei and Hong Kong are all
members. In an unusual recognition of geographic reality, the Russian
Federation is also a member. North Korea is not.

[The complete list of members is]{.underline}: Australia, Brunei
Darussalam, Canada, Chile, People's Republic of China, Hong Kong,
Chinese Taipei, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New
Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore,
Thailand, **[the US]{.underline}** and Vietnam. APEC's mission is laid
out at this link.

On its website, APEC answers the question "What Does APEC Do?" with
"APEC ensures that goods, services, investment and people move easily
across borders." Except that it does not and cannot do so, because
"There are no binding commitments or treaty obligations. Commitments are
undertaken on a voluntary basis."

In principle, [[the US]{.underline},]{.mark} which now champions
protectionism, restrictions on investment, reversing the process of
economic integration and discouraging or forbidding economic and
technical cooperation, [[**no longer qualifies** for]{.mark} membership
in [APEC]{.mark}.]{.underline} But in practice, there is [**no
established procedure** for expulsion of a member who works in
opposition to the organization's mission]{.underline}.

According to some media reports, [Australia, Canada, Russia and
Singapore joined [Japan]{.mark} in not sending their most senior trade
representatives to Jeju, [implying **displeasure** with]{.mark} Donald
**[Trump's]{.mark}** combative **[protectionism]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
However, official announcements from the respective governments do not
support this view.

Regardless of what they think about Trump's extremely high tariffs and
belligerence, diplomacy prevailed and the 21 participants in the APEC
meetings issued a joint statement declaring that: "We remain committed
to the Putrajaya Vision 2040, including through the implementation of
the Aotearoa Plan of Action to build an open, dynamic, resilient, and
peaceful Asia-Pacific community for the prosperity of all our people and
future generations."

Putrajaya Vision 2040, endorsed by APEC leaders in 2020 in Malaysia,
aims "To ensure that the Asia-Pacific remains the world's most dynamic
and interconnected regional economy." To this end, APEC "will continue
to work together to deliver, a free, open, fair, non-discriminatory,
transparent and predictable trade and investment environment."

[[The Aotearoa Plan]{.underline}]{.mark}, announced in 2021 in New
Zealand, lays out specific actions to be taken in order to realized the
Putrajaya Vision, among them [promotion of a market-driven digital
economy, policies to support innovation, and support for "global efforts
to comprehensively address all environmental challenges, including
climate change, extreme weather and natural disasters, for a sustainable
planet."]{.underline}

This [[**aligns neither** with]{.mark} Trump's intent to
**[M]{.mark}**ake **[A]{.mark}**merica **[G]{.mark}**reat
**[A]{.mark}**gain [nor]{.mark} his [**withdrawal** from]{.mark} the
**[Paris]{.mark}** Agreement on climate change and roll-back of
environmental protection in the US.]{.underline} Washington, DC, is a
long way from Malaysia's Putrajaya and New Zealand's Aotearoa.

The joint statement issued in Jeju also notes that:

"We recognize the importance of the WTO to advance trade issues, and
acknowledge the agreed upon rules in the WTO as an integral part of the
global trading system. We recognize the WTO has challenges and needs
meaningful, necessary, and comprehensive reform to improve all its
functions, through innovative approaches, to be more relevant and
responsive in light of today's realities. We commend the efforts to
deepen discussions in the WTO on contemporary trade issues."

This may be interpreted as [indirectly addressing the US
complaint]{.underline}, which dates from the Obama administration, that
the WTO has allowed itself to be taken advantage of by China. But the
fact remains that the US has crippled the WTO by blocking appointments
to its appellate body, which now sits vacant. Furthermore, at the end of
March, it was reported that the Trump administration has put US funding
for the WTO under review.

This has allowed [[Japan to]{.mark} once again [assert]{.mark} itself as
a leading proponent of [free trade]{.mark}]{.underline}. On May 13,
Ishiba received a courtesy call from WTO Director-General Ngozi
Okonjo-Iweala on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the
establishment of the WTO. The Director-General "expressed her
expectation for the role of Japan as a champion of the multilateral
trading system" and both of them emphasized that "now is the time" to
unite and address the challenges facing the WTO.

During her working visit, Okonjo-Iweala also met with Japanese Foreign
Minister Takeshi Iwaya, Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and Economy,
Trade and Industry Minister Yoji Muto. Okonjo-Iweala and Iwaya issued a
joint statement declaring that "the value of the multilateral trading
system is unquestionable."

Fomer Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was instrumental in the
establishment of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for
Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), the trade agreement that replaced the
Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which collapsed after Trump abandoned
it in 2017. The CPTPP, which does not include China, took effect in
2018.

Japan has also played a leading role in Regional Comprehensive Economic
Partnership (RCEP), an exclusively Asia-Pacific trade agreement that
took effect in January 2022. RCEP does include China and may eventually
include India.

In Japan, the Constitutional Democratic Party, the country's largest
opposition party, is also a strong supporter of the multilateral trading
system. [There is a **[national consensus]{.mark}** supporting **free
trade** and **[opposing]{.mark}** its subversion by **[the US]{.mark}
government**.]{.underline}

#### Trump is willing to engage in strengthening trilateral relations.

Trump and US-Korea-Japan Trilateralism

[[Despite]{.mark} running [a campaign that questioned]{.mark} the value
of US [alliances]{.mark},]{.underline} [[the first Trump]{.underline}
[admin]{.underline}]{.mark}istration [[began]{.mark} working
toward]{.underline} **[[strengthening US relations with South Korea and
Japan]{.underline}]{.mark}** as early as 2017. During a trip to the
region, which included stops in Seoul and Tokyo, President Trump said he
"had the honor of sharing our vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific
--- a place where sovereign and independent nations...can all prosper
side-by-side, and thrive in freedom and in peace." His 2017 National
Security Strategy emphasized the Indo-Pacific region, committing to
"encourage the development of a strong defense network with our allies
and partners" such as South Korea and Japan. In 2019, the Trump
administration released its Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy,
adopting and advancing a regional concept that had been promoted by
Japanese Prime Minister Abe Shinzo for much of the 2010s. Other states,
including Korea and Japan, have released their own versions of an
Indo-Pacific strategy. While President-elect Trump is known to quickly
change his mind, these developments suggest it is unlikely he will
reverse course on the Indo-Pacific, where South Korea and Japan are
critical partners.

Although Trump has not yet been sworn into office, [the contours of
his]{.underline} national security and foreign policy [team suggest [his
admin]{.mark}istration [will **support
trilateralism**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Senator Marco
[[Rubio]{.underline}]{.mark} (R-FL) is expected to serve as the
secretary of state and [has [strongly supported trilateral
relations]{.mark}]{.underline}. When President Yoon and then Prime
Minister Kishida Fumio visited Camp David in August 2023, the senator
wrote on social media that a "trilateral alliance between the US, Japan,
and Korea would be a crucial foundation that furthers our joint efforts
in the Indo-Pacific." Representative Mike Waltz (R-FL), who has been
tapped as national security advisor, also seems to view the Indo-Pacific
in a manner that supports trilateralism. Waltz, like Rubio, is one of
the co-authors of an April 2024 congressional report on the need for a
national maritime strategy. The document identifies China as a
significant threat in this domain and calls for "mutually beneficial
relationships with treaty allies, exploring comparative advantages to
lower cost, time, and the complexity of rebuilding America's domestic
shipping and shipbuilding industry."

Elbridge Colby, a member of the first Trump administration who has been
tapped to be undersecretary of defense for policy, shares such concerns
about China. Colby has been outspoken in identifying the Taiwan Strait
and Korean Peninsula as potential conflict areas. He has stressed the
need for South Korea to take on the overwhelming responsibility for its
own defense (potentially including its own nuclear deterrent) and the
interconnectivity between South Korean and Japanese security and
promoted a rethinking of the US force posture on the Korean Peninsula
and the broader Indo-Pacific region to more flexibly address
simultaneous conflicts and threats from China. For his part, Pete
Hegseth, former Fox and Friends Weekend host and Trump's nominee for
secretary of defense, has said little about the Indo-Pacific. However,
his past news commentary on Fox News suggests he would be a vociferous
supporter of Trump's national security decisions, whatever they might
be. Taken together, these prospective [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}
administration [[officials suggest there will be voices supporting
trilateral cooperation in dealing with security challenges in the
Indo-Pacific]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Cooperation with Japan over icebreakers relieves the effect of tariffs and revitalizes US-Japan relations

Julian **Ryall 25**, journalist for South China Morning Post, 5/27/25,
"Japan offers US shipbuilding help to shore up naval might, ease tariff
pain",
https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3311827/japan-offers-us-shipbuilding-help-shore-naval-might-ease-tariff-pain?//:)

[[Japan]{.mark} has [offered to]{.mark} **support US efforts** to
**rebuild**]{.underline} its civilian and military **[shipbuilding
industries]{.underline}** -- a strategic gesture analysts say [could
[help **counter China's**]{.mark} growing **[dominance]{.mark}** in the
sector [and **ease** the impact of]{.mark}]{.underline} looming American
[**[tariffs]{.mark}** on Japanese imports]{.underline}.

Prime Minister Shigeru [[Ishiba announced Japan's desire to help]{.mark}
the United States]{.underline} during a speech in Kyoto on Sunday,
[emphasising **Japanese shipbuilders' skills**]{.underline} and the
[country's long seafaring history]{.underline}.

"The [[government wants to **cooperate** in]{.mark} the
**[shipbuilding]{.mark}** sector]{.underline}," Ishiba said. "[[Japan
has a]{.mark} substantial [advantage in]{.mark} terms of
[icebreakers]{.mark}. **Icebreakers** are [one **key area**]{.mark} of
cooperation]{.underline}," he added, referring to specialised ships
designed to navigate through ice-covered waters, often used for polar
research and Arctic or Antarctic operations.

Japan has high hopes that the [[technology developed for its]{.mark}
**state-of-the-art** [icebreaker]{.mark}]{.underline} Shirase [[could be
adopted by the US and]{.underline}]{.mark} potentially [[have]{.mark}
**crossover [applications]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} US **[military]{.mark}**
vessels.]{.underline}

Ishiba noted that Washington was seeking shipyards in allied countries
for repairs and refits of its warships, instead of sending them back to
the US. He suggested that Japan was prepared to assist in this effort.

Analysts say [Japan stands to benefit]{.underline} substantially [from
any such agreement]{.underline} as [[it would]{.mark} help to
**[reinvigorate]{.mark}** the **domestic [shipbuilding]{.mark}**
industry; [**bind** the US]{.mark} more closely [to the]{.mark}
**bilateral [security treaty]{.mark}**; [and]{.mark}]{.underline}
potentially [[**reduce** the impact of]{.mark} the **looming
[tariffs]{.mark}**]{.underline} that President Donald [Trump remains
committed to imposing]{.underline}, even on traditional allies.

"I would say that [[the]{.mark} biggest [aim]{.mark}]{.underline} for
the Japanese side [[is to]{.mark} try to [**defray** the cost of
the]{.mark} anticipated **[tariffs]{.mark}**]{.underline}," Stephen
Nagy, a professor of international relations at Tokyo's International
Christian University, told This Week in Asia.

No one knows the final US tariff rate on imports from Japan, but it is
expected to be at least the baseline 10 per cent, with higher rates for
sectors such as cars and electronics.

"Ishiba is effectively demonstrating that [Japan is willing to
**defray** some of the costs associated with the
**tariffs**]{.underline} and that it is willing to take on increased
burden-sharing within the alliance," Nagy said.

#### US-Japan cooperation is key to deter nuclear threats.

Mari **Yamaguchi 24**, Japanese political journalist for the Associated
Press, 7/28/24, "US-Japan security talks focus on bolstering military
cooperation, underscore threat from China"
https://apnews.com/article/japan-us-military-command-missile-china-4e97f4cb01cfef7b6db8fb1a5df771e4//WF

TOKYO (AP) --- [**[Japan]{.mark}ese** and]{.underline}
[**[U.S.]{.mark}** defense chiefs]{.underline} and top diplomats
[[agreed to]{.underline}]{.mark} further [[bolster]{.mark} their
**military [cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline} by upgrading the command
and control of U.S. forces in the East Asian country and strengthening
American-licensed missile production there, [[describing the]{.mark}
[**rising threat** from **China** as]{.mark} "the **[greatest]{.mark}**
strategic **challenge**."]{.underline}

Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin
joined their Japanese counterparts, Yoko Kamikawa and Minoru Kihara, at
the Japan-U.S. Security Consultative Committee in Tokyo, known as "2+2"
security talks where [[they **reaffirmed** their]{.mark} **bilateral
[alliance]{.mark}**]{.underline} following President Joe Biden 's
withdrawal from the November presidential race.

Japan is home to more than 50,000 U.S. troops, but the commander for the
U.S. Forces Japan headquartered in Yokota in the western suburbs of
Tokyo, tasked with managing their bases, has no commanding authority.
Instead, instructions come from the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii.
The plans will give the USFJ greater capability while still reporting to
INDOPACOM.

The command upgrade "will be the most significant change to the U.S.
Forces Japan since its creation and one of the strongest improvements in
our military ties with Japan in 70 years," Austin said. "These new
[operational [capabilities]{.mark} and responsibilities [will
**advance**]{.mark} our **[collective
deterrence]{.mark}**."]{.underline}

"We are [standing at a [historic **turning point** as]{.mark} the
rules-based, free and open [**international order** is
**shaken**]{.mark} to the core]{.underline}," Kamikawa said. "[[Now is a
**critical phase**]{.mark} when our decision today determines our
future."]{.underline}

Austin, in his opening remarks, said [[**China** is "engaging in
**coercive behavior**]{.mark}, trying to change the status quo in the
East and South China Seas, around Taiwan and throughout the region,"
adding that [**North Korea's nuclear** program and]{.mark} its deepening
[**cooperation** with **Russia** "**threaten**]{.mark} regional and
**[global security]{.mark}**."]{.underline}

In the joint statement issued after the talks, the ministers said
[[China]{.mark}'s foreign policy "[seeks to **reshape** the
**international order**]{.mark} for its own benefit at the **expense**
of others]{.underline}" and that "such behavior is [[a **serious
concern** to the alliance]{.mark} and the entire international community
and represents the greatest strategic challenge in the Indo-Pacific
region and beyond."]{.underline}

[China has been at odds with many countries]{.underline} in the
Asia-Pacific for years because of its sweeping maritime claims [over the
crucial **[South China Sea]{.mark}**. It also claims self-governing
[Taiwan]{.mark} as its territory, [to be annexed by force]{.mark} if
necessary.]{.underline} In March, [[Beijing announced a 7.2%
**increase** in its **defense budget**]{.underline}]{.mark}, already the
world's second-highest behind the United States, [[marking]{.mark} a
massive **military [expansion]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

The ministers said the US command reorganization, set for March to be in
line with Japan's own command updating, aimed "to facilitate deeper
interoperability and cooperation on joint bilateral operations in
peacetime and during contingencies" and [enhance intelligence
coordination, surveillance, reconnaissance and
cybersecurity]{.underline}.

The new U.S. command in Japan will be led by a three-star general, not
the four-star sought by Japan, but Austin said "we haven't ruled that
out" and will keep negotiating.

Japan has long suffered from cybersecurity threats that Washington
believes are of grave concern. Lately, Japan's space agency revealed it
suffered a series of cyberattacks, and though sensitive information
related to space and defense was not affected, it has triggered worry
and pushed the agency to pursue preventative measures.

The ministers in a joint statement reaffirmed the [U[.S. commitment to

[Geopolitical analysts have long talked about "frozen
conflicts"]{.underline} in Transnistria, Nagorno-Karabakh, and
elsewhere, but [they should pay more attention to a **conflict** that is
about to become **unfrozen**]{.underline}.

[[With the melting of]{.mark} Arctic [ice
caps]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [[geopolitical competition is
**heating up**]{.mark} in the High North]{.underline}. [Arctic
[countries are **eager to benefit**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[from
**unlocked natural resources** and]{.mark} **new [trade
routes]{.mark}**]{.underline}[; [Russia is]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[**ramping up** its **military presence**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the
region; [and]{.underline} even [[China is looking to **get in on the
action**]{.underline}]{.mark}, ludicrously [declaring itself a
"near-Arctic state."]{.underline}

[[A major NATO-Russia conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}, starting in Ukraine
or the Baltic States, [could **[easily escalate]{.mark}** to engulf the
High North.]{.underline} While [[Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} army has
been chewed up in Ukraine, its [[navy, air force, and nuclear forces
remain largely **untouched**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Russia's [Northern
Fleet]{.mark} is [based]{.mark} near Murmansk]{.underline}, Russia, [a
city [just 120 miles from]{.mark}]{.underline} Kirkenes, Norway ([[where
NATO begins]{.underline}]{.mark}).

[[Due to melting ice, Russian warships]{.mark} now have [greater freedom

island of Svalbard) [to evade NATO detection]{.underline}.
[[Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} Anti-Access/Area Denial ([[A2AD]{.mark})

target for the Russian navy]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[setting the stage
for a **new battle**]{.mark} of the **Atlantic**]{.underline}.

The new geography of NATO enlargement, however, also creates
vulnerabilities for Russia. With Finland and (likely in the near future)
Sweden in NATO, the alliance suddenly has strategic depth near the
important Kola Peninsula. [In the event of conflict, [NATO]{.mark}
[could attack Russian supply lines]{.mark} and cut off and isolate
Russia's Northern Fleet]{.underline}. [[This vulnerability]{.mark} could
also become important pressure point]{.underline} against Russia in

DBSTM\]

The Cold War never ended - it just moved to the Arctic and got nuclear

In late March, at the VI Arctic Forum held in Murmansk, Russian
President Vladimir Putin declared Moscow\'s commitment to expanding its
fleet of nuclear icebreakers.

\"[[Russia already possesses the **largest** icebreaker fleet
**globally**]{.underline}]{.mark},\" Putin noted. \"[We must further
solidify our position by commissioning advanced icebreakers,
particularly nuclear-powered vessels uniquely available to us.\" He
emphasized that \"[no other nation has a comparable
fleet]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}

But what exactly can Russia\'s Arctic fleet accomplish?

A new generation

This Wednesday, the fourth nuclear-powered icebreaker of Project 22220,
the \'Yakutia\', completed sea trials and departed for operations along
the Northern Sea Route (NSR).

The \'Yakutia\' ranks among the world\'s most powerful nuclear
icebreakers. The construction of Project 22220 icebreakers began in
2013, with plans to build at least seven ships. Three vessels - the
\'Arktika\', \'Siberia\', and \'Ural\' - have already entered service.
The lead ship, the \'Arktika\', was commissioned in 2020, becoming a
flagship of Russia\'s contemporary Arctic exploration efforts. It was
followed by the \'Siberia\' in 2021 and \'Ural\' in 2022. Two additional
ships, the \'Chukotka\' and \'Kamchatka\', are currently under
construction, and the keel for a seventh vessel, the \'Sakhalin\', will
be laid later this year. These icebreakers are constructed at the Baltic
Shipyard in St. Petersburg, funded by Rosatom\'s Atomflot with state
support.

[[Advanced nuclear icebreaker]{.underline}s]{.mark} such as the
\'Yakutia\' are specifically [[engineered for harsh Arctic]{.mark}
[conditions]{.mark}, and are [capable of breaking ice]{.mark} up to
three meters thick.]{.underline} Their unique hull designs enhance
maneuverability in extreme cold and dense ice environments. Equipped
with two nuclear reactors generating a combined 60 megawatts, [they [can
operate autonomously for **several months**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Today, these vessels represent the most powerful and efficient
icebreakers worldwide. Importantly, Russia has significantly reduced
reliance on imported components, with domestically produced parts
comprising 92% of each ship. Ultimately, Russia aims for complete
self-sufficiency in producing all components for future nuclear
icebreakers.

Project 22220 [icebreakers are [**versatile**, designed for **both**
open ocean and river]{.mark} channel navigation. Their design
[integrates the strengths of]{.mark} [previous]{.mark}-generation
[vessels]{.mark},]{.underline} such as the ocean-going \'Arktika\' and
the river-focused \'Taimyr\'. Adjustable ballast tanks can be filled
with seawater to increase draft and enhance icebreaking capability.

\'Yakutia\'-class [icebreakers are intended to replace older ships
nearing the end of their operational lives]{.underline}. As the newer
icebreakers enter service, older vessels such as the \'Taimyr\',
\'Vaigach\', and \'Yamal\' will eventually be decommissioned. While
their operational lifespan has been extended until 2027, these aging
icebreakers will ultimately be succeeded by more advanced and powerful
vessels.

What\'s at stake?

Currently, Russia\'s Atomflot operates nine nuclear icebreakers: the
nuclear-powered transport ship \'Sevmorput\', two river-class
icebreakers (\'Taimyr\' and \'Vaigach\'), sea-class icebreakers such as
the \'Yamal\' and the Project 10521 \"50 Years of Victory,\" alongside
the latest Project 22220 vessels.

These ships support Russia\'s rapid Arctic development and establish
navigable shipping routes from Murmansk to Kamchatka along the NSR.

Beyond nuclear icebreakers, Russia maintains conventional icebreakers
and is constructing four non-nuclear, ice-class Project 23550 patrol
vessels. This robust fleet significantly enhances Russia\'s capabilities
for year-round maritime navigation in the Arctic, securing conventional
shipping and safeguarding national interests in the region.

Why the Arctic matters

The [[Arctic region holds **vast** reserves]{.mark} of natural
resources - oil, gas, minerals, and fisheries - which could
[significantly impact the global economy]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Additionally, it offers strategic advantages for developing
transcontinental shipping routes. Russia\'s Northern Sea Route could
substantially shorten trade distances between Europe and Asia,
connecting China, Japan, Europe, and the US East Coast.
[**[Nuclear]{.mark}** [icebreakers]{.mark} are [**essential** for safely
guiding vessels through Arctic ice]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Recently, the [United States raised discussions regarding Greenland\'s
geopolitical status]{.underline}. Clearly, the [[US]{.mark}, having
[fallen behind in **Arctic exploration**]{.mark}, [seeks
solutions]{.mark} to regain influence.]{.underline} Greenland, an
autonomous territory within Denmark, holds strategic importance in the
Arctic. In a world increasingly driven by resource access and shipping
lanes, major powers such as the US aim to strengthen their presence,
particularly amid rising activity by Russia and China.

However, the [US [currently lacks a nuclear icebreaker flee]{.mark}t
comparable to Russia\'s and faces challenges even with conventional
icebreakers, which [**severely** limits its Arctic
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}. Resolving Greenland\'s status alone
won\'t overcome this strategic disadvantage. [To effectively compete in
the Arctic, **[the US would require substantial long-term investments to
build an advanced icebreaker fleet, ensuring access to]{.mark} [Arctic
routes and resources.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

### S\-\--Arctic Key

#### Russia wants the arctic because of military interests as well

Carnegie's Program and national intelligence officer; Russia in the
Arctic---A Critical Examination;

DBSTM\]

Russian Military and Economic Interests in the Arctic

[[Russia has **three key military interests in the
Arctic**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Foremost is [[securing the
**second-strike capability**]{.mark} of its ballistic missile
submarine]{.underline} (SSBN) force on the Kola Peninsula---home to
seven of the Russian Navy's eleven ballistic missile submarines---in a
conflict with NATO.8 Concerns about the security of these assets largely
account for Russia's efforts to improve its anti-access/area-denial
systems and monitoring and surveillance capabilities, the increasing
tempo of strategic exercises and patrols of long-range bombers and
anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft, and the upgrading of military
infrastructure to support these operations.9

A second, partly related, [interest is [protecting **Russia's ability to
operate**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the North Atlantic and the European
Arctic in the event of a conflict with NATO. Unlike Russia's other
fleets, the Northern Fleet has direct access to the Barents and
Norwegian Seas and the Atlantic Ocean. Its ability to operate there
could be critical in determining the outcome of a conflict on NATO's
eastern flank.10

A third interest is [military [protection for Russia's]{.mark} **growing
[economic development]{.mark}**, investments]{.underline}, and
commercial interests in the Arctic. The vastness of the region, the long
and open borders whose only protection is offered by remoteness and
inhospitable climate, the poor communications systems and
infrastructure, the overall harsh environmental conditions, and growing
civilian activities there increase the risk of maritime shipping,
nuclear, and environmental accidents---[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} thus
[[the **need to be able to rapidly deploy military-response
capabilities.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

[Russia's peacetime military presence in the Arctic and the allocation
of resources to improve its military capabilities and infrastructure
there are aligned with these interests]{.underline}. Maintaining a
predominant military position in the Arctic is seen as a necessary
component of Russia's posture there, given the Kremlin's priorities in
Europe and tense relationship with the West, NATO's enhanced military
capabilities near the Russian border, and Western sanctions targeted to
constrain Russian energy exploration and production activities in the
Arctic.

Economics and Energy

[Russia's sparsely populated [Arctic]{.mark} [territories]{.mark}
account for [**10 percent** of the country's g]{.mark}ross
[d]{.mark}omestic [p]{.mark}roduct [and]{.mark} roughly [**20 percent**
of its exports]{.mark}]{.underline}. Hydrocarbons comprise the major
share, but these also include nonferrous and precious metals, stones,
and other raw materials.11 About one-third of all fish harvested in
Russia comes from Arctic waters, making it a key food source. The
Russian government hopes to increase that share by 2030, as warming
ocean water pushes fish stocks northward.12

[[Tapping these resources is Russia's **primary**]{.mark} **economic
[interest]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but doing so will require developing
costly and complicated road, rail, aviation, and maritime transportation
infrastructure to connect the Arctic to other parts of the country and
beyond. It will also require expanding icebreaking capabilities and
developing ports, weather stations, and emergency response facilities.
[[Building]{.mark} this [infrastructure]{.mark} [is]{.mark} Moscow's
**[second]{.mark} economic priority** in the region.]{.underline}

Executive Summary:

In response to what Moscow labels the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization's militarization of the Arctic, [[Russia has
**significantly** restructured]{.mark} its [Arctic
policies]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Russia has [[expanded]{.mark} the Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation
and enacted [**symbolic legislative** and **institutional changes** to
**cement federal control and legitimize**]{.mark} **future [territorial
claims in the Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Moscow [created a]{.mark} Maritime [Collegium to preserve Russia's
status of a **great naval power**,]{.mark} [signaling]{.mark} Russia's
[intent to **reclaim**]{.mark} **its [imperial]{.mark} maritime
[stature]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

The [Kremlin's Arctic [policy **underscores defense
supremacy**]{.mark}**, [resource extraction]{.mark}, [population
incentives, and expansion of the N]{.mark}orthern [S]{.mark}ea
[R]{.mark}oute**, while downplaying ecological integrity]{.underline}.

In a recent speech at the Eurasian International Socio-Political
Hearings in Perm, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov claimed that
[[Moscow]{.mark} sees "**[overt attempts to militarize the
Arctic]{.mark}**" [by]{.mark} the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization]{.underline} ([[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}) as pretexts for
constructing new infrastructure (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia,
May 29). Irrespective of the validity of this claim, [Russia's internal
response to a changing Arctic security environment has considerably
evolved since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine]{.underline} in 2022.
[This is [reflected in **administrative and institutional
changes**]{.mark} in the Russian Arctic]{.underline}, as well as shifts
in decision-makers [**[responsible for]{.mark} [implementing]{.mark}
Russia's [Arctic policies]{.mark}, and ideas [articulated by members of
the]{.mark} Russian [defense]{.mark}** and security communities
regarding the Arctic region]{.underline}.

The two [main administrative developments in Russia's Arctic policy
since February 2022 are legislative acts and symbolic institutional
changes]{.underline}. Russia [**[introduced several legislative
acts]{.mark}** aimed at [expanding]{.mark} the
**[territorial-administrative boundaries]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the
Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation (AZRF). On March 23, 2024, a new
decree further expanded the AZRF, adding two new municipalities of the
Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug--Yugra to the AZRF (RIA Novosti, March 20,
2024). Moscow aims not only to further consolidate federal control over
local natural resources, which is a matter of critical importance for
financing the war against Ukraine and balancing the budget, but also to
solidify its position in the region. Russia also seeks to expand its
Arctic zone as part of legitimizing its claims for a special status in
the region. This is likely to serve as a justification for further
territorial claims in the Arctic shelf in the future.

This **[[move is not coincidental]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Since 1991,
[Moscow has [atte**mpted to redraw the territorial
boundaries**]{.mark}]{.underline} of the AZRF, which have usually
coincided with worsening political relations with the West. In 2008,
Russia adopted its first, since the pre-1991 period, strategic
Arctic-related document titled "Foundation of State Policy of the
Russian Federation in the Arctic Until 2020 and the Future Perspective"
(Static.government.ru, accessed June 7). In 2014, Russian President
Vladimir Putin signed a document defining the land-based boundaries of
the AZRF (Rossiiskaya Gazeta, May 2, 2014). In 2017, 2019, and 2020,
territorial boundaries of the AZRF were expanded several times, adding
remaining parts of Karelia, Arkhangelsk oblast, the Komi Republic, and
Krasnoyarsk krai to the AZRF (Ivo.garant.ru, June 27,
2017;Consultant.ru, May 13, 2019; Publication.pravo.gov.ru, July 13,
2020).

At the institutional level, [Moscow has [implemented changes that
indicate **Russia's determination to maintain its dominance in the
Arctic**]{.mark}.]{.underline} On August 13, 2024, Putin signed a decree
inaugurating the Maritime Collegium of the Russian Federation. Under the
collegium's umbrella, three additional bodies---the Council for
Strategic Development of the Navy, Council for Defense of the National
Interests of the Russian Federation in the Arctic, and Council for
Development and Securing of Maritime Activities--- were established
(President of Russia, August 13, 2024; see EDM, September 4, 2024).
According to the official decree, the collegium's main task is to
"elaborate on measures aimed at preserving the status of a great naval
power" (President of Russia, August 13, 2024).

This broad task includes several specific measures that will be
monitored and coordinated by the new body. [[Russia]{.mark} plans to
develop its naval potential, [including **fixing problems in the
shipbuilding industry**]{.mark} and the drastic renewal of domestic
naval research and development by attracting scientists and research
institutions to best implement national maritime policy and the
protection of Russian national interests.]{.underline} Russian
[[national interests in]{.mark} terms of the [exploration,
exploitation]{.mark}, and protection [of natural resources in
the]{.mark} World Ocean, as well as the [Arctic]{.mark} and Antarctic
regions plan to be developed.]{.underline} The Northern Sea Route (NSR)
will be developed as a "national transportation communication" artery to
secure Russia's guaranteed access to global transit via the World's
oceans. Russia will also focus on the mutually beneficial partnerships
and relations in naval activity, given the conditions for "forming a
polycentric world," entailing a multipolar approach to Russian
international relations in the maritime sphere (President of Russia,
August 13, 2024).

The new Maritime Collegium will be directly subordinated to the Russian
president and headed by Nikolai Patrushev, a former Secretary of the
Security Council and long-time Putin ally, who is currently in charge of
national maritime policy (Vzglyad, August 13). Putting Patrushev
essentially in charge of Russia's Arctic policies is a clear sign of the
prevalence of Cold War thinking in Russia's Arctic strategy. The
inauguration of the Maritime Collegium clearly aims to strengthen
Russian statehood (державность, derzhavnost) as a continuation of both
its imperial and Soviet legacies and traditions. The new Maritime
Collegium can be seen as a continuation of the policies of Russian
Emperor Peter the Great, who prioritized Russia's transformation into a
maritime power. Maritime development, in turn, afforded advantages to
Imperial Russia's status as a great power. This was particularly evident
in 1717 when Tsar Peter I inaugurated the Board of Admiralties
(Адмиралтейств-коллегия, Admiralteystv-kollegiya)---a supreme body for
the administration of the Imperial Russian Navy and admiralty shipyards
in the Russian Empire (Mil.Press FLOT, accessed June 17). The original
Imperial Board of Admiralties is similar to the newly created Maritime
Collegium in terms of its functions, responsibilities, and authority
delegated to it. [These [features]{.mark} may [indicate]{.mark} the
**[significance of symbolism in Russia's]{.mark} naval and [Arctic
strategies]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

Institutional transformations bring Patrushev and his circles to the
forefront of Russia's Arctic policy. This group is now likely assuming
the leading role in shaping and determining Russia's Arctic strategy.

As a state corporation (государственная корпорация, goskorporatsiya),
Russia's Rosatom essentially took control of major economic and cultural
Arctic-related projects and initiatives (Neftegaz.ru, June 28, 2022).
These have included transportation projects along the NSR, the
construction of icebreakers, and international cultural and educational
youth programs (see EDM, June 12, 2023, September 4, November 25, \[1\],
\[2\], 2024, April 18). In terms of oversight over political
developments and management in Arctic-related matters, however, certain
Rosatom officials and Russian officials perform duplicate functions. For
example, the control and supervision of political processes in and
around the Arctic were shaped by a duumvirate, with Yuri Trutnev, the
Deputy Prime Minister of Russia and Presidential Envoy to the Far
Eastern Federal District, and Dmitry Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of the
Security Council of Russia, playing key roles. Both individuals differ
from Patrushev in terms of experience, energy, determination, and their
focus on intelligence- and security-related issues (Republic, October
16, 2024).

After becoming head of the new Maritime Collegium, Patrushev outlined in
[a **[six-point plan]{.mark}** of his vision [for the
Arctic]{.mark},]{.underline} consisting of the following priorities
(TASS, December 18, 2024). The first includes defense and security
priorities. These consist of the impenetrability of the national borders
in the Arctic; ensuring Russia's military superiority; the development
of dual-purpose infrastructural objects and search-and-rescue
infrastructure; and the formation of the satellite units and means of
communication. In an earlier statement, Patrushev drew attention to
climate change and the need to strengthen Russia's national focus in the
Arctic on defense and security. He claimed that climate change
contributes to the growing geostrategic potential of the Arctic---in
terms of both exploitation of its natural resources and expanding
transportation capabilities---which in turn contributes to "political
tensions and military competition in the Arctic ... and growing
activities on the part of NATO members ... contributing to the growth of
conflict potential in the region" (RIA Novosti, December 18, 2024).

In early 2025, Patrushev referred to the [[Arctic as a territory]{.mark}
"[playing the key role]{.mark} in the realization [of]{.mark}
\[Russia's\] **[national interests and upholding national
security]{.mark}**]{.underline}" (National Defense, February 15). He
also noted, among other things, that Russia's longest
border---consisting 20,000 kilometers (approximately 12,400 miles) in
the Arctic---"[[needs protection]{.mark} against our Arctic neighbors
and their increasingly provocative behavior"]{.underline} (National
Defense, February 15).

The second priority includes [[increasing the number of Arctic
residents]{.mark} by allocating additional funds and creating special
conditions to attract and retain settlers in the Arctic]{.underline}
(see EDM, November 15, 2022, March 4). This aspect has a pronounced
defense- and military-related subtone.

The third priority includes the [**development of clusters**
specializing in the **[extraction of minerals]{.mark}** and raw
materials, as well as commodities]{.underline}. Patrushev specifically
highlighted the importance of continuing and expanding geological
research on the Arctic shelf---likely to boost Russia's territorial
claims in the Arctic---and investment in Arctic transportation (TASS,
December 18, 2024).

The forth priority [includes **[upgrading the transportational
potential]{.mark} of** the NSR by enabling cargo delivery]{.underline}
to the remote areas of Russia's Arctic region, and employing the NSR as
the key artery of international trade, bringing Russia's products,
mainly raw materials and hydrocarbons, for export (TASS, December 18,
2024).

The fifth priority includes [[expediting]{.mark} the [development
of]{.mark} Arctic-related scientific [projects]{.mark} with [**special
emphasi**s on]{.mark} such areas as Arctic shipbuilding, likely,
**[icebreakers]{.mark}**]{.underline} and liquefied natural gas (LNG)
carriers; materials science; the nuclear industry and technology;
nature-like technologies (природоподобные технологии, prirodnopodobnyje
tekhnologii), which draw on solutions resembling natural systems and
structures (TASS, December 18, 2024).

The sixth priority includes [[resolving ecology-related issues]{.mark}
and concerns]{.underline}. Patrushev specifically highlighted that the
importance of these issues primarily stems from "ecological agendas
being used \[by Western countries\] against \[Russia\] as an instrument
of pressure" (TASS, December 18, 2024). Given Patrushev's concern over
the use of ecological issues on the informational battlefield and the
fact that after February 2022, [Russia chose to either evict of shut
down Russia-based ecology-related organizations, [Moscow's approach will
be **less focused** on finding]{.mark} genuine [solutions to]{.mark}
environmental [issues, but rather]{.mark} on [concealing]{.mark}
Russia's [continuous]{.mark} [**exploitation** of the]{.mark} Arctic
[environment]{.mark} and ecosystem]{.underline} (see EDM, June 17).

[[Competition for control of the Arctic is **heating up**]{.mark}.
Russia and China recently carried out a joint patrol of the
region]{.underline} - a first, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. And
the [[U.S.]{.mark} might **[increasingly]{.mark}** be [at a
disadvantage]{.mark} [because of a shortage of ships]{.mark} needed to
navigate the Arctic, icebreakers]{.underline}. Peter Rybski is a retired
U.S. naval commander now living in Finland. He writes a substack called
\"Sixty Degrees North,\" focusing on national security and maritime
issues. Welcome to the program.

PETER RYBSKI: Thanks. It\'s great to be here, Ayesha.

RASCOE: Why are countries competing for influence in the Arctic and why
are icebreakers so key to that effort?

RYBSKI: Well, Ayesha, so over the past two decades or so, [[with the
receding of]{.mark} the sea [ice]{.mark},]{.underline} particularly in
the summer, [you\'ve had an **[increase in maritime traffic]{.mark}**
because the waters are open and they\'re open for longer.]{.underline}
And with that, you have areas of the Arctic that are more open for oil,
gas and mineral exploration and fishing, whereas, maybe 20 years ago,
you didn\'t have so much maritime traffic off the coast of Alaska going
through the Bering Strait and around the U.S. These days, [traffic is
markedly increased, and Russia\'s working hard exploring and bringing
natural gas to market through the Northern Sea route and through the
Arctic to the Far East.]{.underline}

RASCOE: Why are icebreakers, then, important? Is it because, even though
the ice is receding, the waters are still pretty kind of treacherous or
difficult to traverse?

RYBSKI: Yes, that\'s exactly it. [Just because there\'s more open ice
doesn\'t mean you don\'t have to break the ice through some of the areas
or, you know, keep the ice out of the way.]{.underline} Sort of
paradoxically, I mean, [the more open ice you have, the more ships you
have]{.underline}. And then to keep those vessels safe and to get them
through some of the stickier parts, [[you **need** more
icebreakers]{.underline}]{.mark} or ice-capable vessels to do it.

RASCOE: Well, let me ask you about that because the subject of
icebreakers came up at a recent congressional hearing, and I gather that
the U.S. Coast Guard has just two in operation. Why does the U.S. Coast
Guard only have two, and how does that compare with Russia and China?

RYBSKI: That\'s right. At the moment, the U.S. Coast Guard has two
polar-capable icebreakers. And really, for quite a long time, up until
this traffic really took off, most of what the U.S. Coast Guard was
doing with their icebreakers was supporting scientific research
missions. And for that, two vessels was largely sufficient. But they
realized that [[in order to patrol]{.mark} all this area and to ensure
that the Navy - should it need to - have access to the Arctic or the
Antarctic waters when they\'re ice-covered, [they would need to have
**eight or nine vessels**]{.mark}.]{.underline} So [[they started a
program]{.mark} to do so, [but it\'s not going so
well]{.mark}]{.underline}. People often like to compare the numbers
because it\'s quite stark. I mean, [[Russia has]{.underline}]{.mark} -
depending on who you talk to and how you - where you draw the line on
what is an icebreaker - you know, [**[40 to 55]{.mark}** ice-capable
vessels]{.underline} that are operating. But realistically, they have a
need to. I mean, they use a northern sea route to move goods between
their own ports. So I don\'t think the numbers themselves tell the whole
story. Rather, it\'s can we do what we need to do and ensure that the
Navy has access should it need it?

RASCOE: So this summer, the U.S. did sign an agreement with Canada and
Finland to increase collaboration on building icebreakers. How
significant might that be, especially in terms of increasing the fleet
of icebreakers?

RYBSKI: I think it could be significant, but at this stage, it\'s too
early to tell. I know that the Finns think that they have the expertise
and the ability to help us acquire vessels. But right now, the
indications that I\'ve seen is that the U.S. Coast Guard wants to build
all of its icebreakers in the United States.

RASCOE: I guess, why is the U.S. industry struggling to do this?

RYBSKI: I think there are two reasons. First is that [[we haven\'t built
an icebreaker]{.mark} in the U.S. - a heavy icebreaker - [since the
**1970s**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And they require a lot of special metals
because the hull has to be pretty strong, which requires some welding
techniques that our shipyards are struggling with trying to learn. And
basically, we just haven\'t done it in a while.

The second part is that the technology has changed. In the 1970s,
icebreakers - like, their ability to break ice was determined by two
things. There\'s the shape of their hull and how powerful their engines
were. But now [modern icebreakers using something called azimuth
propulsion]{.underline} - they\'re just little pods that spin around.
[They can break ice in a different manner that requires less engine
power]{.underline}. And so we\'re trying to build a modern icebreaker as
well, something that hasn\'t been done in the United States.

RASCOE: What might be the consequences [if the U.S. doesn\'t increase
its presence in the Arctic]{.underline}?

RYBSKI: Well, at the rate we\'re headed, [[one of our
icebreakers]{.mark} is, I mentioned, is **[over 50 years old]{.mark}**,
and it spends half of its time in drydock being repaired so it can
support the mission]{.underline}. So [[if we have a casualty or a
mechanical problem,]{.mark} **[we\'ll have no presence in the
Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which, [[from a national security
standpoint]{.mark}, means that [we can\'t be present]{.mark} to keep an
eye on what Russia or China may be doing up there]{.underline}. And [if
we can\'t see it and we can\'t patrol it, [then **we can\'t control our
own waters**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

RASCOE: That\'s Peter Rybski, a retired U.S. naval commander. Thank you
so much for joining us.

RYBSKI: Thank you. Thank you very much.

[Plans for **large-scale expansion** of]{.underline} Northern Sea Route
trade means that the number of [icebreakers]{.underline} required will
[increase from 10 or 11 to between 15 and 17]{.underline}, according [to
Rosatom Director General Alexei Likhachev.]{.underline} Speaking at the
6th International Arctic Forum, Likhachev said: \"[The **volume of
cargo** has already amounted to **tens of millions of
tonnes**]{.underline} with last year\'s record of nearly 38 million
tonnes. Our northern deposits developers tell us to be prepared for
hundreds of millions of tonnes \... [now we need 11
icebreakers,]{.underline} which we already have (including eight nuclear
icebreakers). [We must **move on** to the next stage and
**plan**]{.underline} 100 and 150 million tonnes and [15 to 17
icebreakers]{.underline} instead of 10 or 11. Therefore, we must
construct them.\" He added: \"An icebreaker does not transport cargo, so
we need a cargo fleet. I understand that we do not have enough capacity
to meet the demand for cargo vessels in advance, and this is where
international cooperation is necessary. We have a very good
understanding of business on the international market. Now we are having
discussions with several countries that are experts in shipbuilding.\"
[The conference also heard **about growing cooperation** between
**Russia** and both **China** and **India** on the **Northern Sea
Route**,]{.underline} as well as discussion about [the possible
development of tourism and hospitality in the Arctic]{.underline},
especially [in the developing \'nuclear cities\']{.underline} as part of
measures to attract young professionals to live and work there. There
are currently a series of Project 22220 nuclear-powered icebreakers
operating - the Arktika, Sibir and Ural - or under construction - the
Yakutia, Chukotka and Leningrad. Last week, over several days a floating
crane was used to load the generator, condenser, turbine and other
components onto the Chukotka. Later this year the Stalingrad will be
laid down. The Project 22220 [vessels]{.underline} are 173 metres long,
34 metres wide and with a height from the waterline to the mainmast of
57 metres. They are [designed to break through ice up to three metres
thick and have a speed of 22 knots in clear water.]{.underline} The
RITM-200 is a pressurised water reactor with a thermal capacity of 175
MW, which converts to 30 MW at the propellers. It is 7.3 metres high
with a diameter of 3.3 metres and an integral layout which its
manufacturers say means it is lighter, more compact and 25 MW more
powerful than previous generations used on nuclear-powered icebreakers.
The service life is 40 years. [There is also a larger nuclear-powered
icebreaker under construction,]{.underline} the Rossiya, which will be
the first of the proposed Project 10510 nuclear-powered icebreakers. It
will feature two RITM-400 reactors for a propeller power of 120 MW[. It
will be able to penetrate ice up to 4.3 metres thick and clear a channel
up to 50 metres wide. Its most recent reported construction target
service date is 2030.]{.underline} Ice conditions \'not improving\'
Russian President Vladimir Putin also visited the International Arctic
Forum, where he heard from Director General of FSUE GlavSevmorput Sergey
Zybko that at the time there were 50 vessels in the Northern Sea Route
and nine nuclear and non-nuclear icebreakers working. Zybko said that AI
was being used to analyse satellite radar images and he said that
[global warming was not yet making the ice conditions better for the
trade route, which runs the length of Russia\'s northern coast from
Europe to Asia.]{.underline} He said: \"It should be noted that the [ice
conditions have been deteriorating over the past few years.]{.underline}
And although we often hear about global warming, current research by the
Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute does not confirm this. According
to their observations, [no significant changes in ice cover are expected
in the winter-spring period until 2050]{.underline}.\"

//reyrey

The [Great Game]{.underline} in Arctic: [India to **build** non-nuclear
**icebreaker ships for Russia** Russia has shortlisted
India]{.underline}n shipyards [to build four non-nuclear icebreaker
ships]{.underline}. This [strategic partnership will support Russia's
Northern Sea Route pla]{.underline}n, aiming to establish a new shipping
corridor through the Arctic, reducing travel time. The project will
[**significantly boost** India's **shipbuilding
capabilities**]{.underline} and [**enhance maritime ties** between India
and Russia, strengthening **bilateral relations**. I]{.underline}t will
also [increase **trade and economic cooperation**,]{.underline} with
potential for joint ventures, and strengthen India's position in the
global shipbuilding market. The [icebreakers will be designed to
navigate harsh Arctic conditions,]{.underline} facilitating year-round
navigation through the Northern Sea Route. Icebreaker Ships An
icebreaker is a special-purpose ship or boat designed to move and
navigate through ice-covered waters and provide safe waterways for other
boats and ships. The icebreaker ships have three traits: a strengthened
hull, an ice-clearing shape, and the power to push through sea ice. The
bending strength of sea ice is low enough, but even in cases of very
thick ice, an icebreaker can drive its bow onto the ice to break it
under the weight of the ship. A buildup of broken ice in front of a ship
can slow it down much more than the breaking of the ice itself, so
icebreakers have a specially designed hull to direct the broken ice
around or under the vessel. The external components of the ship's
propulsion system (propellers, propeller shafts, etc.) are at greater
risk of damage than the vessel's hull, so the ability of an icebreaker
to propel itself onto the ice, break it, and clear the debris from its
path successfully is essential for its safety. The first icebreakers in
1837 were steam-powered. The first diesel-electric icebreakers were
built in the 1930s. [Russia currently operates all existing and
functioning nuclear-powered icebreakers]{.underline}. The first one, NS
Lenin, was launched in 1957 and entered operation in 1959, before being
officially decommissioned in 1989. It was both the world's first
nuclear-powered surface ship and the first nuclear-powered civilian
vessel. In May 2007, sea trials were completed for the nuclear-powered
Russian icebreaker NS 50 Let Pobedy. The vessel was put into service by
Murmansk Shipping Company, which manages all eight Russian state-owned
nuclear icebreakers. The Arctic Region The [Arctic region covers over
**one-sixth of the earth's landmass** and is set to play an increasing
role in shaping the course of world affairs.]{.underline} The still less
explored region is [rich in exploitable **natural resources**,
especially gas and oil and marine living resources. It]{.underline} is
estimated that the Arctic could be home to nearly 20 percent of the
world's oil and natural gas. The Arctic Ocean around Earth's North Pole
is full of floating ice, with ridges up to 20 meters thick.

#### Nuclear ice breaker action is needed now---Russia is ahead but we still have a window of opportunity.

DBSTM\]

The Cold War never ended - it just moved to the Arctic and got nuclear

In late March, at the VI Arctic Forum held in Murmansk, Russian
President Vladimir Putin declared Moscow\'s commitment to expanding its
fleet of nuclear icebreakers.

\"[[Russia already possesses the **largest** icebreaker fleet
**globally**]{.underline}]{.mark},\" Putin noted. \"[We must further
solidify our position by commissioning advanced icebreakers,
particularly nuclear-powered vessels uniquely available to us.\" He
emphasized that \"[no other nation has a comparable
fleet]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}

But what exactly can Russia\'s Arctic fleet accomplish?

A new generation

This Wednesday, the fourth nuclear-powered icebreaker of Project 22220,
the \'Yakutia\', completed sea trials and departed for operations along
the Northern Sea Route (NSR).

The \'Yakutia\' ranks among the world\'s most powerful nuclear
icebreakers. The construction of Project 22220 icebreakers began in
2013, with plans to build at least seven ships. Three vessels - the
\'Arktika\', \'Siberia\', and \'Ural\' - have already entered service.
The lead ship, the \'Arktika\', was commissioned in 2020, becoming a
flagship of Russia\'s contemporary Arctic exploration efforts. It was
followed by the \'Siberia\' in 2021 and \'Ural\' in 2022. Two additional
ships, the \'Chukotka\' and \'Kamchatka\', are currently under
construction, and the keel for a seventh vessel, the \'Sakhalin\', will
be laid later this year. These icebreakers are constructed at the Baltic
Shipyard in St. Petersburg, funded by Rosatom\'s Atomflot with state
support.

[[Advanced nuclear icebreaker]{.underline}s]{.mark} such as the
\'Yakutia\' are specifically [[engineered for harsh Arctic]{.mark}
[conditions]{.mark}, and are [capable of breaking ice]{.mark} up to
three meters thick.]{.underline} Their unique hull designs enhance
maneuverability in extreme cold and dense ice environments. Equipped
with two nuclear reactors generating a combined 60 megawatts, [they [can
operate autonomously for **several months**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Today, these vessels represent the most powerful and efficient
icebreakers worldwide. Importantly, Russia has significantly reduced
reliance on imported components, with domestically produced parts
comprising 92% of each ship. Ultimately, Russia aims for complete
self-sufficiency in producing all components for future nuclear
icebreakers.

Project 22220 [icebreakers are [**versatile**, designed for **both**
open ocean and river]{.mark} channel navigation. Their design
[integrates the strengths of]{.mark} [previous]{.mark}-generation
[vessels]{.mark},]{.underline} such as the ocean-going \'Arktika\' and
the river-focused \'Taimyr\'. Adjustable ballast tanks can be filled
with seawater to increase draft and enhance icebreaking capability.

\'Yakutia\'-class [icebreakers are intended to replace older ships
nearing the end of their operational lives]{.underline}. As the newer
icebreakers enter service, older vessels such as the \'Taimyr\',
\'Vaigach\', and \'Yamal\' will eventually be decommissioned. While
their operational lifespan has been extended until 2027, these aging
icebreakers will ultimately be succeeded by more advanced and powerful
vessels.

What\'s at stake?

Currently, Russia\'s Atomflot operates nine nuclear icebreakers: the
nuclear-powered transport ship \'Sevmorput\', two river-class
icebreakers (\'Taimyr\' and \'Vaigach\'), sea-class icebreakers such as
the \'Yamal\' and the Project 10521 \"50 Years of Victory,\" alongside
the latest Project 22220 vessels.

These ships support Russia\'s rapid Arctic development and establish
navigable shipping routes from Murmansk to Kamchatka along the NSR.

Beyond nuclear icebreakers, Russia maintains conventional icebreakers
and is constructing four non-nuclear, ice-class Project 23550 patrol
vessels. This robust fleet significantly enhances Russia\'s capabilities
for year-round maritime navigation in the Arctic, securing conventional
shipping and safeguarding national interests in the region.

Why the Arctic matters

The [[Arctic region holds **vast** reserves]{.mark} of natural
resources - oil, gas, minerals, and fisheries - which could
[significantly impact the global economy]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Additionally, it offers strategic advantages for developing
transcontinental shipping routes. Russia\'s Northern Sea Route could
substantially shorten trade distances between Europe and Asia,
connecting China, Japan, Europe, and the US East Coast.
[**[Nuclear]{.mark}** [icebreakers]{.mark} are [**essential** for safely
guiding vessels through Arctic ice]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Recently, the [United States raised discussions regarding Greenland\'s
geopolitical status]{.underline}. Clearly, the [[US]{.mark}, having
[fallen behind in **Arctic exploration**]{.mark}, [seeks
solutions]{.mark} to regain influence.]{.underline} Greenland, an
autonomous territory within Denmark, holds strategic importance in the
Arctic. In a world increasingly driven by resource access and shipping
lanes, major powers such as the US aim to strengthen their presence,
particularly amid rising activity by Russia and China.

However, the [US [currently lacks a nuclear icebreaker flee]{.mark}t
comparable to Russia\'s and faces challenges even with conventional
icebreakers, which [**severely** limits its Arctic
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}. Resolving Greenland\'s status alone
won\'t overcome this strategic disadvantage. [To effectively compete in
the Arctic, **[the US would require substantial long-term investments to
build an advanced icebreaker fleet, ensuring access to]{.mark} [Arctic
routes and resources.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[[Competition for control of the Arctic is **heating up**]{.mark}.
Russia and China recently carried out a joint patrol of the
region]{.underline} - a first, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. And
the [[U.S.]{.mark} might **[increasingly]{.mark}** be [at a
disadvantage]{.mark} [because of a shortage of ships]{.mark} needed to
navigate the Arctic, icebreakers]{.underline}. Peter Rybski is a retired
U.S. naval commander now living in Finland. He writes a substack called
\"Sixty Degrees North,\" focusing on national security and maritime
issues. Welcome to the program.

PETER RYBSKI: Thanks. It\'s great to be here, Ayesha.

RASCOE: Why are countries competing for influence in the Arctic and why
are icebreakers so key to that effort?

RYBSKI: Well, Ayesha, so over the past two decades or so, [[with the
receding of]{.mark} the sea [ice]{.mark},]{.underline} particularly in
the summer, [you\'ve had an **[increase in maritime traffic]{.mark}**
because the waters are open and they\'re open for longer.]{.underline}
And with that, you have areas of the Arctic that are more open for oil,
gas and mineral exploration and fishing, whereas, maybe 20 years ago,
you didn\'t have so much maritime traffic off the coast of Alaska going
through the Bering Strait and around the U.S. These days, [traffic is
markedly increased, and Russia\'s working hard exploring and bringing
natural gas to market through the Northern Sea route and through the
Arctic to the Far East.]{.underline}

RASCOE: Why are icebreakers, then, important? Is it because, even though
the ice is receding, the waters are still pretty kind of treacherous or
difficult to traverse?

RYBSKI: Yes, that\'s exactly it. [Just because there\'s more open ice
doesn\'t mean you don\'t have to break the ice through some of the areas
or, you know, keep the ice out of the way.]{.underline} Sort of
paradoxically, I mean, [the more open ice you have, the more ships you
have]{.underline}. And then to keep those vessels safe and to get them
through some of the stickier parts, [[you **need** more
icebreakers]{.underline}]{.mark} or ice-capable vessels to do it.

RASCOE: Well, let me ask you about that because the subject of
icebreakers came up at a recent congressional hearing, and I gather that
the U.S. Coast Guard has just two in operation. Why does the U.S. Coast
Guard only have two, and how does that compare with Russia and China?

RYBSKI: That\'s right. At the moment, the U.S. Coast Guard has two
polar-capable icebreakers. And really, for quite a long time, up until
this traffic really took off, most of what the U.S. Coast Guard was
doing with their icebreakers was supporting scientific research
missions. And for that, two vessels was largely sufficient. But they
realized that [[in order to patrol]{.mark} all this area and to ensure
that the Navy - should it need to - have access to the Arctic or the
Antarctic waters when they\'re ice-covered, [they would need to have
**eight or nine vessels**]{.mark}.]{.underline} So [[they started a
program]{.mark} to do so, [but it\'s not going so
well]{.mark}]{.underline}. People often like to compare the numbers
because it\'s quite stark. I mean, [[Russia has]{.underline}]{.mark} -
depending on who you talk to and how you - where you draw the line on
what is an icebreaker - you know, [**[40 to 55]{.mark}** ice-capable
vessels]{.underline} that are operating. But realistically, they have a
need to. I mean, they use a northern sea route to move goods between
their own ports. So I don\'t think the numbers themselves tell the whole
story. Rather, it\'s can we do what we need to do and ensure that the

Despite planning large cuts to defense spending over the next four
years, [President **Trump has suggested** advancing ambitious new
projects]{.underline}---[including, supposedly]{.underline}, [a **huge
new fleet of icebreakers** in the Arctic]{.underline}. "Forty Coast
Guard big icebreakers. [**Big ones**," Trump said]{.underline} at a
press briefing in North Carolina.

The specific [40-icebreaker figure may be motivated by long-standing
fears of an **icebreaker gap** with Russia,]{.underline} which operates
around 40 of the ships, including seven heavy Polar icebreakers. By
contrast, the [U.S. Coast Guard operates only one]{.underline}
49-year-old heavy [Polar icebreaker]{.underline}, the 13,000-ton Polar
Star. It's complemented by the medium-capability icebreakers Healy and
Storis, with the latter due to begin operations out of Juneau, Alaska,
next year.

[Without assistance from icebreakers]{.underline}, ordinary [ships can
only access Arctic areas during]{.underline} a couple
[summer]{.underline} months each year. In event of future conflicts with
Russia, [this lack of icebreakers could **constrain** the Pentagon's
**ability to send troops** and **heavy equipment** to shore up ground
forces in Alaska,]{.underline} currently home to the Army's 11th
Airborne Division, which relies on helicopters and cold-weather
all-terrain vehicles for mobility.

While [defending **Alaska** is intrinsically **important**]{.underline}
(particularly as it's the base of the U.S.'s missile defenses against
strategic nuclear missiles), [there are broader
motivations]{.underline}. Due to global warming, [melting Arctic ice is
opening]{.underline} new areas around the North Pole for [potential
exploitation of minerals and oil]{.underline} or for more efficient
transit of cargoes across the globe---if ships can access them with
assistance from icebreakers.

[Trump's icebreaker fascination may also reflect]{.underline} his
interest in expanding U.S. territory in places like Canada and Greenland
through force and economic pressure. Thus, beside the World War III
scenario, there's fear [**Russia** could seize **de facto control** of
Arctic resources before the U.S.]{.underline}

Still, [the U.S. is currently **struggling to complete construction** of
the first of three planned large, new heavy icebreakers]{.underline}, so
Trump's suggestion the U.S. would acquire 40 icebreakers is unrealistic
on its face. [That's not to say there aren't ways the U.S. could acquire
more icebreakers---and quick.]{.underline} They just might not be
politically popular methods.

Icebreakers are built with specially shaped reinforced hulls and
high-power engines needed to smash through pack ice and push it aside,
creating corridors through which other ships can transit. Depending on
size and propulsion output, they can cruise continuously through ice a
few feet thick at jogging speed or ram through thicker ice
concentrations, even surging on top of ice and crushing it with the
ship's bulk.

Due to the fuel and power demands of this work, Russia's icebreaker
fleet includes eight (and counting) nuclear-powered icebreakers. No
other country operates nuclear icebreakers, though China says it will
build one eventually.

Beside polar icebreakers, the Coast Guard also operates nine 662-ton
Bay-class icebreaking tugboats and the larger multi-purpose ship
Mackinaw for operations in the Great Lakes and North Atlantic. [A lack
of U.S. icebreaking capacity in the Great Lakes reportedly has caused
the loss of **thousands of jobs** and **billions of dollars** in
**economic damage** over the last decade.]{.underline}

The Coast Guard's icebreaker deficit has been ongoing [since
the]{.underline} early 2010s. After the breakdown and [retirement of
Polar Star's sister ship, Polar Sea,]{.underline} the Coast Guard
concluded it required 4--5 heavy Polar icebreakers and 4--5 medium
Arctic icebreakers. In 2019, it awarded a contract to a Mississippi
shipyard to build the first of three planned 22,900-ton heavy Polar
Security Cutters.

Unfortunately, [new icebreaker construction coincides with another
long-running crisis: a massive **deficit** in United States
**ship-building capacity**]{.underline}. The Polar Security Cutters have
proven no exception: the program has run 60 percent over budget at \$5.1
billion, and lead ship Polar Sentinel will be delivered years behind
schedule, likely in 2030 or later. As their predecessors were built
nearly a half-century ago, icebreakers have become a lost art;
construction expertise has simply been lost.

preparation]{.underline}. Arctic alarmists remind us that Russia
operates nuclear- powered submarines in the Arctic, has dozens of
military facilities in its Arctic territory, maintains a dedicated
Arctic military command, and ﬂies bomber sorties throughout the Arctic
regularly. [[**Russia** is already **years ahead** of the United
States]{.mark} in the Arctic.]{.underline} To alarmists, Russian
military eﬀorts are [a precursor to controlling the high north,
[challenging American command of the commons, **asserting
inﬂuence**]{.mark}, and even holding the US homeland at
risk]{.underline}. Already, [Russian military capabilities threaten the
American homeland due to their unstoppable hypersonic ballistic missiles
based in the Arctic.]{.underline} In the words of former US Northern
Command Commander General Terrance O'Shaughnessy: "The Homeland is not a
sanctuary" the way it once was. Scholars will continue to debate whether
the Arctic matters for the United States such that it should compel
military involvement. There will continue to be disputes over Chinese
and Russian Arctic ambition relative to American interests. These
discussions will grapple with whether Russia aggressively seeks oﬀensive
expansion or merely defensive security for its northern territories.
Others will contend with whether China---as a self- proclaimed "near-
Arctic state"---actually desires Arctic inﬂuence via its Polar Silk Road
(part of China's major economic Belt and Road \[BRI\] initiative) or
merely seeks to advance its own economic position via access to Arctic
resources and alternative shipping lanes connecting Asia and Europe.34
We will continue reading about Russian icebreakers outnumbering American
icebreaker capabilities 20-to-1, or even 40-to-1---the so- called
icebreaker gap---and what the United States should (or should not) do
about such a capability imbalance.35 [Moreover, [Arctic alarmists will
point to the continued Russian military buildup of Arctic
infrastructure, the questionably legal control Russia claims over the
Northern Sea Route]{.mark}, and the 2014 establishment of the Northern
Fleet and its Arctic focus]{.underline}---coupled with Moscow's planning
and execution of thousands of Arctic exercises and infrastructure
modernization efforts---as points of attention for the evolving Arctic
signiﬁcance. 36For this side, Moscow's economic and military commitment
to the Arctic indicates signiﬁcant interest and intent such that the
United States must not dismiss it as irrelevant to future international
security, especially considering the United States is an Arctic state
with a national coastline on Arctic shores. We must reject the false
notion of Arctic exceptionalism regarding the great- power competition
of the twenty- ﬁrst century. Instead, we need to adopt the notion of
Arctic essentialism that sees the Arctic for its value in the
international security chess game, not for the utopic zone of peace we
hope it will be. Focusing the Arctic Debate on Harsh Realities of
Military Power. The Arctic is the only coastal region of the United
States with an active strategic competitor conducting regular military
activity oﬀ the coast, and yet northern air defenses are obsolete[. The

A Russian nuclear-powered icebreaker in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 2022.

[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, meanwhile, [[has]{.mark} around [40
icebreakers]{.mark}]{.underline}, as well as new giant nuclear-powered
ones under construction. Despite being 900 miles from the Arctic Circle,
China has four such vessels. Its first domestically built
nuclear-powered icebreaker could be unveiled as soon as this year,
experts say.

[[Russia has faced setbacks in recent years]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[Sanctions over the Ukraine war]{.mark} have **[limited]{.mark}** its
[access to components and technologies]{.mark} needed to build
icebreakers, such as propulsion systems and radar
equipment.]{.underline} A nuclear-powered icebreaker under construction
called Rossiya is running three years behind schedule. [[But it already
has a **massive** lead]{.mark}]{.underline} and years of experience
operating in the Arctic.

As in other areas, [Russia is tapping China's investment and
technological support, potentially fueling Beijing's increased interest
in the polar regions]{.underline}. It took a Chinese shipyard two years
to deliver one recent icebreaker. Though the U.S.'s new icebreaker will
be a heavier ice-breaking class than the Chinese vessel, construction
started only recently, five years after the contract was awarded to
build it.

Cutting through thick Arctic ice

[[Icebreakers are]{.underline}]{.mark} seen as
[**[indispensable]{.mark}** for maintaining a presence in the
Arctic.]{.underline} Even as global temperatures warm and open up
shipping lanes, the region remains largely impenetrable for ships in all
but one or two summer months---unless accompanied by a Polar class
icebreaker.

At 13,000 tons, the U.S. Coast Guard's Polar Star is a mammoth vessel
made to cut through Arctic ice more than 20 feet thick. But it is the
[[U.S.'s only icebreaker]{.underline}]{.mark} that operates year-round,
and it was [[built]{.mark} nearly [**half a century
ago**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In the intensifying global race to access the Arctic, [[icebreakers are
the **essential**]{.underline}]{.mark} tool to open trade routes, allow
resource extraction and project military power. The [[U.S.]{.mark} and
its allies have [fallen **far behind** Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
[[China is **rapidly gaining** ground]{.underline}]{.mark} with the help
of the world's largest shipbuilding industry.

[President [Trump]{.mark} has signaled that he wants to put the Arctic
back at the top of the U.S.'s priority list. He [has said the U.S. needs
to take ownership of Greenland]{.mark} for national
security [and]{.mark} that the Coast Guard [will **expand** its fleet of
icebreakers]{.mark}.]{.underline}

["We're going to [order about 40]{.mark} Coast Guard big
[icebreakers]{.mark}]{.underline}. Big ones," Trump said last month.

[[That will be a **tall** order to fill]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [[U.S.
has been **struggling for years** to build a single
icebreaker]{.mark}---vessels that clear a path through the ice for other

[[When it comes to lying]{.mark} in politics, [Donald Trump is in a
class of his own]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to the Washington Post,
he made [[30,573 false]{.mark} or misleading [claims in his four years

day in his first year to [[39 per day]{.mark} in his
fourth.]{.underline}

Although other presidents have lied to the public, [[none have lied like
this]{.underline}]{.mark}. Some of Trump's lies are trivial, and many
are self-aggrandising ("Nobody builds better walls than me"). Then there
are his more egregious lies, like the one about the 2020 presidential
election being "stolen" -- demonstrably and dangerously contrary to the
facts, with [[serious consequences for the nation and public
trust]{.underline}]{.mark}.

And these lies can cut through. Research by political scientists Kevin
Arceneaux and Roy Truex found that this "big lie" about the stolen
election was very "sticky". Around 50% of Republican voters believed it,
regardless of any emerging contrary evidence. The researchers also found
that belief in this lie boosted Republican supporters' self-esteem -- as
they weren't "losers" after all.

[Politicians who lie can gain a strategic advantage]{.underline}. [If

dull and uninspiring; [[the lie can be whatever you want it to

MILAN --- [President Donald [Trump's ambition to build 40]{.mark} new
[icebreakers in the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is
**unrealistic**]{.mark} [**given the current state** of the national
shipbuilding industry]{.mark},]{.underline} which may require Washington
to ask for Canada's help, according to a major Canadian shipbuilder
specializing in the construction of such vessels.

[In a Jan. 24 press briefing, Trump announced a target of acquiring
roughly 40 icebreakers]{.underline} for the U.S. Coast Guard.

"We're going to order about 40 Coast Guard big icebreakers -- big ones
-- and all of a sudden, Canada wants a piece of the deal. ... I say,
'Why are we doing that,'" he told reporters.

[On March 4, the U.S. government reinstated an executive
order]{.underline} that hit its northern neighbor [with 25%
across-the-board tariffs]{.underline} and 10% on Canadian energy[,
triggering a continental trade war.]{.underline} Ottawa has responded
with its retaliatory tariffs at the same rate but placed on a smaller
basket of American goods.

According to Canadian shipbuilder Seaspan, in charge of building two new
heavy polar icebreakers for the country's Coast Guard, the Canadian
naval industry already possesses the requisite know-how for Trump's
plan.

[["40 icebreakers]{.mark} are fantastic, but that [is]{.mark} **pretty
[aggressive]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- I don't want to go against what
Mr. Trump said, but I would say that [the [U.S. shipbuilding]{.mark}
industry [capability is]{.mark} pretty [**stressed and busy** right
now]{.mark}. ...]{.underline} I think it's fair to say that [[it is
**not \[currently\] capable**]{.mark} of doing that]{.underline}," David
Hargreaves, senior vice president of business development at Seaspan,
told Defense News.

"He also said that Canada is trying to get a part of it -- what we are
trying to do is be a contributor to our neighbors and help them," he
added.

The economic rift between the two nations does not appear to have
negatively impacted the shipbuilding industry so far. On the contrary,
companies from both sides of the border continue to engage in dialogue
and appear determined to carry out business as usual.

Davie, a Quebec shipbuilder, told Defense News earlier this year that it
was moving forward with plans to acquire an American shipyard despite
the threat of a looming trade war.

Canadian and Finnish government representatives shared similar
perspectives in Feb. 4 email statements, stating that [the tense
climate]{.underline} seen as of late [between Canada and the U.S. had
not compromised cooperation [within]{.mark} the trilateral
[I]{.mark}cebreaker [C]{.mark}ollaboration [E]{.mark}ffort.]{.underline}

While that agreement, signed last summer and known as the ICE Pact,
seeks to bring together Finnish, Canadian and U.S. expertise to build
best-in-class ice boats and cooperate in other areas, Hargreaves notes
that [[Washington has **the most to gain**]{.mark} from it when it comes
to gaining knowledge.]{.underline}

"I don't think it explicitly says this, but [it is really about
**helping the U.S.** to build their icebreaking
capability,"]{.underline} he said.

[Whereas Finland and Canada have long histories of manufacturing these
vessels, **America has lagged behind.**]{.underline} For example, the
U.S. Coast Guard has not launched a new heavy icebreaker since 1976.

### Inherency\-\--AT: ICE Pact

President-elect [Donald [Trump]{.mark} on Tuesday [**threw a wrench in
U.S. plans** to build icebreaker vessels]{.mark} with Canada and
Finland,]{.underline} saying [[he told]{.mark} outgoing Canadian Prime
Minister Justin [Trudeau, "We don't need a
partner."]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The [remarks]{.mark}]{.underline}, at a freewheeling press conference
and part of a broader critique of Canada's reliance on the U.S.,
[[**immediately cast a shadow** on the future of]{.mark} the
[I]{.mark}cebreaker [C]{.mark}ollaboration [E]{.mark}ffort
Pact,]{.underline} which was first announced at the NATO summit in
Washington in July.

"I called him, Gov. Trudeau, I said, 'Listen, what would happen if we
didn't subsidize you?' Because we give them a lot of money, we help
them," [Trump said]{.underline}. "As an example, we're buying
icebreakers, and [Canada wants to join us in the buying of
icebreakers]{.underline}. I said, ['We don't really want to have a
partner in the buying of icebreakers. **We don't need a
partner.'"**]{.underline}

Trump also touched on security and trade relations, saying the U.S.
spends "hundreds of billions per year to protect" Canada.

Trump at one point suggested Canada ought to be a U.S. state but said he
was not considering military force to annex it.

"Economic force, because Canada and the United States, that would really
be something," Trump said. "You get rid of that artificially drawn line
and you take a look at what that looks like, and it would also be much
better for national security. Don't forget, we basically protect
Canada."

[The U.S. is pursuing Arctic and Polar icebreakers to boost its aging
fleet,]{.underline} which operates one heavy icebreaker, the Polar Star,
and a medium polar icebreaker, the Healy[. Russia, meanwhile, has dozens
of newer, more advanced ice-breaking ships, dominating sea
traffic.]{.underline} China's presence in the region is also alarming
the rest of the Arctic nation community.

With the idea of sharing supply chains to cut building and maintenance
costs for icebreakers, [the U.S., Canada and Finland agreed under the
ICE Pact to advance industrial cooperation and workforce development and
to find ways to invest in U.S. shipyards.]{.underline}

The initial plan involves building ships at Finland's Helsinki Shipyard
--- owned by Canada's Davie, which has produced half the world's
icebreakers --- before bringing production and jobs to the U.S. The
Coast Guard will also work with Louisiana-based Bollinger Shipyards to
produce the first two American-made heavy icebreakers to join the U.S.
fleet in decades.

A fleet mix analysis conducted by the Coast Guard last year determined
that the service would need a total of eight to nine polar icebreakers
to support Arctic and Antarctic missions. [But
[the C]{.mark}ongressional [B]{.mark}udget [O]{.mark}ffice [found the
cost of]{.mark} three planned [icebreakers]{.mark},]{.underline}
initially estimated at \$2.3 billion in 2019, [[has **risen**]{.mark}
**to approximately \$5.1 billion** --- excluding
maintenance]{.underline}.

At the same time, [[the Coast Guard has struggled]{.underline}]{.mark}
amid the U.S. shipbuilding industry's inexperience [[to finalize a
design]{.mark} for the Polar Security Cutter.]{.underline}

Finnish President Alexander [[Stubb]{.mark} said he [spoke with
Trump]{.mark} in November]{.underline}, and the two discussed the
icebreaker deal [[but nothing about **whether Trump supported
it**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

#### The ICE Pact fails.

**Roque 24**, master\'s degree in conflict transformation from the
University of Basel (Ashley, "Coast Guard commandant praises ICE Pact's
potential, still needs icebreakers 'now," Breaking Defense,
https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/coast-guard-commandant-praises-ice-pacts-potential-still-needs-icebreakers-now/)

[[America's new icebreaker]{.mark} production
[alliance]{.mark}]{.underline} with Canada and Finland
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} "really **[[just
starting]{.underline}]{.mark}**" and [[**it'll be some time** before it
alters the]{.underline}]{.mark} US Coast Guard's near-term race for more
[[high-north]{.mark} capable [vessels]{.mark},]{.underline} according to
the service's commandant.

"My view on what ICE Pact will do for us is it creates broader synergies
beyond just what US ship building capacity can do ... \[and\] will allow
us to leverage lessons and insights and capacity and expertise that the
Finnish and the Canadians have alongside us," Adm. Linda Fagan told
Breaking Defense over the weekend on the sidelines of the Reagan
National Defense Forum.

"[[What]{.underline}]{.mark} that **[[actually
translates]{.underline}]{.mark}** to in the future? It's so new. **[[I
don't know]{.underline}]{.mark}**," she later added.

In July the three nations announced the Icebreaker Collaboration Effort,
or ICE Pact, meant to speed the production of new vessels using Canadian
and Finnish expertise along with America's larger industrial base. In
November the countries inked a joint memorandum of understanding with
key four elements: enhanced information exchange, workforce development
collaboration, engagement with allies and partners, and research and
development.

But the US shipbuilding industrial base is already under strain, and
[[ICE Pact is just taking its first steps]{.underline}]{.mark}.

"The challenge now is leveraging all the goodness that's in ICE Pact to
actually begin to accelerate some of the icebreaker building and
conversation in the country," Fagan said. "[[There's a defense
industrial base reality to this]{.underline}]{.mark}, certainly as it
pertains to shipbuilding and shipyard capacity."

The four-star admiral said that the nations have stood up working groups
to look for collaborative opportunities and nail down just how each
nation can contribute for "actual effectiveness."

Any [[decisions]{.underline}]{.mark}, though, that may impact Coast
Guard or Navy acquisition programs [[will need buy in from Congressional
appropriators and authorizers]{.underline}.]{.mark}

"[[The ICE Pact doesn't impact]{.mark} any of [the **federal acquisition
rules, the Buy American requirements**]{.mark}]{.underline}, all of that
is in place," Fagan said. "We're ... sort of negotiating through this
part of what the working groups are going to need."

[Plans for **large-scale expansion** of]{.underline} Northern Sea Route
trade means that the number of [icebreakers]{.underline} required will
[increase from 10 or 11 to between 15 and 17]{.underline}, according [to
Rosatom Director General Alexei Likhachev.]{.underline} Speaking at the

**plan**]{.underline} 100 and 150 million tonnes and [15 to 17
icebreakers]{.underline} instead of 10 or 11. Therefore, we must
construct them.\" He added: \"An icebreaker does not transport cargo, so
we need a cargo fleet. I understand that we do not have enough capacity
to meet the demand for cargo vessels in advance, and this is where
international cooperation is necessary. We have a very good
understanding of business on the international market. Now we are having

measures to attract young professionals to live and work there. There
are currently a series of Project 22220 nuclear-powered icebreakers
operating - the Arktika, Sibir and Ural - or under construction - the
Yakutia, Chukotka and Leningrad. Last week, over several days a floating
crane was used to load the generator, condenser, turbine and other
components onto the Chukotka. Later this year the Stalingrad will be
laid down. The Project 22220 [vessels]{.underline} are 173 metres long,
34 metres wide and with a height from the waterline to the mainmast of
57 metres. They are [designed to break through ice up to three metres
thick and have a speed of 22 knots in clear water.]{.underline} The
RITM-200 is a pressurised water reactor with a thermal capacity of 175
MW, which converts to 30 MW at the propellers. It is 7.3 metres high
with a diameter of 3.3 metres and an integral layout which its
manufacturers say means it is lighter, more compact and 25 MW more

The service life is 40 years. [There is also a larger nuclear-powered

the first of the proposed Project 10510 nuclear-powered icebreakers. It
will feature two RITM-400 reactors for a propeller power of 120 MW[. It
will be able to penetrate ice up to 4.3 metres thick and clear a channel

Russian President Vladimir Putin also visited the International Arctic
Forum, where he heard from Director General of FSUE GlavSevmorput Sergey
Zybko that at the time there were 50 vessels in the Northern Sea Route
and nine nuclear and non-nuclear icebreakers working. Zybko said that AI
was being used to analyse satellite radar images and he said that
[global warming was not yet making the ice conditions better for the
trade route, which runs the length of Russia\'s northern coast from
Europe to Asia.]{.underline} He said: \"It should be noted that the [ice
conditions have been deteriorating over the past few years.]{.underline}
And although we often hear about global warming, current research by the
Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute does not confirm this. According
to their observations, [no significant changes in ice cover are expected
in the winter-spring period until 2050]{.underline}.\"

In 1867, the U.S. secretary of State, William Seward, struck a deal to
buy Alaska from Russia for 2 cents per acre. Critics panned the deal as
wasteful and labeled it "Seward's Folly." But Seward's strategic
foresight has brought America a bounty of natural resources, a beautiful
new frontier, and a pivotal edge in World War II and in the Cold War.

To this day, the waters off the Alaskan coast supply our nation with
critical petroleum, fish stocks and deep-sea minerals. [Yet, [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is losing strategic ground in the Arctic
to]{.mark} our adversaries [Russia and China]{.mark}. A **[decisive
tool]{.mark}**]{.underline} in that rivalry [[is]{.mark} [the
icebreaker]{.mark}]{.underline}, a vessel uniquely equipped to cut
through deep layers of Arctic ice.

[Russia has the world's largest icebreaker fleet, numbering over 40
total]{.underline} with three more under construction and a dozen
planned in the next decade. [China, too, is building ice
breakers]{.underline} and investing in Arctic infrastructure. [By
contrast, [the U.S.]{.mark} Coast Guard has [just two]{.mark} polar
icebreakers:]{.underline} the Polar Star and the Healy.

Until recently, those two ships divided their efforts at opposite poles
--- the Polar Star resupplying the McMurdo Station in Antarctica, and
the Healy protecting U.S. interests in the Arctic. [A recent shipboard
fire]{.underline} aboard the Healy [has put half of America's polar
icebreaker fleet out of commission.]{.underline} As a result, the Polar
Star is now America's only operational polar icebreaker.

[[This]{.mark} unfortunate turn of events [has created]{.mark} new
[space for Russia and China to **exert maritime influence.**]{.mark}
Both powers are continuing to invest heavily in Arctic-capable assets
[and **erode American influence.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

This summer, the Russian Navy conducted its largest war games exercise
since the Cold War near Alaska. Russia has also reopened over 50
previously closed Soviet military facilities and positioned early
warning radar and missile systems near Alaska.

China is upping its polar capabilities by pouring money into the
construction of a fifth Antarctic research station, completing its
second polar icebreaker and conducting six expeditions to the Arctic. In
recent years China has declared itself a "near-Arctic state," achieved
permanent observer status on the multinational Arctic Council and
announced its "Polar Silk Road" economic ambitions.

[The Arctic is a geopolitical convergence point. Without new investment
in polar capabilities, our adversaries\' influence will
grow.]{.underline} The risk is less protection of U.S. commercial and
scientific vessels, weaker enforcement of international law, and an
increasing threat to our national security.

At the center of U.S. efforts to reverse this trend is the Polar
Security Cutter program. This program will produce a fleet of six new
icebreakers --- including the first heavy icebreakers built in U.S.
shipyards in over 40 years. Congress has already funded the first
vessel, which should undergo sea trials by 2024. The Coast Guard has
requested funding for the second vessel.

[[These ships **cannot come fast enough**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Even so,
the Coast Guard will have to stretch the service of the Polar Star until
at least 2023, more than two decades beyond the ship's expected useful
life.

[President Donald [Trump]{.mark}]{.underline} raised the alarm in June
when he instructed six members of his Cabinet to make recommendations to
achieve "a ready, capable, and available fleet of polar security
icebreakers." The president [[understands that two]{.mark} aged and
broken [icebreakers are a far cry from the needs of the world's]{.mark}
largest trading economy and military [superpower]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Secretary Seward made that historic deal for Alaska 153 years ago. [The
only [folly would be to **cede**]{.mark} **to our adversaries,** through
underinvestment and neglect, [the Arctic advantage]{.mark} the United
States has long enjoyed.]{.underline}

### !\-\--Heg Good

#### Increasing global cooperation avoids a hegemonic country

\[Andrew **Lanthan**; 5/18/**24**; a distinguished scholar of
international security, strategic studies, and political economy; "As
American global hegemony ends, multi-alignment rises";
https://thehill.com/opinion/international/4671482-as-american-global-hegemony-ends-multi-alignment-rises/;
DBSTM\]

[Enter [multi-alignment]{.mark}, a strategic response to this [new
**multipolar** reality]{.mark} that involves [countries forging
partnerships]{.mark} across ideological and geopolitical divides [to
**advance their national interests**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Unlike the rigid alliances of the Cold War,
[m[ulti-alignment]{.underline}]{.mark} [involves a strategic flexibility
that [**empowers** nations to navigate]{.mark} the complexities of [a
multipolar world]{.mark}]{.underline}. These partnerships are often
issue-specific and impermanent, [[allowing countries to
cooperate]{.mark} with different great powers depending on the
context.]{.underline}

For instance, [a nation [might partner with the U.S]{.mark}. on matters
of regional security [while forging **economic ties with
China**]{.mark}.]{.underline} This adaptability ensures that a country's
national interests are prioritized --- if cooperation with a particular
power becomes detrimental, they can shift their focus and seek
partnerships elsewhere.

This [[approach is particularly attractive for **middle
powers**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [These countries, with growing
influence]{.underline} but not the global reach of superpowers, can
leverage their strategic weight to extract benefits from various
partners within the multipolar system; they can [[secure **vital**
resources]{.mark}, [expand their economic]{.mark} [opportunities]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} [exert]{.mark} greater [influence]{.mark} on the
international stage]{.underline}. In essence, multi-alignment allows
middle powers to play multiple sides, [**[maximizing]{.mark}** their
strategic [gains]{.mark} within a multipolar landscape.]{.underline}

The [Middle East is shifting **dramatically** under the influence of
**multi-alignment**]{.underline}. Once a region defined by a rigid
U.S.-led alliance system, the rise of China is rewriting the script. A
powerful illustration of this transformation is China's recent success
in brokering a thaw between regional rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia. This
unprecedented diplomatic feat underscores the transformative power of
multi-alignment, as traditional allies are no longer bound by rigid
geopolitical ties or past membership in a bloc, but are free to pursue
partnerships based on specific interests.

The implications for the Middle East are profound, potentially paving
the way for a more stable regional order. We see this with how Saudi
Arabia, a long-standing American ally, is deepening economic ties with
China for investment and diversification away from oil dependence, while
still maintaining its security relationship with the U.S. Similarly,
Gulf states like the United Arab Emirates have fostered partnerships
with both China and Russia, seeking economic opportunities and
diplomatic support on regional issues. This [m[ulti-alignment
allows]{.underline}]{.mark} [these [states to navigate the
**complexities**]{.mark} of a multipolar world [and **secure** their
interests]{.mark} within the **new power dynamic**.]{.underline}

In Southeast Asia, countries like Vietnam and Indonesia have long
balanced relations between the U.S. and China, but China's growing
assertiveness in the South China Sea has spurred a reevaluation.
Vietnam, despite its communist ideology, has strengthened its defense
ties with the U.S. while maintaining economic relations with China.
Indonesia, meanwhile, seeks to maintain its neutrality but has also
engaged in joint military exercises with both the U.S. and China. This
[[multi-alignment strategy]{.mark} [allows]{.mark} these [countries to
**hedge**]{.mark} [against]{.mark} Chinese
[dominance]{.mark}]{.underline} while ensuring access to vital markets
in a multipolar economic landscape.

The rise of multi-alignment within a multipolar world presents both
opportunities and challenges for international peace and security. On
the one hand, it offers a more nuanced approach to global challenges.
With power diffused across multiple actors, decisionmaking becomes less
centralized and more responsive to specific regional contexts. This
allows for solutions tailored to the unique needs of each situation,
rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. Multi-alignment can also
incentivize cooperation between former rivals on shared threats like
climate change or pandemics, encouraging countries to collaborate on
solutions despite past geopolitical differences.

On the other hand, the erosion of clear-cut geopolitical blocs presents
potential risks. The international landscape can become more fluid and
unpredictable, making it difficult to anticipate the actions of states
no longer bound by rigid alliances. This fluidity can intensify
competition for influence between major powers, potentially leading to
proxy conflicts and heightened regional tensions. The lack of strong
alliances can make it more challenging to coordinate responses to global
crises; forging consensus to address a major crisis could become a more
cumbersome process.

The rise of multi-alignment necessitates a fundamental shift in how
international relations are conducted. Major powers must transition from
a zero-sum competition mindset to one that fosters more agile frameworks
that address the concerns of a wider range of actors, not just
traditional allies, to ensure stability and navigate the complexities of
multipolarity.

[International [institutions]{.mark} also [require]{.mark}
[adaptation]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Strengthening [regional
organizations]{.mark} can [provide]{.mark} [**crucial platforms**
for]{.mark} dialogue and [cooperation]{.mark} on issues of shared
concern]{.underline}. Fostering dialogue across geopolitical divides,
even between former rivals, becomes essential.

The [[success of multi-alignment]{.mark} in fostering peace and security
[hinges on a **delicate balancing act**]{.mark}]{.underline}**.** While
fostering cooperation across geopolitical divides is crucial, it's
equally important for regional and global great powers to establish and
maintain a stable balance of power, as unchecked dominance by any single
power --- or even the pursuit of regional or global dominance --- can
breed instability.

The [[key lies in]{.mark} **maintaining
[equilibrium]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Major powers can contribute by
engaging in strategic dialogues, promoting regional security initiatives
and avoiding actions that tilt the balance towards unilateral advantage.
This [[doesn't preclude competition]{.mark}, but simply ensures it
[occurs within a **framework that prioritizes peaceful
coexistence**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The success of multi-alignment hinges on a commitment to strategic
agility and a nuanced understanding of national interests. Major powers
must prioritize actions that promote a stable balance, avoiding
unilateral maneuvers that could trigger regional tensions or ignite
proxy conflicts. By embracing this new dynamic and working
collaboratively within a framework of mutual respect, the international
community can leverage the multipolar shift to create a more peaceful
and prosperous world order.

**[[The time for dominance is over]{.underline}]{.mark}**; the time for
a strategic balancing act has begun.

[The Arctic alarmists perceive Russian Arctic **expansionist

Crimea while likewise extending China's actions in the South China Sea
as a **predictive analog** for their Arctic intent]{.underline}. Some
scholars dispute the "South China Sea as a precursor to the Arctic"
argument and further question the existence of a Russo- Sino alliance.
Noting Russia--China tensions[, Arctic alarmists insist that Russia and
China exhibit **band wagoning** behaviors and seek to supplant the
United States as the global hegemon, perceiving the Arctic as an
**opportunistic avenue** to do so]{.underline}. For Arctic alarmists,

the US Air Force's 2020 Arctic Strategy, [calls for an **expanded
infrastructure base** in addition to power projection, vigilance,
deterrence through cooperation, and cold weather
preparation]{.underline}. Arctic alarmists remind us that Russia
operates nuclear- powered submarines in the Arctic, has dozens of
military facilities in its Arctic territory, maintains a dedicated
Arctic military command, and ﬂies bomber sorties throughout the Arctic
regularly. [**Russia** is already **years ahead** of the United States
in the Arctic.]{.underline} To alarmists, Russian military eﬀorts are [a
precursor to controlling the high north, challenging American command of
the commons, **asserting inﬂuence**, and even holding the US homeland at
risk]{.underline}. Already, [Russian military capabilities threaten the
American homeland due to their unstoppable hypersonic ballistic missiles
based in the Arctic.]{.underline} In the words of former US Northern
Command Commander General Terrance O'Shaughnessy: "The Homeland is not a
sanctuary" the way it once was. Scholars will continue to debate whether
the Arctic matters for the United States such that it should compel
military involvement. There will continue to be disputes over Chinese
and Russian Arctic ambition relative to American interests. These
discussions will grapple with whether Russia aggressively seeks oﬀensive
expansion or merely defensive security for its northern territories.
Others will contend with whether China---as a self- proclaimed "near-
Arctic state"---actually desires Arctic inﬂuence via its Polar Silk Road
(part of China's major economic Belt and Road \[BRI\] initiative) or
merely seeks to advance its own economic position via access to Arctic
resources and alternative shipping lanes connecting Asia and Europe.34
We will continue reading about Russian icebreakers outnumbering American
icebreaker capabilities 20-to-1, or even 40-to-1---the so- called
icebreaker gap---and what the United States should (or should not) do
about such a capability imbalance.35 [Moreover, Arctic alarmists will
point to the continued Russian military buildup of Arctic
infrastructure, the questionably legal control Russia claims over the
Northern Sea Route, and the 2014 establishment of the Northern Fleet and
its Arctic focus]{.underline}---coupled with Moscow's planning and
execution of thousands of Arctic exercises and infrastructure
modernization efforts---as points of attention for the evolving Arctic
signiﬁcance. 36For this side, Moscow's economic and military commitment
to the Arctic indicates signiﬁcant interest and intent such that the
United States must not dismiss it as irrelevant to future international
security, especially considering the United States is an Arctic state
with a national coastline on Arctic shores. We must reject the false
notion of Arctic exceptionalism regarding the great- power competition
of the twenty- ﬁrst century. Instead, we need to adopt the notion of
Arctic essentialism that sees the Arctic for its value in the
international security chess game, not for the utopic zone of peace we
hope it will be. Focusing the Arctic Debate on Harsh Realities of
Military Power. The Arctic is the only coastal region of the United
States with an active strategic competitor conducting regular military

spread across Alaska and Canada meant to identify incoming missile
threats]{.underline}. The NWS [relies on **1980s

As the name suggests, [[an icebreaker ship]{.mark} is a vessel that [has
been designed to]{.mark}\...[break ice]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Specifically [[so that other vessels have a clear path]{.mark} through
icy and frozen waters]{.underline}**[. [This enables trade to keep
moving and stops the global supply chain grinding to a
halt]{.underline}.]{.mark}**  

That's the short answer but if you would like to know more about
icebreaker boats, how ice breaker vessels work and how they're powered -
and why they can break through ice but other cargo and container ships
can't, keep reading!

ships, crane vessels and cargo and container ships. But for now, let's
take a deep dive into icebreakers.

What is an icebreaker ship and how is it different to regular ships?

As we know, an icebreaker ship has been designed to clear a safe passage
through icy, ice-covered and frozen waters for other vessels.

[[This enables trade routes to continue operating]{.mark} during the
winter months and [in harsh,]{.mark} permanently frozen [conditions that
other vessels would struggle to navigate.]{.mark}]{.underline}

And [[although vessels]{.underline}]{.mark} that predominantly operate
in areas that are frozen most of, or all of, the year round [[are often
strengthened to be able to cope with]{.mark} sailing in [icy waters,
they don't normally have the power required to break the ice by
themselves]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Ice breakers key to opening trade routes

Robert **Hammitt 17**, Fellow at Polar Research and Policy Initiative,
researcher at Carleton University with a focus in Europe and Eurasian
studies, 1/24/27, "Icebreakers: an overview",
https://polarconnection.org/icebreakers/ //maeve

Whether owned and operated by national governments, state-owned
enterprises, or in private hands, some icebreakers and fleets are
primarily focused on commercial operations. [[Icebreakers have engaged
in many]{.mark} types of [commercial
activities]{.mark}]{.underline}[:]{.mark}

[escorting and [supporting cargo vessels engaged in Arctic
shipping]{.mark};]{.underline}

[[protecting oil and gas operations]{.mark} from ice;]{.underline}

[**[keeping ports and their approaches open to allow trade to
flow]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

In some sub-arctic waters, such as the Baltic Sea, seasonal
**[[commercial icebreaking is critical to enable trade through the
winter]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In addition, the Soviet and Russian
governments have always relied on the Northern Sea Route along Russia's
Arctic coast to bring natural resources out of Siberia and the far north
and to bring goods into those communities.

In more recent years, Russia has focused on expanding the Northern Sea
Route. This expansion is linked to increased mining and energy
extraction, especially on the Yamal Peninsula. Russia has also promoted
the Arctic route as an alternate global shipping route, offering a
considerably shorter voyage between northern Europe and East Asia than
the traditional Suez Canal route. However, to date, the particular
challenges and risks of this route have prevented its rapid growth.

[[Icebreakers are]{.mark} also [used to support]{.mark} oil- and
[natural gas]{.mark}-drilling and [exploration]{.mark}]{.underline}.
During its operations off the North Slope of Alaska, Shell leased the
privately-owned Aiviq and the MSV Fennica owned by Finland's Arctia
Offshore. In addition to protecting the exploration fleet from
unexpected ice conditions, icebreakers are necessary to provide access
to year-round production platforms, such as the Goliat platform and
Prirazlomnaya platform in Norwegian and Russian waters respectively.
Finally, [[icebreakers are an important point of oil-spill
response]{.underline}]{.mark}. Fennica was an important part of Shell's
Alaska operations because it carried a capping stack, necessary to close
a gushing well in the event of a blowout. Because US regulations for
Arctic drilling require that operators have the capacity to deal with a
blowout before the end of the season, a late-season disaster would force
response operations to continue even as winter ice returns.

Similarly, this fall's cruise through North America's Northwest Passage
by the cruise ship Crystal Serenity hired the RRS Ernest
Shackleton, operated by the British Antarctic Society, to escort it
through the Canadian Archipelago (the Shackleton is an ice-strengthened
ship for polar operations, rather than a true icebreaker). As with
Shell's icebreaker fleet, the Shackleton is intended to provide a safety
margin if severe ice conditions develop, rather than because Crystal
Cruises expects to travel through pack ice conditions.

As these examples demonstrate[, [commercial icebreaking operations are
driven by]{.mark} the [economic needs of shipping
companies]{.mark}]{.underline} and other maritime operators. This sets
an upper limit on the necessary upper icebreaking capacity, barring
emergency situations, since commercial operators are only willing to
face a certain degree of risk before their operations become
uneconomical. In addition, the world fleet of ice-strengthened
commercial ships, capable of safely travelling in heavier ice
conditions, is relatively small. Although more Polar-class ships will be
built, many operators, such as Russia's Norilsk Nickel, are looking
toward cargo ships with their own icebreaking capacity, able to operate
separately from an icebreaker-supported convoy. This tendency will not
entirely obviate the need for commercial icebreakers, but is a sign that
[[icebreaker-led convoys shouldn't be taken for granted as the form of
future Arctic shipping]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### It attracts investors and will become an impetus for international trade.

As with the Arctic itself, the status of the Northwest Passage was given
limited attention until the latter part of the 20th century. The reason
for that, as with other ice-covered areas of the Arctic, is that no
particular interest was shown to utilize the route for transport and the
conditions were thought to be dangerous. [The tables have certainly
turned]{.underline}.

While oil and gas development in the Arctic is touched on, [[use of the
Northwest Passage]{.mark} as a supply and service route to and from Asia
[is a **big part of the future Arctic´s plan**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[New business opportunities]{.mark}, [connected]{.mark} not only
[to]{.mark} the Arctic´s [oil]{.mark} and gas resources but also the
[iron ore, diamonds, gold and fisheries, encourage investors from **key
business sectors** to improve technology in order to develop better and
more sufficient infrastructure in the northern hemisphere]{.mark}.
Deepwater ports, road infrastructure, greater search and rescue presence
and increased graduation rate among Inuit youth in order to increase the
growth of northern workforce, are the key objectives for scientists and
policy makers to be taken into account.]{.underline}

The Global Outlook

[[Nowadays the Northwest Passage is seen as a **revolutionary** opening
for large scale transportation by ships from the North Pacific to the
North Atlantic Ocean]{.mark}.]{.underline} Despite the dispute between
United States and Canada, Northwest Passage is seen as a global issue to
affect trans-Arctic shipping operations of many countries. [[It is
predicted that in near future, it will provide an impetus for
international commercial usage]{.underline}.]{.mark}

Utilizing the Northwest Passage is beneficial for economic reasons and
climate reasons. [[The]{.mark} [Northwest Passage]{.mark}]{.underline}
is 7,000 kilometers shorter when traveling between the east and west
coasts of the United States than using the Panama Canal.41 [This [will
cut **costs for shipping**]{.mark} companies [in]{.mark} numerous ways,
but the most notable expenses are [fuel and crew costs]{.mark}.42
[Less]{.mark} storage for fuel and [supplies on boa]{.mark}rd also
[allows for **more cargo to be transported**]{.mark}.43 Since the
Northwest Passage is not manmade, [it will be able to accommodate larger
ships than the Panama Canal, resulting in further economic and climate
benefits]{.mark}.44 [The shorter route]{.mark} resulting in less fuel
being used also [results in **less greenhouse gas emissions**]{.mark}

Costs and climate benefits are not the only positives that can be reaped
from the usage of the Northwest Passage. [It has been discovered that
[25% of the untapped oil on the globe is located in the Arctic
region]{.mark}.46 There are also a number of other natural resources
that are plentiful in the Arctic region.47 The [utilization of the
Northwest Passage]{.mark} will make the Arctic region more familiar and
accessible to humans and the melting of the ice [will make the
**extraction of these resources easier**]{.mark}.]{.underline}48
Additionally, the transportation of these resources is much simpler if
the Northwest Passage runs through the Arctic and can take the resources
wherever they need to go.49 [[The exploration of Arctic]{.mark} waters
and the strategies [use]{.mark}d to combat them such as **[advanced ice
breaking techniques]{.mark}** and [Arctic navigation]{.mark}
[could]{.mark} also benefit other geographical areas in Arctic climates,
providing new avenues to harvest other natural resources or
[open]{.mark}ing [up **new waterways in the Eastern

### I/L\-\--Trade\-\--Econ Terminal

#### Trade sustains key sectors in the US economy\-\--bolstering resilience.

from Georgetown University, an MA in international affairs from American

One of the most significant challenges to defending trade is the
reductive nature of campaign sound bites. Trade produces a range of
benefits, some of which are obvious, but many others that are not.
Politicians often complain that trade is just about expanding people's
ability to buy cheap goods like toys, clothing and furniture. [However,
[trade]{.mark} also [bolsters]{.mark} [the ability]{.mark} of businesses
[to access]{.mark} affordable, [high-quality parts]{.mark} and
components that they use [to make products]{.mark} [to sell in the
U]{.mark}nited]{.underline} [S]{.mark}tates [[and around the
world.]{.mark}]{.underline} Those parts that we bring in from other
countries, such as axles, batteries and steel pipes, make up half of all
imports. **[This means that [much of what we trade is not consumer
goods]{.mark} such as phones and furniture[, but essential inputs to the
U.S. economy]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[Take the iconic American]{.underline} truck --- the Ford F-150. In
addition to American labor and components, Ford relies on foreign parts
for producing the F-150: about a third of all its parts are sourced from
abroad[. It is then sold in the United States and other countries around
the world.]{.underline}

Popular demand for the F-150, both in the United States and abroad,
supports 3,800 jobs at the Dearborn plant where the trucks are
assembled. But the economic benefits are not just limited to this single
plant. In fact, Ford employs 59,000 hourly workers around the country to
manufacture its line of cars and trucks. Along with auto workers that
work on the assembly line, Ford employs a range of other workers, such
as product designers and software engineers that research and develop
the software that is embedded in all modern vehicles.

Ford Credit also sells automotive financial products to finance the
purchase of Ford vehicles. Americans understand the value of those jobs,
and evidence shows that automotive jobs pay higher wages than those in
other manufacturing industries. The importance of trade to those jobs is
rarely talked about on the campaign trail, however.

[Many companies like Ford make a wide range of sophisticated products
using both American and foreign inputs that are in high demand at home
and abroad. **By taking advantage of trading opportunities, these
[companies create]{.mark} [a lot of American jobs across a diverse range
of industries]{.mark} [and are a source of strength for the U.S.
economy.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[In fact, U.S. firms that [**trade in goods support half of all jobs in
the economy**, and **almost three-quarters of those jobs are at firms
that both export and import goods**]{.mark}. These [exporter-importer
firms]{.mark} [are major employers across key sectors]{.mark} of the
economy, employing over half of all workers in [manufacturing, retail,
transportation, utilities, wholesale, and information]{.mark}. The
things they trade also increasingly include higher-technology goods and
services.]{.underline}

[Trade continues to be central to job growth in U.S. manufacturing, as
well. In the past decade, total manufacturing employment increased by
about 10%.]{.underline} [**During the same period, while [non-traders
continued to shrink]{.mark}, [goods-trading manufacturers created more
jobs on net.]{.mark} Because the share of goods traders in
[manufacturing employment averages about 85%]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} this
recovery would not have occurred if all manufacturers grew at the same
(negative) rate as non-traders.]{.underline}

#### International exports and imports are directly correlated with the economy.

//wenxi

Over the past 50 years, [international [trade has become an
**increasingly important** feature of the U.S.
economy.]{.mark}]{.underline} The U.S. has been running a trade
deficit---that is that the total value of imports to the country has
exceeded the value of U.S. exports---every year since 1975. However,
this does not represent a decline in the country's exports. On the
contrary, both exports and imports have more than doubled since the
beginning of this period (see chart).

[This [reflects the **greater integration of the U**]{.mark}**nited
[S]{.mark}tates in the world economy**, something that has been
happening worldwide---world trade relative to world GDP has increased
from 26% in 1970 to 63% in 2022.]{.underline}

[Moreover, [there is a]{.mark} **[high correlation]{.mark} (greater than
90%) [between exports and imports]{.mark}**---typically [when]{.mark}
U.S. [exports]{.mark} to the rest of the world [are declining, U.S.
imports]{.mark} of foreign [goods tend to decline as well]{.mark}. [This
is especially the case in crisis]{.mark} years like 2008--2009 and
2020.]{.underline} The global financial and economic crisis and the
onset of COVID saw both a contraction of the United States economy (and
other economies) and of world trade.

The [Polar regions]{.underline} (the [[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} and
Antarctic) [are [seeing **more natural resources and shipping
lanes**]{.mark} become available [due to **reduced ice coverage** as
well as **increased presence from China and
Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The U.S. [[Coast Guard must]{.mark} also
**[increase]{.mark} its [presence to protect U.S. sovereignty
and]{.mark} economic [interests]{.mark}**. [Icebreakers are
**essential**]{.mark} **for providing this presence in the Polar
region**]{.underline}**s**. However, [the Coast Guard's icebreaker
[fleet **currently consists of only two ships**]{.mark}]{.underline}:
one medium and one heavy polar icebreaker. [This [capacity is **unable**
to meet the]{.mark} growing national [requirement]{.mark} for
icebreaking and presence.]{.underline}

In the Antarctic, [heavy [icebreakers]{.mark} **specifically are
[necessary]{.mark}** [to support the]{.mark} **[N]{.mark}ational
[S]{.mark}cience [F]{.mark}oundation** with the **annual resupply of the
McMurdo research station**]{.underline}, the primary research facility
in the Antarctic, and to support requests from the U.S. Department of
State for enforcement of the Antarctic Treaty of 1959 because the thick
ice makes it difficult to access this area.

Current Economic and Security Environment in the Polar Regions

As an Arctic nation, the [U.S. has [important economic interests]{.mark}
in the region, [including]{.mark} a large exclusive **[economic
zone]{.mark}**]{.underline} (EEZ) [containing numerous natural resources
like minerals, oil, and gas]{.underline}. Approximately 13 percent of
undiscovered oil resources and 30 perecnt of undiscovered gas resources
are located in the Arctic.2

[[Melting ice]{.mark} has [opened up]{.mark} seasonal arctic shipping
lanes for **potentially [more efficient transit of goods]{.mark}**
between Asia and North America]{.underline}, and has provided greater
access to large deposits of energy and mineral resources that were not
previously accessible. Adventure tourism and transpolar flights are also
increasing the activity levels in the Arctic.

Additionally, [[Russia has made **aggressive claims**]{.mark} to natural
resources under the icecap, arguing that its continental shelf extends
far **[beyond its recognized territorial limits]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark}
has [invested]{.mark} **heavily in [military]{.mark} [assets]{.mark}
capable of operating in the Arctic**.]{.underline}3

[[China]{.mark} is [increasing]{.mark} its [presence]{.mark} in both
Polar regions [as well]{.mark}]{.underline}, sailing its icebreaker
through the Arctic recently and constructing a second icebreaker.4

These [[activities **increase the level of comp**]{.mark}**etition** and
could [place]{.mark} U.S. [resources at risk]{.mark} for exploitation by
foreign powers [if the **U.S. cannot effectively shape
events**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The Icebreaker Fleet

Icebreakers perform nine of the eleven Coast Guard statutory missions,
including law enforcement, search and rescue, and defense missions. The
only two missions they do not perform are migrant and drug interdiction
operations, simply because those do not occur in the Polar regions.
[[Icebreakers are the **primary** U.S. instrument]{.mark} in polar
[international coop]{.mark}eration, [competition]{.mark}, [and conflict
deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}.5

Briefing with author at Coast Guard Headquarters by U.S. Coast Guard
Arctic and Icebreaker Personnel, February 16, 2018.

The [[U.S. cannot shape events in an area **it cannot physically
access**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The [[current]{.mark} icebreaker [fleet is **incapable**]{.mark} of
effectively meeting current mission requirements]{.underline}. From 2010
to 2016, the U.S. only fulfilled 78 percent of icebreaking requests.6

The [Coast Guard [currently operates **one heavy**]{.mark} **polar
[icebreaker]{.mark}**,]{.underline} the Polar Star, and one medium polar
icebreaker, the Healy. The Coast Guard's other heavy polar icebreaker,
the Polar Sea, is no longer operational and serves as spare parts for
the Polar Star.

Commissioned in 1976, Polar Star was designed for a 30-year service
life. The Polar Star requires extensive dry-dock maintenance following
the annual resupply of the McMurdo research station in the Antarctic,
making this its only annual mission. It completed a service life
extension in 2012, designed to extend its service to 2023, when the
first new icebreaker is due to be completed.7

Even after undergoing this maintenance cycle, [it is [**unclear**
whether the icebreaker will last]{.mark}]{.underline} until then,
creating a possible capability gap.8

While the Healy, commissioned in August 2000, is more modern than the
Polar Star, it has less icebreaking capability, and struggles to support
heavy icebreaking operations like the Antarctic McMurdo resupply, and is
incapable of reaching certain areas of the Arctic in all seasons.9

[It can only provide seasonal presence in the Arctic as **it cannot
break through thick ice**]{.underline} (greater than 4.5 feet) at a
sustained speed.

Fleet Requirements

In order to assure the U.S. meets its strategic objectives in the Polar
regions, the Coast Guard needs a fleet of icebreakers. Its official
requirement calls for up to six new polar-class icebreakers, three heavy
and three medium. Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Zukunft acknowledges
that some flexibility comes with that requirement, as six heavy
icebreakers would better fulfill all of the mission requirements.10

The requirement itself comes from the 2010 High Latitude Study, which
the Department of Homeland Security affirmed in a Mission Needs
Statement in June 2013.11

Center for Strategic and International Studies, "U.S. Coast Guard:
Priorities for the Future."

A fleet of six new polar-class icebreakers would allow year-round access
to the Arctic and redundancy and self-rescue capability, as well as the
ability to meet national strategic objectives in the Antarctic.12

Briefing with author at Coast Guard Headquarters by U.S. Coast Guard
Arctic and Icebreaker Personnel, February 16, 2018.

[The [Coast Guard]{.mark} partially based this requirement on the
concept commonly used by the U.S. Navy that it [takes **three ships** to
ensure **one ship** is]{.mark} constantly
[deployed]{.mark}]{.underline}. Typically, one ship is deployed, another
is in training, and the final ship is undergoing major maintenance.13

\"Considering how quickly we\'ve seen U.S.-Canadian relations sour since

[[it\'s easy to imagine]{.mark} [how,]{.mark} historically, [trade

and en**hance the possibility of military
conflict**]{.mark},\"]{.underline} said Exeter University historian Dr.
Marc-William Palen, author of Pax Economica: Left-Wing Visions of a Free
Trade World.

\"Of course, this gets into a gray area surrounding correlation versus
causation[, but most peace workers and anti-imperialists since the
mid-19th century have argued that protective tariffs, embargoes, and
sanctions lead to trade wars and quickly turn allies into
enemies.\"]{.underline}

Among the earliest examples were the economic sanctions and trade
restrictions imposed by Athens before 430 B.C. on the city-state of
Megara, an ally of Sparta, under the so-called Megarian Decree: a factor
in the ensuing [[Peloponnesian wars]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Other wars [linked to tariffs,]{.mark} [trade and taxe]{.mark}s include
those [between the English and Dutc]{.mark}h in the 17th century, [the
American Revolutionary War]{.mark} and the [war of
1812]{.mark}]{.underline}---after the British stopped Americans
accessing lucrative foreign markets. [Palen also cited the [tariff war
between Austria-Hungary and Serbia]{.mark} as a [factor in the lead-up
to World War I.]{.mark}]{.underline}

\"[[History is littered with]{.mark} examples of [**trade disputes

[[The Government Accountability Office]{.mark} has [repeatedly

delays]{.mark} and cost increases. A significant example is
the Constellation-class frigate]{.underline}. A parent design originally
was chosen for the frigate, to reduce risk and shorten the path to
design maturity, but later design changes have delayed delivery by
years.8 

[[**Conversely, the fast response cutter** stands out for its success in

[[For far too long,]{.mark} [the United States neglected our maritime
industries]{.mark} and the critical role they play in our national and
economic security -- [this ends with the SHIPS for America
Act]{.mark}]{.underline}...This bill represents the most substantial and
comprehensive approach to have America compete and lead globally, and
I'm proud to lead it alongside Senator Kelly, Senator Young, and
Representative Waltz. Today, less than 200 oceangoing ships fly the
American flag, the SHIPS for America Act will empower our shipyards and
marine merchants to uphold our country's status as a leader in the
maritime industry," Congressman Garamendi commented.

With China's growing influence in the global maritime sector,
strengthening the U.S. Merchant Marine is essential for maintaining U.S.
dominance in international commerce, according to the act. In times of
conflict[, [the U.S. Merchant Marine will be vital for transporting
goods and military cargo]{.mark}, while in peacetime[, it will fortify
supply chains and ensure economic resilience. The introduction of this
bill represents a strategic effort to rebuild the U.S. maritime
industry]{.mark}, [securing]{.mark} both [national security and global
competitiveness]{.mark}, the statement reads]{.underline}.

Among other things, the bill calls for a commercial cargo preference,
requiring that within 15 years, 10% of all cargo imported into the
United States from China be imported on U.S.-flagged ships. What is
more, it says that a U.S.-flagged vessel shall be given priority at any
U.S. port ahead of a waiting vessel of a foreign country.

"This legislation will create the favorable environment needed by the
builders, investors, and technologists who stand ready to strengthen
America's maritime industry. This thoughtfully crafted bill combines the
vibes of re-vitalization with tangible tax incentives that define
reality for industry," Austin Gray, Blue Water Autonomy Co-Founder and
Chief Strategy Officer, said.

"[**[The SHIPS for America Act is a transformative piece of
legislation]{.mark}** [that will bolster the United States']{.mark}
commercial competitiveness and [military readiness on the high
seas.]{.mark}]{.underline} Not only will [[this bipartisan
bill]{.mark}]{.underline} protect existing jobs in maritime and allied
trades, but it [[will lead to a renaissance of the American maritime
workforce]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Maritime Trades Department, AFL-CIO
offers our full support of this legislation," Mark A. Clements, Jr.,
Executive Secretary Treasurer of the Maritime Trades Department,
AFL-CIO, concluded.

Earlier this month, [[the U.S. government published a new action plan to
steer its maritime sector toward a sustainable
future]{.underline}]{.mark}. "An Action Plan for Maritime Energy and
Emissions Innovation", released this December, builds on the U.S.

One of the [[biggest challenge]{.mark}s [facing the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates'
[[capability]{.mark} and capacity to defend its interests [in the far
north is]{.mark} the **dearth of [icebreakers]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[Icebreakers are **imperative** to]{.mark} the [national
security]{.mark} of the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and its Arctic territories.]{.underline} Their
[[importance is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[growing]{.mark} due to the
continued melting of the polar ice caps]{.underline}, the [encroachment
of non-Arctic nations]{.underline} to the region, including China, [and
heightened tensions over]{.underline} pre-existing [territorial disputes
and new economic opportunities]{.underline} in the Arctic. However,
despite their importance, [the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates' [fleet of icebreakers has been severely
neglected.]{.underline}

[Icebreakers are indispensable to the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [for a multitude of reasons]{.underline}. Not only
do [[they keep trade routes free from]{.mark} winter [sea ice and
escort]{.mark} shipping [vessels]{.mark} safely]{.underline} through
ice-covered passages, but they also [[help supply winter
bases]{.underline}]{.mark}, [oil rigs]{.underline}, [drill
sites]{.underline}, [[and scientific missions]{.underline}]{.mark} with
the necessary equipment and cargo [year-round]{.underline}. With the
retreating northern ice caps, [global shipping is increasingly using
northern routes]{.underline} for Asia to European trade bypassing the
Panama and Suez canal. These [shifts can drastically cut shipping times
but also allow nations with a significant arctic fleet to hold global
trade at risk.]{.underline}

The [icebreakers also [serve the **vitally important role** of
protecting energy claims and keeping fisheries from]{.mark} foreign
[exploitation]{.mark}]{.underline}. The U.S. Geological
Survey estimates that [the Arctic holds over 90 billion barrels of oil
and 1,669 trillion cubic feet of gas]{.underline}, the majority of which
is commercially viable. Additionally, [Arctic fisheries offer a
vast]{.underline}, and growing, [source of wealth for Arctic
nations]{.underline} --- the average annual catch value is estimated at
over \$500 million, another [incentive for non-arctic states to encroach
on the region]{.underline}. Just last year a massive Chinese fishing
fleet encroached on U.S. territorial waters with no regard for
international law or sustainable fishing regulations.

[[Icebreakers]{.mark} often [serve as moving **research
institutions**]{.mark} and platforms [with teams conducting]{.mark}
scientific research in the Arctic, including [vital climate
change-]{.mark}focused **[research]{.mark}**]{.underline} helping to
tackle one of the region's largest threats. [[The]{.underline}]{.mark}
simple [[**presence** of icebreakers]{.mark} in the Arctic also [sends
an **important message** to]{.mark} potential [adversarial nations
showcasing]{.mark} the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates' [**readiness and willingness** to defend its
interests in the region.]{.underline}

Despite these growing needs, [the [U.S]{.mark}.]{.underline} Coast Guard
[[currently only operates **two** icebreakers]{.underline}]{.mark}, the
Polar Star (already 10 years over its 30-year life expectancy) and Healy
(which suffered an electrical fire in 2020 and was only recently
repaired), both diesel-powered. The only other two U.S.-based
icebreakers are privately owned or operated by the University of Alaska.

In comparison, [[China operates **two**]{.underline}]{.mark} (and is
developing a third), while [[Russia]{.mark}'s armed forces
[operate]{.mark} at least **[46]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- [including
**three** that are **nuclear-powered**]{.underline}, extending both
their power and durability. These numbers do not take into account those
currently under construction or planned, and both nations are investing
heavily in expanding their fleets. Russia has also re-militarized a
dozen Cold War-era arctic bases to expand its naval presence in the
region and to use as berths for its numerous active icebreakers.

[[NATO allies]{.underline}]{.mark} in the region, such as Norway and
Canada, also [[own icebreaker fleets]{.underline}]{.mark}. [However,
[none of them are nuclear-powered]{.mark}]{.underline}. Norway's fleet
is focused on territorial defense against increasingly aggressive
Russian incursions while Canada's fleet is currently comprised of
smaller vessels focusing on scientific research and search and rescue
efforts. [Thus, [the U.S. **cannot rely on its**]{.mark} **Northern or
European [allies ]{.mark}**[for defense posturing]{.mark} in the
Arctic]{.underline}. This [[lack of a substantial U.S. fleet]{.mark} of
icebreakers, the **[absence of nuclear-powered vessels]{.mark}**, and
[reliance on allied icebreaker posturing]{.mark} in the region [is a
**major flaw**]{.mark} in the US national security strategy and
defensive umbrella, [which needs to be **addressed as quickly as
possible**]{.mark} and is an **important strategic investment** the
United States needs to make **immediately**.]{.underline}

Currently, the two Coast Guard icebreakers fall under the jurisdiction
of the Department of Homeland Security whose budget is anemic compared
to the Department of Defense. The Coast Guard does not have the budget
to obtain enough icebreakers to contest Russian or Chinese presence in
the Arctic --- each heavy icebreaker has an average cost of
approximately \$800 million. While, accumulating the same number of
icebreakers as Russia is unnecessary, [moving forward all potential
solutions to securing America's North requires]{.underline} the purchase
of [icebreakers]{.underline}, regardless of their status: new or used.
Coast Guard Commandant Karl Schultz has stated that "a fleet of nine
U.S.-flagged icebreakers" would be sufficient to meet our economic and
security needs in the far north. Thankfully, Congress has already
initiated expanding America's arctic security program by authorizing the
construction of six new Polar Security Cutters (PSCs), three heavy and
three medium icebreakers. However, it is only actively funding the first
four.

The next vital step to securing the North is to fully fund and expedite
the construction of these six PSCs, especially given the fact that the
first PSC is currently planned to be delivered only in late 2024 if it
stays on schedule. This is extremely important as expanding the current
fleet's missions comes with opportunity costs, thus necessitating a
larger fleet to be able to cover all possible icebreaker missions in the
region.

Another longer-term option, which can also be done simultaneously to the
PSC program, is to increase the available funding for the Coast Guard,
specifically focused on Arctic security, to establish partnerships with
private corporations to design and construct the United States' first
nuclear-powered icebreaking vessel. While more expensive, [[**nuclear
icebreakers** come with many **benefits**]{.mark} over diesel-powered
vessels, including both [longevity]{.mark}, [range]{.mark}, and power,
including increasingly vital, [soft power]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[With]{.underline} the additional range and longevity of [nuclear
icebreakers comes a [reduced need]{.mark} for the United States [to
build expensive]{.mark} and difficult to maintain [arctic
bases]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [the icebreakers become de facto mobile
bases. Additionally, the nuclear-powered ships [can conduct
longer]{.mark} and more [missions, **cementing U.S.
positioning**]{.mark} **in the region**.]{.underline}

[[A]{.underline}]{.mark} different and [[**swifter approach** would
involve]{.mark} working with [the]{.mark}]{.underline} Department of the
**[[Navy]{.underline}]{.mark}** to authorize the purchase of an
icebreaker under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Navy. [This would not only
expand the Navy's mission to include patrolling of the far North but
could also lead to **involving NATO forces in the region**.]{.underline}
This would also be a welcome step to counteract Russia's
recent decision to establish a new Arctic fleet within their navy,
acting as [a strong signal of **America's willingness** and readiness to
defend its northern territories and those of its allies.]{.underline}

Professor Ryu Min-cheol of Korea Maritime & Ocean University noted that
expanding Arctic routes could lead to more orders. Korea holds an
advantage in building commercial icebreakers, while Japan mainly
constructs research vessels.

[Icebreakers are classified by their icebreaking ability]{.underline}.
Advanced Arc-7 class ships can break ice up to 2.1 meters thick and move
in both directions using special propulsion systems. Korea has
significant experience in this area. In 2005, Samsung Heavy Industries
built the world's first two-way icebreaking oil tanker. In 2019, Samsung
signed a contract with Russia's Zvezda Shipyard to design and partially
build 15 Arc-7 icebreaking LNG carriers, with components made in South
Korea and assembled in Russia.

Icebreaker Capabilities and Importance of Arctic Routes

Hanwha Ocean, formerly Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering, has
delivered 15 Arc-7 icebreaking LNG carriers for Russia's Yamal LNG
project and is building six more for global clients. In contrast, Japan
has primarily built smaller icebreakers for research, such as the Mirai
2 and the Shirase, which are much smaller than the large commercial
vessels used in Arctic shipping.

A Korean shipbuilding industry expert noted that Japan's limited
experience with smaller vessels could lead to challenges if it pursued
large icebreaker contracts[. [Icebreakers are **gaining attention** due
to]{.mark} the increasing strategic and commercial [value of **Arctic
shipping routes**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which can reduce transportation
time and costs by up to 30 percent compared to traditional routes. For
example, the Northern Sea Route from Korea to Europe is about 25 percent
shorter than the Suez Canal route.

[With global warming, [year-round navigation in the Arctic may become
possible]{.mark} by]{.underline} 2030. Lee Jae-myung, a leading South
Korean political figure, has included Arctic route development in his
policy plans. The United States views Arctic expansion as a way to
counter growing China-Russia cooperation in the region, which Beijing
and Moscow recently emphasized in a joint statement.

A senior researcher from the Korea International Trade Association
indicated that while the U.S. lacks sufficient icebreaking capabilities,
[[Korea could take the lead in proposing cooperation]{.mark},
influencing negotiations, [and securing a role in Arctic infrastructure
through joint investments.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### !\-\--Japan Coop

#### Strong US/Japan prevent a range of [existential threats]{.underline}

John **Hamre 16**, President and CEO of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, Former Under Secretary of Defense, and Richard
Armitage, President of Armitage International, Former U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State, co-chairs of the U.S.-Japan Commission on the Future
of the Alliance, et al., "The U.S.-Japan Alliance to 2030: Power and
Principle", Report of the Commission on the Future of the Alliance,
2/29/2016, p. 1-5

[[The U.S.-Japan Alliance]{.mark} has helped to provide security and
prosperity to the]{.underline} Asia-Pacific region and the broader
[international community for more than half a century]{.underline}. The
Alliance enabled the United States and Japan to prevail in the Cold War,
based on the principles of deterrence, democratic values, and free
market dynamism. Today, the U.S.-Japan Alliance is as strong as it has
been at any time during its existence.

The Commission believes [the Alliance [will need **all**]{.mark} **of
[its]{.mark} current [strength]{.mark}**]{.underline} and more, [[since
the international]{.mark} security [environment]{.mark} over the next 15
years [will be]{.mark} as [**challenging** and **uncertain**]{.mark} as
any the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and Japan have
faced. [In addition to]{.mark} challenges from a rising [**China**
and]{.mark} aggrieved **[Russia]{.mark}**, the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and [Japan]{.mark} both have vital interests
in [the **Middle East**]{.mark}, which [is]{.mark} an increasingly
[unstable]{.mark} and violent region. [**Global challenges** such as
**terrorism**]{.mark}, **nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration**, [and
**climate**]{.mark} **change** will]{.underline} also [[require]{.mark}
wise policy and firm [action]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[One central characteristic]{.underline} of this emerging strategic
dynamic [will be intensified competition for power]{.underline} and
influence [across]{.underline} ideological, economic, and security
[spheres between]{.underline} liberal [democracies]{.underline} on the
one hand [and]{.underline} ambitious or aggrieved [authoritarian
regimes]{.underline} on the other. The Commission believes that [this
competition need no]{.underline}t---and in fact is unlikely to---[result
in war]{.underline}. Moreover, there are many areas in which countries
from across the ideological spectrum can and will increase mutual
cooperation, including macroeconomic coordination, countering violent
Islamic extremism, responding to climate change, and reversing nuclear
proliferation by states such as North Korea. Nevertheless, [there
remain]{.underline} fundamental [questions about international
[norms]{.mark} where **leading democracies** like the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and Japan will hold
starkly different views from more authoritarian states. These
[include]{.mark}]{.underline}: the [rights]{.underline} of citizens to
choose their own governments; the rights of minorities within nations;
[the independent]{.underline} role of the [judiciary]{.underline} and
the press; the [role of the private sector]{.underline} in the economy;
[freedom of navigation]{.underline} and flight in international sea and
air space; [and [freedom of the Internet]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[In Asia, the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[and Japan will]{.underline}]{.mark}
have to [**[shape the]{.mark} strategic [environment]{.mark}** by
[encouraging responsible]{.mark} Chinese [behavior and imposing costs
for destabilizing]{.mark} activities. [To]{.mark} that end, the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and Japan will have to
build up their own power, and use it wisely and firmly, to
**[preserve]{.mark} a [world order]{.mark}**]{.underline} that favors
both allies' shared values.

The United States and Japan have taken a number of very important
actions in the recent past to strengthen the Alliance. These include
Japan's issuance of its first national security strategy, establishment
of a National Security Council (NSC) and an associated permanent staff
organization, increases in the defense budget, and passage of security
legislation authorizing closer cooperation with the United States. The
United States has stated an intention to rebalance U.S. strategic
attention and military forces towards the Asia-Pacific region. Both
countries have concluded updated bilateral Defense Guidelines for closer
security cooperation and have reached an agreement for wider and deeper
economic cooperation through the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). These
achievements provide a solid foundation for the continued actions that
the Commission recommends in this report.

[The **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
Japan]{.underline} have unmatched strengths for the competitive
environment they will face. Together the two allies [account for 28
percent of the world's]{.underline} gross domestic product
([GDP]{.underline}) and 43 percent of the world's wealth. The economies
of [both]{.underline} countries [use and produce the highest levels of
technology, and have]{.underline} the **[r]{.underline}**esearch [and
**d**]{.underline}evelopment [systems to stay at the cutting edge
of]{.underline} discovery and [innovation]{.underline}. Their
citizenries are well educated, hardworking, and innovative. [Their armed
forces are]{.underline} among the world's [most advanced]{.underline}
and are well led and trained. [Their values]{.underline} of freedom and
democracy [have a universal appeal]{.underline} that has been repeatedly
demonstrated in all parts of the world and particularly in Asia. The
U.S.-Japan Alliance has endured for 60 years and adapted to meet an
array of new internal and external challenges.

The Commission believes that the United States and Japan must develop a
shared vision of the world both nations seek in the next 15 years.
Democracies need a vision to inspire their own citizens and to
synchronize the efforts of their governments and private organizations.
As partners in an increasingly interconnected and competitive world, the
United States and Japan must also offer a vision that will gain the
support of other countries.

The Commission proposes the following vision for the U.S.-Japan
Alliance:

The United States and Japan seek a world in 2030 in which all nations
are secure, peaceful, prosperous, and free. Working to build this world,
the United States and Japan will make national contributions that
reflect each nation's respective capabilities, legal obligations, and
traditions, but will always remain united on shared goals. The United
States and Japan are global powers with global responsibilities, but
their Alliance will continue to focus as it always has on the peace and
prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region.

Peace and Security: The United States and Japan will work together to:

 preserve peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region based on the
Mutual Security Treaty through bilateral efforts to maintain a favorable
balance of power and to deter and, if necessary, to defeat armed
aggression and attempts at coercion against their own interests, and
those of their allies and friends;

 defend and preserve the existing order based on established
international rules and norms;

 seek peaceful, negotiated resolution of issues between nations, free
from military force or coercion;

 support multilateral organizations in developing solutions to global
challenges; and

 lead and participate in international actions against state and
non-state actors that use terrorist tactics and criminal actions or
otherwise threaten the safety of their citizens and those of their
allies and friends.

Prosperity: The United States and Japan will work together to:

 support the unimpeded international flow of investment, goods, and
services to raise the prosperity of all nations, especially those at
lower levels of development;

 provide assistance both through international organizations and
directly to developing nations to improve all the aspects of economic
development and governance, private sector competence, and human
capacity, including women's empowerment;

 strengthen existing institutions such as the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund that provide development assistance and seek
to promote principles of good governance; and

 play leading roles in reducing environmental threats to the health,
and potentially the safety, of their own citizens and others around the
world.

Freedom: The United States and Japan will work together to:

 support advancement of the principles expressed in the United Nations
(UN) Universal Declaration of Human Rights;

 ensure the observance of these principles in their own countries;

 speak out and take clear public stands in the support of those
principles; and

 work over the long term, and when opportunities arise in the short
term, to advance those principles in authoritarian countries as well as
failing states.

In this report, the Commission recommends a set of coordinated policies
that will move the Alliance closer to achieving its shared vision of a
peaceful, secure, prosperous, and free world. As major economic powers
and democracies, Japan and the United States should continuously stress
two foundational pillars of the Alliance.

First, leaders and opinion makers in the United States and Japan need to
strengthen and sustain public support in both countries for active
international leadership, using the full range of foreign policy tools,
including military capabilities when necessary. In the United States,
the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have caused debates in both the
Republican and Democratic parties about the utility of force,
particularly with respect to the Middle East. In Japan, although
security legislation was enacted in 2015 to allow the exercise of the
right to collective self-defense, there is persistent and substantial
opposition to a more active security role for the military, and
misgivings about the use of military force---even for purely defensive
purposes. The Commission recognizes that military power cannot be the
sole or even the primary instrument of national security policy.
However, the potential employment of military force is often necessary
to support diplomacy, deter aggression, and keep the peace; and the
utilization of the armed forces, whether in the form of advisers,
peacekeepers, or combat units, will remain essential to deal with some
threats to peace and security in the future. The United States and Japan
must have fully-funded, modern, and highly capable military forces, and
they must be willing to employ them in support of the peaceful, secure,
prosperous, and free world that they seek. Leaders in both countries
have a responsibility to explain these realities to their publics.

Second, in order to provide the foundation for the policies outlined in
this report, both countries need to take action to support their
economies, to resume economic growth in the case of Japan, and to
sustain recovery from the recession of 2008 in the case of the United
States. Without higher rates of economic growth, the United States and
Japan will face significantly greater difficulties managing the
international challenges that are likely to emerge over the coming 15
years. Both countries have the fiscal and monetary policy tools
necessary to stimulate growth, but both must also undertake structural
changes that require continued political attention. In the case of Japan
these include: growing the workforce in the face of a falling national
birth rate; increasing productivity through more widespread adoption of
information technology; and reversing the growth of the highest debt
levels of any advanced country. In the case of the United States these
include: modernizing the country's aging physical and cyber
infrastructure; containing the costs of medical care and social security
payments for the large generation now retiring; and providing real
energy security by coupling the increased production of domestic oil and
gas with reduced dependence of the transportation sector on oil. Both
countries must also improve their educational systems to create the
digital workforce of the future.

II\. The Strategic Environment through 2030

For the first time in nearly a quarter century, [[**the world** is
witnessing]{.mark} **multiple [momentous challenges]{.mark}** to the
international order. **[China]{.mark}**'s emergence,
**[Russia]{.mark}**'s resurgence, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} the Islamic
State of Iraq and the Levant's (**[[ISIL]{.underline}]{.mark}**'s)
barbarity [[are]{.mark} forcing the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and Japan to address [simultaneous,]{.mark}
diverse [threats to]{.mark} the [international order]{.mark}. Within
Asia, increasing prosperity and economic interdependence coincide with
intensifying **friction among the major powers**. Changes in relative
power, rapid expansion in the military budgets of some states,
**[territorial disputes]{.mark}**, historical animosities, **irregular
threats**, [and **nuclear prolif**]{.mark}**eration** all [present
**serious risks**]{.mark} to regional security]{.underline}. Managing
these challenges will require an understanding of how long-term trends,
such as demographics, technology, and climate change, are likely to
affect the strategic environment. Asia is the world's most dynamic
region, so understanding current trends and potential future
discontinuities is essential if the United States and Japan are to adopt
an overall strategy that is capable of adapting effectively to rapid
shifts in the security environment.

While regional trends in the Asia-Pacific region favor continued growth
and economic integration, there are [[pockets of
uncertainty]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[could
threaten]{.underline}]{.mark} both [economic progress and political
[stability]{.mark}. These include: obstacles to China's economic
transition]{.underline} from its past export-led growth model to a
domestically driven model; [the shrinking]{.underline} working age
[population in Japan, South Korea, China, Taiwan, and Singapore;
and]{.underline} the [over-reliance of]{.underline} countries such as
[Taiwan, South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, and Australia on Chinese
momentum to drive]{.underline} their own [growth]{.underline}.

Economic growth and integration in Asia have been driven by
intra-regional trade as well as global investment flows and production
networks, underpinned by the international financial institutions
established at Bretton Woods and sustained since then with the active
support of Japan and the United States. However, as the international
economy has diversified, the original managers of global financial
governance, such as the G-7, have lost ground to more inclusive but less
effective groupings, such as the G-20. Moreover, progress on global
trade liberalization at the World Trade Organization (WTO) has stalled.
China is challenging the existing international financial institutions
with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and its new "One
Belt, One Road" initiatives. At the same time, the Trans-Pacific
Partnership (TPP), led by the United States and Japan, has the potential
to reboot international trade liberalization and governance. Passage of
TPP in Japan, the United States, and the ten other participating
countries would boost economic growth in Asia by reducing barriers,
establishing standards for ensuring protection of intellectual property
in new areas such as e-commerce, empowering China's economic reformers
as Beijing is drawn by preferential tariffs to join TPP, animating
negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership
(TTIP), and perhaps eventually helping to revitalize the pursuit of
global free trade agreements through the WTO. Governance of global trade
and finance is in flux, but the forces of liberalization and integration
are still present.

[Beyond]{.underline} these [economic concerns]{.underline} the [[dangers
of **climate**]{.underline}]{.mark} change [[and
**eco**]{.mark}**logical [degradation]{.mark}** [threaten]{.mark} the
region. [The ability]{.mark} of]{.underline} the [major
Asia]{.underline}-Pacific [economies [to cooperate in the face
of]{.mark}]{.underline} all these [**[transnational challenges]{.mark}**
will [have **important implications**]{.mark} for the future strategic
environment]{.underline}. While China and the United States are the
world's leading emitters of greenhouse gases (in that order), Japan is
the world's superpower in clean technology and energy efficiency. There
are encouraging signs of U.S. and Chinese initiatives to curb greenhouse
gas emissions as well as the recent agreement at the 2015 Paris Climate
Conference, but these promises remain aspirational and unenforceable,
requiring further efforts at bilateral, regional, and global cooperation
to reduce carbon emissions.

#### Accurate navigation charts help native peoples to hunt fish.

"While we're out on the ocean we're using sonar to map the ocean floor,"
he said.

["That data is [critical to allow us to produce modern, accurate
navigation charts]{.mark} because many parts of the Arctic, while they
are charted, the quality of those charts is not very
accurate."]{.underline}

In places, the ocean floor can be 1,500 to 2,000 metres deep.

["However, we're most interested in those areas 40 or 50 metres or
shallower where there is potential hazards to navigation and we don't
know what's there. The sonar allows us to have a complete picture of the
ocean floor."]{.underline}

[[That information is useful to]{.mark} operators of tankers and large
vessels as well as **[local people for hunting and
fishing.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

#### Current efforts solve. Countries using icebreakers consult indigenous organizations in order to preserve their land.

Ashoka **Mukpo**, 11-3-20**20**, \"Ice breakers in the Arctic: Let's
talk Inuit safety (commentary),\" Mongabay Environmental News,
https://news.mongabay.com/2020/11/ice-breakers-in-the-arctic-lets-talk-inuit-safety-commentary/

The convergence of technology, loss of one third the summer sea ice over
the past two decades, and both economic and political interest have led
the Arctic's frozen backwaters to be targeted as highways between the
Atlantic and Pacific---but also as the most efficient way to serve a
growing number of mines and oil and gas developments, Bulk
Carriers---those vessels serving the mining industry for transport of
ore---have alone increased their Arctic travel by 160 percent between
2013 and 2019!

[The Fennica and Nordica travelled with a local observer and ice pilots
guided by 30 years of experience]{.underline}. But as things get busier,
what will become of vessels entering these frozen waters with less
on-board experience of the north? Or without an understanding of Inuit
and wildlife passage across the sea ice?

These are the types of questions that were addressed a year ago by the
Proactive Vessel Management (PVM) initiative, part of Transport Canada's
Ocean Protection Plan. The initiative was designed to bring communities,
industry, and vessel operators together to proactively find solutions to
issues of concern on the waterways.

[The Ekaluktutiak Hunters and Trappers Organization (HTO) conducted a
workshop in October 2019 that brought together federal
agencies]{.underline} representing shipping and wildlife, ice breaker
operators, the mining industry, and local hunters.

Based on maps of hunter travel and research on caribou migrations,
annual ice conditions, and vessel routes, [workshop members mapped the
times and places where threats to caribou or people could occur. They
sought solutions balancing food security, traveler safety, risk to
caribou, and local and national economic development needs.]{.underline}

Through the International Maritime Organization's new Polar Code,
[operators in the Arctic must plan voyages to avoid impacts to
Indigenous Peoples,]{.underline} but can only do so through the
documentation of times, places, and mitigation measures that work.

As a result of the workshop[, a Notice to Mariners will now be published
each year that includes these details for vessel captains and operators.
Mariners can avoid the riskiest times when people and caribou are using
the frozen waterways around Cambridge Bay. They coordinate with local
representatives on what to do if transit is unavoidable.]{.underline}

For example, if ice breakers are present, [informing local communities
of their presence, reducing speed, and maintaining a single channel to
minimize damage to the ice that can take weeks to re-form can all help
avoid a catastrophic situation for caribou and people.]{.underline}

The Notice to Mariners, penned through the efforts of the Ekaluktutiak
HTO, has provided a local voice in avoiding impacts from these new
global visitors. Hopefully, as the Arctic gets busier, these
conversations can grow and find common ground solutions wherever they
arise.

and given that the UNCLOS has been dubbed to be De Facto non-binding,
should it have to be transformed into a De Jure binding agreement, the
severe and crucial differences have to be sorted out. Until then, given
the incremental nature of the acerbity, the De Facto non-binding nature
would get to be literally cast in stone.

#### 6. Dual-use tech in the Arctic causes [instability]{.underline} and [tensions]{.underline}---that [escalates]{.underline}.

From a traditional security perspective, [[the dual-use]{.mark} security
[dilemma]{.mark} [extends]{.mark} the dynamics of [policy
makers']{.mark} [fears]{.mark} [around]{.mark} an [opponent's]{.mark}
defensive or offensive [intentions]{.mark} [to include]{.mark} the fear
of the [**potentially harmful** civil]{.mark} [technologies]{.mark}.
[Policy makers are **uncertain**]{.mark} [whether the opponents have
harmful intentions]{.mark} in using the technology. But the
[potential]{.mark} [of their using]{.mark} or adapting the
[tech]{.mark}nology [for harmful purposes]{.mark}, even over the long
term, **[creates insecurity]{.mark}** and may spur policy makers to
**take measures** to address the threat.]{.underline} Similar to the
traditional security dilemma, [these measures [can]{.mark} [influence an
opponent]{.mark}'s behavior, leading it to acquire military means or
even to make military use of the dual-use technology. Furthermore, and
also like the traditional security dilemma, these [dynamics **may
spiral**]{.mark}, [aggravating]{.mark} the actors'
[security]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Even actors whose aim was to develop
technology solely for civil purposes [may find themselves **in an arms
race**]{.mark} or a costly situation]{.underline}. While militarily
arming a civilian project can be very expensive (for both sides),
failing to respond to a military project because of its civilian
characteristics can also be very costly.

From a constructivist approach, the dilemma is shaped by how the
insecurity is constructed[. Insecurity is not given, but rather is
socially produced through actors calling attention to certain issues and
mobilizing support to address them]{.underline}. Moreover, how a
technology is applied---for peaceful or military purposes---is also
socially determined. This means a technology's dual-usage is influenced
not only by its technical characteristics, but also by international
norms, by how it is conceived, and by how knowledge is mediated by
socio-scientific agents. [[Seeing]{.mark} a [tech]{.mark}nology [as
dual-use]{.mark} [allows an actor to construct it as a(n) (existential)
threat]{.mark}, even if the technology is developed for civil
purposes]{.underline}.

#### 7. The Arctic Council, NATO, and the EU [solve]{.underline} Arctic cooperation now.

translated from Polish with Google Translate, //AR!

The Arctic has been a matter of attention for the last two decades due
to new opportunities for access to natural resources and the possibility
to open marine lines of communications because of climate change.
Lately, it presents new concerns related to regional security with the
possibility of conflicts emerging as a new hotspot in this cold area.
The main risk here is a growing strategic competition in the area
between Russia and the United States. It is a complicated strategic
puzzle due to the outcome of increasing interest from so-called
non-Artic actors such as China, which recognises itself as a
'near-Arctic' state (see: Rainwater, 2013; Van der Klippe, 2014;
Guschin, 2013; Śliwa & Elak, 2018). Notably, China continuously
underlines a need to respect the rights and interests of non-Arctic
states after having been granted observer status in 2013 (Sørensen &
Klimenko, 2017, pp. 5--11). It is not only about those three powerful
actors, as the High North offers economic benefits for any nation
interested in the exploration of Arctic resources; Japan, Singapore,
South Korea, and European countries like France, Germany, Italy, the
Netherlands, Poland, and the United Kingdom are among them.
[[The]{.mark} inauguration of the [Arctic Council]{.mark}, the successor
of the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy (AEPS), [proved]{.mark}
to be a joint decision aimed toward a **[peaceful dialogue]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} all [nations interested in the Arctic]{.mark} (Nilson, 1997,
pp. 153--155). Moreover, international organisations as [NATO]{.mark}
(Horobets, 2019; Coffey & Kochis, 2018) [and the]{.mark}
[E]{.mark}uropean [U]{.mark}nion (European Commission, 2019; Stępień &
Raspotnik, 2019) have **evolved their perspectives** toward closer
interest to the region.]{.underline} Therefore, there is an essential
role for international organisations in facilitating cooperation and
avoiding competition, which is counterproductive for all the actors
interested in exploiting the Arctic. The competition cannot be excluded
with the hope that all interactions would be peaceful only (Breitenbauch
H. et al., 2019). [The governance of the Arctic, conducted through
varied international organisations, [allow]{.mark}s [for]{.mark} a
[facilitation of **constructive cooperation**]{.mark} among nations in
the exploration of the region and the preservation of the natural
environment there]{.underline} (Shea, 2019; Graczyk, 2012, p. 141). It
is of critical importance as only international institutional
cooperation can overcome the effects of global warming, as it influences
all the areas of life in the region, including indigenous populations,
the natural environment, and a variety of animal species living
specifically in the region (Graczyk & Koivurova, 2013). Another aspect
is that only through constructive and coordinated approaches can the
region be protected from the devastating consequence of possible
uncontrolled exploration of natural resources, as the Arctic is "about
cooperation, not conflict" (Käpylä & Mikkola, 2013, p. 6). The paper
aims to [present [the Arctic Council]{.mark} as a regional
intergovernmental organisation that aims to [facilitate peaceful
cooperation and **coordinated solutions**]{.mark} [toward]{.mark} the
predictable [exploration]{.mark} of the Arctic, nonetheless preserving
its [ecosystems]{.mark} [and]{.mark} natural
[environment]{.mark}.]{.underline} The question is how the Council deals
with the present multidimensional situation in the Artic. Next, the
paper investigates the potential for conflict due to developments within
the security domain. The challenge due to regional security and
sustainable development is how effectively the involved nations can
establish such cooperation and healthy competition when they often
possess competing interests. As for now, [the Arctic Council
[has]{.mark} [effectively performed its missions as a cooperation
forum]{.mark}, although there are differing agendas within members and
observes.]{.underline} Moreover, it was successful by not including
military aspects into its agenda of meetings but instead discussing
other regional domains like promising "zone of cooperation and joint
problem-solving while recognising the distinct geography, demographics,
and economics of the Far North" (Lanteigne, 2019). [The paper is based
on the positive perception of [the Council]{.mark} as an
intergovernmental organisation]{.underline}. It is based on
constructivism claiming that those are making "cooperation among states
be more likely" (Nugroho, 2008, p. 92) by "constitutive effects"
(Mitchell, 2006, p. 7) and liberal institutionalists recognising their
role in promoting cooperation, stability and causing to "govern state
behavior" (Burchill et al., 2005, p. 64). Therefore, intergovernmental
organisations "may facilitate cooperation among member states"
(Mitchell, 2006, p. 1), and this is related to the Council. The paper
focuses a more detailed study of the last decade as the development of
principles and role of new observer nations caused created an impetus in
the Council works. Although nations' roles and interests are mentioned
within the text, those do not act as the focus, as the Council in its
organisational form takes precedence. The paper is based on a
qualitative case study applying analysis of the Arctic Council official
documents, a critical interpretive synthesis that allows an
understanding of the area's essence in question and its interpretation.
It includes a consideration of member state and observer nations'
perspectives and positions toward the region and the Council. The
quantitative research is implemented only to collect quantitative data
to highlight the significant differences among the eight Arctic nations
strongly. The paper is composed of four parts. The first focuses on the
reasoning behind the establishment of the organisation as a regional
initiative with growing importance. It includes an overview of its aims,
based on the Arctic Council's essential documents and primary data from
the eight-member nations. The broader reach of the Arctic Council
through its approval of new observers and the deployment of working
groups is included in this paper presenting as well. [An interesting
feature of the organisation is the recognition and [**inclusion of
indigenous people** to the Council to utilise their knowledge and
expertise]{.mark}]{.underline}; this aspect is covered in the paper's
following part. It is followed by a generic description of the working
method of the organisation during the last decade, including highlights
of the last Ministerial Meetings, primarily through highlighting the
change in the US position toward the Arctic, which could hamper joint
decisions. The study allows drawing conclusions related to the
organisation's role as a forum for cooperation and its future.

#### 8. Turn---secrecy is [key]{.underline} for international bargaining.

Allison **Carnegie '21**, Professor of Political Science at Columbia
University, *Annual Reviews*, "Secrecy in International Relations and

//AR!

[Another reason that [leaders]{.mark} may [choose to hide their
actions]{.mark}]{.underline} from the domestic public [is [to **prevent
unwanted**]{.mark} **[escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Scholars
ranging from von Clausewitz (1956) to Schelling (1966) to George & Smoke
(1974) have recognized [the challenge of [tamp]{.mark}ing [down
escalation]{.mark} during war, particularly due to the difficulties of
providing accurate, credible information about capabilities and goals.
Recent scholarship extends these observations to theorize when [leaders
thus **choose secrecy**]{.mark} during conflict]{.underline}. For
example, Kurizaki (2007) argues that leaders choose to act in private
when the escalatory effects of public threats are greater than the
positive information effects of doing so. Kurizaki\'s paper extends the
idea of audience costs by adding audience costs on the part of the
target to the theoretical framework. It then shows that [secrecy
**[expands the range]{.mark}** [of bargaining
outcomes]{.mark}]{.underline} using a formal model and pairing it with a
historical case study.

Forty years have passed [[since the adoption of]{.mark} the
[UNCLOS]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It is necessary to review why the most
influential maritime power, namely, [the US]{.mark}, **[has not
joined]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} why more [countries]{.mark} has
[shifted]{.mark} from optimistic support [to **negative
maintenance**]{.mark}.]{.underline} After listing the legislative
features of the Convention and its positive and negative impacts on
member States, [[it is easy to find that]{.mark} the implementation of
the [UNCLOS has]{.mark}]{.underline} both advantages and
[[**disadvantages for most** member countries]{.underline}]{.mark},
especially for strong maritime powers, landlocked countries, and
countries with short coastlines, or geographically inaccessible
countries, [where the **disadvantages [outweigh]{.mark}** [the
advantages]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Faced with this harsh reality, [[maritime lawyers have]{.mark}
increasingly [abandoned]{.mark} the mainstream attitude of **[blind
optimism]{.mark}** and unconditional support for the UNCLOS; they have
instead adopted a critical attitude [and]{.mark} even [**considered
withdrawing** from the Convention]{.mark} as a possible option in the
future]{.underline}. 66 The international community should thus discuss
revising the Convention to complement some shortcomings and deficiencies
in its legislative features. This will finally bring more member States
to return to the Convention. In this process, its dispute settlement
mechanism should be fully recognized and implemented following its
legislative purposes.

#### Bipartisan support to "rethink" the Arctic Icebreaker Plan

Peter **Rybski**, 11-29-**2024**, \"Bipartisan congressional support
builds to \'rethink\' icebreaker acquisition: Commentary,\" ArcticToday,
https://www.arctictoday.com/bipartisan-congressional-support-builds-to-rethink-icebreaker-acquisition-commentary.//nishant

The House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Coast Guard
and Maritime Transportation held [[a hearing on November
14th]{.mark}]{.underline} amusingly [[titled **"Snowed In: United States
Disinvestment in the Arctic."**]{.underline}]{.mark}

I've been watching hearings about the U.S. Coast Guard's icebreakers-
held normally by both the T&I Committee and Homeland Security Committee-
for some time. They follow a pattern of sorts. The U.S. Coast Guard
leadership states that it is carrying out the nation's business, somehow
managing to get the job done with insufficient resources. The leadership
then provides the latest "official" status of its programs- a report
that normally bears no resemblance to reality1. Members of Congress will
then ask some tough questions which the U.S. Coast Guard leadership will
deflect, and there will be little follow-up.

The same problems normally surface. For example, the U.S. Coast Guard
says it needs 8-9 icebreakers but has no long-term shipbuilding plan.
[The Polar Security Cutter (PSC) program aims to build three of these
nine, but it is well over budget and **years behind
schedule**.]{.underline} Congress will chastise the Coast Guard for
failing to ask for everything that it needs, and for resisting outside
efforts to assist it. There will be lots of blame, but none of it
involves serious introspection about how the U.S. Coast Guard could have
done things differently. Repeat again in a few months.

I try to highlight a few things that are different from hearing to
hearing, finding some elements within each to classify as the good, the
bad, and the ugly. We'll start with the good news (at least good for
those of us who want the U.S. Coast Guard to get the ships that it needs
within a relevant timeframe):

This starts with [John Garamendi (D-CA)]{.underline} in his questions
for Vice Admiral (VADM) Peter Gautier, the U.S. Coast Guard Deputy
Commandant for Operations.

Mr. Garamendi is a strong advocate for strengthening the U.S. Maritime
sector. He is one of four authors of the bipartisan Congressional
Guidance for a National Maritime Strategy, along with Congressman Mile
Waltz, Senator Marco Rubio, and Senator Mark Kelly. Mr. Garamendi has
appeared with Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro, supporting SECNAV's
efforts at Maritime Statecraft.

Mr. Garamendi is a strong supporter of the Jones Act and of building
ships in the USA- so much so that he received the 2021 Maritime
Leadership Award from the Shipbuilders Council of America. I've heard
that when discussing icebreaker construction in the past, he has been
adamant that they must be built in the USA. Because of this, I found the
following exchange notable:

Mr. Garamendi: What I'm trying to do is to put on the record here that
we've got one very serious national security problem. Don't dance
around. The fact of the matter is that we do not have a presence in the
Arctic. We know where the Polar Star is2. Eventually you're not going to
be able to cannibalize other icebreakers to maintain the Polar Star3.
The bottom line here is there is a national security threat of great
significance as a result of the inability of the Coast Guard to have
adequate presence in the Arctic. Do you agree or disagree with me?

VADM Gautier: I agree

Mr. Garamendi: Very good. Now what does it take, [[8-10 icebreakers of
which three are heavy icebreakers, which will probably be able to be
delivered sometime around 2040]{.underline}]{.mark}. Is that correct?

VADM Gautier: [[It's going to take a long time to
produce]{.underline}]{.mark}...

Mr. Garamendi: A longtime, a decade. [Minimum of a decade for the first
one.]{.underline} And then who knows the next two and third one. Bottom
line here and this is really for us. We have continually underfunded the
Coast Guard icebreaker program. Continually. And unfortunately, the
Coast Guard has not sounded the red alarm and laid down "give us the
money or we cannot do it." So we're going to have to come forward here
with the money necessary to do it. The question is can it be built in
the United States in a timely manner. [[There's plenty of indication the
answer is that we ain't doing very well now. So we're going to have to
rethink this. We're going to have to rethink it.]{.underline}]{.mark} If
you need 8-10 now, next year, year after next, the only way we're going
to do it is to rethink how we're going to get those icebreakers. Made in
America? No one's been stronger on that than I have over these years.
[[But we're failing. Our industrial base has failed
us.]{.underline}]{.mark} And frankly the Coast Guard has failed us by
not sounding an alarm loud.

[[Other Committee members--- from both sides of the aisle--- made
similar comments or directly associated themselves with Mr. Garamendi's
remarks.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The Bad

Cost and Schedule:

The U.S. Coast Guard reported earlier in 2024 that [the PSC program
"would exceed cost and schedule thresholds."]{.underline} The USCG owes
an update to Congress by the end of this year, but the official update
was not available at the time of this hearing. Still, there are hints.

Cost!

In response to a question from Jeff Van Drew (R-NJ), VADM Thomas Allan,
the U.S. Coast Guard Deputy Commandant for Mission Support, said:

[Sir, w[e do not have enough (money) to complete the number
one.]{.mark}]{.underline} The question is how much more do we need and
we think by December we will understand final contract negotiations.
What that dollar amount is and what gap exists.

C[ongress has already appropriated more than \$1.7 billion for the PSC
program-- but this was for the construction of two
vessels4!]{.underline} I don't know if the appropriations can be
shifted- some of the appropriated funds surely went for long-lead items
for the second and third vessels. Still, the [Congressional Budget
Office estimates that the cost of the first vessel will be at least
\$1.9 billion, with subsequent vessels costing \$1.6 billion or more.
And that's just the construction cost- the CBO also believes that the
USCG is vastly underestimating the cost to operate the
vessels.]{.underline}

\$1.7 billion USD is more than 5X THE COST of the PC2 icebreaker Le
Commandant Charcot (2017 dollars). Charcot is an icebreaker of
comparable size and capability to the PSC's design. Don't let its
appearance fool you- Charcot, sometimes described as "NATO's most
capable icebreaker," is an icebreaker first, a luxury cruise ship
second. You can read more about Charcot here, including a direct
comparison with the proposed PSC.

Schedule:

[[There is still no information on the planned schedule for construction
of the PSCs. Even if there were, I doubt anyone would have any
confidence in tit.]{.underline}]{.mark} Sometime in the 2030s for the
first ship, 2040 before all three would be available: these dates were
used- and not challenged- during the hearing.

The Coast Guard still seems adamant that it will do something in
calendar 2024. But what? Back in July, the Commandant of the Coast Guard
told the Homeland Security Committee:

Admiral Fagan: I'm confident in the shipbuilder that we have, I'm
confident in where we are in regard to design maturity and I'm confident
that we will begin building that ship before the end of the year.

In this hearing:

VADM Allan: I'm pleased to report that we are on track to seek approval
from the Department to begin production by end of this calendar year.

So, will construction actually begin, or will the USCG merely be seeking
approval to begin construction by December 31st? This is political
nonsense. Starting production without a completed design is a bad idea,
but one the USCG seems to be pushing for in order to "do something!"

Giving conflicting testimony doesn't help, either. VADM Allan gave two
different timelines for taking the Aiviq into Coast Guard inventory. At
one point, he said by the end of this fiscal year. At another, he said
by the end of this calendar year.

The Ugly: Zero Accountability

I'm used to all of the positive spin, to the point where I don't bother
quoting it much anymore. But this time, there was one statement- from
the GAO rep! -- that caught my attention:

Mr. Larsen: How has the Coast Guard and the Navy partnership worked? The
whole idea of having the Navy be part of this was to bring the Navy's
experience into the design development but it doesn't seem to have
worked as planned.

Ms. MacLeod: GAO has reported you know the partnership between the Navy
and the Coast Guard has worked well for this procurement, these
procurements. I think that there's been a range of reasons for the
delays from contractor to Coast Guard acquisition inexperience, but the
partnership itself seems to be working well and has benefited the Coast
Guard.

UNBELIEVABLE. The GAO generally gets things right, but I can't
understand this answer.

What is the metric here, if not the ability to actually procure an
icebreaker? I'm sure the crew on the Titanic got along well, too. But
what about results? Who will be held accountable for these programs?

It's always "someone else's fault" or the fault of some force beyond our
control (COVID, lack of qualified workers, VT Halter, etc.). Yet someone
made the decision to award the contract to VT Halter. Other shipyards
churn out ships despite COVID, and Bollinger is not the only yard to
face a worker shortage. Surely some of these problems could have been
foreseen.

I remain especially critical of the original decision- to award the
contract to a shipyard/designer combination with no experience in
designing and building icebreakers.

It frustrates me that we seem to be learning nothing at all from this
mess. And if you pay taxes to the U.S. Government, it should frustrate
you too.

Other: The ICE Pact and Seattle

Even if, magically, three Polar Security Cutters fell from the sky,
their designated home port (Seattle) would not be ready to receive them.
According to VADM Allan, the USCG is currently working on the
environmental impact statement for the required improvements to its
Seattle base necessary to place three Polar Security Cutters there. At
least \$280 million is going to support those improvements in FY 24 and
FY 25.

The ICE Pact was mentioned once with no real details provided. The U.S.
Coast Guard will be participating in ICE Pact working groups, but there
are as of yet no concrete details or proposals of what type of support
the ICE Pact can provide. I will be writing more about the ICE Pact
separately.

Concluding Thoughts:

[[**The more I watch Congressional Hearings like this one, the more I
come to believe that no one really has confidence in the Polar Security
Cutter program**.]{.underline} It]{.mark} is clear that the Members and
Staffs of both the Transportation and Infrastructure and the Homeland
Security Committees are working hard to try and help the U.S. Coast
Guard to get the ships that they need. The questions are becoming more
pointed, and I hope that behind the scenes they are working together
with their colleagues on the Appropriation Committee and in the Senate.

//wenxi

[The second and [more difficult challenge]{.mark} stems from **[Russia's
perception]{.mark}** [about]{.mark} the development of new **[Western
icebreakers]{.mark}**.]{.underline} According to the United States, they
would operate on a global scale alongside polar ships of allies and
partners.20 However, [[Moscow]{.mark} strongly opposes freedom of
navigation operations (FONOPs) in their territorial waters. The Kremlin
[believes]{.mark} that [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [intends
to]{.mark} dominate the oceans and [limit its access to]{.mark} maritime
[resources and]{.mark} [sea lines]{.mark} of communication,21 This
explains why **[Russia has been taking military, political, and legal
measures]{.mark} to deter a possible FONOP, [as well as preparing to
repel]{.mark} [unauthorized foreign ships]{.mark} transiting its Arctic
waters.**]{.underline}

Consequently, in a pure security dilemma fashion, [[Russia]{.mark}
[will]{.mark} likely [see American, Canadian, and Finnish investments in
icebreakers as]{.mark} all but [**confirmation that the West is trying
to strategically encircle it in the Arctic**.]{.mark} [Moscow]{.mark}
already [believes that Western]{.mark}, or "unfriendly", [states aim
to]{.mark} militarize the region and [limit its
sovereignty]{.mark}.]{.underline}23 Additionally, it lists the expansion
of NATO's military infrastructure near Russia's borders, the increase of
naval exercises near its territory, efforts by states to weaken its
control of the Northern Sea Route, and an expanded foreign naval
presence in the Arctic Ocean as threats to its security.24

[During the ICE Pact's implementation phase, [there is little the United
States and Canada can do to alleviate Russian
anxieties.]{.mark}]{.underline} It is not in Washington's interest to
publicly declare that its new icebreakers will not be used for FONOPs in
the Russian Arctic. Otherwise, it will provide leverage for China to
push their case that American FONOPs in the South China Sea are
violations of its sovereignty.25 Simultaneously, Washington and Ottawa
cannot roll back on the agreement because they would allow Moscow to
achieve strategic naval superiority in the Arctic Ocean -- it currently
owns 46 icebreakers26 -- which it will use to project power elsewhere.

### 2AC\-\--ICE Pact Fails

#### Allies [lack nuclear icebreakers]{.underline} key to the plan\-\--instead, the US should focus on [funding their own fleet]{.underline}.

:)

Despite these growing needs, [the U.S. Coast [Guard]{.mark} currently
only **[operates two icebreakers]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the Polar Star
(already 10 years over its 30-year life expectancy) and Healy (which
suffered an electrical fire in 2020 and was only recently repaired),
[[both]{.mark} **[diesel]{.mark}-powered**]{.underline}. The only other
two U.S.-based icebreakers are privately owned or operated by the
University of Alaska.

In comparison, [**China operates two** (and is developing a third),
while **Russia's armed forces operate at least 46** --- including three
that are nuclear-powered, extending both their power and
durability]{.underline}. These numbers do not take into account those
currently under construction or planned, and both nations are investing
heavily in expanding their fleets. Russia has also re-militarized a
dozen Cold War-era arctic bases to expand its naval presence in the
region and to use as berths for its numerous active icebreakers.

[NATO [allies]{.mark} in the region, such as Norway and Canada, also
[own]{.mark} icebreaker [fleets]{.mark}. However, **[none of them are
nuclear]{.mark}-powered**]{.underline}. [**[Norway's]{.mark} fleet is
[focused on]{.mark} territorial [defense]{.mark}** against increasingly
aggressive Russian incursions while **[Canada's]{.mark} fleet is
currently comprised of smaller vessels** [focusing on]{.mark} scientific
[research]{.mark} and search and rescue efforts]{.underline}.
[[Thus]{.mark}, **the [U.S. cannot rely]{.mark} on its Northern or
European [allies for defense]{.mark} posturing** in the
Arctic]{.underline}. [This lack of a substantial U.S. fleet of
icebreakers, the absence of nuclear-powered vessels, **and [reliance on
allied icebreaker]{.mark} po[s]{.mark}turing** in the region **[is a
major flaw in]{.mark} the US national [security]{.mark} strategy** and
defensive umbrella]{.underline}, which needs to be addressed as quickly
as possible and is an important strategic investment the United States
needs to make immediately.

Currently, the two Coast Guard icebreakers fall under the jurisdiction
of the Department of Homeland Security whose budget is anemic compared
to the Department of Defense. [The Coast Guard does not have the budget
to obtain enough icebreakers to contest Russian or Chinese presence in
the Arctic --- each heavy icebreaker has an average cost of
approximately \$800 million]{.underline}. While, accumulating the same
number of icebreakers as Russia is unnecessary, moving forward all
potential solutions to securing America's North requires the purchase of
icebreakers, regardless of their status: new or used. Coast Guard
Commandant Karl Schultz has stated that "a fleet of nine U.S.-flagged
icebreakers" would be sufficient to meet our economic and security needs
in the far north.

Thankfully, Congress has already initiated expanding America's arctic
security program by authorizing the construction of six new Polar
Security Cutters (PSCs), three heavy and three medium icebreakers.
However, it is only actively funding the first four.

[The next [vital step]{.mark} to securing the North [is to]{.mark} fully
[fund and expedite]{.mark} the construction of]{.underline} these six
[[PSCs]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially given the fact that the first
PSC is currently planned to be delivered only in late 2024 if it stays
on schedule. [This is extremely important as [expanding the]{.mark}
current [fleet]{.mark}'s missions [**comes with opportunity costs**,
thus **necessitating a larger**]{.mark} **[fleet]{.mark}** to be able to
cover all possible icebreaker missions in the region]{.underline}.

[Another]{.underline} longer-term [option]{.underline}, which can also
be done [[simultaneously]{.mark} to the PSC program]{.underline}, [is to
[increase]{.mark} the available **[funding for the]{.mark} Coast
[Guard]{.mark}**, specifically focused on Arctic security, [to establish
**partnerships with**]{.mark} **private [corporations]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} design and [construct]{.mark} the United States' first
nuclear-powered icebreaking vessel]{.underline}. While more expensive,
[**[nuclear]{.mark} [icebreakers]{.mark}** come with [many
benefits]{.mark} over diesel-powered vessels, [including]{.mark} both
**[longevity]{.mark}**, **[range]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark} **power**,
including increasingly vital, **[soft power]{.mark}**]{.underline}. With
the additional range and longevity of nuclear icebreakers comes a
reduced need for the United States to build expensive and difficult to
maintain arctic bases --- the icebreakers become de facto mobile bases.
Additionally, the nuclear-powered ships can conduct longer and more
missions, cementing U.S. positioning in the region.

[[President]{.mark} **Donald [Trump]{.mark}** is [continuing his]{.mark}

[[The statement]{.underline}]{.mark}, widely dismissed by industry
experts as a gaffe, [was **[well-timed]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Just as
the Trump was committing the United States to a massive, as-yet
un-funded 40-icebreaker buildup, a raggedy set of aged American
icebreaking tugs were struggling to free a 663-foot transport ship, the
Canadian-flagged Manitoulin, trapped by wind-blown lake ice.

The endangered cargo vessel, likely rushing to beat Trump's threatened
25% tariff on Canadian goods, had just unloaded a cargo of Canadian
wheat in Buffalo and got stuck in the ice outside the frosty New York
port.

[With the [local **Coast Guard ship**]{.mark}]{.underline}---icebreaking
tug Bristol Bay (WTGB 102)---[[not up to]{.mark} the task of [breaking
thick,]{.mark} wind-blown harbor [ice on its own]{.mark}]{.underline}, a
second American icebreaking tug, the Neah Bay (WTGB 105), was called in.
[Nothing worked]{.underline}. Later, as the weather improved, a more
robust icebreaker, the Canadian Coast Guard Ship Samuel Risley, finally
managed to free the ship. A few lakes away, America's sole purpose-built
fresh water icebreaker, the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Mackinaw (WLBB 30),
cut a maintenance availability short to rumble into action.

The multi-day effort to free the Manitoulin is a big deal, reinforcing
industry-driven concerns that the Great Lakes requires better
icebreaking support to be competitive in the 21st Century. According to
the Lake Carriers' Association, inadequate icebreaking resources in the
Great Lakes, can, in a single tough season, inflict up to a billion
dollars of damage to the U.S. economy and cost about 5,000 jobs.

For a key North American economic engine like the Great Lakes, [[an

The disruptions arising from conflict around the Suez Canal have had

to Asia-Europe voyages on average, straining just-in-time supply chains.
Companies that rely on fast turnarounds---from electronics manufacturers

times and uncertain delivery schedules. [By January 2024, port call data
showed ripple effects: Weekly ship transits through the Bab al-Mandab

sharp decline in Red Sea traffic implies a significant temporary loss of
global shipping capacity, as a large share of the world's container and

**[[Egypt's revenue from the Suez Canal plunged by almost two thirds

attributing the sharp drop to regional tensions and wars in the Middle
East that have impacted traffic through the key waterway. The canal is a
major source of foreign currency for the Egyptian government, with about
10% of world trade flowing through the waterway in recent years. The
Suez Canal Authority, which runs the waterway, said the canal generated
an annual revenue of \$4 billion (€3.5bn) in 2024, down from a historic
high of \$10.3bn (€9.1bn) in 2023, according to a statement posted on
its Facebook page**.** [Canal [traffic has been]{.mark} **[significantly

concerns with economic needs. Apparently, there has been an emphasis on
building smart, environment-friendly buildings for the new capital.
Also, a few weeks ago El-Sisi inaugurated a giant wind farm along the

of eight years, but the unified Germany forged in 1871 was a resolutely
status-quo power for the rest of the century. As Stanislav Andreski
argued many years ago, many military dictatorships are peacefully
inclined because going to war would require them to arm their own
citizens, and doing so might threaten their hold on power. The [fact
that Putin is a]{.underline} **[ruthless dictator]{.underline}** who
imprisons or murders his domestic rivals and engages in other despicable
acts [tells us almost]{.underline} **[nothing]{.underline}** [about
whether he wants to]{.underline} **[conquer]{.underline}** a bunch of
Russia's **[neighbors]{.underline}** [or believes he would be able to do
so]{.underline}. And one hardly needs to be a dictator to launch an
unprovoked, illegal, and highly destructive war; I can think of some
prominent liberal democracies that have done so on several occasions.

Second, [Russia will [be in]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[no
shape]{.underline}** [to launch]{.underline} **[new
wars]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[of aggression]{.underline}** when the war
in Ukraine is finally over. U.S. [intelligence believes Russia

[troops]{.mark}]{.underline}** killed or wounded in Ukraine, [along
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} **[thousands]{.underline}** [of armored
[vehicles]{.mark} and]{.underline} **[dozens]{.underline}** [of ships

to]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[order]{.underline}**]{.mark} additional
**[troop [mobilizations]{.mark}]{.underline}** (though he may do so now
that his "reelection" is over), both [[because]{.underline}]{.mark} such

[the]{.underline}]{.mark} Russian [[econ]{.mark}omy further [and

much as the United States and its allies hoped, but the
**[long-term]{.underline}** [economic consequences]{.underline} for
Russia [[are]{.mark} still going to be]{.underline}
**[[severe]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Fighting [a]{.mark}]{.underline}

[than Putin's original decision]{.underline} to launch what he believed
would be an easy "special military operation." Isn't it just as likely
that Russia's difficulties in Ukraine will make Putin far more cautious
in the future, even if his army eventually ekes out a Pyrrhic victory?

#### [Increased presence]{.underline} in the Arctic [deters Russian militarization]{.underline} and [mitigates Arctic miscalculation]{.underline}.

3\) [Extended **deterrence through presence**]{.underline}

As recalled in the DoD Arctic strategy, [Arctic-specific integrated
[deterrence against]{.mark} existing regional [threats **must be
accomplished through**]{.mark} **more physical
[presence]{.mark}**]{.underline}.^50^ For the US, this takes the form of
joint operations with NATO and allies as well as regular exercises,
especially naval drills, across circumpolar geography.^118^

Increasing the scope and range of missions of the UK-led Joint
Expeditionary Force would also represent a valuable step forward as it
would offer the European High North a high readiness force in the
Arctic. In a NATO context, the alliance must deepen the range of
Arctic-specific drills, not least to bridge the operational learning
curve in circumpolar operations --- with the caveat of finding the
appropriate balance between sufficient presence and over-militarizing
the region.

[The idea of forward presence for extended deterrence is not Arctic
specific. What makes it "Arctic" in essence is the need to
**[uphold]{.mark} [i]{.mark}nternational [law]{.mark}** [by]{.mark}
demonstrating [continued]{.mark} access and innocent [passage
through]{.mark} potentially [contested]{.mark} bodies of
[water]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Deterrence through]{.mark} the protection
of **[freedom of navigation]{.mark}** in the Arctic]{.underline} under
the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is at the
heart of the US NSAR.^119^

[[The conce]{.mark}pt of freedom of navigation, [however]{.mark}, is
**[feed]{.mark}ing [Russia]{.mark}'s obsessive quest [for
control]{.mark}** over Arctic waters]{.underline} in the AZRF and access
beyond. Indeed, Russia persists in interpreting the NSR as a body of
"internal waters" under Article 234 of UNCLOS (also known as the Ice
Clause). Under the impact of climate change and seasonal sea-ice
reduction, the issue is that ice coverage is no longer guaranteed,
threatening the viability of the Ice Clause. The first successful
Russian passage of energy vessels through the NSR without icebreaker
escort in September 2023 is a case in point.^120^

[For the past few years, [Moscow]{.mark}'s rhetoric has been
**particularly [aggressive toward]{.mark} purported Western-led [freedom
of]{.mark} [nav]{.mark}igation** operations]{.underline} (FONOPs) ---
with the US and NATO seeking to "storm"^121^ or "snatch"^122^ the NSR
from the Kremlin's control. Naval forces and the FSB alike are also
adapting training and capabilities to counter perceived "aggressive
action from other countries."^123^ [The US NSAR and DoD strategy were
undoubtedly pored over in Russia, where [propaganda]{.mark} outlets have
been [denounc]{.mark}ing [West]{.mark}ern efforts at "deciding the
region's **future by force**"]{.underline}^124^[ or "**[inviting
confrontation]{.mark}**"]{.underline}^125^[ in the Arctic]{.underline}.

Moscow's FONOP paranoia reached a new high when the Kremlin went to
great lengths to protect its perceived Arctic interests through legal
means. Russia passed a law in December 2022 updating the NSR legal
status and rights of transit overtly restricting foreign flag navigation
through the Kara Gate, the Vilkitsky Strait by Severnaya Zemlya, and the
Sannikov Strait by the East Siberian Islands.^126^ [Closing navigation
through specific NSR **choke points** represents an attempt to preempt
potential foreign FONOPs]{.underline}.^127^ Such legal changes also
represent highly discriminatory rules that go against UNCLOS.

Regardless of actual Western intentions, [the [Kremlin]{.mark} is
[adamant]{.mark}]{.underline} (or has self-constructed the belief)
[[that]{.mark} its contested [interp]{.mark}retation of the NSR's status
under the Ice Clause [will]{.mark} soon [be tested by]{.mark} the
[US]{.mark} or NATO through the organization of a FONOP]{.underline}.
This would arguably take the form of a NATO or US naval operation trying
to sail through contested choke points along the NSR, or naval assets
breaching the December 2022 law to ascertain innocent passage and
freedom of navigation under UNCLOS.

The Arctic 7 must be careful to avoid a "FONOP vicious circle" where
tit-for-tat demonstrations of access would become routine, with the risk
of increasing incidents.^82^ [The [current situation represents]{.mark}
a unique **[risk of]{.mark} Arctic [miscalc]{.mark}ulation** that the
Arctic 7 will have to carefully monitor]{.underline}. Indeed, conducting
a US- or NATO-led FONOP in the Arctic --- let alone close to the AZRF --
carries costs. Conversely, [**[inaction]{.mark} would [vindicate]{.mark}
Russia's [belief]{.mark}** that the NSR represents an ice-covered
internal body of water]{.underline}.^128^

[[Russia]{.mark}'s regional [military posture]{.mark} is **[increasing
risks linked to]{.mark} horizontal [escalation]{.mark}** [to and
from]{.mark} the Arctic theater to regional theaters of
operation]{.underline}.^81^ If it remains unlikely that a conflict
directly erupt *in* the Arctic and *about *the Arctic, [[escalation
in]{.mark} [other theaters such as]{.mark} the **[Baltic]{.mark} Sea**
and the **North [Atlantic]{.mark}** as well as **Northeast
[Asia]{.mark}** and the **Sea of [Japan]{.mark}** could
[spillover]{.mark} over *into *and *through *both sides of the Arctic
itself]{.underline}.^82^

[**Russian [behavior and]{.mark} the risk of [miscalc]{.mark}ulation**
could [place]{.mark} regional NATO and [US]{.mark} assets [in
danger]{.mark}ous situations]{.underline}. Several [US and NATO military
assets could be theoretically [at risk from]{.mark} Russian long-range
[missile]{.mark} system[s]{.mark} and air
capabilities]{.underline}^83^ --- especially considering the extension
of Arctic runways in coastal airfields as well as the range extension of

Force Base in Alaska, the US naval air station at Keflavík in Iceland,
the Pituffik space base in Greenland, the Bodø air station in Norway,
and the US theater missile defense systems in Northeast Asia.^85^

Despite this situation, deterrence against the Kremlin's ambitions of
denial must factor in that Moscow does not have the assets or the
capabilities to conduct interdiction operations beyond the AZRF.
Regardless of Russian messaging, [[Moscow **should**]{.mark}
**[n]{.mark}o[t]{.mark} [be]{.mark} [allowed to believe]{.mark}** [it

### 2AC\-\--No Link\-\--Security Dilemma

#### The security dilemma does NOT result in war

Jeffrey **Taliaferro 01**, an American political scientist and
international relations scholarand a professor of political science at
Tufts University, 1/01, "Security Seeking under Anarchy: Defensive
Realism Revisited," International Security, Volume 25, Winter 2000/01
Issue 3,
https://www.iirjournal.com/concepts-theories/77-security-seeking-under-anarchy-defensive-realism-revisited?,
igo

[[The security dilemma is inescapable,]{.mark} [but it does not]{.mark}
always [generate intense competition]{.mark} and war.]{.underline} In
addition to the gross distribution of power in the international system,
[[other material factors]{.underline}]{.mark}, which I refer to as
\"structural modifiers,\" [may]{.underline} increase or
[**[decrease]{.mark}**]{.underline} the likelihood of
[[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}.

These include the offense-defense balance in military technology,
geographic proximity, access to raw materials, international economic
pressure, regional or dyadic military balances, and the ease with which
states can extract resources from conquered territory.

[Defensive realists assume]{.underline} that **[[structural
modifiers]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[have a greater influence
on]{.mark}]{.underline} the likelihood of [[international
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} or cooperation [than]{.underline} does
[the gross distribution of power]{.underline}. The gross distribution of
power refers to the relative share of the international system\'s
material capabilities that each state controls. Polarity, or the number
of great powers in the international system, is the most common measure
of the gross distribution of power. [[Structural
modifiers]{.mark},]{.underline} on the other hand, [[refer to the
relative]{.underline} [distribution of capabilities
that]{.underline}]{.mark} enable [[individual
states]{.underline}]{.mark} [to [carry out]{.mark}]{.underline}
particular diplomatic and military strategies. This in turn influences
the severity of the security dilemma between particular states or in
regional subsystems. Thus one may think of the structural modifiers as
mediating the effects of systemic imperatives on the behavior of states.

Consider, for example, offense-defense theory and balance-of-threat
theory. It makes little sense to speak of a systemwide offense-defense
balance in military technology. The possession of particular military
technologies and weapons systems influences the relative ease with which
a state can attack or hold territory. The objective offense-defense
balance affects the strategies of individual states and the interaction
between pairs of states; it does not change the gross distribution of
power in the international system. Similarly, balance-ofthreat theory
does not posit that states always balance against the greatest threat in
the international system. Rather they generally balance against states
that pose an immediate threat to their survival.

[Defensive realism]{.underline}, in both its neorealist and neoclassical
realist variants[, challenges notions that the]{.underline} [security
dilemma]{.underline} always [generates intense conflict]{.underline}. In
this respect, defensive realism corrects deductive flaws both in
Waltz\'s core model and in offensive realism. Waltz holds that anarchy
and the need for survival often force states to forgo mutually
beneficial cooperation. At a minimum, cooperation is difficult because
states are sensitive to how it affects their current and future relative
capabilities. Cooperation often proves to be impossible, particularly in
the security arena, because states have every incentive to maintain an
advantage over their competitors. Some offensive realists go further in
arguing that cooperation can put a state\'s survival in jeopardy. John
Mearsheimer argues that anarchy leaves little room for trust because \"a
state may be unable to recover if its trust is betrayed.\"

[[Defensive realism]{.mark} [faults these arguments for being
**incomplete.**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Cooperation is risky, but so is
competition]{.mark}. [States cannot be certain of the outcome of an arms
race]{.mark}]{.underline} or war beforehand, [[and losing]{.mark} such a
competition [can **jeopardize a state\'s
security**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Waltz\'s [balance-of-power
theory]{.mark}]{.underline} and Mearsheimer\'s offensive realism require
that states evaluate the risks of cooperation and competition, but they
[[do not explain variation in]{.mark} competitive or **[cooperative
behavior]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This has implications for]{.underline}
both [fo]{.underline}reign [po]{.underline}licy and international
outcomes.

The defensive variants of neorealism and neoclassical realism specify
the conditions under which cooperative international outcomes and less
competitive state behavior, respectively, become more likely. [According
to [offensedefense theory proponents]{.mark}]{.underline}, at the
operational and tactical level, improvements in firepower (e.g., machine
guns, infantry antitank weapons, surface-to-air missiles, and tactical
nuclear weapons) [should [favor the defense because attackers
are]{.mark}]{.underline} usually **[[more
vulnerable]{.underline}]{.mark}** and detectable [than are well-prepared
defenders]{.underline}. At the strategic level, the anticipated high
costs and risks of conquests should deter even greedy leaders.

### 1AR\-\--No Link\-\--Security Dilemma

[[Schweller challenges the existence of the security
dilemma]{.underline}]{.mark} [and [faults Waltz for]{.mark}]{.underline}
allegedly **[[relying on uncertainty,]{.underline}]{.mark}** instead of
structure[, [to explain international conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} and
balancing. He writes, \"[[Predatory]{.mark} [states **motivated by
expansion**]{.mark} and absolute gains,]{.underline} [[not
security]{.mark} and the fear of relative losses, are the prime movers
of neorealist theory. [Without]{.mark}]{.underline} some possibility of
\... \[the\] existence (of [[predatory states]{.underline}]{.mark}\],
[[the security dilemma **melts away**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline} as do
most concepts associated with contemporary realism.\"

Schweller contends that balancing would not occur in an international
system comprised entirely of security-seeking states, unless states were
uncertain of one another\'s motives. He argues that [[if all
states]{.mark} [seek security,\"the security dilemma is always apparent,
not real]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" [If aggressors]{.underline} (i.e.,
states that arm for nonsecurity reasons) do [exist]{.underline}, [then
there would be **no security dilemma**]{.underline} \"but rather an
example of a state or coalition mobilizing for the purpose of expansion
and targets of that aggression responding by acquiring arms and forming
alliances to defend themselves.\" [If]{.underline}, on the other hand,
[real aggressors do not exist, this]{.underline} [reliance on
uncertainty to explain war]{.underline} and balancing behavior
[**violates \"realism\'s** most basic tenet]{.underline} [that
conflicts]{.underline} of interest [among states are
genuine]{.underline} rather than the result of misunderstanding and
misperception.\"

#### Lack of concrete motives makes the security dilemma inevitable.

[[Schweller\']{.mark}s critique of the security dilemma misses the
mark]{.underline} in three respects. First, [he [fails to
appreciate]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the]{.mark} **[role that uncertainty
plays]{.mark}** [in]{.mark}]{.underline} both Waltz\'s
[[b]{.mark}alance-[of-p]{.mark}ower [theory]{.mark}]{.underline} and
defensive neorealism. Glaser notes that neorealism assumes [that
**[states are black boxes]{.mark}** [\"that provide no information about
internal differences]{.mark},]{.underline} [[except]{.mark}
for]{.underline} the observable [[outputs of their international policy
choices]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"61 States do not rely on the internal
characteristics of other states for

-for example, their political or economic systems---to discern their
motives. Instead, [[they must **draw inferences**]{.mark} [from]{.mark}
[observable international behavior]{.mark}]{.underline}. Nevertheless,
when a state faces a security dilemma, many policies that would improve
the state\'s security also send ambiguous information about motives.

Second[, [states face]{.mark} real [uncertainty]{.mark}]{.underline} not
only [about one another\'s present motives but also [about]{.mark} their
future motives]{.underline} and relative capabilities. [[States]{.mark}
can never be certain of]{.underline} one another\'s **[[future
intentions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[regardless of]{.underline}]{.mark}
whether they harbor \"greedy\" or [\"[security-seeking\" motives in the
present]{.mark}]{.underline}. Uncertainty about the future and
anticipated shifts in the relative distribution of power create
incentives and dişincentives for cooperative or competitive policies in
the present. [Windows of opportunity tempt declining states to
contemplate war before the power shift is complete.]{.underline} For
example, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the loss of its nuclear
monopoly and the development of thermonuclear weapons created a window
of opportunity for the United States. Preventive war arguments were
common within the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Truman administration.
Few scholars, however, would classify the United States as harboring
greedy motives.

Third, [Schweller ignores the [incidence of security-driven expansion
**in world history**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [[historical
record]{.mark} [abounds with cases of]{.mark}]{.underline} states that
pursued [**[security-driven expansion]{.mark}**]{.underline} or
preventive war. This is not to say that defensive realists deny the
existence of predatory states; in fact, they do not. Few defensive
realists would classify the expansionist behavior of Napoleonic France
and Nazi Germany as security driven.

among European states suggests that NATO may also be called upon to
guarantee the future of Arctic stability. Instead of dividing Europe,
isolating Ukraine, and expanding its influence, Moscow's invasion of
Ukraine has resulted in a closer alliance between the United States and
its Arctic NATO allies. Moreover, NATO, with the accession of Finland
and Sweden, has expanded,, and now seven out of the eight Arctic nations
are NATO members. The alliance offers an opportunity for the United
States to strengthen its position in the Arctic region while not having

Why the Next War Will Be Won or Lost in the Arctic

Climate change has accelerated strategic competition in the region among
both Arctic and non-Arctic nations, such as China. Melting sea ice from
rising global temperatures has created new military and economic
opportunities in the region. Since 1979, the Arctic has warmed four
times faster than the rest of the world, according to an August 2022
scientific study published in Nature.3) As ice rapidly melts in the
Arctic, increased access to critical rare earth elements, such as
platinum, copper, lithium, cobalt, and nickel emerge. Moreover, melting
ice is opening more easily traversed Arctic waters, which has led to a
surge of both military and commercial ship activity in the region. These
two developments have increased the potential for conflict in the
Arctic.

Any nation that can effectively mine, process, and refine the materials
will have a strategic advantage. These minerals are required for
developing technologies ranging from renewable energy systems to
electronics used for national defense. According to the World Bank, the
demand to produce minerals, many of which are found in the Arctic, could
increase by nearly 500 percent by 2050 to meet the growing demand for
clean energy technologies.4) China already dominates the global supply
chain for critical materials. The United States depends on these
materials for its economic competitiveness and national defense.5)

[As ice melts, new routes are emerging]{.underline} that are more
navigable. This has resulted in more ship activity in the region. For
instance, the Arctic Council Working Group on the Protection of the
Arctic Marine Environment reports that there has been a 37 percent
increase in ship numbers and distance sailed in the Arctic over the past
ten years.6) While much of this activity is commercial, [[Russia]{.mark}
[and China have]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[taken advantage of the new
sea routes to **project their naval power**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[They
have carried]{.underline}]{.mark} [[out]{.underline}]{.mark} numerous
[[regional]{.mark} deployments and patrols]{.underline}, [demonstrating
their ability to execute [military
op]{.mark}]{.underline}eration[[s]{.underline}]{.mark} in the austere
Arctic climate.7) The expanded presence of Russian and Chinese ships in
the region poses a growing threat to NATO member states. In October
2023, Finnish investigators suspected the Chinese vessel NewNew Polar
Bear of dragging its anchor over the seabed and severing three Baltic
telecom cables and one pipeline. While the international community has
not assigned blame wholly to China, China later admitted to accidentally
destroying an important gas pipeline connecting Finland and Estonia in
the Baltic Sea in 2024. These examples suggest that incidents of this
nature could become more likely as military activity increases in the
region.8)

Competition in the Arctic Is Heating Up: Russian and Chinese Ambitions

The [[**growing partnership** between Russia and China]{.underline}
[provides]{.underline}]{.mark} early [[warning signs]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} [the region could]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[become]{.mark} [a site of]{.mark}]{.underline} future
[[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}. In 2021 Russia and China renewed their
20-year-old Sino-Russian Treaty of Good Neighborliness and Friendly
Cooperation, a move described as "an act of friendship against
America."9) Moreover, both Russia and China have deep historic and
economic ties to the Arctic. NATO's expansion to include Finland and
Sweden have increased tensions in the region, while both Russia and
China have expressed their disapproval of NATO's increasing presence in
the Arctic.10) However, despite feeling antagonized by NATO's actions,
Moscow and Beijing may not have the economic and military capacities to
reshape the current international rules-based order in the Arctic in the
near term.

impact on the Permanent Participants (representing Arctic indigenous
peoples) has been largely overlooked.

The challenges faced by the Arctic Council (the premier forum for
regional cooperation) over the past two years are emblematic of the
current state of circumpolar affairs. [Within weeks of
Russia's]{.underline} full-scale [invasion of Ukraine in
2022]{.underline}, [seven]{.underline} of the eight [[member
states]{.underline}]{.mark} (Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Finland, Norway,
Sweden and the US) jointly [**'[paused' their
involvement]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the Council and its affiliated
bodies. Around a third of the Council's 130 projects were reportedly put
on hold, with new projects blocked and existing projects unable to be
renewed.

Gradually, the 'Arctic 7' have found ways to resume activities with
minimal participation from Russia. The handover of the chairship from
Russia to Norway in 2023 proceeded smoothly. In February 2024, Norway
announced that the Council's Working Groups, where the organisation's
main work takes place, would be resumed with the participation of all
states, including Russia -- but only in a virtual format.

Yet despite these steps to restore critical functions, [there
is]{.underline} still good [reason to be concerned by]{.underline} the
[Arctic]{.underline} Council['s future prospects.]{.underline} Even as
plans for the Working Groups to meet virtually were being drawn up,
[[Moscow announced that it would]{.mark} [**suspend its annual
payments** to the Arctic Council]{.mark}]{.underline} until the
organisation resumes its work in full. Since 2022, Russia has restricted
access to scientific data that is crucial to monitoring climate change,
and especially to assessing the potential impact of carbon dioxide and
methane 'bombs' being released by Russia's melting permafrost as part of
a feedback loop. Such a situation will negatively impact climate change
prediction models at large.

[Signs of [increasing collaboration in the Arctic between
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} other members of

#### Cooperation between Russia and US is impossible- prefer our evidence from the State Department

[[Russia\'s unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine]{.mark} has
[upended decades of cooperation]{.mark} and collaboration]{.underline}.
Among the eight Arctic states, Russia has the most territory and
population north of the Arctic Circle. It is an important Arctic
nation[. But [Moscow\'s decision to invade its neighbor,]{.mark} an
independent and sovereign state, [makes cooperation **virtually
impossible**]{.mark} for \[the\] foreseeable future]{.underline},"
outlined Derek Chollet, Counselor at the US State Department. 

He outlined how the significantly more challenging international
situation -- vis-à-vis Russia but also China -- impacts and is
interconnected with the Arctic.

However, **[[this trend of more complicated cooperation in the Arctic
precedes last year's invasion]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Chollet
elaborated.

"Even before launching the largest European conflict since the Second
World War, [[Moscow began an aggressive program of remilitarization of
the Arctic]{.mark}. It began building or modernizing bases, expanding
its icebreaker fleet and developing and testing dangerous naval weapon
systems. **[This ran counter to maintaining the High North as a region
of low tension]{.mark}**."]{.underline}

There is [[no sign]{.underline}]{.mark} yet (publicly at least) that
[[either side is seeking]{.underline}]{.mark} to change the 'facts on
the ground' regarding [critical international
[agreement]{.mark}s]{.underline}, or even press claims in areas of
disagreement -- for instance, over how to interpret the Svalbard Treaty
on the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) as it applies to the
Northeast Passage (including the Northern Sea Route, or NSR) and the
delimitation of extended continental shelves.

Nevertheless, [[Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} remains [[determined to
**control 'its' Arctic**]{.mark} and the NSR]{.underline}. Over the past
few years, [successive [**waves of regulations**
have]{.mark}]{.underline} increasingly [[restricted passage through the
NSR,]{.mark} [placing it under Moscow's]{.mark} [tight
control]{.mark}]{.underline}. If, even as the effects of climate change
are felt, Russia maintains its dubious interpretation of the status of
the NSR, or if the [Kremlin seeks to further **restrict
passage**]{.underline} along the route (especially for foreign military
vessels), there could be more serious consideration of a US- or NATO-led
Freedom of Navigation operation, even if it increases the risk of an
armed clash.

These issues are all the more critical in the context of the renewed US
interest in Arctic affairs as part of the 2022 National Strategy for the
Arctic Region (NSAR) and its 2023 Implementation Plan. Indeed, the NSAR
is quite clear regarding protecting freedom of navigation across the
Arctic region in accordance with UNCLOS.

For now, the most likely scenario is that [[we will continue to
see]{.underline} [a]{.underline}]{.mark} balancing [and
[counterbalancing of NATO and]{.mark} [Russian
forces]{.mark}]{.underline} in the High North as both sides adjust to
the realities of Swedish and Finnish membership of NATO. The danger is
that this could increase the risk of a miscalculation provoked by an
accident escalating into something worse. More presence and platforms in
a changing Arctic will undoubtedly bring about more incidents, including
environmental catastrophes and human-made disasters, with indigenous
peoples and other local communities bearing the brunt of the impact.

Beyond that, we anticipate that [the Arctic will remain in
limbo]{.underline} until one side or the other makes a move to either
restore or abandon the Arctic Council, or attempts to press a claim that
undermines the commitment that all the Arctic states made in Ilulissat
in 2008 (and again in 2018) to resolve their disputes in accordance with
international law. The wider risk is that in the absence of a
circumpolar approach, creeping alternatives will harden the dividing
lines between Russia and the West.

[[Neither side currently looks ready]{.underline}]{.mark} to blink
first. [[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, meanwhile, [[may seek to **exploit
the fragmentation** of]{.mark} [Arctic governance]{.mark}]{.underline}
to push for its own 'free for all' approach. All the while, human
insecurity and climate breakdown in the Arctic look set to worsen.

#### Russia doesn't want cooperation, Putin's refusal to have a ceasefire proves

Peter **Dickinson 25,** editor at Ukraine Alert, Chief Editor of
Business Ukraine Magazine and writer for the Arctic Council, 4/8/25,
"Russia's endless ceasefire excuses are proof that Putin does not want
peace",
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/russias-endless-ceasefire-excuses-are-proof-that-putin-does-not-want-peace/
//maeve

Almost [[one month since]{.underline} [Ukraine agreed
to]{.underline}]{.mark} a US-led unconditional [[ceasefire, Russia
has]{.underline}]{.mark} this week [[come up with]{.underline}]{.mark}
yet [[another excuse]{.mark} to avoid following suit]{.underline}.
Speaking in Moscow on April 7, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry
Peskov claimed that while Russian President Vladimir Putin backs calls
for a ceasefire, questions remain over the Ukrainian government's
alleged inability to control "a number of extremist and nationalist
units that simply do not obey Kyiv."

[[This latest excuse]{.underline}]{.mark} is a variation of the tired
old trope about "Ukrainian Nazis" that has been [[used
exhaustively]{.underline}]{.mark} by the Kremlin since 2014 [[to
legitimize Russia's escalating aggression]{.underline}]{.mark} against
Ukraine. For more than a decade, Putin's propagandists have been
depicting Ukraine as a hotbed of far-right extremism as part of a
disinformation campaign designed to dehumanize ordinary Ukrainians and
prepare the ground for the wholesale erasure of Ukrainian national
identity. It therefore comes as no surprise that Moscow is now citing
this phantom fascist threat in order to rebuff calls for a ceasefire.

In reality, Ukrainian public support for far-right political parties is
among the lowest in Europe. After years of failure at the ballot box,
Ukraine's nationalist parties formed a coalition ahead of the country's
last prewar parliamentary elections in 2019, but could only collectively
muster 2.16 percent of the vote. That same year, Ukrainians also elected
Russian-speaking Jewish comedian Volodymyr Zelenskyy as the country's
president. Zelenskyy's Jewish heritage has helped highlight the
absurdity of Russia's "Nazi" narrative, forcing [[Kremlin
officials]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[engage in increasingly ridiculous
mental gymnastics]{.underline}]{.mark}. Most notoriously, during a 2022
interview with Italian television, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei
Lavrov sought to defend Moscow's baseless claims by declaring that Adolf
Hitler "also had Jewish blood."

As the world watches the Russian invasion of Ukraine unfold,
UkraineAlert delivers the best Atlantic Council expert insight and
analysis on Ukraine twice a week directly to your inbox.

In addition to invoking imaginary Ukrainian Nazis, [[the Kremlin has
also sought to stall negotiations over a possible
ceasefire]{.underline}]{.mark} by questioning the legitimacy of the
Ukrainian government. Ukraine was scheduled to hold presidential and
parliamentary elections in 2024, but the Ukrainian Constitution
stipulates that elections cannot take place during martial law. Despite
this constitutional barrier and numerous logistical obstacles to wartime
elections in Ukraine, officials in Moscow have repeatedly called for a
new national ballot while arguing that President Zelenskyy lacks the
authority to conclude a peace deal.

Most recently, Putin went one step further by suggesting that Ukraine
should be placed under some kind of external administration, with United
Nations officials overseeing elections. This obvious attempt to derail
peace talks proved too much even for US President Donald Trump, who
reportedly responded by stating that he was "pissed off" with Putin.
Trump then threatened to impose secondary tariffs on Russian oil exports
if [[the Kremlin dictator refuses to make a deal
ending]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[war]{.mark}]{.underline} in Ukraine.

[[Putin's inflexible negotiating position]{.underline}]{.mark} further
[[underlines his intention to continue]{.underline}]{.mark} the invasion
of Ukraine. Kyiv has made a number of major concessions in recent
months, including expressing its readiness to accept the temporary
occupation of Ukrainian regions currently under Kremlin control. Rather
than offering compromises of his own[[, Putin has insisted
on]{.underline}]{.mark} the surrender of additional Ukrainian land that
the invading Russian army has so far been unable to seize. He also
demands [[an end to all foreign aid]{.underline}]{.mark} and the
dramatic reduction of the Ukrainian army to a mere skeleton force. This
would leave Ukraine partitioned, isolated, disarmed, and defenseless
against further Russian aggression. No Ukrainian government could expect
to remain in power for long if they accepted Putin's maximalist terms.
Indeed, it is unlikely that Ukraine itself would survive such a suicidal
settlement.

### 2AC\-\--Non-Unique\-\--Tipping Points

#### Non Unique\-\--Arctic warming is past the tipping point

Robert **Hunziker 22**, environmental journalist for counterpunch,
3/27/22, "Climate Change: We're Past the Tipping Point of No Return",
https://www.citywatchla.com/climate/24170-climate-change-we-re-past-the-tipping-point-of-no-return//WF

During the interview [[a **tipping point** is
discussed]{.underline}]{.mark} in the context of reduction of Arctic
summer sea ice to 3/4ths of its volume, as the Arctic's highly
reflective ice melts into a dark background of sea water that easily
absorbs almost all of the incoming solar radiation, in turn, absorbing
warmth that would otherwise be 80%-90% reflected back to outer space via
the long-standing albedo effect of ice. In turn, [[a]{.mark} **warming
[Arctic]{.mark}** [causes]{.mark} excessive [warmth to]{.mark} hit
[Greenland, which]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to Dr. Jason Box
(professor in glaciology at the Geological Survey of Denmark and
Greenland) [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} already ["**[past]{.mark}** the
point of [**system stability**," meaning **past**]{.mark} **a tipping
[point]{.mark}** [of **no return**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Recently Box
publicly warned of abrupt climate change forthcoming. Meanwhile,
Greenland's melt releases cold water into the Atlantic, in turn, slowing
down the Atlantic Gulf Stream, and, as follows, weakens Atlantic
circulation that, in turn, negatively impacts precipitation in the
eastern Amazon.

Like a series of dominoes falling one onto another, one initial event
(a) loss of Arctic sea ice brings (b) warmer Arctic waters (c) cascading
into more Greenland melt-off, causing (d) slower Atlantic circulation,
triggering (e) loss of precipitation for the eastern Amazon. The net
result because of one non-linear event, i.e., loss of Artic sea ice
triggers four additional major events. Ipso facto, those five events
reinforce each other for who knows how long?

According to Spratt: "So, we see that [a [change in one system]{.mark},
i.e., Arctic ice volume echoes or [has **domino effects**]{.mark}
through other systems," [which **triggers** a tipping]{.mark}
[point]{.mark} that, in fact, is [already at a **seminal

### 1AR\-\--Non-Unique\-\--Inev

#### Thumped -- melting inevitable

Rob **Hutchins**, 5-12-20**24**, \"Arctic Ocean could see its first ice
free day by 2027,\" Oceanographic,
https://oceanographicmagazine.com/news/arctic-ocean-could-see-its-first-ice-free-day-by-2027///nishant

[[The Arctic Ocean could have its first ice-free day as soon as
2027,]{.mark} marking an "ominous milestone for the
planet",]{.underline} according to an alarming new report [pulled
together by a team of international researchers]{.underline} warning
over the crucial need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions drastically.

As the climate warms from increasing greenhouse gas emissions, sea ice
in the Arctic has been melting at an "unprecedented speed" of more than
12% each decade. [[At such a rate, it is inevitable that the Arctic
Ocean will be ice-free within the next 20 years, scientists
warn.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The study -- led by [[researchers]{.mark} from the University of
Colorado Boulder -- [warns that regardless of how much we alter our
greenhouse gas emissions now, this "ominous milestone for the planet"
will almost certainly be reached within nine to 20 years after
2023.]{.mark}]{.underline} In fact, [the study's lead
[authors]{.mark}]{.underline}, Alexandra Jahn (a climatologist at the
University of Colorado Boulder) and Céline Heuzé from the University of
Gothenburg in Sweden [[suggest that the earliest ice-free day in the
Arctic Ocean could occur within three years.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### 2AC\-\--No Link

#### Icebreakers empirically eco-friendly.

Catarina **Stewen**, 02-20**21**, \"Climate change doesn't erase the
need for Finnish icebreaker innovations,\" thisisFINLAND,
https://finland.fi/business-innovation/climate-change-doesnt-erase-the-need-for-finnish-icebreaker-innovations///nishant

Then we need to understand how an icebreaker breaks ice. [[Unlike the
way it might appear, an icebreaker does not really break the
ice]{.underline}, [but bends it downwards. Bending the ice requires
**much less energy** than crushing it.]{.underline}]{.mark} This is the
reason the icebreaking ship's strong steel hull is not vertical --
instead it is flat and almost horizontal. This type of shape is natural
for the stern of the ship (that's the back of the ship, to us
non-sailors). Therefore, if the ships sails astern (in a backwards
direction), it can break ice with less energy. The problem is that a
vessel cannot be steered while sailing astern, unless the propeller is
replaced by an azimuthing thruster, which can be turned 180 degrees when
the ship sails astern

Combining these two things resulted in a DAS-type vessel that can sail
in two directions, ahead and astern. Sailing astern can be used for
icebreaking, and normal ahead mode for sailing in open water. Astern
mode is so efficient that these ships can break almost any ice, due to
the flat shape and even propellers crushing the rest of the ice blocks.

Aker Arctic's DAS-type vessels with high ice classifications are ships
that brave the most demanding ice conditions. In addition to
icebreakers, this can mean ships designed to operate without icebreaker
escorts. Such innovations make commercial transport viable in the
Arctic. At the same time, DAS also reduced, by half, the vessel power
required, with a corresponding decrease in emissions.

LNG and hybrid tech

[[Using liquefied natural gas (LNG) instead of heavy fuel oil has
additionally **lowered pollution**.]{.mark} LNG produces smaller amounts
of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions, and no sulphur
oxide.]{.underline} [[LNG also **does not emit** black carbon,]{.mark}
soot particles that are especially damaging to the Arctic and contribute
to climate change.]{.underline}

Aker Arctic has designed large carriers for transporting LNG from Arctic
locations. The LNG is stored onboard in large tanks that keep the gas at
a temperature of minus 163 degrees Celsius (that's minus 261 degrees
Fahrenheit for anyone who's keeping track). LNG is also playing an
increasingly significant role as fuel for ships. The first icebreaker
ever to use LNG is the Finnish icebreaker Polaris, designed by Aker
Arctic.

The next step in reducing emissions is hybrid technology and alternative
fuels.

"Icebreaking requires high power, which cannot be achieved with
batteries," says Suojanen. "However, they can be used to balance rapid
power variations, improving fuel efficiency. Other fuels, such as
methanol, are also being explored."

Fossil-free future

[Recent examples of Aker Arctic's steady flow of innovations [include
the polar exploration vessel and luxury cruise ship Le Commandant
Charcot, **an LNG-electric hybrid**,]{.mark} for the French company
Ponant; a next-generation [Baltic assistance icebreaker with unrivalled
**energy efficiency** and the first methanol-ready icebreaker for
Sweden;]{.mark} and a year-round service operation vessel (SOV) for
offshore wind farms in seasonally freezing seas]{.underline}

Aker Arctic has also recently completed the hull form and contributed to
the concept design for Canada's sixteen new Multi-Purpose Vessels and is
part of the design team for the upcoming Canadian Polar Icebreaker,
[which will be one of the **most capable** icebreakers in the world,
operating in the Arctic's ice-covered waters.]{.underline}

The company conducts comparisons on the suitability and sustainability
of different fuels for use in various icebreaking ships or icebreakers.
[[The comparison is based on the operating area and its environmental
conditions, the type of ship, and the ship's operating profile]{.mark}.
Naturally, the availability of different fuels in the ship's operating
area influences the choice.]{.underline}

[As a result of their research on renewable fuel options for the Baltic
assistance icebreaker, methanol was chosen as the most favourable
alternative from a technological point of view, providing the longest
autonomy time which is crucial in icebreaking activities.]{.underline}

"Ice-strengthened vessels and icebreakers will still be needed in the
future," says Suojanen. "A vessel designed and built for its task and
the conditions it will face is the best for both safety and the
environment."

### 1AR\-\--No Link\-\--Ice Loss

#### No Link\-\--Icebreakers effect on ice loss is miniscule

Katherine **Leitzell 12**, journalist for Anchorage Daily News, 4/28/12,
"Do Icebreakers Contribute to Climate Change?",
https://www.adn.com/arctic/article/do-icebreakers-contribute-climate-change/2012/04/28//WF

Meier decided to crunch some numbers and find out. While his
**[[numbers]{.underline}]{.mark}** are an estimate, he said, they
[[provide]{.mark} a helpful [comparison of]{.mark} just [how]{.mark}
much [icebreakers]{.mark} might [contribute to]{.mark} summer [ice
loss]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Meier said, \"In late June, when the sun\'s energy is strongest, the
total [**sea ice extent** is around **10 million** square
kilometers]{.underline} or 3.9 million square miles. [An
[icebreaker]{.mark}]{.underline} cruising through the ice for 1,000
kilometers (620 miles) and leaving an ice-free wake of 10 meters (33
feet) [[would open]{.mark} an area of water **[10]{.mark} square**
[kilometers]{.mark}]{.underline} (3.9 square miles) [over the **entire
cruise**]{.underline}.

In contrast, [[the]{.mark} Arctic sea [ice]{.mark} cover [decreases
by]{.mark} an average of over [9 million]{.mark} square
kilometers]{.underline} or 3.5 million square miles [each
year]{.underline} during its melt season---[an area larger than the
contiguous United States.]{.underline} In total, researchers estimate
that the number of icebreakers traversing the Arctic at any given time
is usually less than three. So, Meier said, [\"[The]{.mark} actual
**[contribution is miniscule]{.mark}**---only **[one]{.mark}** part
[**in a million** of the total]{.mark} ice cover.\"]{.underline}

### 2AC\-\--Link Turn\-\--Research

#### Turn\-\--Icebreakers are key to conduct research that mitigates climate change.

Abbie **Tingstad et al 20**, journalist for RAND, 12/8/20, "The U.S.
Coast Guard is Building an Icebreaker Fleeet",
https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PEA702-1.html

The diversity of potential situations in which icebreakers might be
employed must also continue to be considered in acquisition planning. As
of 2020, the United States' polar [[icebreakers
conduct]{.underline}]{.mark} primarily two missions. The first is
[**scientific [research]{.mark}**, performed together [with the
**N**]{.mark}ational **[S]{.mark}**cience **[F]{.mark}**oundation and
other partners:]{.underline} [[Understanding polar environments is
important in]{.mark} characterizing **global [weather]{.mark}** [and
**oceanographic** patterns]{.mark},]{.underline} as well as how these
are changing over time. The second mission is [[resupply]{.mark},
primarily [for **research stations**]{.mark}]{.underline} in Antarctica
but also [for remote Alaskan communities]{.underline}. For example,
during the winter of 2011--2012, the medium icebreaker Healy enabled a
tanker to deliver critical fuel supplies to the city of Nome, Alaska. In
addition, these cutters have enabled presence and readiness for possible
polar contingencies, such as search-and-rescue events; the Healy was
present for parts of the Crystal Serenity's historic transit of a large
cruise ship from Seward, Alaska, to New York through the Northwest
Passage with 1,700 passengers and crew members aboard (Rosen, 2016).

All signs point to an increased demand for the Coast Guard's missions in
the coming decades and potentially expanding roles for these cutters.
[[Scientists need]{.mark} to conduct [research on **polar
climate**]{.mark} conditions [to]{.mark} **increase** their
[understand]{.mark}ing of **[regional influence]{.mark}** on the rest of
the world]{.underline}. Foreign and domestic commercial interests will
continue to explore the polar regions in search of shorter transit times
for vessels; extraction of resources, such as minerals, oil, and fish;
and tourism. Some of this monitoring can be done from the air or via
satellite. For the next several decades, however, [human beings
[will]{.mark} still [need to]{.mark} **actively [collect]{.mark}** and
evaluate **[samples]{.mark}** from the polar regions]{.underline}. In
addition, demand for resupply and even rescue may grow as the poles
become more accessible thanks to reduced summer ice cover, contributing
to increased human activity in the region. As this occurs, U.S. policy
requires the Coast Guard to maintain a capability to oversee national
interests by executing its statutory missions.

#### Research solves biodiversity.

Despite more than a century of scientific observation, [[the]{.mark}
Central [Arctic]{.mark} Ocean [remains]{.mark}]{.underline} one of the
**[[least studied]{.underline}]{.mark}** bodies of [water]{.underline}
in the world. Hostile [[weather]{.underline}]{.mark}, multiyear [sea
[ice]{.mark}]{.underline}, total [[darkness]{.underline}]{.mark} part of
the year, [[and remoteness hinder researchers]{.underline}]{.mark}
endeavoring to better understand this region, its unique biodiversity,
and dramatic shifts underway.

What we do know is this: The Arctic is changing quickly as the poles
warm. Sea ice cover, which has endured for millennia, is quickly
disappearing, thinning and shrinking as the biome heats up at twice the
rate of the rest of the world. In the absence of ice, southern species
are moving north, sometimes making refugees and relics of long-term
residents.

We also know [[we can **no longer afford** for the]{.mark} Central
[Arctic]{.mark} Ocean [to be a **mystery**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the
region heats up, the web of life that once tied together cold-loving
species living in and near its enigmatic waters has begun to unravel,
and may soon verge on collapse as the old guard fails to compete with,
and gives way to, a new regime with largely unforeseeable consequences.

and the more habitat changes. Image by Patrick Kelley / US Coast Guard.

[All of Earth's natural systems hang in a delicate balance.]{.underline}
Add too much of one thing --- carbon dioxide, aerosols, nitrogen, Homo
sapiens --- or subtract too much of another --- forests, freshwater,
keystone species --- and suddenly biodiversity and biomes can go askew.
Put more eloquently, scientists theorize that there are nine planetary
boundaries beyond which limits we may not go and must abide by. If we do
exceed these boundaries, our societies and species --- our safe
operating spaces for humanity --- are in jeopardy.

So far, we've already surged into the danger zone for four of the nine
planetary boundaries: climate change, biodiversity, land-system change,
and biogeochemical flows (disruption of the nitrogen and phosphorous
cycles). This is particularly bad news for Arctic Ocean biodiversity,
which has felt some of the ramifications of these life support system
imbalances and shocks far sooner than anywhere else on Earth. Like
dominoes falling into one another, serious changes are impacting life at
the top of the world.

One of the most sweeping polar biodiversity changes involves Arctic
microbes: As warming sea thin ice cover, phytoplankton --- free-floating
microscopic marine algae --- are booming.

Phytoplankton form the basis of the marine food web and they're
dependent on sunlight to grow. In the Arctic Ocean, blooms often occur
over the continental shelves after ice melt in open water when the
microalgae is bathed in 24-7 sunlight in summer. Indeed, much of the
biological production in the Arctic takes place in these areas due to
the formation and melt of annual sea ice, which regulates the
biogeochemical cycling of organic carbon and other elements in the water
column.

But in 2011, scientists discovered a massive and utterly unexpected
phytoplankton bloom underneath thinned Arctic sea ice in the Chukchi Sea
between Alaska and Russia, one of five peripheral seas of the Arctic
Ocean. Biologists had previously believed this almost impossible; sea
ice and snow reflect incoming solar radiation, starving plant-life of
energy.

But the thinning of sea ice had allowed light to penetrate the dark
waters of the Arctic Ocean, allowing phytoplankton to photosynthesize
and flourish.

"Climate change has made the Arctic more productive," says Kevin Arrigo,
a biologist at Stanford University who led the study published in
Science. "Because there's so much first-year ice in the Arctic, and it's
thin and flat, light has an easier time reaching the water below."

abundance --- because these microorganisms are at the bottom of the food
chain --- has the potential to impact species farther up the chain
including fish, birds and even large mammals. Image by Allan Hopkins

Arctic phytoplankton blooms now last longer. And they're more abundant
in terms of how much biomass is produced. Though scientists found
evidence of such blooms occurring in the past if the conditions were
exactly right, these under-ice blooms are happening more often as the
"Arctic is more amenable to blooms than it used to be."

Every Arctic species relies on energy from phytoplankton. Krill and
copepods eat the plankton, which in turn are eaten by fish, which are
eaten by seals, which are eaten by polar bears. "Everything starts with
phytoplankton," says Arrigo.

At first glance, the microscopic blooms would appear to be good news.
More productive northern waters should help Arctic species. But that's
not strictly the case, Arrigo says. "There's a potential dark side." As
climate change destabilizes phytoplankton at the base of the food chain,
"the Arctic is becoming less like the Arctic and more like the North
Pacific."

Increasingly, southerly animals are moving in to take advantage of the
new productivity.

be challenged. Image courtesy of earth.com.

One fish, two fish, red fish, new fish

Warming seas have triggered a poleward shift in fish species in the
Arctic, reshuffling the food web as we know it.

The peripheral Barents Sea, north of Norway, is one of the
better-studied Arctic marine regions where this species shift is
occurring. When scientists surveyed 52 fish species there in a 2017 PNAS
study, they found that Arctic bottom-dwelling species that feast on
shellfish and invertebrates on the seafloor were gradually being
replaced by incoming boreal fish species --- primarily generalist
species, such as cod and haddock --- that eat smaller Arctic fish and
outcompete native species, potentially creating an imbalance in the food
system. These boreal fish have been documented moving into the North
American Arctic and Eurasian Arctic.

"As the North Atlantic is warming, the cod is expanding northward," says
Maria Fossheim of the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research. "There's
now more space for it to occupy in the Barents Sea and there's more
food. In the past, subzero temperatures and sea ice stymied their Arctic
advance."

Much of this climate change-driven shift in polar fish species is
occurring near the shallow continental shelf seas bordering the Central
Arctic Ocean, areas traditionally neglected by the world's large fishing
fleets because commercially desirable fish had been sparse there. But
inevitably, analysts say, this climate change-driven move by targeted
species --- including cod, haddock and others --- will lure fleets
northward, putting new environmental pressures on high latitude waters.

the Arctic Ocean and likely to lure fishing fleets there. Image by

Also, as southerly fish move in, native Arctic fish lose out. The polar
cod, for example, is an ice-associated species; it feeds on zooplankton
on the underside of sea ice. With less ice floating atop the ocean along
with warmer temperatures, polar cod populations are expected to decline
17% by the end of this century.

These changes in the food chain could "alter the structure, composition
and functions of future Arctic communities," reads a recent study from
researchers at Hokkaido University. By century's end, such changes are
likely to be felt in every node of the Arctic food chain, though
predicting precisely what the radically altered polar marine biome will
look like is impossible.

"What we're seeing in this ecosystem is that mammals, fish, seabirds,
and plankton are all moving," says Fossheim. "The whole regime is
shifting. But you can't move everything north. At some point, some
species won't be able to live there." Smaller fish adapted to living at
300 meters depth, for example, can't very well move to 3,000 meter
depths in the Central Arctic Basin. Soon, Fossheim says, these changes
will impel biodiversity loss.

Birds of a feather

For scientists, seabirds are the canary in the Arctic Ocean's coal mine.
"They're very useful indicator species," says Grant Gilchrist, a
research scientist at Environment and Climate Change Canada.

Birds are long-lived; they can be marked with a band; scientists can
take blood samples; and they can be tracked year to year --- sometimes
by satellite. All these tracking and diagnostic tools are useful in the
remote Arctic environment. Birds "forage and sample in places where it's
hard for humans to sample," Gilchrist says.

Tracking the health of seabirds and their populations, scientists can
gain insights into what's happening in the far North. Few seabirds
venture far into the High Arctic; most live in high densities along the
edges of the Central Arctic Ocean, around the Arctic Ocean gateways.

But the ivory gull is different. It originates [in Canada]{.underline},
Greenland, Svalbard, and Russia, and is dependent on year-round pack ice
--- foraging fish and invertebrates along the productive ice-edge.

However, "Their populations have been declining quite drastically," says
Kathy Kuletz, a wildlife biologist with the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service
and a member of the Circumpolar Seabird Expert Group of the Conservation
of Arctic Flora and Fauna. In the last 20 years, it's estimated that
between 80 and 90% of the ivory gull population has been lost. Only
between 8,000 and 11,500 breeding pairs are left in the world.

In 2017, the Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna, the biodiversity
working group of the Arctic Council, released their State of Arctic
Marine Biodiversity Report. It found that some populations of seabirds
in the Arctic's lower latitudes were also declining; thick-billed murres
in the Atlantic Arctic were decreasing, as were kittiwakes in the
Atlantic Arctic and Davis Strait (between Greenland and Canada's Baffin
Island).

As with other species, climate change is creating winners and losers
among seabirds in an altering Arctic. Though murres, ivory gulls, and
kittiwakes may be struggling, planktivorous seabirds appear to be
increasing in the Chukchi Sea. Conversely, little auk adults are seeing
a decrease in survival rates, perhaps due to negative climate impacts on
their main food source --- Arctic copepods. Black guillemots in the
Beaufort Sea are experiencing more breeding failures as they've been
forced to feed their chicks lesser quality food due to a lower abundance
of polar cod.

The charismatic megafauna

Higher up the food chain, Arctic mammals likewise face an uncertain
future.

In fall of 2021, Fisheries and Oceans Canada will begin consultations on
whether to list ringed seals under the federal Species at Risk Act.
These blubbery pinnipeds have historically been abundant throughout the
Canadian Arctic and are considered a critical prey species forpolar
bears.

During the winter, when snow falls heavily on the sea ice, ringed seals
dig out birth lairs in drifts above their breathing holes. This provides
protection from bears. When spring comes, the ringed seals birth their
pups in these lairs. But without deep snow and ice --- an increasingly
more common condition in a warming Arctic --- ringed seals can't protect
their vulnerable young. That may be why some Inuit communities, who hunt
the animals, say they've witnessed a decline in the seal's numbers in
recent years.

Likewise, the loss of sea ice is driving polar bears onto land where
they can no longer access the seals. In a recent study, scientists
examined the energy needs of polar bears forced ashore, determining that
they would need to consume approximately 1.5 caribou, 37 Arctic char, 74
snow geese, 217 snow goose eggs, or 3 million crowberries to even come
close to the energy provided by the blubber of a single adult ringed
seal.

The polar bears have been expending far more energy searching for food
now than when the sea was in its 'normal' state. It's going to be almost
impossible for polar bears to adapt to life on land as the Arctic sea
ice melts out.

Kotzebue, Alaska. Image by Michael Cameron / NOAA.

Scientists estimate that all but a few polar bear populations will
likely be gone by 2100. The animals will only likely persist in the
Queen Elizabeth Islands --- the northernmost part of the Canadian Arctic
Archipelago --- and still roam into the Central Arctic Basin past
century's end.

Narwhals, the so-called unicorns of the sea, are also struggling.
Reliable breathing holes are harder to come by due to unpredictable
shifts in mobile sea ice. This has led to instances of the marine
mammals becoming trapped and dying under the ice.

"Anything that requires ice as a home, or a platform to hunt from, is
going to start doing worse," says Stanford's Arrigo. But other
transitory species, like gray whales, which feed off the productive
bottom, could do really well as the Arctic becomes more productive.

"A lot of species are going to be coming in from far away," he adds.
"But that's one of the scary things about all this. If they don't time
it correctly, and the Arctic's productivity happens a month earlier, the
migratory species coming in from the Southern Hemisphere will struggle.
There's a hard limit," he says. In a biome as harsh as the Arctic,
there's little room for error.

So, what to do?

In 2018, ten parties signed an international agreement to prevent
unregulated commercial fishing in the Central Arctic Ocean until
scientists have a better understanding of the profound regime shifts
underway. The agreement will also take into account Indigenous and local
knowledge; foster scientific cooperation; and establish conservation and
management measures before any fishing is permitted to occur in the
vulnerable region.

Once all parties have ratified the agreement it will remain in place for
16 years, subject to automatic renewal if all parties agree. As of 2021,
nine out of 10 parties have ratified the agreement, including the United
States, Japan, Russia, and the European Union. Only China has yet to
finalize its participation, irking some governments.

When asked by Mongabay about the delay at a policy forum in February,
Gao Feng, China's special representative for Arctic Affairs, noted that
the agreement was a milestone achievement and insisted that China "has
no political obstacle for the final approval. The only matter is time
and our internal procedure."

Though the climate change planetary boundary may have been crossed
globally, [[rapid **international action** could **curb**]{.mark} the

**[cooperation]{.mark}** between nations, a huge investment in

and a senior fellow in the Defense and Security Department at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies, "Recruiting Friends for the

Q1: What is the ICE Pact?

A1: The U.S. Department of Defense's 2024 Arctic Strategy, published on
July 22, 2024, identifies five concerns for the Arctic's strategic
landscape: China's presence in the Arctic, including the operation of
three icebreakers; Russia's plans and activities in the Arctic;
cooperation between China and Russia; an evolving security architecture;
and climate change's impact on operational ability. An effective U.S.
response to threats in the Arctic requires the ability to operate in the
far north, and that requires icebreakers, of which the United States has
very few.

The ICE Pact aims to increase icebreaker capacity and production and
aligns with NATO's broader goals to increase defense industrial
cooperation. The new trilateral arrangement has three primary goals:
improve information sharing between Canada, Finland, and the United
States, collaborate on developing the skilled workforce for icebreaker
production, and invite allies and partners to buy icebreakers from the
three nations. For this last point, the three members of the ICE Pact
affirmed that while they have the expertise to produce icebreakers, they
need an increase in orders and continual demand to scale production and
build capacity. Cooperation among the three allies---and the search for
a broader market---may be able to yield this.

Shipbuilding has been a weak link in the U.S. defense industrial base,
so it will benefit from collaboration with Canada and Finland. The
Finnish government reports that 60 percent of the world's icebreakers
are produced at Finnish shipyards and 80 percent are designed by Finnish
companies. Last year, one of Canada's shipbuilding companies, Davie
Shipbuilding, purchased a Finnish shipyard that makes icebreakers,
suggesting preexisting industrial cooperation in this sector. This also
highlights the interest of strategic adversaries in the Arctic. While
the shipyard was located in Helsinki, it had previously been owned by a
Russian company, Algador, which led to lengthy regulatory reviews
designed to ensure that the acquisition was not in violation of
sanctions. Before the invasion of Ukraine and subsequent sanctions,
Finnish shipyards received a substantial amount of business from Russia
including a contract to build a ship for a Russian mining company which
was intended to be the most powerful icebreaker ever produced in
Finland. The export license was denied in 2022 after Russia invaded
Ukraine, and the icebreaker was never built.

[[The goal of the ICE Pact]{.mark} is [to enable]{.mark} the three
[nations to build]{.mark} the **shipbuilding capacity** and the
**[icebreakers]{.mark}** they require]{.underline}, with the eventual
industrial base goal of allowing allies and partners to take advantage
of this increased capacity and increase their own capabilities more
affordably. U.S. officials believe allies will require between 70 and 90
icebreakers. Finland views the ICE Pact as a way to contribute to the
alliance by sharing their industry expertise while gaining the larger
market that comes with selling systems and components to ships made in
Canada and the United States. Canada sees [[the ICE Pact as a **pathway
toward protecting**]{.underline}]{.mark} their Arctic sovereignty and
[[the **interests of Indigenous communities** while supporting]{.mark}
the [renewal of]{.mark} their coast guard and [naval
fleets]{.mark}]{.underline} and promoting job growth.

#### International agreements ensure that Indigenous people are involved in maritime development.

In addition, [[Arctic]{.mark} coastal [states have adopted]{.mark}
**national [legislation]{.mark}** [for ships operating in ice-covered
waters]{.mark} within their EEZs [and national **regulations**
regarding]{.mark} navigation [**safety** and **pollution**]{.mark}
prevention]{.underline}. For example, for NSR, [the Russian Federation

Navigating the Northern Sea Route]{.underline}, 1996 (a section of
\"Guide to Navigation through the Northern Sea Route,\" 1996), the Rules

and the Federal Law of July 28, 2012, N 132-FZ \" On Amendments to
Certain Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation Concerning State
Regulation of Merchant Shipping on the Water Area of the Northern Sea
Route\". [Arctic shipping in Canada is governed by several pieces of
legislation,]{.underline} including the Arctic Shipping Safety and
Pollution Prevention Regulations (ASSPPR), the Arctic Water Pollution
Prevention Act, the Canada Shipping Act 2001, the Marine Liability Act,
the Marine Transportation Security Act, the Coasting Trade Act, and the
Canada Labor Code. In addition to the regulations mentioned above,
[[Coastal States' legal]{.mark}, policy, and governance [frameworks
may]{.mark} also [affect **risk assessments**]{.mark} and safety
investments [in the Polar region]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example,
Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and Low-Impact Shipping Corridors may pose
restrictions (e.g., Federal Marine Protected Areas Protection Standard38
) to ship navigation (e.g., no icebreaking in the areas of corridors)
and other activities. Shipping and its impacts in the areas are also
regulated in a number of Oceans Act MPAs. In the past, Canada and other
Coastal States designated MPAs (e.g., Tuvaijuittuq MPA) and planned to
establish new Marine Protected Areas (e.g., Southampton Island) in the
Arctic (DFO, 2019, 2022b). [[The process of establishing new
M]{.mark}arine [P]{.mark}rotected [A]{.mark}reas [includes]{.mark} the
collection and [consideration of]{.mark} ecological and socio-economic
information, **including [indigenous knowledge]{.mark}**, and a risk
assessment must also be completed, as required by Governor-in-Council
Oceans Act MPAs]{.underline} (DFO, 2024). [[The]{.mark} Northern
Low-Impact Shipping Corridors ([**NLISC**)
initiative]{.mark}]{.underline} under Canada's Ocean Protection Plan
(OPP) [[is building **stronger partnerships with Indigenous
communities** in the Arctic and seeks to]{.mark} **protect wildlife**
and the environment, [enhance **marine navigation** safety,]{.mark} and
**guide investments** in the North.]{.underline} The federal government
is working to develop a pilot project in each region of Inuit Nunangat,
which will help the government develop and implement the governance
process that addresses community concerns and guides processes moving
forward (Transport Canada, 2024). Examples of the community-identified
safety recommendations from the NLISC include new or improved charting
in key areas, permanent lighted navigational markers or GPS coordinates
marking reefs to guide ships into the area, and more oil spill equipment
needed (Carter et al., 2017). [Other [**intergovernmental
organizations** participate in the region\'s
**regulation**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[The **Arctic Council**]{.mark} is
a regional intergovernmental forum established to [promote]{.mark}
cooperation, coordination, and [interaction among]{.mark} the [Arctic
states, **Arctic Indigenous people**]{.mark}, and other Arctic
inhabitants [on common]{.mark} Arctic [issues, particularly
**sustainable development**]{.mark} and environmental
protection]{.underline} (Arctic Council, 2022). Although the importance
of its role and efforts made toward sustainable Arctic shipping is
widely acknowledged, unlike the IMO, it does not have the authority to
regulate or implement maritime policies on Arctic issues beyond national
jurisdictions. [One of the Arctic Council\'s critical functions is
cooperation with the IMO on Arctic issues]{.underline}, such as the IMO
Polar Code, the SAR Agreement, and the designation of MARPOL Special
Areas. The matters related to the Arctic maritime safety, security, and
environmental protection should be resolved through cooperating with the
IMO, and the Council\'s AMSA report highlights the importance of the IMO
and calls for the Arctic states to cooperatively support efforts at the
IMO to strengthen, harmonize and regularly update international
standards for vessels operating in the Arctic (AMSA, 2009; Lassi et al.,
2016). With the development of the Arctic, the potential for conflicts
of interest is also raised, for example, between commercial fisheries,
local communities, subsistence livelihoods, and natural resources
exploration companies (Arctic Council, 2016). The Arctic Council can
present the issues and serve as a platform for all stakeholders to
discuss them for such conflicts. Evan Bloom, a former senior diplomat
who represented the U.S during the initial efforts to establish the
Arctic Council, stated his view on the Arctic Council: \"In its current
form, it contributes meaningfully to making the Arctic a region of
stability and minimal conflict -- which is perhaps its most important
role. It keeps the Arctic States talking among themselves; open channels
of communication have a positive impact. Those channels are open at
every level, among the Senior Arctic Officials, among the many
participants of the Working Groups, and at national leadership levels as
well.\" (Evan, 2021, Para.15)
