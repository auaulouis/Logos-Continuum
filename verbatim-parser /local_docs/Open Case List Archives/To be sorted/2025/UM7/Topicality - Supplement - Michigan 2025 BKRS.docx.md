### Note

The and/or cards are to supplement the 2ac card in the original starter
packet t file and reflect the plain meaning and more often legally cited
definition of "and/or".

The "Oil and gas aren't minerals" cards is to answer the debatability
case for "T- must be mineral extraction" because it would demonstrate
that oil/gas drilling affs would be untopical under the negatives
interpretation

## And/or

### And/or---"either" or "both"---2AC

#### And/or unambiguously means "either" OR "both"

**[The use of the term and/or is pervasive in legal
language]{.underline}**. Lawyers use it in all types of legal
contexts---including statutes, contracts, and pleadings. Beginning in
the 1930s, however, many judges decided that the term and/or should
never be used in legal drafting. Ardent attacks on the term included
charges that it was vague, if not meaningless, with some authorities
declaring it to be a "Janus-faced verbal monstrosity," an "inexcusable
barbarism," a "mongrel expression," an "abominable invention," a "crutch
of sloppy thinkers," and "senseless jargon." Still today, **[critics
maintain]{.underline}** that the construct **[and/or is]{.underline}**
inherently **[ambiguous]{.underline}** and should be avoided whenever
possible---which, many detractors would argue, is always.

**[And/or, however, is not ambiguous at all.]{.underline}** **[It has a
definite, agreed-upon meaning]{.underline}**: when used properly, the
construct **[signifies "A or B or both]{.underline}**." In most areas of
law, there is simply no compelling reason to avoid using and/or. **[The
term is clear and concise]{.underline}**. **[It derives criticism mainly
from instances in which people use it incorrectly.]{.underline}**
Pleadings, contracts, statutes, and patent claims all allow for a cogent
use of and/or. Conversely, some legal areas---such as jury instructions,
search warrants, and jury verdicts---do not typically allow a drafter to
provide options, making and/or unsuitable.

**[Courts have held that]{.underline}** and/or sufficiently conveys the
overall intent of the party using it and that the phrase **[and/or has a
definite meaning]{.underline}**, thus often refusing to label it as
ambiguous. When the phrase and/or is used in a party's complaint against
two other parties, courts have held that its use is not ambiguous.
Consider West v. Quality Gold, Inc., 114 in which the defendant argued
that the amended third-party complaint, which implicated him and another
party, was deficient because of the use of and/or. 115 **[The
federal]{.underline}** district **[court]{.underline}** in California,
citing decisions from other circuits, **[determined that the phrase
and/or is commonly construed to mean "the one or the other or
both."]{.underline}**116 The court found that the plaintiff's use of
and/or to combine the parties simply meant either one of them or both of
them.117 As this example illustrates, and/or not only sufficiently
conveys the intent of the parties using it, but it is also a
significantly more efficient and concise form of expression.118

#### Plain meaning of and/or is disjunctive

**[Similar to courts' treatment of the term in general civil complaints,
and/or is often given its plain meaning]{.underline}** in patent
construction.147 Consider Cipher Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Actavis
Laboratories FL, Inc., 148 in which the defendants argued that and/or in
the patent term "the isotretinoin is partially in suspension and/or
partially in solution" rendered the term indefinite.149 Conversely, the
plaintiffs asserted that this term covered products in which the
"isotretinoin is (1) partially in suspension; (2) partially in solution;
and (3) partially in suspension and partially in solution."150 **[The
court agreed]{.underline}** with the plaintiff's construction,
**[holding that it comported with the plain meaning of
and/or]{.underline}**: **[it indicated an inclusive
disjunction]{.underline}** and did not render the claim indefinite.151

Despite the wide-ranging and profound dislike of the term and/or, its
critics fail to acknowledge that it has a definite, useful meaning.24
The separate terms of "and" and "or" are seemingly contradictory,
lending confusion when combining the two terms into and/or. 25
**[Some]{.underline}** **[have]{.underline}** even **[called and/or
"purposely indefinite.]{.underline}**"26 However, this perspective fails
to see that **[and/or]{.underline}**---and at the very least, the
construction of "A and/or B"---**[provides a]{.underline}** **[finite
choice to the reader]{.underline}**.27 **[Using and/or]{.underline}** to
separate two terms, such as "A and/or B," **[invites the reader to
choose only A, only B, or both A and B]{.underline}**.28 **[Thus, a
reader is presented with only three options]{.underline}** when and/or
is used to separate two terms.29

The Final Distinction

**[The most notable difference between minerals and fossil fuels is the
distinction between organic and inorganic substances]{.underline}**.
**[Scientists are able to duplicate minerals in a
laboratory]{.underline}**, which are called synthetics. **[This makes
minerals]{.underline}** a **[renewable]{.underline}** resource.

**[Fossil fuels are organic]{.underline}** in nature and fossilized over
many million years. **[Using them diminishes supply]{.underline}**,
which takes many millions of years to replenish. **[Scientists are not
able to duplicate this process in a laboratory]{.underline}**.
Therefore, they classify fossil fuels as a non-renewable resource.
