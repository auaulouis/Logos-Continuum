# Kritik---High Theory And Death Cult---CCFMLP

I like the psycho K a lot -- Miao

Adam Tahirkeli *insisted* that the death cult K be included in this file
(or the "ballot K" as he originally labeled it). Because I have a weak
will-to-power, I have relented to his demands; however, I have tried to
make it very clear that it's part of this file so that no one misses it.
Hopefully the amount of aff answers that I included will make actually
going for it too difficult.

I'm actually not sure if Andrew Yim contributed evidence to this file or
not, because Miao Sun compiled it and did most of the work (including
many requests for reorganization and more aff cards), but he was in the
Slack group chat for it, so I want to make sure he gets credit if he did
pitch in. Regardless, props to him for evidence contributed elsewhere
and for generally being a good labbie. EDIT: Apparently Andrew did not
contribute cards, but Matthew Ciancanelli did. Shout out to Matthew too!

### 1NC

#### The 1AC is an act of ontological security, attempting to cohere and control the World via the establishment of fantasy in an attempt to reach the ephemeral Real. That reifies the Lack, creating psychic harm and reifies suffering.

[Ontological security]{.underline} provides a [valuable departure point
for discussing]{.underline} the [analytical array of
Lacanian]{.underline} [psychoanalysis]{.underline} and [orienting it
towards the phenomenon of far-right normalisation]{.underline} by
[focusing]{.underline} on the **[subject49 immersed in this
fantasy]{.underline}**. Contrary to [common
misunderstandings]{.underline} and [misreadings]{.underline},
[Lacanian]{.underline} psychoanalysis does not deal with the [subject as
pertaining to an individual but instead as lack]{.underline} -- as a
**[void bereft of essence]{.underline}** -- dependent or subjectified by
and to the Symbolic Order (Lacan, 1998, pp. 77--78; Stavrakakis, 1999,
pp. 36--37; Van Haute, 2001, pp. 159--161). [Lacan views the
subject]{.underline} (usually departing from the figure of an infant)
[as emerging through its entry into the Symbolic Order]{.underline} --
this is, its entry into the realm of language, culture, and law (2006,
pp. 12, 227; see also Van Haute, 2001, p. 10). This [entry is marked by
a traumatic split, where the now-subject loses its
pre-sociolinguistic]{.underline} [wholeness]{.underline}, generating a
[constitutive lack built around an ultimately unattainable
object-cause]{.underline} of [desire]{.underline}. Lacan [understands
this split as the **moment of subjectivity itself,**]{.underline} where
the ["I" is divided into]{.underline} [ego or
false/illusory]{.underline} self -- the mask with which we traverse
[sociosymbolic]{.underline} [space]{.underline} -- and the
**[unconscious]{.underline}** -- the [Symbolic's machination through/as
the subject (]{.underline}Evans, 2006; pp. 197-198; Lacan, 1998, p. 26).
Contrary to misconceptions stemming from psychological, behaviouralist,
and critical theory approaches, the [unconscious is not some "inner
world" holding the "true essence" of the individual]{.underline}, but
rather the [structuring machination of the Symbolic Order through the
subject]{.underline} (Fink, 1995, pp. 7--9; C. Jones, 2020; Lacan, 1998,
p. 77). The split subject is not reduced to what is commonly
conceptualised as an individual or "self" but rather encompasses more
complex assemblages of existence, like groups, families, nations,
political systems, and even technologies (see C. Jones, 2020; Millar,
2021; Stavrakakis, 1999, pp. 3--4). [The subject is, thus, not an innate
or universal human condition or entity but a **possibility structured as
sheer lack**]{.underline} and [conditioned by the process of
signification on whatever ontological assemblage it
encompasses]{.underline}. The subject is created upon the entity's entry
into the Symbolic realm, [which is irremediably signified in language
(e]{.underline}.g., "I am a Swede / Father / Protestant / Patriot"). The
subject does not exist in a traditional sense but is a naturalised
façade. [This mask does not cover a "real truth" or fixity]{.underline}
(Lacan, 1998, p. 48, 2006, p. 153), but rather is the [operation of the
unconscious through the illusion of the self.]{.underline} In short,
"[the subject is nothing but \[its\] split"]{.underline} (Fink, 1995, p.
45; see also Lacan, 2006, pp. 286, 436), and it is experienced as a
[structuring fantasy of ontological security]{.underline}.
Simultaneously, the [split's residual fantasy, the ego, is]{.underline}
the [stabilising]{.underline} [fantasy]{.underline} of the "self" and
thus governs the illusion of a "conscious sense of agency" (Evans, 2006,
pp. 197-198). [The identification with this self-image, through what
Lacan labels the infant's "mirror stage", as "whole]{.underline}" and
coherent represents the subject's inextricable misrecognition
(méconnaissance) since the [ego's formation through the split with the
unconscious can never be fully]{.underline} [reintegrated nor
grasped]{.underline} (Evans, 2006, p. 11; Kinnvall & Svensson, 2022;
Lacan, 2006, pp. 808-809). This [misrecognition]{.underline},
paradoxically, is what [enables the subject's sense or experience of
agency]{.underline}. [Agency is both "possible" and **ultimately
illusory**]{.underline} as it [resides in the subject's
inescapable]{.underline} [misrecognition]{.underline}, and thus, it is
curtailed by the unassailable current of the unconscious via the
Symbolic order (cf. Ruti, 2014; Sheikh, 2017). This paradoxical and
anti-essentialist quality of the subject acts as a departure point,
signifying the value of the post-clinical adaptation of Lacanian
psychoanalysis to the study of political phenomena (Stavrakakis, 1999,
p. 36). For Lacan, the condition and function of the subject are
organised in the interdependence and interplay of the three psychic
realms: The Symbolic, the Imaginary, and the Real. [The Symbolic Order,
the "linguistically-constituted social order"]{.underline} (Pohl &
Swyngedouw, 2023, p. 3), [governs intersubjectivity]{.underline} and
**[shapes reality]{.underline}** by [providing the coordinates for the
production of **fantasies like ontological security**]{.underline} (see
also Fink, 1995, p. 56). This Order plays a crucial and [paradoxical
role in the subject's]{.underline} [psyche]{.underline}. It structures
the possibility of pursuing desires through fantasies (Hoens, 2020, p.
48), yet this perpetually effectuates the lack and anxiety stemming from
the subject's entry into the sociosymbolic realm (Glynos, 2001). In
other words, the Symbolically-organised pursuit of desire involves
perpetuating the anxiety-inducing lack that, in turn, mobilises the
subject towards the relentless yet ultimately fruitless attempts at
satisfying desire (Van Haute, 2001, pp. 106-107; see also Glynos, 2001;
Hook, 2017). For Lacanian ontological security scholars, this
[**anxiety**-**induced** (and infusing) yet **incessant motion**
**towards our desire is** what marks the subject as "becoming" rather
than "being]{.underline}" (Kinnvall, 2017). Lacan argues that desire is
withheld or arrested by the figure of the Other, which is both "other"
persons (i.e., experienced in our desire for their recognition to
produce stable identifications) and the "big Other": [the manifestation
of the Symbolic authority]{.underline}, the "space containing the
[signifiers]{.underline} that precede and [undermine any
subjectivity"]{.underline} (Hoens, 2020, p. 48). Thus, [**desire** is
the **politically** **mobilising**, **socially conditioned possibility**
of both **filling the subject's** **lack**]{.underline} and
[perpetuating]{.underline} it (Stavrakakis, 1999, p. 44; Lacan, 2006,
pp. 450-451). Meanwhile, the [Imaginary Order]{.underline} governs our
identities and fantasies, which are [shaped by the Symbolic structure or
chain of signification]{.underline}. It provides meaning and narratives
to the [otherwise abstract and ungraspable structure of the
Symbolic,]{.underline} [allowing it to work through and as
us]{.underline} (Hook, 2017; Žižek, 2009). The [Imaginary]{.underline}
is the domain where the [subject's ego]{.underline} -- the [inherently
unstable narrative of the self]{.underline} (Homer, 2020, p. 99) -- [is
formed]{.underline} through imaginary identifications with images, and
thus, where constitutive and differentiating [fantasies about the self
and Others are constructed]{.underline} (Lacan, 2006, p. 40-41; Machin,
2020; Mouffe, 2005). It is through the Imaginary that ["the symbolic
takes hold in even the deepest recesses]{.underline} of the human
organism" (Lacan, 2006, p. 6). Given its vast complexity, the Symbolic
Order cannot be fully grasped by the subject but rather is encountered
in, or partially accessed through, historically-contingent, [imaginary
articulations like "modernity", "late capitalism", the liberal
international order, or "the nation"]{.underline} (Machin, 2020;
Walkerdine, 2020; Wilson, 2017) -- i.e., "imaginary impregnations
\[acting as\] [partializations of the symbolic alternative that give the
signifying chain its appearance" and meaning]{.underline} (Lacan, 2006,
p. 6). **[Fantasies of ontological security]{.underline}** are [thus
powerful "symbolic]{.underline} [partializations]{.underline}" that
shape the [Symbolic order of **liberal modernity** -- i.e., the modern
liberal order under neoliberalism]{.underline} (Waklerdine, 2020;
Wilson, 2017). These ideologically interpellate its subjects (cf. Žižek,
2009, pp. 15-16), conditioning the affective normalisation of the
farright (Kisić-Merino & Kinnvall, 2023). The final and most complex
component of the Lacanian Borromean knot, the **[Real]{.underline}**, is
the order of the un-signifiable and [traumatic]{.underline}, what
[exists prior to and **beyond language**]{.underline}. The [Real is
not]{.underline} reality -- the [subjective experience shaped by
fantasies in pursuit]{.underline} [of stabilising pleasure]{.underline}
(Lacan, 2006, p. 324; Evans, 2006, p. 164) -- but the realm of the
inassimilable, which resists symbolisation and is [manifested and
experienced in fantasmatic and symbolic dislocation]{.underline} (Evans,
2006, p. 162). The Symbolic Order and the fantasies that give it meaning
are inherently incomplete and limited due to the limitations of its
signifiers (language and, broadly speaking, law) since they exist
negating or in opposition to other articulations (Glynos, 2001). The
[Real is a structure encountered when Symbolic]{.underline}
[identifications and imaginary concoctions fail.]{.underline} However,
for Lacan, this [process of the]{.underline} Real is what,
paradoxically, also [supports fantasy as much as the latter **"protects
the real"**]{.underline} (1998, p. 41). The Real's indifference to and
transcendence of the Symbolic Order implies its equal disregard for the
subject and its pleasure. [The Real triggers anxiety and trauma by
submerging fantasmatically-articulated reality into
overwhelming]{.underline} (im)possibility (Lacan, 2006, p. 324), which,
in turn, [mobilises]{.underline} the ([re)generation of fantasy
as]{.underline} a defence mechanism. Bruce Fink argues that the
[Real]{.underline} is what [precedes language, what constitutes the
"blissful" pre-sociosymbolic state of]{.underline} the
([future]{.underline}) split subject where its lack and (thus) desire
have not been developed (1995, p. 24; see also Homer, 2020, pp. 98-99).
[Lacan's statement that "the **lack of the lack makes the real,** which
emerges only there]{.underline} [as a cork"]{.underline} (1998, p. ix)
attends to the Real's "blockage" of the motion of desire resulting from
"lacking lack", which leads to sociosymbolic dislocations caused by (and
experienced as) anxiety. For Yannis Stavrakakis, the [**renovation of
lack** through **anxiety** implies the **renovation of** **desire** in
the]{.underline} [form of **new political articulations**]{.underline}.
In other words, the encounter with [the Real is a
quintessential]{.underline} [moment of political and historical movement
since it leads to "the antagonistic articulation of]{.underline}
[different discourses that attempt to symbolise \[the Real's\] traumatic
nature,]{.underline} to **[suture the lack]{.underline}** it creates"
(1999, p. 74; see also Burgess, 2017). [In turn, discourse is the
articulation of signifiers that]{.underline} [shape intersubjectivity
against the Real,]{.underline} mediated by fantasmatic meanings, and
regulated by the Symbolic's demands, i.e., "a social bond, founded in
language" (D. Evans, 2006, p. 45; Lacan, 1999, p. 17). The multifaceted
and complex interaction between [Lacan's three orders]{.underline} of
existence points to the crucial role of the [interplay between fantasy,
desire]{.underline} (and its object-cause), and [anxiety]{.underline}
for the **[analysis of political dislocation]{.underline}** -- i.e.,
[the **generation of crisis**]{.underline} -- embedded in phenomena like
far-right normalisation. For [Lacan, the subject is fundamentally void,
perpetually changing and reconstituting its identity and symbolic
attachments according to the demands of the Symbolic]{.underline} Order
(2006, p. 84). This subject [constantly attempts to stabilise
itself]{.underline} [against]{.underline} its constitutive
[lack]{.underline} -- the void that binds it to [unrealisable desires
and prospects of fulfilment]{.underline} -- **[via ontological
security]{.underline}** **[fantasies]{.underline}** (Browning, 2018;
Eberle, 2019). These fantasies should not be understood as an
abstraction but rather as stabilising responses to our inescapable lack
and otherwise overwhelming Symbolic commitments (Lacan, 2006, pp.
84-85). Fantasies like ontological security constitute what we interpret
as political, social, cultural, and affective reality (Evans, 2006, p.
164). [Fantasy is a "narrative that structures our experience of
reality, organizing our pursuit of desire"]{.underline} (Maher, 2023, p.
2), and thus, it constitutes a core analytical and [ontological
ordinance of antagonistic political reality]{.underline} (Sharpe &
Turner, 2020; Stavrakakis, 1999, pp. 108--109). For Slavoj Žižek, the
political kernel of fantasy can be prominently attested in how ideology
operates through the subject, shaping its desire. [For Žižek, ideology
is a form of fantasy that transcends knowledge and instead is found in
the structure of the unconscious]{.underline}. The subject becomes
sociopolitically bound due to its misrecognition not of social reality
but rather of the illusion that structures said reality -- i.e., the
ideological fantasy (2009, pp. 29-30; see also Hook, 2017).

The [ontological security]{.underline} **[fantasy]{.underline}** is a
[compelling illusion that politically organises]{.underline} (i.e.,
ideologically interpellates; Mandelbaum, 2023) [the subject around the
**unconscious desire to quench** **lack** or recapture primordial
fullness]{.underline} (Kinnvall & Svensson, 2022). In the so-called
Western hemisphere, this "quest" can be attested in the conveyance and
appeal of far-right discourses as vessels of White, "Western"
civilisational anxiety, which [effectuate belonging through
**positioning the "threatening"**]{.underline} **[Other]{.underline}**
(Le Monde, 2023; PA Media, 2023; Schultheis, 2018) as, e.g., "poisoning
the blood of our nation" (Michael, 2023). In Lacanian terms, the
[subject's quest or desire for ontological security is]{.underline}
[oriented by the object-cause of desire]{.underline} (or objet petit a;
Lacan, 2006, p. 571). This [object-cause is the]{.underline} remnant or
[surplus from the subject's entrance into the sociosymbolic]{.underline}
[realm]{.underline} -- it is what [simultaneously pulls and causes
**desire** yet cannot be fully re-integrated into the
Symbolic]{.underline} (Glynos, 2001). The [position of the object-cause
of desire at "the centre of the symbolic framework of the \[subject's\]
self-understanding causes us to desire it]{.underline}" (Vulović &
Ejdus, 2024, p. 126), which evidences a "push-and-pull dynamic between
the agent and the object" (ibid.). [Desire manifests in insatiably
seeking **fulfilment via the objectcause of desire**,]{.underline} a
"longing to retrieve \[the\] primordial bliss" (jouissance) lost in our
painful entry to [the Symbolic Order, **manifested politically** in,
e.g., an ethnically homogeneous and **purportedly harmonious**
**past**]{.underline} (Pohl & Swyngedouw, 2023, p. 3). [Ontological
security recasts **security** as **fantasmatic fullness**]{.underline},
a [promise of recapturing the longed-for]{.underline} [objet petit
a]{.underline} that simultaneously [forces the encounter with its loss
and, thus, with]{.underline} [overwhelming]{.underline} (yet
**[politically-mobilising]{.underline}**) **[anxiety]{.underline}**
(Stavrakakis, 1999, p. 82; Van Haute, 2001, pp. 115-116). Vulović and
Ejdus argue that anxiety is about the lost object-cause of desire around
which fantasy is structured. [Thus, anxiety is a way to sustain desire
when its object-cause is absent, **which conversely makes desire --
through fantasy** -- a "remedy for anxiety" (Evans, 2006, p.
11).]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--L\-\--Climate

#### Climate change is the affirmative's objet a, the target of the Lack's desire. Their attempt at climate policy is a self-sabotaging fantasy to suture the void, which only reifies the Real.

(pronounced \[ˈeːrɪk ˈsʋɪŋɣədʌu\]) is professor of geography at the

[Lacanian psychoanalytic]{.underline} [theory]{.underline} is
notoriously complex, jargon-filled, and occasionally inconsistent (see,
for example, Žižek Citation1992, Fink Citation1995, McGowan
Citation2004). Nonetheless, it has become [increasingly influential in
recent years to account for political transformations]{.underline} (or
lack thereof) (Žižek Citation1999, McGowan Citation2013, Stavrakakis
Citation1999, Citation2007, Tomšič and Zevnik Citation2015, Pohl and
Swyngedouw Citation2021a, Citation2021b) and to [situate]{.underline}
and explain [particular socio-ecological and political-ecological
conditions (]{.underline}Fletcher Citation2013; Healy, Citation2010,
Watt Citation2021, Dodds Citation2011).

In what follows, we shall [mobilize the Lacanian]{.underline} notion of
[fantasy]{.underline} and how [this operates through]{.underline}
[different subject positions that organize the social bond.]{.underline}
For Lacan, these [subject positions]{.underline} (or discourses)
[operate in relationship to **object a**]{.underline} (the object-cause
of desire) on the one hand and to the Discourse of the Master on the
other (Fink Citation2018). We shall briefly explore the key Lacanian
insights as they relate to the particular forms of denial that infuse
different climate positions and discourses. As suggested above, [climate
populism is predicated upon a **process of denial**]{.underline}
[whereby a trauma/desire too painful to be symbolised and represented
becomes locked into the subconscious]{.underline}, [but nonetheless
exerts an **irresistible pull**]{.underline} -- precisely because
unsymbolised [-- on personal and political acting, despite]{.underline}
its [inconsistency with respect to the climate]{.underline}
[knowledge]{.underline} that is [explicitly]{.underline} symbolised and
fully [endorsed]{.underline} (Weintrobe Citation2013, Orange
Citation2017). This perspective provides the basis both for a [**radical
revision** of the theoretical place of ideology]{.underline} (fantasy in
Lacanian parlance) and for [situating its functioning in the structuring
of everyday private and collective life.]{.underline}

In the long historical genealogy of the theoretical debate on ideology,
the dominant view is one whereby [ideology is understood as a veil
between people's understanding]{.underline} of the world on the one hand
and the true or real situation, [which is obscured by an 'ideological'
gaze, on the other]{.underline} (Sharpe and Turner Citation2019). [It
was]{.underline} the task of both ideology critique and of the sciences
more generally to excavate the truth of the situation, thereby
[piercing]{.underline} [the]{.underline} ideological [veil]{.underline}
and [open a space]{.underline} that [permitted a non-alienated and
transparent relationship between knowing and acting**, freed from
ideological 'distortions'.**]{.underline} Of course, this view was
fundamentally [predicated on the possibility of rendering reality fully
symbolizable and, therefore, knowable.]{.underline}

Slavoj [Žižek]{.underline} transformed this perspective by
[insisting]{.underline}, following Lacan, [that everyday life itself
is]{.underline} [structured as fantasy.]{.underline} In other words,
[everyday practices are structured as an (ideological)
fantasy]{.underline}, one that **[represses an underlying
Real]{.underline}**, which remains elusive. For Žižek, [the Real refers
to the unsymbolizable but nonetheless active **movement of capitalist
relations**]{.underline} and their associated class conflicts and
tensions (Büscher-Ulbrich Citation2018). For him, therefore, [ideology
does not function]{.underline} as a [false representation]{.underline}
that covers a hidden, but recoverable, reality, but is [the actual
lived]{.underline} [experience]{.underline} through [which a semblance
of social order is produced,]{.underline} one that **[locks the
Real]{.underline}** of the [situation in an unconscious
register]{.underline} (Žižek Citation1994).

[Social order]{.underline} is, for Jacques Lacan, [established by the
Symbolic (and the Imaginary]{.underline}) and is
[discursively]{.underline} [structured]{.underline}. However, he insists
on the [void at the heart of the Symbolic.]{.underline} For Lacan, the
[world]{.underline} of the symbolic order is always
**[lacking]{.underline}** (Newman Citation2004a; Citation2004b). It is
an [unstable, shifting]{.underline}, and [necessarily incomplete
register]{.underline}. There is [always excess, a remainder or
reminder]{.underline}, that cannot be symbolised or represented; a hard
kernel that sticks like a fishbone in the throat and exerts an
unalienable scratch or pull. This [lure of the excessive
remainder]{.underline} is what [Lacan calls the Real, a]{.underline}
[complex, shifting spectral presence that 'resists symbolisation
absolutely']{.underline} (Lacan Citation1991a: 66). There is always a
gap between the Real as the 'unassimilable' (Lacan Citation1977, p. 55)
and any attempt at its symbolic assimilation.

Within this slippery and inconsistent configuration, [the Imaginary
provides an illusionary sense of]{.underline} [coherence or completeness
of the world]{.underline}. It operates through a **[performative
fantasy]{.underline}** that [permits]{.underline} [life]{.underline} to
be [lived in an illusion of coherence]{.underline} and fulfilment. The
[Imaginary operates through fantasy]{.underline}, the potent operator
that [makes us experience life as full and somehow
meaningful]{.underline}. Of course, for **[fantasy]{.underline}** to
[integrate successfully the individual into an illusion of an undivided
subject,]{.underline} it must [deny]{.underline}, that is repress,
disavow, or foreclose, **[the Real]{.underline}**, covering up 'the
revolt', [locking it into the unconscious.]{.underline} Nonetheless, it
is precisely drive -- or the lack, [gap]{.underline}, excess -- that
will [animate]{.underline} the [Imaginary]{.underline} and
[fuel]{.underline} **[fantasy]{.underline}**, and that keeps on
**[insisting on fulfilment]{.underline}**, but [invariably displaced
into the register of jouissance **(enjoyment**]{.underline}), the
[insatiable (because impossible) search for full satisfaction
articulated]{.underline} [around object a,]{.underline} the 'little
piece of the Real' that sets desire into motion.
**[Fantasy]{.underline}**, in sum, is precisely the [terrain through
which **repressing, foreclosing, or disavowing** the Real is
effectuated]{.underline}, yet in doing so, it [launches the subject into
an abyss that will invariably return in the form of, among other,
anxiety, pain, **insecurity**, **depression**, **melancholia**,
hysterical acting out, or obsessive repetitive rituals]{.underline}
(Pohl and Swyngedouw Citation2021a). This is why one of the [crucial
aims of psychoanalysis]{.underline}, for Lacan, is to '[**traverse the
fantasy'** and to 'encounter the Real']{.underline} (Lacan Citation1977,
p. 273).

The [social bond propels the three registers of the Imaginary, the
Symbolic, and the Real not solely onto the subject]{.underline}, but
also onto the [terrain]{.underline} of social, cultural, and
**[political life]{.underline}** (Wilson and Swyngedouw Citation2014).
For Lacan, there are [four discourses that pertain to different
subject-positions with respect to the practices that structure
social]{.underline} relationships and the social bond, and they reflect
different relationships to desire and enjoyment (Klepec Citation2016).
As Mark Bracher insists, 'discourse is a necessary structure that
subsists in certain fundamental relations that are intra-subjective,
social, or with the nonhuman world' (Bracher Citation1994b: 107). Lacan
names these four discourses as respectively of the Master, the
University, the Hysteric, and the Analyst (Lacan Citation2007).

3.1. The discourse of the master: sustaining unsustainability

The Discourse of the Master operates through the Imaginary and the
Symbolic. The [Symbolic]{.underline} [stands]{.underline} for the
assemblage of [institutions, laws, formal and informal rules,
regulations, and actors that constitute society as a fully closed
configuration]{.underline} (Dean Citation2006). It [quilts a chain of
signifiers]{.underline} (like democracy, state, cohesion, freedom, etc.
for liberal democracy) -- a discourse -- that [sustains]{.underline} the
[order]{.underline} and [assigns everyone a certain place]{.underline}
within the social edifice. It [constitutes the]{.underline}
[Law]{.underline} (the big Other) that [prescribes, enjoins, prohibits,
entices, punishes, or rewards]{.underline}. The Master tells us what to
do and what not, what to desire and, most importantly, how to desire. It
assigns and ascribes a place and a function to all; it tells us who and
what we are or should be (Gunder and Hillier Citation2009). In the
present configuration, the [symbolic order constitutes the pluralist
representative institutions of government, the formal and informal rules
that order the social bond]{.underline}, the [arrangements that organize
**universalized commodity exchange** as the mode of socio-ecological
production and reproductio]{.underline}n. Of course, as implied above,
this is a symbolic representation of something that has neither unity
nor coherence and is utterly contingent.

The symbolic dimension of the Master Discourse that [**sustains the
dominant climate configuration** revolves around particular discursive
enchainment]{.underline}. The master signifier here is of course
'[Climate Change as a Problem']{.underline}, i.e. the [excessive
**accumulation of greenhouse gases** that drives global warming and
causes a significant problem to the present socio-ecological
configuration]{.underline}. Humans are co-responsible and action
requires a combination of individual adjustment and appropriate
[techno-managerial governance such that things can go on as
'normal';]{.underline} '**[sustainability']{.underline}** becomes the
central '[empty']{.underline} Master **[signifier]{.underline}**
(Swyngedouw Citation2007). As Ingolfur Blühdorn (Citation2013,
Citation2017) has repeatedly argued, [the dominant climate discourse and
practice **sustains the** **sustainability of
unsustainability**]{.underline}, referring to the process whereby the
[very socio-technical and governance **procedures mobilized** to
mitigate the problem in fact **sustain**]{.underline} the very process
that produces [**unsustainability**.]{.underline}

The [Imaginary]{.underline} part of the Discourse of the Master can be
identified as the view that [pluralist liberal]{.underline}
[democracy]{.underline}-cum-market-economy is the [only workable,
realistic, and quasi-naturalised social order]{.underline} -- one
without excess, remainder, or gap. The Imaginary is the **[terrain of
fantasy,]{.underline}** of [giving meaning and providing a sense of
coherence and wholeness.]{.underline} It is [constituted through
seductive and **alluring images** of **wholesomeness**]{.underline},
often providing an [illusionary sense]{.underline} of
**[unity]{.underline}** and **[transparency]{.underline}** (Galanopoulos
and Stavrakakis Citation2019, p. 10). It [offers a way through which
things and relations are seen and understood as common sense and
self-evident]{.underline}. The [fantasy]{.underline} screen that
[nurtures the imaginary]{.underline} [promises]{.underline} of the
[environmental]{.underline} Master Discourse [circles]{.underline}
around a [particular **fantasy of what 'Nature' is**]{.underline}
(Stavrakakis Citation1999, pp. 62--63), [articulated through **empty
signifiers** like sustainability,]{.underline} adaptation, [resilience,
socio-ecological inclusion and socio-ecological harmony]{.underline}
(Swyngedouw Citation2007). The [lure]{.underline} of this [**fantasy**
circles around **simultaneously portraying a catastrophic and horrifying
future**]{.underline} to be avoided and [promising the possibility of a
return to a lost but presumable wholesome world for both human and
non-human earthlings]{.underline}, a promise that can be realized within
the framework of the existing system. Of course, [this imaginary of a
**presumably lost arcadian** **environment** or climate that has to be
restored never really existed.]{.underline}

The [Imaginary invariably covers up or **conceals** the abyss between
the Real]{.underline} (of capital) and the [Symbolic]{.underline}.
**[Fantasy]{.underline}** becomes the mechanism through which the gap
that [marks their inconsistency is containe]{.underline}d (Žižek
Citation1997). We can [even consume ourselves out of unethical ways of
producing]{.underline} (by buying environmentally responsible and
ethically sourced products) [or of unsustainable ecological
practices]{.underline} (by offsetting our carbon footprint). Indeed, the
[climate]{.underline} Master [discourse]{.underline}
[displaces]{.underline} the realization of the [fantasy script onto
object a,]{.underline} the object-cause of desire, and this becomes
[crystallized]{.underline} [around a 'thing' -- in this case
**greenhouse gases**]{.underline} -- that is [staged as both the cause
of and the entity around which the realization of desire becomes
articulated]{.underline}. Since enjoyment is never fully attainable,
such a [fantasy]{.underline} screen permits us to [**displace the lack
of satisfaction** on to something or someone else who has 'it' and has
stolen it from us]{.underline} (like the migrants who steal our jobs,
CO2 that makes our planet heat up, elites that revel in pleasure on our
back, etc.) (Žižek Citation1993, p. 203). [**CO2** and other
**greenhouse gases** become as such the fetishized **foe** that requires
sequestration as the means to **achieve a fully harmonious
socio-climatic world** while **sustaining libidinal attachment to the
existing order.**]{.underline}

Indeed, the [**symbolic/imaginary** formation of a world is always
**incomplete**]{.underline}, [fails inherently to suture fully the
social order]{.underline}. This [remainder]{.underline}, the
**[Real]{.underline}**, i.e. that which cannot be symbolised by the
existing interplay of political forces, [disrupts and
destabilises]{.underline}. The Real is [both unaccounted for in the
symbolic order and excluded from the imaginary register.]{.underline} As
it escapes symbolisation, it can only be discerned in a slanted way.
[The Real becomes spectrally sensed through symptoms that both reveal
and hide the truth of the repressed.]{.underline}

For example, in the [climate context, the continuing growth of
greenhouse emissions]{.underline}, the obsession with [sustaining the
'**mad dance of accumulation'**]{.underline}, the [**deepening** of all
manner of **socio-ecological** **attachments**,]{.underline} and the
spectral presences of the [class relation that underpin global
capitalism are customarily negated]{.underline}. The place of the Real
is taken by, for example, [undocumented]{.underline}
[migrants]{.underline} for xeno-nationalist populists [or by carbon for
climate populists]{.underline} and this often figures as the excessive
torsion point, 'an alien intruder' (Stavrakakis Citation1999, p. 108),
which shatters the myth of unity. They are the supernumerary excess,
standing in the way of 'our' enjoyment. [In doing so, it interrupts the
symbolic order as that what cannot be symbolised without changing the
very co-ordinates of the symbolic order.]{.underline}

In the discursive cacophony around the climate conundrum, there are a
series of positions that nonetheless all circulate around and/or support
the Master narrative. The direct opposition to the Master discourse is
its disavowal, the radical denial of the existence of the Master, and
replacing it with an attempt to install another Master discourse that
nonetheless still sustains the Real of the situation. This is the
position of climate change deniers or minimizers. For them, there is not
really a problem; it is staged by a particular set of elites, sustained
by a particular scientific narrative in order to oppress the people and
undermine their enjoyment. This is the location of people like Donald
Trump or Jair Bolsonaro, is classically defined by Lacan as the
pervert's position, and is closely associated with 'mainstream'
right-wing populism (Gunn Citation2018).

3.2. [The **discourse of the university**: **change without change** and
the **repression of the real**]{.underline}

The [Discourse of the University refers not only to the symbolic
universe of knowledge and science, but also to the
discourses]{.underline} (and practices) of management and governance
with which the discourse of science is deeply intertwined. The
[**Discourse of the University** is a crucial support
structure]{.underline} for the Master Discourse: it [nurtures, endorses,
legitimizes, and feeds the Discourse]{.underline} of the Master (Tomšič
Citation2015). The Discourse of the University does not refer to the
full range of work undertaken by in intellectuals or researchers. The
[Discourse of the University includes the **discourse of governance**
**combined** with those '**university' discourses that
support,**]{.underline} often critically, the master governance
discourse. Indeed, the [overwhelming share of the contributions of the
climate science community]{.underline} [focuses on the chemo-physical
characteristics and dynamics of the earth and climate
system]{.underline}, and the role of greenhouse gases. The
**[geo-engineering]{.underline}** and **[environmental
technologies]{.underline}** contributions, in turn, tend to [focus on
carbon remediation, sequestration, and carbon-saving technologies,
while]{.underline} [sustainability science and transition research
focusses on **techno-managerial and institutional**]{.underline}
**[arrangements]{.underline}** that [permit adaptation or mitigation to
climate change]{.underline}, thereby further [deepening]{.underline} the
[consensual discourse that disavows or forecloses focusing on underlying
dynamics]{.underline} that produce the problem in the first place. Mark
Bracher insists indeed that '[The University discourse]{.underline}
functions as an avatar of the Master discourse,
[promulgating]{.underline} master [signifiers hidden behind systematic
knowledge']{.underline} (Bracher Citation1994b, p. 117; Lacan 1991, p.
172--173). The [power and legitimacy]{.underline} of the Discourse of
the University is [sustained by a **fantasy of neutrality, objectivity,
universalism**,]{.underline} and [expert-knowledge]{.underline} that
[supports]{.underline} the [Discourse]{.underline} of the Master and
[frames both **strategic action** and **techno-managerial
interventions** that point to the need to change rapidly but **without
fundamentally altering** the prevalent **socio-ecological
relations.**]{.underline}

3.3. the discourse of the hysteric: [**CO2 as object cause of
desire**]{.underline} and the [interrogation]{.underline} of the
[discourse]{.underline} of the master

The [third position in the Lacanian discursive quadrangle is the
Discourse]{.underline} of the [Hysteric]{.underline}. In this discourse
and associated practices, the [key position is taken by the subject who
interrogat]{.underline}es the Master with respect [to the desire that
seems to emanate]{.underline} [from]{.underline} the Master
[Discourse]{.underline}, but is registered as [duplicitous
and]{.underline} [lacking]{.underline} (Bracher Citation1994b; Fink
Citation1995). With respect to the consensualised climate change
argument, the Master's [desire crystallizes around '**managing'**
**greenhouse gases**]{.underline} in order to [save both human and
non-human earthly futures in a sustainable manner]{.underline}
(Swyngedouw Citation2018), and this can be [achieved with appropriate
techno-managerial adjustment]{.underline} [that **leave intact the
mechanisms that produce climate change**]{.underline}. The Discourse of
the Hysteric, while [taking seriously the nodal point that CO2 takes as
object-cause of desire]{.underline}, interrogates the Master as to its
'real' intentions, thereby questioning, countering, and critiquing the
Discourse of the Master, while seeking to uncover what the Master really
wants. Part of the critical environmental research community provides an
academic support structure for this Hysterical position.

Here we encounter the climate activists who suspect and distrust the
Master, and bombard those in power with demands to take seriously
climate science and to take appropriate action. [The always failing
response of those in power to act decisively nurtures and intensifies
the activists' engagement and repertoires of action]{.underline}. The
Master's resp[onse is always lacking, insufficient, thereby heightening
the critical position of the hysteric]{.underline} viz-a-viz the Master.
More importantly, the [position]{.underline} of the Master is hereby
**[further deepened through relentless questioning]{.underline}**,
**[interrogating]{.underline}**, and **[hoisting further
demands]{.underline}** (Newman 2004). Rather than [changing the
co-ordinates of the existing configuration]{.underline}, this
[hysterical condition **further** deepens the deadlock of the
**hegemonic climate consensus**.]{.underline} [**X-tinction**
**Rebellion** or Youth for Climate are]{.underline} canonical [examples
of]{.underline} climate [activism]{.underline} that urges the elites to
take decisive action. This [reproduces]{.underline} the **[existing
power configurations]{.underline}** that produce the problem in the
first place. Moreover, it [further solidifies the consensual
view]{.underline} that [averting]{.underline} [climate]{.underline}
[chaos]{.underline} and [producing a socially inclusive and ecologically
sustainable configuration]{.underline} revolves around dealing with the
**[fethishized 'thing called CO2']{.underline}** [rather than **changing
the Real** of the **relations producing the 'thing'.**]{.underline} In
doing so, [such forms of hysterical acting-out]{.underline}, articulated
around fetishistic [displacement, permit]{.underline} both [demanding
change and leaving the structural parameters intact]{.underline}
(Fletcher Citation2018). Such forms of **[climate
activism]{.underline}** maintain a [deep **libidinal attachment** to the
existing configuration]{.underline}, while [disavowing the intensely
political nature of the problem,]{.underline} which revolves around
transforming the socio-ecological relations of production and
reproduction.

4\. Traversing the trauma and encircling the real, or ... . how not to
succumb to the populist temptation

In the Lacanian universe, the fourth discourse, the [Discourse of the
Analyst,]{.underline} revolves around **[nudging]{.underline}** the
[analysands to **interrogate** their **object-cause of**
**desire**]{.underline}. This [requires]{.underline} what Lacan names as
**['traversing the fantasy',]{.underline}** that is to [traverse the
imaginaries that elevate a thing to the object cause of desire (object
a):]{.underline}

The [analyst's **ethical commitment** is to **provoke** the **analyzed**
into a new relationship with their own desires such that they are **no
longer constrained by fantasy**.]{.underline} This point [is reached
when the analyzed traverses the fantasy and arrives at a state of
subjective destitution]{.underline}, where the subject renounces his or
her relationship with a fantasy that prevents "passing to the act" in
relation to desire (Healy Citation2010, p. 502).

Such [re-quilting of fantasy **undermines the hold 'the
thing'**]{.underline} [has as embodying the (impossible) **promise** of
**enjoyment** and displaces it to a different terrain]{.underline}, one
that does not any longer eschew 'the encounter with the Real', i.e.
[those processes and concerns that that have been repressed, disavowed
or foreclosed.]{.underline} It [rejects]{.underline} the Master
[discourse]{.underline} as just another [fantasy]{.underline} and
strives to displace the Master from its pedestal (Žižek Citation2000,
Zupančič Citation2000, Copjec Citation2002). In this section, we [shall
attempt to **encircle parts of the Real** that are repressed through the
lure of certain fantasies]{.underline}, thereby [contributing to
**re**-**orienting** desire around a different 'object-cause of
desire'.]{.underline} Encircling the Real of climate change implies,
among others, the [re-symbolisation of the imaginary upon which the
urgency of environmental action is legitimized and
sustained,]{.underline} while re-articulating the 'thing' around which
desire for a more benign environment in a socially inclusive world
circulates. [The hegemonic base upon which discourse and practice of
both mainstream and more activist climate movement]{.underline}s is
**[predicated rests upon repressed traumas]{.underline}**. Opening-up
different political-ecological trajectories requires transgressing the
fantasy that conceals these traumas.

#### Refuse any demands for solving climate change. It's already happened, and any attempt to fix it is just suturing the void. Only interrogation of the object-cause of desire can break the deadlock.

4.1. The catastrophe has already happened!

First, the [climate emergency portrays a dystopian future if no
appropriate action is taken]{.underline}. This [view]{.underline}
[implies that it is **not too late**,]{.underline} that the [projected
future can still be deflected]{.underline}. However, many [**people**
around the world **already live in the socio-ecological
apocalypse**]{.underline}, [demonstrated by the large numbers of climate
refugees and **mounting socio-ecological problems** experienced by the
**poorest** of the world's population]{.underline} (Parenti
Citation2011). The [climate catastrophe is indeed a combined and
uneven]{.underline} [one]{.underline}, a **[promise for some and a
reality for others]{.underline}** (Calder Williams Citation2011).
[Sustaining]{.underline} catastrophic [imageries]{.underline} are an
[**integral part** of the new cultural politics of
**capitalism**]{.underline} for which the [management of fear is a
central leitmotiv]{.underline} and [provides part of the cultural
support for a process]{.underline} of **[environmental-populist
post-politicization]{.underline}** (Swyngedouw Citation2018). The
[presentation]{.underline} of [climate]{.underline} change as
[potentially catastrophic for all **produces a thoroughly depoliticized
imaginary**]{.underline}, [one that does]{.underline} not identify
adversaries in a political process [or **articulates** with **specific
political programs** of socio-ecological transformations.]{.underline}

[Transgressing this fantasy cuts through this deadlock]{.underline}. The
[revelatory promise of the apocalyptic narrative as well as the
redemptive]{.underline}, but impotent, [insistence on the importance of
behavioural and]{.underline} [**eco-techno-managerial**
change]{.underline} have to be **[rejected fully.]{.underline}** In face
of the dystopian imaginaries mobilized to assure that the apocalypse
will NOT happen at some future moment, [the only reasonable response is
that it is **already too late for many**]{.underline}, that the
[**catastrophe is already here** in the present conditions of planetary
life]{.underline}. Many [humans]{.underline} (and non-humans) [already
live in the post-apocalyptic]{.underline} [interstices]{.underline} of
life, [whereby the fusion of environmental transformation]{.underline}
and social conditions, [renders]{.underline} **[life
bare]{.underline}**. There is **[no Arcadian place,]{.underline}**
[time, or environment to return to, no benign socio-ecological
past]{.underline} or an [**ideal climate** that needs to be
**reconstructed or maintained**]{.underline}. It is only within the
realization of the [apocalyptic reality of the now that a **new
politics** might emerge]{.underline}. [Directing the
environmental]{.underline} [gaze]{.underline} [to the perspective of
those who are already **barely surviving**]{.underline} within the
collapse of the socio-ecological conditions [opens a wide range of new
ways of **addressing socio-ecological** **realities**]{.underline} and
[inaugurates a **vast terrain** of different political and
**socio-technical interventions** other than]{.underline} the presently
[dominant ones.]{.underline}

4.2. 'Humanity' cannot be saved

Second, the [consensual climate discourse insists on the imminent danger
climate change poses to the future of humanity]{.underline}.
[Humanity]{.underline} in this context is **[not just the sum total of
humans living]{.underline}** on Earth but [understood as human
civilization,]{.underline} characterised by a [range of
shared]{.underline} [beliefs]{.underline}, [ethics]{.underline}, and
[principles]{.underline} (such as liberty, solidarity, equality, and
civic rights). As Maurice Blanchot argued[, such view is]{.underline}
[predicated upon the **fantasy that 'humanity' actually
exists,**]{.underline} that there is [a global human
civilization]{.underline}, [one that deserves salvation]{.underline}.
However, the [Real of the human presence on Earth of course exposes the
**empty core of 'humanity'**]{.underline} (Blanchot Citation1971). The
[multiple tensions and conflicts]{.underline}, and the unspeakable
[violence]{.underline} [inflected by humans on humans testify to this
'**emptiness'**,]{.underline} despite occasional manifestations of a
deep humanity shared by some.

It is precisely this emptiness that is denied; it is a [repressed
trauma,]{.underline} [namely the disavowed]{.underline} [knowledge that
there is **no** **such thing as 'humanity'**]{.underline}. The
[pervasive inequalities]{.underline}, the [rampant]{.underline}
[uneven]{.underline} power [relations]{.underline}, the [incessant
dispossession]{.underline} of some people of their livelihoods, the
[continuous]{.underline} [objective and subjective violence]{.underline}
inflicted by some humans onto other humans are symptoms of the
[radical]{.underline} antagonisms and [conflicts]{.underline} that [cut
through the human collective and signal]{.underline} that a
**[communitarian 'humanity' has never existed]{.underline}**. It [may
never do unless a **sustained political fidelity** to]{.underline} [the
**possibility**, if not necessity, of its **making is
inaugurated**]{.underline}. The [disavowal]{.underline} in the [climate
discourse of]{.underline} the [barbarism that also characterizes
humanity is a classic form of traumatic repression]{.underline}.
According to Blanchot, the [fundamental challenge is the choice between
an **apocalyptic future**]{.underline} that speeds ahead precisely
because of the [absence of 'humanity' or the actual construction of a
'humanity' now that, in turn,]{.underline} would deflect the course of
the future in a more benign direction (Blanchot Citation1971, Zupančič
Citation2018). [The issue is, therefore, **not to assure the future of a
non-existing humanity as** **we know** it, but first and foremost the
**creation of a humanity.**]{.underline}

#### Coming to terms with extinction as an occurring process and that there is no "humanity" is critical to mobilizing sufficient action, political or not. Their scenario planning good evidence doesn't matter -- we internal link turn.

Conclusion: 'The people' do not exist

This paper focused on the parallels between populism and a range of
environmental discourses and practices. Of course, there are significant
social movements and intellectual endeavours that cut through the
fantasies that underlie much of climate action. The slogan 'system
change not climate change' captures much of this and is part of a
widening scholarly and activist agenda (see, for example, Malm
Citation2018, Citation2021, Empson Citation2019, Kapoor Citation2020,
Beer Citation2020, Felli Citation2021). The focus of this contribution
was primarily on the phantasmic structures that sustain the dominant
discourse and practices, the parallels between populism and significant
parts of the environmental movement, on the lure that binds many people
to sustaining the status quo despite the precarity of the situation, and
on the subconscious mechanism that produce barriers to embracing a
politics articulated around system change.

Indeed, a [significant post-truth imaginary seeps into the dominant
climate discourse]{.underline}, a **[phantasmagoria]{.underline}** of an
[abstract and virtual]{.underline}, but nonetheless [threatened, global
humanity]{.underline}. In doing so, the [Real of class, capital, and
other antagonisms that **cut through the semblance of humanity** is
considered irrelevant or at least subordinate]{.underline}. [The
fetishistic repression, disavowal, or foreclosure of these
antagonisms]{.underline} that [form]{.underline} the [matrix of the
social assures]{.underline} that **[nothing will really
change]{.underline}**. [Traversing]{.underline} the [present
fantasy]{.underline} of a [just climate transition through
techno-managerial]{.underline} and (neo)[liberal]{.underline}
[consumerist adjustments]{.underline} requires **[recognizing the
trauma]{.underline}** of the [non-existence of humanity]{.underline} and
that it is this [non-existence that has already **caused the climate
catastrophe**]{.underline}. [Traversing this fantasy is]{.underline}
[predicated upon reversing the dominant argument: **recognizing that is
already too late**]{.underline} -- the [apocalypse has already
happened]{.underline} -- and the [only possible thing left to do is to
**engage in a process of** **constructing a real
'humanity'**]{.underline}, of [producing a human world in the
world.]{.underline} This necessitates **[foregrounding radical
politicization]{.underline}**. Or in other words, if we really want to
take the ecological condition seriously, [we have to displace the
question of ecology from a populist frame onto the terrain of agonistic
politicization,]{.underline} animated by a sustained fidelity to what
Alain Badiou calls a passion for the real possibility and necessity of
an egalitarian common world. It is through such political project that a
common and enabling climate might be constituted[. First and foremost,
we have to insist that **there is no alternative.**]{.underline}

[[Decision making]{.mark} often [occurs without people giving]{.mark}
much **[conscious thought]{.mark}** to how they vote, what they buy,
where they go on vacation or the way [they negotiate a myriad]{.mark} of
other [life]{.mark} choices.]{.underline}

[[**Unconscious**]{.mark} processes [underlie]{.mark} the [way
we]{.mark} deliberate and plan our [live]{.mark}s---and for good reason.
Automatic judgments, for one, are essential for dodging an oncoming car
or bus.]{.underline}

Behaviors governed by the unconscious go beyond looking both ways at the
corner. Embedded attitudes below the level of awareness shape many of
our attitudes toward others.

Sigmund Freud meditated on the meaning of the unconscious throughout his
career. These newer studies provide a more pragmatic perspective on how
we relate to a boss or spouse.

[When [psychologists]{.mark} try to understand the way our mind works,
they frequently come to a [conclusion]{.mark} that may seem startling:
[people]{.mark} often [make decisions without]{.mark} having given them
much [thought]{.mark}---or, more precisely, [before]{.mark} they have
[thought]{.mark} about them [consciously]{.mark}. When we decide how to
vote, what to buy, where to go on vacation and myriad other things,
unconscious thoughts that we are not even aware of typically play a big
role. [Research]{.mark} has [recently]{.mark} brought to light just how
[profoundly]{.mark} our [unconscious mind shapes]{.mark} our
[day-to-day]{.mark} interactions.]{.underline}

[One of the best-known studies to illustrate the power of the
unconscious focused on the process of deciding whether a candidate was
fit to hold public office.]{.underline} A group of mock voters were
given a split second to inspect portrait photographs from the Internet
of U.S. gubernatorial and senatorial candidates from states other than
where the voters lived. [Then, based on their fleeting glimpses of each
portrait, they were asked to judge the candidates.]{.underline}
Remarkably, the straw poll served as an accurate proxy for the later
choices of actual voters in those states. [Competency ratings based on
seeing the candidates\' faces for less time than it takes to blink an
eye predicted the outcome of two out of three elections.]{.underline}

For more than 100 years the role of unconscious influences on our
thoughts and actions has preoccupied scientists who study the mind.
Sigmund Freud\'s massive body of work emphasized the conscious as the
locus of rational thought and emotion and the unconscious as the lair of
the irrational, but contemporary cognitive psychologists have recast the
Freudian worldview into a less polarized psychological dynamic. Both
types of thought processes, it turns out, help us adapt to the protean
demands of a species that survives by marshaling the mental firepower to
hunt a Stone Age mastodon, face off in a Middle Ages joust or, in the
new millennium, sell Apple\'s stock short.

Post-Freudian psychology has set aside the id and ego for a more
pragmatic take on what defines our unconscious self. Nobel laureate
Daniel Kahneman has described the modern distinction between the
automatic and the controlled. In his best-selling book Thinking Fast and
Slow, Kahneman characterized automatic thought processes as fast,
efficient and typically outside the realm of conscious awareness, making
them devoid of deliberation or planning. They require only a simple
stimulus: the words on this page, for instance, connect effortlessly in
your mind with their meaning. Controlled processes are the opposite.
They require purposeful and relatively slow engagement of conscious
thought---picture the labored effort that goes into doing your tax
returns.

[Similar to [Freud\'s]{.mark} primal **[id]{.mark}** and controlling
**[ego]{.mark}**, the [automatic]{.mark} and [controlled systems]{.mark}
complement each other yet also, [at times, conflict]{.mark}. You need to
react without reflection to dodge an oncoming bus but also need to check
yourself from throwing a punch at the reckless bus driver.]{.underline}

Snap judgments---relatively automatic thought processes---abound in our
daily life---and for good reason. [[Outside]{.mark} of the relatively
[small number of individuals]{.mark} any one of us knows really well,
most people [we interact]{.mark} with are strangers we might never see
again---while standing in line at the bank, say---or others we come
across in the course of their jobs---cashiers, taxi drivers, waiters,
insurance agents, teachers, and so on. The [**default** **unconscious
perception** generates expectations]{.mark} about behavior and
personalities based on minimal information.]{.underline} We expect
waitresses to act a certain way, which is different from what we expect
of librarians or truck drivers. These expectations come to us
immediately and without our thinking about them, based only on a
person\'s social place.

[The [**unconscious** way we perceive people]{.mark} during the course
of the day is a **[reflexive reaction]{.mark}**. [We]{.mark} [must exert
willful, conscious effort]{.mark} to put aside the unexplained and
sometimes unwarranted negative feelings that we may harbor toward
others. [The stronger the unconscious influence]{.mark}, the
[harder]{.mark} [we]{.mark} have to [work]{.mark} consciously to
[overcome]{.mark} it.]{.underline} In particular, this holds true for
habitual behaviors. An alcoholic might come home in the evening and pour
a drink; a person with a weight problem might reach for the potato
chips---both easily casting aside the countervailing urge toward
restraint.

[[Understanding]{.mark} the [tug]{.mark} the [unconscious]{.mark} exerts
on us is [essential]{.mark} so that we do not become overwhelmed by
[impulses]{.mark} that are [hard to]{.mark} understand and
[control]{.mark}.]{.underline} The ability to regulate our own
behavior---whether making friends, getting up to speed at a new job or
overcoming a drinking problem---depends on more than genes, temperament
and social support networks. It also hinges, in no small measure, on our
capacity to identify and try to overcome the automatic impulses and
emotions that influence every aspect of our waking life. [[To make our
way in the world, **we need to learn to come to terms with our
unconscious self.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Substantial empirical support for psychoanalytic theory. It's just rebranded now.

Mark Leonard **Solms** 12-3-20**18**. Mark Solms is a South African
psychoanalyst and neuropsychologist, who is known for his discovery of
the brain mechanisms of dreaming. \" The Neurobiological Underpinnings

My third and final argument is that **[psychoanalytic
therapy]{.underline}** achieves **[good outcomes]{.underline}**---at
[least as good as, and in some respects better than, other
evidence-based treatments in psychiatry today]{.underline} (see Shedler,
2015). This argument unfolds over four stages:

\(a\) [Psychotherapy]{.underline} in general is a [**highly effective**
form of treatment]{.underline}. **[Meta-analyses]{.underline}** of
[psychotherapy]{.underline} outcome studies typically
[reveal]{.underline} [effect]{.underline} sizes of between
**[0.73]{.underline}** and **[0.85]{.underline}**. (An effect size of
1.0 means that the average treated patient is one standard deviation
healthier than the average untreated patient). An [effect size of 0.8 is
considered a large effect]{.underline} in psychiatric research, 0[.5 is
considered moderate]{.underline}, and 0.2 is considered small. To put
the [efficacy of psychotherapy into perspective]{.underline}, recent
antidepressant medications achieve effect sizes of between 0.24
(tricyclics) and 0.31 (SSRIs).24 The [changes]{.underline}
[brought]{.underline} [about by psychotherapy]{.underline}, no less than
drug therapy, are of course [visualizable with brain
imaging]{.underline} (see Beauregard, 2014).

\(b\) **[Psychoanalytic psychotherapy]{.underline}** is **[equally
effective]{.underline}** as [other forms of psychotherapy]{.underline}
(e.g., **[CBT]{.underline}**). This has recently been
[demonstrated]{.underline} conclusively by **[comparative
meta-analysis]{.underline}** (Steinert et al., 2017). However, there is
[evidence to suggest that the effects last longer]{.underline}---and
even **[increase]{.underline}**---[after]{.underline} the end of the
[treatment]{.underline}. (Shedler, 2010) [**authoritative review** of
all randomized control trials]{.underline} to date reported [effect
sizes of between **0.78 and 1.46,**]{.underline} even for diluted and
truncated forms of psychoanalytic therapy.25 An especially
[methodologically rigorous meta-analysis]{.underline} (Abbass et al.,
2006) [yielded]{.underline} an [overall effect size of 0.97
for]{.underline} [general symptom improvement with **psychoanalytic
therapy**]{.underline}. The effect size increased to 1.51 when the
patients were assessed at follow-up. A [more recent
meta-analysis]{.underline} by Abbass et al. (2014) [yielded an overall
effect size of 0.71 and the finding of maintained and increased effects
at follow-up was **reconfirmed**.]{.underline}

This was for [short-term psychoanalytic treatment]{.underline}.
According to the meta-analysis of de Maat et al. (2009), which was less
methodologically rigorous than the Abbass studies, [longer-term
psychoanalytic]{.underline} [psychotherapy yields an effect size of 0.78
at termination and 0.94 at follow-up,]{.underline} and
**[psychoanalysis]{.underline}** **[proper]{.underline}** achieves a
mean [effect size of **0.87 at termination**]{.underline} and **[1.18 at
follow-up]{.underline}**. This is the [overall]{.underline}
[effect]{.underline}; the effect size that she found for symptom
improvement (as opposed to personality change) at termination was 1.03
for long-term therapy, and for **[psychoanalysis it was
1.38.]{.underline}** A [subsequent study]{.underline} by
Leuzinger-Bohleber et al. (2018, in press) [shows even bigger effect
sizes:]{.underline} between [1.62 and 1.89]{.underline} after 3 years of
treatment. These are **[enormous effects]{.underline}**. Follow-up data
are of course not yet available from this ongoing study. The [consistent
trend toward larger effect sizes at follow-u]{.underline}p (where the
effects of other forms of psychotherapy, like CBT, tend to decay)
[suggests that **psychoanalytic therapy** sets in motion processes of
change that **continue even after therapy has ended**]{.underline} (cf.
"working through," discussed above). This is called the **["sleeper
effect."]{.underline}**

It is important to recognize that these findings concern symptom
improvement only. Psychoanalytic treatments are not directed primarily
at symptomatic relief but rather at what might be called personality
change. [Not surprisingly, therefore, psychoanalytic treatments achieve
much better results than other treatments on this outcome
measure]{.underline}. In Leuzinger et al.\'s ongoing study, for example,
[almost **twice as many patients** receiving psychoanalytic treatment
vs. CBT reached their criteria for "structural change"]{.underline}
after 3 years (60 vs. 36%).

\(c\) The [therapeutic techniques]{.underline} that
[predict]{.underline} best treatment [outcomes]{.underline} make [good
sense]{.underline} in relation to the [psychodynamic
mechanisms]{.underline} outlined above. These techniques are (Blagys and
Hilsenroth, 2000):

• unstructured, open-ended dialogue between patient and therapist.

• identifying recurring themes in the patient\'s experience.

• linking the patient\'s feelings and perceptions to past experiences.

• drawing attention to feelings regarded by the patient as unacceptable.

• pointing out ways in which the patient avoids feelings.

• focusing on the here-and-now therapy relationship.

• drawing connections between the therapy relationship and other
relationships.

It is highly instructive to note that these [techniques lead to the best
treatment outcomes]{.underline}, [regardless]{.underline} of the
**["brand"]{.underline}** of therapy the clinician espouses. In other
words, [these same techniques]{.underline} (or at least a subset of
them; see Hayes et al., 1996) [**predict** optimal treatment **outcomes
in CBT too**, even if the therapist believes they are doing something
else.]{.underline}

\(d\) It is therefore perhaps [not surprising that
psychotherapists]{.underline}, irrespective of their stated theoretical
orientation, [tend to choose psychoanalytic psychotherapy for
themselves]{.underline} (Norcross, 2005)!

#### The unconscious drive automates action before thought. 

Mark Leonard **Solms** 12-3-20**18**. Mark Solms is a South African
psychoanalyst and neuropsychologist, who is known for his discovery of
the brain mechanisms of dreaming. \" The Neurobiological Underpinnings
of Psychoanalytic Theory and Therapy,\" Frontiers, Front. Behav.
Neurosci., Sec. Pathological Conditions, Volume 12,
https://doi.org/10.3389/fnbeh.2018.00294.

Most of our [predictions are executed **unconsciously**]{.underline}. As
we saw above, [cognitive consciousness]{.underline} (short-term "working
memory") is an [extremely limited resource]{.underline}, so there is
[enormous pressure to consolidate]{.underline} our [solutions to life\'s
problems]{.underline} into long-term memory, and then [ultimately to
**automatize** them. **Innate**]{.underline}
**[predictions]{.underline}**---of the kind discussed above18--are
**[effected automatically from the outset]{.underline}**, as are those
acquired in the first 2--3 years of life, before the preconscious
("declarative") memory systems mature (cf. infantile amnesia, which
applies only to episodic and semantic memory). [Multiple
unconscious]{.underline} (non-declarative) [memory systems]{.underline}
[exist]{.underline}, but the ones that are [most relevant to
psychopathology]{.underline} are "[procedural" and "emotional"
memory]{.underline}, which operate according to different rules. These
[stereotyped]{.underline} systems [bypass thinking]{.underline} (cf.
Freud\'s **["repetition compulsion")]{.underline}** and
[define]{.underline} the mode of [functioning of the system
unconscious]{.underline} (see below).

The [ultimate aim of learning is to permanently solve our
problems]{.underline} (i.e., to learn how to meet our needs in the world
reliably). To the extent that this goal is achieved, [preconscious
predictions]{.underline} are [iteratively]{.underline}
[consolidated]{.underline} and **[reconsolidated ever more
deeply]{.underline}**. The [consolidation]{.underline} of such
[automatized predictions]{.underline} centrally [involves]{.underline}
[transferring]{.underline} them from [cortical to subcortical memory
systems]{.underline} (principally but not exclusively located in the
basal ganglia and cerebellum). The crucial thing to note about these
latter systems is that they [entail non-representational]{.underline}
(sometimes called "model free") [action programmes.]{.underline} Here I
am using the term "representation" in the sense in which I used it
above---namely to refer to images. That is why non-declarative memories
simply cannot be retrieved into working memory; they are non-thinkable
executive programmes.

[All]{.underline} of this [implies]{.underline} that [truly
unconscious]{.underline} (as opposed to preconscious)
[memories]{.underline} are [**not subject to updating** in working
memory.]{.underline} This is of crucial importance. They are,
[therefore]{.underline}, in a [sense, **indelible** (LeDoux, 1995). But
they are also highly **efficient**.]{.underline} LeDoux (1995) calls
them "quick and dirty." This is the neural basis of what Freud (1911)
called [the "primary process."]{.underline} Via these circuits,
[stimulus X simply triggers]{.underline} [response Y,]{.underline} with
nothing in between (no delay, no thinking, no "secondary process").19

This does not mean that non-declarative memories are not subject to
reconsolidation. What it means is that they are not subject to
reconsolidation via thinking (via conscious cognition, via working
memory); they are only subject to reconsolidation through action.
Non[-declarative memories can only be activated (and
thereby]{.underline} consolidated/reconsolidated) [through **embodied
enactment**.]{.underline}

Of course, not all automatized memories start out as declarative
memories. The [multiple memory systems]{.underline} [operate both
successively and simultaneously]{.underline}. Some (especially emotional
memories, which arise from purely subcortical associations) are
therefore automatized from the outset. This [applies]{.underline} also
to [innate]{.underline} emotional [predictions]{.underline}. (Instinct
is just another word for innate predictions). Instinctual executive
programmes are all subcortical. But---as we have seen above---they need
to be supplemented by learning. [Fear conditioning is an excellent
example.]{.underline} Here we speak of "single-exposure learning;" e.g.,
we cannot afford to learn twice what happens when we stick our fingers
into an electrical socket.

Learning in each of the different instinctual-emotional systems follows
somewhat different rules. For example, early sexual experiences, as with
fear conditioning, appear to entail single-exposure learning and to
leave indelible impressions. Attachment bonds, by contrast, are
established slowly during the first 6 months of life, but they become
extremely difficult to change after that (cf. the difference between
acute "protest" and chronic "despair" with experiences of separation and
loss).

[Procedural memories]{.underline}, similarly, are "[hard to learn and
hard to forget."]{.underline} What these two non-declarative memory
systems have in common is that they by-pass thinking. But this does not
mean that they by-pass affective consciousness. [Just because we cannot
"declare" our automatized predictions does not mean we cannot feel their
causes and their consequences]{.underline}. (The conflation of
consciousness with conscious cognition---i.e., excluding affect---has
often led cognitive science astray).

Now we come to the heart of the matter. I have [localized **Freud\'s**
system "**preconscious**"]{.underline} in the cortex and his system
"[unconscious]{.underline}" in the [non-declarative memory
systems]{.underline} located beneath the cortex, primarily in the basal
ganglia, and cerebellum (Solms, 2017b). But the [unconscious memory
systems I have just]{.underline} [described]{.underline} are
[conventionally called "the cognitive unconscious]{.underline}," which
is contrasted with "the dynamic unconscious."
[Psychoanalysts]{.underline} [acknowledge]{.underline} the existence of
a [cognitive unconscious]{.underline} (they call it the "unconscious
ego") but they [point out]{.underline} that it [excludes the dynamic
processes]{.underline} that [Freud discovered]{.underline} (which they
call the "**[repressed]{.underline}**").

Freud thought the repressed unconscious was part of the id. This was one
of his biggest mistakes, as I discussed above. [I do not mean that the
repressed unconscious does not exist.]{.underline} I mean only that [the
system **unconscious** and the **id** are **two different things**,
located in **two different parts of the brain.**]{.underline}

The [repressed]{.underline} is [derived from cognitive
(representational) processes]{.underline}, from learning, whereas the
[id]{.underline} consists in **[affective]{.underline}**
(non-representational) **[processes]{.underline}**, and it is
[innate]{.underline}. The [parts of the brain that perform]{.underline}
the [functions]{.underline} which Freud called "id" are [located mainly
in the upper brainstem and limbic system]{.underline}; whereas the
[parts]{.underline} that perform the functions he attributed to "the
[repressed]{.underline}" (or the "system unconscious") are located
[mainly]{.underline} in the **[basal ganglia and
cerebellum]{.underline}** (There are, of course, multiple interactions
between these systems. For example: the amygdala and nucleus accumbens
straddle the tail and head of the caudate nucleus, respectively; and the
basal ganglia, in turn, interact constantly with the prefrontal lobes).

In my opinion the [difference between the cognitive and the dynamic
unconscious is simply this]{.underline}. The [cognitive]{.underline}
[unconscious]{.underline} consists in predictions that are
**[legitimately automatized]{.underline}**. That is, they are deeply
automatized because they work so well; they reliably meet the underlying
needs that they are aimed at. The **[repressed]{.underline}**, by
contrast, is **[illegitimately]{.underline}** (or prematurely)
**[automatized]{.underline}**. Illegitimate automatization [occurs when
the ego is overwhelmed by its problems]{.underline}; that is, [**when it
cannot** work out how to **satisfy id** **demands** in the world. This
happens a lot in childhood, when the ego is feeble.]{.underline}

The infamous Oedipus complex provides an excellent example of an
insoluble problem: it is an almost-inevitable constellation of
compulsive (innate) emotional needs, arising simultaneously, which are
beyond the reach of the child, and irreconcilable with each other.
("Conflict" is just another word for "insoluble problem"). In such
situations, the child has no other choice but to cut its losses. It is
doomed either (1) to obsess endlessly over a problem that it cannot
solve, thereby wasting precious working memory resources which could be
more usefully deployed for problems that it can solve---such as how to
read, write, and calculate---or (2) to make the best of a bad job and
automatize the least-bad childish prediction it can come up with, even
though it does not work so well.20

**[Repression]{.underline}** (through the adjustment of precision
weighting) has the [inevitable]{.underline} [implication]{.underline}
that a deeply [automatized prediction]{.underline} does not manage the
feelings it is aimed at, but [there is nothing the subject can
do]{.underline} [about this]{.underline}; since the [essence of
repression]{.underline} [consists]{.underline} in the fact that the
[prediction is treated]{.underline} as if it does work well, and it is
**[therefore immune to reconsolidation]{.underline}**.21 The [resultant
prediction error]{.underline} is the [constant]{.underline}
[pressure]{.underline} that Freud theorized as the threat of "the return
of the repressed" (This, in turn, leads to secondary defenses---i.e., to
what Freud called "after-pressure").

Where I differ from Freud in this regard is that I do not believe the
repressed ever returns; it is only the affect (which it fails to
regulate) that returns. How many patients actually remember their
Oedipal strivings, even in psychoanalysis, for example? [This is because
non-declarative memories are just that: non-declarative.]{.underline}
Non-declarative memories are **[purely associative]{.underline}** (and
permanently unconscious) action tendencies of the kind described by
LeDoux, as with Pavlov\'s dogs. No thinking occurs, not even implicitly.
This has major implications for how psychoanalytic treatment works.

Before moving on to that topic (of how this type of treatment works), I
want to restate the concluding point of this section, because it is of
utmost importance: [Not only successful predictions are
automatized.]{.underline} With this simple observation, we have overcome
the unfortunate distinction between the "cognitive" and "dynamic"
unconscious. Sometimes a child has to make the best of a bad job in
order to focus on the problems that it can solve. Such
[illegitimately]{.underline} or [prematurely automatized
predictions]{.underline} (i.e., wishes as opposed to realistic
solutions) are **[called "the repressed."]{.underline}** Normally, in
order for predictions to be updated in light of experience, they need to
be reconsolidated; that is, they need to enter consciousness again, in
order for the long-term traces to become labile once more. [This is
impossible to achieve for repressed predictions, because the essential
mechanism of repression entails immunity from (declarative)
reconsolidation, despite prediction errors.]{.underline}

\"Beyond Clinical Case Studies in Psychoanalysis: A Review of
Psychoanalytic Empirical Single Case Studies Published in ISI-Ranked
Journals,\" Front. Psychol., Sec. Psychoanalysis and
Neuropsychoanalysis, Volume 8, https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01749.

[Mapping]{.underline} [**psychoanalytic empirical case studies**
published]{.underline} in **[ISI-ranked journals]{.underline}**
[showed]{.underline} that they, while still remaining scarce, [clearly
increased in quantity and quality throughout the last
decennia.]{.underline} The [increase]{.underline} in
[quality]{.underline} is shown in the [results of our
review]{.underline} that [indicate]{.underline} a larger amount of
information provided in more recent studies, a [broader use of different
sources of data and analysis methods]{.underline}, and more explicit
informed consent considerations. However, also when reading the articles
to rate the IBISC, it was clear that generally there is more attention
for a detailed description of the study, its methods, the patient and
his or her therapeutic process. Especially, in the last decennium a
[remarkable]{.underline} [increase]{.underline} could be seen in the
am[ount of published cases and the systematic nature of these cases that
increasingly include multiple sources of data and combine different
methods of analysis.]{.underline} These include both instruments and
methods developed within the field of psychoanalysis \[e.g., the Core
Conflictual Relationship Theme method (Luborsky and Crits-Christoph,
1998) or Reflective Functioning ratings (Bucci, 1997)\] and [more
generic methods that allow the connection to broader psychological
research]{.underline} (e.g., the Beck Depression Inventory; Beck et al.,
1996).

When considering [systematic case studies in the broader field of
psychoanalytic case studies]{.underline} -- which remain to be mainly
**[clinical case studies]{.underline}** -- it is [clear that they
provide much more descriptive]{.underline} [information than clinical
case studies]{.underline}, which mostly pay little attention to giving
comprehensive descriptive information, despite the rich clinical
description they provide (Desmet et al., 2013). Nevertheless,
information about certain topics remains generally absent. Especially a
description of the therapist is often omitted, which might however, be
important contextual information if one intends to compare or aggregate
different cases. As the role of the therapist in explaining outcome is
increasingly recognized (e.g., Kraus et al., 2011) and because of the
inherently interactive nature of the therapeutic encounter (e.g.,
Strupp, 2008), its importance can hardly be overestimated.

The [range of diagnoses, short- and long-term therapies, and successful
and unsuccessful cases investigated in empirical case
studies]{.underline}, however, provide a **[myriad of possibilities for
meta-studies.]{.underline}** Moreover, while we noticed a [wide array of
methods, there also are trends and recurring methods]{.underline}
[indicating that meta-studies are feasible.]{.underline} For example,
methods [like Reflective Functioning]{.underline} or the SWAP-200 are
used in different studies and [should allow for good quality
meta-studies.]{.underline} On the other hand, we noticed that studies
focusing on purely quantitative methods often omit a clinical
description of the patient and the therapy process. In our opinion, this
is throwing away the baby with the bathwater. While critiques on the
anecdotal nature of clinical case studies may be apt, discarding a
clinical or qualitative description altogether is to disown the essence
and the strength of the psychoanalytic single case study. [Moreover,
with respect to clinical relevance and to possible meta-studies, this
**clinical contextual information is quintessential.**]{.underline}

Concerning [ethical considerations]{.underline} of research in such
[delicate circumstances as the psychotherapeutic]{.underline} setting,
it [appears that even more attention could be paid to informed
consent.]{.underline} While informed consent was mentioned much more
than was found in the overall archive (Desmet et al., 2013) -- where it
was mentioned in only 9% of cases -- still more than half of the studies
did not provide information about informed consent despite their
explicit research context.

Surely, our review has certain limitations. Using other search criteria
for example, might result in other cases and probably more empirical
psychoanalytic cases exist. Also, the inclusion of cases published in
books might be a valuable addition. [Nevertheless, we think a
**representative and large** **sample** of systematic case studies could
be retrieved through this method]{.underline}. If this is the case,
surely future research should aim to investigate age groups that are
currently underrepresented in the field as most case studies focus on
(young) adults.

We [conclude that psychoanalytic **empirical case**
**studies**]{.underline}, although they [were adopted
somewhat]{.underline} later than in [other orientations]{.underline},
are of **[increasing and]{.underline}** **[high]{.underline}**
**[quality]{.underline}**. Moreover, [journals currently provide
more]{.underline} [clear guidelines]{.underline} as to what comprises an
eligible case study. [High quality cases, for example **Gazillo**
et]{.underline} al. (2014), **[Mauck and Moore]{.underline}** (2014) and
**[Cornelis]{.underline}** et al. (2017), set [the tone for a future
where]{.underline} case [aggregation based on scientifically sound cases
that include triangulated data and analysis methods while not
disregarding clinical context becomes increasingly
possible]{.underline}. This attention for the clinical context is of
crucial importance in the field of psychotherapy (Spence, 2001).
Psychotherapy is and always will consist of a unique encounter between
patient and therapist, a complex interaction that cannot be easily
disentangled (Strupp, 2008). [While systematically investigating what
happens in this process is crucial for the advancement of the
psychotherapeutic endeavor, this should not come at the cost of the
clinical richness of these ever-singular encounters that comprise the
magic of the psychotherapeutic profession.]{.underline}

[**Layer 5 pyramidal neurons** densely express 5**-HT2A
receptors**]{.underline} (Weber and Andrade, 2010). These
[cells]{.underline} are an [important target of
psychedelics]{.underline} (Aghajanian and Marek, 1997) and are [known to
fire with an]{.underline} intrinsic **[alpha frequency]{.underline}**
(Silva et al., 1991; Sun and Dan, 2009). [Alpha oscillations are
thought]{.underline} to be related to [temporal framing in **perceptual
processing**]{.underline} (Lorincz et al., 2009; Klimesch et al., 2011)
but more [intriguingly given the focus of the present
article]{.underline}, a [positive relationship has been found between
self-reflection and alpha power]{.underline} (Knyazev et al., 2011) and
**[alpha synchronization]{.underline}** during rest and Blood Oxygen
Level Dependent (BOLD) [activity in regions of the DMN
(]{.underline}Jann et al., 2009). Evidence [implicates]{.underline} the
[**DMN** in **self-reflective** and **introspective

[phase]{.underline} of [fluctuating]{.underline} activity in the DMN is
[often inversely correlated (or "anticorrelated") with fluctuating
activity in networks concerned with task-focused attention]{.underline}
(task-positive networks, TPNs) (Fox et al., 2005). Like the
[DMN]{.underline}, alpha oscillations [mature developmentally and
evolutionarily]{.underline} (Basar and Guntekin, 2009), tempting
speculations that these rhythms have developed to reduce "entropy"
\[i.e., disorder or uncertainty (Ben-Naim, 2008)\] by increasing mutual
information among neuronal ensembles (Tononi et al., 1994; Basar and
Guntekin, 2009). With this in mind, it was [remarkable]{.underline} that
we [recently found a highly significant positive
correlation]{.underline} between the [magnitude of alpha
power]{.underline} [decreases]{.underline} in the [PCC after psilocybin
and ratings of the **item "I experienced a disintegration of my 'self'
or 'ego'**]{.underline}." [Scores]{.underline} on this item also
[correlated positively with decreases in delta, theta, beta,
and]{.underline} low [gamma power,]{.underline} although [alpha
explained the most variance]{.underline} (a considerable 66%) see Figure
4. Twenty three subjective items were rated after psilocybin but the one
enquiring about ego-disintegration showed the closest relationship with
the [decreases in alpha power]{.underline}, [surviving the conservative
Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons]{.underline}.

**hold** on reality (**DMN control** on MTL activity)]{.underline}

5\. Towards a [**real enjoyment** of climate change]{.underline}

So far, we engaged with enjoyment as a political factor that sustains
the 'deadlock' of the climate situation today. [Enjoyment]{.underline}
is structured both by transgression and excess, [animated by an
incessant]{.underline} [quest for full satisfaction, to become whole or
One]{.underline} [again]{.underline}, and this [operates both at the
level of **subject** **and society.**]{.underline} We argued [that
enjoyment emanates from the **lack**]{.underline} [in
being]{.underline}, from the void or gap that defines the subject, and
that [enjoyment is **bound to fail** serially]{.underline}, yet it is
what the subject compulsively clings to. The impossibility of attaining
the 'Thing' that [initiates enjoyment renders the]{.underline} [drive to
enjoyment intrinsically **painful**]{.underline}, **[repetitive, and
ultimately politically impotent]{.underline}**. The empty core (the
Thing) of enjoyment, in turn, circulates around a little 'thing', the
object a, that becomes the placeholder for enjoyment, and that
structures our everyday life, its dreams, aspirations, and actions, but
always fails to fulfil its phantasmic promises.

[Traversing the fantasy]{.underline} that [sustains such phantasmic
attachment]{.underline} to a [wholesome earth and climate]{.underline},
articulated around and [achieved through **managing greenhouse
gases**]{.underline} requires a re-articulation of enjoyment in a way
that contrasts with the very symptoms produced by its pursuit. [It means
moving from foregrounding the antinomies and **infernal repetitive
failures** that continuously]{.underline} [undermine **full
enjoyment**]{.underline}, holding the subject in the iron grip of
repetition without issue -- but nonetheless securing the stronghold of
the social order -- [to recognizing precisely the **lack** that defines
the subject (and the Other).]{.underline} In other words, the '[**lack
in being'** needs full endorsement]{.underline} (Pohl, 2020). This
basically [means abolishing the superego\'s injunction to **enjoy
climate change**]{.underline} without sacrificing oneself for 'the
rights of Nature'. [Other than the climate fantasies identified above
that]{.underline} [basically evoke a symptom of the **repetitive failure
to enjoy**]{.underline}, caused by [an Other who is
imagined]{.underline} [standing in the way of ultimate]{.underline}, yet
impossible, enjoyment, [a recognition that the failure to enjoy
is]{.underline} [constitutive to the subject]{.underline} (and not
external) [potentially **opens a terrain** for a **truly political**
**enjoyment** of climate change.]{.underline} This implies
[reframing]{.underline} enjoyment [away]{.underline} [from]{.underline}
'[sacrificing]{.underline} in the name of Nature', '[passionately
destroying Nature',]{.underline} or fetishistically [displacing the
issue to a question of greenhouse gases]{.underline}. Such **[traversing
the fantasy]{.underline}** [entails]{.underline} a process of
**["subjective destitution]{.underline}**" (Žižek, 2022), a condition
whereby the attachment to object a (greenhouse gases) as the 'thing'
around which salvation revolves is radically abandoned (and with it, the
passionate attachment to the world as we know it) to make place for
recognizing the constitutive emptiness or loss at the core of being.
This involves a process of mourning [and melancholia]{.underline}
(Fletcher, 2018), a [recognition of irretrievable]{.underline} [absence
for which there is no substitute replacement (]{.underline}to be
**[found in a 'better' climate]{.underline}**). It is through this
**[subjective destitution]{.underline}** -- [the loss of embracing a
'lost' nature or climate through managing]{.underline} [greenhouse
gases]{.underline} as harbinger for a '[better' or **more just
society**]{.underline} -- as a [process whereby one]{.underline} loses
[oneself in **renouncing the fantasmic nature** through which life
secures a fragile sense of coherence]{.underline} [that a **new path
might open toward** a **Real** **enjoyment** of climate
change]{.underline}. The realization of the [absence of a
stable]{.underline} core at the heart of the climate situation [forces
one to consider the possibility of a Real enjoyment of climate
change.]{.underline}

As McGowan emphasizes:

[**Real** enjoyment occurs when the **subject abandons the security** of
its symbolic identity]{.underline} and thereby [breaks from the
constraints of the symbolic order]{.underline}. In this enjoyment, the
[**rules of the symbolic game** **cease to apply**]{.underline}. The
[subject neither obeys nor disobeys]{.underline} ... Thus,
[enjoyment]{.underline} in the [Real]{.underline} is a
[radical]{.underline} experience, but at the same time it is
[necessarily traumatic]{.underline} because it leaves the subject
without any ground on which to stand. ... [Real enjoyment depends on the
**refusal** of the image of **completion**]{.underline} ... [Because
Real enjoyment poses such a threat to the social order]{.underline}, the
**[contemporary command]{.underline}** to enjoy [cannot find an outlet
in this kind of enjoyment]{.underline}. (McGowan, 2004, pages 70--71)

[Encircling]{.underline} the [Real of climate change
implies]{.underline}, among other things, the
[transformation]{.underline} and re-symbolisation of the imaginary upon
which the [need and urgency of environmental]{.underline} action is
[legitimized and sustained]{.underline}. What it takes is an [anamorphic
gaze that looks in an 'awry']{.underline} (see Žižek, 1992) way at the
[**imaginaries** that underlie the **impulse to engage politically**
with climate change]{.underline}. This might offer a glimpse of the
([political) Real of the situation and disclose the **structure of the
fantasies**]{.underline} that **[drive]{.underline}** the [current
impotent **climate actions**]{.underline}. The [hegemonic]{.underline}
and symptomatic [base]{.underline} upon which the
[legitimacy]{.underline} of the [environmental discourse]{.underline}
and practice of both mainstream and [more activist climate movements is
predicated rests,]{.underline} we contend, **[upon repressed
traumas]{.underline}**, [which are displaced onto a fantasmagorical
imaginary]{.underline} (see Swyngedouw, 2022a, 2022d).
[Opening]{.underline} **[different political-ecological]{.underline}**
**[trajectories]{.underline}** [requires transgressing the fantasies
that conceal these traumas]{.underline}. In other words, if it is true
that "\[r\]ather than adjusting analysands to [accept the world or
become satisfied with it, \[psycho\]analysis works to break them from
their compromise satisfaction, thus holding out the possibility of a
Real enjoyment"]{.underline} (McGowan, 2004, page 223), then, we
propose, something similar holds true for a [psychoanalytic account of
climate change enjoyment.]{.underline}

Embracing a Real enjoyment of climate change requires breaking with
"Mother Nature" once and for all. Above, we have [emphasized that much
of today\'s **political response** to climate change still relies on a
**fantasy** of Nature as (m)Other]{.underline}. [Nature]{.underline}
either functions as a [realm of libidinal attachment]{.underline} from
[which you take what you want and which you enjoy as long as the supply
lasts]{.underline}, as a place of **[nostalgic]{.underline}**
**[longing]{.underline}** to [which one tries to return at all
costs]{.underline}, a **[lost arcadia]{.underline}** of [ultimate
enjoyment]{.underline}, which has been [ruined recklessly]{.underline},
or as an [**"enemy"** against whom it is necessary to
defend]{.underline} [oneself]{.underline}.11 In these cases, [Nature
receives its attention as a **phantasmatic figure of the
Other**]{.underline}. That is why [one can use it, reify
it,]{.underline} and [abuse it on the one hand]{.underline}, and [strive
and long for it, on the other.]{.underline} Nature is here situated 'out
there', as a realm that exists, or at least existed, apart from and next
to our actions.

This [fantasy]{.underline} of [Nature]{.underline} as mOther is
particularly [prevalent in the idea of a Nature to which we could return
if we defeated climate chang]{.underline}e. While in the [pleasurable
destruction of Nature]{.underline} it is at least clear that in the [end
there will not be much left of Nature when humans are done with
it,]{.underline} the idea of a return to Nature is not even able to
accept this. Here, the [subject]{.underline} gets [fully caught in the
lure of]{.underline} **[fantasy]{.underline}**. While in this fantasy,
["Nature as a big Mother is just another image of the divine big
Other"]{.underline} (Žižek, 2016, page 31), a [Real]{.underline}
[enjoyment]{.underline} of climate change is [based on the premise that
the big]{.underline} [mOther does not exist]{.underline}. The only kind
of nature a Real enjoyment of climate change can rely on is what Lacan
calls "rotten" nature, a nature that is not natural, but unnatural, as
inherently out-of-joint, as there is something called culture rotting
inside of it[: "it is quite clear that nature is not as natural as all
that, it is even in this that there consists this rottenness which is
what is generally called culture" (Lacan, 1974, n.p.).]{.underline} From
the standpoint of Lacan\'s rotten nature, we find ourselves confronted
with the [uncanny moment of losing (any sense of) Nature as our horizon
of meaning and foundation of society (Pohl, 2020).]{.underline}

There is [no final guarantee in Nature on which to base our politics or
the social]{.underline}, on which to mirror our dreams, hopes,
aspirations or fears, on w[hich to ground our desires and plans for a
different, let alone better, and socio-ecologically]{.underline} more
sensitive [mode of living]{.underline} together. [Mother
Nature]{.underline} is no-Thing. She [does not exist, neither as 'good'
nor as 'bad']{.underline}. All we have is a
**[fundamentally]{.underline}** **[chaotic]{.underline}**, inconsistent,
lacking [nature]{.underline}, without capital N, and all humans can do
is to master this nature in a way that allows humans and non-humans,
i.e., everybody and everything, to live on this planet. Against this
background, it needs to be emphasized -- as various interlocutors argued
-- [that **climate change** has so far **hit** hardest those who were
**already marginalized**, thereby **reproducing fundamental lines** of
inequality, violence and repression, which in turn extends the larger
struggles catalyzed by colonialism, imperialism, industrialism,
capitalism, international development, and geopolitics]{.underline}
(Davis et al., 2019; Nixon, 2013; Sultana, 2022; Todd, 2016; Whyte,
2016). [To avoid a further exacerbation of these climate
injustice]{.underline}s, one cannot 'stop messing with nature', to
return to the slogan mentioned above. We should by no means leave nature
to itself. It is already too late for that, and in some ways it has
always been too late for that. [Rather, a Real enjoyment of climate
change aims to find ways to mess with nature]{.underline}, so that in
the end there will still be a place left for all of us. [Because that is
what is ultimately at stake with regard to the destruction brought about
by climate change, not the destruction of nature, but the destruction of
human\'s place in it.]{.underline}

Introduction: [topological reflexivity]{.underline}

In their influential overview of the topic, Lury et al. (2012) refer to
**[topology]{.underline}** as a means of describing [contemporary
cultural dynamics]{.underline}. They argue that culture is '[becoming
topological' in so far as]{.underline} [capital]{.underline}, technology
and [information alike can be detached from their cultural and
institutional surroundings]{.underline} and mobilised in a 'space of
flows'. All that used to be distant can now be brought close, all that
was once incompatible and heterogeneous in nature can now be brought
onto a plane of comparison. [Topology]{.underline} refers here, [not
just to a set of cultural and **governmental practices** and
**discourses**]{.underline}, but also to a **[mode of
reflexivity]{.underline}** -- a tendency to think about and a[ct with
regard to **policies** and **technological systems** in society in terms
of topological configurations]{.underline} (Hayles, 2016; Parisi, 2019).
This topological reflexivity is reflected in both the well as the more
sensuous, [abstract cognitive modelling of spaces as visceral and
affective registers in which we feel and sense the world about
us]{.underline} (Lury et al., 2012: 28). The idea of friction-free
mobility and communication has the potential to arouse excitement, and
organising space by [removing]{.underline} the [barriers]{.underline} of
work may be thought to [unravel affective powers]{.underline} of
creativity and innovation.

In the reflexive mode, [topological discourses are at once descriptive
and prescript]{.underline}ive. On the one hand, they anticipate the
allegedly central role of innovations and new technologies globally; on
the other, they produce norms as to how nations and organisations should
adapt to these allegedly inevitable developments. '[Lists', 'models',
'networks', 'clouds' and 'flows' are concepts often used to serve this
double role of the is and the ought]{.underline} (Lury et al., 2012: 4).
This can be discerned, for example, in the claims that the global flow
of labour and [capital is transforming European societies to the extent
that they must not only accommodate this flow, but also increase it to
sustain economic competitiveness in the global market.]{.underline}

This millennium, educational policy studies have also been placing
increasing emphasis on the importance of [policy practices]{.underline}
and structures that show a [topological interest in establishing novel
criteria for distance]{.underline}, [continuity and
commensurability]{.underline} (Saari, 2012; Sellar, 2015; Hartong,
2018). Although studies may not always actually use the term 'topology',
attention has been drawn to the ways in which large educational policy
actors, such as the EU, create [policy spaces that transcend cultural
and national distances by **standardising concepts** and
degrees]{.underline} (Coulby, 2002; Hartong, 2018; Lawn and Grek, 2012),
and through [construction of digital education and **policy
environments**]{.underline} (Hartong and Piattoeva, 2019; Landri, 2018).

An emerging body of literature has also begun to [study the spatial
aspects of education policy in tandem with certain **affective** and
**emotional registers**]{.underline} -- analysing how [topological
discourses may also]{.underline} incite, seduce and
**[provoke]{.underline}**; not just dictate or inform (e.g. Sellar,
2015; Webb and Gulson, 2012: 92; Webb et al., 2020). Topological
instruments such as academic rankings and league tables can elicit
anticipatory feelings of pride, anxiety or shame among students and
staff in educational institutions, which in turn [guide]{.underline}
their [expectations as well as individual and institutional
strategies]{.underline} (Espeland and Sauder, 2016; Piattoeva and Saari,
2020). When it works, [governing these anticipatory affects will
reinforce the positive effects of liberal governance]{.underline}
[without]{.underline} the need for **[open intervention]{.underline}**,
**[commands]{.underline}** or **[forbidding restrictions]{.underline}**
(Brøgger and Staunaes, 2016; Sellar, 2015).

[Topological reflexivity]{.underline} is what also [governs policy
futures]{.underline} in education. It would [explain]{.underline}
'[policy prolepsis']{.underline} (Webb and Gulson, 2012) and
'**[anticipatory governance']{.underline}** (Webb et al., 2020[) -- ways
of **managing** **expectations** so that they **prescribe the policies
then enacted**. **Topological discourses**]{.underline} can be [used to
judge or evaluate the present and to decide on required
intervention]{.underline}. Within this governmental configuration, the
[educational]{.underline} [present]{.underline} appears as a [state of
affairs in need of **reform or planning**]{.underline}, that is, a type
of [**intervention** that is **determined** by a **desired future and/or
past**]{.underline}. (Decuypere and Simons, 2020: 5)

In effect, [**topological discourses** can thus be **self-fulfilling
predictions**]{.underline}: they [cultivate anticipatory
affects]{.underline} [and **emotions** that incite **an attunement to
change**]{.underline} (e.g. the inevitable global trend of
digitalisation), [which in turn may fuel the realisation of these
**future visions**.]{.underline}

In this article, I follow Lury et al.'s (2012) approach to
[investigate]{.underline} this [topologisation]{.underline} as a [mode
of cognitive]{.underline} and [affective reflexivity]{.underline} in
educational [discourses]{.underline}. In particular, I look at how [the
topological aspects]{.underline} of [envisioning and enacting
**anticipated futures**]{.underline} in education can be [used as an
overarching narrative]{.underline} framework to describe the transition
from earlier rigid learning environments to new flexible ones. As a case
in point, I focus on Finnish policy discourses that focus on new spatial
innovations as drivers of sweeping change in comprehensive schools (on
pedagogical, architectural and technological levels). These discourses
govern emotions and affects by promising that fulfilment and elated
experiences of creativity and play at school can be achieved through the
careful design of learning environments and school architecture.

I address the [allure of topological future discourses by looking at
them from the perspective of the **government of desire**]{.underline}.
Drawing on the [Lacanian psychoanalytic tradition]{.underline} of
critically analysing political discourse, this should provide a novel
approach to the [dynamics of topological reflexivity.]{.underline} I
[unpack]{.underline} two [prominent aspects of go**verning desires** by
first asking]{.underline} how it is that a [topological
discourse]{.underline} can **[organise]{.underline}**
**[fantasies]{.underline}** that incite and **[sustain
desire]{.underline}** [in a ceaseless quest to address what is
**lacking** in a subject's existence. Fantasy]{.underline} here is
understood as a [fundamental way]{.underline} to [make sense of social
reality:]{.underline} it provides the [coordinates for
desire]{.underline} by presenting something not previously experienced
as being desirable because it promises fullness, [meaning and
**enjoyment in the future**]{.underline}. I describe how these
[fantasies are used in]{.underline} [topological discourse to spur
people into taking action that they believe will eventually eradicate
spatial divisions and boundaries]{.underline} in education, while
enabling experiences of pleasure in schoolwork for pupils and teachers
alike.

The second aspect is to look at the most prominent inconsistencies in
[these topological discourses and explore how they are dealt
with,]{.underline} as [**fantasies** will invariably contain **certain
incompatible claims**,]{.underline} and aporias that **[preclude
consistency]{.underline}**. While [**topological** discourses posit an
**object of desire**,]{.underline} with its promise of enjoyment and
fulfilment in the future, [they are at the same time caught in a
disavowed compulsion to keep the same object at a distance.]{.underline}
Moreover, while such discourses are founded on a subjective autonomy and
freedom to develop learning environments, they also involve an implicit
injunction for teachers and schools to implement new learning
environments and take pleasure in doing so. Such symptoms of fantasy
lead to discursive strategies of disavowal and othering.

Conclusions

Coming back to the existing research on topological reflexivity
mentioned in the introduction to this article, I will conclude with some
theoretical reflections on the value of a Lacanian approach to the
topic, and argue that an analysis of the [fantasmatic organisation of
desire adds important analytical insights to how space and time are
enacted in]{.underline} educational policy [discourses.]{.underline}

Prominent Deleuzian and [new-materialist approaches]{.underline} to
governing education in sociomaterial networks and assemblages have
[recently problematised the naturalised forms of (Euclidean) space and
(chronological) time as being 'already there' and 'given']{.underline},
and have instead focused on the multiple ways of enacting (rather than
representing) national, institutional and individual boundaries, strata
and rhythms in education (Decuypere and Simons, 2016; Webb and Gulson,
2012). This [approach]{.underline} has also [allowed]{.underline} the
[emergent conduits of power and knowledge]{.underline} in education to
be [traced in their digitalised, mediatised and datafied
forms]{.underline} (see e.g. Thompson and Cook, 2015).

For instance, following [Deleuze's]{.underline} (1995) notion of the
[emergence of control societies]{.underline}, several studies have shown
how the [entangled nature]{.underline} of contemporary [education
spaces]{.underline} -- transnational policy arenas, virtual learning
environments, and classrooms (Piro, 2008; Thompson and Cook, 2014;
Watson 2010) -- are [founded on a 'modular' logic of
governance]{.underline}. By [not confining governance to
educational]{.underline} or [workplace institutions]{.underline},
modular logic [involves ever-shifting assemblages of
technology]{.underline}, [materials]{.underline} and
[discourses]{.underline}, as well as [ways of thinking and
feeling]{.underline}. These elements [constantly reconfigure
proximity,]{.underline} [differences and mobility]{.underline}, while
simultaneously [ensuring carefully calibrated modes of
individual]{.underline} [freedom]{.underline}. Today, such modular logic
takes place in education, for instance, in embedding traditional
classrooms into malleable learning ecosystems or digital learning
platforms (Webb et al., 2020).

What a [Lacanian]{.underline} approach can [add to these analyses is a
means for explaining the paradoxical, self-conflicting and disavowing
characteristics of governance enacted in such space-times]{.underline}.
Primarily this stems from the focus on the doubling of a material object
or space. As noted above, there is always a [necessary distance between
**fantasmatic and 'real' space-times**;]{.underline} what [motivates
subjects]{.underline} are not the real [spaces or objects
themselves,]{.underline} but the [ephemeral objects of
desire]{.underline} which [can never be]{.underline} actually
[attained.]{.underline}

This focus enables a particular explanation of the anticipatory or
proleptic nature of policies. As mentioned above, [topological
discourses]{.underline} are **[fuelled]{.underline}** [by a desire for
future fulfilment in the form of]{.underline} [uninhibited
communication]{.underline}, creativity and playfulness -- both in
education and at work. This often [takes the form of overcoming
**various obstacles to enjoyment**]{.underline} -- such as the
**[boundaries]{.underline}** between branches of an organisation,
[between school subjects]{.underline}, between different
company--customer interfaces, or [**between education and 'real
life'**.]{.underline} What is paradoxical here is that, in order to
harness this desire, these discourses invariably require the existence
of those very boundaries that they claim to be abolishing.

Furthermore, the characteristic of space-times as fantasmatic objects
may explain the endless repetition and somewhat 'hysterical' (Clarke,
2019) demands inherent in topological discourses; hysterical insofar as
they incessantly seek to achieve what can never be attained to begin
with, and that is why no amount of digital technology, partitions or
furniture can ever satisfy these demands. The inevitable failure of
these efforts then fuels anticipation of seemingly new ways to overcome
the obstacles to enjoyment. So, in spite of evident changes in material
spaces, at the discursive level, topological reflexivity is caught in a
timeless moment of spinning wheels.

Finally, it is often reiterated in critical education policy studies
that governmental discourses in control societies consistently emphasise
the freedom of those being governed. [This means that **subjects** must
be **lured** into **implementing certain changes** in the name of their
personal freedom, fulfilment and well-being.]{.underline} Yet it is also
[reminded that this form of governance is never totalising]{.underline}
in the sense of [subduing all opposition and]{.underline}
[dissent]{.underline} -- its [**topological assemblages** always **leave
room for evasions** and forms of resistance.]{.underline} What a
[Lacanian approach can add here is that it aids in locating the tension
between domination and resistance at the stage of desire]{.underline};
subjects must be [enticed into desiring certain environments as the
gateway to their enjoyment.]{.underline} It also shows how [political
fantasies grapple with those naysayers by othering them]{.underline} --
not necessarily for hosting false beliefs or violating explicit norms --
but for [refusing to desire in the right way.]{.underline}

In The Myth of Sisyphus,1) Albert Camus presents Sisyphus as a metaphor
for the futility of repetitive actions, endlessly rolling a boulder
uphill. [This paper uses the Sisyphus metaphor to highlight the

constructivist IR and epistemological critique, this [analysis exposes
the persistence of **Western**-**centric modes of validation** in Arctic

"relevant knowledge" or "expertise" remains unresolved, despite a
growing body of literature on the Arctic Council's observer criteria. By
engaging with cases such as Turkey, this article contributes to
expanding the geo-epistemological debate, arguing [for greater
reflexivity in how Arctic knowledge regimes are constructed and
challenged.]{.underline}

Geo-Epistemology and the Arctic

Geo-epistemology refers to knowledge and discourses formed in specific
spaces and grounded in spatial thinking. This paper critiques
geo-epistemology in the Arctic, drawing on Foucauldian thought to
emphasize that space itself is also shaped by knowledge, power, and
discourses.2) This paper confronts the imperial perspective inherent in
chronologies and historization, recognizing it as a dominant paradigm
and hegemonic discourse that privileges certain narratives while
marginalizing others.3) This Eurocentric framework deeply embedded
within Western/European academic institutions, perpetuates
geo-epistemological hierarchies that uphold monopolies of knowledge.

[International Relations categorizes world politics by using
location-based references, such as the Western/non-Western]{.underline},
**[global North/global]{.underline}** **[South]{.underline}**,
domestic/foreign or national/international divide.4) [Classic IR then
relies on binaries, which is one of the major criticisms to its
geo-epistemological stance.]{.underline}

[Geographical classifications]{.underline} are particularly [prominent
in the **Arctic**]{.underline}, where the distinction between **[Arctic
and non-Arctic states is deeply ingrained]{.underline}**. This [binary
framework is reinforced consistently]{.underline} in [academic and
political gatherings, publications, and everyday
discussions]{.underline}. Such categorization often ties knowledge
[exclusively to specific geographic locations]{.underline},
**[emphasizing boundaries]{.underline}** [rather]{.underline} than
recognizing the [transnational and **transdisciplinary origins** of
expertise]{.underline}. There is no doubt that scientists from facts
[Arctic countries perceive, experience, and understand]{.underline} and
situations that non-Arctic scientists cannot. However, the reverse is
also true. Non[-Arctic scientists may -though not always- possess a
certain distance from the Arctic that allows them to perceive different
realities, consider alternative approaches, or arrive at distinct
findings]{.underline}. This is even the case between Arctic cities,
Oslo-Moscow relations are different from Kirkenes-Murmansk relations
regarding the Arctic.

This [division and **geo-epistemological** hierarchy **marginalizes**
the **expertise of non-Arctic experts**]{.underline}. But more
importantly, **[it limits Indigenous participation in Arctic
affairs]{.underline}**.5) In [these binaries, the state is the central
actor in decision-making process on defining what knowledge is relevant
or]{.underline} not.(Ellam Y, Raymond-Yakoubian J, Aluaq D & Behe C
(2022). A framework for co-production of knowledge in the context of
Arctic research, Ecology and Society, 27(1):34)) [Criticisms persist
regarding the inclusion of Indigenous voices in decision-making
processes]{.underline}, both within their respective countries and in
forums like the Arctic Council.6) [For instance, when the Arctic
**Council suspended** **cooperation** with Russia in 2022, the
**decision was made solely by the seven Arctic states.**]{.underline}

In examples of [Arctic-specific programs]{.underline}, the [exclusivity
of organizations]{.underline} such as the **[Arctic
Council]{.underline}** or Arctic Economic Council internships and the
[Arctic Fulbright Initiative]{.underline} to citizens of the [eight
Arctic states highlights a **monopolization of knowledge** and
specialization confined to these states' citizens]{.underline}. This
exclusivity, while potentially fostering regional expertise, also
**[limits diverse perspectives]{.underline}** and [hinders the
globalization of Arctic knowledge]{.underline}. Consequently, it
[contributes to an endogenous epistemology]{.underline}, where
[knowledge production in the Arctic predominantly relies]{.underline}
[on literature narrowly focused on the Arctic context.]{.underline}
Furthermore, this exclusivity not only restricts the globalization of
Arctic knowledge but also [raises questions about how the Arctic is
geographically and conceptually defined]{.underline}. For instance,
while an American citizen from Hawaii is naturally eligible for Arctic
expertise, an Estonian citizen living in Tromsø is excluded by the
imaginary boundaries drawn, thereby narrowing the field of expertise.

[Spatial thinking plays an important role in defining
geo-epistemological thinking,]{.underline} which informs the location of
knowledge. In the [Arctic Council,]{.underline} there are criteria used
to assess the suitability of applicants as observer states.7) First,
[observers]{.underline} must [acknowledge the legal
framework]{.underline} of the [Arctic]{.underline}
[governance]{.underline} and the **[sovereignty of eight Arctic
states]{.underline}** and must **[possess relevant Arctic
expertise]{.underline}**---a term that remains somewhat ambiguous and
may benefit from further clarification due to its broad scope.8)
Moreover, [observers are expected to contribute to
strengthening]{.underline} the [work]{.underline} of the permanent
participants, though how this impact is measured is not clearly defined.
It remains unclear exactly how the impact of their contributions can be
measured.9)

This [situation]{.underline} seems to [reinforce]{.underline} the
[Arctic Council's commitment to preserving]{.underline} an
[Arctic]{.underline} [core]{.underline} of the [eight Arctic
states]{.underline} and their relationships with permanent
participants.10) Knecht notes that observers remain as mere observers
within the Council's governance. Kankaanpää and Young, on the other
hand, highlights a significant gap between observers' aspirations and
the reality within the Arctic Council, with minimal evidence to counter
the claim [that "the Arctic Council has not effectively integrated
non-Arctic experts into its projects."11)]{.underline}

Monopolies of Knowledge and Power in the Arctic

The [concept of monopolies of knowledge]{.underline}, first proposed by
Canadian economic historian Harold Innis in the context of
communication, [highlights how **dominant** **classes maintain
political** **power** by controlling fundamental communication
technologies]{.underline}.12) Innis suggests that
[monopolies]{.underline} of [knowledge emerge]{.underline} when
[established hierarchies become rigid and disconnected]{.underline} from
social realities, [**hindering** the development of **new ways of
thinking**]{.underline}. In the [Arctic Council,]{.underline} [holding
the]{.underline} essential [power to evaluate what counts as
expertise]{.underline} aligns with the ambiguous assessment process of
what is considered "relevant knowledge." The term "relevant" has, in a
sense, become a buzzword, [highly open to interpretation, **leading to
the production** not to the knowledge we need but to the knowledge we
**desire**.]{.underline}

The [**Arctic Council** itself **embodies** the geopolitical discourse
surrounding the]{.underline} Arctic, where [ostensibly]{.underline}
[objective binaries shape spatial imaginaries that **prioritize certain
types of expertise**]{.underline} while marginalizing others.
[Monopolies of knowledge, in this context, can contribute to a
separation between the evaluation of Arctic and non-Arctic
knowledge]{.underline}, as such monopolies favor centralization of
power. [**Those who control knowledge** ultimately **possess** the
**power** to define what is to be governed.]{.underline}

Applications for Observer Status from 2015 to 2021

In 2021, Ireland, Czech Republic, and Estonia applied for observer
status in the Arctic Council but were rejected.13) Each of these
countries had prepared detailed applications to align with the Arctic
Council's fields of interest; however, there is not any official
explanation regarding the rejections, which raises questions about the
Arctic Council's hesitations toward expansion.14) Filimonova et al. also
mention that all these applicant states are NATO members (Czech
Republic, Estonia) or individual partner countries (Ireland), and their
applications may have faced opposition from Russia, which is resistant
to NATO-aligned states.15)

In 2015, Turkey, Greece, and Mongolia submitted applications for
observer status but were also rejected without an official explanation.
An interviewee16) from the Arctic Council suggested geopolitical
considerations as a factor in these decisions.17)

These [patterns reveal underlying dynamics of
geo-epistemology]{.underline} and [knowledge monopolies]{.underline}
that are **[rooted in imperialistic ideologies]{.underline}**. By
examining such decisions, we gain insights into how expertise is defined
and who controls what is considered relevant knowledge within
geopolitical bodies like the Arctic Council. As Andreeva and Rottem
argue, active engagement in research not only advances academic
knowledge but also aligns with foreign policy objectives and enhances
visibility.18)

Building on the discussion of knowledge monopolization and
geo-epistemology, Turkey's application for observer status in the Arctic
Council serves as a good example. In Turkish media, there was no
coverage of Turkey's application for observer status in the Arctic
Council, nor of the subsequent rejection of its applications. Similarly,
within the Arctic Council itself, information regarding applications and
rejections of observer status remains sparse.19) This lack of
transparency appears to extend to some scientists and decision-makers
who are unaware of these states' applications.

An intriguing piece of feedback at a panel at the 2024 Arctic Congress
in Bodø regarding Turkey's observer application to the Arctic Council
raised the question: How would Turkey contribute to the Arctic? On a
practical level, the feedback emphasized that ministerial and official
meetings are frequently held in remote areas, making accessibility
challenging. Additionally, a shortage of facilities to accommodate all
participants was cited as a reason to limit the number of observers.

This feedback on Turkey's application is valid to some extent but also
reflects underlying biases. The bias in the comment "What could Turkey
contribute?" stems from an assumption that Turkey is a monolithic
entity, failing to recognize the diversity within its scientific and
critical political communities in opposition to the current regime which
can be called démocrature.20)

This [highlights how **identity and geopolitics** **intersect** to
sustain the dominance]{.underline} [of hegemonic political narratives in
defining legitimacy in international governance]{.underline}. While
Mediterranean countries like Italy, Spain, and France are observer
states, their [Arctic engagement has historically been
framed]{.underline} within the [context]{.underline} of their [European
identity]{.underline} and alignment with the broader Western bloc.
Turkey's Mediterranean identity, however, intersects with its perceived
Middle Eastern identity and its Eurasian positioning. From an
Orientalist perspective21) Turkey is often perceived as a Middle Eastern
country in terms of its identity, and Eurasian in terms of its
aspirations. On the other hand, the acceptance of Asian countries to
observer status reflects geo-economic and geopolitical considerations,
beyond the relevant knowledge criteria. [Essentially, the East is what
the West makes of it.]{.underline}

Interviews and the literature reveal that the opacity of the application
process and decision-making raises questions about the inclusivity and
effectiveness of the Arctic Council. Inclusion is crucial for broadening
knowledge, particularly on global issues like environmental protection
and climate change. However, decisions regarding observer status seem to
be more influenced by politics than by scientific or environmental
factors.

Thus, [geopolitical consideration is still at the forefront of knowledge
production and accepting observers to the Council]{.underline}.22) The
analyses also show that the field of Arctic IR often remains deeply
Western and European-centric, adhering to a worldview rooted in cultural
and regional perspectives inherited from colonial empires.23) [This
approach limits the diversity of perspectives in the field and
reinforces hegemonic views that may not capture the complexities of
contemporary geopolitics.]{.underline}

[Reimagining Knowledge and expertise instead of relevant
epistemology]{.underline}

Such a **[rigid worldview]{.underline}**, [with its emphasis on
**spatial boundaries** and **established political
positions**]{.underline}, risks [**reinforcing** a static, **monolithic
conception** of knowledge rather than fostering the growth of expertise
in the Arctic]{.underline}. At the end of The Myth of Sisyphus, Camus
writes, "I leave Sisyphus at the foot of the mountain! One always finds
one's burden again...The struggle itself towards the heights is enough
to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy."24) [Much like
Camus's imagining, which he presents as a **rebellion against the
futility of repetition; challenging**]{.underline} the
[established]{.underline} [expertise and methodologies]{.underline} in
the Arctic and in International Relations **[may require a similar act
of rebellion.]{.underline}** [Such **reimagining** is **essential** to
**break away from the repetitive paradigms** since the Arctic is larger
than the Arctic.]{.underline}

From the complex interplay between geo-epistemology, knowledge
monopolies, and geopolitical dynamics, we can conclude that if the
Arctic Council can be understood as a legitimate institution claiming to
set standards based on knowledge and expertise, it should apply more
explicit criteria to non-state observers and provide explanations for
rejections. As examples, there are also other regional platforms who
accept non-regional actors to their governance mechanisms to address
issues. In this sense, for example, limited observer statues or dialogue
partners, three-year partnership models from ASEAN, Pacific Islands
Forum would be interesting to respond to the criticisms about the
acceptance of observers and criteria and to be more inclusive.

We now live in a world where Qatar and Azerbaijan host COP meetings, and
where Saudi Arabia, known for its outdoor air conditioning, is a
signatory of the Svalbard Treaty and negotiates oil prices with Russia.
It is therefore not possible to keep the Arctic isolated from the
others, particularly given what it offers and what it faces. [Thus,
rather than hierarchy, heterarchy is more suitable for evaluating
expertise and shaping the discourse of power.]{.underline}

[Legal imagination]{.underline} -- polar and otherwise -- is [rather
poor]{.underline}. It follo[ws the doctrines of international law which
**transpose** state **sovereign concerns** onto the international
stage.]{.underline} As the **[multiple planetary crises]{.underline}**
unfold, [international law has]{.underline} proven [**unable** to find
adequate solutions]{.underline}. In a field only responsive to crises,1)
the **[overlapping]{.underline}** and **[interconnected]{.underline}**
[planetary **crises**]{.underline} of our times might have become out of
touch. In this context, our article asks whether there is still space
for legal imagination within the field of polar law. We [argue that to
come to terms with current planetary politics in the polar
regions]{.underline}, there is a [need to **re-examine** the
constellations of **legal norms** relevant to regional
governance]{.underline} (i.e., p[olar law as a normative
field]{.underline}) and **[academic discourse]{.underline}** (i.e.,
**[polar law as an epistemic field]{.underline}**) to assess where they
fail to answer the concerns of our times and how we, as the community of
"polar practitioners," and "polar legal scholars" [find space to
speculate and expand polar legal imagination]{.underline} to m[ore
adequately account for planetary governance.]{.underline} To open up
legal imagination in this context can materialise through a multitude of
different epistemic and normative interventions. For instance, [a
complete reimagination of what we consider "good" "governance" for the
poles could mean to think about how normative thought and practice
account for the myriads of more-than-human modes of existence in the
region]{.underline}, **[challenge]{.underline}** [traditional
hierarchical **relationships** between sovereign states and diverse
entities]{.underline}, both living and non-living and propose new modes
of thinking with and against normativity for and in the Arctic.

[One way we have tried to open up the space for thinking along
**theoretical and material critiques** of **polar law**]{.underline} and
building on experiences from three years of engagement between polar
lawyers and the Critical Legal Conference (CLC), we discuss [potential
**alternatives** to law's interaction with Arctic existence and agency
**beyond conventional** state-centric **legalities**]{.underline}. These
alternatives force us to [acknowledge the Arctic(s) and the polar
regions as **non-fixed** and **dynamic** **spaces** where
sovereignty]{.underline}, [legality, and normativity are fluid and
mutable.]{.underline} To conclude we argue that [thinking on speculative
registers]{.underline} can help to **[reassemble legal sovereignty
constructs]{.underline}** in [response to the poles' changing
landscapes.]{.underline} Expanding Arctic legal imagination to the
confines of the Earth provides an aperture to articulate new forms of
coexistence and justice to pave the way for legal theory and practice to
account for molecular-planetary concerns.

A Brief History of Polar Law

To find out whether there is room -- at all -- for legal imagination
within the field, it is necessary to go back to the history of polar law
as a normative field. A history or official hagiography of polar law is
not difficult to do as it follows the lines of international and
domestic laws' evolutions for and in the poles. However, much like any
other field of international law, the [historical principles behind
polar law are rooted in questions of **sovereignty**]{.underline},2)
**[dominion]{.underline}**,3) **[colonialism]{.underline}**,4)
(over)**[exploitation]{.underline}** of natural resources,5)
**[enclosure]{.underline}** (which is arguably linked to colonialism),
and **[exclusion]{.underline}** of people (mainly in the Arctic --
[again linked to the region's colonial past and present) and
**environment**]{.underline}. Again, and without much surprise, these
[reflect the Arctic littoral states' modes of governance]{.underline}.
These [frameworks]{.underline} have primarily been [focused on the
**management of polar spaces** through the lens of **national
interests**]{.underline}, often [**prioritising** and enabling states'
interests of **power projections**, control, and economic
interests.]{.underline}

In this context, [polar law has been a **reactive tool**]{.underline}
**for** managing resources and [delineating geopolitical
boundaries]{.underline} -- reflecting a [certain capitalist mode of
"seeing like a state]{.underline}"6) through which [states']{.underline}
[managerial]{.underline} [processes]{.underline} of geographical
enclosure and [control as well as the exploitation of all
living]{.underline} and non-living entities [for]{.underline} the
[accumulation]{.underline} of wealth [become an **ontological
practice**]{.underline} [to stabilise state sovereignty both globally
and domestically]{.underline}. And although law relevant to the polar
regions has since evolved (albeit slightly), these [**state logics**
remain what **ontologically frame** the **production** of **legal**
**norms** in the region]{.underline}. However, as we all know, the
[challenges facing the poles go far beyond the traditional states' modes
of existence]{.underline}. Polar [geopolitics]{.underline} and
[governance]{.underline} is [driven by ontological framings]{.underline}
of the [regions **as the terrain of states and for states**
--]{.underline} be them Arctic or non-Arctic.7) The
[multiple]{.underline} [ecological crises]{.underline} unfolding in
these regions and beyond **[pose legal and ethical
questions]{.underline}** that cannot be addressed by existing frameworks
alone. In that regard, and as we have said before, [law -- polar
and]{.underline} otherwise [-- fails us]{.underline}.8) So why should we
even try to save it?

International Legal Imagination: From past to present

At times when there are failures of law, where the legal practice has
difficulty catching up with the factual reality, [lawyers have
historically engaged in, what could be loosely termed, exercises of
legal imagination]{.underline}. For instance, as Koskenniemi outlines,
the [founding figures of international law]{.underline} -- French,
Spanish, British, German and so on -- [engaged in **legal imagination**
to shape the making of international norms and principles]{.underline}
to transpose their own visions and understandings of governance onto the
international stage -- again as a means of [**projecting their own**
**vision** of what ought to be]{.underline}. So at historical junctures,
these [legal technicians]{.underline} (i.e., European lawyers) ma[pped
their ideal governance future]{.underline} with the modalities of their
legal times. In that context, they [used]{.underline} [everything at
hand]{.underline} (e.g., **[theology]{.underline}**,
**[roman]{.underline}** **[law]{.underline}**, **[raison
d'état]{.underline}**, **[politics]{.underline}**, even natural
**[science]{.underline}**, physics and biology) [as novel frames to
imagine and argue differently]{.underline}.9) "[Legal]{.underline}
[imagining]{.underline} is [both specific to the time and
place]{.underline} where it takes place and continuous with imagining
that has taken place and will occur in different places and at different
times."10) Yet, [these historical modalities inherently guide
contemporary imagination]{.underline} through a [**framework** of
**objectivity**, **neutrality**, and **universality** in legal
discourse]{.underline}, elements that can be [traced back
to]{.underline} international [law's]{.underline} very
[inception.]{.underline} In other words, international law, including
**[polar law,]{.underline}** [continues to be influenced by a "**deeply
rooted" mindset** that often overlooks the dynamics of
power]{.underline}, the constraints on potential [legal
interpretations]{.underline}, and the universalization of a 'particular'
approach of legal speculation that [**reflects** the imagination of 17th
and 18th century **Western masculinist lawyers** as well as their own
**imperial**]{.underline} and [**colonial** **projects**.]{.underline}

[Historicizing]{.underline} the [values underpinning polar
law]{.underline} by [**dismissing** them as mere '**standards of the
past'** in]{.underline} academic [discourse]{.underline} [overlooks
their **ongoing influence** in the 'present']{.underline}. [Polar law is
'present']{.underline} and is far from flawless. This stance
[consequently neglects the intricate and often overt
connections]{.underline} between modern [legal]{.underline} knowledge
[and]{.underline} various forms of [power]{.underline}, including those
[based on race,11) class,12) and]{.underline} [gender]{.underline}.13)
[Such legal knowledge mirrors the cultural values associated with
modernity]{.underline}. It is evident in the Arctic through a range of
daily challenges faced by the region, impacting the material world,
biodiversity, Indigenous populations, and the broader future of the
planet. [It signifies the **outcomes** of a pervasive **power
structure** that has consistently accompanied international law that
**transcends** the **legal** **orders** of the polar
regions.]{.underline}

Expanding Polar Legal Imagination: Speculation and Prefiguration

As outlined in the introduction, law is typically a reactive discipline;
it responds to crises, disputes, or the needs of states. This is where
speculation comes into play, [but how do we speculate (as a practice)
with a focus on the polar regions]{.underline}? Speculative legal praxis
invites us to [proactively imagine alternative futures]{.underline}.
This is [not just about responding to immediate threats]{.underline} to
the polar environments (environmental law has not managed to do that in
a century of normative developments); it is [about]{.underline}
**[rethinking the legal frameworks themselves]{.underline}**,
[**questioning** their **assumptions**, and **envisioning** new
**possibilities** for polar law.]{.underline} One way of doing
speculation is through the [concept of prefiguration]{.underline}, as a
means of [imagining the future we want]{.underline}. In that sense,
[prefiguration]{.underline} allows us to **[move beyond]{.underline}**
the confines of **[existing legal systems]{.underline}** and ask
fundamental questions: what is the future of the polar regions we want?
And how do we transpose this vision of the future into a normative
endeavour? [Just as the poles are transforming as a result of the
climate and environmental crises, so too must our **legal** **concepts**
become **more fluid, adaptive, and interconnected**.]{.underline}
Traditional categories like [sovereignty]{.underline}, legality, and
[normativity]{.underline}, which have [historically been fixed and
stable,]{.underline} are now being **[challenged]{.underline}**
[by]{.underline} [ecological instability]{.underline}. This demands that
we move away from static legal systems towards more adaptive legal
orders, ones that can respond to molecular-planetary concerns and
ecological limits.

[**Speculative thinking** is not simply a means to escape from the
present]{.underline}. It is a **[political praxis]{.underline}** to
reimagine and [reconstruct]{.underline} legal [knowledge]{.underline}
that can [respond]{.underline} [to the complex]{.underline}, entangled
[realities]{.underline} of the polar regions. It allows us to [think
**beyond** the binaries of **state vs. non-state actors**]{.underline},
human vs. non-human interests, and **[utilitarian resource extraction
vs. environmental protection]{.underline}**. Instead, it [invites us to
consider a normative system that respects Indigenous
knowledge]{.underline}, [non-human sovereignties]{.underline}, and the
[interdependence of all life forms within these fragile
ecosystems]{.underline}. For us, to think of polar law on a speculative
register means not just imagining future scenarios and arguments for
legal governance but an overall rethinking of our way of polar
governance itself. [Speculation]{.underline}, in this sense, is [not
just about creating fictitious futures but an]{.underline} **active**,
[**creative** and critical **process**]{.underline} of
**[prefiguration]{.underline}**, as a means to envision the kind of
polar governance we want to see in the future as both a normative and a
political resituating exercise. [If **prefiguration** becomes a
**political** and normative praxis, then speculative **academia**
becomes the **venue for scholars to politicise**.]{.underline}

Speculative Academia -- [A turn to 'Critical Polar
Jurisprudence']{.underline}

Using prefiguration as a point of analytical departure, we asked
ourselves what is the kind of future that we want to have in the polar
regions? [**Polar Law**, as a subset of international law, is an
**artefact** deeply embedded within the sociocultural paradigm of
modernity and is **inevitably infected** with the methodologies and
ideologies of this paradigm.]{.underline} The field of Polar Law as an
academic discipline is riddled with doctrinal and formalist approaches
to the Arctic and Antarctic legal issues[. As international law
researchers, we are often trained to look for gaps in our polar legal
realities to heal]{.underline} (de lege ferenda), with almost messianic
ambitions, the [ills of our global collective social and environmental
factual realities]{.underline}. Polar law is no exception, and
black-letter methodologies abound. Even scholars whose research involves
environmental law, decolonisation or people liberation movements, whose
themes are perhaps more synonymous with a broad understanding of
'justice', often frame their arguments through a doctrinal lens to gain
legitimacy.

[As we aim to reimagine polar law]{.underline} in ways that are **[not
limited to state modes of existence]{.underline}** b[ut include humans
and more-than-human entities alike in this process,]{.underline} since
August 2022 we have opened the register of speculation to what we term a
'**[critical]{.underline}** [turn' to polar law.]{.underline} In doing
so, we contented that it was perhaps time to think of 'Critical Polar
Jurisprudence.' In this context, we have been convening two streams
annually at both the Polar Law Symposium14) and the Critical Legal
Conference (CLC). The Polar Law Symposium gathers researchers from
around the globe on an annual basis, providing a platform for the
exchange of research-based scientific knowledge on a variety of issues
pertinent to polar regions. Conversely, the CLC, which has been a
pivotal gathering since its inception in 1986, serves as a critical
venue for examining legal and political issues, through a vast array of
theoretical approaches. [That said, the Critical Polar Law initiative
has emerged to bring these two together]{.underline},
[reevaluate]{.underline} the [assumptions]{.underline} commonly held
about the polar regions and to [address emerging issues in]{.underline}
[polar law through]{.underline} the lens of [**critical
jurisprudence**.]{.underline} It aims to **[deconstruct existing legal
realities]{.underline}**, [such as the **premise** of conceptual
**superiority of state sovereignty** and its role **as the moulder of
law** and life in the polar regions.]{.underline}

Our way to [speculate and prefigure]{.underline} the future of polar law
was to [engage on **several topics** from a more **theoretical
perspective** with justice at the centre]{.underline}. While theories of
justice have have recently been advanced for Arctic governance,15) thus
far our theoretical endeavours have focused on broadening this
conversation not to focus neither governance nor on the poles
specifically. In an age where planetary politics are being reassembled,
we thought it was worth addressing what lies beyond. We therefore
[**chose** "**theorising**" as a means of prefiguration and **practice**
to assess why the polar regions can be a site of theoretical inquiries.
Along the way, **we articulated thoughts** around alternative
**theoretical reassessments of polar law.**]{.underline}

First, we advance the term **[Hyperborean Legalities]{.underline}** to
"[summon **dreamy visions** of **an alternative legal** **imaginary**
for the world's northernmost region"]{.underline} and to
[analyse]{.underline} the **[Arctic as a liminal space]{.underline}**,
one that [exists **beyond** **legal**]{.underline} dogmatic
[approaches]{.underline}. Conceptually, [Hyperborean Legalities allowed
us to challenge]{.underline} the superiority of [state
sovereignty]{.underline} and its role as the moulder of law and life in
the region. The idea is to [challenge]{.underline} both the [way the
poles are often imagined as empty, frozen, dark lands]{.underline}, and
think alongside the different shapes, forms, and sources of
normativity/ies in the regions.16)

Second, and building on the Hyperborea, [we analysed how the poles are
portrayed as "common]{.underline} [refuge]{.underline}", and "[areas
beyond sovereignty,"]{.underline} yet also as spaces where [state
sovereignty]{.underline}/ies are often ontologically [reinforced as a
tool of exclusion]{.underline}. In this context, in [mainstream legal
imagination]{.underline}, they become "**[quasi-frozen
sanctuaries]{.underline}**" where [law freezes yet governance
thrives]{.underline}. In these [perceived]{.underline} [liminal
regions]{.underline} with complex legal, environmental, and social
dynamics, [**challenging** dominant]{.underline} [governance
**structures** and traditional]{.underline} **[norms]{.underline}**.
These [regions]{.underline}, with their shifting cryospheric
landscapes,17) [serve as sanctuaries that **bring to light** the urgent
need to address **climate** change]{.underline} and
[reconsider]{.underline} the **[relationship between humans and marine
spaces]{.underline}**. However, [another narrative can be storied; one
where the fluidity, materiality, and disappearance of
ice18]{.underline}) can be thought of as a "sanctuary" that invites a
r[ethinking of environmental protection, legal frameworks, and the
struggle against territorial enclosures]{.underline} in a destabilised
planetary context. To come back to prefiguration, [water]{.underline} in
a frozen state **[can become a source of law]{.underline}**. Its
disappearance and the longing for the cold help speculate a normative
future that [cares for the human and non-human modes]{.underline} of
existence it supports.19) This [care is not merely a passive concern but
an **active relational engagement**]{.underline}, [recognizing the
interconnectedness of human and non-human entities.20)]{.underline}
Thinking about ice as a source of law thus allows us to [leave behind
landlocked]{.underline} [state-bound legal thinking]{.underline},
**[transcend]{.underline}** the [constructed]{.underline}
**[ontology]{.underline}** of a land-sea dichotomy, and [**think
fluidilly about oceanic spaces** in all their passing and temporal
physical states.]{.underline}

Lastly, it is important to acknowledge that any [political and
theoretical engagements]{.underline} with the [governance of polar
regions cannot be detached from multiple unfolding planetary
crises]{.underline}. The [pitfall]{.underline} of structuring the
production [of epistemic and normative knowledge]{.underline} around
delimited geographies is that it can [lead to **tunnel vision** where
one becomes **unable** to see **beyond regional impacts**]{.underline}.
Much like states, [**polar geographies** have been carefully
**constructed** along]{.underline} sovereign lines.21) To [resist the
ever-creeping might of sovereign powers]{.underline}, it is therefore
**[important to prefigure polar governance]{.underline}** [as planetary
politics and part of the Earth system.]{.underline} As such, polar
governance needs to come to terms that nothing is polar yet everything
is. In Cirkovic's words, [this calls for a "**new ontological
understanding** of the global politico-juridical space]{.underline}"
that "[approximate the inclusion and representation of 'everything
considered to be non-human]{.underline}".22) In speculating polar legal
imagination, we therefore argue that the [Arctic and Antarctic regions
are not]{.underline} merely as amalgamates of geographies [subjected to
**climate** **change** and **geopolitical contestations** but as
**conceptual spaces** where the traditional notions of sovereignty,
legality, and normativity are now unfrozen and set adrift in the open
sea of speculative jurisprudence]{.underline}. In this space,
**[speculation]{.underline}** becomes a [creative endeavour]{.underline}
that [seeks to articulate, enact]{.underline} **[visions of
coexistence]{.underline}** and justice that [are attuned to the
specificities of the polar ecologies]{.underline} and histories and seek
**[new paths for legal]{.underline}** **[theory]{.underline}** and
[practice in a **collective reimagining** of what law can and should be
in a broader planetary context.]{.underline}

Critical Polar Jurisprudence -- The Way Forward

To conclude, the aim of this article is to show that prefigurating and
speculating our collective normative futures in the polar regions
requires a commitment to facing planetary politics. [The space is wide
open for legal speculation in polar law; not only as a means to
rethinking legal norms and epistemological practices]{.underline}
(although to some extent it is necessary) but as a means to
[speculate]{.underline} the kind of [future we truly want]{.underline};
[identify]{.underline} and create [relationships as a **community of
planetary care**]{.underline}. At the heart of prefiguration lies a
(re)centring of justice that is not enclosed and bound by state modes of
existence. [Speculating for the polar oceans means turning our thinking
both onto microscopic and planetary concerns as part of relationalities
and deep entanglements]{.underline}. In this context, speculating better
and more just futures for the polar regions potentially means not
thinking about the polar regions in isolation and as a one-fit-all
discipline. It invites the need for polar law scholarship to embrace a
myriad of disciplines. Next year, we hope to launch the Critical Polar
Jurisprudence (CPJ) initiative at both the annual Polar Law Symposium
and the Critical Legal Conference, respectively. We invite you to join
us in summoning visionary alternatives for the legal frameworks
governing the poles.

The Arctic in the Anthropocene

[Non-Indigenous people,]{.underline} such as myself, [who will always be
profoundly on the outside when studying the Arctic,]{.underline} must
**[develop new ways]{.underline}** of thinking about the region that
[eschew the dichotomy of wilderness/civilization,]{.underline} which
seems to lead inextricably to the othering of the peoples and
environments of the Arctic. [Vibrant theories and methodologies that
center the experience]{.underline}, [knowledge, and imaginations of
Indigenous people are absolutely essential if we are to avoid
scholarship, policy making, and artistic work]{.underline} that at best
**[reifies pre-existing outsider imaginaries]{.underline}** of the
[region and at worst totally **excludes Indigenous voices** from a
position of knowledge creation]{.underline}. As well as looking to the
field of postcolonialism and scholars such as Bhabha and Spivak, another
burgeoning area of research that certainly breaks from the wilderness
mindset is posthuman studies. At its core it is an area of research that
seeks to disestablish the centrality of the human subject from how we
view the world, promoting a more ecological way of thinking, situating
the scholar as one of many lifeforms in the complexities of the
Anthropocene.

Drawing on Timothy Morton's research, I would suggest that we can view
the Arctic as a 'hyperobject', or something that is "massively
distributed in time and space relative to humans" (Morton 2013: 1).
Similar to Morton's example of climate change as a hyperobject, the
Arctic is a huge-scale, confusing, massively distributed social,
cultural and political space that is imagined as a single entity. In
reality it is a jumble of legal frameworks, state territories,
Indigenous homelands, ecologies, visual representations, ice, water,
land, and many other things that confound the simplicity of the term
'the Arctic' and which "involve profoundly different temporalities than
the human-scale ones we are used to" (Morton 2013: 1). Ultimately, the
field of posthuman studies grants new ways of conceiving of the Arctic,
which seek to overcome the limitations of an ontology that is
human-centric and, along with this, refute the notion of the Arctic as
strange, exotic, other and 'outside'. Such posthuman perspectives that
emphatically refute a singular modernist perspective can totally
reposition scholarship and art away from the limiting dichotomy of
wilderness/civilization, because wilderness is entirely a human
construction.

We are [living through a time]{.underline} of strange contradictions,
standing in the [crosscurrent of multiple crises]{.underline}. [Social,
political, cultural, and ecological webs are fragmenting]{.underline},
the prospect of a more complete collapse seems ever closer. Sometimes
our individual work with patients may seem futile given what's going on
outside our consulting rooms, yet we necessarily hold on to the belief
that what we do matters, each individual mind. The p[syche needs healing
on all levels, and sometimes paying attention to the smallest details
are just what is needed]{.underline}, as the [ripples fanning out from
the tiniest changes]{.underline} can at times prove the most
transformational[. Why are we **unable to act** even when our survival
depends on it]{.underline}? Whole regions of the planet are burning up
in flames or sinking into the sea, and [we find ourselves in a
generalized **psychosocial breakdown**, a madness within which it is
increasingly hard to think]{.underline}. This paper aims to attempt to
join the dots between psychoanalytic and post-psychoanalytic
perspectives in relation to climate change and the ecological crisis and
to begin a discussion on the role of joy in sustaining ourselves in the
face of the global catastrophe.

Can psychoanalysis help us now to 'think under fire' (Bion), and does
psychoanalysis also need to look beyond itself? There is an expanding
psychoanalytic literature addressing itself to climate change and the
ecological crisis (e.g. Dodds 2011, 2021; Hoggett 2019; Jordan 2009;
Lertzman 2015; Randall 2009; Searles 1972) which has been very helpful
at exploring the fantasies, anxieties, defences, destructiveness, etc.
around environmental crises, but so far little has been written about
the role of joy, not just in relation to climate change but in general,
a lack I find striking. In this paper I wonder whether this may be a
missing thread we now need. [We are living in a new epoch in which
humans have become a geological force]{.underline}. The [Anthropocene is
accompanied by fractures and systemic collapses, ruptures and
disruptions on many]{.underline} [levels]{.underline}:
**[climate]{.underline}**, **[ecosystems]{.underline}**, **[social
systems]{.underline}**, **[psychological systems]{.underline}**, with
**[nonlinear feedback loops]{.underline}** leading to [complex
interactions and systemic flows]{.underline}, some of which are
**[dangerously self-amplifying]{.underline}**. In my book Psychoanalysis
and Ecology at the Edge of Chaos (Dodds 2011), I argue for an engagement
with Deleuze and Guattari, complexity theory, and ecology as a way to
make sense of these complex connections.

The human-nature relation

I will begin with a brief review of [philosophical positions concerning
the relationship]{.underline} between humans and the rest of nature.
First, [humans see themselves as 'masters of the world']{.underline},
above it, **[dominating]{.underline}**, **[subduing]{.underline}**,
**[apart from, and separate]{.underline}**. This [anthropocentric
narcissism]{.underline} has clearly [played a large role in **creating
the current crises**]{.underline}, and [functions as an omnipotent
**defence against helplessness** in the face of the superior power of
nature]{.underline} (Freud 1927), the [global pandemic again reminding
us]{.underline} of just [how fragile our social]{.underline}
[systems]{.underline} actually [are]{.underline} in the face of
environmental changes. Second, this [view]{.underline} has [been
challenged by both deep ecology and ecopsychology]{.underline} with
their vision of a primary union between [humans and nature
shattered]{.underline} by **[traumatic
separation/disconnection]{.underline}** which thus offers a healing
promise of reconnection. I see this as, at times, leading to an
[eco-mysticism]{.underline} -- [**oceanic fantasies** of
oneness]{.underline} that [not only deny the very real]{.underline}
[differences between humans and non-human]{.underline}, but also
[accepts too much difference in assuming a primal rupture in need of
being overcome]{.underline}. Third, 'post-humanism' and the 'new
materialism' lead us to an acceptance of castration, acknowledging both
the limits of human power and that we are not (and never were) as
special as we think we are. However, I argue that [the Anthropocene
requires a further **shift**]{.underline}. Just as [omnipotence is a
defence against helplessness, '**helplessness'** can be a **defence
against omnipotence.**]{.underline} We are not powerless but have
[immense power]{.underline}, yet without knowing either how to act or
control it, like a toddler with a machine gun. There is an [irony to the
fact that post-humanistic challenges to our narcissism arrived just when
we became an active planetary force]{.underline}. Is there a way to
acknowledge this power without returning to the grandiosity that got us
into the mess in the first place? The fact that we are deeply woven into
the ecological mesh doesn't mean that our actions are absorbed
effectively by it.

In his book Chaosmosis, [Guattari]{.underline} (1995) called for a
generalized science of ecosystems or ['ecosophy']{.underline}, with
'[resonances, alliances and feedback loops between various
regimes']{.underline} (p. 91). In The [Three Ecologies]{.underline}
(2000) he develops this [further]{.underline}, exploring the
interconnected [spaces of natural ecology]{.underline}, [social
ecology]{.underline}, and [mental]{.underline} [ecology]{.underline}. I
argue that even the [word]{.underline} '**[environment']{.underline}**
is [itself part of the problem]{.underline}, making us [imagine a stable
**reliable backdrop** like a stage in the theatre, in front of which
'real' human life and **history takes place**]{.underline}. This
[foreground-background distinction]{.underline}
**[collapses]{.underline}** when we realize how enmeshed we are, and how
fragile the 'fixed' backdrop really is. Timothy [Morton]{.underline}
(2008) [suggests]{.underline} not only that this [stable background is
lost,]{.underline} but that [we need to mourn the fact that it was
**never there to begin with,**]{.underline} that the [very idea of a
stable background is part of the problem]{.underline}, and that we need
an 'ecology without nature'[, a 'dark ecology'.]{.underline} From my
perspective, [ecology is simultaneously the strongest
justification]{.underline} for moving beyond psychoanalysis and why,
despite everything, [psychoanalysis is needed now more than
ever.]{.underline}

Ecopsychoanalysis and climate change

[Psychologically]{.underline}, various [developmental levels intersect
with]{.underline} our [**problematic relationship** with
nature]{.underline}. The phrase ['(m)other Earth']{.underline} suggests
that our experience with the planet relates to the (m)other of infancy.
Following Klein, this [includes not only feelings of love and being
held]{.underline}, but also rage, envy and [destructiveness, and
phantasies]{.underline} of an infinitely giving Earth-breast that we
feel entitled to suck on without limit. In the greed ([one-person
psychology), envy (two-person), and jealousy (three-person) triad of
Klein]{.underline}, we are mainly [still stuck with a greed]{.underline}
that does not even recognize our dependence on the other, the Earth, or
even the existence of that other. Our species is in the situation of an
infant unable to tolerate weaning, where the breast is not only a
provider of nutrition, but a place where we expel unbearable states of
mind (Meltzer 1994). [**Climate change** evokes the **persecutory
anxieties of Klein's paranoid-schizoid position**,]{.underline} leading
to **[omnipotent defences]{.underline}** [to protect against feelings of
helplessness and fragmentation]{.underline} (Jordan 2009).
[Defences]{.underline} against depressive anxiety include the difficulty
in acknowledging human culpability and guilt, and they [interfere with
our capacities to deal with loss and mourning.]{.underline} Drawing on
Freud's (1916) concept of **[anticipatory mourning]{.underline}**,
individuals [and societies may adopt positions of consciously not
caring]{.underline} [about the environment or even their]{.underline}
[survival]{.underline}, or become **[actively destructive]{.underline}**
**[and self-destructive]{.underline}**, as a [defence against the
mourning yet to come]{.underline}. Alternatively, we [fall into
premature despair, preventing the action which might avoid the feared
loss.]{.underline} At the phallic-Oedipal level, on the other hand,
Searles (1972, p. 364) [identifies phantasies of eliminating Oedipal
rivals]{.underline} (including **[future generations]{.underline}**) and
[notes]{.underline} the '[moralistic' tone of **ecological
writing**]{.underline} involving the projection of Oedipal guilt, the
rape of Mother Earth. Furthermore, through relentless advertising,
possessions such as cars become symbols of genital achievement so that
initiatives to reduce [pathological consumerism]{.underline} can feel
like castration (Randall 2005), [one of the **many psychological
barriers to effective change.**]{.underline}

Such [defences]{.underline} [against]{.underline} what is now [called
eco-anxiety]{.underline} [involve unconscious alliances created socially
through]{.underline} [interactions]{.underline} **[at all
levels]{.underline}** giving [rise to **social phantasy
systems**]{.underline}. These [individually and socially
structured]{.underline} [defences can be viewed as
assemblages]{.underline} that emerge through self-organization, where
lower levels interact to form higher level structures [embodying
emergent properties which feedback to lower levels in a
process]{.underline} [of ongoing **recursivity**]{.underline}.
Complexity science studies how biological systems tend to occupy the
edge of chaos, the [fractal borderzone between stability and instability
providing maximum ecological flexibility and the most fruitful ground
for emergent pattern formation]{.underline}. In mental ecology, Palombo
(2007) shows how small pieces of insight in psychoanalysis self-organize
into ever larger structures. The same applies to the emergence of
'self'. For Deleuze and Guattari (2005), [larval subject and partial
objects self-organize into]{.underline} [assemblages]{.underline} with
emergent properties both [below and above the traditionally conceived
human subject,]{.underline} [including human and non-human
elements]{.underline}, organic and inorganic elements, **[both material
and representational.]{.underline}** In the [psychoanalytic
encounter]{.underline} we might [imagine an ecosystem of the physical
and non-physical, of living and non-living parts, of past and future, of
dream and word]{.underline}, of sweat on skin, fold on cushion, falling
leaves, a [gasp of insight]{.underline} [as]{.underline} a 'selected
fact' emerges, slight changes in breath, [thoughts on the extinction of
a species ...]{.underline}

How can we process this? [What changes in our psychoanalytic conceptions
when **we imagine that the 'we'**]{.underline} [**doing** the processing
includes various parts]{.underline} (both human and non-human) [in
temporary connections and exchanges?]{.underline} Can Bion's move from
PS to D include non-human or even non-living parts and couplings,
comparable to the way that the self-organizing eco-mental system
(Bateson 2000) of a termite mound includes both living and non-living
components? [Opening up to this way of thinking we might
understand]{.underline} [that our sense of our capacities as
humans]{.underline}, [including our experiences of joy]{.underline},
could be **[enriched]{.underline}** [through]{.underline} such
[heterogeneous assemblages and productive couplings]{.underline}.
**[Psychoanalysis]{.underline}** itself can be understood as a
'[destabilization']{.underline} of what Busch (2007) [calls pathological
infantile attractors in the coevolving ecosystem of]{.underline}
[analyst and patient]{.underline}, and while most change is confined to
the local level and absorbed by wider defences, as the [system reaches
self-organized criticality the tiniest local shift can precipitate
cascades of disorder and subsequent reorganization throughout the entire
system.]{.underline} Such **[dynamic models]{.underline}** of change are
[crucial]{.underline} for [understanding psychological]{.underline} and
**[social]{.underline}** **[shifts]{.underline}** in response to
ecological crisis. [Periods of **instability** are]{.underline}
**[natural stages]{.underline}** on the path [towards greater
self-organization]{.underline}, but without guarantee that what emerges
will be better (even our idea of what 'better' means can dynamically
change[). Complexity theory helps us understand how psychological,
natural, and social ecologies are organized, and how fragile they can
be]{.underline}. The [task]{.underline} then **[becomes an experimental
search]{.underline}** for 'lever [points' to open up the possibilities
of radical transformation.]{.underline}

Animal becomings and joy

I have previously argued (Dodds 2012) that animality is a crucial area
where these intersections can be explored. The '[animal' returns us to
the clinical origin of psychoanalysis]{.underline}, the rat man, the
wolf man, and Little Hans' horses, as well as to Freud's writings on the
origin of religion and civilization and Jung's on the mythic dimension.
[Deleuze and Guattari (]{.underline}2005) [distinguish between 'Oedipal'
animals (]{.underline}domesticated pets), which we can [relate to
Guattari's 'mental ecology']{.underline}, 'State' or mythic animals
(e.g. the British Lion, the American Eagle) which can be [related to
Guattari's 'social ecology']{.underline}, and 'nomadic' or wild (pack)
animals which are [related to his 'natural ecology'.]{.underline} The
**[ecopsychoanalytic]{.underline}** [perspective]{.underline} I have
been developing suggests it is helpful to see the [three ecologies as
in]{.underline} [constant]{.underline}, [complex non-linear interaction
with one]{.underline} [another]{.underline}. Whenever we are discussing
one or two of them we should wonder what is happening to the other. [For
example, how does an 'idea' **emergent out of the mental system**
**impact** on an ecosystem or **social system?**]{.underline} How does a
[phantasy affect biodiversity and vice versa]{.underline}? How does a
microscopic organism expelled in a sneeze in China shut down the Venice
Carnival (Dodds 2020)? [Our fantasies about animals tell us something
about ourselves,]{.underline} and about [human relationships with the
non-human other]{.underline}, but they also have **[real effects on that
other]{.underline}**, [via interactions with social ecology and natural
ecology.]{.underline}

Deleuze and Guattari's **[geophilosophy]{.underline}** helps us [move
from 'becoming-animal' to 'becoming-ecological']{.underline}, opening up
to **[heterogeneous relationships]{.underline}** and [becomings in
trans-individual and sub-individual webs of connectivities.]{.underline}
As well as individual and social meanings, the animals in both our
dreams and art [reflect the effects of ecological crisis]{.underline},
the Earth dreaming through us. [I see the (human) ecological self as
being **infiltrated by and plugged into wider ecological networks** in a
process with **potentials for joy as well as anxiety**.]{.underline} The
[depressive ambivalence]{.underline} offered by
[psychoanalysis]{.underline} can be [expanded through Deleuze and
Guattari's]{.underline} (neo-Spinozian) geophilosophy, with more
[open]{.underline} connections to the [non-human world and the specific
forms of joy]{.underline} that this makes possible. [We need a **space
for joy** in these times]{.underline}. **[Dancing while the world burns?
Is]{.underline}** this possible? [Can we still have pleasure
today]{.underline}? What is the '[normal' we are going back to
'post'-COVID in the context of accelerating climate and ecological
meltdown?]{.underline}

In addition to terrible suffering, the [global COVID pandemic has much
to teach us in the context of]{.underline} [climate change]{.underline}
(Dodds 2020), it's a kind of trial run. For many, the [lifting of
restrictions of lockdown]{.underline} and the command to [return to
normal life]{.underline} has been an experience as
[traumatic]{.underline} as the lockdown itself. Some felt a kind of
[safety in retreating from the world]{.underline} (for those lucky
enough to have homes safe from eviction). Many felt they [lost what
social skills]{.underline} they had during this time and don't know how
to go about [restarting connections]{.underline}. If the '**[normal' was
never normal,]{.underline}** then to what should we return? We are
living with [considerable anxiety and confusion around the pandemic, our
relations to one another, and to our threatened ecological
systems.]{.underline} There are also many confusing feelings around joy.
I think that many of us have forgotten how to really enjoy ourselves,
especially when the [consumerist superego commands us to 'enjoy!' in
individualized forms]{.underline}, which [only make us feel]{.underline}
more [anxious]{.underline} and guilty (Žižek 2009).
[Lockdowns]{.underline} around the world ended the collective experience
of live music and this was felt as a terrible loss by many. [In the
presence of so much death and pain, and while a **terrible war is raging
in Ukraine** and when **ecological systems themselves**]{.underline} are
[collapsing]{.underline}, it may sound trivial to be worried about
dancing to the beat of a song[. Are we allowed to enjoy ourselves
anymore in the face of the existential threat of climate change, or of
spreading infectious diseases?]{.underline}

A place for joy and music

I think we need to find a place in the conversation about climate change
for [social joy,]{.underline} for the intense connection that music and
other forms of pleasures can bring, especially now. [Ecopsychological
writings]{.underline} (see Mary-Jayne Rust 2020 for an essential
overview) have [explored]{.underline} the **[oceanic
feeling]{.underline}** of [loss of ego-boundaries that can occur in
liminal experiences in natural spaces]{.underline}, as the boundaries
[between self and the more-than-human world merge.]{.underline} Marion
Milner (2010) describes a similar experience, both wonderful and
terrible, in relation to the artistic process. These experiences can be
[profoundly healing]{.underline}. There is also much overlap with
Winnicott's (2005) concept of play and how central this is to life and
to our work as therapists, something that we seem to be forgetting.
Music experienced together in passionate collective movement releases an
enormous amount of pent-up feeling, emotion, pain, love, sadness, and
also joy. For Deleuze and Guattari:

Music is never tragic, music is joy. But there are times it necessarily
gives us a taste for death; not so much happiness as dying happily,
being extinguished. Not as a function of a death instinct it allegedly
awakens in us, but of a dimension proper to its sound assemblage, to its
sound machine, the moment that must be confronted, the moment the
transversal turns into a line of abolition. Peace and exasperation.

(Deleuze & Guattari 2005, p. 299, italics in original)

[But can we allow ourselves to dance in this time, is it not dangerously
selfish and irresponsible]{.underline}, a [denial of
trauma]{.underline}? What about a whole generation of young people who
have been deprived of those first magnificent experiences of finding
themselves and each other over the shared generational moment they are
living through and embody?

[Psychoanalysis]{.underline} likes to talk about ambivalence but, in
practice, [this often means putting an emphasis on the 'hidden' dark
side that's being repressed.]{.underline} However, it should also mean
allowing the **[hidden light to shine]{.underline}**. Tragedy can be
clung to as a defence against the comic, just as much as the other way
around, as the novels of Milan Kundera demonstrate so well. [After all,
tragedy has]{.underline} [much to offer which comedy lacks: certainty,
nobility, finality.]{.underline} Freud's (1905, 1919) description of the
uncanny and the comic are remarkably similar (e.g. dolls, body parts
that move by themselves, uncertainty as to whether something is alive or
an automaton, eyes popping out, etc.) and they can be seen as
essentially implicated within each other (see here Bakhtin's \[1984\]
comic-grotesque 'grave-womb').

[Guilt and shame over dancing while the world burns can understandably
paralyze us.]{.underline} My view is that the [environmental movement
has a problem with guilt and shame]{.underline}. It is often perceived
(partly due to wider societal projections of repudiated guilt onto
activists, see Randall \[2005\]) as being joyless, calling us to
[renounce all pleasures as selfish in the name of defending the future
of the Earth.]{.underline} This is one of the obstacles for the wider
social transformation we require if we are to survive. [We need spaces
of collective joy within the **struggle against climate** **change**, of
possibilities for euphoria and experiences of **imminent
transcendence.**]{.underline}

Bion's (1989) concept of alpha-function and beta-elements is important
in the context of art. The [world can be understood as experiencing an
overload of beta-elements]{.underline}, undigestible fragments -- both
the physical and psychological toxic by-products of our
industrial-growth society -- [with many of our cultural and political
containers failing their work of psychological digestion]{.underline},
leading to system-wide breakdowns and fragmentation. One of the crucial
roles for art, including music, is that it allows a [cultural working
through of undigested beta-elements, a kind of psychological
composting,]{.underline} so that **[fragments can be reused,
developed,]{.underline}** and made a part of other cycles and flows.
[Music]{.underline} contains a rich tapestry of emotional resonance, a
thousand cries of pain and pleasure, creating temporal [collectivities
that ripple through time, space, and dreams]{.underline} (Nagel 2013;
Rose 2004). In Listening Subjects, Schwarz (1997) describes two key
features of music, music as 'sonorous envelope' (drawing on Bick's and
Anzieu's concept of psychic skin), including the enveloping oceanic
feeling of music where the boundary separating body from world
dissolves, and music as 'acoustic mirror'. Schwarz points out that,
despite being the talking and listening cure, psychoanalysis prefers
visual metaphors rather than auditory, [which is ironic since the
musical dimensions of language predate and underpin the emergence of the
linguistic register]{.underline}. For Mauro Mancia (2006), it is the
musical dimensions of the transference that connect us most directly to
the early unrepressed unconscious.

A joyful ecopsychoanalyis?

I argue that we need today to [develop a psychoanalysis of
joy.]{.underline} Winnicott once wrote, in a parody of psychoanalytic
interpretation, that:

one is at a music-hall and on to the stage comes dancers, trained to
liveliness. One can say that here is the primal scene, here is
exhibitionism, here is anal control, here is masochistic submission to
discipline, here is a defiance of the superego. Sooner or later one
adds: here is LIFE. Might it not be that the main point of the
performance is a denial of deadness, a defence against depressive 'death
inside' ideas?

(Winnicott 1935, p. 131)

Deleuze and Guattari, in A Thousand Plateaus, seeking an approach to joy
beyond Lacan, Freud, Klein or Jung, write that:

There is, in fact, a joy that is [immanent to desire as though desire
were filled by itself and its contemplations]{.underline}, a [joy that
implies no lack or impossibility]{.underline} and is not measured by
pleasure since it is what distributes intensities of pleasure and
prevents them from being suffused by anxiety, shame, and guilt.

(Deleuze & Guattari 2005, p. 155)

There are many paths to joy. The masochist, for example 'uses suffering
as a way of constituting a body without organs and bringing forth a
plane of consistency of desire. That there are other ways, other
procedures than masochism, and certainly better ones, is beside the
point; it is enough that some find this procedure suitable for them'
(ibid.).

Searching on PEP-Web, I found only 58 references with 'joy' in the title
in the whole psychoanalytic literature (and about a third of those refer
to authors called 'Joy'!). Such a central emotion, and psychoanalysts
with so little to say about it? For Heisterkamp (2001) joy is
complementary to anxiety (and there's certainly no lack of writings on
anxiety in the psychoanalytic literature), with the former representing
successful restructuring, a new beginning, and the latter a failure of
structuring. Given the intensity of anxiety about climate change --
which we need to feel so that the energy used in our defences against it
can be employed to more effectively deal with the threat we face (Dodds
2021) -- and the urgent need for psychological, social and ecological
restructuring, there needs to be space for joy to oppose terror, just as
Bakhtin (1984) described as one of the key purposes of carnival.
Heisterkamp (2001) describes joy as a basic form of 'resonance', from
the child seeing herself reflected in the gleam of mother's eye (Kohut
1971, p. 16), to the implicit goal of psychoanalytic treatment to
(re)discover the joie de vivre, reminding us of Winnicott's emphasis on
aliveness. In his review of the psychoanalytic literature, Heisterkamp
found only three reference to joy in the general index of Freud's work,
and none at all in Jung's, which is extraordinary. How could they have
missed something so vital?

[Heisterkamp argues that this has extended to the wider psychoanalytic
literature,]{.underline} amounting to something of a taboo against joy,
which is terribly limiting as: 'joy lies at the pivot of psychic
transformation, where the scope of psychic self-articulation and
self-regulation expand. Joy is the feeling of self-discovery, of new
beginnings (Balint 1968), and of restoration of the self (Kohut 1977)'
(Heisterkamp 2001, p. 858). Joy is inhibited by fear, insecurity,
trauma, shame, and guilt. Joy may also be avoided due to a fear of a
loss of control, or a loss of the prestige of being serious (although
both Freud and Winnicott knew that play was very serious). Joy can serve
several functions in the analytic session, which certainly include that
of defence, collusion, and resistance, but it can also offer powerful
moments of relational resonance over the shared humanity (I would also
add animality) of analyst and patient (Biancoli 2002), affirming
uniqueness (Buechler 2002), of excitement over developmental progress
(Heisterkamp 2001), and a sense of a shared lived experience of this
moment (Stern 1998). In a future paper I would like to further explore
the differences and overlaps between collective, dyadic, and individual
forms of joy, and the joy involving complex assemblages including
non-human and non-living components, with music as rhizome connecting
and constituting collectivities.

Searles (1972) [suggested that the way in which our society is failing
to react to ecological crises reflects a sense that there is 'something
so unfulfilling about the quality of human]{.underline} life that we
react, essentially, as though our lives are not worth fighting to save'
(p. 365). There is therefore an [urgent need in these times of
environmental crisis to allow ourselves to experience joy, with
its]{.underline} [simultaneous affirmation of both our uniqueness and
togetherness]{.underline} (not only as humans but with all forms of
life) as analysts, patients, as activists, and as a species sharing this
world with our fellow living creatures. There is [joy and revelry in
feeling our connection to the web of life itself]{.underline}, and the
possible new assemblages it allows us to form. We need to [develop a
deeper psychoanalytic]{.underline} [approach to joy and find out what
stands in its way]{.underline}. Dancing at the end of the world? Let's
hope the music will go on for a little while longer at least[. Perhaps
then, if]{.underline} we [**were to allow ourselves** to actually
**enjoy** our lives, we just might **fight harder against our
extinction.**]{.underline}

As Bennett (2010) argues, while [ecosophy neither privileges the
ecocentric]{.underline} nor the [anthropocentric]{.underline}, it
nevertheless [creates]{.underline} a necessary [emphasis]{.underline} on
'the [agentic contributions of non-human forces]{.underline} ([operating
in nature]{.underline}, in the human body, and in human artefacts) in an
attempt to [counter]{.underline} the [narcissistic reflex of human
language and thought']{.underline} (p. xvi). [Ecosophy]{.underline}
[enunciates]{.underline} and enunciates-differently the [assemblages of
materialities]{.underline}, [social institutions and
practices]{.underline}, and [ideologies]{.underline}, and also provides
a critical [lens on current practices]{.underline} in the school [which
tend to elide the variable and]{.underline} [connected assemblages at
play]{.underline}. [Ecosophy]{.underline} [focuses on
**newness**]{.underline}; the [creation of newness]{.underline} that
**[happens]{.underline}**---and needs to happen---[in all registers of
life.]{.underline} It focuses on a **[new type of
politics]{.underline}**, [identity formation, and activism that
articulates both **unity and difference**]{.underline} toward [newness,
experimentation **away from capitalism**]{.underline} and other
consumeristic tendencies.

[Ecosophy]{.underline} makes a [particularly salient
intervention]{.underline} in that it [pushes against both
neoliberalism's]{.underline} [focus on the responsibility of the
individual]{.underline}, and [current educational policy's
championing]{.underline} of an **[economistic and technocratic view of
education]{.underline}**. Where [neoliberalism focuses on the
individual]{.underline}, [ecosophy focuses on the
interconnections]{.underline}, tensions, and [overlaps of assemblages
that create and re]{.underline}-[create never-fully-created
wholes.]{.underline} Where current educational [policy]{.underline}
[advocates]{.underline} for **[measurement]{.underline}**, known
**[strategies]{.underline}**, and **[scripts]{.underline}**, **[ecosophy
advocates for experimentation and newness.]{.underline}** Ecosophy makes
a [critical case for being sceptical and even pushing against current
discourses around creating 'efficient' and monetarily independent
schooling entities.]{.underline} [Ecosophy]{.underline} moves toward
**[new]{.underline}** **[subjectivities]{.underline}**, assemblages, de-
and re-territorialisations that [are flexible, dynamic, open,
rhizomatic, and multiple.]{.underline}

[Ecosophy resists becoming a 'recipe' for '**correct'** **pedagogical
practice**]{.underline}, but [it still can offer us a more **radical
understanding of problems,**]{.underline} inter-dependencies, and the
[possibility for change when compared to many of the pedagogies in use
in schools]{.underline}. More can be done to use ecosophy as a way to
understand the world in all of its dynamic and connected assemblages,
[and more can be done, perhaps, to use ecosoph]{.underline}y---[even if
only as a **critical lens** focused on current pedagogies---**within the
site of the school.**]{.underline}

[Ecosophy]{.underline}, as a term, has [not only been used by
**Guattari**]{.underline}. For example, the term
'[ecosophy']{.underline} was first [coined by Arne
**Naess**]{.underline} (1973/2010). However, as John
[Tinnell]{.underline} (2011) [points ou]{.underline}t, [Naess's
conception of]{.underline} [ecosophy]{.underline} is **[quite
different]{.underline}** [from that put forward by
**Guattari**]{.underline}. Writes Tinnell: 'At a fundamental level, the
mission of Naess's ecosophy is to expand the sphere of objects with
which people identify' (2011). In other words, for Naess, ecosophy is
about a deep personal commitment to and responsibility for the
environment. One comes to identify with nature in order to preserve it.
For [Guattari, ecosophy instead involves a subjectivity instantiated as
a **process of coming together** with other parts of nature]{.underline}
(human and nonhuman) that [create assemblages of identity, materiality,
and practice]{.underline}. Guattari is [concerned with **remaking
ontology** as an assemblage of materiality, social practices, and the
ideological or mental capacities.]{.underline}

One of the [positions that marks **Guattari** as different from
**Naess**]{.underline}---[and from other scholars concerned]{.underline}
with [sustainability or environmental preservation]{.underline}---is the
[desire to avoid privileging any one]{.underline} [position]{.underline}
or [stance]{.underline}. According to **[Tinnell]{.underline}**,
[Guattari's ecosophy]{.underline} insists that the [world is 'a dance
between chaos and]{.underline} [complexity]{.underline}---a multitude of
**[productive syntheses]{.underline}** between nomadic parts that exist
independent of any fixed structure or transcendental whole' (Tinnell,
2011). For [Guattari]{.underline}, not only is there a [push against
hierarchy, but there is also a]{.underline} foregrounding of
[dynamism]{.underline}. There are [times when materiality and
the]{.underline} non-[human are privileged as shaping powers within the
world,]{.underline} but also times when human and global politics are
pinpointed as shaping powers. That is to say, [Guattari's ecosophy
positions both the human]{.underline} and [nonhuman as actants;
both]{.underline} have the **[capacity]{.underline}** to **[act as
subjects, objects]{.underline}**, and **[somewhere
in-between.]{.underline}** Guattari's **[ecosophy]{.underline}** aims
[toward instability]{.underline}---[instability of
identity]{.underline}, of [relationships]{.underline}, of connections,
of 'knowns'---in order to [create space for something new
and,]{.underline} hopefully, [less enmeshed]{.underline} [within a
predatory **capitalism**]{.underline} that has already colonized many
current forms of life.

[Guattari]{.underline} [argues that **all registers of life** are
**interconnected**]{.underline}; that the [production of material
artefacts]{.underline} are [connected with **social and cultural
production;**]{.underline} that our world is produced through the
interaction of discourse, human practice, and materialities. In this
way, Guattari's work finds affinity with philosophers like Walter
Benjamin (1968), Martin Heidegger (1971) and Henri Lefebvre (1992), who
also examine the connections between culture, practice, and
materialities. [Ecosophy insists on valuing and examining the **material
world**, **technology**, **artefacts**, and the ways that things can
both shape and be shaped by humans.]{.underline} Akin to the work of
scholars such as Donna Haraway (1991), Katherine Hales (1999), and
Roseanne Alcuquere (Sandy) Stone (2001), [Guattari's ecosophy
advocates]{.underline} for an analysis of the [blurred lines between
humans and machines,]{.underline} people and their environments. [The
relationships of human and machine have bearing on the **wider natural
world** and **institutional environments** in which we
live.]{.underline}

## K\-\--Securitization

#### The aff's narrative construction is not neutral. Usage of hyperbolic rhetoric and painting of the "enemy" and glorification of war is the exact messaging Russia uses to justify it's war in Ukraine.

苗

When it comes to [constructing strategic narratives]{.underline},
[Russia might be among the most successful]{.underline}
[actors]{.underline} in the world. [Moscow's messaging regarding the
ongoing war in Ukraine]{.underline} has been aggressive not only
outwards, but also inwards. The [Kremlin has been adamant in its
messaging about]{.underline} [Ukraine]{.underline} being the [**biggest
evil** for the **continued legitimacy of the full-scale
invasion**]{.underline} to continue[.]{.underline} Albeit authoritarian
regimes like that of [Vladimir Putin do not necessarily rely on public
support]{.underline}, they do [require **sustenance of the ideological
appeal** of the war]{.underline}. This includes delivering a
[hand-crafted]{.underline} [message]{.underline} to the peoples of the
north. Because [the people living in the Russian Arctic]{.underline} are
quite [isolated]{.underline} from the rest of the world, [communication
with them needs to be specifically constructed]{.underline} in a manner
that makes them [perceive the imminent **danger** Putin wants all people
in Russia to feel.]{.underline}

Strategic messaging can be done in many forms, [and nowadays most
messages get delivered through the internet, specifically social
media]{.underline}. For communities that are more secluded, social media
is not always the best form of messaging to reach them. [In short, this
means that traditional media still plays a significant part in the
construction of Russian Arctic narratives]{.underline}. This can be done
through national news outlets, just like it can be carried out using
regional media. While we cannot distinguish which narratives are meant
for the peoples of the Russian Arctic, and which ones are meant for the
general population if they are communicated through national agencies
like 'TASS', if we shift our attention to regional outlets like
'Vechernij Murmansk' or 'Sever Post', we can [observe]{.underline}
[which narratives]{.underline} are [prominent]{.underline} when
communicating specifically to the people living in the Russian Arctic.
[The reason for picking both news outlets is because they are from the
Murmansk region, they are producing articles intended solely
for]{.underline} the consumption of [the people living in the
region.]{.underline} There are not many news outlets that specifically
focus on the Russian Arctic that operate an online platform. Most of the
information produced for the peoples of Russia is generated through
massive platforms like 'TASS', or 'RT', yet, the focus on the smaller,
regional, entities offers this article a source of materials that are
only intended for a very specific audience, as it is created in Russian
-- thus -- for Russophones, and, in small regional outlets -- thus --
for the people living in the Russian Arctic.

To briefly describe the methods used to create this article, the term
'Ukraine' was searched for in the corresponding websites of both of
these news outlets. It was done using a VPN to access these sites in the
first place, and then search engines were used to identify concrete
examples. [Using a qualitative method -- content analysis, relying
heavily on keyword search approach,]{.underline} [concrete
articles]{.underline} were [pinpointed]{.underline}. When the keywords
were identified, the specific article was analyzed, thoroughly reading
it, and confirming the general sentiment of the article. This method
does not completely eliminate the possibility of subjectivity, however,
content analysis provides a systematic framework for the qualitative and
quantitative exploration of textual data, enabling researchers to
identify recurrent patterns and thematic structures. [This rigorous
approach facilitates a nuanced]{.underline} [understanding of underlying
meanings and contextual significance within large datasets.]{.underline}
Complementarily, keyword search functions as a targeted retrieval
mechanism, enhancing the efficiency of data processing by isolating
instances of specific terms or phrases. [This focused retrieval
streamlines the analytic process]{.underline}, allowing researchers to
concentrate on relevant segments of text. The search was done in
Russian, to ensure that the information is intended for the Russophone
population of the Russian Arctic, not the international audience that
might be following the media. [Due to the scope of this research, a
short timespan was selected -- just the first 8 months of
2024.]{.underline} It might correspond to some specific events, thus,
this research could be expanded in the future, to eliminate that
possibility.

In both highlighted news outlets combined, the term
'[Ukraine']{.underline} [appears]{.underline} in [31 articles
throughout]{.underline} [2024]{.underline}. This suggests that if you
are a local consuming material from the aforementioned outlets, you will
[encounter roughly 3.5 articles about Ukraine a month]{.underline}. This
is a significant number of articles about a sovereign country more than
2200 kilometers away, especially considering these regional outlets
produce just a couple of articles per day. In [the majority of these
articles, **Ukraine is** **portrayed poorly**, specifically made to look
weak and inferior, accenting their need for Western
support]{.underline}. Ukraine's [territorial integrity is not
respected]{.underline}, on several occasions [articles **glorify** the
events of **illegal territorial occupation**]{.underline}, justifying
them in the eyes of the reader. To add to this, articles about 'Crimea',
'Lugansk', and 'Donbas' have been published 97 times, signifying to the
reader that these are legitimate parts of Russia[. Thus, if we count
these keywords, we can understand that these regional outlets actually
produce 128 articles per month about Ukraine.]{.underline} It is
important to signify that there might be other keywords that were not
sought due to the scope of this article, for example, other regions of
Ukraine, like regions, cities, and villages, likely indicating that
there is significantly more material than accounted for if one just
searches for 'Ukraine'.

Another recurring phenomenon is the [characterization of **Russia as a
savior,** spotlighting]{.underline} the [hate]{.underline} [children
saved from the region feel for Ukraine,]{.underline} sometimes even
going as far as to [not recognizing]{.underline} [Ukraine as a
legitimate state]{.underline}. This **[demonizes the
Ukrainian]{.underline}** **[state]{.underline}**, making it see[m like
the war is **inevitable**]{.underline} and even
**[justified]{.underline}**. This is also the reason why the term
'special operation' appears in 69 articles, highlighting that the [mere
existence of the Ukrainian state is being questioned,]{.underline} as
they do not mention that this special operation takes place in an
internationally recognized sovereign state. Again, if we add these to
the total sum, we get a total of 197 articles within the span of 8
months, or \~25 articles per month. These are not amounts that aim to
overwhelm -- these are amounts that are aimed to slowly impact the
general populace's understanding of the war, specifically regarding the
existence of Ukraine as a legitimate state.

To further radicalize the locals, [several articles portray the dangers
that Ukraine is bringing to the]{.underline} [Arctic]{.underline} --
spying is a [recurring narrative while poisoning the locals with Western
propaganda]{.underline} is also not forgotten. [To reinforce the fear of
the state,]{.underline} these articles usually [end by underscoring the
harsh]{.underline} [punishments enemies of the state face,]{.underline}
almost always coining the perpetrators Nazis.

Despite that most articles focus on making [Ukraine seem weak, and
Russia strong]{.underline}, the authors also do not forget about the
Arctic identity of the reader. None of the articles specifically mention
USA or other allies of Ukraine like Poland, rather they focus on other
Arctic states, highlighting how Norway, Sweden and Finland interact with
Ukraine. [These narratives specifically regarding these states seem to
be built to establish that these Arctic state]{.underline}s are helping
Ukraine not because Russia is attacking it, but rather they are
competing with Russia in the Arctic realm. There is not an abundance of
these articles. However, the fact that they are writing about Arctic
Nordic states, and not states that aid Ukraine outside of the Arctic
seems to indicate that there is underlying reasoning behind this.

An additional observation is how some articles mention Ukraine directly
(31), and a second set of articles that talk about Ukraine, without
mentioning it directly. In these, the outlets are discussing selected
regions in Ukraine (97), or, describing the 'special military operation'
(69). While this could be a research topic of its own, it is worth
highlighting that there is a large amount of information we can retain
from this observation.

Evidently, the [local media outlets are **delegitimizing the existence
of Ukraine**]{.underline}, [positioning]{.underline} it to be an
[illegitimate state]{.underline}. It aligns with [Putin's narrative that
this is not a war]{.underline}, it is a special military operation.
Thus, it [indicates that by 'not writing about Ukraine',
the]{.underline} local [media outlets are]{.underline} [portraying a
'silent narrative'.]{.underline} By them not mentioning it, [we can
acknowledge the general sentiment regarding the state]{.underline}. It
is crucial to highlight the fact that there are hundreds if not
thousands of terms that could have been sought for when commencing this
analysis. Thus, it is impossible to argue about the true extent of the
narratives that are being pushed upon the peoples of the Russian Arctic.

To conclude, there is [a clear difference in how regional media outlets
communicate in the Russian Arctic, and how the national outlets
communicate to the general population.]{.underline} While the general
outlets highlight how Germany and the USA are helping Ukraine, the local
ones from the Arctic region are circling out Arctic states like Norway,
Sweden, and Finland. While the general message seems to align both for
the general population and those living in the Russian Arctic, on many
occasions, articles seem to be trying to bring the war closer to home
for those living in the Russian Arctic, reinforcing a sense of urgency
and danger for these individuals.

Meanwhile, exaggerated violence is accelerated in the larger society and
now rules screen culture. The public pedagogy of entertainment includes
extreme images of violence, human suffering and torture splashed across
giant movie screens, some in 3D, offering viewers every imaginable
portrayal of violent acts, each more shocking and brutal than the last.
[The growing taste for violence can be seen in the increasing modeling
of public schools after prisons, the criminalization of behaviors such
as homelessness that once were the object of social protections. A
symptomatic example of the way in which violence has saturated everyday
life can be seen in the growing acceptance of criminalizing the behavior
of young people in public schools. Behaviors that were normally handled
by teachers, guidance counselors and school administrators are now dealt
with by the police and the criminal justice system]{.underline}. The
consequences have been disastrous for young people. Not only do schools
resemble the culture of prisons, but young children are being arrested
and subjected to court appearances for behaviors that can only be termed
as trivial. How else to explain the case of the five-year-old girl in
Florida who was put in handcuffs and taken to the local jail because she
had a temper tantrum; or the case of Alexa Gonzales in New York who was
arrested for doodling on her desk. Even worse, a 13-year-old boy in a
Maryland school was arrested for refusing to say the pledge of
allegiance. There is more at work than stupidity and a flight from
responsibility on the part of educators, parents and politicians who
maintain these laws; there is also the growing sentiment that young
people constitute a threat to adults and that the only way to deal with
them is to subject them to mind-crushing punishment. Students being
miseducated, criminalized and arrested through a form of penal pedagogy
in prison-type schools provide a grim reminder of the degree to which
the ethos of containment and punishment now creeps into spheres of
everyday life that were largely immune in the past from this type of
state violence. The governing through crime ethic also reminds us that
we live in an era that breaks young people, corrupts the notion of
justice and saturates the minute details of everyday life with the
threat, if not reality, of violence. This mediaeval type of punishment
inflicts pain on the psyche and the body of young people as part of a
public spectacle. Even more disturbing is how the legacy of slavery
informs this practice given that "Arrests and police interactions ...
disproportionately affect low-income schools with large African-American
and Latino populations,"(26) paving the way for them to move almost
effortlessly through the school-to-prison pipeline. Surely, the next
step will be a reality TV franchise in which millions tune in to watch
young kids being handcuffed, arrested, tried in the courts and sent to
juvenile detention centers. This is not merely barbarism parading as
reform -- it is also a blatant indicator of the degree to which sadism
and the infatuation with violence have become normalized in a society
that seems to take delight in dehumanizing itself.

Building on Debord's pioneering critique, a number of theorists have
developed a better understanding of how the spectacle itself has
changed, particularly in light of the emergence of new mass and
image-based media technologies. Douglas Kellner, in particular, has
written extensively on the notion of the spectacle and concludes, in
agreement with Debord, that the spectacle of late capitalism has
essentially taken over the social order. Building on these important
interventions, [what concerns us today are the ways]{.underline} in
which mainstream [media and]{.underline} popular
[[culture]{.underline}]{.mark} typically **[[sensationalize
violence]{.underline}]{.mark}** ([from]{.underline} the large-scale
[catastrophe]{.underline} [to]{.underline} individual
[assault]{.underline}) [in a way that]{.underline}
**[[drains]{.underline}]{.mark}** from such events [any viable ethical

precisely [the]{.underline} [alienating]{.underline} cultural,
[social]{.underline}, and political [climate achieved

**[incapacitate]{.underline}** political responses that are in any way
off-message from the ever-narrowing grid of tolerable responses to
authority and its enforcement. This understanding of the problematic
allows us to propose the following critical definition that will inform
the rest of the book: [The spectacle of violence]{.underline} represents
more than the public enactment and witnessing of human violation. It
[points to a]{.underline} highly mediated **[regime]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} **[suffering]{.underline}** and misery, which brings
together the discursive and the aesthetic such that the performative
nature of the imagery functions in a politically contrived way. In the
process of occluding and depoliticizing complex narratives of any given
situation, [it assaults our senses in order to]{.underline} **[[hide
things in plain sight]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [The spectacle works by
[turning]{.mark} human [suffering into a]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[**spectacle**, framing]{.underline}]{.mark} and editing

### 2AC\-\--No Root Cause/Turns Case

#### "Root cause" and "serial policy failure" are [theoretical malpractice]{.underline}. Drive lacks [causal force]{.underline}.

**Kornbluh, 23**---Professor of English at the University of Illinois,
Chicago (Anna, "We Didn't Start The Fire," Parapraxis, Issue 3, December
2023, language modifications denoted by brackets, un-underlined portions
reference self-harm dml)

[For]{.underline} a radically interdisciplinary and interprofessional
consensus---**[psychoanalysts]{.underline}** and philosophers,
sociologists and cultural critics, journalists and
lawyers---[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} signifier "death
**[[drive]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [ferries a **compulsively repeatable
[explanation]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}]{.underline} climate
[catastrophe]{.underline}. [Why are we forcing
**[extinction]{.mark}**?]{.underline} [Because]{.underline}, according
to both lay analysis and high theory, meme-able headlines and academic
symposia, [there is so much **enjoyment**]{.underline} in the unholy
convergence of best-practice aggression and the growth imperative of
extractive capitalism.

Speaking of enjoyment, [the very **repeatability** of this explanation
suggests that its satisfactions are **manifold**]{.underline}. It is of
course essential to make sense of the senselessness around us. Yet the
sense here is a little too enjoyable. Like all psychologisms, [it
furnishes the abject succor of **exoneration**]{.underline}: [we
**simply cannot help it**]{.underline}, it is our nature to annihilate
nature. In the face of the oft-extolled sublimity of climate
crisis---its scale and severity, its complexity and
uncognizability---death drive as cause domesticates and rationalizes:
this is why we do it. And up against the speculative, inconsistent
strangeness of the death drive, this prevailing mantra magnetically
assures: drive means. Positivized aggression in the final solution of
heat-seeking destruction. Downright irresistible.

To cut to the chase: [this]{.underline} ubiquitous warming nugget of
contemporary discourse [[commits **theoretical
malpractice**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[Psychoanalysis]{.underline}]{.mark} is understandably resurgent in the
quivering void of explanations for rampant immiseration, but the popular
front [should not **misframe** its fundamental concepts]{.underline}.
The death drive is a theoretical construct, Freud steadfastly insisted,
a "limit concept" at the limit of conceptuality, figuring limits to
thinkability and consciousness, corporeal borders, and the divide of
nature/culture; its liminality and speculativeness court misuse,
especially the misuse of taming its wild. One such subdual is this tony
settling [of]{.underline} the death [drive as **cause**]{.underline}.
[Taking]{.underline} the death [drive as a cause of]{.underline} the
climate [catastrophe [is wrong about
**causality**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [both **politically** and
**libidinally**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Mass psychology is **not
responsible** for]{.underline} carbon modernity's
[devastations]{.underline}. And [[the death drive is **not a
program**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

There are therefore two corrections to make, the first political and the
second psychoanalytic. Not corrections for correction's own sake, for
schoolmarm rectitude, but to percuss the gratifications of this double
mistake. So, OK, schoolmarm kinkshaming. It is evidently enjoyable [[to
believe that humanity is]{.underline}]{.mark} killing itself \[[[causing
extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}\] [[on **purpose**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
It [[offers]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[consolation]{.underline}** of
our competence, [[**exculpations** of]{.mark} our
[inaction]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} ultimately the
[**reassurance** that]{.underline} enjoyment is efficient, that [drive
is]{.underline} in the last instance not a disturbance in the order of
being, but efficient **[manifest destiny]{.underline}**. We should
question this enjoyment, and as partisans of a renaissance of
psychoanalysis, we have a responsibility to traverse it.

On the political point, we can say quite simply that the [masses of
people]{.underline}---especially those who are already dying, but up to
and including those who, on average, suffer only
#firstworldproblems---[are **not responsible**]{.underline} for carbon
modernity, [and to suggest that they are is an **egregious obfuscation**
that **debilitates mass mobilization**]{.underline}. Carbon capitalist
autocracy, a highly specific and contingent mode of resource management
and power monopoly, is the cause. Many historians and geologists deem
the post-1950 intensification of the human imprint on the earth system
of physical, chemical, biological, and human processes "the great
acceleration." This acceleration tracks closely with the dramatic
decline in top income tax rates and statutory corporate tax rates
globally. It also tracks with the oil companies' own scientific
conclusiveness about anthropogenic climate change. They know it, and
they are doing it. The average billionaire emits one million times more
carbon than the average person living in the bottom 90 percent; this is
not only lifestyles of private jets and yachts and eight houses, but
also the aggregate emissions of their investments---in the mere one
hundred companies that have been responsible for more than 70 percent of
global emissions over the last fifty years. The average fossil-fuel
executive is not ignorant of the lethal impact of their actions, but
hews to the rational calculus that if they do not profit, someone else
will. And these colossal untaxed emitters and wanton oligarchs have in
the same timeframe consolidated outsize influence over politics, media,
and the rule of law. Political leaders cannot champion drawdown, public
infrastructure, or corporate accountability when they are themselves
owned by the oil industry; journalists cannot represent the truth when
they have been downsized, outsourced, and automated; courts cannot
adjudicate rights and freedoms, injury and remedy, when they are only
corrupt kangaroos.

These [[clear **causes** mean]{.mark} there are some [clear
**solutions**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Don't believe]{.mark}
the]{.underline} "**[[it's complicated]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
[mantra]{.underline} of Latourian ecocriticism, [[because **it's
simple**]{.underline}]{.mark}: cutting the carbon footprint of the
world's wealthiest people is the fastest way to reach net zero. No more
Exxon Mobil and BP, no more billionaires, no more private planes, no
more private senators, no more oil; yes more taxation, yes more pipeline
sabotage, yes more lowlands mutual aid, yes more federalized
decarbonization and centralized resource redistribution. Yes, [this
[simplicity **falls short of**]{.mark} **communist
[revolution]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[But]{.mark} it would **[ameliorate
vast suffering in the]{.mark} looming [present]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[Psychologizing]{.underline}]{.mark} ecocide [**[rules out]{.mark}**
even those modest remedies]{.underline}.

Psychologizing the death drive, for its part, is an error perhaps
invited by the rends of ambiguity in Freud's speculations, or the
lurching rhythm of all his efforts to inscribe it, including its
maladroit name. Alas, that the drive is not a program has not stopped
proper [psychoanalytic]{.underline} clinicians and
[theorists]{.underline}---among them Freud's own students---from turning
it into one. Many [have **smoothed the lurches** in drive theory
by]{.underline} empiricizing it, [grounding the abstract category in
**content**]{.underline}: aggressive symptoms (negative therapeutic
reactions, violent thoughts and acts, death wishes) or even more generic
expressions like affects of hatred, envy, or spite. While Freud himself
at times made recourse to the odd behavioral example or destructive
wish, his fundamentally speculative theory defies those runaway
thematizations. [When violent phenomena demand explanation]{.underline},
[it is **only remotely** from the clinical context and **rank with
ideology** that the drive answers]{.underline}.

Death drive as explanation for ecocide logically must be levied in
general terms: humanity is the virus, we are destroying the planet---and
if it comes to the world without us, then nature is healing. In his
prominent essay "Death Drive Nation," Blanchfield parries this false
generality with another one by excepting "America" from humanity.
American pandemic attitudes, he argues, distinctively offer "an object
lesson and exercise in the death drive": "the death drive is visible in
aggressiveness, in physical violence, self-destruction, and
self-sabotage . . . the terrain of the death drive is about severing
ties, breaking things to pieces, and even suicide . . . a nation founded
on a continent decimated by settler plagues, cleansed by genocidal war,
and fructified by chattel labor unsurprisingly . . . \[operates\] a
starkly differential calculi of exposure to premature death, workplace
risk, and general immiseration . . . this is the logic of the death
drive, distilled and accelerated, to which we cling all the way to the
very bitterest of ends." The [**original sin** rhetoric]{.underline}
abundant in so many contemporary approaches to American history
[is]{.underline} here [**gilded** with a **teleologizing** of psychic
life]{.underline}. This country wishes for death, the heart wants what
it wants.

[But the workings of the unconscious are **not quite that
orderly**]{.underline}, and even Amerikkka is a tale of two cities in
carbon form. [The pleasures of painting]{.underline}
"**[America]{.underline}**" [tout court as aggressive plague outweigh
the basic fact that **we didn't start the fire**]{.underline}---[and it
is **grossly exculpatory** to incant that we did]{.underline}. [America
is **not homogenous** economically]{.underline},
[ideologically]{.underline}, [or even libidinally]{.underline}. It is
filled with people who struggle tirelessly against autocracy, or who
abide poverty similar (by major wellbeing indicators like life
expectancy, infant mortality, and risk of homicide) to countries with a
tiny fraction of the U.S.'s per-capita economic output---or who do both
at the same time and have for generations. Where America is exceptional
is as the world's largest oil producer and simultaneously the least
representative of democracies; purposely and functionally antidemocratic
institutions like the Electoral College, localized election laws, the
Supreme Court, dysregulated campaign finance, criminalized protest, and
militarized policing cow those struggles.

[In the pretense of facing a bedrock psychic truth]{.underline}, [the
pervasive]{.underline} death drive [thesis operates as a **defense**
against the real]{.underline}: a dissimulation of class antagonism. And
embedded in this political error lurks a psychoanalytic error, a
misprision of drive. If the ideological distortion in this death drive
thesis vindicatingly grafts the particular ecocidal social class onto
the universal subject of the drive, [the libidinal distortion
**gratifyingly represses** the fact that the [drive]{.mark} itself
**[cannot operate as a cause]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The **pervasive
theoretical malpractice** of psychologizing ecocide as]{.underline}
purposive [drive accords **new swank** to psychoanalysis]{.underline},
[but that comes at the price of **illuminative interpretative
power**]{.underline}.

For its proponents, as we have seen, drive is the effective curriculum
of destruction. But in psychoanalysis, it is something else entirely.
Right away, at the very beginning, the death drive emerges in Freud's
thought as this something else: as he contemplates the mass death event
of World War I, the question that propels him as an already established
inventor of a new science is not "'What caused this great violence' but
'How does traumatic loss constitute the subject?'" In Beyond the
Pleasure Principle, Freud finds a psychic inclination not for death, but
against it---a repression of mortality, a fantasy of heroism, a will to
revisit trauma in order to sublate it, a wish not to die. Shell-shocked
veterans, with their recurrent symptoms, present not wish fulfillment
but the lack of wish, a void where desire magnetically stirs without
object. For a different sort of thinker, the Great War context might
readily have inspired the psychologism we have seen in the contemporary
ecocidal death thesis, but Freud stood vigilant against psychologisms.
Where there is widespread insistence that we wish for our own death,
there is surely repression. And repression, the non-reckoning with the
gap in being and the discontent in culture, is the starting point for
psychoanalytic intervention, not its outcome.

Of course that reckoning is enormous, catapulting the science of
psychoanalysis toward its most speculative domains. Thus did Freud avow
in "Anxiety and Instinctual Life" that "the theory of the drives is, so
to speak, our mythology. The drives are mythical entities, magnificent
in their indefiniteness." [The very signifier]{.underline}
"**[drive]{.underline}**" [marks]{.underline} the magnetism of [what is
**unspecified**]{.underline}, the undertow of the unknown. Can the
practice in the clinic broach or tether the abstract cosmos that is its
subject? Mythology is in the room with us---the necessary fabulation of
the unconscious. [Drive theory is]{.underline} the
**[metafabulation]{.underline}**, sketching the kinesis of the
indefiniteness. In this the theory reflects its object, for, in the
words of Tracy McNulty, "the ungivenness of the death drive" engenders
"the corresponding need to substantiate or construct it." Drive is not a
positivity.

Such not-ness---[drive's [negativity]{.mark}]{.underline} as it
were---[[**constrains** it from materializing as]{.underline}]{.mark}
the unarrested progress of [[annihilation]{.underline}]{.mark} imagined
by the compulsive consensus on ecocide. Paradoxically, the movement of
the negative also constrains the drive from absolutist negativity of the
sort promulgated by celebrated antidialectical accounts of the drive.
Supposing drive as "antisocial," a "radical refusal of meaning," a pure
"emptiness" devoid of temporality, Lee Edelman's conceit founds the
theoretical malpractice in our present, for to posit drive as "the
unintelligible's unintelligibility" requires repressing that the
negative cannot self-identically engorge. Drive is constantly at odds
with itself, a movement of non-immanence that defies instantiation,
including instantiation as absolute defiance, in one direction.

Through this dynamic rather than static negativity, drive circles around
but does not willfully pursue an object. Freud underscores this
generative detour in figuring drive not as line but as short circuit:
Kurzschluss, an aperture and excess. To the drive, the object "is
strictly speaking of no importance. It is a matter of total
indifference," as Lacan, quoting Freud, defines. Radically objectless,
drive is not bullet-journal attainment of a wish. On the contrary, drive
is goal-obstructed or zielgehemmt---variable, contingent, and evincible
only in its vicissitudes. [[If there is a wish to]{.mark} return
to]{.underline} a prior state of [[inanimacy]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[we
are]{.mark} **pretty [bad at fulfilling that]{.mark}
wish**]{.underline}. What is drive but the topology of failing that
return? What is life but the accumulation of the failure to die?
[The]{.underline} death drive ecocide [thesis **represses**]{.underline}
all this failure, obstruction, indirection---all this
[life]{.underline}---[and takes pleasure in a **fantasized facility** of
the unconscious behind an **imagined immutability** of]{.underline}
climate [calamity]{.underline}.

### 2AC\-\--Psycho False

#### Psychoanalytic explanations of behavior are either [wrong]{.underline} or [unfalsifiable]{.underline}---[conscious]{.underline} choice determines behavior.

**Newell and Starks, 23**---Professor of Behavioural Science in the
School of Psychology at UNSW Sydney; Professor of Psychology and Deputy
Dean of the Faculty of Brain Sciences at University College London (Ben
and David, "Reclaiming the Science of the Mind," Open Minded: Searching
for Truth about the Unconscious Mind, Chapter 1, pp. 10-12, dml)

The modern fields of psychology and psychotherapy have not been
particularly kind to Freud's views, often regarding psychoanalysis as a
pseudoscience.14 But it is worth distinguishing between his conception
of the unconscious on the one hand and his empirical methods on the
other. Today we tend to regard dream interpretation as akin to
storytelling: [[the psychoanalyst]{.mark} provides an
[interpretation]{.mark}]{.underline} of the dream in terms of
psychoanalytic theory, [but [since]{.mark} this is necessarily done
**[after the fact]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [such interpretations [are
**untestable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The [**hallmark** of]{.mark}
scientific [theories is]{.mark} their ability to make]{.underline}
potentially **[[falsifiable predictions]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[something that [psycho]{.mark}analysis [**struggles** to
do]{.mark}]{.underline} ([and even when it does]{.underline}, [[they
**rarely emerge in credit**]{.mark} when tested]{.underline}). None of
this means that the concept of the unconscious is itself incoherent,
although modern conceptions of the unconscious are rather more general
than those accepted by Freud. For example, we have no difficulty today
in accepting the possibility of unconscious perception, in which events
and objects in the environment around us can in theory influence our
behavior even when we are unaware of them (as in subliminal perception).

[Reportable]{.underline}, [conscious states seem to underlie **many** of
our decisions and behaviors]{.underline}. To state the obvious,
[[we]{.mark} often [do things because we have **conscious
reasons**]{.mark} for doing them]{.underline}. This may seem trivial but
is nonetheless worth dwelling on, not least because many influential
schools of thought---most notably behaviorism---have been deeply
skeptical about drawing straightforward links between conscious reports
and behavior. Some of this skepticism is partly justified. For example,
we need to be very careful about the reactive effects of verbal reports:
the very act of giving a description of our mental states may change
those states.15 However, modern theories and methods make an emphatic
case for the importance of conscious knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes
in determining behavior.

[This is exemplified in the theory of planned behavior]{.underline}
(**[TPB]{.underline}**), one of the most influential and truly deep
theories in all of the behavioral sciences.16 [[TPB offers a]{.mark}
**deceptively [simple]{.mark}** [explanation]{.mark} for why we act as
we do]{.underline}. It says that [[only **two** things
matter]{.underline}]{.mark}: [our [**intentions** and]{.mark} our
**[control]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [When we have a **strong intention**
to engage in a behavior and perceive that we have **control** over that
behavior]{.underline}, [then **we will do it**]{.underline}. [Take
**smoking cessation** as an example]{.underline}: [people who intend to
give up smoking and perceive that they have control over whether they
smoke will give up]{.underline}, [whereas those without either the
intention or the perception of control]{.underline} (or both) [will
not]{.underline}.17 The theory in addition says that [[intentions come
from]{.mark} **three** sources]{.underline}. First, we are very strongly
influenced by **[[subjective norms]{.underline}]{.mark}**, our
internalization of the views of other people whose opinions matter to
us. If your partner's views matter to you and your partner takes a dim
view of your smoking, you're more likely to form the intention to give
up. Second, [our **[attitudes]{.mark}**]{.underline} to the behavior are
important. The better you feel about giving up smoking, the more likely
you are to form the intention to give up. Finally, [your estimation of
[how **easy** or **difficult**]{.mark} it will be]{.underline} to give
up will also influence your intention. This sense of control is the same
factor mentioned above: it is assumed to have a direct impact on
behavior as well as an indirect impact via intentions.

According to TPB, it is [**only** these factors]{.underline}, [and **[no
others]{.mark}**]{.underline}, that [[matter]{.underline}]{.mark}. You
might object, for example, that surely personality matters. Aren't
extroverts less likely to quit smoking than introverts? The theory
doesn't deny that such factors could be associated with giving up
smoking, but it says that the only pathways by which they can do so are
via subjective norms, attitudes, or perceived control. Thus, if
extroverts do indeed struggle to stop smoking, it must be because they
feel less pressure from other people's views, or they have a less
favorable attitude to stopping smoking, or they do not feel they have
adequate control.

The precise details of the theory are not crucial; what matters is that
[[the theory]{.mark} is **eminently testable**]{.underline}
([and]{.underline} indeed it [[has survived]{.underline}]{.mark} more or
less intact despite [[**thirty years** of]{.mark} extensive
[testing]{.mark}]{.underline}) and that [all its ingredients are
**conscious**]{.underline}, [**reportable aspects** of
behavior]{.underline}.18 When researchers set out to test the theory,
they do so by constructing questionnaires comprising many items, all of
which attempt to measure different aspects of the person's subjective
norms, attitudes, and perceived control. Each item (such as Most people
who are important to me think I should give up smoking in the next 12
months) is accompanied by a rating scale on which the respondent
indicates their agreement or disagreement with the statement, and the
different items under each type are averaged to give a single measure of
the three predictors for that person. Then an analysis is conducted to
determine whether those individuals with strong subjective norms,
attitudes, and perceived control for quitting smoking are indeed more
likely to quit. Clearly, the questionnaires elicit conscious, reportable
beliefs and attitudes; [this]{.underline} is a theory that fundamentally
[attributes behavior to a combination of **fully conscious**
factors]{.underline}. [The theory]{.underline} could be supplemented by
additional unconscious factors, though these would of course have to be
measured by some means other than explicit reports (the implicit
association test, discussed at length in chapter 5, would be an
example). What is remarkable is that TPB [has achieved]{.underline} the
[explanatory successes]{.underline} that it has even
[**[without]{.mark}** the addition of [**unconscious**
factors]{.mark}]{.underline} (the jury is still out on whether there are
domains in which such factors would extend its power even more).

Final remarks

Without a defined target domain, [the metaphorization of psychoanalytic
concepts allows every psycho analyst to create his/her "individually
chosen array of metaphor]{.underline}" (Wallerstein, 2005, p. 102).
Wallerstein′s "scientific metaphors" lead to a situation in which
"admitted metaphors \[which\] have no specific content can be filled in
to suit one's fancy" (Nagel, 1959, p. 41). [When psychoanalysis presents
individual conceptions in the form of general metaphors, it promotes
what Kubie (1975, p. 14) has criticized as "sources of fallacies" and
the danger Freud (1912, p. 117) once warned his colleagues of, namely
"of projecting outwards some of the peculiarities of his own
personality, which he has dimly perceived, into the field of science,
**as a theory having universal validity**]{.underline}."

As the informational content of Wallerstein′s "scientific metaphors" is
zero, since [there are no absent concepts on which the majority of
psychoanalysts have agreed, care should be taken to ensure that
"psychoanalytic theory ... is freed from this plague of metaphorical
language, which has been **mistaken for scientific
theory**]{.underline}" (Kubie, 1975, p. 14).

I end by indicating that following Kubie's criticism does not
necessarily mean that closure and coherence will disappear from the
psychoanalytic community. The realization of his intention simply
demands that we do not exhaust our tolerance in accepting mutually
exclusive concepts, but anchor it firmly in a common search for truth,
remind ourselves that [Freud (1933, p. 156) did "not want to
commend\[psychoanalysis\] to your interest as a method of treatment but
on account of the truths it contains" and accept "that there is more
than one way to seek the truth" (]{.underline}Jurist &Orfanos, 2016, p.
S3).If we were to familiarize our selves with Freud's recommendation, we
would be obliged to pursue truth as the goal guiding our search for
knowledge, and to regard conceptual pluralism as a field in which we
continue to seek truth in solidarity in differing conceptual views.

#### Psychoanalysis is totally false. Even if it's not, it's pretty much useless.

[Sigmund Freud]{.underline}, 80 years after his death, is
[still]{.underline}, arguably, the [most well-known name in
psychoanalysis]{.underline} in the world. [Considered the father of
modern psychology]{.underline}, his theories and ideas on the
connections that exist between the conscious mind, the subconscious
mind, the body, and the world around us are still as widely known as
they were when he first espoused them at the turn of the 20th century.
However, as we have had, now, a century-plus of building off of Freud's
theories, how relevant are his ideas with what we now understand about
both the human mind and the way in which we can (and maybe should) go
about treating the illnesses contained within it? Are the foundations of
psychoanalysis that Freud established still the foundations that modern
psychotherapy should be built off of, or do his ideas lack the nuance
that modern mental health care and analysis demand?

**[Freud Is an Outdated Fossil]{.underline}**

It's [important]{.underline} to [remember]{.underline} that
[psychoanalysis is about revealing deeper insights into a person's
psyche,]{.underline} and this is **[vastly different]{.underline}** from
how we view the **[modern methodology]{.underline}** and usage of
psychoanalysis and psychotherapy. Especially for those working in the
field and engaged in the process itself, the [idea of]{.underline}
[basic id/ego/superego breakdown]{.underline} and dream analysis are
**[deeply simplistic techniques]{.underline}** and ideas [that will **do
little** in the way of addressing the issues that modern mental health
care exists to address.]{.underline}

Many of [Freud's methods]{.underline}, [techniques]{.underline}, and
[conclusions]{.underline} have been [put into question,]{.underline}
even to the point where some of his [theories]{.underline} have even
become **[viewed as damaging]{.underline}**---and even dangerous---[to
certain segments of the population, such as his views on homosexuality
and women.]{.underline}

The [trouble with Freud]{.underline} is that, [while his ideas appear
intriguing and even appeal to our common sense]{.underline}, there's
**[very little scientific evidence to back them up.]{.underline}**
Modern [psychology]{.underline} has [produced]{.underline} very [little
to support many of his claims in the decades since their initial
presentation.]{.underline} For instance, there's no scientific evidence
in support of the idea that boys lust after their mothers and hate their
fathers. Also, there's [**no proof of the id, ego, or superego**, and
their respective aspects of control over the human psyche,]{.underline}
much as we still like to use those terminologies today.

And this is [just a small sampling of his theories and **ideas that have
been debunked** in the decades since their presentation.]{.underline}

Freud is Still Relevant, But Only as a Reference Point

[Freud's legacy has transcended science]{.underline}, with his ideas
permeating deep into Western culture. As psychologist and Freud critic
John Kihlstrom himself admits, "More than Einstein or Watson and Crick,
more than Hitler or Lenin, Roosevelt or Kennedy, more than Picasso,
Eliot, or Stravinsky, more than the Beatles or Bob Dylan, Freud\'s
influence on modern culture has been profound and long-lasting."

But, [Freud has, for the most part, **fallen completely out of favor in
academics**]{.underline}. Simply put, [no one taking]{.underline}
[psychology seriously would use him as a credible source.]{.underline}
In 1996, [Psychological S]{.underline}cience reached the conclusion
that, "[There is literally nothing to be said, scientifically or
therapeutically,]{.underline} to [the advantage of the entire Freudian
system or any of its component dogmas.]{.underline}\" **[As a research
paradigm]{.underline}**, it's pretty much **[dead.]{.underline}**

But wait, how does that mean he's still relevant? Well...

Freud was absolutely correct in his assertion that we are not masters of
our own mind. He showed that human experience, thought, and deeds are
not exclusively driven by our conscious mind, but by forces outside our
conscious awareness and control---ones that we could eventually
understand through the therapeutic process he called, "psychoanalysis."
Today, very few would argue against the idea of the unconscious mind,
and Freud's claim for the central role of the unconscious mind in human
actions is as relevant to psychology today as it was then (see the
following collection of essays called Frontiers of Consciousness).

[Freud also argued]{.underline} for the idea that the [brain can be
compartmentalized,]{.underline} that brain function can be broken down
into individual parts. His take on this, of course, was **[incredibly
primitive]{.underline}**, [as Freud mostly spoke of the ego, id, and
superego---ideas **we don't really accept any more,**]{.underline} as
mentioned above. But, his [larger]{.underline} [thesis]{.underline} of
psychic compartmentalization has gone to [influence such thinkers as the
cognitive scientist Marvin Minsky, who talks about the society of
mind.]{.underline}

As well, Freud\'s take on defense mechanisms still holds relevance. Few
people, including psychologists, would deny that we all too regularly
employ such defenses as denial, repression, projection,
intellectualization, and rationalization. The same can be said for his
ideas on transference and catharsis. And though we no **[longer
subscribe to Freudian dream interpretation]{.underline}**, some of our
dreams are so blatantly driven by our conscious and subconscious desires
and fears that it's obvious Freud was onto something with that idea,
too.

[Ultimately, Freud's modern **contributions apply more to attitudes**
than any actual therapeutic methods,]{.underline} though this is not a
bad thing. He established foundations that modern mental health care are
built off of, and the modern attitude of those engaging in the mental
health care process certainly seem to stem from his main thesis
statement as to what patients should be getting out of therapy, which,
simply put, is, "Know thyself."

#### Triune brain model is false, and all theories based in it are wrong.

[Theory impacts how research is conducted]{.underline}. An
[influential]{.underline} [theory]{.underline} used to [conceptualize
brain function]{.underline} and drive research has been the **[triune
brain theory]{.underline}** (1--4). The triune-brain approach to
understanding the brain takes an evolutionary perspective about how the
brain has developed under environmental pressures and how that
development impacts our responses, particularly our responses to stress.
Describing the triune-brain theory, MacLean (3) states that:

The [human forebrain]{.underline} [evolved]{.underline} to its great
size while [retaining features of three basic formations]{.underline}
that reflect an [ancestral relationship to reptiles]{.underline}, early
mammals, and recent mammals. The [three neural]{.underline}
[assemblies]{.underline}... are radically different in structure and
chemistry, and in an evolutionary sense, countless generations apart.
[Psychological and behavioral functions depend on the interplay of three
quite different mentalities]{.underline}. The [three **evolutionary
formations**]{.underline} might be [popularly regarded as
three]{.underline} [interconnected biological]{.underline}
[computers]{.underline}, each having its own [special
intelligence]{.underline}, its **[own subjectivity]{.underline}**, its
own sense of time and space, and its [own memory, motor, and other
functions]{.underline}." (p. 264).

From the [perspective of the triune-brain theory, these three brain
regions]{.underline} evolved separately and function somewhat
independently: the [basal ganglia and brain stem]{.underline} are
involved in movement and [basic life functions]{.underline}, the [limbic
system]{.underline} is involved in [emotional responses]{.underline}
that are seen more prominently in mammals as compared to reptiles, and
the [cortex is involved in cognition]{.underline} and executive
functions and is most prominent in humans. In this perspective,
evolutionary development begins with basic behavioral responses, then
adds emotional responses that can alter these basic responses when
threat or challenges arise, and then adds on cognition to alter
emotional responses using reason, logic, and planning.

There are several [key problems]{.underline}, however,
[with]{.underline} the **[triune brain theory]{.underline}**. First, the
[brain did not evolve in]{.underline} [successive stages]{.underline} as
MacLean hypothesized (5). The idea that vertebrate evolution has
consisted of "newer brain structures being superimposed over and on top
of 'older\' brain structures, tracking development of complex
cognition," is [not evolutionarily justifiable]{.underline} (6). [Basic
neural regions are shared]{.underline} [among all
vertebrates]{.underline}. Where they differ is in proportion and extent.
Just as an elephant\'s trunk is not a new structure superimposed over a
snout but rather is an analogous structure differing in proportion (and
consequently, in functional adaptation to the animal\'s needs), [the
human brain is not superimposed on a reptile brain but consists mostly
of proportionally different analogous structures.]{.underline}
Furthermore, the [gradation of proportional]{.underline}
[shifts]{.underline} is **[not necessarily a linear
progression]{.underline}** from reptile to human (7).

Second, [brain structures do not function independently of one another
(]{.underline}5). During [emotional responses]{.underline}, there is
[activity in the amygdala]{.underline} and in the limbic system, but
there is [also activity in cortical areas]{.underline} and in the
brainstem (8). Additionally, [emotion and cognition]{.underline} are
**[not independent events]{.underline}**; rather, they are [interrelated
functions working in concert.]{.underline} For example, Bush et al. (9)
and Shackman et al. (10) both note that emotional responses and
cognitive responses in the cingulate cortex are interconnected and not
separate as previously believed. [Perhaps more importantly, the limbic
system is not a purely emotional center in the brain]{.underline}.
LeDoux (8) notes that the [hippocampus]{.underline} is considered part
of the limbic system but that it is not considered an essentially
emotional brain region; [instead]{.underline}, it is a key area
[involved in memory,]{.underline} which is more [closely associated with
**cognition**.]{.underline} Because of these and similar problems, the
term "[limbic system" is no longer a commonly used term to describe how
the brain functions.]{.underline} "[Limbic system" also loses its
utility in a clinical setting;]{.underline} because affect is a
culmination of a wide range of interrelated processes, including
synthesis of internal and external stimuli, arousal, and memory,
[approach **to disorders characterized** by affect dysregulation is
**limited** by the triune brain approach]{.underline}. And, finally, the
[brain does not act by simply responding to a stimulus]{.underline}.
Instead, it **[predicts]{.underline}** **[internal and external
needs]{.underline}** and adapts accordingly. [Incoming stimuli interact
with the current state in which the brain is (11).]{.underline}

Third, [current]{.underline} [neuroscience]{.underline}
[research]{.underline} findings [provide further evidence of the
inaccuracy]{.underline} of [triune brain]{.underline}
[theory]{.underline} and open [new ways of understanding]{.underline}
how the brain responds to stress and adapts to changing internal and
external environments. Fear [research provides an instructive specific
example]{.underline}. There is [no]{.underline} [fear brain
circuit]{.underline} that turns on during a fear response but otherwise
lies dormant (8). [Brain networks]{.underline} [always have some level
of activity (]{.underline}12) that affects how they process incoming
information (11). What changes is the [relative activity of different
brain networks,]{.underline} with [networks]{.underline} being
[differentially activated]{.underline} based upon need (13--16). As
these [findings show]{.underline}, [triune-brain theory does not match
current research]{.underline} [findings]{.underline} and **[using
triune-brain theory]{.underline}** as a general theoretical approach
**[can lead to faulty hypothesis creation and poorly developed
studies.]{.underline}**

A more useful evolutionary theory of how the brain works needs to
integrate accurate knowledge of brain structure and function.
Adaptation, survival, and reproduction are at the heart of evolutionary
theory, and interdependent brain networks have evolved to increase
adaptation to be able to survive and reproduce. [Further, emerging
findings suggest that the brain uses interoceptive and exteroceptive
information to predict future conditions and needs to enable optimal
adaptation to continuously changing internal and external
environments]{.underline} (11--20). Based on better understanding of how
the brain works, we propose replacing "triune brain" with a term that
better captures current understanding of brain function: the adaptive
brain. In this conceptualization, the term adaptive brain emphasizes the
interdependence and plasticity of brain regions and the brain\'s ability
to predict and adapt to future needs and conditions. Instead of three
relatively independent brain regions, or any number of independent brain
regions, [brain networks work together interdependently; instead of
purely "emotional circuits" or "cognitive circuits]{.underline}," the
b[rain uses interconnected networks to optimize maintenance of the
body\'s internal state, emotion, and cognition to adapt to continuously
changing needs]{.underline} (11). The brain\'s summated approach to
[these priorities regulates affect, and dysregulation of these
interdependent circuits has important implications for
psychopathology.]{.underline}

Psychology, Vol 48, No. 11,
https://www.apa.org/monitor/2017/12/psychoanalysis-bad-rap. 苗

Why did the treatment get set aside, even disdained, among psychologists
in the mid-1900s? Several factors were at play, says Nancy McWilliams,
PhD, a psychology professor at Rutgers University and author of several
books on psychoanalysis.

For one, in the [1950s and 1960s]{.underline}, the [psychodynamic
approach lost ground because those who were studying and practicing it
were **too dismissive of other methods**,]{.underline} according to
McWilliams.

\"[Psychoanalytic work got to be very prestigious in
psychiatry]{.underline}, and it attracted a lot of people---mostly
white, heterosexual males---[to the field who were **more interested in
obtaining status** as the head of a psychiatry
department,\"]{.underline} says McWilliams.

At the same time, [many psychoanalytic institutes moved out of
university settings]{.underline}, cutting themselves off from broader
intellectual work, and [began including only psychiatrists in their
training there]{.underline}, says Pratyusha Tummala-Narra, PhD, a
professor of counseling, developmental and educational psychology at
Boston College. In [addition, psychoanalytic theorists **did not attend
adequately** to the **need for disseminating research** on the
effectiveness of psychoanalytic psychotherapy]{.underline}, while
studies on **[CBT]{.underline}** and **[other similar therapy
approaches]{.underline}** [showed promising results more
visibly.]{.underline}

No quick fix

[Another turnoff for American psychologists was the method\'s less
optimistic]{.underline}, [more European orientation]{.underline},
McWilliams says. \"Freud\'s belief that psychoanalysis can help people
turn neurotic misery into ordinary human unhappiness doesn\'t fit well
in a culture where we are given to utopian movements and self-help books
and quick fixes,\" McWilliams says. \"[Americans have been ingrained
with the idea that things should be fixable.\"]{.underline}

Also[, unlike Europeans]{.underline}, Americans often
[emphasize]{.underline} the importance of individual
[independence]{.underline}, says McWilliams, and much of
[psychoanalytic]{.underline} theory is about [letting yourself feel
deeply attached]{.underline} to another person---the therapist---and
then seeing what emotions that brings out.

**[Outdated theories]{.underline}**

In addition, in their original form, [many of the constructs that Freud
introduced,]{.underline} such as the Oedipus complex and the idea of
[psychosexual stages,]{.underline} seem [dated]{.underline} and
[peculiar]{.underline} and often do not resonate with people today[,
says Ken Levy, PhD]{.underline}, a [clinical psychology
professor]{.underline} at **[Penn State University]{.underline}** who
maintains a small psychodynamically oriented private practice.

\"When you read some of the secondary sources, such as textbooks, that
mention Freud, it does often seem silly, but many of his ideas have been
integrated into broader psychology, often without sufficient recognition
or credit,\" Levy says.

In 1881, a [young woman]{.underline} in Vienna [discovered]{.underline}
she had [lost her native German tongue]{.underline}. She could speak
nothing but English. Bertha [Pappenheim was diagnosed by her doctor with
hysteria]{.underline}. The symptoms included contractures,
hallucinations, and aphasia ― the [loss of basic functions such as
language]{.underline}. They were [resistant to conventional
treatment]{.underline}; and so Pappenheim became [the first ever patient
of psychoanaly]{.underline}sis. Her name, in one of the **[practice's
foundational texts]{.underline}**, Studies on Hysteria, **[is Anna
O.]{.underline}**

The [original patient of psychoanalysis]{.underline} was [never
treated]{.underline} by the father of psychoanalysis,
[Sigmund]{.underline} [Freud]{.underline}; she was treated instead by
its John the Baptist, Josef Breuer, who co-wrote Studies on Hysteria.
"The discovery of Breuer's," wrote Freud of his colleague in 1917, ["is
still the foundation of psycho-analytical theory]{.underline}". What
Breuer discovered, and Freud later developed, [was that neurotic
conditions could be treated by a "talking cure".]{.underline} By talking
about her childhood experiences to the analyst, the patient can relieve
herself of the disorders that burden her --- and subsequently alleviate,
with the help of the analyst, the physical manifestations of such
disorders.

[Psychoanalysis]{.underline}, then, is [medical treatment by
language.]{.underline} Adam Phillips, one of the leading psychoanalysts
in England, writes that "[Freud was as much, if not more, of writer than
a doctor]{.underline}". Like the [Fin-de-Siècle writers who uncovered
the dark undercurrents of bourgeois conventions]{.underline}, or the
[modernist writers who questioned coherent narratives]{.underline},
Freud was an integral part of the lively intellectual culture that
witnessed the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and much of
continental Europe. And it was [very much a literary
culture]{.underline}.

To briefly psychoanalyse: as a child Freud was gifted at languages,
became familiar with Greek, Latin, Spanish, Italian, French and English.
And yet it was medicine he ultimately studied at the University of
Vienna: as the firstborn son, he wanted to be dutiful and serve his
impoverished family.

Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen, in Freud's Patients: A Book of Lives (out last
month), thinks not[. "Freud's cures were largely ineffectual," he
writes, "when they were not downright destructive".]{.underline}
Borch-Jacobsen **[examines 38 patients]{.underline}** Freud treated in
his 50-year practice, [but his book is concerned less with the efficacy
of psychoanalysis and more with portraying]{.underline}, in selective
but vivid detail, [the individuals Freud treated.]{.underline} "We all
know the characters described by Freud in his case studies," he writes,
"but do we know these illustrious pseudonyms?" His book is "an attempt
to reconstruct the sometimes comical, most often tragic and always
captivating stories of these patients who have long been nameless and
faceless".

Anna Von Lieben, referred to as Cäcilie M by Freud, was his most
important patient for a period of six years, beginning in 1887. She was,
Borch-Jacobsen writes, part of the "Viennese Jewish upper bourgeoisie":
brought up in a palace, where her family hosted Brahms, Strauss and
Liszt. She was treated in Paris by Freud's hero, Jean-Martin Charcot,
otherwise known as the Napoleon of Neuroses. In Vienna, she was also a
patient of Breuer.

Von Lieben was obese. She tried to curb this by following a strict diet
of caviar and champagne. And she was an accomplished chess player: she
liked to play two games simultaneously, and, while she slept, she would
have a chess player on standby near her room in case she woke up and
fancied a game. Perhaps not unrelatedly, Von Lieben had facial neuralgia
and attacks of the nerves. For this, Freud was brought in to treat her.

He was her "nerve doctor". He used hypnosis to purge her of childhood
traumas. [Unlike the talking cure Breuer used on Pappenheim, however ---
in which the patient simply remembers her traumatic experiences --- in
Freud's talking cure the patient is invited "to relive and forget their
traumas]{.underline}". But he also **[gave her morphine]{.underline}**
--- and **[this was what stopped]{.underline}** her neurotic
**[attacks]{.underline}**, [not hypnosis]{.underline}. "The [famous
cathartic cure]{.underline} of Cäcilie M", writes Borsch-Jacobsen,
**["was in fact a morphine cure".]{.underline}**

Her husband, Leopold von Lieben[, "finally decided to end her treatment
with Freud, which had spanned almost six years and had **produced no
lasting improvement".**]{.underline} Anna von Lieben died of a cardiac
arrest when she was 53. Her children referred to Freud as der Zauberer
--- the magician --- who performed worthless tricks on their mother.

(1979), Coburn (2002), Ferro (1993, 2009), Ferro and Basile, (2009),
Katz (2013), and Miller (1999, 2008a, 2008b), [are **consistent** with
the]{.underline} cross-theoretical, perspectival [psychoanalytic
approach]{.underline} presented in the assumptions section above. [These
theories]{.underline} provide coherent models or metaphors that
[encompass the **multifaceted**, **complex dynamism** of the human
mind]{.underline}. And no reason exists to not incorporate the drives
into them. Schmidt-Hellerau (2005) writes, "A psychoanalytic model of
the mind without drives is like a house without people who live in it,
who use and invest in its equipment in a specifically meaningful way,"
adding that, without the concept of drives, psychoanalytic understanding
"goes rather flat; it loses its depth, its connection to unconscious
strivings and fantasies and to vital bodily needs, its dynamics, and its
directedness (pp. 1024--1025). Mirroring her work, Mills (2002, 2005,
2006, 2012) integrates drive theory into relational psychoanalysis.
Reclaiming eros as foundational drive allows for much the psychoanalytic
opus to survive unscathed. Kline (2018) proposes, as I do, a
"nondualistic interpretation ... that both drives \[eros and thanatos\]
are manifestations of one central current of energy defined as libido"
(p. 68). Such a conclusion also comports with Erel's (2020) organizing
Winnicott's varying concepts on aggression into a singular phenomenon,
"love/strife" (p. 263n).

Concluding remarks

Illustrative of Lacan's (1991) university discourse, [[**controversies**
over]{.mark} the [death instinct]{.mark} will **[linger]{.mark}
forever**. They demonstrate the **problem** with]{.underline} postmodern
relativism, namely [the **ongoing struggle** for an **overarching
truth**]{.underline}. For example, [although [**biology** argues
against]{.mark} a [death drive]{.mark}, the **[ontological
assumption]{.mark}** of the unconscious [allows]{.mark} for
**[interdisciplinary contradiction]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Fortunately,
psychoanalytic scholars enjoy argument. Rich fodder remains --
particularly for a subject as complicated as aggression. However, [the
[death drive]{.mark} concept poses **five distinct
problems**]{.underline} for psychoanalysis. As just noted, [it
[conflicts]{.mark} with the [**basic precepts** of
biology]{.mark}]{.underline}. Freud's (1920, 1924, 1930) and Klein's
(1932, 1946, 1948, 1959) death drive solved a problem for a time -- like
aether did for physics. It explained destructive behaviors before
psychoanalysis matured to better explain them. Justifying the death
instinct with cell apoptosis, like Spielrein (1994) did and Hoffman
(2004) and Ameisen (1999) do, adds more fuel to the argumentative fire.
[On the **one** hand]{.underline}, apoptosis can be interpreted in
support of the death drive. [Biological processes involve **destructive
processes**]{.underline}. Hair cells die off and are replaced by new
ones. The cells lining the tongue have particularly short lives, and are
actively replaced. [On the other hand, and **violative** of the death
drive construct, the [replacement of]{.mark} hair and tongue
[cells]{.mark} can equally be interpreted as
**[life-enhancing]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Using the [death drive in clinical work]{.mark} proves
**[problematic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Many still use it,
but]{.underline} more for interclinician dialogue than direct patient
intervention. Mills (2006), Blass (2011), Kernberg (2009), Segal (1997),
Bergmann (2011), Meadow (2011), Sheftel (2011), and Reis (2011) report
they apply the death drive in their clinical work. [**None** of their
ideas, **however compelling**, included suggestions for making **actual
interpretations** to patients]{.underline}. Consider an adolescent girl
prone to self-laceration. [The death drive cannot be **entirely** ruled
out]{.underline} because of the previously discussed assumption of the
separate register -- the unconscious. [However, many **[alternative
ideas]{.mark}**]{.underline}, such as self-injuring to communicate
needs, to self-punish for perceived failings, or to compulsively repeat
historical abuse, [[explain]{.mark} the behavior in
**[clearer]{.mark}**, **more growth-promoting** ways. Even if the death
drive were **one component** of this hypothetical patient's motivation,
it would arguably be **harmful** to use it as an
explanation]{.underline}.

Additionally, [the phrase itself, [death drive]{.mark}, invites a
**[dangerous reductionism]{.mark}**. It rolls easily off the
tongue]{.underline}. The phrase "defund the police" elicits radically
different meanings than the phrase "allocate law enforcement resources
to community-based policing." In the same vein, [the phrase]{.underline}
"death instinct" is also [[**vague** and
**ambiguous**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [It **[fails to encompass]{.mark}**
many other, relevant contextual factors]{.underline}. Mitchell (1979),
for example, found ways of integrating psychoanalytic concepts such as
object relations and drive theories. Ideas [like **unconscious [internal
dramas]{.mark}**, **[social forces]{.mark}**, or **attachment models**
can be]{.underline} similarly [integrated]{.underline}. Developing, or
[**strictly adhering** to]{.underline}, one metapsychology or another,
or to [the death drive]{.underline}, [can be attributed to an
understandable need to **reduce**]{.underline} the
**[anxiety]{.underline}** we psychoanalysts feel when facing the
complexity of subjectivity. [The greater the **terror of infinity**, the
greater the temptation to adhere to **one belief system**]{.underline}.
Camus (1956) writes: There is not one human being who, above a certain
elementary level of consciousness, does not exhaust himself in trying to
form formulas or attitudes that will give his existence the unity it
lacks (1991, p. 262). Perhaps [the **[rigid adherence]{.mark}** to the
concept of the death drive [represents]{.mark} psychoanalysts
experiencing just such **[exhaustion]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We all
share a "nostalgia for the absolute" (Steiner, 2004, p. 5), which
postmodernism long ago left behind.

Further, and as also noted previously, systems and related models
improve cross-discipline communication, supporting the consilience
promoted by Wilson (1998) and preventing the incommensurability feared
by Kuhn (2012). He observed how [problems whose solution were vitally
important to an older tradition may **disappear**, become **obsolete**
or even **unscientific**, replaced by newer paradigms]{.underline}.
Ergo, [death drive]{.underline} (older) [transitions into **complex**,
**cross-theoretical**, **multicausal models**]{.underline}
(contemporary). Even if emerging from different foundational
assumptions, that is, evolutionary biology versus the dynamic
unconscious, [the lack of a common language **harms** the efforts of
psychoanalysis to **move forward** into a **more cohesive** and
**coherent discipline**. The **consilience** and **commensurability**
gained by adhering to]{.underline} eros-based, [**complex models**
serves the psychoanalytic project well]{.underline}.

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, [the promotion of such complex,
dynamic models enhances the likelihood of the **survival of
psychoanalysis**. The]{.underline} entire [psychoanalytic
project]{.underline}, despite its thriving more than a century, [faces
**extinction**]{.underline}. For lack of a better phrase, [the [death
drive **harms**]{.mark} **psychoanalysis' [public
relations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Space limitations preclude detailed
exploration, but [a **cross-theoretical** psychoanalytic
model]{.underline}, featuring eros as fundamental drive and highlighting
splitting, projection, and dissociation as primary defense mechanisms,
[explains aggression in a **more complete**, **accurate**, and
**consilient** manner]{.underline}. In final conclusion, I argue that
[aggression]{.underline} -- externally or internally directed --
[results from a **complex array of intrapsychic**, **interpersonal**,
and **environmental variables**, all **dynamically interacting** with
one another]{.underline}, and all grounded in preserving life.

### 2AC\-\--AT: Kristeva

#### Kristeva's framing of abjection is self-reifying.

Robbie **Duschinsky** 11-1-20**13**. Robbie Duschinsky is Professor of
Social Science and Health and Head of the Applied Social Science Group
within the Primary Care Unit. He is also Director of Studies in

Towards a Revised Account of Purity and Impurity,\" The Sociological
Review, Volume 61, Issue 4, https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-954X.12081. 苗

[Kristeva]{.underline} suggests that the [basic heterogeneous flux
of]{.underline} [existence]{.underline} is curtailed and [delineated to
form the]{.underline} '[symbolic' order of meaningful language and
personal subjectivity]{.underline}, and that 'the danger of filth
represents for the subject the risk to which the very symbolic order is
permanently exposed, to the extent that it is a device of
discriminations, of differences' (1982a: 69). This curtailment and
delineation of heterogeneity at the level of language repeats, [Kristeva
argues]{.underline}, the [subject\'s original struggle as an
infant]{.underline} to [develop]{.underline} an [autonomous identity
**vis-à-vis**]{.underline} our [mother]{.underline}:
'**[abjection]{.underline}** preserves what [existed in the
archaism]{.underline} of [pre-objectal relationship]{.underline}, in the
immemorial violence with which a body becomes separated from another
body in order to be' (1982a: 10). Kristeva thus [superimposes upon
Douglas\'s structural-functionalist argument]{.underline} the [proposal
that what runs against classificatory systems]{.underline} or the social
structure is impure because of its association with the early, infantile
period of human life before the distinction of subjects from objects,
self from mother: 'defilement is the translinguistic spoor of the most
archaic boundaries of the self\'s clean and proper body. In that sense,
if it is a jettisoned object, it is so from the mother (1982a: 74).

[Kristeva\'s description of abjection is evocative]{.underline}, and
vast in scope. It [promises profound insight on a range of]{.underline}
important [topics]{.underline}: the construction of identity; the
operation of language; the meaning of negative emotions; the psychology
of phobia; horror narratives as a literary genre, the repudiation and
oppression of outsiders, violence against women, inter alia. As a
result, [Kristeva\'s concept of 'abjection' has been widely]{.underline}
[used in the arts, humanities and social sciences]{.underline}. Yet
Menninghaus (2003) has suggested that since the [late]{.underline}
[1980s]{.underline} there has been [high demand for new social theory on
the topic of purity and impurity, and]{.underline} particularly in the
spheres of Anglophone politics, academia, art and cultural production.
These [themes]{.underline} have great [social importance, but have been
**inadequately and insufficiently theorized**]{.underline}. This is a
[point]{.underline} that has also **[been made by
Kristeva]{.underline}** (2004b: 155) herself: 'My [investigation into
abjection, violence and horror]{.underline} **[... picks up on a certain
vacuum']{.underline}** (see also Krauss 1999). It is not a
[question]{.underline} which other scholars or 'the media has bothered
to [develop ... and yet it is truly of capital importance']{.underline}
(2000: 20), and thus '[this venture]{.underline} into the (admittedly)
[dangerous terrain of abjection earned me much support']{.underline}
(2002: 161). [However]{.underline}, [Menninghaus]{.underline} has
[argued]{.underline}, this uptake of the **[concept of
abjection]{.underline}** has occurred in a way that has
'**[reified']{.underline}** the [theory]{.underline}, [in order to
circumvent Kristeva\'s claims]{.underline} that [purity]{.underline} and
impurity [classifications]{.underline} [are 'universally]{.underline}
and biologically [grounded]{.underline} (in the maternal body)' (2003:
390). This '[reified' account has been able to]{.underline} [engage with
themes of purity and impurity]{.underline} -- but does so, Menninghaus
suggests, **[without an adequate]{.underline}** **[theoretical
basis]{.underline}**. Though this certainly does not apply to all
researchers drawing on Kristeva, de Nooy (1998: 289) has concluded from
her review of academic uses of [Powers of Horror]{.underline} that in
practice 'the [abject' has tended to 'become a catch-all term for
"yucky" stuff']{.underline}. Campkin (2007: 79[) has concluded his
review of work on purity and impurity by asserting that 'the topic as a
whole has been **under theorized'.**]{.underline}

### 1AR\-\--AT: "Neuropsychoanalysis"

#### Neuropsychoanalysis is a [pseudoscientific misrepresentation]{.underline} of both neuroscience and psychoanalysis.

Confronting Dualism

[While the neuro-psychoanalysts would like to argue that they are simply
making Freud more scientific by integrating recent findings from brain
studies, the truth is that they are **repressing Freud's insights** in
order to present a reductive, biological model of the human
mind]{.underline}.Footnote24 Part of this strategy is to insist that
they are both maintaining and transcending the distinction between the
physical brain and the immaterial mind: "If we look at it with our
physical eyes, we see a brain, biological organ-like many others. If we
look at it with the eyes of our subjective consciousness, we come into
contact with mental states such as sadness, desire, and pleasure. It is
therefore necessary to keep both points of view (subjective and
objective) open and build dynamic parallelism between them" (3). The
way, then, to overcome the mind-body split is to argue that both sides
are distinct, yet they work in a parallel fashion.Footnote25 [One of the
problems with this theory is that Freud emphasizes how the mind can
imagine things that go beyond material reality, and human desire and
affects make a break with biological determinism]{.underline}. For
Freud, the mind can affect the body, and the body can affect the mind,
but they are not simply two sides of the same coin.Footnote26 [The
argument that the mind and body are distinct yet parallel is a
**rhetorical trick** driven by the desire to combine together two
**opposing theories**: psychoanalysis and neuroscience.]{.underline}

Although we can trace the activation of particular brain regions when
specific mental states occur, we cannot affirm that these mental states
are the pure product of physical structures.Footnote27 Since anything
can become a cause of desire, and people can imagine things that do not
exist in reality, their emotional states and internal mental
representations cannot be directly traced back to physical, biological
causes and structures. However, since Possati wants to produce a
scientific understanding of the human mind, he is motivated to posit
that only physical structures enable an objective, scientific
observation: "If we admit a single entity X 'behind' the terms 'mind'
and 'brain,' then we can say that (a) the mind is X perceived
subjectively---that is, through one's own consciousness---and (b) the
brain is X perceived objectively---that is, through external perception
and objectifying methods of sciences" (3). By arguing that the mind and
the body are separate but parallel, he is able to claim that he can
combine the objective, scientific analysis of the brain with a
subjective perception of the mind.Footnote28 Yet, he also wants to argue
that the mind is determined by emotions, and emotions are the result of
biological evolution, and so by focusing on emotion, he can eliminate
human subjectivity.

I would argue that [Possati is presenting a pseudo-science because he
relies on rhetorical tricks in order to make his supposedly rational,
objective observations]{.underline}.Footnote29 For example, in the
following argument, he presents an important criticism of his approach
only to dismiss it with a metaphorical sleight of hand:

neuropsychoanalysis does not intend to reduce the mind to the brain;
even if it has been accused of biologism, it does not intend to reduce
everything to biochemical processes and anatomy. All mental phenomena
require a biological correlate; this is indisputable. This does not
mean, however, entirely reducing the mental phenomena and their meaning
to supposed biological correlates. Biological and psychological
dimensions must be kept together; they must be considered two sources of
information of the same value. (3)

The [only way he can make this argument is by arguing at the same time
that mental states and biology are distinct, but they are also part of
the same thing]{.underline}. Once again, what is missing from this
theory is Freud's notion that the mind can separate itself from the
body, and the body does not fully determine desire and other affective
states.Footnote30 There is simply no way of moving from the physical to
the mental if one does not account for how the human mind is able to
imagine things that do not exist in reality, and we cannot affirm human
free will if we think that we are completely programmed by
evolution.Footnote31

In [replacing cognition with emotion in the definition of intelligence,
Possati is able to **repress human subjectivity** as he offers a
reductive understanding of human emotions]{.underline}.Footnote32 From
his perspective, his turn to biology and neuroscience helps him to
complete the task that Freud himself pursued:

The separation between psychoanalysis and neuroscience was for him only
a pragmatic, strategic, and temporary solution; it was motivated by the
lack of knowledge about the brain at the time. However, as Freud repeats
in several passages, the inevitable progress of neuroscience would
sooner or later lead to a bridging of the gap between the two
disciplines and to an organic basis for the discoveries of
psychoanalysis. (3)

While it is true that Freud at times argued that the future may bring a
biological explanation for all of his theories, his own discourse tells
a very different story.Footnote33 [By affirming human free will and
mental autonomy, Freud offered a way to see beyond biological
determinism]{.underline}. Interestingly, Possati keeps insisting that he
is not a biological determinist, but then he often returns to a
reductive evolutionary model.

### 1AR\-\--AT: Cards That Don't Actually Defend Science

#### Their evasiveness is proof that their theory is wrong. Only pseudoscientists [shrink from inquiry]{.underline} rather than engaging with it.

Maarten **Boudry** 10-27-20**21**, Dr. Maarten Boudry is a philosopher
of science and first holder of the Etienne Vermeersch Chair of Critical
Thinking at Ghent University. *Journal for General Philosophy of
Science*, Volume 53, p. 83-101"Diagnosing Pseudoscience -- by Getting
Rid of the Demarcation Problem"

5 Discussion and Conclusion

Philosophers of science have no agreed-upon account of "epistemic
warrant" in the sciences, and it is unlikely that we will ever reach
consensus on that matter. Though there are general accounts of epistemic
warrant such as Bayesianism, what it means for a theory to be
epistemically (un)warranted in one domain will differ substantially from
what that means in another domain, depending on the methodological
standards and explanatory norms pertaining to that field of inquiry. For
example, the protocol of randomized and double-blind clinical trials is
the gold standard for epistemic warrant in the medical sciences, but it
is not applicable to many other fields. And even in the medical
sciences, there are several others ways for a hypothesis to enjoy
epistemic warrant, in circumstances where the gold standard RCTs is
unattainable for practical or ethical reasons (e.g. circumstantial
evidence, cohort studies, mathematical models, and so forth).

If we have no general account of epistemic warrant in the sciences, then
a fortiori we can have no such account for the absence of epistemic
warrant. Even within a single field, it is difficult to list all the
possible ways in which a theory may fail to be epistemically warranted,
for the simple reason that in a complex world there will always be more
ways to do things wrong than to do them right. This, as Hansson pointed
out, means that the criterion of epistemic warrant is "not operational
on its own" for demarcation purposes (Hansson 2013, 71). [It is true
that all pseudosciences suffer from a **lack of epistemic warrant** in
one way or another, but until we have fleshed out what (lack of)
epistemic warrant amounts to in each domain, we will have made little
progress in separating the wheat from the chaff]{.underline}.

In cracking the demarcation problem, however, [the **symptomatic
approach** developed in this paper allows us to sidestep the question of
epistemic warrant]{.underline}. While there are myriad ways in which a
theory can fail to be epistemically warranted, [there are comparatively
fewer ways to create a false impression of epistemic warrant, and these
ways are largely similar across different fields of
inquiry]{.underline}. The epistemic flaws of a doctrine like creationism
are quite different from those of Holocaust denialism or astrology, but
the strategies engaged in by their advocates to explain away
counterevidence and solicit spurious confirmations will be largely
similar. In a recent paper, Dawes (2018) developed a "social process"
criterion for demarcation that is also symptomatic in the sense
developed here: it does not directly confront the epistemic defects of a
theory, but instead uses the rejection or exclusion of said theory by
the scientific community as an indirect, pro tanto reason to regard it
as pseudoscientific.

Laudan's principal objection to the demarcation project was that there
is no silver bullet or shortcut to separate good from bad theories.
Whether we like it or not, we have to put in the hard work of actually
evaluating the merits of each theory in a piecemeal fashion (Laudan
1982). The current proposal, however, while nothing like a silver
bullet, does allow us to save some time and effort in diagnosing each
new pseudoscience. [If we see proponents of a belief system
systematically engage in **evasive behavior and spurious moves**, we may
suspect that there is something rotten about that theory. Such a
symptomatic approach is useful for lay people and policy makers, but I
believe it also has some value for the scientific experts themselves: if
you are confronted with a theory that engages in these kinds of evasions
and equivocations, you have pro tanto reasons to **be very suspicious**
of that theory, even if you have not fully investigated all the relevant
evidence]{.underline}. Indeed, if the argument developed in this paper
is correct, the symptomatic demarcation criterion is general and can be
applied across the board: whatever the subject matter, pseudosciences in
all fields of inquiry will exhibit the immunizing tactics described
above, because all of them are confronted with the same problem: how to
survive and keep up appearances despite a lack of epistemic warrant?

Finally, though I believe my approach differs substantially from
Popper's falsificationism, it may also help to explain the enduring
popularity --- some would say tenacity --- of Popper's philosophy among
working scientists. Philosophers of science have poked numerous holes in
falsificationism, but scientists somehow have failed to take notice, and
Popper's stature in the scientific community remains largely
undiminished (Godfrey-Smith 2009). Indeed, many scientists do not
realize that their own scientific conduct contradicts the dictates of
strict falsificationism, which does not even allow for the notion that
theories can be confirmed or supported by evidence. Not only do Popper's
admirers seem to systematically distort his views of science, but more
importantly, they distort them in a more reasonable and sensible
direction. This is because, as I have argued, there is indeed an
important kernel of insight lurking in Popper's conception of science,
which was evidenced in his astute remarks on psychoanalysis and Marxism,
but which was unfortunately burdened with the double baggage of logicism
and deductivism. This kernel is: [good scientists stick out their necks
because they can afford to do so, while **pseudoscientists forever have
to "shrink from inquiry**", as Thomas Paine put it, because their
theories have nothing to do with reality. Science makes progress by
taking bold risks and learning from mistakes, while pseudoscience dig in
their heels and stick to their guns.]{.underline}

This paper does not pretend to have offered the final solution on the
question of pseudoscience, but I hope to have helped to revive interest
in a problem that has long been neglected by philosophers of science.
"[Pseudoscience" carves out a genuine phenomenon in our societies and,
because it causes significant damage, deserves closer philosophical
scrutiny]{.underline}. Philosophers of science can provide a valuable
service to the public interest by helping lay people and policy makers
to identify the false contenders of science. We should not resuscitate
the dream of a grand solution to what Lakatos called "the generalized
demarcation problem", but neither should we pretend that pseudoscience
does not exist.

### 2AC\-\--Psycho Bad

#### Psychoanalysis isn't universal and scaling it up to political conclusions is colonialist

**Rogers, 17**---Senior Lecturer in Criminology in the School of
Political Sciences at the University of Melbourne and Adjunct Professor
at Griffith Law School, Queensland (Juliet, "Is Psychoanalysis
Universal? Politics, Desire, and Law in Colonial Contexts," Political
Psychology, Vol. 38, No. 4, 2017, dml)

[[The **presumption of**]{.mark} **a [universal]{.mark} form of
[desire]{.mark}** [is an important starting point]{.mark} for the
analyst]{.underline} of any patient who arrives on the couch in the
psychoanalytic clinic. The psychoanalyst can only offer certain
parameters, with all their limitations. The patient, if the analyst
allows for an interrogation of their own forms of resistance, however,
can speak back to any frame of desire that the analyst presumes or
proposes. And the analyst---if Jacques Lacan's thoughts on resistance
are taken seriously (Lacan, 2007, p. 497; Rogers, 2016, pp.
183--187)---must listen, attend, learn, and adapt. But [when the desires
of subjects are **extended into the political realm**, when the wants
and needs of every subject are **presumed to articulate** with a
**psychoanalytic notion of universal desire**, then **something is
lost**]{.underline}. That something might be called the desire of the
other, or it might not be called desire at all.

The desire of the other is not easily seen in the wake of European
Enlightenment that has engulfed the imagination of psychoanalytic and
political theorists and practitioners alike. It is not easily seen, and
it is not easily conversed with when epistemological work presumes a
trajectory of desire and then applies it. In this application, [[there
is **little space** for a **radically other**]{.mark} **performance** of
[politics]{.mark} as action or imagination [to appear]{.mark}. [The
subject]{.mark} who is subsumed into this imagination]{.underline}---the
subject Gayatri Spivak (1996)1 describes as "the Other of
Europe"---[[has **little opportunity to do more** than "**utter**" under
the weight of its imagined subjectivity]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Spivak
(1999) says:

[\[I\]n the constitution of that Other of Europe, **great care** was
taken to **obliterate the textual ingredients** with which such a
subject could cathect, could occupy (invest?) its
itinerary]{.underline}---not only by ideological and scientific
production, but also by the institution of the law. (p. 266)

[Psychoanalysis is **as guilty** of exercising such a form of "**great
care**"]{.underline} as many of the occupations of French intellectuals
that Spivak has criticized for doing so.
[[Psychoanalysis]{.underline}]{.mark}, with its attention to the many
forms of the unconscious, can appear otherwise than guilty of this. It
can appear more open, generous, and curious about the many forms that
desire can take. In its later forms of attention to a politically
constituted "symbolic order" under the guidance of Lacan (2007), it can
also appear more attentive to the particularities of desires informed by
a politics of the time. I argue here, however, that attention [is
**already constituted** by an imagination of a subject who wants, who
needs, who desires objects, things, rights, in a mode which **[cannot
not start from]{.mark} a point of origin**, and [a **particular
political form of origin** which then **precludes the
recognition**]{.mark}]{.underline}---in both the clinic and in political
analysis2 ---[[of **other forms of desire**]{.underline}]{.mark}, "with
which such a subject could cathect, could occupy (invest?) its
itinerary." [When practices such as political psychoanalysis **presume a
particular form of desire**, [what is at stake]{.mark} in this
constitution of desire [is the **political subject**]{.mark} or [the
**Other**]{.mark} **of Europe** [who cannot
"speak,"]{.mark}]{.underline} in Spivak's terms. [[What is lost]{.mark}
might be called **radical desire**; it might be an **itinerary which is
cathected** or **invested otherwise**, and]{.underline}, as such, [it
[**might not be recognizable** in psychoanalysis]{.mark} or in
contemporary political psychology at all]{.underline}.

[The nonrecognition of the Other of Europe, in her many forms, is a
**consistent political problem**]{.underline}---documented often and
insistently by critical race and postcolonial analysts such as Spivak,
but also Sanjay Seth, Leila Gandhi, Chandra Talpade Mohanty, Aileen
Moreton-Robinson, Elizabeth Povinelli, Ashis Nandy, Christine Black, and
Homi Bhabha. [Such nonrecognition]{.underline}, however, [when
**repostulated in political psychoanalysis** has another effect. The
trajectory of the symptoms of political
practice]{.underline}---including desires for law, justice, particular
election outcomes, rights, socioeconomic configurations, or even for the
formation of political structures themselves (democracy being only
one)--- [presume a form of desire that **refers to**, and **endures
in**, its constitution]{.underline}. As Spivak (1999) notes in her
critique of power and desire as universal:

\[S\]o is "desire" misleading because of its paleonomic burden of an
originary phenomenal passion---from philosophical intentionality on the
one hand to psychoanalytic definitive lack on the other. (p. 107)

The psychoanalytic definitive lack she speaks of refers to the Lacanian
configuration of desire as always attempting to recover, to master, to
instantiate an identity that is supposedly interminably lost as soon as
language acts upon the subject. [This **[lack]{.mark}** is inaugurated
through the subjects relation to what it cannot have]{.underline}, or,
in Spivak's terms, the "originary phenomenal passion" referring to the
oedipal scene, [which [is **presumed**]{.mark} **to be [the origin of
desire for all]{.mark}**[. This]{.mark} configuration of desire
**renders all subjects** desiring of overcoming that lack. But it [is a
**particular form of desire** and]{.mark} a **particular quality of
[lack]{.mark}**[. The presumption of this
quality]{.mark}]{.underline}---the presumption about what and how people
desire---I argue here, [[**must be accountable** to]{.mark} the
[**politico-historical configurations** which]{.mark} have produced
it]{.underline}.

[Politico-historical configurations, [**by definition**, are **not
universal**]{.mark}]{.underline}. That is, contra Zizek (2006), I argue
that [[**not all the world is a symptom**, but]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[any psychoanalysis of a **political symptom**]{.mark}, of a
**political [subject]{.mark}**[, or]{.mark} of the [desires]{.mark}
examined through psychoanalysis as they **emerge [in a political
arena]{.mark}**[, assume a **particular formation**]{.mark} **of
desire**]{.underline}. And that such an analysis operates within the
parameters and employs the understandings of the oedipal scene, or,
simply of a subjectivity split by language, including the language of
law. As Lacan (2006) says "language begins along with law" (p. 225).
While [this split subjectivity **may appear to be
universal**]{.underline}---and is convincingly employed as such by
psychoanalytic and political theorists, and often philosophers (Butler,
1997; Epstein, 2013; Zevnik, 2016; Zizek, 2006), [this]{.underline}
splitting [**refers specifically** to]{.underline} an oedipal lineage,
[as a **particular instantiation** of]{.underline} Oedipal Law, and, as
I argue positive law as [a liberal law concerned with rights and with
what once can or cannot have from the polis]{.underline} as much as what
one can take from the father. Thus the "originary phenomenal passion,"
which a psychoanalysis of the political engages, always refers back as I
will explain, to a (primal) father as a sovereign in a wrangle with his
sons, a scene which itself cannot not be understood without its
resonances to the French Revolution.

### 2AC/1AR\-\--AT: Turns Case/We Desire Failure

#### Psychoanalytic theories of loss and lack can't scale up to the political, and all their args about us secretly desiring our own failure are wrong.

**Vázquez-Arroyo, 16**---Associate Professor, Political Science, Rutgers
University-Newark (Antonio, "POLITICAL ETHIC, VIOLENCE, AND DEFEAT,"
*Political Responsibility: Responding to Predicaments of Power*, Chapter
6, pg 210-216, dml)

[The]{.underline} turn of the century [predicament was described as one
of **loss**: the loss of the **idea of reason** as a privileged
standpoint]{.underline}; the loss of an alternative system to
capitalism, namely, the loss of the socialist dream; [the loss of
**humanity** in wars and genocides and from atomic weapons]{.underline};
for American liberals, the loss of innocence from the sixties on;
[and]{.underline}, more recently, [the loss of]{.underline} human life,
along with [a **sense of security** and **invulnerability**]{.underline}
in the aftermath of 9/11 and the wars it triggered.5 Of course, many of
these are not really losses. Psychically, as Sigmund Freud notoriously
argued, one can actually lose what one never had and thus mourn
something that has never existed. But losses, real or imagined,
frequently lead to a condition of grief, especially the loss of human
life at the hands of catastrophes such as terrorism (statist and
nonstatist) and genocide. Or, as the editors of Loss put it, given how
the past century "resounds with catastrophic losses of bodies, spaces,
and ideals, psychic and material practices of loss and its remains are
productive for history and for politics."6 Yet, [while this
invocation]{.underline} of politics and history [is
promising]{.underline}, in the volume in question [these are **labile**,
**mostly perfunctory gestures** toward the historical and the
political]{.underline}. Indeed, what is striking in most reflections on
loss is that [the recognition of loss **has not led to a careful
reckoning with its historicity**; neither has it led to a **nuanced
understanding of the political configurations** in which losses became
such, nor to a theorization of the **possibility** and **desirability of
substantive political action** in their aftermath]{.underline}.
Oftentimes, [the language of loss has been **transplanted** from the
psychoanalytic connotations, **better suited for individuals**, to the
**collective**, with **little sustained reflection** on the ways the
challenges and demands of the collective are **occluded** by the
**solipsistic connotations** built into individual categories.
Politically, asymmetrical relations of race, class, gender, and status
**mediate the ways** an individual experiences loss, and these are
**historically entrenched in political**, **cultural**, and **economic
contexts**. But **none of these mediations can be discerned** on the
basis of **psychoanalytic accounts** of loss and mourning, however much
else these accounts may contribute and enlighten. **Critically examining
the historical** and **structural variables** that hinder one's capacity
to act politically in the face of loss is **primarily a
critical-epistemological task** with **different obligations** than
those defining individual losses.]{.underline}

Overall, political losses are the outcome of struggles for power, which
sometimes lead to predicaments of suffering and deprivation. In some
cases these are the product of struggles about the identity of a
collectivity---whether it is bound by a democracy, oligarchy, or
military dictatorship---or of technological and economic developments
that have led to the loss of democratic values and aspirations.7
Accordingly, rather than [speaking of loss]{.underline}, which [in its
psychoanalytical connotations tends to **turn the political subject
inward**]{.underline}, in a political context one may prefer to speak of
defeat or at least cast loss from this perspective. Although not every
loss is the outcome of defeat, political losses are oftentimes entangled
with the defeat of a specific project or vision. In terms of political
losses defining the nineties, one can count political visions of genuine
democracy and socialism. **[In contrast to psychoanalytic
loss]{.underline}**, loss as [defeat]{.underline} suggests a projection
outward that [demands a **reconsideration** of the historical and
political trajectories, as well as the travails, of one's commitments in
the spirit of soberly confronting one's fate for the sake of a
realignment of forces]{.underline}, of a redrawing of the lines of
enmity, so to speak, [in the hope of **securing a future for one's
animating ideals**]{.underline}. Defeats thus unfold as part of
political history outside of which the complexities and political
valences of loss and losing cannot be made sense of. All [this demands a
**projection outward** and **critical reckoning** with historical
predicaments of power. It also suggests a reassessment that is
**anchored** in a **reflective** yet **persistent commitment to action**
in a predicament of power where one may have already lost]{.underline},
a situation in which responsive action avoids reifying enmity without
erasing its demarcating lines or removing their role in the constitution
of one's political identity and ensuing political forms. Political life
unavoidably entails drawing enmity lines, even if these vary and
fluctuate. And these fluctuations are largely conditioned by the
collectivity's political form and the political identity it enables and
fixes.8

Yet the oscillations in [the intensification of political enmity mostly
stem from the structuring of the political field as a space of
contestation]{.underline} in which intensification is not just a
function of radicalism, but [of the **relative power** and **balance of
forces** of the collective agencies in play.]{.underline}
[Conflicts]{.underline} and forms of enmity [must be assessed **not by
recourse to moralizing categories**, or other **extra-political
supplements**, but by reference to the **internal criteria of the
political**, as an **autonomous field of action** and **judgment** with
its own codes and references, principles and rules]{.underline}. One of
Wolin's most sobering formulations captures yet another dimension of the
question of enmity and its relevance in reckoning with loss as defeat:
"power struggles produce losses, and, as a consequence, things of value
go out of the world." One needs to add to this that defeat is therefore
central to power struggles, as is victory.9 Sometimes even democratic
orders are serendipitously won in defeat, as the late León Rozitchener
once observed apropos of Argentina's transition to democracy in 1983, an
origin that leaves sediments in the new order that emerges out of it and
that explains the pacified and rather labile form of democracy won in
defeat.10 Still, [the **terms of engagement** in power
struggles]{.underline}, victories, and defeats [and the **forms** and
**contents of political orders change over time**, **sometimes
suddenly**, even when many a continuity and sediment of past struggles
remain. And this **leaves openings** for yet unforeseen
possibilities]{.underline}.

There is, to be sure, a venerable tradition of sharp political and
politically minded theorizing from the perspective of defeat. From
Thucydides to Machiavelli, from Tocqueville and Marx to Weber and
Schmitt, Gramsci and Weil, Benjamin and Adorno, the experience of loss
as defeat has imposed a different burden on theoretical reflection, a
projection outward, to and for the world, leading to a set of sobering
questions that better apprehend the fate of their animating ideas by
means of historically grounded reflections.11 Better yet, acknowledging
defeat need not lead to bowing in front of the victorious. In Ana María
Amar Sánchez's almost untranslatable formulation, "los derrotados no se
dan por vencidos."12 Namely, the defeated hardly surrender in the face
of defeat; rather than bowing to the victorious, the defeated have
decided to persist and prevail, intractably clinging to their sense of
fidelity to political convictions and political-ethical principles. From
this perspective, loss is thus closely connected with failure and defeat
(even if both these connotations have yet to be established in U.S.
political discourse, mediated as it is by the American conceit of
winners and losers). Losses, in this sense, could sometimes be the
outcome of unwitting acts, but that need not always be the case. For
defeat, the possibility of loss and failure is precisely what is risked
in political actions and interventions: defeat is, then, always a
possibility and often the outcome of conscious---but no less
tragic---decisions to stake out a political claim at a critical
juncture, which could lead to a tragic and/ or dramatic finale.13
Responding to loss and defeat can lead to either acquiescence to what is
or an unyielding resistance to an accommodating consensus, the two poles
around which most responses to loss are situated. At these two poles one
finds questions of utopia, political sobriety and literacy, and
political responsibility all entangled with defeat and memory, as well
as with the memory of defeat.

[It is at this juncture that the stakes in **avoiding the conflation of
individual processes**]{.underline} of mourning losses [with **political
losses**]{.underline} and defeat [become **clearer** and **more sharply
delineated**]{.underline}. Remembrance, [the memory of injustice and the
political, **demands something quite different** from, if not the
**absolute opposite** of, moving on in the **psychological sense** of
the expression]{.underline}. For instance, **[individuals]{.underline}**
living through dictatorship and misery [have to cope with the
predicaments of losses]{.underline} (psychic and real) that these
experiences inaugurate, and it would be foolish, not to say moralistic,
to disavow individual needs in dealing with loss and the forgetting that
sheer survival often entails. [And yet this **hardly needs to be
extrapolated at the collective level**, even if a political actor is
sometimes afflicted by both loss and defeat]{.underline}. Herein resides
the crucial difference between loss and defeat, which current
invocations of loss tend to dedifferentiate: one mourns the loss of
loved ones, but the correlate of defeat is the disappointment of a
setback, failure, and dissatisfaction, not mournful loss. Overcoming
political setbacks, however, precisely demands mourning the personal
losses involved, which is a necessary if insufficient condition to
preempt a moralist response to defeat or a politically truncated
mournful stance.

[Politically speaking, defeat involves neither **perpetual melancholia**
nor **mourning**]{.underline} understood as moving on, [but the
acknowledgment that in its aftermath one needs to **resist it** and its
corollaries as the **sole alternatives**, which for all political
purposes lead to **acquiescence to an unjust present** in
which]{.underline} mourning, **[resignation]{.underline}**, and
forgetting [are presented as the **only feasible alternatives**, thus
cast as the **politically** and **ethically responsible thing to do**.
Rather than acquiescence, an alternative way of reckoning with these
predicaments is to understand defeat **not as the ultimate failure** of
one's project, but as the **situational outcome** of a **particular
struggle**. These outcomes demand **reflection**, **resistance**, and a
sense of]{.underline} hopeful stillness---the last is best conceived as
**[sober anticipation]{.underline}**---[for a **future reckoning** with
the victor, the **imperatives** and **forms** of what the victor has
sought to inaugurate and/or perpetuate, and **what their overcoming
demands**]{.underline}.14 Or, to cast it in terms closer to Gramsci, a
staunch theorist of a political ethic: as a political actor, one can
experience defeat after an attempt at a "war of maneuver," but that
experience need not lead to estrangement from the political field;
instead, what it calls for is continuous wars of position that soberly
confront these predicaments and set the stage for future wars of
maneuver. 15 Or, in the less militant but no less compelling formulation
offered by María Zambrano, [a sober reckoning with defeat entails
**grasping the larger continuum of history**, rather than **hanging on
to the immediacy of the moment of defeat**, no matter how much it hurts,
**envisaging** and **anticipating a future** in which the present moment
will be **redressed**]{.underline}.16 That a prisoner of Mussolini and
an exile from Franco conjured these thoughts in their darkest hour is in
and of itself exemplary of political literacy and fidelity, a political
literacy that, from the perspective of a political ethic, represents
fidelity to ethical and political values, to oneself and to one's
collectivity or the principles binding one's political vision. Their
dignity accentuates the lack of political imagination and nerve so
characteristic of those at the receiving end of less arduous defeats in
far less dangerous political predicaments, say, those defining the
depoliticized politics characteristic of the North Atlantic world.

[There are]{.underline}, of course, **[temptations]{.underline}**
associated with the perspective of the defeated. One is [to **find
silver linings in the present**, to find **redeeming qualities** and
thus **facilitate compliance** to it]{.underline}; another, closely
related, is [to **retreat to an ethics of conviction** in which, rather
than being a **provisional**, if **crucial**, stage in the political
field, resistance becomes its **permanent feature**. The latter's
tendency to **slip into moralism**]{.underline} or into what the French
call gauchisme [is plain enough. Or]{.underline}, better still, [to
retreat to an ethics of conviction that **abandons the political field**
and **tacitly abdicates any sense of fidelity to political forms** that
embody one's values and aspirations and thus **renders a setback into a
permanent defeat**]{.underline}. Indeed, [there is the temptation of
**self-satisfied consolation** and the **misrecognition of the scenes of
power** either by a **backward gaze** that leads to **melancholy** and
**resentment** or by **unreflective** and **disoriented
hopefulness**]{.underline}. Think of the fate of left liberalism in the
United States, for instance. Adolph Reed Jr. has offered a trenchant but
accurate characterization of [this left]{.underline} as one that
"[**careens** from this oppressed group on crisis moment to that one,
from **one magically** or **morally pristine constituency** or **source
of political agency**]{.underline} . . . [to another]{.underline};" a
left [that not only "**lacks focus** and **stability**" but also betrays
a "**dilettantish politics**]{.underline} \[that\] is partly the
heritage of a generation of defeat and marginalization, of decades
[**without any possibility of challenging power** and **influencing
policy**]{.underline}."17

[How to **effectively curb these temptations** and the **erratic
political strategies** these lead to? An **avowal of political
literacy** and **sober realism** might serve as an entry point to a
**future realignment of the political field** and to structuring it in
ways **more congenial to one's political values** and **aspirations for
collective life**. Doing so entails]{.underline}, among other things,
[**surrendering the temptations of moralism** and confronting defeat
soberly and squarely, while **learning from intelligent versions of the
positions of one's opponents**. This **need not mean a suspension of
political-ethical judgment** on their actions and principles, but rather
an attempt to **dissect the structural field** and grasp **what led to
their victory** and **our defeat**]{.underline}. At least two
[**positive outcomes** can emerge]{.underline} from such a reckoning:
[first,]{.underline} [**learning whatever can be learned** about the
**strategies** and **tactics** of the victorious party and **emulating
what is consistent** with one's own political-ethical principles and
values]{.underline}; [second]{.underline}, which is a corrective to the
first, [**becoming alert** to the extent to which one's actions and
practices **may sustain rather than challenge current predicaments of
power** and]{.underline}, even worse, [**reproduce practices** and
**principles that one abhors** in one's political enemy]{.underline}.18

This dispute will gain prominence in the next chapter. But first I want
to illustrate that though the reading of death-dealing negativity that
Edelman extracts from Lacan is available in Lacan's work, so is a very
different reading of negativity. More specifically, though it is true
that Lacan connects the death drive to the suicidal act, presenting
Antigone as a heroine who is unwilling to cede on her desire even when
she knows that this desire will lead to her demise, he also explicitly
links the death drive to a "will to make a fresh start," "a will to
create from zero, a will to begin again" (1959--1960, 212). He in fact
suggests that insofar as the death drive "challenges every- thing that
exists" (212), it can make visible what is invisible from the point of
view of the social order, thereby inviting a fundamental reconfiguration
(rather than simply a destruction) of that order. The same logic can
arguably be applied to the subject, so that the death drive's "will to
make a fresh start" might productively be taken to gesture toward the
kind of psychic rebirth that clinical practice, in Kristeva's opinion,
can bring about (see chapter 2). In other words, although Lacan
certainly does not imply that acts of subjective destitution invariably
result in collective or personal revitalization, the possibility of such
revitalization---a possibility that Edelman studiously ignores---is
nevertheless present in his account. This possibility of revitalization
is what Badiou has explored through his notion of the truth event as a
sudden revelation that erases the individual's status quo---her
"business as usual"---and brings into being the so-called subject of
truth, a subject who, through its fidelity to the unanticipated insight
offered by the event, engenders a new (collective or personal) order of
things. Žižek, whose reading of Lacan is closer to that of Edelman,
routinely takes issue with Badiou's interpretation, accusing Badiou of
not fully grasping the destructive power of the death drive. Yet Žižek
himself at times also views subjective destitution as a spur for a new
order of things, as when, for instance, he observes that "the act
differs from an active intervention (action) in that it radically
transforms its bearer (agent). . . . in it, the subject is annihilated
and subsequently reborn (or not)" (2001, 44). Unlike Edelman, Žižek here
seems to recognize that even though the act may not consciously aim at
rebirth, and even though it may not inevitably lead to such rebirth, it
can under certain circumstances have this effect. I suspect that the
ambivalence regarding the matter arises precisely from the fact that
both readings are available in Lacan, so that where one ends up---at
destruction or rebirth---depends on what one chooses to highlight. Even
[[Lacan's statement about the death drive]{.mark} functioning [as "a
will to begin again" is wrought with ambiguity]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[One can argue]{.underline}---[as]{.underline} Philip
[Sayers]{.underline} (2014) skillfully [does]{.underline}---that
[the]{.underline} ["will to begin again,"]{.underline} the "will to make
a fresh start," [refers to the will to return to the beginning of the
repetition compulsion]{.underline}, to start "afresh" the process of
pursuing the thread of this compulsion, the thread of one's fundamental
psychic destiny. [Read in this way, the will to begin again]{.underline}
[suggests]{.underline} that [the subject defends against
rebirth]{.underline}---understood as a reconfiguration of life---[by
opting for the familiar trajectory of the repetition
compulsion]{.underline}. [[Sayers's reading is]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[compatible with McGowan's analysis]{.mark} of the drive]{.underline}
as what enjoys by enjoying "nothing," by never attaining its goal.
Translated into my vocabulary, [it [implies]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}that [the [death drive causes the subject to]{.mark} repeatedly
[recommence]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}its circling [[around
the]{.underline}]{.mark} traumatic [[kernel of the lost
Thing]{.underline}]{.mark}. Yet [even [within this
interpretation]{.mark}, [there is room for a]{.mark} degree of
"[rebirth]{.mark}" in the sense that [each]{.mark} new [cycle]{.mark} of
the repetition compulsion repeats slightly
differently]{.underline}---draws new elements, new debris of life, into
the groove of the compulsion---[so]{.underline} [that]{.underline} even
when the repetition is largely predictable[, it [is always]{.mark} also
somewhat [unpredictable]{.mark}]{.underline}; to the extent that
something new is added to the repetition compulsion with every new
enactment, [[one can]{.underline}]{.mark} still [[speak of a "fresh
start]{.underline}]{.mark}" of sorts. [This]{.underline} interpretation
[agrees]{.underline} with the conclusion regarding the repetition
compulsion that I arrived at in the last chapter, namely,
[that]{.underline} [[the compulsion]{.underline}
[is]{.underline}]{.mark} usually [[impossible to
break]{.underline}]{.mark} in any definitive sense, [that [the best the
subject can do is]{.mark} to [develop a more
active]{.mark}]{.underline}---and ideally more satisfying---
[[relationship]{.underline}]{.mark} to it. [This is one]{.underline}
[reason]{.underline} that [[one cannot]{.underline},]{.mark} in the
Lacanian con- text, [[speak about an]{.underline}]{.mark} analytic
"cure," about an [ultimate [solution]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}(what
Lacan mockingly calls "the Sovereign Good") that would, once and for
all, release the subject from its suffering; [the best]{.underline}
clinical [practice can accomplish is]{.underline} [to facilitate the
subject's capacity to enter into the cycle of the repetition compulsion
in less injurious ways.]{.underline} This may, for instance, entail
developing a greater degree of critical distance from the compulsion so
that moments of intervention---moments when the subject decides against
its "usual" manner of going about the process of living---become
possible. Starting "afresh" in this sense is merely a matter of starting
from a slightly different perspective. Although I find this
interpretation persuasive, [I am]{.underline} also [inclined to read
Lacan's statement about the "will to create from zero, a will to begin
again" alongside his famous musings about a potter who creates a vase
around a void, "creates it, just like the mythical creator, ex nihilo,
starting with a hole]{.underline}" (1959--1960, 120). [In both cases,
Lacan suggests that absence]{.underline} (zero, a hole) [is a source of
creativity. [The zero of the death drive]{.mark} and the hole of the
vase [are far from being inert spaces of lack]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Rather, [[they give rise to the desire to play]{.mark} with
lack]{.underline}; [they]{.underline}---to return to my wording in
chapter 1--- [generate the impulse to work with negativity]{.underline}.
Essentially, Lacan stresses that emptiness and creativity---[the zero of
the death drive and the will to begin again;]{.underline} the void of
the vase and the fashioning of the vase that comes to enclose
it---[arise simultaneously]{.underline}. This is Lacan's figurative
means of conveying one of his most fundamental insights about human
subjectivity, namely, that [our sense of lack and our capacity to
signify come into being in tandem: the signifier causes our lack but our
lack]{.underline}, in turn, [causes the urge to signify]{.underline}. Or
to state the matter con- versely, [it is because we lack that we are
prompted to signify]{.underline} (create) yet it is our significatory
(creative) activity that allows us to (sort of) handle our lack. This is
arguably what we do when we write books (yes?). In this sense, [there is
a [direct connection between]{.mark} our [alienation]{.mark} on the one
hand [and]{.mark} our [capacity to envision imaginative ways of
coping]{.mark} with this alien- ation on the other]{.underline}. In
addition, [because our alienation can never be definitively
redeemed]{.underline}, because we have no way of turning our negativity
into a definitive form of positivity, [our significatory endeavors are
transient at best, giving us access to no permanent meaning, no solid
identity, no unitary narrative of self- actualization.]{.underline} Any
fleeting state of positivity that we may be able to attain must always
in the end dissolve back into negativity; any attempt to erase lack
produces new instances of lack. [This means that the process of working
with negativity must be continually renewed, which is why we start
writing a new book the minute the old one is finished]{.underline}. Or
at least I do. [The hope is that if I work through the same ideas one
more time, maybe I will finally be able to put them to rest. But they do
not rest.]{.underline} Some of them insist on remaining wide awake,
asking for yet another articulation: thus the endless recycling of
thoughts, the endless "will to begin again." [In the same way that no
object of desire can ever fully gratify, our every attempt to fill our
lack unavoidably falls short of its goal: there will]{.underline}, quite
simply, [never be a perfect book]{.underline}, the book of books that
extinguishes the desire for a better book. [However]{.underline}, as I
have observed, [[the lack of complete satisfaction does not mean]{.mark}
that there is [no satisfaction]{.mark} to be had.]{.underline} If any-
thing, [[the]{.mark} intrinsic [impossibility of]{.mark} complete
[satisfaction is what sustains us]{.mark} as creatures of becoming and
[what allows us]{.mark}, over and again, [to]{.mark} take up the
inexhaustible process of [producing meaning]{.mark}, including the
process of signifying beauty]{.underline}. As Kaja Silverman states,
"[Our [capacity to signify beauty has no limits]{.mark}. It is born of a
loss which can never be adequately named, and whose consequence is,
quite simply, the human imperative to engage in a ceaseless
signification. It is finally this never-ending symbolization that the
world wants from us"]{.underline} (2000, 146).

#### The death drive doesn't exist, but their continued use of it to mimetically explain all violence means they link more

[[The death-drive]{.mark} theory has not found wide
acceptance]{.underline} among Freud\'s followers. With significant
exceptions like Melanie Klein, [it [has been explicitly denounced as
**misconceived biology, unsubstantiated speculation, logically
incoherent and**]{.mark}/or **[without evidence]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[It has also been attributed to Freud\'s own painful personal
circumstances: the death of his daughter, the death of a grandson, his
own illness (cancer), and his lifelong preoccupation with
death]{.underline}. [Of [those]{.mark} who have been [sympathetic to the
idea]{.mark}, most have tended to tame it]{.underline} - as indeed did
Freud himself. [One move was to [rewrite the instinct as]{.mark} largely
an instinct of [aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}. But for Freud the
aggressive aspect of the death drive had been secondary; the instinct
was primarily self-destructive. Sadism derives from a more primordial
masochism, which means in effect that human aggression is, originally,
self destructiveness. Of all subsequent theorists of psychoanalysis,
Jacques Lacan takes the death drive most seriously, and most
contemporary psychoanalytic attention to it comes via him. To his
credit, Lacan does not underplay or tame the death drive, and he locates
Freud firmly within the Western tradition when he remarks that Freud
questioned life as to its meaning and his answer was not that it had
none \'which is a convenient way of washing one\'s hands of the whole
business\' - but that life has \'only one meaning, that in which desire
is borne by death\' (Ecrits, p. 277). According to Lacan, the Freudian
world is one not of things, nor even of being, but rather of desire.
More so even than Freud, Lacan finds in desire \'the paradoxical,
deviant, erratic, eccentric, even scandalous character by which it is
distinguished from need\'. Although this distinction has been \'always
obvious to moralists worthy of the name\', psychoanalysis nevertheless
misses the point by pursuing an obscurantist reduction of desire to need
(p. 286). And that, for Lacan, is a cardinal error. This distinction
belween desire and need leads him to dwell on something else in both
Freud and earlier writers, moralists and otherwise: the relation between
desire and lack. In modern psychoanalysis we find a secularized,
intensified version of an existential perception that goes back a long
way, even though the immediate influences here are Heidegger and Kojeve:
Desire is a relation of being to lack. This lack is the lack of being
properly speaking. It isn\'t the lack of this or that, but lack of being
whereby the being exists. (Lacan, Seminar, 11.222-3) For Lacan, death is
the name for a primordial absence intrinsic to presence; as John
Forrester puts it, \'presence includes as its very condition the limit
beyond which is its absence\' (p. 176).16 To bind desire so resolutely
into lack and absence means that it inevitably becomes a kind of
essential negativity (Lacan, Seminar, 1.146)\*\' - something premised on
an initial failure of satisfaction and which, as such, comes to exist
only by virtue of its own alienation; as Juliet Mitchell puts it,
\'Desire persists as an effect of a primordial absence and it therefore
indicates that, in this area, there is something fundamentally
impossible about satisfaction itself (Lacan. Feminine Sexuality, p. 6).
One consequence of this is a radical fragmentation of the human
subject.18 In one respect Lacan recasts the familiar metaphysical idea
that life is rooted in death: \'it is death that sustains existence\'
(Ecrits, p. 300). In his development of this idea he combines diverse
elements of the Western tradition of desire\'s impossibility: a theology
of desire as death, crossed with something more romantic if no less
severe - desire as annihilating excess, a primordial discord. The two
elements are fused in those places where, for example, he speaks of
\'that desperate affirmation of life that is the purest form in which we
recognize the death instinct\' (p. 104). These ideas then get reworked
according to structuralist and linguistic preoccupations, as when he
speaks of the \'frenzy\' of desire \'mocking Ihe abyss of Ihe
infinite\', and of how this amounts to \'no other derangement of
instinct than that of being caught in the rails - eternally stretching
forth towards the desire for something else - of metonymy. Hence its
\"perverse\" fixation at the very suspension-point of the signifying
chain where the memory-screen is immobilized and the fascinating image
of the fetish is petrified\' (p. 167). In the same vein Lacan suggests
that it is from death that existence takes on all the meaning it has;
the lack which is at the heart of desire is also the price that human
beings pay for their admission to language and culture. Death makes life
possible in that it makes meaning and representation possible; it is not
only before speech but \'primordial to the birth of symbols\' (pp.
104-5, 300). Hence Lacan\'s most well-known formulation, that the
unconscious is structured like a language, and his claim to have
demonstrated \'the profound relationship uniting the notion of the death
instinct to the problems of speech\' (Four Fundamental Concepts, p. 20;
Merits, p. 101). Richard Boothby regards this as the most radical and
innovative aspect of Lacan. I remain unconvinced.19 Lacan\'s invocations
of death\'s centrality to life are more derivative than their complex,
often obscure, formulations suggest.20 When he declares that All that
life is concerned with is seeking repose as much as possible while
awaiting death. This is what devours the time of the suckling baby at
the beginning of its existence\... Life is concerned solely with dying
{Seminar. 11.233) we can hear Freud and Schopenhauer most closely, but
also Montaigne (especially in that last assertion - \'Life is concerned
solely with dying\'), who also, incidentally, consolidated his own
perception of this truth with extensive citation of classical sources.
In the giving over of the newborn child to death we might hear too the
early Christian Fathers. Lacan does not exactly disguise his precedents;
the passage just cited continues with a reference to Hamlet\'s \'to die,
to sleep, perchance to dream\' and to the idea developed by philosophers
in antiquity that it would have been better not to have been born. But
(and this recalls Freud\'s own evasive acknowledgment of his influences)
in Lacan these [allusions to the past are fleeting, in passing, almost
secretive; the implication is that these past [writers anticipate
something which can only]{.mark} properly, and only now, [be understood
through the lens of]{.mark}]{.underline} Lacanian
[[psychoanalysis]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[whose complexity is]{.mark}, at
the same time, almost [guaranteed to defeat the attempt]{.mark}. Some at
least of [that]{.mark} complexity [is
**obscurantist**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the wake of contemporary
cultural developments, including the perceived failure of sexual
radicalism and the trauma of AIDS, there are those who have turned to
Lacan for a more honest view of desire, and, via him, are reconsidering
a severe account of human desire. I should not speak for them; [[what I
find]{.underline}]{.mark} in Lacan [[is an **overtheorized**
expression]{.underline}]{.mark} of something more significantly and
relevantly expressed elsewhere (in Freud and before). It this respect I
believe he is [symptomatic of a much wider tendency in (post-) modern
theory]{.underline}. But in terms of his influence alone Lacan remains
significant for this study. By crossing Freud\'s death drive with the
philosophy of lack and nothingness derived from Kojeve\'s version of
Hegel (itself influenced by Heidegger), he continues to drive death ever
further into being; now, perhaps more inexorably than ever before, death
is the lack which drives desire. In doing that he also exemplifies
another significant tendency in modern thought which I have already
remarked, namely [the antihumanist wish [to decentre]{.mark} \'man\' in
the name of a philosophy which is truly adequate to the complexity of
[being]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[yet]{.underline}]{.mark} [[which seeks to
**retain**]{.mark} a residual human **[mastery]{.mark}** in the very
effort of articulating this complexity]{.underline}. As we have seen,
the philosophical bid to comprehend the truth of being was always a form
of intellectual empowerment - even, or rather especially, when issuing
in the declaration that life, desire and the world have to be renounced.
But [modern theory, having lost faith in older philosophical notions of
truth, now half-settles for the mastery of a new kind of complexity
which it partly produces in order to enable this performance of mastery.
**[Phoenix-like]{.mark}**, the omniscient, masterful and above all
complex analytic of [the]{.mark} modern [theorist **rises above** his
sacrifice of \'man\' to death]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Just imagining possible changes is necessary and can motivate action.

Elizabeth **SHOVE** Sociology @ Lancaster **AND** Gordon **WALKER**
Geography @ Lancaster **'7** "CAUTION! Transitions ahead: politics,
practice, and sustainable transition management" *Environment and
Planning C* 39 (4)

For academic readers, our commentary argues for loosening the
intellectual grip of 'innovation studies', for backing off from the
nested, hierarchical multi-level model as the only model in town, and
for exploring other social scientific, but also systemic theories of
change. [The more we think about the politics and practicalities
of]{.underline} reflexive [transition management]{.underline}, the more
complex the process appears: for a policy audience, our words of caution
could be read as an invitation to abandon the whole endeavour. If
agency, predictability and legitimacy are as limited as we've suggested,
this might be the only sensible conclusion.However, [we are with
Rip]{.underline} (2006) [i[n recognising the
value]{.underline}]{.mark}[, productivity and everyday necessity [of an
**'illusion of agency'**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and of the working
expectation that [a difference can be made even in the face of]{.mark}
so much [evidence to the contrary]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The outcomes of
[actions are unknowable]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[the system
unsteerable]{.mark} and the effects of deliberate intervention
inherently unpredictable and, ironically, it is [this]{.mark} that
[sustains concepts of agency]{.mark} and management.]{.underline} As Rip
argues '[**[illusions are productive]{.mark}** be[cause they **motivate
action** and repair work, and thus something]{.mark}]{.underline}
(whatever[[) is achieved']{.underline}]{.mark} (Rip 2006: 94). [Situated
inside the systems they seek to influence, governance
actors]{.underline} -- and actors of other kinds as well - [are part of
the **dynamics of change**: even if they cannot steer from the outside
they are **necessary to processes within**. This is,]{.underline} of
course, also [true of academic life]{.underline}. Here [we
are,]{.underline} busy critiquing and [analysing transition management
in the expectation that somebody somewhere is listening and]{.underline}
maybe [even taking notice. If we removed that illusion would we bother
writing anything at all? Maybe we need such fictions to keep us going,
and maybe -- fiction or no - somewhere along the line something really
does happen,]{.underline} but not in ways that we can anticipate or
know.

the spirit of Emile Durkheim than of Sigmund Freud, I show how

#### Psychoanalysis is non-falsifiable.

**Gordon 1**, psychotherapist living and working in London, 2K1 ¶ (Paul,
Psychoanalysis and Racism: The politics of defeat Race & Class v. 42, n.
4)

[The problem with]{.underline} [the application
of]{.underline} [psychoanalysis]{.underline} [to social
institutions]{.underline} [is that]{.underline} **[there can be no
testing of the claims made]{.underline}**. [If someone
says]{.underline}, for instance, that [nationalism is a form of looking
for and seeking to replace the body of the mother one has
lost]{.underline}, or that the popular appeal of a particular kind of
story echoes the pattern of our earliest relationship to the maternal
breast, [how can this be proved]{.underline}? [The pioneers of
psychoanalysis]{.underline}, from Freud onwards, all [derived their
ideas]{.underline} [in the context of]{.underline} their [work with
individual patients]{.underline} and their ideas can be examined in the
everyday laboratory of the therapeutic encounter where the validity of
an interpretation, for example, is a matter for dialogue between
therapist and patient. [Outside of the consulting room, there can
be]{.underline} **[no]{.underline}** **[such]{.underline}** **[verification
process,]{.underline}** [and the further one moves from the individual
patient, the less purchase psycho- analytic ideas can
have.]{.underline} [Outside the therapeutic encounter**, anything and
everything can be true**, psychoanalytically speaking]{.underline}. [But
if every- thing is true, then]{.underline} **[nothing can be
false]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[therefore nothing can be
true]{.underline}**. An example of Cohen\'s method is to be found in his
1993 working paper, \`Home rules\', subtitled \`Some reflections on
racism and nation- alism in everyday life\'. Here Cohen talks about
taking a \`particular line of thought for a walk\'. While there is
nothing wrong with taking a line of thought for a walk, such an exercise
is not necessarily the same as thinking. One of the problems with
Cohen\'s approach is that a kind of free association, mixed with
deconstruction, leads not to analysis, not even to psychoanalysis, but
to . . . well, just more free association, an endless, indeed one might
say pointless, play on
words. [This]{.underline} [approach]{.underline} [may]{.underline} [well]{.underline} [throw
up some interesting associations along the way, connections one had
never thought of]{.underline} [but it is]{.underline} [**not to be
confused with political analysis**.]{.underline} In \`Home rules\',
anything and everything to do with \`home\' can and does ®nd a place
here and, as I indicated above, even the popular film Home Alone is
pressed into service as a story about \`racial\' invasion.

#### Psychoanalysis is wrong. -- it's based on completely bogus science

**Bunge**, McGill University philosopher, 20**10**

(Mario, "Should Psychoanalysis Be in the Science Museum?", 10-5,
http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20827806.200-should-psychoanalysis-be-in-the-science-museum.html)

We should congratulate the Science Museum for setting up an exhibition
on psychoanalysis. Exposure to pseudoscience greatly helps understand
genuine science, just as learning about tyranny helps in understanding
democracy. Over the past 30 years, psychoanalysis has quietly been
displaced in academia by scientific psychology. But it persists in
popular culture as well as being a lucrative profession. It is the
psychology of those who have not bothered to learn psychology, and the
psychotherapy of choice for those who believe in the power of immaterial
mind over body. [Psychoanalysis is a bogus science]{.underline} [because
its]{.underline} [practitioners do not
do]{.underline} [scientific]{.underline} [research. When the field
turned 100, a group of psychoanalysts admitted this gap and endeavoured
to fill it]{.underline}. They claimed to have performed the first
experiment showing that patients benefited from their
treatment. [Regrettably,]{.underline} [they did not include a control
group and did not entertain the possibility of placebo
effects.]{.underline} Hence, [their claim remains
untested]{.underline} (The International Journal of Psychoanalysis, vol
81, p 513). More recently[, a meta-analysis published in American
Psychologist]{.underline} (vol 65, p 98) [purported to support the claim
that a form of psychoanalysis]{.underline} called psychodynamic
therapy [is effective. However, once again, the original studies did not
involve control groups. In 110 years,]{.underline} [psychoanalysts have
not set up a single lab. They do not participate in scientific
congresses, do not submit their papers to scientific journals and are
foreign to
the]{.underline} [scientific]{.underline} [community]{.underline} [-
a]{.underline} [marginality typical of]{.underline} [pseudoscience. This
does not mean their hypotheses have never been put to the
test]{.underline}. True, [they are so vague that they
are]{.underline} [hard to test and some of them are,]{.underline} [by
Freud\'s own admission, irrefutable.]{.underline} Still, [most of the
testable ones have been soundly refuted.]{.underline} For example, [most
dreams have no sexual content. The Oedipus complex is a
myth]{.underline}; boys do not hate their fathers because they would
like to have sex with their mothers. [The list goes on]{.underline}. As
for therapeutic efficacy, little is known because psychoanalysts do not
perform double-blind clinical trials or follow-up
studies. [Psychoanalysis is a pseudoscience. Its concepts are woolly and
untestable yet are regarded as unassailable axioms. As a result of such
dogmatism, psychoanalysis has remained basically stagnant for more than
a century]{.underline}, in contrast with scientific psychology, which is
thriving.

Potential of an EU internal Indigenous Peoples Policy

[Coloniality]{.underline} in an EU context is [often only understood as
a legacy of the EU Member States]{.underline} while the
**[EU]{.underline}** [itself is **framed** as a post-**colonial**
project]{.underline}. Following Hansen and Jonsson34) though, the EU
needs to address its own colonial legacy and present more critically.
[Although the authors focus on entanglements between the history and
present of EU integration and the African continent]{.underline}, they
still hold an [interesting angle for the case of the Sámi
People]{.underline}. An [EU internal Indigenous Peoples
Policy]{.underline} could [support]{.underline} in **[addressing
colonial legacies]{.underline}** [internally through strengthening
Indigenous Peoples' right to **participate in EU
policy-making**.]{.underline} Early in the policy cycle process, an EU
internal perspective featuring a rightsholder [concept in
consultation]{.underline} and [participation fora]{.underline} could
help to [counter current dynamics of "judge-made law and only applying
law]{.underline}"35) that often only in a last step decide on the
compliance of development projects with national and international law.
Furthermore, setting a rights-based standard and policy framework at the
EU level could [also assist in addressing the issue of capacity on the
side of Sámi organisations]{.underline}. By [including Indigenous
Peoples' representatives]{.underline}, in our case Sámi representatives,
**[early in policy-making processes]{.underline}**36) and by
[**facilitating** meaningful and **rights-based
participation**]{.underline}, policy [outcomes]{.underline} [run less
the risk of being perceived as unjust and can reduce the probability of
cases being brought to court]{.underline}. A relevant angle could be
[setting rights-based standards]{.underline} in an EU internal
Indigenous Peoples Policy on [permitting processes that could be
implemented at the national level]{.underline} to **[better
ensure]{.underline}** [Sámi rights to **self-determination** already at
a higher governance level]{.underline}. For instance, the [EU could
develop targeted guidelines on the implementation of
policies]{.underline} in the field of renewable energy and mining,
stronger safeguards for EU funding and decision-making in the European
Investment Bank and guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessments and
Strategic Environmental Assessments addressing Sámi rights. Moreover,
[the Commission could **establish dialogues** with the Member States to
**raise** **awareness** on **Sámi rights** to land and
resources.]{.underline}

Against the backdrop of insights and experiences from the local,
regional and national level regarding 'dialogues',37) these [dialogues
need to acknowledge Indigenous Peoples as rightsholders
different]{.underline} from [other actors to better protect Indigenous
Peoples' rights to self-determination]{.underline}. Although the EU
neither designs the processes in the national context nor permits
licences, it still has an [agenda-setting power]{.underline} [using
"moral discourses of climate change mitigation]{.underline}"38) through
developing overarching policy frameworks. Thus, applying a rightsholder
[concept]{.underline} in EU policy-making could also [**strengthen**
**Indigenous**]{.underline} [**Peoples'** **rights** throughout the
governance levels]{.underline}, [underlining]{.underline} the relevance
of an [EU internal Indigenous Peoples Policy as a
framework.]{.underline}

However, currently the EU policies concerning the Arctic and Indigenous
Peoples cannot achieve their full potential on both the goal of
decarbonisation and on respecting the rights of Indigenous Peoples.
[Through an EU internal policy, **rights cannot only be protected but
can thrive**.]{.underline} Such a [policy cannot only support
rightsholders but also stakeholders,]{.underline} Member States and the
EU in fulfilling the legal commitments and in actually acting on
Indigenous Peoples' rights and knowledge systems. [This also includes
acknowledging that consultations can lead to a decision not to proceed
with development]{.underline} [projects]{.underline}, securing space for
both Indigenous livelihoods and other developments. [EU decisions, even
if]{.underline} [applied nationally, regionally, or locally, strongly
impact the Sámi People]{.underline}. Due to the Sámi's rights, including
the right to self-determination, which need to be ensured by all actors
at different governance levels following inter alia ILO No. 169 and
UNDRIP, not only the nation-states but also the EU needs to consult with
the Sámi People on issues that affect their right to
self-determination[. Current examples from **Sápmi** demonstrate the
**significant impact of EU policies**]{.underline} on [Sámi livelihoods
and the ne**ed to properly protect Sámi rights** to self-determination
under the green transition]{.underline}. **[Sámi
rightsholders]{.underline}** all over Sápmi, whether in Fovsen, Giron or
elsewhere, [could be **better protected** by streamlining Indigenous
Peoples' rights into EU policy-making]{.underline}. However, such an
internal perspective should not be considered a panacea. We understand
it as [a **first** but relevant **step** because it could link existing
policies while stressing a rightsholder concept.]{.underline} An EU
internal Indigenous Peoples policy could also contribute to
**[addressing the EU's colonial legacies]{.underline}** [and design more
meaningful dialogues with Indigenous Peoples beyond the case of the Sámi
people.]{.underline}

Conclusion and Outlook

In this article, we presented the rightsholder concept as a potential
tool to streamline Indigenous Peoples' rights into EU policy-making.
[Court cases and insights from research with Sámi representatives who
participated in consultation processes at lower governance level
s]{.underline}how that the [stakeholder concept applied to participation
does not, in practice, protect the rights of Indigenous
Peoples]{.underline}. Sámi representatives do not assess "dialogue"
processes as meaningful, which in many examples leads to so-called
judge-made law when rightsholders go to court. Dialogues remain
superficial, one-sided and often do not take into account Sámi
Indigenous knowledge.

[For nation-states and the EU as a whole, these legal uncertainties can
hamper the implementation of the European Green Deal.]{.underline} For
the Sámi People, [these legal means are linked to long processes that
decide if and how Sámi rightsholders can continue with their traditional
livelihoods]{.underline}. We identify an **[EU internal Indigenous
Peoples Policy]{.underline}** as [relevant for applying a rightsholder
concept in consultations]{.underline} and other forms of participation
at the EU level. It [would help the EU to **address** its **colonial**
**legacies** and could even **influence** through its framework setting
power other governance levels]{.underline} by establishing rights-based
standards at the EU level. [Ultimately, it **is in all actors'
interests** to ensure such legal certainty and follow laws protecting
Indigenous Peoples' rights to self-determination]{.underline}. An [EU
internal Indigenous Peoples Policy could **facilitate more just** and
sustainable **policy outcomes.**]{.underline}

#### Arctic policymaking is key. Collective Arctic action that engages with state actors allows for a ruptural break from neocolonialism and guides the stolen capital of the West back into Arctic control, especially over contingent issues like climate crisis.

31.2 A New Era of Arctic Cooperation

[[If we are to guide change]{.mark} in the Arctic]{.underline} rather
than merely become victims of it [or take on roles designed to appeal to
metropolitan sensibilities]{.underline}, it is [[necessary to
**accept**]{.mark} that **[change]{.mark}** is [occurring]{.mark} and
then **[commit]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [managing]{.mark} it.**]{.underline}
The Arctic is home to many peoples, who possess diverse sets of needs.
Yet [[we are **united**]{.mark} [by]{.mark} a number of shared -- if not
**[universal]{.mark}** -- [interests]{.mark}]{.underline}, which can be
supported through **[[collective action]{.underline}]{.mark}**, whether
[[through **formal**]{.mark} **[bodies]{.mark}** that can
**[engage]{.mark} with [sovereign]{.mark}** [**states**]{.mark} or
through looser, more flexible coalitions of actors]{.underline}. What is
clear is that [Arctic sustainability depends on [long-term
governance]{.mark}]{.underline} across national borders
[[transcending]{.underline}]{.mark} [[single]{.underline}]{.mark}
[state, corporate]{.underline}, or even [ethnic
[interests]{.mark}]{.underline}, in light of the **[remarkable
interdependence]{.underline}** of Arctic peoples and environments
surrounding their shared sea.

[As Arctic peoples]{.underline}, [[we]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[must]{.underline}]{.mark} [identify what we really want]{.underline}
so that we can begin **[[setting]{.mark} common
[targets]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} planning for and
**[[implementing]{.mark} strategic [actions]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and
**[[taking on]{.mark} strategic
[responsibilities]{.mark}]{.underline}**. By [[creating]{.mark} a true
Arctic [community]{.mark}]{.underline}, one that works at [[multiple
levels of **formality**]{.mark} and through multiple
channels]{.underline}, we can at last truly gain a voice (Plaut 2012).
[An [openness]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [informal]{.mark}
political]{.underline} [organisation]{.underline}
[[must]{.underline}]{.mark} [[complement]{.mark} a **dedication** to
constructing **[strong]{.mark}** institutional foundations for **[Arctic
policymaking]{.mark}** that reflects shared values and
priorities]{.underline}. As we work to define our own ethnic and
national identities, [we should seek to locate these within a wider
Arctic identity]{.underline}, one that can [enrich]{.underline} --
rather than overshadow -- our [localised values]{.underline}. Such a
multifaceted, [**[pan-Arctic]{.underline}**
**[policymaking]{.underline}**]{.mark} platform could
[[strengthen]{.mark} our [ability]{.mark} to [engage with]{.mark}
non-Arctic actors]{.underline} ([including]{.underline} metropolitan
interests within **[[states]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that possess Arctic
territory]{.underline}), which are both [affecting and affected by
changes taking place within the Arctic]{.underline}. This contrasts with
current regional bodies and institutions, which often take a broad
state-centric perspective (for example, the Arctic Council and the
Barents Euro-Arctic Council) or a narrow focus on Indigenous interests
(for example, the Inuit Circumpolar Council and the Indigenous Peoples'
Secretariat): Both such perspectives are necessary and important, but
the former places agency in the hands of the metropole while the latter
risks creating false divisions between Arctic communities, erroneously
grouping the interests of Arctic non-Indigenous peoples with those of
the metropole.

Arctic economic, societal, cultural, and political development must be
led by Arctic peoples themselves, working to develop peaceful and
constructive relationships at the community, state, and other levels. A
sense of a shared stake in the Arctic can even help foster better
relationships between Indigenous peoples and former colonisers,
supporting a decolonial Arctic politics that regards all Arctic peoples
as equal -- understanding the consequences of historic injustice without
perpetuating ethnic and political animosity. Understanding today's
Arctic and envisioning a future Arctic requires acknowledgment that,
across much of the North, "the institutional and ideological
interference of the colonial period directly or indirectly, subtly or
overtly, continues to influence political thought and economic agendas"
(Nadarajah and Grydehøj 2016: 442; see also Grydehøj 2016).

[[These **must not**]{.mark}, however, [be **decisions made by a
local**]{.mark} **[elite]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is
[important]{.underline} that the [entire]{.underline}
[population]{.underline} of the Arctic be [involved in the move toward
sustainable]{.underline} regional [development]{.underline} and come to
[understand the benefits to **collective action** and **collective
development.**]{.underline} At the same time, [desired
development]{.underline} outcomes [must be localised]{.underline}; [[no
longer]{.underline}]{.mark} can it be [[acceptable]{.underline}]{.mark}
for Arctic actors to [[pursue]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[competitive]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[zero-sum [games]{.mark} against
one another]{.underline}**. At the same time, as [we recognise that
shared development may require certain shared sacrifices]{.underline},
we must draw the line at sacrificing some communities solely in favour
of others.

31.3 Arctic Research and Education

This kind of [regional awareness and bottom-up
[policymaking]{.mark}]{.underline} [[requires]{.underline}]{.mark}
enhanced knowledge on the part of Arctic peoples and an **[[improved
connection between science and policymaking]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[Education]{.underline} is [key]{.underline} to this, with actors such
as UArctic working to [build local capacity through
education]{.underline}. Yet it is important to be conscious of
neocolonial forces within education systems and to prevent the
development of an Arctic cultural elite that is distanced from knowledge
of ordinary communities across the region. Development planning is
increasingly driven by systemitisation, data collection, and
technocratic discourses, which often combine to privilege metropolitan
interests and expertise, leading to local suspicion of development and
planning in general (Pugh 2013, 2016).

Without denying the importance of 'evidence-based policymaking', it is
necessary to recognise that, in today's world, not all kinds of evidence
are treated equally. In particular, the experiences of Arctic Indigenous
peoples, who have centuries or millennia of experience living in close
interaction with nature, can contribute lessons in flexible livelihoods
and adaptability to harsh and changing environments (e.g. Pearce et al.
2015). [**[Climate change]{.mark}**, for example, will have
[serious]{.mark} and possibly even [disastrous repercussions]{.mark} in
some parts of the world, but this [change]{.mark} will [need to be
**dealt with**]{.mark}, and its effects on Arctic environments and
peoples may not be straightforwardly negative]{.underline}. It is vital
that Arctic policy breaks free from the crippling strictures of
neoliberal risk, vulnerability, and resilience discourse (Evans and Reid

policymaking]{.mark}** that is [sensitive]{.mark} [to Arctic
conditions]{.mark} may [reach]{.mark} quite [different]{.mark}
[conclusions]{.mark} [than]{.mark} research and [**policymaking** with a
metropolitan orientation]{.mark}]{.underline}. The scientifically and
technocratically motivated drive toward 'modernisation' asks Arctic
Indigenous peoples to submit to a developmental model that has proved
environmentally calamitous on the global scale and that has been applied
elsewhere with such poor results in earlier periods of decolonisation.
Involvement of Arctic peoples in Arctic research is a necessary but
insufficient condition for truly locally oriented research: The
framework, expectations, and design of the research must itself be
decolonised.

[[Arctic peoples]{.mark} [require]{.mark} an emancipatory and decolonial
[system]{.mark} of research and education]{.underline}, which
[[neither]{.mark} [turns its back on]{.mark} knowledge and cutting-edge
[scholarship]{.mark} [nor]{.mark} find itself [trapped]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} preconceived [notions]{.mark} [regarding]{.mark} the
creation of [colonial]{.mark}]{.underline} (or postcolonial)
[[subjects]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[[Scientific]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[research]{.underline}]{.mark}** itself -- from the humanities,
social sciences, and natural sciences -- [[should be undertaken]{.mark}
by or in close engagement [with]{.mark} people from a diverse [range of
communities]{.mark}]{.underline}, who can both contribute their own
perspectives to the wider scientific world and better communicate
findings to their own communities (Mulligan and Nadarajah 2008).
[**[Greater investment]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} Arctic [science]{.mark} is
**[critical for achieving Arctic sustainability]{.mark}** -- but [only
if]{.mark} this [science has]{.mark} firm [roots]{.mark} in Arctic
[communities.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Arctic peoples share a number of cultural values but also possess
cultural distinctions from one another, which produces a rich seam of
traditional and Indigenous knowledge that can be drawn upon in
developing Arctic research and education. [**[Truly Arctic
research]{.mark}** and **[education]{.mark} [does not]{.mark}**
[**involve** **rejecting science** or **Western**]{.mark}
**[learning]{.mark}**;]{.underline} it instead [[**involves** the
**investment** of such knowledge with local values]{.mark} in order to
better serve local needs.]{.underline} To paraphrase Grant McCall
(1994[),]{.mark} Arctic studies must consider Arctic peoples on their
own terms, not on those of metropolitan well-wishers, development
workers, or political authorities.

31.4 Towards an Arctic Awakening

Global change is producing new challenges for peoples of the Arctic, but
it is also bringing us closer together. We cannot simply draw the line
at the individual community, ethnic group, nation, or even state: It is
vital for us all to get engaged with the shared Arctic project. By
grasping the necessity of change, we can enter a new era of regional
stability, shared purpose, and political power.

**[Change is coming.]{.underline}** We may find it daunting, yet [it is
up to us, the peoples of the Arctic, to say:]{.underline} [**We will
no** **longer be passive observers** of our development but **will take
charge of our futures.**]{.underline}

#### "Sovereignty" in the Western frame is not inevitable. Biases are shifting now and confronting climate change in the Arctic represents a unique opportunity to move to a collaborative model.

Fourth, **[sovereignty is contextual]{.underline}**. In the
**[Arctic]{.underline}**, [this implies that any notion of **shared
sovereignty** specifically in the Arctic must include Indigenous
people]{.underline}, their traditional and ecological knowledge, and the
**[co-managing of Arctic issues]{.underline}**. Scholars acknowledge
that **[sovereignty is constantly evolving]{.underline}** and thus we
[should not use outdated terminology]{.underline} to describe a region
when it is no longer useful (MacFarlane & Sabanadze, 2013; Glanville,
2013). [It is not as though sovereignty has not already adapted and been
changed with other alterations]{.underline}. The [European
Union]{.underline}, for example, [does not fit within the traditional
bounds of sovereignty]{.underline}. It operates as somewhat of a
[hybrid]{.underline} that follows some [older rules]{.underline} but
also **[adapts to the type of sovereignty]{.underline}** [that the
European Union represents]{.underline}. The [Arctic]{.underline}
similarly [should be an opportunity]{.underline} [for
sovereignty]{.underline} to **[evolve and]{.underline}**
**[address]{.underline}** [both the changing role of
geography]{.underline} and [Indigenous peoples]{.underline} alongside a
[**new conception** of **shared sovereignty** as well as deal with the
**very real threat of climate change**.]{.underline}

#### Indigenous understandings of land do not preclude interaction with the state. Cooperation shifts the frame of lawmaking and allows us to solve rising issues in the Arctic.

Third, [Arctic policymakers and scholars should consider that shared
sovereignty may be a more equitable and historically grounded version of
Arctic sovereignty]{.underline}. From an Indigenous perspective,
[sovereignty]{.underline} has a **[different meaning]{.underline}** and
can be [helpful here when imagining how a shared sovereignty can work in
the real world.]{.underline} First, Indigenous [conceptions of
sovereignty are social and cultural ways of understanding
community]{.underline} -- and thus sovereignty is often linked to an
ability to carry out normal life activities. Therefore, [shared
sovereignty in the Arctic can reflect that, **acknowledging** that
geopolitical **competition** and increased oil and gas extraction are
threats to that sovereignty]{.underline}. Second, [Indigenous
approaches]{.underline} to sovereignty also [take a **relational
approach,**]{.underline} thinking [about how **land and people
interrelate** and the importance of being heard in deliberations between
people]{.underline}. In action, this could mean **[focusing more on the
Arctic institutions that exist]{.underline}** and [giving more power to
Indigenous People in those institutions to be heard and
speak]{.underline} rather than giving power to states alone. In a future
[**Arctic** that will be inevitably changed by the **advent of climate
change**]{.underline}, [people and **collectives** will have to **work
together** to solve these larger collective-action
problems.]{.underline} This feeds into a third way that Indigenous
sovereignty can inform shared sovereignty. While Westphalian sovereignty
treats land as an exploitable resource[, Indigenous sovereignty sees
land as something to be cared for, the other part of a reciprocal
relationship between people and land.]{.underline} What use is having
sovereignty over a place if it is not cared for or is not productive?
[Shared sovereignty in action here would be a **reframing of the
Arctic** as a place for cooperative action to care for the land as the
primary objective of sovereignty.]{.underline}

By [placing **climate change** within disaster risk
reduction]{.underline}, while using the prominence of climate change to
promote and achieve wider development agendas, a long-term perspective
is supported in which related research better serves policy and
practice---and vice versa. [The **long-term perspective** further
assists in **addressing the vulnerability process** and the **resilience
process**]{.underline}. An historical perspective [avoids being
distracted by a myopic concentration on climate change]{.underline},
instead [directing attention to **root causes** and the **fundamentals
of vulnerability** and resilience as long-**term
processes**.]{.underline} [Research, policy, and practice]{.underline}
would move forward [in concert by accepting the widespread, long-term
causes and consequences of vulnerability]{.underline} and resilience
from multiple sources and requiring multiple, integrated interventions.

Achieving this theoretical approach in practice [would set aside and
move beyond vocabulary differences]{.underline}, instead bringing
together the 2015 processes under the common banner of sustainability.
Oliver-Smith (1979) referred to a 400-year earthquake in examining the
31 May 1970 earthquake and rock avalanche in Yungay, Peru that killed
thousands of the city's inhabitants. [The "**400 year" timeframe** is
not the geological return period of the seismic or avalanche
event.]{.underline} Instead, it refers to the fact that the **[root
causes of the vulnerability]{.underline}**, which were [exposed as a
result of the event]{.underline}, took 400 years to build up---[a
long-term process.]{.underline} The vulnerability that caused the
disaster can be traced back to the Spanish conquest of the region, in
terms of demographics, settlement locations, and ways of
living---[exactly the aspects that the Sustainable Development Goals aim
to address.]{.underline} [No longer must ways of living]{.underline} and
livelihoods be [categorized as vulnerability]{.underline} and/or
resilience, [but instead they are accepted as supporting multiple
sustainability goals, tackling multiple exposure.]{.underline}

Expanding the school and hospital examples at the end of the previous
section, disaster risk reduction is not the ultimate endeavour. A school
that withstands multiple hazards might not achieve development and
sustainability goals if only boys are permitted to attend. A hospital
built with all disaster risk reduction considerations, including with
climate change adaptation factored in, but serving only the most
affluent people, sets back development by expanding the rich-poor gap.

[Consequently, although the role of climate change is to be positioned
within disaster risk reduction, disaster risk reduction's future is to
be a subset of wider development and sustainability
processes.]{.underline} Having three separate streams for international
negotiations duplicates efforts and disperses energy. But given this
situation, bringing them all together would be challenging; for
instance, the climate change negotiations seek a legally binding accord
ratified by world parliaments while the disaster risk reduction process
and the Sustainable Development Goals aim for voluntary agreements. None
of the three has yet articulated a verifiable monitoring and enforcement
mechanism, although that could potentially develop. With effort and
will, these practical difficulties could be overcome, although
territorialism and vested interests are likely to preclude such action.

The [theoretical strength of climate change sitting within disaster risk
reduction]{.underline}, which in [turn sits within development and
sustainability]{.underline}, can lead to **[positive policy and practice
outcomes.]{.underline}** This [approach would represent a **vision for
disaster risk reduction's future,** ending tribalism and separation in
order to work]{.underline} [together to achieve common
goals]{.underline}. Although the [prospect of this integrated approach
occurring seems unlikely,]{.underline} not despite but because of the
three 2015 processes and their long histories, [the **momentum**
of]{.underline} three independent but overlapping institutional paths
[**should not stop** **us** from doing our best to bring all areas
together in order to save humanity from itself.]{.underline}

Criticisms

By the late 1980s, **[deep ecology]{.underline}** had attracted both a
popular following and a number of critics. [One group that brought both
energy and scrutiny to deep ecology was Earth First!,]{.underline} a
[radical]{.underline}, [decentralized]{.underline}
[resistance]{.underline} movement born in 1979 out of frustration with
the ineffectiveness of mainstream environmentalism and a passionate
dedication to protecting wild places. Earth First! [practiced effective
civil disobedience]{.underline} actions such as tree-sitting [and road
blockades, and occupation of logging sites to protect old-growth
forests.]{.underline}

But some Earth First! campaigns also employed [more aggressive
tactics]{.underline}, including acts of [sabotage]{.underline}, such as
tree spiking to stop logging and other forms of environmental
destruction.

Another [controversial environmental organization]{.underline} called
the [Earth Liberation Front,]{.underline} whose loosely affiliated
[members]{.underline} have [conducted]{.underline} sabotage, including
[arson]{.underline}, in support of environmental protection also
supports principles of deep ecology.5﻿ The tactic[s of some activists
associated with these groups provided fuel for anti-environmental
politicians]{.underline} and organizations to [denounce them along with
deep ecology]{.underline}, though there was [never absolute
alignment]{.underline} between the deep ecology movement and any single
group.6﻿

Should Ecocentrism Be the Goal?

Another [critique of deep ecology]{.underline} came from scholars and
adherents of social ecology. Murray Bookchin, the founder of social
ecology, [persistently rejected deep ecology's biocentric
orientation]{.underline} that regards [humans as an outsized threat to
non-human life on the planet.7﻿]{.underline} Bookchin, among others,
considered this a [misanthropic]{.underline} [view]{.underline}. He and
other [social ecology supporters maintained]{.underline} that it is
[capitalism]{.underline} and class [differences]{.underline}, not human
beings categorically, that [pose the fundamental threat to the
planet]{.underline}. Thus, mitigating the ecological crisis requires a
transformation of class-based, hierarchical, patriarchal societies from
which environmental destruction stems.

Other prominent [critics also question deep ecology's vision of pristine
wilderness]{.underline}, challenging this as utopian and even
**[undesirable]{.underline}**. Some [consider it a **western**,
**preservationist perspective** harmful to the poor, the marginalized,
and to Indigenous peoples]{.underline} [and others whose material and
cultural survival is closely tied to the land.]{.underline}

In 1989, the Indian historian and ecologist Ramachandra
[Guha]{.underline} published an [influential critique of
deep]{.underline} [ecology]{.underline} in the journal Environmental
Ethics.8﻿ In it, he analyzed the role [of deep ecology in shifting U.S.
wilderness advocacy in particular toward a more radical platform and
scrutinized its misappropriation of Eastern religious
traditions.9﻿]{.underline}

Guha argued that this misappropriation had arisen in part from a desire
to present deep ecology as universal when it was in fact distinctly
western, with notably imperialist qualities. He warned of the
[potential]{.underline} [damage]{.underline} associated with [applying
the ideology]{.underline} of [wilderness preservation in developing
countries without considering the impacts particularly on poor people
who directly depended on the environment for subsistence.]{.underline}

Similarly, [ecofeminist critics of deep ecology have]{.underline}
[raised]{.underline} concerns about deep ecology's
[emphasis]{.underline} on setting aside **[pristine
wilderness]{.underline}**, which they [contend may lead to social
injustice, including]{.underline} [displacement, for women and other
groups with less decision-making power]{.underline}. Ecofeminism, which
arose as a roughly contemporaneous movement in the 1970s, draws
connections between the exploitation, commodification, and degradation
of nature and that of women in a patriarchal society, according to the
scholar Mary Mellor in her 1998 book "Feminism and Ecology."10﻿

Although the [two movements have much in common,
**ecofeminists**]{.underline} have **[criticized deep
ecology]{.underline}** for [failing to make explicit connections between
**men's domination of nature** and domination of women and other
marginalized groups]{.underline}, and how [gender
inequality]{.underline} [contributes]{.underline} to [environmental
destruction.11﻿]{.underline}

Unintended Consequences

[Deep ecology]{.underline} also sparked [controversy]{.underline} for
its call to [substantially decrease the global population]{.underline}
to [address]{.underline} humanity's voracious [natural resource
consumption]{.underline}, which [damages]{.underline} the
[environment]{.underline} and leads [to social inequality, conflict, and
**human suffering**]{.underline}. This raised concerns about the
[potential]{.underline} for **[human rights abuses]{.underline}** if
[draconian controls like forced abortion and sterilization]{.underline}
were [imposed]{.underline} to reduce global population. The deep
[ecology platform itself did not endorse such extreme
measures;]{.underline} Næss emphatically pointed to the first principle
of deep ecology---respect for all life---as evidence of this. But the
call for population control was a lightning rod.

[Earth First! drew ire in the 1980s for publishing]{.underline} (though
not necessarily endorsing) arguments [suggesting that **famine and
disease**]{.underline} could [be effective at **reducing the global
population**]{.underline}. Bookchin and others publicly denounced such
views as eco-fascism. In addition, Bookchin and others forcefully
countered xenophobic arguments by Edward Abbey, celebrated nature writer
and author of "The Monkeywrench Gang," that Latin American immigration
to the United States posed environmental threats.12﻿

In the 2019 book "The [Far Right and the Environment,"
social]{.underline} ecology scholar Blair Taylor described how
[**overpopulation** and **immigration** from the global south have long
been **anxieties** of right-wing extremists as well]{.underline}.13﻿14﻿
Over time, he wrote, some from the [so-called alternative
right]{.underline} have come to [**embrace deep ecology** and other
environmental ideologies to **justify xenophobia and white
supremacy**]{.underline}.

[Environmentalism]{.underline} has become a [more prominent theme in
**right-wing immigration rhetoric**]{.underline}. A recent [Arizona
lawsuit advocates for a more restrictive immigration
policy,]{.underline} [claiming]{.underline} the [immigrant]{.underline}
population is [contributing to climate change and other forms of
environmental degradation.]{.underline} And an analysis of [far-right
parties]{.underline} in [Europe]{.underline} [identified]{.underline} an
emerging discourse that blames [immigration]{.underline} for
[environmental damage]{.underline} rather than wealthy industrialized
nations that are by far the largest contributors to the current
ecological crisis.15﻿

None of these ideas are part of the deep ecology platform. Indeed, in a
2019 article for The Conversation, University of Michigan historian and
author Alexandra Minna Stern traced ecofascism to the early 20th
century, described the long history of white anxieties about
overpopulation and immigration, and wrote how [right-wing
extremists]{.underline} have tried to [assert]{.underline}
[environmental]{.underline} protection as the [exclusive domain of
white]{.underline} men. "Jettisoning Næss' belief in the value of
biological diversity," she wrote, "far-right thinkers have perverted
deep ecology, imagining that the world is intrinsically unequal and that
racial and gender hierarchies are part of nature's design."

In Stern's recent book, \"Proud Boys and the White Ethnostate,\" she
explains how a [white nationalist]{.underline} [version of deep ecology
has **served as inspiration for** **violence**]{.underline}, including
the 2019 shootings at two New Zealand mosques and a Walmart in El Paso,
Texas. Both shooters referenced environmental concerns in justifying
their murderous rampages. "[Their crusade to save white people from
erasure through multiculturalism and immigration mirrors their crusade
to preserve nature from environmental destruction and
overpopulation,"]{.underline} Stern explained in The Conversation.

and **political activism of Arne Naess\'s Deep Ecology**]{.underline} in
the [search]{.underline} for a [Philosophy]{.underline} [capable of

capitalism and for the deculturalized and deterritorialized man.

7-21-2025//St. Marks Adam

[The]{.underline} basic [idea of terror management theory
is]{.underline} that humans are aware of their own mortality and that
[thoughts about one's own death elicit **fear**. To cope with this fear
or anxiety, humans engage in **various behaviors** that reduce death
anxiety]{.underline}. To study these effects, participants in
experimental studies are either asked to think about death or some other
unpleasant event (e.g., dental visits). Numerous studies show
statistically significant effects of these manipulations on a variety of
measures.

Figure 1 shows that [terror management research has **grown
exponentially**]{.underline}. Although the rate of publications is
leveling off, citations are still increasing exponentially.

\[FIGURE OMITTED\]

[[While]{.mark} the **growth** of terror management [research
**suggests**]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[the theory]{.mark} rests on a
**large** body of evidence, [it is **not**]{.mark} **clear** whether
this evidence is **[trustworthy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The reason is
that [[psychologists]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[used a
**biased**]{.underline}]{.mark} statistical [**[procedure]{.mark}** to
test theories]{.underline}. When a statistically significant result is
obtained, the results are written up and submitted for publication.
However, [when the results are **not** significant]{.underline} and do
not support a prediction, [the results]{.underline} typically [remain
**unpublished**]{.underline}. It has been pointed out a long time ago,
that [this bias can produce **entire**]{.underline}ly [**literatures**
with significant results in the absence of a real effects]{.underline}
(Rosenthal, 1979).

[Recent advances in **[stat]{.mark}**istical method**[s]{.mark}** make
it possible to [examine]{.mark} the **[strength of
evidence]{.mark}**]{.underline} for a theory [[after taking
**publication bias** into account]{.underline}]{.mark}. To use this
method, I searched Web of Science for articles with the topic "terror
management". This search retrieved 2,394 articles. I then searched for
matching articles in a database of 121 psychology journals that includes
all major social psychology journals (Schimmack, 2022). This search
produced a list of 259 articles. I then searched these 259 articles for
statistical tests and converted the results of these tests into absolute
z-scores as a measure of the strength of evidence against the
null-hypothesis. Figure 2 shows the z-curve plot of the 4,014 results.

\[FIGURE OMITTED\]

The [[z-curve]{.underline}]{.mark} shows a peak at the criterion for
statistical significance (z = 1.96 equals p = .05, two-tailed). This
peak is not a natural phenomenon. It rather [[reflects]{.mark} the
**[selective reporting]{.mark}** of supporting evidence]{.underline}.
Whereas the published results show 72% significant results, the z-curve
model that is fitted to the distribution of significant z-scores
estimates that studies had only 14% power to produce significant
results. This difference between the observed discovery rate of 72% and
the expected discovery rate of 14% shows that [[unscientific practices
**dramatically inflate**]{.mark} the [evidence]{.mark} in favor of
terror management theory. This means reported effect sizes are
**inflated**]{.underline}. Moreover, an expected discovery rate of 14%
implies that up to 32% of the significant results could be false
positive results that were obtained without any real effect. The upper
limit of the 95% confidence interval even allows for 71% false positive
results. The problem is that [it is **unclear** which published results
produced real findings that **could be replicated**]{.underline}. Thus,
it is currently unclear how reminders of death influence human behavior.

\[FIGURE OMITTED\]

One limitation of the method used to generate Figure 2 is the automatic
extraction of all test results from articles. A better method uses
hand-coding of focal hypothesis tests of terror management theory.
Fortunately, an independent team of researchers conducted a
**[[hand-coding]{.mark} analysis]{.underline}** of terror management
studies (Chen, Benjamin, Lai, & Heine, 2022).

The results mostly [[confirm]{.underline}]{.mark} the results of the
automated analysis. The key difference is that [the selection for
significance effect is **even more evident** because [researchers
**hardly ever** report non-significant results]{.mark}]{.underline} for
focal hypothesis tests. The observed discovery rate of 95% is consistent
with analyses by Sterling over 50 years ago (Sterling, 1959). Moreover,
most of the non-significant results are in the range between z = 1.65 (p
= .10) and z = 1.96 (p = .05) that are often used as evidence to reject
the null-hypothesis. While the observed discovery rate in published
articles is nearly 100%, [the]{.underline} expected [discovery
rate]{.underline} is only 9% and the 95%CI includes 5%, which [is
expected by **chance alone**]{.underline}. Thus, [[the data provide
**no**]{.mark} **credible [evidence]{.mark}** [for **any**]{.mark}
**terror management [effects]{.mark}**]{.underline} and [it is
**possible**]{.underline} that [**[100% of the]{.mark} significant
[results]{.mark}** [are **false positive**]{.mark} result[**s** without
**any**]{.mark} **real [effect]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### [Meta-analyses]{.underline} comprehensively refute the impact.

2018). Using similar criteria, the "Many Labs" projects conducted
high-powered replications of non-randomly sampled studies, yielding
variable rates of success: Many Labs 1 (Klein et al., 2014): 10/13, Many
Labs 2 (Klein et al., 2018): 14/28, Many Labs 3 (Ebersole et al., 2016):
3/10, Many Labs 5 (Ebersole et al., 2020): 2/10. [There are
ma]{.underline}ny possible contributors to failures to replicate,
including publication bias or p-hacking in original research,
unidentified moderators that differ between the original and
replication, and failures to effectively implement the replication
studies. Shortcomings in implementation could occur by failing to
transfer knowledge of key features of the study methods to replication
teams.

[We sought to evaluate whether involving original authors
in]{.underline} selection and design could improve
[replication]{.underline} success. To do so, we selected an important
theory that is also considered sensitive to the procedures necessary to
elicit its effects: **[Terror Management Theory]{.underline}** (TMT;
Greenberg et al., 1986, 1994). [TMT considers the **psychological
consequences** of [being **reminded** of]{.mark}]{.underline} one's
impending [[death]{.underline}]{.mark}. This topic has spawned hundreds
of publications, some with more than 1,000 citations. TMT states that as
humans evolved self-awareness, they also came to know that their death
is inevitable. To avoid preoccupation with thoughts of death or feelings
of meaninglessness, one must manage the potential terror caused by this
knowledge (Becker, 1973, 1975). Greenberg, Pyszczynski, and Solomon
(1986) proposed that self-esteem is the buffer to these intrusive
thoughts, and that the purpose of self-esteem is to manage terror
related to mortality. TMT has been applied to understand human
activities such as religion (e.g., belief in an afterlife grants literal
immortality, alleviating mortality terror; Jonas & Fischer, 2006),
cultural identity (e.g., belief in being part of a greater good that
will persist after death; Greenberg et al., 1990), and inter-group
conflict (Burke et al., 2010). TMT experts also indicated that there was
substantial nuance required in implementing a successful TMT study, and
at least one doubted it could be captured in a "Many Labs" style project
at all. These nuances include how the experimenter delivers the
experimental script (tone, manner), precise design of materials,
accounting for contextual details, and other aspects which were refined
over years. However, there has never been a systematic investigation of
the replicability of TMT findings.

To investigate whether author involvement could improve replicability,
we engaged experts in three phases of research design. First, we
conducted a community-based search for an important area of research
that requires expertise for effective implementation and had experts
willing to contribute to replication. TMT met these criteria.

Second, [we consulted with]{.underline} TMT **[experts]{.underline}** --
Tom Pyszczynski and Sheldon Solomon -- to identify a seminal study
appropriate for replication (Jeff Greenberg later contributed to the
design of the study materials). Candidate studies had to take 30 minutes
or less, be administered on pencil-and-paper or computerized, and
preferably have two or fewer between-subjects conditions to maximize
statistical power. We sought studies that had room for researcher
flexibility in design, were theoretically central to TMT, and had
reasonably high expectations of replicability. In consultation with
experts, we selected Study 1 from Greenberg, Pyszczynski, Solomon,
Simon, and Breus (1994). This paper is highly influential (1252
citations on Google Scholar as of January 14, 2022), and Study 1 used a
prototypical mortality salience manipulation: writing about one's own
death, which 79.8% of studies in the field of TMT have used (Burke et
al., 2010).

Third, [original authors were **instrumental**]{.underline} for
designing the "Author Advised" version of the replication protocol. The
goal was to leverage all possible expertise to design a study with the
greatest chance of replicating the original effect. All parts of the
description, implementation, and analysis plan for this Author Advised
protocol were reviewed by at least one original author before data
collection began.

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

To investigate whether author involvement increases replicability, we
recruited 21 teams and randomly assigned them to either administer the
Author Advised protocol or to develop and administer their own "In
House" protocol to samples that they recruited. In House protocols were
designed without contact with the original authors, other teams
participating in the project, or other domain experts. Each lab was
responsible for collecting data from at least 80 participants to ensure
a high degree of statistical power when aggregating across sites.1 At
some labs, when separate principal investigators were identified to
administer independent replications, both In House and Author Advised
protocols were conducted. With this design, we examined the following
questions: 1. Can we successfully replicate a central finding supporting
TMT? We replicated Study 1 of Greenberg et al. (1994) in 17 labs with
1,578 participants (after exclusions). At minimum, this provides a
high-powered test, for all but very small effect sizes, of this
important finding. 2. Does original author involvement improve
replicability? The selected study (Greenberg et al., 1994, Study 1) left
ample room for non-experts to miss potentially critical aspects of
implementation. For example, the original paper deviated somewhat in
materials from the eventual Author Advised replication implementation
and contained little of the advice regarding lab context and setup. We
tested whether the Author Advised protocol was more effective at
eliciting statistically significant and larger effect magnitudes than In
House protocols. 3. Does a standardized, author-reviewed protocol
produce less variability across data collection sites? We hypothesized
that a standardized implementation of the Author Advised protocol across
sites would result in less variation in results compared to the In House
protocols because the In House protocols would likely have substantial
variability in procedures. Method Study 1 of Greenberg et al. (1994)
provided evidence that reminders of death induce worldview defense, and
that this effect was stronger when the reminders of death were
comparatively subtle (i.e., thinking about one's own death) than when
reminders of death were more emotionally salient (i.e., thinking about
one's own death and reflecting on their deepest feelings about dying).
In the original study, a total of 59 introductory psychology students in
the United States were randomly assigned between five conditions. Our
replication focused on the two conditions that were most effective in
the original paper: the condition labeled "subtle own death salient" and
the "TV salient" (control) condition. The outcome of interest was
evaluations of pro- vs. anti-American essay authors. Specifically,
participants in the death salient condition reported a greater
preference for the pro-American essay author over the anti-American
essay author, compared to participants in the control condition.
Participants in both conditions were told that the study session was
composed of two separate studies. In the "first study," participants
completed two filler measures and the mortality salience or control
manipulation. Participants in the condition described as "subtle own
death salient" wrote about the emotions they experienced when thinking
about their own death, and about what would happen to their physical
body as they were dying and once they were dead. Participants in the "TV
salient" condition received similar writing prompts, but instead
described the emotions they would experience while watching television,
and what they thought happened to their physical body as they watched
television. Participants then completed the Positive and Negative Affect
Schedule (PANAS; Watson et al., 1988). In a so-called "unrelated second
study" during the same session, participants read two brief essays
ostensibly written by international students. One essay was pro-American
and the other was anti-American. For the dependent variables,
participants answered three questions evaluating each essay's author,
and two questions evaluating the essay itself. The present replication
focused on evaluations of the author because that showed the strongest
effect in the original study. A composite rating of the author was
created by subtracting the mean of the three anti-American items from
the mean of the three pro-American items. A pairwise comparison revealed
that participants in the "subtle own death salient" condition showed a
greater preference for the pro-American author than for the
anti-American author (Mean Diff = 12.25). This was compared to
participants in the "TV salient" (control) condition (Mean Diff = 1.64),
t(53) = 4.87, p \< .001, Cohen's d = 1.34 (Greenberg et al., 1994).
Notable Differences from Original. The replication included just two of
the five conditions from the original ("subtle own death salient" and
"TV salient") and focused on just the evaluations of the essay authors
(disregarding any evaluations of the essays themselves). Because this
mortality salience condition may not be considered particularly subtle,
and is described in the original paper as their usual mortality salience
induction, we will refer to this condition simply as the mortality
salience condition from here on. The replication studies were
administered in the US Fall of 2016 and Spring of 2017. Procedure for
Author Advised Protocol. All materials and instructions used in the
study are available on the OSF page (https://osf.io/bq4n4/), as well as
instructions and detailed procedures and advice provided to Author
Advised sites. For the replication, we made several changes to the
original protocol as requested by the original authors: 1. The
Anti-American essay was adjusted to be more forceful and extreme, to
ensure it conflicted with the average participant's worldview. 2. The
filler-task portion of the study was extended to include additional
surveys and increase the delay between the mortality salience induction
and essay evaluation. 3. The procedure tried to put participants into a
relaxed, experiential mood. Precise language was included in the expert
instructions packets and included recommendations such as selectively
choosing relaxed research assistants to administer the study, using a
covered box for handing in packets to ensure a feeling of
confidentiality, separating participants into different cubicles or
rooms, and having experimenters act and dress casually. 4. Additional
demographic items were added to the end of the survey to apply exclusion
criteria. The Author Advised protocol was always administered in person
and in individual cubicles or small groups. When participants first
entered the room, they were read a prepared script that included a cover
story that the study consisted of two parts, and statements assuring
participants of the anonymity of their responses to reduce demand
characteristics. Participants were instructed to complete the first half
of the survey, and then return the completed form to a covered box
before being given the second survey. Then, participants were seated and
given the second packet of materials. The first materials packet started
by reassuring participants that their responses were confidential, and
that they should respond naturally: "On the following pages you will
find a series of personality, attitude and judgment questionnaires.
There are no right or wrong, or good or bad answers; rather different
responses reflect different personalities, attitudes and judgment
styles. Please respond honestly and naturally to each question and
complete the questionnaires in the order that they appear in the packet.
Your responses to these questions are completely anonymous and will be
used for research purposes only." Then, participants completed a 23-item
"personality inventory" included as a distractor, in which participants
answered "Yes" or "No" to items such as, "Does your mood often go up or
down?" They also completed a 12-item measure modeled after the Personal
Need for Structure Scale (Thompson et al., 2001), which was also
included primarily as a distractor. Participants responded on a 6-point
scale (1 -- strongly disagree to 6 -- strongly agree) to items like "It
upsets me to go into a situation without knowing what I can expect from
it." After this, participants completed the mortality salience or TV
(control) induction. Prior to the induction text, participants were
again reminded to respond naturally: "On the following page there are a
couple of open-ended questions. Please respond to them with your first,
natural response. We are just looking for people's gut-level reactions
to these questions." Participants in the mortality salience condition
then responded to two open-ended items disguised as "The Projective Life
Attitudes Assessment." The first item asked participants to "Please
briefly describe the emotions that the thought of your own death arouses
in you," while the second item asked participants to "Jot down, as
specifically as you can, what you think will happen to you physically as
you die and once you are physically dead." Participants in the TV
(control) condition responded to nearly identical items, which instead
asked about their emotions experienced while watching television and
what happens to them as they watch television. Participants then
completed the PANAS-X (Watson & Clark, 1994), a 60-item measure of
current emotional state in which they indicated the degree to which they
currently felt each of 60 emotions on a 5-point scale (1 -- very
slightly or not at all to 5 -- extremely), and the
Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (Horne & Ostberg, 1975) which is a
19-item scale assessing the degree to which participants performed
better in the morning or evening. Example items included: "What time
would you get up if you were entirely free to plan your day?" and, "What
time would you go to bed if you were entirely free to plan your
evening?" The purpose of these two scales was to provide "filler" time
between the induction and the essay evaluations. This concluded the
"first half" of the study and the first materials packets. After the
participant handed in the first packet, they were provided the second
packet of materials, matched by a participant number. Participants read
a cover story that indicated the university had collected writing
samples of impressions of America from international students attending
the university. Participants then read two essays, in counterbalanced
order across participants. One essay was relatively pro-U.S. and the
other was relatively critical of the U.S. Participants rated each essay
and its author on a five-item, 9-point scale (1 = "not at all" to 9 =
"extremely). Example items include"To what extent do you think the essay
makes valid points?" and "How intelligent do you think the person who
wrote this essay is?". Procedures for In House Protocols. The In House
protocols were created independently by each participating lab.
Instructions provided to these labs are available on the OSF page
(https://osf.io/drfg2/). To the best of their ability, and using only
the original paper, relevant literature, and any other publicly
available resources, each lab designed their own replication protocol of
the assigned study. The labs were prohibited from contacting the
original authors, other experts, and the other participating labs. The
only outside review was by the project leaders to confirm that the
correct study was being replicated and that the resulting data
collection would yield all variables necessary for the basic analysis
plan. The In House protocols differed substantially, both from one
another and as compared to the standardized Author Advised protocol. For
example, 7 In House labs used the PANAS as a filler task between the
manipulation and the dependent variables; the other 5 labs included no
filler task at all. None of the In House labs used the same set of
filler tasks as the Author Advised version, which included the PANAS and
second unrelated questionnaire. All 12 In House labs collected data
using a computer instead of pencil-and-paper, a design explicitly
discouraged by the original authors for the Author Advised version. We
summarize major attributes of the designs of all In House sites in Table
2. All materials used at In House sites and videos documenting their
implementation are available at http://osf.io/8ccnw/ to facilitate
review of the varying procedural implementations. Study Administration.
Within each lab, participants were randomly assigned to either the
mortality salience or control condition of the given protocol. At three
universities, both protocols were administered by independent groups of
researchers (to maintain blinding to the Author Advised materials). At
those sites, the groups recruited participants separately, but
randomized participants between conditions in their given protocol. Each
collaborating lab was responsible for recruiting at least 80
participants for their assigned protocol. Participants were prohibited
from participating in the study more than once. Provisions for Quality
Control As in previous iterations of the "Many Labs" projects (e.g.,
Ebersole et al., 2016, 2020; Klein et al., 2014, 2018), we employed
quality control and accountability standards for each lab's data
collection. Each site was required to film a mock session of the data
collection in which the researcher filmed a mock participant walking
through the steps as if they were actually taking the study. These
videos allowed a more thorough documentation of the lab spaces and any
idiosyncratic differences in protocol. In addition, sites were
responsible for ensuring all experimenters in direct contact with
participants were blind to the participant's condition assignment.
Collaborators also completed an experimenter survey assessing their
expertise, expectations, and motivations for joining the collaboration.
The survey and videos are available at https://osf.io/8ccnw/. At the end
of the Author Advised protocol, participants filled out demographic
information. Three of these items were included at the request of
original authors: importance of American identity, country of birth, and
race. In House protocols were asked to collect similar demographic
information (see https://osf.io/drfg2/), but these were described
minimally to avoid influencing design decisions. The American identity
item was omitted entirely. As a result, demographic data from In House
sites were not entirely comparable to demographic data from Author
Advised sites. Participants Twenty-one labs from 18 universities
participated in the project and collected data from a total of 2,281
participants. Several overall exclusions were made, each as specified by
our preregistration: https://osf.io/4xx6w. First, data from four labs
were excluded for collecting fewer than 60 participants.2 This excluded
158 participants. Next, some In House sites began data collection before
the analysis plan was pre-registered due to their own deadlines. Data
collected before the pre-registration were excluded from the
confirmatory tests reported in this manuscript. This excluded a further
545 participants.3 From the remaining 17 labs and 1,578 participants, in
adherence to our pre-registration, we excluded from all analyses
participants who either failed to complete all 6 ratings of the essay
authors, or who failed to complete both writing prompts within the
mortality salience or control conditions (e.g., the between-subjects
manipulation). The latter exclusion criteria applied only to
participants from Author Advised sites, because the necessary data was
not always available for In House sites. Thus, the usable sample
included 1,550 participants (see Table 1 for a breakdown by lab). 841
participants (54.26%) were women and 442 participants (28.52%) were men;
the remaining participants did not respond to the item, were asked about
gender in a non-standard way, or chose a different response. The mean
age was 19.91 years (SD = 2.49). Participant reported race was 946
(61.03%) White, 252 (16.26%) Asian, 112 (7.23%) Black or African
American, 4 (0.26%) American Indian or Alaska Native, 7 (0.45%) Native
Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, and 124 (8%) another category. The
remaining participants did not report their race or their responses
could not be recoded to match these categories. \<\<TABLE 1 OMITTED\>\>
\<\<TABLE 2 OMITTED\>\> Analysis Plan The primary finding of interest
from Greenberg et al. (1994) was that participants who underwent the
mortality salience treatment showed greater preference for the pro-US
essay author over the anti-US essay author as compared to the control
condition. To assess whether the replication results support the
original, within each lab we followed a similar analysis plan as in the
original article, as specified by our pre-registration
(https://osf.io/4xx6w). Scores from the three items evaluating the
authors of the anti-American essays were averaged (α = 0.89) and then
subtracted from the average of the three items evaluating authors of the
pro-American essays (α = 0.89). An independent-samples t-test was then
conducted comparing those in the mortality salient (MS) condition with
scores from the "TV salient" (control) condition. We then analyzed these
individual results meta-analytically to get an aggregate effect size
across all labs. Supplemental exploratory (non-preregistered) analyses
treating these as two separate dependent variables are available in the
online supplement (https://osf.io/xtg4u/), and those outcomes do not
qualify the conclusions offered here. In addition to the overall
exclusions detailed previously in the "Participants" section, original
authors requested some additional exclusions based on participant
responses. Original authors were not entirely in agreement about what
exclusions should be implemented. Therefore, as indicated in the
pre-registration, we repeated our analyses under three different
exclusion criteria: A minimal set of exclusions (Exclusion Set 1), and
two sets of more strict exclusions recommended by original authors
(Exclusion Sets 2 and 3). Because Exclusion Sets 2 and 3 were
specifically recommended by original authors and could be considered
part of their expertise, we did not inform the In House labs about these
exclusions prior to data collection. This masking was to avoid
influencing their decisions about data collection procedures, which had
to be made independently of any outside help. However, as a result, none
of the In House labs collected the data required to make these more
strict exclusions because the items required were not present in the
original target article. Therefore, analyses were repeated for each of
the three exclusion sets for Author Advised participants. However,
Exclusion Set 1 was used consistently across all analyses for In House
participants. The exclusion sets consisted of: Exclusion Set 1: Exclude
participants who did not complete both writing prompts and all six items
evaluating the essay authors. This yields 1,550 participants (n = 699
Author Advised, n = 851 In House). This aggregate sample size gives us
95% power to detect a mortality salience condition effect of d = 0.18 in
an independent samples t-test.4 \<\<TABLE 3 OMITTED\>\> Exclusion Set 2:
All prior exclusions, and further exclude participants who did not
identify as White or who indicated they were born outside the United
States. This reduces the N to 1,229 participants (n = 378 Author
Advised, n = 851 In House). This aggregate sample size gives us 95%
power to detect a mortality salience condition effect of d = 0.21.
Exclusion Set 3: All prior exclusions, and further exclude participants
who responded lower than 7 on the American Identity item ("How important
to you is your identity as an American?" 1 - not at all important; 9 -
extremely important). This further reduces the usable N to 1,076
participants (n = 225 Author Advised, n = 851 In House). This aggregate
sample size gives us 95% power to detect a mortality salience condition
effect of d = 0.22. All data handling, exclusions, and computation of
results within sites followed our pre-registered (prior to data
collection) analysis plan on the OSF (https://osf.io/4xx6w). All results
are reported with two-tailed tests of significance.5 Results Deviations
from Pre-registered Analytic Plan Our pre-registered analytic plan
specifies the use of a three-level meta-analysis, conducted in the
MetaSEM R package (Cheung, 2014), to control for the clustering of
effect sizes when independent teams ran both In House and Author Advised
versions of the protocol at the same university. However, during data
analysis we discovered that these models failed to optimize to a
solution (OpenMX status1 = 5) which means that their output cannot be
interpreted (see https://openmx.ssri.psu.edu/wiki/errors). This is
likely because we did not have enough data within each cluster, as
almost all sites ended up conducting only one study (e.g., administering
only the Author Advised or In House protocol, not both). As such, we had
to drop the clustering variable. The results reported below are thus a
more common univariate meta-analysis, which is the model that most
closely mirrors our originally planned analysis.

\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS CONTINUE\>\>

Research Question 1: [[Meta-analytic Results across **All**
Labs]{.underline}]{.mark} (Random Effects Meta-analysis).

The most basic question is whether we observed the predicted effect of
mortality salience on preference for pro- vs anti- American essay
authors. To assess this, we conducted a random-effects meta-analysis.
This analysis produces the grand mean effect size across all sites and
versions. [[Regardless of **which**]{.underline}]{.mark} exclusion
[**[criteria]{.mark}** were [used, we did **not** observe the]{.mark}
**predicted [effect]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and [the confidence interval
was **quite narrow**]{.underline}: Exclusion Set 1: Hedges' g = 0.07,
95% CI = \[-0.03, 0.17\], SE = 0.05, Z = 1.32, p = .187. Exclusion Set
2: Hedges' g = 0.09, 95% CI = \[-0.03, 0.21\], SE = 0.06, Z = 1.49, p =
.135. Exclusion Set 3: Hedges' g = 0.09, 95% CI = \[-0.04, 0.22\], SE =
0.07, Z = 1.30, p = .193. Forest plots showing the effects for
individual sites and the aggregate are available in Figures 1, 2, and 3
for Exclusion Sets 1, 2, and 3, respectively. These results indicate
that, [[in the **aggregate**, we **failed** to replicate]{.mark} the
predicted [mortality salience effect]{.mark}]{.underline}.

\<\<FIGURE 1 OMITTED\>\>

There may have been a mortality salience effect at some sites and not
others, so we next examined how much variation was observed among effect
sizes (e.g., heterogeneity). This sort of variation did not exceed
variation expected by chance (e.g., sampling variance) regardless of
exclusion rule: Exclusion Set 1: Q(16) = 19.35, p = .251; Exclusion Set
2: Q(16) = 21.72, p = .152; Exclusion Set 3: Q(16) = 18.57, p = .292.
This result suggests that any observed differences in effect size
between sites are likely due to random noise, as opposed to true
differences in effect size.

[**In sum**, we observed **little evidence** for an **overall effect**
of mortality salience in these replications]{.underline}. Additionally,
overall results suggest that there was little or no heterogeneity in
effect sizes across sites. This lack of variation suggests that it is
unlikely we will observe an effect of Author Advised versus In House
protocols or other moderators such as differences in samples or TMT
knowledge. Even so, the plausible moderation by Author Advised/In House
protocol is examined in the following section.

Research Question 2: Moderation by Author Advised/In House protocol

A covariate of protocol type (In House vs Author Advised) was added to
the random effects model to create a mixed-effects meta-analysis. This
is our primary model of interest, and the model most similar to the
three-level mixed-effects meta-analysis that we pre-registered as our
primary outcome.

This analysis again produces an **[[overall]{.mark} grand [mean
effect]{.mark} size]{.underline}**, and those
[[were]{.underline}]{.mark} again [**near [zero]{.mark}**
and]{.underline} relatively **[[precisely]{.mark}
estimated]{.underline}** across all three Exclusion Sets: Exclusion Set
1: Hedges' g = 0.07, 95% CI = \[-0.03, 0.17\], SE = 0.05, Z = 1.33, p =
.182. Exclusion Set 2: Hedges' g = 0.11, 95% CI = \[-0.02, 0.24\], SE =
0.07, Z = 1.71, p = .087. Exclusion Set 3: Hedges' g = 0.13, 95% CI =
\[-0.03, 0.29\], SE = 0.08, Z = 1.57, p = .117.

Anders and Ballard agreed with classical Realists that [[the advent
of]{.mark} [nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline} marked an
epochal change, and both argued that the atomic bomb [[**disrupted**
linear]{.mark} or progressive forms of
[temporality]{.mark}]{.underline}. With the bombing of Hiroshima, Anders
argued, the human species had entered a new and final stage of its
existence: 'On August 6, 1945, the Day of Hiroshima, a New Age began:
the age in which [at **any given moment** we have the power to
transform]{.underline} any given place on our planet, and even [our
planet itself]{.underline}, into a Hiroshima.'Footnote 72 Hiroshima now
signalled a 'worldwide condition' from which there was no escape,
neither spatially nor temporally. This is '"The Last Age"', he
concluded, 'for [there is **no possibility** that]{.underline} its
"differentia specifica", [the possibility of our
**self-extinction**]{.underline}, [can ever end]{.underline} -- [but by
the end itself]{.underline}.'Footnote 73 Ballard likewise referred to
the postwar period as the 'Pre-Third', a kind of protracted purgatory
where the meaning of human existence was graspable solely in terms of
what would come after: World War Three.

In fact, Ballard considered the idea of the future as anything else but
catastrophic deeply anachronous: 'Probably the first casualty of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki was the concept of the future. I think the future
died some time in the fifties. Maybe with the explosion of the hydrogen
bomb.'Footnote 74 To Ballard, [the death of the future also heralded the
death of the **American Dream** and the belief in a **better
tomorrow**]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} science-infused [dreams of
yesterday had **mutated** into today\'s]{.underline} technological
[nightmares]{.underline}. To Anders, too, [a catastrophic future
was]{.underline} 'already [throwing a **shadow** on the
present]{.underline}' **[[challenging]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
ubiquitous-but-unwarranted [[faith in]{.mark} **never-ending
[progress]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a belief that foreclosed any
conception of endings.Footnote 75 We go on, he lamented, under an
illusion of eternity.Footnote 76 In short, Anders and Ballard developed
new temporal categories to capture human existence as suspended in time,
a new condition in which previous distinctions -- between present and
future, peace and war, continuity and finality, utopianism and
conservatism -- had collapsed.

[Despite]{.underline} their rendition of postwar being as a
**[being-towards-extinction]{.underline}**,
[[neither]{.underline}]{.mark} Anders nor Ballard [**fully
[succumbed]{.mark}** [to **fatalism**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Although]{.underline} both towards the end of their lives grew
**[increasingly pessimistic]{.underline}** about the conditions for
transformation and individual freedom, their respective
[[framings]{.underline}]{.mark} of the future as the final stop on the

hypotheses and issuing warnings, insisted that his fiction was
'affirmative' and 'positive' rather than the work of 'a decadent,
celebrating the pleasures of the evening light'.Footnote 78 He was
adamant that his message should not be mixed up with the décor in which
it was delivered. While often set in bleak man-made landscapes, he
viewed his fiction as tales of psychic fulfillment, metamorphosis, and
transcendence. [[While]{.mark} Ballard was [**sceptical**
about]{.mark}]{.underline} sociopolitical [**[utopianism]{.mark}** and
the emancipatory potential [of]{.mark} science and

### 2AC\-\--Nuke War O/W

#### Preventing nuclear war is an [ethical obligation]{.underline} that [outweighs]{.underline} ontological questions.

**Bousquet, 24**---Associate Professor at the Swedish Defence University
(Antoine, "Nuclear existentialism: On the philosophical response to life
and death under the bomb," Review of International Studies, FirstView,
November 4, 2024, DOI: 10.1017/S0260210524000512, dml)

According to Levinas, the tradition of [[Western philosophy]{.mark} has
systematically [privileged **self** rather than
**other**]{.mark}]{.underline}, freedom over justice, and autonomy over
heteronomy. Underlying their proclaimed pursuit of truth, philosophers
have affirmed the fundamental 'freedom of the investigator' and through
it the prospect of 'the conquest of being by man over the course of
history'.Footnote 122 In so doing, [any encounter with radical otherness
that might alienate and restrict the autonomous subject is
**foreclosed**]{.underline} and systematically recast as yet another
iteration of the same. 'When, in the philosophical life that realises
this freedom, there arises a term foreign to the philosophical life,
other -- the land that supports us and disappoints our efforts, the sky
that elevates us and ignores us, the forces of nature that aid us and
kill us, things that encumber us or serve us, men who love us and
enslave us -- it becomes an obstacle; it has to be surmounted and
integrated into this life.'Footnote 123 From this perspective,
Heidegger's thought does not constitute the break with post-Socratic
philosophy it claims to be since it still upholds the tradition in which
'freedom, even the freedom that is identical with reason, precedes
justice'.Footnote 124 Levinas extends this charge to subsequent
existentialisms with a pointed barb directed at Sartre: 'existence is
not condemned to freedom, but judged and invested as a freedom'.Footnote
125 Modern political theories that have since Hobbes all made individual
freedom their central axiom also share in the same unquestioned
postulate. Furthermore, [[this]{.underline}]{.mark} philosophical
[disposition [harbours]{.mark}]{.underline} within it [an [**innate
potential for violence** through]{.mark} its inability truly to
recognise otherness and its corresponding [drive to
assimilate]{.mark}]{.underline}. In contrast, Levinas's radical
submission is that **[[ethics precedes ontology]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
whereby ethical consciousness constitutes 'the concrete form of a
movement more fundamental than freedom, but does not lead back to
violence'.Footnote 126 [[We are always face to face with a pre-existent
Other that]{.underline}]{.mark} cannot be integrated but instead [opens
up a **perpetual ethical questioning** and [foregrounds]{.mark} the
problem of **[justice]{.mark}**]{.underline} over freedom. Crucially,
[this turn to ethics does [not]{.mark} seek to ground itself in [any
**absolute**]{.mark} **transcendent [order]{.mark}** [of
values]{.mark}]{.underline}, the possible foundations of which have been
exploded by the dynamite of nihilism, [but]{.underline} rather [in the
inexhaustible]{.underline} phenomenology of the [face of the
other]{.underline}.Footnote 127

This Levinasian perspective further invites a re-evaluation of the
question of death and individual finitude so central to existentialist
concerns in Heidegger's wake. For [if our own death is
phenomenologically inaccessible to us]{.underline} (we can only approach
[it]{.underline} since its advent [necessarily happens in our
absence]{.underline}), it must be that [our knowledge and experience
comes in the **first instance** from the death of
**others**]{.underline}: '[we encounter death in the face of the
other]{.underline}'.Footnote 128 In this way, Levinas questions the
equation made between the individual's relationship to their own death
and death in general. In the final instance, this challenges the meaning
given to death as 'the end of being-in-the-world, as
annihilation'.Footnote 129 'Death is not identical to nothingness',
insists Levinas.Footnote 130 [[Rather than starting from the
**individual's confrontation** to finitude]{.mark} to make sense of
collective death]{.underline}, Levinas proposes instead to
[[ground]{.mark} our [understanding]{.mark} of death [in]{.mark} the
primary [experience of the **other's demise**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[This has]{.mark} the effect of installing [an **ethical horizon** at
the **outset**]{.mark}]{.underline} through an originary opening onto
otherness rather than a putative nothingness: 'the death signified by
the end could not measure the entire significance of death without
becoming responsibility for another -- by which one becomes oneself in
reality: [[one **becomes oneself** through this]{.underline}]{.mark}
untransferable, undelegatable [responsibility]{.underline}'.Footnote 131

Levinas also approaches fear in a distinctive fashion, once again
displacing the individual, solipsistic perspective typical of
existentialism. For ethical responsibility finds as a correlate a 'fear
for the other' occasioned by our very own 'being in the world',
conceived as the 'usurpation of places that belong to the other man who
has already been oppressed or starved by me'.Footnote 132 [If our
existential experience begins with the relationship to the
other]{.underline}, [it is]{.underline} accordingly [**not** the
**fear** of our own death that should guide our conduct but
**responsibility** for the death of the other]{.underline}, [be they
friend or enemy]{.underline}. [The [challenge of **nuclear death**
is]{.mark}]{.underline} thereupon **[[not]{.underline}]{.mark}**
foremost that of the individual's **[[fear]{.underline}]{.mark}** over
the meaninglessness [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} their **[[personal
demise]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the absence of posterity [[but]{.mark}
rather [the **boundless responsibility** that the prospect of **human
extinction** places]{.mark} on each of us]{.underline}.

### AT: Giroux

#### Giroux's pedagogy is stuck in theory---they can't generate change

**Tarlau, 14**---Visiting Scholar at the University of California,
Berkeley, Center for Latin American Studies and a Visiting Assistant
Professor of Educational Leadership and Societal Change at Soka
University of America (Rebecca, "From a Language to a Theory of
Resistance: Critical Pedagogy, the Limits of "Framing," and Social
Change", Educational Theory Volume 64, Issue 4, pages 369--392, August
2014, dml)

Nonetheless, [[while the **hope** is that critical pedagogy will]{.mark}
offer teachers tools to help [build a more equal society,
scholars]{.mark} of critical pedagogy often **[fail to]{.mark} make the
[connect]{.mark}ion** between **[radical]{.mark} educational
[practices]{.mark}** [and **concrete**]{.mark} **examples** of social
[change]{.mark}. The majority of]{.underline} critical pedagogy
[scholarship focuses on why]{.underline} public [schools reproduce the
same]{.underline} economic, social, and racial
[hierarchies]{.underline}.19 [**Giroux** is perhaps the best known for
his theories of resistance and education; however, [Giroux]{.mark}
discusses resistance **primarily through an analysis of critical
theory**. This approach often [**fails** to go from a **"language of
resistance"** to a **concrete analysis** of the ways]{.mark} in which
people using [alternative educational practices **form larger
movements**]{.mark} for change]{.underline}. Michael [Apple]{.underline}
[notes this disconnect]{.underline} in the critical pedagogy literature,
[calling for more "substantive large-scale discussion of feasible
alternatives to neoliberal]{.underline} and neoconservative visions,
policies, and [practices]{.underline}."20

#### This is [offense]{.underline}---[justifying]{.underline} their vagueness with 'but our impacts' [actively reproduces totalitarianism]{.underline}

**Bowker, 17**---Clinical Assistant Professor of Humanities at Medaille
College (Matthew, "Review: Henry A. Giroux, America at War with Itself,"
Logos, SPRING 2017: VOL 16, NOS. 1-2, dml)

In spite of the book's usefulness in cataloging the challenges before
us, however, what really seems "to connect" the tragedies Giroux
describes and the "dark clouds" from whence they are distilled is that
progressives are against them. While there are good reasons to be
"against them," [the adversary Giroux sets up]{.underline} in his book
[is **hydra-headed**, invested with an **almost demiurgic quality**, and
yet remains **so vague** as to **inspire confusion**]{.underline}. For
instance, while Giroux is surely correct that [the dangers we
face]{.underline} are not "new," they [are **most often** attributed
to]{.underline} that preferred whipping boy of contemporary progressives
and academics: ["**neoliberalism**." The concept of "neoliberalism" has
been **used** and **abused** to the point of
**meaninglessness**]{.underline}, serving now primarily to unite
Leftists under a common banner. [Giroux]{.underline}, himself, [holds
"neoliberalism" responsible for **plutocracy**, **militarization**,
**racism**, **xenophobia**, **sexism**]{.underline}, celebrity worship,
entertainment-culture, [the **degradation of public
education**]{.underline}, the erasure of historical memory, [the
**elimination of public spaces**, the **absence of solidarity** among
citizens, the **privatization of time**, and **more**]{.underline}.

And ["neoliberalism" is **not the only slippery signifier** relied upon
by Giroux. What is denounced as "**fascism**" on one page is decried as
"**authoritarianism**" on another, "**totalitarianism**" on another,
"**demagoguery**" on another, and "**tyranny**" on another]{.underline}.
In Chapter 3, entitled, "The Menace of Authoritarianism," there is even
a subsection entitled, "The Menace of Totalitarianism." Not only does
this relationship of sub- and super-ordinacy seem counter-intuitive, but
**[nowhere]{.underline}** in the book [can the reader find a description
of (Giroux's understanding of) the **relationship** between these
important concepts]{.underline}. Later, Giroux argues that
"totalitarianism throws together authoritarian and anti-democratic forms
that represent a new moment in American history." The claim that we are
facing a "new" moment in history not only seems to contradict Giroux's
central thesis that current events are "not new," but is exemplary of
the confusion we face if we take seriously ideas like totalitarianism,
authoritarianism, and democracy. [In calling attention to these
discrepancies, it is **not**]{.underline} my intention [to focus
**excessive attention** on **semantics**]{.underline}, to be petty, or
to trivialize the issues treated throughout the book. On the contrary,
[we **learn something vital** by **attending to Giroux's
language**]{.underline}.

While it is well beyond the scope of this brief review to offer
definitions and distinctions between concepts such as fascism,
authoritarianism, tyranny, and totalitarianism, they may be usefully
distinguished by the relative importance of charismatic leadership, the
influence of nativist or racist political dogma, the degree of
state-intrusion into private lives of citizens, the relative influence
(or lack thereof) of the rule of law, and several other identifiable
(although not always quantifiable) variables. [To **use such terms
interchangeably** suggests that Giroux's attempt to "**connect**" issues
and problems may **not be so much** an **intellectual endeavor** as an
**emotional one**. That is, the goal would seem to be to **affirm the
enemy**, in **all of its guises**, to **forge emotional
identifications** between readers and victims, and to form a sort of
loosely-knit group **defined by opposition** to the **overwhelming evil
objects** named and re-named]{.underline} throughout the book. Put
simply, [when terms and concepts like these are **muddled** in this way,
they serve **primarily** to **reassure us** that **we are in danger**,
that **we are together**, and that **we are on the right
side**]{.underline}.

For instance, while it certainly holds rhetorical appeal, Giroux's
decision to call the Flint, Michigan water crisis an act of "state
violence" and "domestic terrorism" seems intended to rouse us to anger
more than to help us understand the (potentially interesting)
connections between neoliberalism, the politics of austerity, racism,
and terrorism. If we wish the idea of terrorism to be at all meaningful
--- and almost any reasonable definition involves terrorism's symbolic
nature: its emphasis not on the infliction of injury but on spectacular
violence that engenders widespread fear and psychological distress ---
then naming the Flint crisis "terrorism" without further explanation
teaches us little about the Flint crisis and terrorism. To say it
another way, the "connection" Giroux strives to accomplish here is not a
connection based on understanding but on outrage and anger. If both
terrorism and poisoned water unite us in outrage in anger, then perhaps
we need not think about whether it is reasonable to suggest they are the
same. Or, if the goal of making this connection is, as I have suggested,
an emotional one, then perhaps we would rather not think about it.

[Giroux **does not reflect** on the irony that, in a book dedicated to
resisting "the unthinkable," antagonizing forces are **made
indecipherable** and, to that degree, "**unthinkable**."]{.underline}
This unacknowledged internal tension, however, does not necessarily
decrease the book's value, at least not if we can read Giroux "against
the grain," as Terry Eagleton would say. Indeed, such a reading is
illuminating, for it reveals that [even a brilliant mind, like Giroux's,
engaged in]{.underline} a noble pursuit, such as [formulating opposition
to totalitarianism, may **fall victim** to patterns of thinking and
emoting that are, themselves, **totalizing**]{.underline}. Perhaps the
most obvious example of this is that the very title of the book,
"America at War with Itself," turns out to be nothing but a slogan,
repeated eight or nine times, but not once examined or explored. It is
difficult not to remark the irony in the book's call to judgment when
the reader is asked to reflect on "the banality of evil" and on the
figure of Adolf Eichmann, whom Hannah Arendt famously condemned as a man
who could think only in slogans.

In Part 4, which contains a single chapter, we find [Giroux's proposed
solution]{.underline} to the overwhelming dangers we face. Giroux
exhorts [us to implement a "resurgent and insurrectional democracy,"
although this concept is **never defined**. If we take "resurgency" and
"insurrection" at **face value**, we are **left to wonder** whether
blending these practices with democratic values would **require the
destruction** of **existing civil** and **political institutions**, and
even whether the combination]{.underline} of democracy, resurgency, and
insurrection [could **uphold the basic tenets of
democracy**]{.underline}, such as political equality and the possibility
of collective deliberation. [But Giroux quickly returns to more familiar
ground, the need for a "**critical pedagogy**,]{.underline}" a complex
and controversial term popularized by Paolo Friere and Giroux, himself.

[By "critical pedagogy," Giroux means, among other things, the renewal
of an "ethical imagination," a concept that is **puzzling** but
**potentially rich**]{.underline}. What is surprising is that [the
complex but possibly illuminating relationships between the imagination,
criticality, and ethics are **not explored**]{.underline} here. Instead,
[the reader finds a description of a pedagogy that **seems quite
uncritical**. For Giroux, pedagogy must be defined as "a moral and
political exercise" in order to "'refresh the idea of justice going dead
in us all the time,'"]{.underline} as the poet Robert Hass would have
it. [Learning to be a "skilled citizen," according to this pedagogy,
means adhering to a **particular set** of **moral** and **political
values**, which include pluralistic democracy, socio-economic
egalitarianism, non-violence, and the importance of "service to a
greater collective good."]{.underline} And [while many of us would
likely applaud these ideals, the **imposition of specific moral values**
upon **any pedagogy** should prompt **serious questions** about what we
mean by terms like "**critical**," "**ethical**," and
"**imagination**."]{.underline}

[If a "critical" pedagogy means that students are instructed to
**identify with the oppressed**, to **hate oppressors**, and to
**dedicate themselves** to **particular forms** of **moral** and
**political activity** identified as "good" by their instructors, then
it **replicates**, at the **most fundamental level**, the **dynamics of
totalitarian education**. Even the notion that a pedagogy should
"provide the conditions for students to be engaged individuals and
social agents," **predetermines the meaning** of "the good" as social
"engagement" and "agency," **seemingly neglecting** other ethical and
democratic values, such as **autonomy**, **solitude**, and
**resistance** to the **imposition of any (group)
identity**.]{.underline}

[Related to the democratic and pedagogical renewal Giroux proposes is a
**long list** of needed]{.underline} intellectual, cultural, and global
["changes" which, while laudable, **lack definition** and
**explanation**. In addition to the renewal of "public spaces," Giroux
implores us to create "a **new language**," a "**new discourse**," new
"**global alliances**," a "**new form of politics**," a "**new political
conversation**," and "**new forms of agency**."]{.underline} We "need to
invent a new system from the ashes of one that is terminally broken,"
[we need an **entire "rethinking \[of\] the space of the political,"**
and we need always to "**connect issues**,"]{.underline} for "there has
never been a more pressing time to rethink the meaning of politics,
justice, struggle, collective action, and the development of new
political parties and social movements." [So, faced with the specter of
"the unthinkable," urged on by **indistinct** and **overwhelming "dark"
forces** with **too many names to count**, we must embrace the hope that
an **all-encompassing personal** and **political renewal** can be
accomplished by **enforcing a progressive pedagogy** focused on
**emotional identification** with **oppression**, **victimization**, and
**injustice**. Here, the language of resistance becomes **difficult to
differentiate** from the **language of totalitarianism**.]{.underline}

### AT: Numbing

#### No numbing or fatalism impacts.

**Macy 2k** (Joanna, adjunct professor at the California Institute of
Integral Studies, "Environmental Discourse and Practice: A Reader," pg.
243)

The move to a wider ecological sense of self is in large part a function
of the dangers that are threatening to overwhelm us. [[We are confronted
by]{.underline}]{.mark} social breakdown, [[wars]{.mark}, nuclear
prolif]{.underline}eration, [[and]{.mark} the]{.underline} progressive
[[destruction]{.mark} of our biosphere.]{.underline} Polls show that
people today are aware that the world, as they know it, may come to an
end. This loss of certainty that there will be a future is the pivotal
psychological reality of our time. Over the past twelve years my
colleagues and I have worked with tens of thousands of people in North
America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, helping them confront and explore
what they know and feel about what is happening to their world. **[[The
purpose]{.underline}]{.mark}** of this work, which was first known as
"Despair and Empowerment Work," **[[is to
overcome]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[numbing and
powerlessness]{.underline}]{.mark}** that result from suppression of
painful responses to massively painful realities.
[[As]{.underline}]{.mark} their grief and [[fear for the world
is]{.underline}]{.mark} allowed to be [[expressed]{.underline}]{.mark}
without apology or argument [[and validated as a]{.mark} wholesome,
[life-preserving response, people break through]{.mark} their avoidance
mechanisms]{.underline}, break through their sense of futility [and
[isolation]{.mark}.]{.underline} Generally what they break through
[[into]{.underline}]{.mark} is [[a larger sense of
identity]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is as if the pressure of their
acknowledged [awareness of]{.underline} the [suffering of our
world]{.underline} stretches or [collapses the culturally defined
boundaries of the self]{.underline}. It becomes clear, for example, that
the grief and **[[fear]{.underline}]{.mark}** experienced **[[for our
world]{.underline}]{.mark}** and our common future **[[are categorically
different from similar sentiments relating to]{.underline}]{.mark}**
one's **[[personal welfare]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This pain cannot be
equated with dread of one's own individual demise. Its source lies less
in concerns for personal survival than in apprehensions of collective
suffering -- of what looms for human life and other species and unborn
generations to come. Its nature is akin to the original meaning of
compassion -- "suffering with." It is [[the distress we feel on]{.mark}
behalf of [the larger whole]{.mark}]{.underline} of which we are a part.
And, when it is so defined, it [[serves as]{.mark} a
trigger]{.underline} or getaway [to [a more encompassing sense of
identity, inseparable from]{.mark} the web of [life]{.mark}]{.underline}
in which we are as intricately connected as cells in a larger body. This
shift in consciousness is an appropriate, adaptive response. For [[the
crisis that threatens our planet]{.underline}]{.mark}, be it seen [in
its military]{.underline}, ecological, or social [aspects, derives [from
a dysfunctional]{.mark}]{.underline} and pathogenic [[notion of the
self]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is a mistake about our place in the order
of things. It is the delusion that the self is so separate and fragile
that we must delineate and defend its boundaries, that it is so small
and needy that we must endlessly acquire and endlessly consume, that it
is so aloof that we can -- as individuals, corporations, nation-states,
or as a species -- be immune to what we do to other beings.

### AT: Quantifies Life

#### No quantification impacts.

**Fassin 10** - James D. Wolfensohn Professor in the School of Social
Science at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, as well as
directeur d'études at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales,
Paris. (Didier, Fall, "Ethics of Survival: A Democratic Approach to the
Politics of Life" Humanity: An International Journal of Human Rights,
Humanitarianism, and Development, Vol 1 No 1, Project Muse)

Conclusion [[Survival]{.underline}]{.mark}, in the sense Jacques Derrida
attributed to the concept in his last interview, not only shifts lines
that are too often hardened between biological and political lives: it
[**[opens]{.mark} an ethical [space for]{.mark}** **[reflection and
action]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Critical thinking in the past decade has
often taken biopolitics and the politics of life as its
objects]{.underline}. It has thus unveiled the way in which individuals
and groups, even entire nations, have been treated by powers, the
market, or the state, during the colonial period as well as in the
contemporary era. [However, through indiscriminate extension, this
powerful instrument has lost some of its analytical sharpness and
heuristic potentiality]{.underline}. On the one hand, [[the]{.mark}
binary [reduction of life to the opposition between]{.mark} nature and
history, [bare life and qualified life]{.mark}]{.underline}, when
systematically applied from philosophical inquiry in sociological or
anthropological study, [[erases]{.mark} much of [the]{.mark} complexity
and [richness of life]{.mark} in society as it is in fact
observed]{.underline}. On the other hand[, the normative prejudices
which underlie the evaluation of the forms of life and of the politics
of life, when generalized to an undifferentiated collection of social
facts, end up by depriving social agents of legitimacy, voice, and
action]{.underline}. The risk is therefore both scholarly and political.
It calls for ethical attention. In fact, the genealogy of this
intellectual lineage reminds us that the main founders of these theories
expressed tensions and hesitations in their work, which was often more
complex, if even sometimes more obscure, than in its reduced and
translated form in the humanities and social sciences today. And also
biographies, here limited to fragments from South African lives that I
have described and analyzed in more detail [elsewhere, suggest the
necessity of complicating the dualistic models that oppose biological
and political lives. Certainly, [powers like the]{.mark} market and the
[state]{.mark} do [act sometimes as if human beings could be reduced to
"mere life," but]{.mark} democratic [forces]{.mark}, including from
within the structure of power, [tend to produce alternative]{.mark}
[strategies that escape this reduction]{.mark}]{.underline}. [And
[people themselves, even under conditions of
domination]{.mark},]{.underline} \[End Page 93\] [[manage subtle tactics
that transform their]{.mark} physical [life]{.mark} [into a]{.mark}
political instrument or a [moral resource]{.mark} or an affective
expression]{.underline}. But let us go one step further: ethnography
invites us to reconsider what life is or rather what human beings make
of their lives, and reciprocally how their lives permanently question
what it is to be human. "The blurring between what is human and what is
not human shades into the blurring over what is life and what is not
life," writes Veena Das. In the tracks of Wittgenstein and Cavell, she
underscores that the usual manner in which we think of forms of life
"not only obscures the mutual absorption of the natural and the social
but also emphasizes form at the expense of life."^22^ It should be the
incessant effort of social scientists to return to this inquiry about
life in its multiple forms but also in its everyday expression of the
human.
