#### Increased NATO presence in the Artic is [destabilizing]{.underline}, it causes Russian lash out. Only the status quo solves 

Alex **Little 24**, writer at NATO watch, 05/04/2024, "What will NATO do
with its giant Arctic footprint?"
<https://natowatch.org/default/2024/what-will-nato-do-its-giant-arctic-footprint>,
eb

The [[Arctic]{.mark} served as a [frontline]{.mark} in the
[confrontation]{.mark} between **NATO**]{.underline} and the **[Soviet
Union]{.underline}** during the [Cold War]{.underline}. Over several
decades, [[Russia]{.mark} has [revitalized]{.mark} **Soviet-era Arctic**
[bases]{.mark}, which [**outnumber** **NATO's**]{.mark} by about a
third]{.underline}. In recent years, [Russia has launched significant
investment projects and built up its **military presence**]{.underline}
in the [**Arctic** as it develops a crucial northern maritime route
linking **Asia** and **Europe**]{.underline}. The United States only has
one operational heavy icebreaker --- compared to the 40 that Russia
currently maintains.

[Irrespective of **[hawks]{.mark}** [sounding]{.mark} the [alarm about
Russia's]{.mark} **supposed** "**[militarization]{.mark}**" and
"**dominance**" of the Arctic]{.underline}, Russia retains a relative
incapacity to threaten a conventional military land incursion into
European Arctic territory. [**[Moscow's]{.mark}** military
[efforts]{.mark} in the Arctic have been [mainly **defensive**]{.mark}
in nature as it has established **multi-layered anti-access**,
area-denial (**A2/AD**) capabilities around the **Kola
Peninsula**]{.underline}, a fundamental Russian interest.

[Such [**developments** pose **little threat**]{.mark} to the
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [and]{.mark} its
**[NATO]{.mark}** allies]{.underline}, especially as Russia is bogged
down in Ukraine.

Moreover, given that Russia's Arctic coastline is ten times longer than
America's, the "[icebreaker gap]{.underline}" is [to be
**expected**]{.underline}. [[Russia's]{.mark} fleet of
**[icebreakers]{.mark}** is primarily [dedicated]{.mark} to [escorting
commercial shipping]{.mark} through dangerous polar seas]{.underline}.
Otherwise, it performs the same missions as the U.S. Coast Guard:
"search and rescue, anti-smuggling, oil spill response, and resupply of
remote coastal communities and polar research stations."

Regarding force projection capabilities, the American-dominated NATO
nuclear submarine fleet outmatches the opposing Northern Fleet of the
Russian navy.

On top of NATO's military capabilities, the alliance's most influential
member, the [United States, has [placed **little** **military
importance**]{.mark} on the Arctic]{.underline}. [**[Russia's
inability]{.mark}** to pose severe threats in the **Arctic** has led to
the region appearing at the **bottom of the list** in the 2022
Biden-Harris National Security Strategy (**NSS**]{.underline}) overview
of regional policies. In addition, the document lacks any language
regarding deterring threats to Arctic allies and partners.

Rather than seeing the addition of Finland and Sweden as an opportunity
to increase the militarization of the Arctic, [**[NATO]{.mark}** should
[work toward]{.mark} **utilizing [working groups]{.mark}** like the
[**Arctic Council** to forge multilateral arrangements]{.mark} to
**[reduce tensions]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[[avoid
crises]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and [mitigate the risks of conflict
through an **accident** or **miscalculation**.]{.underline}

In February, [Russia suspended **annual payments** to the **Arctic
Council** until \"real work resumes with the participation of all
**member countries**]{.underline}." Yet, while Russia removed several
listed multilateral formats from its official Arctic strategy, it [kept
the point of "the Arctic Council as the key **regional
platform**]{.underline} coordinating **[international
activities]{.underline}** in the region." Thus, [Russia doesn't appear
poised to form an **alternative platform**]{.underline}.

Tensions are high, and Arctic Council cooperation with Moscow
effectively ceased after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Despite this,
the Council should refrain from pushing out the largest Arctic player
and severing an essential communication channel. Deepening isolation has
pushed Russia to look east for partners in the Arctic, namely China.
Further ostracization will only incentivize Russia to coordinate more
with Beijing in the region.

[[**Russia** and **NATO** share]{.mark} an [interest]{.mark} in
**[maintaining peace]{.mark}** in the **[Arctic
region]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A war in such terrain would be
[**[extremely costly]{.mark}** and **difficult** for both
sides]{.underline}. Furthermore, the Arctic Council has facilitated the
improvement of marine safety in the Bering Strait, where the U.S. and
Russia share a maritime border. Communication channels and shared
objectives must also be kept open to keep the peace there.

Amid a worsening situation in Ukraine, [**[escalation]{.mark}** in the
Arctic region would [do no favors for the United States or its **NATO
allies**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Russia's **[considerable]{.mark}
[influence]{.mark}** in the Arctic is [not going to change]{.mark} in
the near future]{.underline}. Therefore, [[taking advantage]{.mark} of
[existing channels]{.mark} will [enable]{.mark} the [West to
**signal**]{.mark} to Russia that [NATO **does not**]{.mark} intend to
[engage]{.mark} in **[offensive operations]{.mark}** but is **fully
prepared** to **defend** its **interests**.]{.underline}

#### NATO activities in the Arctic is [limited]{.underline} and [reserved]{.underline}. The plan disrupts that [balance]{.underline}.

https://doi. org/10.31374/sjms.375

Conclusions on Western Military in the European Arctic

The [[forces]{.mark} of the **northern [NATO allies]{.mark}** are
[relatively **small**]{.mark}]{.underline}, while Western military
activity in the European Arctic -- which [usually takes the [form of
**shorter exercises**]{.mark}, **[manoeuvres]{.mark}** and
**[flights]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- is [limited compared with many
**other regions**]{.underline}. Nevertheless, [such activity did begin
**increasing around 2018--19,**]{.underline} when [the first naval
manoeuvres and deployment of the BTF to the **European Arctic** took
place, as well as the large Trident Juncture exercise.]{.underline}

Moreover, the United States and Britain in particular have increased
their sea and air presence in the High North since 2019--20. The level
of naval activity seemingly increased again after 2022, with frequent
operations and exercises conducted by UK, U.S., Dutch, French and other
allied forces. This has normalized the Western/NATO presence in the
north, despite the absence of any permanently stationed allies in the
European Arctic -- a strong signal of commitment.

Although [**[uncertainties]{.mark}** surround the level of subsurface
activity]{.underline} (not every Western submarine necessarily docks in
or visits Norway or Iceland), it does seem to have increased
significantly since 2020. There is little doubt that the NATO allies are
greatly interested in the new Russian Yasen and Borey class submarines,
and are using air assets such as the P-8 Maritime Patrol Aircraft, as
well as subsurface assets, to track and monitor them.

Nonetheless, the [[number of allied naval operations]{.mark} in the
**Barents Sea** [remains **limited**]{.mark},]{.underline} with most
activity taking place in the Norwegian Sea and Fennoscandian airspace.
Norway deliberately conducts its NATO-associated exercises at a
significant distance -- about 500 km -- from the Russian border, and has
imposed limitations on allied activity near the Russian border in the
county of Finnmark. Similarly, allied air activity east of the meridian
24° East must be approved, and there is a ban on fighter jets east of
28° East, which is about 100 km from the Russian border (Friis, 2024).
[In [acknowledgment]{.mark} of the **Russian [nuclear arsenal]{.mark}**
in the region, these [measures]{.mark} have been [taken to avoid]{.mark}
any **[misunderstandings]{.mark}** that might [lead to **unwanted
escalation**]{.mark}. In this respect, the [**signalling** is
**calibrated** or **restrained**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Dynamics of US Grand Strategy in the Arctic\", Arctic Institute - Center

Security

In his 1987 Murmansk speech, [Mikhail Gorbachev described the
[Arctic]{.mark} as a "[**peace** and **cooperation**]{.mark}
zone]{.underline}," emphasizing collaboration over competition.29)
However during the 2000s, in response to an [**[increased
perception]{.mark}** of [**NATO's** Arctic presence]{.mark}]{.underline}
and strategic importance, [Russia began [**militarizing** the
**region**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [seeking to [reclaim]{.mark} its
[superpower]{.mark} status after the **Soviet Union's
collapse**]{.underline}.30) By 2019, Russia had [established 14
airfields, **six military bases**, refurbished **16 Soviet-era
deep-water ports**]{.underline}, and **[10 border posts]{.underline}**
in the Arctic, with its Northern Fleet boasting an estimated **[120
ships]{.underline}**, including **[40 icebreakers]{.underline}**.31)
Russia allowed PRC to construct docks at five of the most significant
ports along Russia's Arctic coastline.32) In contrast, the US needs to
develop a centralized command structure in the Arctic, a crucial aspect
of its security policy.33) It has only one significant base at Pituffik
Space Base in Greenland, with two additional bases south of the Arctic
Circle in Alaska.34) The US has only two ocean-going icebreakers. There
is a stark disparity in military presence between Russia and the US, a
potential security dilemma. Russia's action, and the US's inaction,
underscore the Arctic's strategic importance and the urgency for a
comprehensive security strategy.

[[Russia has **fortified**]{.mark} the **[region]{.mark}** to
**[protect]{.mark} future** **[strategic]{.mark}** and **[economic
interests]{.mark}**]{.underline}.35) The [US has interpreted this as an
attempt to achieve regional dominance, prompting **numerous military
operations**]{.underline} in the area.36) [[Moscow views **US**]{.mark}
**actions** as **[aggressive]{.mark}**]{.underline} intrusions into
[Russian territory, which has led to **[further
militarization]{.mark}**]{.underline} on both sides.37)

This ongoing dynamic was exemplified when US Vice Admiral Lewis claimed
that his fleet was prepared to secure sea lanes in the Atlantic and
Arctic.38) A Russian Duma member responded by stating that the US should
not tempt fate and that the NSR and Arctic were Russia's responsibility
where Russian national interests are present.39) The current
**[[US]{.mark} Grand Strategy]{.underline}** has acted firmly but
[[lacks]{.mark} consistent [messaging]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example,
in 2019, Secretary of State Pompeo decried Russian aggression in the
Arctic, citing their regulations on NSR shipping, Arctic fortification,
and actions in Ukraine.40) However, Pompeo's message lacked specificity
about why the US felt threatened, simply stating that the US would host
military exercises and increase its presence in the Arctic.41) [The US
[must ensure]{.mark} that its actions in the Arctic are firm,
**predictable**, [**consistent**, and **straightforward**]{.mark} to
[avoid]{.mark} **further [escalating tensions]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

#### NATO expansion in the Arctic is conflict [driving]{.underline} ensuring internal contradictions and a [militarized Arctic]{.underline}.

University of Connecticut and Senior Fellow, 7-16-2025, \"Why NATO's
Arctic Expansion Is Now Backfiring\" ,
https://politicsrights.com/why-natos-arctic-expansion-is-now-backfiring/

A Sudden Pivot: [[U.S.--Russia]{.mark} Rapprochement and **[NATO's
Fracture]{.mark}**]{.underline}

At the same time, the [**White House** has quickly sought to **mend
fences**]{.underline} with [[Russia]{.mark} and to [restore a more
collaborative]{.mark} and mutually respectful relationship, and such a
rapprochement promises to [restore **East-West
stability**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
**[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** as well as worldwide, with [[new
opportunities]{.mark} for a [restoration]{.mark} of [US-Russia **Arctic
cooperation**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Washington's [pivot toward
Moscow in many ways turns **upside down** the **dynamic**]{.underline}
that has been underway in the [Arctic since Russia invaded Ukraine in
2022, and **[America's rapprochement]{.mark}** with
**[Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline} is [[not]{.mark} universally
[embraced]{.mark} by the [other]{.mark} **democratic [Arctic]{.mark}
[states]{.mark}**]{.underline}, who continue to worry about Russia and
fear the US may next undermine their security interests, much the same
way it is now doing to Ukraine.

In the months ahead, with [[NATO]{.mark} in crisis and the **Arctic
Council's democratic members** -- so recently united]{.underline} --
[now on [separate sides]{.mark} of an [intra-alliance conflict,]{.mark}
there is much to be [**concerned** about in the
**Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline}. But the [restoration of a **positive
diplomatic**]{.underline} relationship between the United States and
Russia does help to [defuse one of the most pressing **security
risks**]{.underline} facing the Arctic in recent years, that of
[[continued Russian aggression]{.mark} against the West, which the White
House may be better [positioned to **dissuade**]{.mark} with **Moscow**
[now]{.mark} in **[greater alignment]{.mark}** with
**Washington**.]{.underline}

Whether this will reassure [Finland and Sweden]{.underline}, which had
both turned to the West for their collective defense, only to see NATO
itself stumble into what could prove to be an existential crisis, may
soon make them [long for their days of **neutrality**]{.underline},
[when they did not **depend** **entirely** upon the **United States** or
its NATO partners for their **survival**.]{.underline}

Why NATO's [[Arctic Expansion]{.mark} Is Now
**[Backfiring]{.mark}**]{.underline}

What [began as a [show of unity]{.mark} against Russian aggression is
[now revealing]{.mark} its **[internal
contradictions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [NATO's **[northern
enlargement]{.mark}**]{.underline}, once framed as a stabilizing move,
has [[fractured]{.mark} the very [alliances]{.mark} it [sought]{.mark}
to **[strengthen]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[splitting **indigenous
organizations**]{.underline}, [[paralyzing]{.mark} **[Arctic
diplomacy]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and [[provoking]{.underline}
**[intra-alliance tensions]{.underline}**]{.mark} [from **Greenland** to
the **Baltic**.]{.underline}

Instead of reinforcing cooperation, the [**[expansion]{.mark}** has
**[accelerated militarization]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[revived **Cold
War divisions**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [[undermined]{.mark} the
[multilateral ethos]{.mark} that once [defined **Arctic
governance**]{.mark}]{.underline}. By [[isolating Russia]{.mark}
entirely and [overextending]{.mark} its own **[strategic
coherence]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [NATO may have weakened its ability to
manage the region it is now **obligated** to defend.]{.underline}

#### Isolating Russia triggers [lash out]{.underline} and [militarization]{.underline}. 

Kari **Roberts 24**, writer at the Arctic Institute, 11/19/2024, \"Past
Need Not Be Prologue: Applying the Lessons of History to NATO-Russia
Relations in the Arctic\",
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/past-need-not-prologue-applying-lessons-history-nato-russia-relations-arctic/

The [[more isolated Russia feels]{.mark}, the [more likely]{.mark} they
are to [perceive **Western actions**]{.mark} as aggressive, and the more
likely]{.underline} they are to [favor intensified partnership with
**China**]{.underline}. It is worth remembering that [Russia is [less
**reviled**]{.mark} in the rest of the world]{.underline} [as it is in
the **West**]{.underline}. Even in the wake of its brutal and unprovoked
invasion of Ukraine, [some nations [continue]{.mark} to [resist
**sanctioning Russia**]{.mark} because they [perceive]{.mark} this as an
[element of **American efforts**]{.mark}]{.underline} to extend its
global dominance under the guise of sovereignty and human rights. [There
is [some **resentment**]{.mark} over the **[expectation]{.mark}** that
[other nations]{.mark} should [bear]{.mark} the [cost]{.mark} of
[**economic sanctions** against **Russia**]{.mark} that **primarily
[benefit]{.mark}** [Western agendas]{.mark}.]{.underline} Putin presents
Russia as an alternative partner, one that advocates for conservative
values and the preservation of established authoritarian regimes.20)
[There is an **appetite** for this narrative]{.underline}.

Angela Stent argued, prior to the Ukraine invasion, that "[[isolating
**Russia**]{.mark} and **refusing to deal with it**, [however
appealing]{.mark} that may be to some, is [not an
option]{.mark}]{.underline}," and that [**[realistic
engagement]{.mark}** in areas of [**mutual interest**]{.mark} is the
[best path forward]{.mark}]{.underline}.21) The
**[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** may [[present
**opportunities**]{.mark} for this]{.underline}, as there are so many
mutual interests at play, many of which continue to be recognized in
Russia's Arctic planning and policy documents.22) [[Both **prioritizing
national security**]{.mark}, **scientific-technological
[leadership]{.mark}**, and **balancing national interests** with
preserving the region]{.underline} as a zone of peace. Russia has
signaled a desire to capture 20 percent of the global LNG market by
2035, and a peaceful Arctic is the easiest path to this goal.

It is [[extremely unlikely]{.mark} that [Russia]{.mark} will ever
[match]{.mark} the [power]{.mark} of the **[USSR]{.mark}**]{.underline},
or realize its dream of parity with the US, but it is the
[[perception]{.mark} that the [US purposefully]{.mark} [threatens this
goal]{.mark} that [contributes]{.mark} to **[Russian
perceptions]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the [[West as
**aggressive**]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, [President Joe
Biden's]{.underline} 2022 **[comments]{.underline}** about [wanting to
unseat Putin and see regime change in Russia [fuel]{.mark} a [ferocious
**anti-American sentiment**]{.mark}]{.underline} in Russia that gives
political cover and even justification for Putin's extremism. To be very
clear, the West is not responsible for Putin's actions, but it is
important to understand that this rhetoric is powerful and impactful.
[[American power underwrites **NATO**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and so the
[[disruption]{.mark} of the [Alliance]{.mark} has become a **[top
priority]{.mark}**]{.underline} for the Kremlin. The [[more Russia
feels]{.mark} [pressured]{.mark} to [accept]{.mark} a **[rules-based
order]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}that is antithetical to Russian
interests and that imposes itself on Russia,23) [the [more
likely]{.mark} it is to [react **aggressively**]{.mark}.]{.underline} It
may be difficult to correct course in Ukraine in the short term, but it
may not be too late in the Arctic.

#### Increased NATO operations results in increased Russia military [responses]{.underline}. Their unpredictability makes them a unique threat to [Arctic]{.underline} [stability]{.underline}. Prefer actual intelligence [services]{.underline}. 

Olav **Knutsen 24**, Chief Researcher at the Norwegian Defence Research
Establishment, 01/30/2024, "War in Europe, but Still Low Tension in the
High North? An Analysis of Norwegian Mitigation Strategies", *Arctic
Review on Law and Politics*, vol (15), pp. 25--46,
<https://arcticreview.no/index.php/arctic/article/view/5065/9614>, eb

The [key question is whether Russia is a **status quo**]{.underline}
state in the [High North]{.underline}. To answer such a question, we
must once more turn to the latest [[assessments]{.mark} of the
**[Norwegian]{.mark} [intelligence]{.mark} service**]{.underline}. The
picture they [portray of [**Russia** is **mixed**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The report states clearly that the [Arctic has become a [stage]{.mark}
for great power [rivalry]{.mark}]{.underline} with a need for [Russia to
[consolidate]{.mark} its **[security interests]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
the Arctic: "[This could lead **[Russia]{.mark}** to [mark its **red
lines**]{.mark} and [react]{.mark} more **[vehemently]{.mark}** in the
face of **[perceived threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}. If push comes to
shove, Russia could abandon its low-tension policy."38 This might
indicate a development where the offense has the advantage. This is
further supported by what the intelligence service claims is greater
attention by Russia towards Norwegian ocean areas, territory, and
infrastructure. At the same time, [[Russia]{.mark} has become a more
**[unpredictable neighbour]{.mark}**]{.underline} where Norway is
perceived to be part of a "Western collective and less as a neighbouring
country with whom Russia has common interests."39 On the other hand, the
[**intelligence service** claims that so far, "there are **[no
changes]{.mark}** in the [**Russian** response]{.mark} to **[allied
activities]{.mark}** in the High North," even though the [security
situation]{.mark} is such that **[NATO operations]{.mark}** in the
**[High North]{.mark}** will be [met]{.mark} by **[Russian military
activity]{.mark}**.40]{.underline}

### Link\-\--Arctic Command\-\--2NC

#### Establishing an [Arctic Command]{.underline} undermines [cooperation]{.underline} and unnecessarily increases [military tension]{.underline}. 

Mathieu **Boulègue 21**, Global Fellow, Duncan **Depledge**, Lecturer in
Geopolitics and Security, Loughborough University, 04/16/2021, "It Is
Time to Negotiate a New Military Security Architecture for the Arctic"
https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/no-5-it-time-negotiate-new-military-security-architecture-arctic#:\~:text=The%20problem%20is%20that%20NATO,de%20facto%20control%20to%20Russia.

In order to [[address]{.mark} **[military]{.mark} security
[issues]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the [[knee-jerk reaction]{.mark} is to
[call]{.mark} on **[NATO]{.mark}** to push for **dialogue**]{.underline}
with [Russia on Arctic **military affairs**]{.underline}, whilst
[[guaranteeing]{.mark} the [security]{.mark} of allies [through
**deterrence**]{.mark}]{.underline}. NATO's [attention is indeed moving
**North**]{.underline}. For instance, the recent NATO 2030 report calls
for increased "situational awareness across the High North and the
Arctic" as well as for the creation of a proper Arctic strategy.

The problem is that [[NATO]{.mark} is [not]{.mark} the [ideal]{.mark}
place to [discuss **military security affairs**]{.mark}]{.underline} in
the Arctic. Russia has [[**refused** to **entertain**]{.mark} the
[idea]{.mark}]{.underline}, whilst Canada, Denmark and Norway have all
[[expressed caution]{.mark} about [asking **NATO**]{.mark} to
[lead]{.mark} the **[response]{.mark}**]{.underline} to
**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Antagonizing]{.mark}
[Russia]{.mark} [**unnecessarily goes against** the idea of a '**low
tension'**]{.mark} Arctic.]{.underline}

Recent expert opinion goes against this [**logic and [could lead to a
dangerous path]{.mark}**: th]{.underline}at for [[instance
**NATO**]{.mark} should [take]{.mark} the [lead]{.mark} in **[military
security affairs]{.mark}**, [create]{.mark} a Standing **NATO Maritime
Group for the Arctic**, or establish a full-fledged **[Arctic
Command]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

This is not the right approach. Although we agree that NATO must be
present in the Arctic, we advise two things. First, the Alliance
collectively needs to answer the question 'how much NATO do we want?' in
the European High North. Innovative efforts can be made to strengthen
military security and domain awareness in the region, [without
[putting]{.mark} [NATO]{.mark} at the [forefront]{.mark} of the
[response]{.mark} to **[Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is vital that
NATO maintains a flexible and normalized routine presence in the Arctic
so as not to cede de facto control to Russia.

Second, it is [[paramount]{.mark} to [clearly **differentiate**]{.mark}
between **[Alliance]{.mark}** contributions [as an
**institution**]{.mark} and **national** or **joint endeavors** of
**member states** [and]{.mark} other [partners to **Arctic
security**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Whether [bilaterally or in coalitions,
smaller groupings within **NATO already exist**]{.underline}, such as
the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) and the Northern Group.

#### An Arctic Command center is uniquely [destabilizing]{.underline}. Bilateral Cooperation solves the [case]{.underline} and avoids [fracturing]{.underline} the [Alliance]{.underline}. 

David **Auerswald 20**, Assistant Professor of Political Science and
International Affairs, George Washington University, 10-12-2020, \"NATO
in the Arctic: Keep Its Role Limited, For Now\", War on the Rocks,
https://warontherocks.com/2020/10/nato-in-the-arctic-keep-its-role-limited-for-now/

[[NATO]{.mark} itself should play a [very
**limited**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [direct [role]{.mark} in the
**Arctic**]{.underline}. The [alliance should only engage in
**circumscribed** contingency **planning** and **conduct**]{.underline}
the occasional large exercise like Trident Juncture in 2018. To do more
[[risks]{.mark} **[weakening]{.mark} alliance [unity]{.mark}** and
[**needlessly antagonizing** **Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Specifically, [NATO should [avoid]{.mark} [creating]{.mark} a **new
[alliance command]{.mark}** [dedicated]{.mark} to the
**[Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}, pushing for Sweden and Finland to join
the alliance, or [[establishing]{.mark} a new **[Arctic
security]{.mark}**]{.underline} forum between NATO and Russia. These
policy options have been floated in expert dialogues and ought to be
tabled, at least for now. Rather than coordinating through NATO, which
would continue today's policy, [[member states]{.mark} and their
non-NATO partners should [meet **Arctic** security threats]{.mark} by
[engaging]{.mark} in [more **frequent**]{.mark} and **deeper
unilateral**, **[bilateral]{.mark}**, or
**[coalition]{.mark}**-of-the-willing **[defense cooperation]{.mark}**
focused on cold weather training, regular military exercises, and
rotational force deployments]{.underline}. This is a **[subtle but
[important distinction]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Some physical activities
would look the same in this alternative policy, but they [would [not be
under]{.mark} a **[NATO moniker]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Context and Threats

Climate change is transforming the geopolitics of the Arctic. The Arctic
is warming two to three times as fast as the rest of the globe, with
corresponding ice-melt, softening of permafrost, higher waves and
erosion, and more frequent wildfire events. That translates into the
potential for more access to the Arctic, resource extraction, and
maritime activity, but also more threats to the human security of Arctic
populations, some of whom live in NATO countries.

America's rivals are taking an increased interest in Arctic issues.
[Russia --- long an Arctic power --- has renewed, expanded, and
developed **new military facilities**]{.underline} [across its **Arctic
territory**]{.underline}, mainly but not [exclusively centered on the
**Northern Sea Route**]{.underline}. Moreover, the [Russian navy has
conducted exercises]{.underline} in the Baltic, Barents, and Norwegian
Seas, while ground exercises simulate battle between Arctic states.
Commercial fishing vessels are moving farther north in pursuit of
previously unavailable fish stocks, threatening the livelihood of
coastal communities. Three of the eight Arctic states --- Finland,
Russia, and Sweden --- are not NATO members and Russia, at least, has
strong reasons to object to a greater NATO role in the region. Finally,
Moscow will take the two-year rotating chair of the Arctic Council and
the Arctic Coast Guard Forum in May 2021. China's regional actions
include increased scientific, diplomatic, and maritime activities, as
well as significant investment in the region. All these trends are
outside NATO's control but could affect NATO member perceptions and
behavior.

While NATO members are facing several challenges to their interests in
the Arctic, [[developing]{.mark} a **[common policy]{.mark}** within the
**[alliance]{.mark}** on what to do about this is **[incredibly
difficult]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**
decisions [[depend on consensus]{.mark}, or at least on members
[withholding]{.mark} a **[veto]{.mark}** of a **pending
initiative**.]{.underline} Just because there are five NATO members in
the Arctic does not mean that each supports a greater NATO role in the
Arctic. [[Canada's]{.mark} Arctic and Northern Policy Framework, for
instance, repeatedly emphasizes "Canada's [enduring **Arctic
sovereignty**]{.mark}]{.underline}," and the need to "[[enhance]{.mark}
**Canada's [military presence]{.mark}**]{.underline}" and "Canada's
**[[domain awareness]{.underline}]{.mark}**" (emphasis added), with
[some [references]{.mark} to **[bilateral security cooperation]{.mark}**
but no mention of **NATO**]{.underline}.
**[[Canada]{.underline}]{.mark}** is not the only country that might
[[object]{.mark} to a **stronger [alliance]{.mark}** role in the
Arctic]{.underline}. Alliance members in [[Southern]{.mark} and [Eastern
Europe]{.mark} might see an [increased]{.mark} Arctic [focus]{.mark} as
[syphoning]{.mark} [away]{.mark} **[NATO
resources]{.mark}**]{.underline} from [security challenges [in]{.mark}
the **eastern [Mediterranean]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the
**[Balkans]{.underline}**, **[Ukraine]{.underline}**, or the **[Baltic
Sea]{.underline}**. In short, a greater alliance role in the Arctic
requires convincing skeptical allies, and doing that might not be worth
the diplomatic effort.

[None of the above]{.underline}, with the possible exception of Russian
militarization along the Northern Sea Route, [constitutes a military
threat to **NATO**. That]{.underline} said, three military-security
threats merit discussion: Russian forces in the Arctic could threaten
European NATO members or threaten North America, and China's scientific
activities in the Arctic could lay the groundwork for future military
activities.

#### Expanded NATO in the Arctic drives fear of encirclement making crisis [more likely]{.underline}. 

Mathieu **Boulègue 24**, Global Fellow, 10/31/2024, "Russia\'s Arctic
Military Posture in the Context of the War against Ukraine"
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/russias-arctic-military-posture-context-war-against-ukraine/

On the one hand, [[Russia's]{.mark} self-inflicted [fear]{.mark} of
'**[encirclement]{.mark}'1**]{.underline}) by the [Atlantic Alliance has
been [validated]{.mark} by [**Finland** and
**Sweden**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[joining **NATO**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The double accession represents a fait accompli for the Kremlin, honed
by a self[-reinforcing propagandistic narrative that the
**[Alliance]{.mark}**]{.underline} is [[turning]{.mark} the
**[Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline} into a '[conflict zone'2) or that there
is a 'new **[Cold War]{.mark}'3**) in the region because of Western
policy.]{.underline}

This narrative is compounded by the recent release of the US National
Strategy for the Arctic Region (NSAR) in 2022 and the US Department of
Defense Arctic Strategy in 2024, which are also denounced as 'deciding
the region's future by force'4) or 'inviting confrontation'5) in the
Arctic.

Finland and Sweden [joining the Alliance further [fuels]{.mark} the
[Russian logic]{.mark} that the [non-Russian Arctic]{.mark} has [become
'**NATO territory'**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This ends up creating a 'NATO
7 vs. Russia'6) approach, which tends to [**[securitize]{.mark}** Arctic
[affairs]{.mark} and shape discussions [increasingly]{.mark} in
**[military terms]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [[policy
consequences]{.mark} are that Moscow is [planning]{.mark} more than ever
for all **contingencies**, [including **open military**]{.mark}
confrontation in the Arctic.]{.underline}

On the other hand, from a [[previous perception]{.mark} of relative
**[regional strength]{.mark}** and **[assertive]{.mark} force
[posture]{.mark}**, the impact of the war has [led **Moscow**]{.mark} to
[feel **vulnerable**]{.mark} in the Arctic. This [vulnerability]{.mark}
is [strategic]{.mark} (with the [perceived '**expansion'** of
**NATO**]{.mark}]{.underline}) and military, especially with regards to
the impact of climate change and receding sea ice across the AZRF.

The [Russian leadership [fears]{.mark} that a [more accessible]{.mark}
Arctic will [bring along]{.mark} more [**military activity** from
**NATO**]{.mark}]{.underline} and its allies in the European Arctic and
above North Pole approaches. [It also [fears]{.mark} there will be [more
**military presence**]{.mark} from the US and Canada in the Pacific
Arctic -- alongside Chinese inroads in circumpolar governance and
presence.]{.underline}

The July 2024 [Ukrainian drone strike7]{.underline}) on the Olenya air
base in the northwestern Russian Arctic, where strategic bombers are
stationed, [also **[reinforces]{.mark}** their [sense of
**vulnerability**]{.mark} -- not least by **[defying]{.mark}** the
**[genuine effectiveness]{.mark}** of [Russian]{.mark} **regional air
[defense capabilities]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Ultimately[, Moscow does not want to be dispossessed of its control over
the AZRF. The fact that NATO's direct borders with Russia have increased
in size in the Arctic and Baltic theaters will undoubtedly push the
Kremlin to adapt its **[force projection]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

For instance, although [[Russia]{.mark} has increased its focus on the
**[central]{.mark}** and **[eastern parts]{.mark}** of the]{.underline}
[**Arctic**, especially since 2010, the [**main centre** of
**gravity**]{.mark} for **military [investments]{.mark}** [and
**activities**]{.mark} has remained the **High North**, i.e. the
European (or western) Arctic. In this part of the region, the **[Russian
military presence]{.mark}** is [centred]{.mark} around the [Northern
Fleet]{.mark}]{.underline} deployed on [the **[Kola
Peninsula]{.mark}**]{.underline}, just across the border from NATO
member Norway. This remains [the [**strongest part** of the **Russian
Navy**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which also [constitutes the foundation of
the **fifth military district**]{.underline}. [The **Northern Fleet**
hosts the largest share of Russian strategic submarines
(**[SSBNs]{.mark}**), in addition to modernized and **new nuclear**,
**strategic non-nuclear** and other **conventional forces**]{.underline}
that could threaten other states. In addition, Moscow considers security
challenges and threats in this part of the Arctic, where Russia shares a
border with NATO, an immediate security concern. [Hence, this subregion
plays a special role in Russia's security and defence thinking,
[notably]{.mark} in **[nuclear]{.mark}** and **[naval
strategies]{.mark}**, with missions extending beyond the Arctic
region.]{.underline}

Conversely, [key **[security challenges]{.mark}** in the
[central]{.mark} and [eastern]{.mark} parts of the **[Russian
Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline} belong to the further future. [They are
expected to be [generated]{.mark} by [growing **human
activity**]{.mark}]{.underline}, largely deriving from economic
development, which, to date, has been non-linear and expanded below
Russia's expectations. The [infrastructure Russia has been developing on
the Arctic islands in the central and eastern part of the region has a
predominantly **defensive character**]{.underline} and includes new
radar stations, [**[early-warning capabilities]{.mark}**, and
[coastal]{.mark} and **[air defences]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Third, the [Arctic is strategically [intertwined]{.mark} with other
[security spaces]{.mark} in **Russian thinking**]{.underline}. The
Russian Armed Forces, in particular in the European part of the region,
have possible roles assigned in the case of escalation of a major
conflict involving another great power elsewhere. Russia sees the
various regions along its western perimeter (the High North, the Baltic
Sea and the Black Sea regions) as interconnected security spaces. As the
'Zapad' and 'Kavkaz' [[**Russian annual** large-scale
**exercises**]{.mark} have [demonstrated]{.mark} over the
years]{.underline}, if there is a [[regional-level conflict]{.mark}
along [Russia's western border]{.mark}, the [Northern Fleet]{.mark} may
not only [deploy]{.mark} its '[bastion defence']{.mark} concept to
protect the bases and operational area for **SSBNs**,]{.underline} but
also [[engage]{.mark} in [**horizontal** and/or **vertical
escalation**]{.mark} i]{.underline}n order to pressure opponents from
another strategic direction. In addition, [Russian forces in the Arctic
can be used in a conflict outside the region for **pragmatic
reasons**]{.underline}. Despite extensive military modernization in all
defence branches, Russia's military capability remains limited. [Russia
has repeatedly drawn on these forces when **necessary**]{.underline}, as
with the deployment of the 200th Motor-Rifle Brigade of the Northern
Fleet to Ukraine's Donbas region in 2014 and to northern Ukraine in
2022, or the participation of the Northern Fleet in large-scale military
exercises in other regions (e.g. Vostok--2018).

#### [NATO deterrence over Svalbard makes accelerates conflict.]{.underline} 

Màlna Szonja **Vàmos 24**, writer at Atlantic Forumn, 03/22/2024, NATO's
Geopolitical Dilemma in the Arctic,
https://www.atlantic-forum.com/our-views/zt4rk9hyufc3n8d159yia63h1z77ef

Since the end of the Cold War many countries in the West, especially the
countries of the High North exercised care in their approach to
international and regional affairs. A [binary [perception]{.mark} of
[war and peace]{.mark} served as a strategic instrument to simplify
**complex scenarios**]{.underline} into manageable paradigms, as the
example of the Swedish and Finish nonalignment policy shows. This binary
approach is, however, notably [advantageous for nations like
**[Russia]{.mark}**, offering]{.underline} them **[[room to
maneuver]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As Western [democracies and
**[NATO]{.mark} Allies** [grapple]{.mark} with the **[delicate
balance]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[between]{.underline}
**[security]{.underline}**]{.mark} and
**[[diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the binary mindset continues to
[shape their **strategic considerations**]{.underline} in the [evolving
landscape of the **Arctic**.]{.underline} A perfect illustration of this
diplomatic tightrope walking is the fact that the cooperation between
Russia and Norway has not stopped and was not even sanctioned by Oslo on
shared responsibilities in the region, like coast guard tasks.
[**[Continuing collaboration]{.mark}** under strained political ties is
[**strategically crucial** for both]{.mark}]{.underline}, not only
Norway. The [[potential losses]{.mark} from terminating dialogue,
especially due to disagreement [over]{.mark}
**[Svalbard]{.mark}**]{.underline}, would lead to **[[politically
charged consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Moscow is aware that more
than half of the 50 signatories of the Svalbard Treaty are NATO member
countries.. The geopolitical environment of the Arctic is clearly
unfavorable for Russia to directly confront Norway, and Oslo evidently
is in a position where entering into any disagreement with Moscow is far
from ideal. The effectiveness of deterrence remains key. In the recent
decade, [both sides have been [working towards **complete
transparency**]{.mark} in their **[dialogue]{.mark}** for the
[purpose]{.mark} of [avoiding]{.mark} any **[misunderstanding]{.mark}**
around **shared obligations** in the region]{.underline}. However, this
does not mean that Svalbard is both legally and geopolitically settled,.
All signatories to the Treaty are allowed to de facto establish
strategic fortresses on the archipelago and become beneficiaries of a
free use of the land. As the Treaty only specifies land areas and
various islands (Svalbard Treaty Article 1, 1920) (5), the question of
whether the continental shelf could become subject to economic activity
is being challenged by Russia .It could be argued the term 'territory'
connotes land areas explicitly, and not adjacent waters, unless
qualified by such an adjective as 'maritime'. Russian arguments mainly
follow this line of thinking when it comes to legal questions of the
Svalbard Treaty, [despite the **customary interpretation of
international law**, whereby territory would usually be considered to
apply also to the adjacent sea. [Russia]{.mark} does [not]{.mark}
[recognize]{.mark} **Norway's exclusive [rights]{.mark}** to the
continental shelf around the archipelago and aims to make use of the
[concept]{.mark} of [forward territorializing]{.mark} interests [over
**Svalbard's**]{.mark} emerging resources,]{.underline} especially in an
age of rapid ice melt. Furthermore, Svalbard is geographically ideal for
the establishment of undersea infrastructure (internet/communication
cables) and satellite control stations, which comes with the risk of
gray-zone mischief on different levels. Russia's history in the testing
of mainly hybrid capacities in the High North such as GPS jamming or the
potential use of the successfully tested methods of destroying critical
infrastructure in Ukraine, raises a reasonable concern in the Alliance
when it comes to the usage of these capacities for warlike purposes. The
relatively easy accessibility of the land -- legally backed by the
Svalbard Treaty -- for Arctic and non-Arctic countries expands the scale
of the threat and raises the issue of the 'dual use' of the North Pole.

only in east-west multilateral cooperation, but also in north-south
state-indigenous cooperation, this new bifurcation into re-emergent
Arctic blocs threatens the transnational and indigenous unity of the
Arctic, with multiple indigenous homelands undergoing a de facto
partitioning, reversing the gains achieved since the Cold War's end.

Finally, it is important to note that [[there are **no multilateral

[address this **critical**]{.underline}]{.mark} security
**[[gap]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Otherwise, [[NATO risks triggering

of a Russian attack on Svalbard, NATO requires unanimous consensus to
invoke Article 5's collective defense obligations. Up to this point,
[Russia has **complied** with the **UNCLOS**]{.underline}, and "if the
Alliance can take the lead on a resolution to that issue and provide a

[Risks of miscalculation]{.underline}

A more [vulnerable yet assertive Russia in the Arctic, coupled with more
**[NATO attention]{.mark}**]{.underline} towards the region, [can only
[mean]{.mark} that the [risk of miscalculation]{.mark} [provoked]{.mark}

[accidents]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[incidents]{.underline}**, and
**[[tactical errors]{.underline}]{.mark}** will
**[[increase]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Because of the [[absence]{.mark} of
clear lines of **[communication]{.mark}** and **[deconfliction]{.mark}**
between Russia and the Arctic 7 countries]{.underline}, it [could
[lead]{.mark} to **[unintended escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
further down the road, to military tension if not conflict.

This [[situation]{.mark} is [worsened]{.mark} by the fact that
**[Moscow's restraint]{.mark}**]{.underline} over [such events [cannot

exemplified by Russia's continued **[low intensity]{.mark}** [warfare
**operations**]{.mark} in peacetime against **Arctic nations** and
**[NATO]{.mark} allies**]{.underline}. Finally, the absence of Russian
transparency regarding recent environmental disasters17) in the region
adds more complexity to peacefully solving potential crises

Another form of risk [relates to [horizontal

rapprochement promises to [restore **East-West

[states]{.mark}**]{.underline}, who continue to worry about Russia and
fear the US may next undermine their security interests, much the same

In the months ahead, with [[NATO]{.mark} in crisis and the **Arctic

[now on [separate sides]{.mark} of an [intra-alliance conflict,]{.mark}
there is much to be [**concerned** about in the
**Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline}. But the [restoration of a **positive

Russia does help to [defuse one of the most pressing **security
risks**]{.underline} facing the Arctic in recent years, that of
[[continued Russian aggression]{.mark} against the West, which the White
House may be better [positioned to **dissuade**]{.mark} with **Moscow**
[now]{.mark} in **[greater alignment]{.mark}** with
**Washington**.]{.underline}

Whether this will reassure [Finland and Sweden]{.underline}, which had
both turned to the West for their collective defense, only to see NATO
itself stumble into what could prove to be an existential crisis, may
soon make them [long for their days of **neutrality**]{.underline},
[when they did not **depend** **entirely** upon the **United States** or

Why NATO's [[Arctic Expansion]{.mark} Is Now

What [began as a [show of unity]{.mark} against Russian aggression is
[now revealing]{.mark} its **[internal

enlargement]{.mark}**]{.underline}, once framed as a stabilizing move,
has [[fractured]{.mark} the very [alliances]{.mark} it [sought]{.mark}
to **[strengthen]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[splitting **indigenous

diplomacy]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and [[provoking]{.underline}
**[intra-alliance tensions]{.underline}**]{.mark} [from **Greenland** to

Instead of reinforcing cooperation, the [**[expansion]{.mark}** has
**[accelerated militarization]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[revived **Cold

[multilateral ethos]{.mark} that once [defined **Arctic

[3.5 Spillover: **NATO** in the **Arctic** and **Arctic**
relations]{.underline}

Given the [finding that [NATO hostility]{.mark} has been naturalized as
near-total in **[Russian official statements]{.mark}**]{.underline}
since 2014, we would expect the [general [hostile
intent]{.mark}]{.underline} and posture ascribed to [NATO elsewhere to
[spill over]{.mark}, shaping understandings of **NATO** in the
**Arctic**.]{.underline} Here we seek to uncover whether the pattern of
identification of NATO elsewhere is replicated in Russian statements on
NATO in the Arctic region. We also investigate whether the established
discourse on the Arctic as a "uniquely collaborative space" is
reiterated and whether (or not) it restrains the securitization of NATO
or the level of hostility attached to diverse Western actors in this
region.

In Russian representations of the Arctic we find a dual pattern; on the
one hand, resistance to securitization emanating from the discourse on
the Arctic as a cooperative space with cooperative actors; on the other,
full "contamination" in terms of NATO hostility. Tellingly, despite many
references to NATO in a range of contexts in these Arctic texts, we have
not encountered a single instance where NATO is mentioned in non-hostile
terms. Further, there is evident replication in the representations of
NATO across the three analytical categories outlined above.

While the Baltic region is identified as being subjected to
"militarization" before the Arctic,155 in April 2015 this region is
actively framed as part of the new dangerous world which NATO is
creating. Defence Minister Shoigu notes that "with the geographical
concentration of the NATO exercise areas, exclusively on the eastern
flank of the alliance and the Arctic region ... the alliance has dropped
its propaganda clichés of past years about cooperation with Russia".156
NATO/USA are repeatedly identified as the sole source of this new
situation, for instance: "Speaking about potential sources of mounting
tensions in the region, it would be logical to consider the United
States and its allies' military activities in the Arctic that go
hand-in-hand with belligerent rhetoric. In fact, NATO and NATO member
states, including non-Arctic countries, are carrying out provocations
there and are doing so on an increasingly regular basis".157

The notion of NATO's false nature is also prominent: NATO is alleged to
be consistently dishonest in its statements, " turning the facts on
their head ".158 NATO's Janus-faced nature is reinforced when Russia
declares that statements and policies in the Arctic are " based on
completely perverse facts on an imaginary Russian threat" to justify its
own existence.159 NATO is also reneging on old promises and agreements,
such as the 1997 Russia--NATO Founding Act and the Norwegian policy of
'self-imposed restraints'."160 Moreover, the representation of NATO as
necessarily offensive is recirculated, including by use of the
geopolitics trope, in claims such as "The North Atlantic Alliance
\[has\] set eyes on the Arctic as an area for its long-term military
plans and interests, while the activities of the NATO member states in
the Arctic region are increasingly becoming systemic and provocative
thus transforming the Arctic into a ground of geopolitical
competition".161 The latter statement also shows that the
conspiracy-theory view of NATO/West is manifest in the Arctic. Concerted
efforts are allegedly being made by NATO and its Arctic members to
dismantle the state of cooperative and peaceful relations in the Arctic
while simultaneously asserting a more hostile military posture. Russia
is on the receiving end of this conspiracy.162

NATO's hybrid ways are restated when NATO's statements on the need for
deterrence in the Arctic are described as a "... corruption of logic,
facts, common sense, or any idea of decency and respect ..." and when
NATO activities in the region are repeatedly referred to as
'provocations' close to Russia's borders.163 Such statements reflect
deep concern about any NATO manoeuvre in the Arctic. Every new
development is noted by the MOD and painted as yet another dangerous
move against Russia.164 Symptomatically, a specific grievance like the
US rotational bases in Norway in July 2018 is cited as evidence of a
larger trend of increased "tension and destabilization of the situation
in the northern region ..., an element of the US-led military
preparations, which have intensified against the background of
anti-Russian propaganda hysteria".165 Indeed the presence of NATO in the
Arctic is presented as destabilising and hostile: "... we are convinced
that these wargames as well as the general build-up of NATO's military
presence in the high latitudes by no means facilitate the strengthening
of peace and stability in the Arctic".166

[[Arctic **peace** and **stability**]{.mark} are constantly invoked in
**Russian discourse**, whereas the **[NATO]{.mark}** Other is routinely
[projected]{.mark} as a **rising** [threat]{.mark} to this unique
area]{.underline}. Thus, rather than contributing to halt the
securitization of NATO in the Arctic, [Russia's invoking of the peace
and stability trope while juxtaposing it to NATO's nature and activities
creates the opposite effect. Moreover, [in these texts
**Russia**]{.mark} is [construed]{.mark} as the [protector of peace and
stability]{.mark}, in line with its law-abiding, benign and **[defensive
nature]{.mark}** -- in alleged contrast to NATO, thereby [underlining
**NATO hostility**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, "... the Russian
Navy ... complies with international law without creating any security
threats for Norway".167 "[Everything [Russia]{.mark} is doing there is
**absolutely legal**]{.underline}."168 [Russian efforts to augment its
own **military forces**]{.underline} in the region are [presented as
merely [responding]{.mark} to [NATO's efforts]{.mark} at
**[containment]{.mark}**]{.underline}.169 Furthermore, [[Russia **sees
itself**]{.mark} as [trying]{.mark} to **[defuse
tensions]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the region, but its [efforts are
ignored and frustrated by a **NATO**]{.underline} that is [unwilling to
alter its **course**]{.underline}: "We have proposed discussing issues
of mutual concern on numerous occasions. Regrettably, we do not see any
response".170

Beyond the highly securitized and naturalized Russian representation of
NATO as hostile in the Arctic, what of the Arctic NATO states? While the
cooperative baseline still frames such individual countries to some
extent, their increasing engagement with(in) NATO leads to overall
representations of them as hostile. Norway, for example, has figured as
a "good neighbour" in connection with bi- and multilateral cooperation,
such as a 2010 maritime delimitation agreement.171 Increasingly,
however, Norway is identified as a loyal and eager NATO member -- and
thereby partially conflated with it being an unreliable and hostile
agent that threatens Russia from all directions. Examples include
allowing US forces to deploy to Norway for extended rotation periods, or
hosting NATO exercises or NATO nuclear submarines.172 Norway's signing a
bilateral defence cooperation agreement with the USA in April 2021 is
seen as "fully in line with the policy of military build-up and an
active involvement of NATO in the Arctic"... "We regard such activities,
especially in direct proximity to the Russian border, as Oslo's
deliberate and destructive line towards aggravating tensions in the
Euro-Arctic region and destroying Russian-Norwegian relations".173

Norway is further included in the hostile NATO sphere through statements
such as "The territory of Norway has been turned into a bridgehead for
NATO's advance to the Arctic".174 The image of a "false" NATO/Norway is
evident in expressions such as "The statements made by Norway's
political authorities about their alleged desire to maintain good
relations with Moscow \[which\] contradict the country's actual
destructive policy of deterrence against Russia".175 Clearly, the
words/actions dichotomy firmly established in Russian discourse on NATO
as such (see section 3.2) have travelled into the discourse on Norway
and the Arctic. Given such alleged Norwegian dishonesty in their
relations, Russia "will have to take this into account when making
national security plans".176 Thus, although Norway still has a dual
identification, it is increasingly construed as a hostile actor and its
Arctic territory as hostile ground. In view of such mounting strategic
certainty, new national security plans will be made on the Russian side.

Norway is not the only NATO country with a dual identification. If MFA
statements are taken at face value, Russia is not certain about US
hostile intent as regards the Arctic: In February 2019 Lavrov states
that he "do\[es\] not know" whether the USA wants conflict in the
Arctic, but that he "very much hope\[s\]" that the American "habit" of
"aggravating relations ... will not manifest itself in the Arctic".177
In fact, the USA is often framed in positive terms in connection with
certain events and initiatives, as in a press release on a
Russian--American Pacific Partnership meeting -- but this holds only for
non-military issues.178 Likewise regarding the UK: for example,
statements on commemorations of the WWII Arctic Convoys include phrases
such as "Russia will always remember with gratitude how the anti-Hitler
coalition members extended a helping hand to the Soviet Union".179
Similar historical sentiments are expressed about Norway in relation to
commemorations of the 1944/1945 liberation of Finnmark, where Foreign
Minister Lavrov declared himself "really touched by their attention".180
Representations of hostility are tempered by the recirculation in
official Russian speech of historical events that bind Russia and
several NATO members together as brothers in arms facing the existential
Nazi threat -- in contrast to the previously noted Cold War analogies.

As to representations of the Arctic as such, the majority of MFA
statements continue to emphasize international cooperation and economic
opportunities in this region.181 The Arctic Council is still said to be
"a very useful organization" and "probably one of the few structures
that is not affected by geopolitical squabbles".182 Our concern is that
although individual Arctic NATO countries still enjoy dual
identification as "frenemies", the latter part of this identification is
accentuated. We would hold that this kind of identification encourages
Russia to assume NATO-country hostility in a cooperative area like the
Arctic and in the Arctic Council, now and in the near future: the logic
of the MFA and MOD establishes hostility/cynicism as the safest bet.
Indeed, recent Russian statements indicate that cooperation in the
Arctic Council is under pressure from the "strategic certainty" of NATO
hostility: "This desire to militarize the Arctic and use the region for
implementing the notorious policy of containing Russia causes legitimate
concerns. Unfortunately, the facts of the Arctic Council member states'
participation in these military actions are piling up. We believe that
this conduct does little to maintain an atmosphere of trust and
cooperation between the Arctic countries".183 We might be facing a
smothering Russian ability to distinguish the Western Arctic Council
countries from the hostile face of NATO. With such conflation distrust
can spill over and effect relations in the Arctic Council.

4 Conclusions

Our empirical analysis in 3.1-3.4 shows that Russian official discourse
in the years following the conflict in Ukraine construes NATO as
"genetically" set on grabbing ever more geopolitical space while
claiming to seek security for all states. Russia generally represents
NATO as a two-faced actor, hiding its true agenda of incessant expansion
behind the "invented" "thesis" of Russian threat and distractions like
"instrumentalized" universal values. This idea of a false West hiding
the real reasons for its value agenda has deep roots in Russian
thinking.184 Our analysis shows that this view fundamentally structures
Russia's interpretation of NATO, in turn illustrating how discursive
change -- the making of hostility through intense securitization and
naturalization -- takes place on the background of continued,
long-nurtured rhetorical tropes.

[Our analysis has also shown how all [**spheres** and
**actions**]{.mark} are entangled, [seen]{.mark} as part of **[NATO's
war-like]{.mark}** campaign [targeting **Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The [Russian leadership conflates **[Russia-critical
statements]{.mark}** and [conventional military
**build-up**]{.mark}]{.underline} into a [single package of
**hostility**]{.underline}. We conclude that MOD and MFA representations
post-Crimea attach a near-total level of [danger to **NATO** and
associated Western others]{.underline}. Here we wish to emphasize the
extreme density and repetitive nature of these representations in our
material. They confirm previous scholarly claims that the entrenched
worldview in the Kremlin is that the West with NATO is threatening to
destroy Russia.185 [Our study has shown how such a worldview is
constructed through official statements on a day-to-day basis, becoming
**naturalized**]{.underline}. Further, the overall impression is that
[Russia deems **conspiracy** as the **signature tune** of both **NATO**
and the **USA**]{.underline}. The "lesson learned" as per official
speech post-Crimea thus seems to be that [Russia should never trust
**NATO** promises again -- anywhere.]{.underline}

From our analysis of texts on NATO in the Arctic we find that the
[**[dramatically]{.mark}** heightened [level]{.mark} of
**[securitization]{.mark}** of this **Western antagonist** is almost
fully [replicated]{.mark} in this **polar region**]{.underline}. We
cannot ignore the pattern of representation of [NATO as [**hostile** by
nature]{.mark}]{.underline}, with its [every move in the Arctic as the
next step in a [planned offensive against
**Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This image is achieved through use of
predicates, juxtapositions of selves and others (Russia embodies
cooperative Arctic in the face of NATO threat), the recirculation of
rhetorical tropes of enmity and discursive merger of social entities
that might have been framed as distinct and "friendly". By these
mechanisms, relations with individual Arctic NATO states are
increasingly rephrased through the prism of NATO hostility, with Norway
as a prime example.

Although our findings may indicate the impossibility of
compartmentalizing the Arctic away from rising Russia--NATO enmity, our
material also shows Russian resistance to the securitization of
relations in this region -- as when interactions and institutions in the
Arctic are recirculated as benign encounters and arenas or when official
language invokes dual identifications of NATO countries, using
historical tropes or predicates of amity. Indeed, the discursive lumping
together of different Western political entities into one hostile agent
is not complete in the Arctic context.

Entering these findings into the framework and debate about the
securitization dilemma, locating them as part of a broader Russia--West
interaction pattern, addresses several questions. As to how misplaced
certainty about the other party's intent emerges, we suggest that Russia
creates certainty about NATO's hostility through the way it repeatedly
and with increasing fervour speaks of this political entity. Moreover,
with NATO's growing European presence and concerns over the "Russian
threat", Russian leaders increasingly indicate that the West's
previously hidden agenda is now out in the open. This "uncovering"
cements the view of NATO's intent as undeniably hostile.

As to the question of distrust, so often said to be the driver of
security dilemma dynamics, we hold that the power of spoken words is
underrated.186 Although assessing such emotional qualities is beyond the
reach of our methodology, we would highlight the contingent nature of
trust -- thus rejecting distrust between Russia and NATO as something
given and unchanging. The historical animosity between Russia and NATO
does matter for the growing securitization dilemma in the Arctic and
elsewhere in Europe, because political speakers make it matter -- for
example, by repeatedly re-inserting Cold War references into the debate
and re-phrasing Cold War relations as sheer hostility. Also, trust can
be rebuilt, by imagining and giving voice to positive identifications of
and cooperative experiences with the Western Others. Here the Arctic has
a clear potential, but that can be realised only if political actors
decide to act.

As our study has shown, [the [constant invoking of **NATO
activity**]{.mark} as hostile in contrast to **Russia's** **[alledgedly
reactive]{.mark}** and **defensive posture** serves as the [core
**legitimizing argument** for]{.mark} the upgrading and
[modernization]{.mark} of the [Russian military]{.mark}]{.underline} --
already a practical reality. However, in facing this practical reality
it will be up to [NATO, not [Russia]{.mark}, to [judge]{.mark} the
**[underlying intentions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Here emerges the larger
picture of a [[downwards spiralling]{.mark} of **[mutual
securitization]{.mark}**]{.underline} between two actors who both claim
to be seeking security only. On this background, we [feel that holding
back the rhetorical **[trench war]{.mark}**]{.underline} is a necessary
step toward mitigating tragedy (in the security dilemma sense). For
[these representations matter beyond the nuisance of a loud and
aggressive Russia--**West conversation**]{.underline} -- they matter in
order to avoid a military conflict that neither side wants.

[[Russia]{.mark} has a [larger **military

**NATO**]{.mark}]{.underline} and has been [**[investing]{.mark}** in
and **[upgrading]{.mark}** its]{.underline} [[Soviet-era
**facilities**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Chatham House, a UK think tank,
[[says]{.mark} this is **defensive** in nature]{.underline} and that the
[Kremlin is [opposed]{.mark} to the [idea]{.mark} of [starting a

the Center for Strategic and International Studies, [Moscow is rather
"[pursuing **economic ambitions**, **protecting**]{.mark} its
**[second-strike nuclear capabilities]{.mark}** and **projecting power**
into the Central Arctic, Bering Sea and North Atlantic".]{.underline}

The Arctic Institute adds to this, saying that [Russia's control of the
North Sea Route (**[NSR]{.mark}**) would [give]{.mark} an
"**[economic]{.mark}** and [**diplomatic** lever]{.mark} with which to
extend their regional **influence**]{.underline}", highlighting how the
Russian Northern Fleet has increased its surface and underwater
monitoring of the route. The U.S. Department of Defense takes a stronger
rhetoric, stating in its 2024 Arctic Strategy that Russia's maritime
infrastructure could allow it to enforce "excessive and illegal maritime
claims" along the NSR between the Bering Strait and Kara Strait in the
future. The document also highlights new logistical challenges in the
region due to climate change as well [as U.S. concern over the
competition of a **co-operating** **Russia** and **China**, the latter
of which has also shown interest in being a part of the region\'s
developments, calling itself a "near-Arctic state".]{.underline}

[**[NATO]{.mark}** too has [carried out **drills**]{.mark}]{.underline}
and increased its might in the arena, with the addition of Sweden and
Finland to the group last year. The U.S. DoD says it is [**[monitoring

systems]{.underline}** in the vast region to "[[ensure]{.mark} the
**Arctic** does not become a strategic blind spot]{.underline}." Data
published by Foreign Policy illustrates how in Europe, Norway has 13
Arctic bases, including a new addition, Camp Viking, a UK training
ground for Royal Marines Commandos. This source shows the U.S. to have
nine bases in Alaska in addition to those in Greenland and Iceland.
Despite U.S. President Donald Trump's reiteration of wanting to buy
Greenland in the past weeks, [[Washington]{.mark} has said it has [no

Isolation of Russia

In the first scenario, [[Russia]{.mark} becomes completely
**[isolated]{.mark}** in the **Arctic**]{.underline}, as a
[[result]{.mark} of effective and long-lasting
[Western]{.mark}]{.underline} sanctions that severely [[harm]{.mark}
Russia's **[economy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This scenario would then
[[lead]{.mark} to [Moscow's reaction]{.mark} in the [form]{.mark} of
**[cutting]{.mark}** the rest of the [ties]{.mark} [with]{.mark} the
**[West]{.mark}** and its allies]{.underline}, and the [Russian
**[nuclear arsenal]{.mark}** would become a [crucial tool]{.mark} in
**[safeguarding]{.mark}**]{.underline} its [**[security]{.mark}** and
**strategic goals**]{.underline}. Thus[, Russia would safeguard and
possibly [improve]{.mark} its **[second-strike nuclear
capacity]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the [Northern Fleet]{.underline} as
its [conventional military forces **deteriorate**]{.underline}.
President **[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}** might even [try to
[demonstrate]{.mark} that [Russia]{.mark} is still a **[relevant
force]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}to be feared by [conducting
military shows in the area and [exercising]{.mark} its **[nuclear
capacity]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

This scenario [carries a [higher risk]{.mark} of
**[escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, either
**[[accidentally]{.underline}]{.mark}** or
**[[deliberately]{.underline}]{.mark}**. \[25\] Even though [some Arctic
experts [call for **renewing**]{.mark} the **[cooperation]{.mark}**
within the region,]{.underline} the newly released Biden's

possibility for government-to-government cooperation is almost
nonexistent. \[35\]

### Impact\-\--AT: Deterrence\-\--2NC

#### The Arctic is stabilized by lack of NATO [advancement]{.underline}. Russia's Trinity ensures [peace]{.underline} in the squo. 

Kari **Roberts 24**, writer at the Arctic Institute, 11/19/2024, \"Past
Need Not Be Prologue: Applying the Lessons of History to NATO-Russia
Relations in the Arctic\",

Enemy or Adversary? The Importance of Framing in **[NATO-Russia Arctic
Relations]{.underline}**

It is [well-established in **international relations**]{.underline}
that, while [**enemies** do not recognize each other's legitimacy and
therefore seek to destroy each other]{.underline}, [adversaries or
rivals respect one another's **right to exist**]{.underline}.24) The
[[enemy framing]{.mark} of **[Russia]{.mark}** is a [worrying
basis]{.mark} for the **[cooperation]{.mark}** that both **Russia** and
**Western Arctic states** claim to desire in the **North**]{.underline},
and which is articulated in various national Arctic strategy and defence
documents and public statements.25)

Elizabeth [[Buchanan]{.underline}]{.mark} aptly reminds that cooperation
does not mean the total absence of conflict, and can refer more
specifically to the pursuit of shared interests. She explains that "the
[strategic [basis]{.mark} for Russia's Arctic [agenda]{.mark} is more or
**less [cooperative]{.mark}**]{.underline}" because it seeks to
"[[regain **great power status**]{.mark} on the [back]{.mark} of its
**[energy wealth]{.mark}**]{.underline}."26) Therefore, Buchanan goes on
to observe that it is in [Russia's [national interest]{.mark} to [avoid
**intensified conflict**]{.mark}]{.underline} in a region that
[[represents "**Putin's Trinity**]{.underline}]{.mark}" -- the
[confluence of **[Russia's great power ambitions]{.mark}**, [**energy
interests**, and **dominance**]{.mark} in the
[Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[There are [some]{.mark} who [advocate]{.mark} for the [isolation of
**Russia**]{.mark} from **Arctic**]{.underline} regional fora, as
penance for its unprovoked and brutal attack on Ukraine, and owing to
fears that engagement only legitimizes or excuses Russian aggression.
This view is understandable, especially in the short term, but [could
[backfire]{.mark} if [Russia]{.mark} is [pushed so far]{.mark} into a
**[corner]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- [[isolated]{.mark} in a [region of
**critical economic**]{.mark} and **[strategic
importance]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- that it [perceives a [need for
**backlash**]{.mark} in response]{.underline}.27) Buchanan notes that it
is [easy to see the Arctic as a theater for **geopolitical
tension**]{.underline}. It is [much less complicated for **Western
leaders** to refuse **nuance**, **deny communication**, and enable an
enemy image of **Russia**]{.underline} in the [Arctic to
**flourish**]{.underline}, rather than do the hard work of coexisting
with an adversary whose actions they denounce.

[**[Russia]{.mark}** has [prioritized **military development**]{.mark}
in support of its **[desire]{.mark}** to **[dominate]{.mark}** the
**[Russian Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}, to [assert its sovereignty in
its **NSR**, protect its **economic interests**, and to
[demonstrate]{.mark} its **[power capabilities]{.mark}**.28) Given the
high stakes for Russia in the region, this [may]{.mark} be
[enough]{.mark} to [prioritize]{.mark} safe and **cooperative
engagement**]{.underline} with Western Arctic states, whose goals are
not all that different. It is no surprise [that Russia wishes to
[protect]{.mark} its **[strategic energy]{.mark}**
reserves]{.underline}. After all, it is a global leader in gas, oil, and
coal production, a leading exporter of LNG, and the Arctic accounts for
10 percent of Russian GDP and 20 percent of all its exports.29)
Understanding these interests is important if there is any hope of
moving away from ideologically motivated assessments of Russia's
"intentions" when making threat assessments.

To be fair, Russia is not always consistent in its Arctic messaging.
Buchanan notes that "the misreading of Russian Arctic strategy has a lot
to do with residual Cold War geopolitical story lines, but it also stems
from mixed signals from Russia itself about its intentions in the
region,"30[) which are largely motivated by **Putin's aggressive**
rhetorical style, and a **perceived** need to [respond to what is seen
as **aggressive NATO**]{.mark} [posturing]{.mark} as its **hardware**
[moves closer to **Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This response is
sometimes welcomed by those Buchanan labels an "[Arctic strategic panic
group]{.underline}," who may [stand to benefit from the steady drumbeat
of alarm about **Russian motives**. It also helps to justify the views
of those who prefer to signal the virtues of isolating Russia as
punishment for its human rights abuses in **Ukraine** and its
flouting]{.underline} [of **international laws**]{.underline} and norms.
While these approaches are understandable, the lessons of the past tell
us that punitively cutting off communication with Russia rarely gets us
anywhere. Though it is difficult to do, it is crucial to avoid framing
relations with [Russia in the Arctic as **irretrievably**
**uncooperative**]{.underline}, and to consider instead what measures
can be taken to prevent future cooperation from becoming impossible.

#### NATO [expansion]{.underline} is [conflict]{.underline} driving. [Ukraine]{.underline} Proves. 

Ted Galen **Carpenter 22**, Former Senior Fellow, 2-28-2022, \"Many
Predicted NATO Expansion Would Lead to War. Those Warnings Were
Ignored\",
https://www.cato.org/commentary/many-predicted-nato-expansion-would-lead-war-those-warnings-were-ignored

[[Russia's military offensive]{.mark} against Ukraine is an [act of
aggression]{.mark} that will make already **[worrisome
tensions]{.mark}** between **[Nato]{.mark}** and **[Moscow]{.mark}**
even **more dangerous**]{.underline}. The west's new cold war with
Russia has turned hot. [Vladimir Putin bears [primary
responsibility]{.mark} for this [latest
**development**]{.mark}]{.underline}, but
**[[Nato's]{.underline}]{.mark}** arrogant, tone-deaf policy toward
Russia over the past quarter-century [[deserves a **large
share**]{.mark} as well]{.underline}. [Analysts committed to a US
foreign policy of **[realism]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}and
**[[restraint]{.underline}]{.mark}** have [warned for more than a
quarter-century that continuing to expand the most powerful **military
alliance**]{.underline} in history toward another major power would not
end well. The war in Ukraine provides definitive confirmation that it
did not.

Thinking through the Ukraine crisis --- the causes

"It would be [[extraordinarily difficult]{.mark} to [expand
**Nato**]{.mark} **eastward** [without that **action's**]{.mark} being
viewed by Russia as **unfriendly**]{.underline}. Even the most modest
schemes would bring the alliance to the borders of the old Soviet Union.
[Some of the more **ambitious versions** would have the alliance
**virtually** surround the Russian Federation itself]{.underline}." I
wrote those words in 1994, in my book Beyond Nato: Staying Out of
Europe's Wars, at a time when expansion proposals merely constituted
occasional speculation in foreign policy seminars in New York and
Washington. I added that expansion "would [constitute a [needless
provocation]{.mark} of **[Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline}".

What was not publicly known at the time was that Bill Clinton's
administration had already made the fateful decision the previous year
to push for including some former Warsaw Pact countries in Nato. The
administration would soon propose inviting Poland, the Czech Republic
and Hungary to become members, and the US Senate approved adding those
countries to the North Atlantic Treaty in 1998. It would be the first of
several waves of membership expansion.

It has long been clear that [[NATO expansion]{.mark} would [lead to
**tragedy**]{.mark}.]{.underline} We are now paying the price for the
US's arrogance.

Even that first stage provoked Russian opposition and anger. In her
memoir, Madeleine Albright, Clinton's secretary of state, concedes that
"\[Russian president Boris\] Yeltsin and his [countrymen were strongly
opposed to **enlargement**]{.underline}, seeing it as a strategy [for
[**exploiting** their **vulnerability**]{.mark} and moving Europe's
dividing line to the east, [leaving them
**isolated**]{.mark}]{.underline}."

Strobe Talbott, deputy secretary of state, similarly described the
Russian attitude. "[Many **Russians** see **[Nato]{.mark}** as a
[vestige]{.mark} of the [cold war]{.mark}, inherently **directed**
against their country. They point out that they have disbanded the
**Warsaw Pact**, their military alliance]{.underline}, and ask why the
west should not do the same." It was an excellent question, and neither
the Clinton administration nor its successors provided even a remotely
convincing answer.

George Kennan, the intellectual father of America's containment policy
during the cold war, perceptively warned in a May 1998 New York Times
interview about what the Senate's ratification of Nato's first round of
expansion would set in motion. "I think it is the beginning of a new
cold war," Kennan stated. "I think the [[Russians]{.mark} will
**gradually** [react]{.mark} quite **[adversely]{.mark}** and it will
affect their policies. I think it is a **tragic mistake**]{.underline}.
There was no reason for this whatsoever. No one was threatening anybody
else."

He was right, but [[US and Nato leaders]{.mark} proceeded with [new
rounds of **expansion**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [including the provocative
step of [adding]{.mark} the **[three Baltic
republics]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Those countries not only had been part
of the Soviet Union, but they had also been part of Russia's empire
during the Czarist era. That wave of expansion now had Nato perched on

"[The [likelihood of Russia]{.mark} choosing]{.underline} -- or Putin
choosing -- [[to use **nuc**]{.mark}lear weapon**[s]{.mark}** directly
against the West [is **astronomically low**]{.mark}. **It [should not
even be seriously considered]{.mark} at this stage**," says Katherine
Lawlor, senior intelligence analyst at the independent Institute for the
Study of War]{.underline}, which has fastidiously tracked Russia's
military movements since it first invaded Ukraine. "[[Putin would
love]{.mark} it [if]{.mark} Western [leaders **believed**]{.mark} that
[he might]{.mark}. He is many things, [but **he is not
suicidal**]{.mark}]{.underline}," Lawlor says. She adds that Putin
ultimately does not want war with NATO -- particularly given the current
state of the Russian army. "[He couldn't even win a conventional war in
Ukraine]{.underline}." [[Putin's **references** to potential nuclear
war]{.mark} serve as an extension of capitalizing on Russia's limited
economic and military resources to bend others' will. It's [a
**tactic**]{.mark} the Russian leader has **accelerated**]{.underline}
since first invading Ukraine in 2014, shortly before Obama dismissed the
former core of the Soviet Union as nothing more than a "regional power."
The method has worked to some degree, most visibly by isolating Germany
from its traditional ironclad allies in the West due to Berlin's
protracted reluctance to send new forms of military aid to Ukraine's
military. And it has effectively raised concern among experts who
specialize in the potential for nuclear war. "It would be dangerous to
assume that Putin would never use nuclear weapons," says Jon Wolfsthal,
a senior adviser to nuclear disarmament advocacy group Global Zero and a
member of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which annually
publishes its "Doomsday Clock" marking the potential threat of nuclear
war. He notes that approach "has not been adopted by the United States
Government, by NATO nor by the Bulletin." "Blind faith in deterrence
does not guarantee stability, nor does it take heed of the lessons of
history -- recent and more distant -- that deterrence is fragile and can
fail," he says. "As financial and military pressures on Putin grow, the
concern is that he will not think clearly or may put more emphasis on
survival and the destruction of Ukraine than he does on alliances or
friends." The Bulletin advanced the Doomsday Clock to 90 seconds to
midnight in late January -- closer to "midnight," or theoretical
annihilation, than ever before -- citing not only the threat of nuclear
war from Russia with regard to Ukraine but also the spread of disease
and climate volatility that its invasion has exacerbated. Wolfsthal adds
that the primary tools Western leaders have used to deter Russia --
chiefly economic isolation -- have not yet materialized to a level Putin
takes seriously. "He has invaded a sovereign country, committed war
crimes and is engaged in random bombing of civilians, and yet trade with
a number of countries in Europe and elsewhere has increased," he says.
"If there is a major effort to use economic threats to deter Putin's
possible use of nuclear weapons, we have not seen it, and it has not
been visibly communicated to Russia as far as our research indicates."
Others believe that [Putin's most ferocious [nuclear
rhetoric]{.mark}]{.underline} mostly [[exposes the extent to which
the]{.mark} embattled Russian [leader feels **desperate** for]{.mark}
**new sources of [leverage]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They suggest that
leverage is what he was seeking this week with a sudden announcement
that he would suspend Russia's involvement in the New START treaty, the
last nuclear arms control treaty between the U.S. and Russia. "What
[this is]{.underline}, is [a message]{.underline}," says John Erath, a
former top National Security Council official for European affairs, now
senior policy director for the Center for Arms Control and
Non-Proliferation. "For the last six months and more, [Russia\'s
strategy has been to seek leverage on the West to end its support to
Ukraine]{.underline} and suspend the hostilities on terms favorable to
Russia." "This is another ingredient in that stew," he adds. "And like
much Russian food, it is lacking in nutritional value." Erath suggests
that Putin thinks he can trade on the promise of resuming Russia's
obligations to the treaty to convince the U.S. to cease its support for
Ukraine's goals in the war and to acknowledge the Russian army's gains.
"In that sense, [the announcement is a big deal
symbolically]{.underline}," Erath says, adding that Secretary of State
Antony Blinken was right to call the statement "unfortunate and
irresponsible." [Since Putin's decision to invade Ukraine,
[Russia's]{.mark} other [sources of influence are]{.mark} **rapidly
[dwindling]{.mark}**]{.underline} or, more surprisingly, are now exposed
as ineffectual. European countries that previously relied heavily on
flows of Russian energy -- particularly natural gas -- have defied
expectations and survived winter so far without supplies from Moscow.
The endemic rot of corruption within its Ministry of Defense has become
widely exposed. Its conventional military has suffered a string of
embarrassing defeats on the battlefield, including during the beginning
of an ongoing offensive that Russia believed would shift momentum in its
favor. The Institute for the Study of War, like several other private
intelligence firms, believes Putin's nuclear saber-rattling serves more
as an information operation designed to prevent the U.S. and Ukraine's
partners in Europe from providing additional military aid that could be
considered escalatory, such as long-range rockets or sophisticated
tanks. He has had some success, chiefly in Germany's initial hesitancy
to provide Leopard tanks. A year into the war, some things appear to
remain off the table: The U.S. is firmly and vocally opposed to a no-fly
zone, which Ukraine has sought since Day One of the invasion to limit
Russia's ability to attack its defenses and its civilian centers from
the skies. And while American officials publicly say the course of the
war is up to the Ukrainians, they have reportedly bristled at the
suggestion that Kyiv would seek to reclaim the Crimean Peninsula, seized
by Russia in 2014. Similarly, the U.S. has balked at the possibility of
providing weapons that could carry the war into Russia itself. What
Putin also has in his favor is a dramatic reversal in the outlook of
some key figures in the Republican Party, who have inexplicably changed
their perspective on Russia under the leadership of Trump in recent
years. With Moscow once the center of Ronald Reagan's "evil empire" and
more recently viewed as an autocratic state seeking to reestablish an
empire by force at the cost of newly democratic nations, the party of
Trump finds itself with an estimated 97% percent of the Russian army
engaged in a ground war and being routed by a foreign army without the
loss of a single American life -- yet questioning the financial cost of
the commitment. What that means in the course of a presidential campaign
that prominently features Trump and a host of similar-minded Republicans
competing for the base he secured remains to be seen. The 70-year-old
Putin, in office since 1999 and frequently referred to as "president for
life," may conclude he has only to wait out Biden's promises of
steadfast support for Ukraine. But for Putin to follow through on
launching a nuclear attack, he would have to believe that doing so would
achieve a military objective that outweighs the surefire response of a
conventional military response from NATO, as well as the ensured
international isolation from what few partners Russia has left --
chiefly in China and India, where leaders have warned Putin against
nuclear weapons use. [With[**in** Russia]{.mark}, the **[war is not
popular]{.mark}**]{.underline}, though polling suggests Putin has not
yet lost the faith of the majority of ordinary Russians. Still,
[[reports emerge]{.mark} regularly [about]{.mark} the **[lack of
confidence]{.mark}** Russian [troops have in]{.mark} their
[leaders]{.mark} up the chain of command]{.underline} -- leading some
analysts to even speculate whether generals charged with executing
nuclear launch orders would comply with their directives. [Using
**[nuc]{.mark}**lear weapon**[s]{.mark}** also **[wouldn't achieve
Putin's]{.mark} battlefield [aims]{.mark}**. Russian military [doctrine
calls for]{.mark} the use of low-yield nuclear [warheads as a]{.mark}
**last-ditch [tactic]{.mark}**]{.underline} to punch a hole in enemy
lines that mechanized infantry could then exploit. "[The problem is
[Russian forces are **utterly degraded**]{.mark}, absolutely
shattered]{.underline}," Lawlor says. She notes the same is true of the
Ukrainian military but adds that Russia does not currently have a single
deployable division of troops that could carry out that level of
operations. "[Then [factor in NATO retaliation]{.mark} for violating the
nuclear taboo]{.underline}, likely to include conventional missile
strikes on Russian headquarters, ammunition depots and storage
facilities within Ukraine," she says. "[[You've]{.mark} just [**lost**
the operational advantage]{.mark} you might have gained by using
low-yield nuclear weapons]{.underline} -- even if you use 10 or 15."
This scenario, however, exists within Russian offensive operations.
Lawlor adds these circumstances could change if Russia feels it is
squarely in a defensive position and needs to prevent "all-out
disaster." "You have to think about the human response to nuclear use,"
she says, describing the effect on a Ukrainian soldier who witnesses a
rising mushroom cloud several miles away toward the front lines. "The
symbolism is really important in that the Russians may assume it would
have a devastating effect on the morale of the surviving Ukrainian
forces," Lawlor says. "At this stage in the war, though, it's not even
under consideration because the Russians are still conducting offensive
operations." At least some of those who have engaged with Putin directly
agree. Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson revealed earlier this month
that he had received direct warnings from Putin of nuclear war. "He
threatened me at one point, and he said, \'Boris, I don\'t want to hurt
you, but with a missile, it would only take a minute,\' or something
like that. Jolly," the conservative politician told the BBC. Johnson
later explained to Fox News that he believed that what Putin was "trying
to do was creep me out ... trying to reduce it to a story about a
nuclear standoff between Russia and NATO." He [[argued]{.mark} that
[**Putin understands** the **devastating effect** on **Russia** if it
were to launch nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Circle, "Rethinking Arctic Peace and Stability: Moving from Speculation
to Reaffirming Commitments,"
https://www.arcticcircle.org/journal/rethinking-arctic-peace-and-stability-moving-from-speculation-to-reaffirming-commitments\]

Since February 2022, [there have been interpretations and
[**speculations** of]{.mark} an increase of **[militarization]{.mark}**
and emerging **confrontation** [in]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark}. Yet,
there are [**no armed conflicts** or **war**]{.mark}**fare** in the
region]{.underline}, unlike the hot wars and constant warfare in the
Middle East, Africa, Southern Asia and Europe. Instead, [the **Arctic**
Region seems to be in a [state of **constant**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(**[[peace]{.underline}]{.mark}**ful) transformation that affects the
region and the entire Earth mostly by more constructive ways, despite
the deployed heavy nuclear weapon systems of the Russian Federation and
the United States.

[The first significant **transformation** of the Arctic led from the
military **tensions** of the Cold War to **geopolitical
[stability]{.mark}** [based on **cooperation**]{.mark} across
borders]{.underline}. This would not have been possible without the
growing concern among Indigenous Peoples, non-governmental
organisations, civil society, and scholars and scientists over the state
of the region's ecosystems. This concern led to the establishment of
cooperative structures on environmental protection among the Arctic
States and Indigenous Peoples, in particular the Arctic Environmental
Protection Strategy and the Arctic Council. This also caused a shift in
their security premises towards a more comprehensive understanding of
security.

Experience has shown that functional cooperation in the field(s) of low
politics is an efficient way of rebuilding confidence between former
rivals. In terms of the circumpolar North, the most vivid example is
cooperation on [**environmental [protection]{.mark}** due to long-range
air and water **pollution**, which became a **[shared interest]{.mark}**
and **stabilising** factor in the region's **geopolitics** and
**security**]{.underline}. As a result, the eight Arctic States,
supported by Indigenous Peoples Organisations and local communities,
[reconstructed their geopolitical reality committing]{.underline} "[to
[maintain **peace**]{.mark}, [**stability** and]{.mark} constructive
**[cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline}", as stated by Arctic Council
declarations.

When analysing the transformation and reconstruction that has taken
place in the northernmost regions within the last 35 years or so, the
main conclusion is twofold: Firstly, [trans-boundary **cooperation**
indicates the presence of **shared**/common **interests** among the
Arctic **States**]{.underline}, and between them and Arctic Indigenous
Peoples, for example on environmental protection, search and rescue,
scientific cooperation, and economic activities. [Secondly, certain
**specific** features of Arctic **[geopolitics]{.mark}**,
**[security]{.mark}** and **governance**---for example, the original
**nature** of Arctic military for **global [deterrence]{.mark}**, the
**[lack]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} **armed [conflicts]{.mark}** and serious
[**disputes** of]{.mark} **state [sovereignty]{.mark}**, the high degree
of **international** legal **[certainty]{.mark}**, [and
**self-governance**]{.mark}---[made]{.mark} it **[uniquely]{.mark}**
possible to form **[suitable]{.mark}** conditions [for **resilient
cooperation**]{.mark}. This enabled an [**increase** in]{.mark}
geopolitical [**stability** and]{.mark} supported regional
**[development]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[The **[benefits]{.mark}** of **cooperation** and stability are [much
**greater than**]{.mark} those of **[conflict]{.mark}** and
confrontation with high prices]{.underline}.

Recognised as a distinctive, cooperative region, the Arctic became
globalised by major environmental challenges, in particular rapid
climate change and global economic interests such as the mass-scale
utilisation of hydrocarbons. After Russia invaded Ukraine in February
2022, the Arctic started to reflect the patterns of great-power
rivalries and new East-West tension, as the temporary pause of the
Arctic Council and its working groups indicates.

My latest research, published as the Geneva Paper 35/2024, shows that
most of the common interests and special features of Arctic geopolitics
are still in place or can easily be revived, given the necessary
political will. A sustainable solution to the climate crisis---worldwide
and in the Arctic---is based on interdependence. The common interests in
the Arctic reveal such an interdependent nature of the region, made
possible by its special geopolitical features. Cross-border cooperation
in the Arctic is a practical and doable means, as has been shown, even
manifested, in the first decades of the post-Cold War Arctic.

Ultimately, while seven (NATO-aligned) Arctic States might share the
thinking that Russia is no longer a reliable partner, they nevertheless
still share with Russia the undeniable knowledge that the benefits of
cooperation and stability are much greater than those of conflict and
confrontation with high prices. Yet, despite all the speculations and
threat pictures, the entire North is still free of armed conflicts,
warfare and uprisings, unlike many other parts of the world. It has also
been possible to maintain joint activities of Arctic Council Working
Groups. Furthermore, there is a great deal more to gain for all parties,
in particular for the peoples and communities of the region, if we were
to go back to a situation where cooperation is a key part of the Arctic
States' foreign, security and climate policies.

The conclusions of the Geneva paper reveal that there are no real
obstacles to the Arctic States rediscovering the huge benefits of
cooperation---except a potentially catastrophic lack of the necessary
political will to do so. To avoid or minimise this danger, more research
and analysis needs to be done on the dynamics and benefits of shared
interests, as well as on cooperation as the main factor of international
relations. We need to move away from focusing research purely on the
description of challenges and speculation about potential threats.
Finally, it would be logical and sensible, at this stage, to recognize
the shared interests and special features as constructive aspects and
ingredients of Arctic geopolitics and governance. We need to analyse the
processes, as well as rethink, discuss and debate how to reaffirm
commitments to maintain peace and stability.

### Russia War\-\--No Nukes\-\--2NC

Russia won't use [nukes]{.underline}\-\--eight warrants:

#### 1. [FUNCTION]{.underline}\-\--Russia's nukes [don't]{.underline}.

1\. Do these things even work?

[[Leaving aside the **literal functionality**]{.mark} of Russia's **aged
weapons**, [are **tactical nukes** even effective]{.mark}]{.underline}?
[[They've **never been used**]{.underline}]{.mark}, so no one can be
sure. [Tactical nuclear weapons were [developed during the Cold]{.mark}
[War for warfare involving **densely massed units**]{.mark} along the
**inter-German border** where a **single warhead** might destroy
**hundreds**]{.underline} of armored-fighting-vehicles and halt a
decisive tank thrust. The war in Ukraine is a far cry from the clash
between superpowers tactical nukes were designed for.

The frontline in Ukraine is vast, with formations dispersed across miles
of open countryside. In such conditions, to significantly affect the
military balance would require the employment of large numbers of
nuclear weapons to saturate the front, something there are no
indications of the Russians considering.

Russian nuclear escalation would involve either one or a small number of
tactical nuclear weapons used primarily as a political signal. However,
[[because of]{.mark} the **[low density]{.mark}**]{.underline} of forces
in Ukraine, [there's [little to indicate]{.mark} that [tactical
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s would]{.mark} [have]{.mark} **significant
[impact]{.mark}** on the battlefield]{.underline}, and therefore have
the desired political impact.

When taken with the inherent risks and costs of nuclear use, uncertainty
regarding its benefits makes it highly unappealing. Using a nuclear
weapon is incredibly risky. That risk can only be justified by a
proportional reward. [Tactical nukes [can't]{.mark} promise to
**radically [shift]{.mark}** the battlefield [situation]{.mark} in
Russia's favor and, as a result, [can't justify]{.mark} the
**[risk]{.mark}** in using them]{.underline}.

#### 2. [EMPIRICALLY DENIED]{.underline}\-\--past great powers have [not]{.underline} used nukes, even when they're [losing]{.underline}.

2\. What makes Russia so special?

There's [[no shortage of **nuclear powers** that lost wars]{.mark},
often in a **humiliating fashion**, [to **non-nuclear states**.
When]{.mark} the [**Taliban** advanced]{.mark} on Kabul, there was
[no]{.mark} sudden **[frenzy]{.mark}**]{.underline} of speculation
[[that]{.mark} Joe [Biden]{.mark} [might use]{.mark} tactical
**[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} if faced with defeat.
[[When]{.mark} the [Americans and]{.mark} the [Chinese]{.mark} each
[failed in]{.mark} [**Vietnam**, nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s were
never]{.mark} **seriously [considered]{.mark}**[. What]{.mark}, then,
[is so **special** about **Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline} that the
potential for defeat has created a tizzy of media speculation that
nuclear use is imminent? The answer, it seems, is that many
[[people]{.mark} have [convinced]{.mark} themselves that [Russia]{.mark}
and its leadership are somehow [exempt from]{.mark} the [**basic logic**
of]{.mark} **[self-preservation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 

#### 3. [BACKLASH]{.underline}\-\--his [inner circle]{.underline} will [say no]{.underline} AND he values [regime stability]{.underline}.

3\. Who will co-sign a nuclear strike?

While Putin possesses sole nuclear authority in theory, actually
[[**using** a nuc]{.mark}lear weapon [requires]{.mark} at least the
tacit **[support]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} an **unknown number** of
individuals in the Russian [**government** and **military**. Opposing
Putin is]{.mark} a **[scary]{.mark} prospect**]{.underline}, without a
doubt-he has gone to great lengths to make sure that is the case.
[[However, if **anything** would spur]{.mark} desperate [**opposition**,
it would be]{.mark} the prospect of [**nuclear annihilation**.
Putin's]{.mark} primary [goal is **staying**]{.mark} [**in power**.
Nuclear use is **unlikely** on]{.mark} the [basis]{.mark} that he's not
going to do something [that]{.mark} gives]{.underline} a lot of
[[people]{.mark} a **good reason** to [think]{.mark} their [**survival**
might rely on **getting rid** of him]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Putin certainly appears secure in his position, with no opposition that
could credibly oppose or remove him at present. However, nuclear use is
so exceptionally dangerous that Putin cannot be sure of his security.
The [[fear of]{.mark} nuclear **[armageddon]{.mark}** could [drive
**internal**]{.mark} **[instability]{.mark}**. Both
[those]{.mark}]{.underline} in Russia actively [[seeking
**power**]{.mark} and those who would otherwise have remained
**loyal**]{.underline} to Putin, [[may decide]{.mark} that the
[**risks** of]{.mark} carrying out a **[coup]{.mark}** are [**lesser**
than]{.mark} braving the [consequences of]{.mark} **[nuclear
use]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Putin therefore has good reasons to consider
nuclear use something that weakens, rather than strengthens, his
domestic position and creates a window in which fear threatens his
regime rather than protects it.

#### 4. [INTERCEPTION]{.underline}\-\--the West would [know]{.underline} about [nuclear use]{.underline}, and would [interfere]{.underline}.

**Pfitzner '22** \[Kiran; November 11; B.A. in International Relations
from Wheaton University, M.A. Social Sciences from the University of

Ukraine,"
<https://www.deadcarl.com/p/8-reasons-why-putin-wont-use-a-nuclear>\]
nikhil

4\. Would the West allow Putin to use a nuke?

[Putin has **good reasons** to be **skeptical** that he'd be able to use
a tactical nuke **unopposed**]{.underline}. Not only does he have
internal enemies to fear, but he has [[no shortage of **foreign powers**
that]{.mark} wish him **harm** and desperately [wish]{.mark} [for
**nuc**]{.mark}**lear weapon[s]{.mark}** [not to be
use]{.mark}d]{.underline}. The extent of American signals intelligence
and human intelligence capabilities in Russia is unknown both to the
observing public and to Russian decisionmakers. However, at minimum, the
publicly available information about the extent of the intelligence
provided to the Ukrainians demonstrates that American capabilities are
substantial. [Russia has a **security problem**, which is a **poor
counterpart** to **attempting to use** nuclear weapons]{.underline}.

[Therefore, [if Russia decides to use]{.mark} a nuclear
weapon]{.underline} both Ukraine, and [the
**[West]{.mark}**]{.underline} as a whole, [[will know]{.mark} about it
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} have the opportunity to
**[[interfere]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And, of course, there are powerful
incentives to do so. The United States might well choose to destroy
whatever means the Russians intend to deliver a nuclear weapon before it
can be utilized in order to send a clear message. Ukraine has struck
nuclear capable platforms deep in Russia before .

Therefore, [Putin [must weigh]{.mark} whatever [benefits]{.mark} he
hopes to reap from nuclear use [against]{.mark} the [dangers of]{.mark}
[being **preempted**]{.mark}. This [concern should not be
**understated**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In addition to international
consequences of having attempted to use a nuclear weapon, [Putin would
face]{.underline} the **[prestige consequences]{.underline}** of having
failed to do so as well as the direct problem of the fate of the warhead
if its delivery system was destroyed. A realistic worst-case scenario
would see Putin facing a domestic crisis from Russian nationalists at
the humiliation of failed nuclear use and a nuclear weapon lost
somewhere on Russian soil.

#### 5. [DETERRENCE]{.underline}\-\--it [holds]{.underline}, even [absent]{.underline} the plan.

nikhil

5\. Would the West let Putin get away with using a nuke?

Even if Putin believes he would be able to use a nuclear weapon without
interference, [**[NATO]{.mark}** has been [**clear** what its
response]{.mark} [to]{.mark} Russian [**nuclear use** would be: an
**airpower campaign** to destroy **Russian assets**]{.mark}]{.underline}
beyond its borders to cause a collapse of the Russian army. Beyond the
question as to whether Russia can effectively deploy a nuclear weapon,
[Putin must ask the **basic strategic question**: will nuclear use
**improve** Russia's situation? If it provokes **NATO intervention** and
[leads to the **destruction** of the Russian **army**]{.mark}, the
answer]{.underline} to that question [is an emphatic
"**no**"]{.underline}. 

[[Without]{.mark} a **strong Russian [army]{.mark}**]{.underline}
backing Putin's hold on power, [[internal opportunists will be]{.mark}
both **[emboldened]{.mark}** [and have]{.mark} an **[unprecedented
opportunity]{.mark}** to move against him. Using a nuke [would mean
risking NATO]{.mark} **[destroying]{.mark}** the **security** of
[Putin's rule]{.mark}]{.underline}. From Putin's perspective, given the
deeply uncertain benefits of nuclear use, risking greater NATO
involvement is a poor tradeoff. Russian strategy towards Ukraine aims to
convince the West to disengage, which using a nuclear weapon runs
counter to. Using a nuclear weapon would draw the West deeper into the
Ukraine conflict and silence the most useful voices for Russian
interests in Western politics. [There's a [**lot** for Putin to
**fear**]{.mark} even if the use of nuclear weapons achieves all he
could hope on the battlefield]{.underline}. 

#### 6. [ESCALATION]{.underline}\-\--the [logical]{.underline} endpoint of nuclear use is [war]{.underline}, which Putin [obviously]{.underline} doesn't want.

6\. Escalating to de-escalate is just escalation

 The [[concept of "**escalating** to **de-escalate**"]{.mark} is
[reliant on]{.mark} the [**political significance** of]{.mark} nuclear
[use]{.mark}]{.underline}, hoping that using a nuclear warhead presents
a dichotomy between a negotiated settlement and nuclear war. It's a very
Clausewitzian idea, where the immense fear that surrounds nuclear
weapons is utilized to try to end hostilities. This is one theory for
how Putin might respond to conventional retaliation by NATO,
particularly if the Russian army is collapsing.

[[From **Putin's perspective**]{.underline}]{.mark}, however,
[[escalation doesn't seem]{.mark} particularly **[promising]{.mark}**.
His primary **adversary**, the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, [[with its significant **intelligence
capabilities** and]{.mark} long history of **[counterforce]{.mark}
[preparations]{.mark}**, might [carry out]{.mark} a **[preemptive
strike]{.mark}**]{.underline} if it believes Russia plans to escalate.
The US, using airpower, cyber, and electronic warfare could decapitate
Russian leadership, [[destroy]{.mark} the **[chain of command]{.mark}**
and [launch]{.mark} a **nuclear [strike]{.mark}**]{.underline} against
Russian nuclear assets. Such a course of action would be immeasurably
risky and outright unwise. While this may be unlikely, just as we do not
fully put our fears to rest on the basis that Putin is a rational actor,
Putin can no more put his own fears of American irrationality out of
mind. The United States maintains such a capability and the correct
combination of misperceptions and coincidences could make such a gamble
appear the only option.

7\. Introducing nukes means losing control.

As Clausewitz tells us, war is simple, but [even the simplest thing is
difficult. Innumerable sources of **[friction]{.mark}** affect
**[everything]{.mark}**. As one might expect, [launching a **nuclear
strike**]{.mark} is [**not exempt** from this]{.mark}]{.underline}. To
choose to use a nuclear weapon would [[mean assuming a **fundamentally
unknowable** risk]{.underline}]{.mark}. There is [no [shortage of
**accidents**]{.mark} in war, to [introduce nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s

8\. Nukes are scary for everyone.

That means everyone. Including Putin. [**No one knows** what will happen
if Putin orders the use of tactical nuclear weapons]{.underline}, only
that everything, including nuclear war, is possible. [That alone makes
it **extremely unlikely** they will be used]{.underline}. Given the
nature of many of the outcomes, that uncertainty means [[Putin would
have to **bet his life**]{.mark} to use one]{.underline}.

Even if none of these scenarios are particularly likely, let alone
nuclear armageddon, each represents a clear path to the ruin of the
Putin regime. That [[means nuclear use increases]{.mark} the [**danger**
to **Putin personally**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Most importantly, [nuclear
[use constitutes a]{.mark} [**greater risk** than a
**defeat**]{.mark}]{.underline} in Ukraine. If Putin is forced to bet
his life on a course of action, [there's **no reason** on Earth to
imagine that he believes that the consequences of **nuclear use** are
**safer** than the consequences of **losing**]{.underline} in Ukraine.
The unfortunate fact that even a total Ukrainian victory is unlikely to
result in Putin's downfall, provides the more encouraging fact that
[[Putin still has **far too much** to **lose**]{.mark} to **seriously
consider** nuclear use]{.underline}. 

To reiterate: we have every reason to believe that Putin will accept a
defeat in Ukraine before he would use a nuclear weapon. [Defeat in
Ukraine would mean predictable **domestic threats**, for which Putin has
developed a **sophisticated defense**]{.underline}. To use even a small
warhead would be a leap in the dark. The more devastating a potential
outcome is, the less likely it has to be to deter someone. [[Even a
**small chance**]{.mark} of escalation to nuclear war [is an
**overwhelming reason** to avoid]{.mark} setting down the
path]{.underline}. Putin is nowhere near desperate enough to seriously
consider taking that bet.

"JUST IN: China, Russia Increase Arctic Cooperation, But Distrust
Presents Roadblocks, Report Says,'

[[China and Russia are in a phase of "**high distrust**"]{.mark} with
each other, especially in the **military sphere**]{.underline}, but
"they can still play the cooperation card because it fits their interest
in the short term," Boulègue said.

Joint aviation patrols and strategic bomber flights have occurred since
2019 over the East China Sea and Sea of Japan --- close to Japanese and
South Korean air defense identification zones. These flyovers have often
led to airspace violations and incursions over Japan and South Korea.

And although it did not violate U.S. airspace, Moscow and Beijing held
their first joint strategic bomber patrol near the Alaskan air defense
identification zone in July 2024, the report noted.

On the maritime front, the two nations also complete drills and patrols
in the North Pacific Ocean, not far from Arctic waters. For example,
Russian and Chinese warships sail near the Aleutian Islands by Alaska,
"off the U.S. exclusive economic zone in the Bering Sea, during a highly
visible yearly joint exercise focusing on naval coordination and
anti-submarine warfare," the report said.

In April 2023, the Russian Federal Security Service Border Service and
the Chinese Coast Guard signed a memorandum of understanding "to
strengthen soft security cooperation in maritime law enforcement,"
aiming to collaboratively prevent illegal migration, smuggling, fishing
and terrorism, the report said. The agreement is not Arctic-specific,
but it resulted in the first joint coast guard exercise in the Russian
Arctic in September 2024.

"Such an agreement could represent a blueprint for future cooperation in
military affairs between the Russian Pacific Fleet and China's People's
Liberation Army Navy," the report said.

Looking ahead, it is likely that China and Russia will soon organize
another joint military drill in the Bering Sea or the Chukchi Sea ---
which are located side-by-side in the Northern Pacific Ocean and the
Arctic Ocean, respectively --- representing "a major symbolic win for
both countries," drawing international attention and proving that China
is capable of sustaining a naval force in the region, the report said.

However, Boulègue noted that [[all these events are "**joint**" --- not
**integrated**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

"[[What **really matters**]{.mark} from a **military
perspective**]{.underline} and a defense perspective [[is]{.mark} the
**[integration]{.mark}** into a single, **unified** military
command]{.underline}, into a form of military reciprocity," Boulègue
said. "[[We see **rounds** in the **water**]{.mark} with boats. We see
[**overflights**. But]{.mark} we [don\'t]{.mark} really [see
**integration**]{.mark}]{.underline}."

Beyond coordinated drills, "the disruption of critical undersea
infrastructure and seabed warfare activities represents another form of
nefarious relations that Russia and China might further in the Arctic,"
the report said.

Disrupting critical undersea infrastructure --- such as energy pipelines
and fiber optic communication cables --- is a low-cost strategy with a
high-impact effect on U.S. and NATO interests, "especially in case of
regional escalation," the report said. Additionally, the Arctic region
is particularly vulnerable to these types of infrastructure attacks due
to "chokepoints" such as the Bering Strait where redundancy and
resilience are lacking.

China and Russia both possess the ability to gather intelligence and
sabotage infrastructure, and both have a track record of doing so
previously, the report noted.

For example, an incident in October 2023 "undoubtedly showed signs of
collusion between Russia and China in \[critical undersea
infrastructure\] disruption" when the Balticconnector gas pipeline and
several fiber optic cables between Estonia, Finland and Sweden were
affected by manmade activity. The police investigation attributed the
damage to a Chinese ship, which --- upon fleeing the Baltic Sea --- was
given permission and escort to cross Russia's Northern Sea Route, the
report said.

In light of China and Russia's increased cooperation, the United States
and its allies should work on being "a bit more present with eyes and
ears" in the Arctic, using intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance
capabilities to deepen their understanding of how to operate militarily
in that environment, Boulègue said.

"Once we know more, we'll be able to push back effectively against the
messaging of cooperation," Boulègue said.

At the end of the day, Russia portrays itself "as the gatekeeper to
China's access to Arctic waters" and does not want to see a greater
presence of China's armed forces in the region, leaving Beijing cautious
to conduct independent military activity in the region, the report said.

[But [if Beijing becomes **more active**]{.mark} "in shaping future
**Arctic governance**" by continuing to push "for its
vision]{.underline} of a first come, first served 'global commons'
tailored to Chinese economic interests," [[tensions are likely to
**intensify**]{.mark} [with **Moscow**]{.mark}]{.underline}, the report
said.

"Ultimately, [both countries are **voluntarily** choosing to **ignore**
existing **friction points**]{.underline}, for fear that addressing them
would sour the relationship in the Arctic," the report said. "[However,
the [situation does not **bode well** for the]{.mark}
**[future]{.mark}** and will likely [preclude **further
cooperation**]{.mark}]{.underline}."

3.2.2.1 Closer Ties Amid Political Mistrust [With the]{.underline}
subsequent [deterioration of Russia's]{.underline} political [relations
with the West]{.underline} in 2014, the U.S. foreign policy posture
aimed at containing both Chinese and Russian power projections as well
as the situation of NASA (prohibited from cooperating with both China as
a result of the Wolf amendment and Russia, following the 2014 sanctions
over the latter's annexation of the Crimean Peninsula), [cooperation
between the two countries has in a sense become a forced
choice]{.underline} (Aliberti, 2015). Remarkably, few weeks after the
suspension of cooperation by NASA and the announcement that Russia was
not interested in expanding the operations of the ISS beyond 2020,
[[Russia started to trumpet]{.mark} a future of closer [ties
with]{.mark} the [Chinese]{.mark} partner]{.underline}. To illustrate,
during a roundtable discussion held at the First Russia-China Expo in
Harbin on 30 June 2014, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin
stressed: "If we talk about manned space flights and exploration of
outer space, as well as joint exploration of the Solar
System---primarily it is the Moon and Mars---we are ready to go forth
with our Chinese friends, hand in hand" (LaRouche Pac, 2014).
[Notwithstanding this]{.underline} clear [**statement of interest** and
**diplomatic niceties**]{.underline} contained in the speech of Dmitry
Rogozin, [the [prospects of]{.mark} closer Russia-China [relations
were]{.mark}]{.underline}---at least initially---[used as [a
**bargaining chip** to show the West]{.mark} possible [fallouts
of]{.mark} their [isolation]{.mark} policies, [rather than]{.mark} a
**[genuine]{.mark} desire** to engage with the Chinese
partner]{.underline}. Indeed, [traditionally [Russia has been]{.mark}
visibly **[reluctant]{.mark}** to talk openly about]{.underline} its
[cooperation with China]{.underline} and has always visualised the
bilateral relations under its leadership. It is for instance remarkable
that while the Chinese received training at Star City to become
taikonauts, [no Chinese ever flew with the Russians as
"passenger"]{.underline}, and vice versa (Mathieu, 2008). **[[Imperial
mind-sets are]{.mark} after all [hard to let go]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[More broadly, when looking at the Russian approach to cooperation with
its neighbour, [a key caveat is]{.mark} their **[mutual]{.mark}
historical [mistrust]{.mark}**. Indeed, the Chinese- Russian
relationship has been in fact "**bedevilled** by **pervasive mistrust**,
[rooted in **historical grievances**]{.mark}, **geopolitical
[competition]{.mark}** [and **structural factors**]{.mark}"]{.underline}
(Kotkin, 2009). Chinese officials are well aware of the so-called
"China-threat theory" that is deeply rooted among both the general
public and Russia's elites and harks all the way back to the Tsarist
Empire. In addition, [Russia appears extremely wary of Beijing's
rising]{.underline} economic and political [influence]{.underline}
within the international system (Medeiros, 2009). [China, in return, has
long seen Russia as its voracious neighbour]{.underline}, witness
Russia's part in China's century of shame and Mao's statements on
Chinese readiness to let hundreds of millions die if necessary to defend
the country against Soviet aggression. Admittedly, at present
Sino-Russian relations look to be the most stable bilateral relationship
maintained by Russia.15 The two countries are engaged in an all
dimensional, multi-tiered and wide-ranging cooperation that also extends
to military to- military cooperation and is substantiated in the
Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).16 While trade relations do not
play an important role in the current Sino-Russian
interplay---especially when compared to China's profound economic
interdependence with the U.S. and Europe---Russia remains an
indispensable source of energy supply (in particular oil and natural
gas) for Beijing (Aliberti, 2015). This does not however mean that
Russia has more bargaining chips than China. Quite to the contrary, the
partnership is inherently "asymmetric", and in China's favour. Stephen
Kotkin, professor of history at Princeton University, has underlined
that "China extracts considerable practical benefits in oil and weapons
from Russia. In return, Beijing has been flattering Moscow with rhetoric
about their 'strategic partnership' and coddling it by promoting the
illusion of amultipolar world. In many ways, [the [Chinese-Russian
relations]{.mark}hip]{.underline} today [[resembles]{.underline}]{.mark}
that which first emerged in the seventeenth century: [a rivalry for
influence in Central Asia alongside attempts to expand bilateral
commercial ties]{.underline}, with China in the catbird seat" (Kotkin,
2009). Also Bobo [Lo]{.underline}, a former Australian diplomat in
Moscow, has remarkably [labelled their]{.underline} strategic
[partnership [an **"axis of convenience"**]{.mark}]{.underline}
primarily pushed by the need to constrain U.S. diplomatic and military
power, [[rather than]{.mark} by any **[real will]{.mark}** to establish
a mutually complementary and cooperative relationship]{.underline} (Lo,
2008).

### Svalbard\-\--1NC

#### No escalation.

**Østhagen '18** \[Andreas; 6-19-2018; Senior Fellow at The Arctic
Institute, Senior Research Fellow at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute, PhD
in International Relations from the University of British Columbia; "How
Norway and Russia avoid Conflict over Svalbard," the Arctic Institute,
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/norway-russia-avoid-conflict-svalbard/

In 1977, Norway established a maritime Fisheries Protection Zone (FPZ)
around the Arctic Archipelago of Svalbard. [Norway avoided claiming an
outright]{.underline} Exclusive Economic Zone ([EEZ]{.underline})
[fearing it would be challenged due to]{.underline} stipulations (or
lack thereof) concerning extended maritime zones in [the Svalbard
Treaty]{.underline} from 1920.1) A dispute with Russia over the status
of the Zone arose, although the two countries quickly agreed to disagree
as long as Russian fishermen would have access to fisheries in the Zone.

In the late 1990s, Norwegian fisheries enforcement in the FPZ became
stricter, in tandem with declining fish stocks and fear of considerable
illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing in the Barents Sea.
This led the Norwegian Coast Guard to attempt to arrest Russian fishing
vessels on several occasions, resulting in reactions from Russian
fishermen, as well as officials in Murmansk and Moscow.2) In 1998, 2001,
2005, and 2011 specifically, incidents had the potential to escalate
beyond a fisheries issue.

Today, the [risk of events spiralling out of control]{.underline} in the
FPZ [remains a primary concern for both the Norwegian Coast Guard
and]{.underline} the Norwegian [Ministry of Defence.]{.underline}
Echoing these fears, in 2017 the Russian Defence Ministry deemed
Svalbard a potential area for future conflict with Norway, and in
consequence NATO.3) Given the potential volatility of events in the FPZ,
how do **[[Norway and Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** manage to **[[avoid
escalation]{.mark} in the case of a crisis]{.underline}**? Two
intertwining relationships are integral to answering this.

Interest alignment

First, [**coop**eration **can be the product of discord**]{.underline}.
In other words, states cooperate when they disagree. Sometimes
[[institutions]{.mark} are needed to [overcome]{.mark} the [self-help
tendencies]{.mark} of the international system]{.underline}. Along this
line of argumentation, [cooperation between Norway and Russia concerning
shared fish stocks, oil spill response, search and rescue, and ship
traffic management are formalised arrangements]{.underline} set up [[to
manage]{.underline}]{.mark} potential areas of
[[discord]{.underline}]{.mark}. Along the same line of argumentation,
the Barents Sea maritime boundary agreement in 2010 was a result of
interests between the two states converging sufficiently.4)

In other words, **[the [reason]{.mark} why [Norway and
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}** manage to **[[keep]{.mark} crises [from
escalating]{.mark}]{.underline}** further **[[is mutual interest
in]{.mark} preserving]{.underline}** aspects of their
[**[coop]{.mark}**eration]{.underline}; cooperation that benefits both
parties. This relates to multiple issue areas. Concerning resource
management, Russia is assumed to be satisfied with the current quota
scheme, in contrast to what might be achieved if an actual debate over
the status of the FPZ took place.5) Concerning the UNCLOS-regime,
[[both]{.mark} parties]{.underline} [[benefit from]{.mark} a [stable
legal regime]{.mark}]{.underline} in the FPZ specifically, but also [[in
the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} at large.6) And concerning national
security, [[both]{.underline}]{.mark} parties [[have]{.mark} an
[interest in **low levels of conflict**]{.mark} for fear of coercive
efforts by other actors within and outside the Barents/Arctic
region]{.underline}.7)

Most concerns regarding an 'Arctic Scramble' are misleading, as "many of
the \[untapped\] resources lie uncontested, well within the lands and
waters of the Arctic states'"11 exclusive economic zones. These
exclusive economic zones, governed by both the United Nations Convention
on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the Arctic Council,12 are essential
to the diplomatic management of territorial claims in the Arctic.
However, [**overlapping territorial claims** and **[ambiguous legal
authorities]{.mark}** pose significant [challenge]{.mark}s to continued
[**cooperative** governance]{.mark} in the region]{.underline}. The most
widely known example of this regional challenge are the ongoing
territorial boundary disputes between Russia, Denmark, and Canada over
the **[Lomonosov Ridge]{.underline}**, an underwater continental ridge
dividing the Arctic into two oceanic basins. Yet even this is being
resolved diplomatically, as most disputes over Arctic maritime
boundaries have been resolved peacefully.13 However, [[within]{.mark}
this realm of established **[i]{.mark}**nternational [law]{.mark}, where
disputes are settled through negotiation, lie [legal]{.mark}
**[ambiguities]{.mark}** which could be [**exploited** by
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Specifically, [the ambiguous legal status of **[Svalbard]{.mark}** is
one of the most concerning issues for **NATO** in the
**Arctic**]{.underline}. [Svalbard]{.underline}, a collection of
Norwegian islands located approximately 500 nautical miles off the
northern coast of Norway, [is [governed by a **legal framework**]{.mark}
that [generates]{.mark} **significant [ambiguity]{.mark}** [and
**uncertainty**]{.mark} as to which states have the legal authority to
control activities on the island]{.underline}.14 In 1920, the
**[Spitsbergen Treaty]{.underline}** [granted Norway
sovereignty]{.underline} over Svalbard, however, it [**granted** "the
**citizens** of each party to the treaty '**equal enjoyment'** and
'**equal liberty of access'** to the islands]{.underline}." 15This left
Svalbard under the authority of Norway but allowed dozens of states
unrestricted access to the archipelago and its resources. This ambiguity
in the law became apparent when former Russian Deputy Prime Minister
Dimitry Rogozin visited Svalbard in 2015. Norway had imposed a travel
ban on Rogozin following his involvement in Russia's annexation of
Crimea in 2014, making his presence undermine Norway's assertion of
control and authority over the archipelago.16

The Arctic archipelago of Svalbard is a part of Norway, but
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has [had a [long-term presence]{.mark} on
the islands [due]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the provisions of the **[Svalbard
Treaty]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Russian]{.underline}
authorities have regularly made it clear that ensuring the continuation
of this presence is a political goal. In recent years, Russia's official
rhetoric on Svalbard has sharpened, with
[[officials]{.underline}]{.mark} and politicians
[[accusing]{.underline}]{.mark} [[Norway of]{.underline}]{.mark} --
among other things -- [placing [**illegitimate** **restrictions** on
Russian activities]{.mark}]{.underline} on the archipelago and alleging
that Norway violates the Svalbard Treaty.

Although **[[criticism is nothing new]{.mark},]{.underline}** recent
critical statements have been sharper than previously. In a letter to
his Norwegian counterpart on occasion of the 100th anniversary of the
Svalbard Treaty, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov reminded Norway
of its obligation to ensure the possibility of conducting economic
activity under conditions of full equality. He expressed concern about
several specific issues, including "the unreasonable extension of nature
protection zones where economic operations are limited," and called for
bilateral consultations to lift the restrictions from the operations of
Russian organisations on the Archipelago (Embassy of the Russian
Federation in Norway, 2020). To this, Norway's Foreign Minister
commented, "Norwegian authorities can both regulate and prohibit
activity, as long as it is done without discrimination based on
nationality" (Søreide & Mæland Reference Søreide and Mæland2020).

[[In **November 2021**, Russia accused Norway]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
actions aimed at "[including]{.mark} this [territory]{.mark} [in]{.mark}

The [**[death]{.mark}** [and disablement of **hundreds of thousands of**
Russian soldiers]{.mark}, acute [**strains** in the defense
budget]{.mark} [and]{.mark} a looming [**shortage of military**
hardware]{.mark} [make]{.mark} [2025]{.mark} the [year of truth for
Moscow's armed forces.]{.mark}]{.underline}

With the full-scale war against Ukraine nearly three years-old,
[[Russia]{.mark}'s armed forces have [lost]{.mark} as many as
**[700,000]{.mark} [troops killed]{.mark}**[, injured or missing in
action]{.mark} by October last year]{.underline}. Estimates by Russian
and BBC researchers suggest at least [[400,000 are dead or too seriously
wounded]{.underline}]{.mark} to return to duty.

[[Recruitment]{.mark} has [barely]{.mark} [covered]{.mark} these
[losses]{.mark}]{.underline}, forcing Russia to use draftees to counter
Ukraine's Kursk offensive in August 2024, import troops from North
Korea, and extend the use of convicts and people under criminal
investigation.

By [[resorting]{.mark} [to]{.mark} such **[desperate]{.mark}**
**[measures]{.mark}**]{.underline}, Moscow was able to maintain combat
pressure and slowly extend its occupation of Ukrainian territory, though
its slow progress would not be considered a success when judged against
Russian military theory.

In 2025, recruitment will continue to be a significant challenge for the
Kremlin, further degrading its ability to field a modern army.

In December 2023, President Vladimir Putin claimed 490,000 contracted
soldiers had been recruited to the armed forces during the previous 12
months. A year later, he admitted the actual number for 2023 was much
lower, saying in a speech that "more than 300,000"had signed up.

This number correlates with the annual budgetary report, which detailed
approximately 330,000 one-time payments (of 195,000 rubles, or \$1,900,
each) to contracted soldiers. This also confirms an assessment of troop
sign-up published by CEPA in March 2024.

Putin announced the official number for 2024 in the same speech,
claiming 430,000 contracted soldiers had been recruited during the year.
He appears to have been exaggerating again.

Currently there is only a budgetary report for three quarters of 2024
and it suggests fewer than 230,000 were signed up between January and
September. It is very unlikely that a further 200,000 signed up between
October and December to tally with the president's boast.

A more probable assessment, which will need to be verified later in the
year, is that 60,000--70,000 joined in the last quarter, taking total
recruitment in 2024 to about 300,000 and so matching the previous year's
number. This figure would include prisoners and people under
investigation, who are eligible to join the military in exchange for
criminal charges being dropped.

Alongside a shortage of recruits, the [[Kremlin]{.mark} also
**[faces]{.mark}** the **[manpower challenge]{.mark}** caused by combat
losses.]{.underline}

There were 48,000 Russian soldiers missing in action in December 2024,
according to a recording of comments by Russia's deputy defense minister
Anna Tsivileva, and more than 50,000 inquiries from Russian citizens to
the Ukrainian authorities about missing Russian soldiers by January
2025.

These stark numbers explain why Russian authorities repeatedly increased
payments to those who signed up to fight during 2024. They also shed
light on the decision to deploy poorly trained drafted soldiers in the
Kursk region, and to bring in troops from North Korea, allowing the
Kremlin to avoid a new round of mobilization by coercion.

While the option of partial mobilization still exists, this would
probably only happen if something extraordinary occurred at the front.
Moreover, such a hypothetical scenario would have to resonate as much
with the Russian people as for the Russian authorities. And the fact is
that even Ukraine's incursion into the western Russian region of Kursk
did not trigger this response.

The continued recruitment of prisoners and people under investigation
relies on a "carrot and stick" approach where the "carrot" is money and
the promise of freedom if they sign up, and the "stick" is the threat of
brutal violence in Russia's prisons and pre-trial detention facilities
if they don't.

Considering there are more than 700,000 criminal cases in Russia every
year, and more than 500,000 convicts, a significant number of new
soldiers could hypothetically be recruited from this group in 2025.

But the Kremlin's problem is not just with the supply of sufficient
cannon fodder. The [[officer]{.mark} [corps]{.mark} is also
[**deteriorating** due to losses, **damaging the structure**, discipline
and fighting effectiveness of the Kremlin's damaged
legion]{.mark}s.]{.underline} As of January 2025, there were more than
5,400 Russian officers confirmed killed and more than half of those were
junior lieutenants, lieutenants and senior lieutenants.

The death toll implies multiple thousands of other officers have been
wounded, resulting in a significant lack of lower-level commanders, a
shortfall that cannot be quickly rectified. The consequence has been an
inevitable deterioration in organizational effectiveness.

[The challenge for [Russia's]{.mark} [military]{.mark} is not an absence
of will to fight, but a [**decreasing** **ability** for their units to
act like modern regular armed forces due to the **shortage of capable
junior officers**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The Kremlin's cannon fodder can push the Ukrainian army back and gain
more territory, but will still fall short when judged against the
benchmarks of Russian military theory, which says gaining territory
cannot be the central aim of combat.

The main task is always the defeat of an adversary's forces and to
eliminate their ability and will to keep fighting. In 2023 and 2024, the
Russian army failed to accomplish this task.

If Ukraine continues fighting, and the West continues its support, [the
[Russian army will not be able to accomplish]{.underline}]{.mark} [its
main [combat]{.mark} [task]{.mark} in 2025]{.underline} either. At the
same time, [the [growing **human** and **materiel** **losses** will
**make** the **ongoing** **deterioration** of the Russian army
**irreversible**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Taiwan\-\--1NC

#### No Taiwan war\-\--prefer [scholarly consensus]{.underline} over one-off [exaggerations]{.underline}. 

**von Sydow '24** \[Alexis von Sydow; February 23; Analyst at the
Swedish National China Centre; The Diplomat, "Most Experts Agree: China
Isn't About to Invade Taiwan"\]

Is a Chinese invasion of Taiwan tomorrow's Ukraine war? The parallels
between the two cases, where a revisionist power stands poised to pounce
on a vulnerable neighbor, make it a scenario that is now feared by many.
[Sometimes, an **[invasion of Taiwan]{.mark}** by China is even
[treated]{.mark} almost [as a **foregone conclusion**]{.mark}, a
question of "**when**" rather than "**if**.]{.underline}" Especially
within military circles, [[predictions]{.mark} of a **China-U.S. war**
over **Taiwan** in 2025 or 2027 [have become **common
currency**]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the same time, other commentators
maintain that the risk of war remains low.

How can we adjudicate such claims? One answer is by looking at available
forecasts. At the Swedish National China Centre, this is what we have
done in a new report. [For the **first time**, we have produced an
[overview of **all available forecasts**]{.mark}]{.underline} of a
possible Taiwan conflict. We find that the [results **largely
contradict** the alarmist position]{.underline}. [Forecasts
[**consistently** rate the risk]{.mark} of **armed conflict** in the
**Taiwan** Strait as **[low]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Alarmist commentators **overestimate** the risk of war]{.underline} in
at least three important ways.

First, it is often stated that China is arming itself specifically in
preparation for a Taiwan invasion. 2027 often figures as a possible date
for such an invasion, presumably because this year is an official
milestone in the Chinese military's modernization plans. But the year
[**2027 hardly figures** at all in the scholarly forecasts we have
examined]{.underline}.

Concerning China's military modernization, forecasts do point to growing
risk, but this is mainly a question of the gradually changing military
balance vis-a-vis the United States in the region. A more even military
balance inherently means growing risk, but that risk is growing from a
very low baseline probability. It is still true that [[China **cannot be
confident** to win]{.mark} a war with the U.S. over **Taiwan**, [which
keeps **down** the risk]{.mark}]{.underline} for the present.

Second, it is said that China cannot accept Taiwan's democratic
institutions, and that conflict can only be averted by the United States
and other allies stepping up explicit support for Taiwan's independence.
But forecasts instead point to the worsening China-U.S. relationship
itself as one of the major risk factors. Growing tensions over Taiwan
are a consequence of increasing great power conflict. Beijing sees
Taiwan as a part of the U.S. sphere of influence, and knows that an
attack on Taiwan is a military attack on U.S. interests. If China-U.S.
rivalry is kept within limits, China has little interest in provoking
such a conflict.

Third, a common narrative among alarmists is the story of the changing
Chinese regime. They warn us of China's increasingly aggressive posture,
its growing "assertiveness," and an alleged ideological turn away from
"openness" under the rule of Xi Jinping. By contrast, forecasters are
divided on the question of whether China's intentions concerning Taiwan
have changed in any crucial regard. Xi Jinping hews close to the
traditional Communist Party line of unquestioned sovereignty over
Taiwan, and his international ambitions are likewise inherited from his
predecessors. Most of China's new-found "assertiveness" is likely less a
matter of ideological change and more a matter of growing capabilities.
From this, one might conclude that assumptions of extreme urgency on
China's part are faulty.

These are the takeaways from available forecasts, and they stand in
stark contrast to alarmist predictions from the U.S. military and other
actors. They suggest that [**[alarmist narratives]{.mark}** are arrived
at by [look]{.mark}ing [at]{.mark} the growing [risk]{.mark} of war [in
**isolation**, without consideration of its]{.mark} general **[low
baseline probability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Alarmists also tend to
**[heavily exaggerate]{.mark}** the degree of **internal** change caused
by **[Xi]{.mark}** Jinping]{.underline}, which is a factor that appears
doubtful when aggregating forecasts.

Moreover, [even though **available [forecasts]{.mark}** rate the risk of
war as **low**, they might **[still]{.mark} be [overestimating]{.mark}**
it]{.underline}. This is because [all these forecasts are found in works
that study **military issues** and **political attitudes**]{.underline}.
[But **[other things matter]{.mark}**, too]{.underline}.
[**[Taiwan's]{.mark} crucial role** in the [**semiconductor**
industry]{.mark} is well known, and [destroying]{.mark} these **[supply
chains]{.mark}** would cost the world economy **trillions of
dollars**]{.underline} per year. On top of this comes the effects of the
economic warfare that almost certainly would result if China attacked
Taiwan. Most estimates conclude [that such consequences would [hit
**China**]{.mark} **even [harder]{.mark}** [than the
West]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is hard to imagine that China does not
realize this or refuses to take it into account when weighing the
possibility of using force. [This should **further subtract** from the
generally **low level of risk** estimated]{.underline} by the forecasts
we have reviewed.

All of this taken together suggests that a mix of military and economic
deterrence, together with a responsibly managed China-U.S. relationship,
can be expected to effectively prevent conflict even in the future. Most
importantly, [discussions of a possible [**Taiwan conflict** should
proceed from]{.mark} an understanding of the **[low]{.mark} baseline
[probability]{.mark}** of such a scenario, [not]{.mark} from
panic-driven "**[when-rather-than-if]{.mark}**" takes]{.underline}.

#### China [lacks]{.underline} capabilities AND too many [alt-causes]{.underline}. 

**Wang '23** \[Cindy; November 13; Reporter; Bloomberg, "Taiwan Doubts
China's Xi Will Have the Ability to Invade by 2027"\]

(Bloomberg) \-- Chinese President **[[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark}** Jinping
is [[**unlikely** to]{.underline}]{.mark} have the capability to
[[conduct]{.mark} a **successful** [invasion]{.mark} of **Taiwan** by
**2027**, according to]{.underline} a [top **Taiwanese security**
official, casting **doubts** on]{.underline} the progress of
[Beijing's]{.underline} military modernization [plans]{.underline}.

**[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}** will [continue to
[delay]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[P]{.underline}**eople's
**[L]{.underline}**iberation **[A]{.underline}**rmy's [[invasion]{.mark}
timetable [by **strengthening**]{.mark}]{.underline} its
[[defense]{.underline}]{.mark} capabilities, Wellington Koo, the head of
the island's National Security Council, said Monday at a briefing in
Taipei.

"[[I **don't** think it will **happen**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the near
future or at least within one to two years," Koo said of a Chinese
invasion. "If China needs to carry out amphibious landing operations to
take Taiwan, [I [**don't** think it will have]{.mark} such
**[capabilities]{.mark}** by **2027**]{.underline}."

Koo declined to pinpoint when an attack could happen, saying only that
the island that China claims as its own doesn't see Beijing making
invasion preparations. [[Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark} is already
[[facing **uncertainty**]{.underline}]{.mark} next year
[[from]{.underline}]{.mark} its own [**[econ]{.mark}omic downturn**,
while]{.underline} the [world]{.underline} must also [deal with the
**[US election]{.mark}**, and [wars in **Europe**]{.mark}
and]{.underline} the **[[Middle East]{.underline}]{.mark}**, he added.

Xi is seeking to build a "world-class force" by 2027, a deadline that
coincides with the 100th anniversary of the PLA. Mark
**[Milley]{.underline}**, then [chairman of]{.underline} the
**[J]{.underline}**oint **[C]{.underline}**hiefs of
**[S]{.underline}**taff, said last year [[Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark}'s
military [[**won't** be ready]{.mark} to invade **Taiwan**]{.underline}
for "some time." His successor, Charles Q. Brown Jr., said last week [he
**[doubts]{.mark}** Beijing [plans to try]{.mark} to take Taiwan
**[militarily]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[Taiwan]{.underline} is [separated]{.underline} from China
[by]{.underline} more than [100 miles]{.underline} (160 kilometers) of
[ocean]{.underline}, and its [rugged **[coastline]{.mark}**]{.underline}
would [[make]{.underline}]{.mark} an amphibious [[invasion
**challenging**]{.underline}]{.mark}. While [[China]{.underline}]{.mark}
has the world's largest [[navy]{.underline}]{.mark} by number of
warships, its forces are **[largely [untested]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Koo said [[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark} would use mobile weapons such as
[[**anti-ship** missiles]{.underline}]{.mark}, Himars [[rocket]{.mark}
systems, [drones]{.mark} and]{.underline} Javelin [[anti-tank]{.mark}
systems]{.underline} to [[make]{.mark} China's]{.underline} landing
[operations]{.underline} more **[[difficult]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
the event of an invasion. The US will bring forward a Himars shipment by
one year to 2026.

[[Fears]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[China]{.mark} will]{.underline} soon
[[**invade** Taiwan]{.mark} are **[overblown]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[There is **[little evidence]{.mark}**]{.underline} that
[[Chinese]{.mark} leaders [see]{.mark} a **closing** [window for
**action**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Such [fears]{.underline} appear to be
[driven]{.underline} more [by Washington's assessments of]{.underline}
its [**own** military **vulnerabilities**]{.underline} than by Beijing's
risk-reward calculus. Historically, [Chinese leaders]{.underline} have
[**not** started wars to **divert** attention from [**domestic**
challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}, and they continue to favor using
measures short of conflict to achieve their objectives. If anything,
[problems at **home**]{.underline} have [[**moderated** Chinese
fo]{.mark}reign [po]{.mark}licy]{.underline}, and Chinese popular
opinion has tended to reward government bluster and displays of resolve
that do not lead to open conflict.

If [West]{.underline}ern policymakers **[exaggerate]{.underline}** the
[risk of]{.underline} a [Chinese invasion]{.underline} of Taiwan, [they
might]{.underline} inadvertently [create a **self-fulfilling
prophecy**]{.underline}. Instead of worrying that Beijing will gin up a
foreign crisis to bolster its standing at home or assuming that Beijing
feels pressured to invade in the near term, the United States should
focus on arresting---or at least decelerating---the action-reaction
spiral that has steadily ratcheted up tensions and made a crisis more
likely. That does not mean halting efforts to bolster Taiwan's
resilience to Chinese coercion or to diversify the United States'
defense posture in the region. But it does mean avoiding needless
confrontation and identifying reciprocal steps that Washington and
Beijing could take to lower the temperature.

The hard but crucial task for [U.S.]{.underline} policymakers is to
[thread]{.underline} the [needle between **deterrence** and
**provocation**]{.underline}. Symbolic displays of resolve,
unconditional commitments to defend Taiwan, and pledges of a surge in
U.S. military power in the region could stray too far toward the latter,
inadvertently provoking the very conflict U.S. policymakers seek to
deter.

WAG THE DOG?

Although the logic of [**diversionary** aggression]{.underline} has an
intuitive appeal, there is [**little reason** to think]{.underline} that
[domestic challenges]{.underline} will [**tempt** China's leadership to
launch a war]{.underline} abroad. In a 2008 review of cross-national
studies of international conflict, the scholars Matthew Baum and Philip
Potter found [**little consistent evidence** of world leaders
starting]{.underline} military [hostilities to whip up **domestic**
support]{.underline}. Moreover, [**[authoritarian]{.mark}**
leaders]{.underline} may be **[[less likely]{.underline}]{.mark}** than
democratic ones [[to initiate crises in]{.underline}]{.mark} the wake of
[domestic **[unrest]{.mark}**]{.underline} because they have greater
latitude to repress their people, the political scientist Chris Gelpi
has found. And rather than embark on risky military adventures, [leaders
facing **domestic** challenges]{.underline} often [[choose **other**
means to **quell discontent**]{.underline}]{.mark}, including working
with other states to address threats from within---for instance, by
settling border disputes to calm unrest on their frontiers---or
resorting to repression.

China's response to once-in-a-generation protests against its draconian
COVID-19 restrictions late last year is a case in point. After
demonstrators took to the streets in dozens of cities carrying sheets of
blank paper---symbols of resistance in the face of censorship---the
Chinese government did not seek to deflect attention from domestic
discontent with aggressive foreign policy measures. Instead, it eased
its COVID-19 restrictions, detained and interrogated protesters, and
continued its post-pandemic efforts to reassure foreign investors.

[[Chinese]{.mark} leaders]{.underline} have [[given **few**
signs]{.underline}]{.mark} that **[domestic insecurity]{.underline}**
might [prompt]{.underline} them to [**lash out** against
Taiwan]{.underline}. On the contrary, [**[Xi]{.mark}** and]{.underline}
the [**[C]{.mark}**hinese **[C]{.mark}**ommunist
**[P]{.mark}**arty]{.underline} leadership have [[**sought** to
project]{.underline}]{.mark} an [image of [**confidence** and
**patience**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the face of growing international
risks and challenges. Despite pessimism in China about trends in public
opinion that show Taiwan pulling away from the mainland politically and
culturally, Xi told the CCP's 20th Party Congress in October 2022 that
"the wheels of history are rolling on toward China's reunification."

Xi has sought to project an image of confidence and patience.

Historically, [Chinese leaders]{.underline} have tended to
**[temper]{.underline}** their [foreign policy during times of
**domestic turmoil**]{.underline}. Sometimes, [they have [engaged in
**harsh**]{.mark} rhetoric and [**saber rattling**,
but]{.mark}]{.underline} they have only [**rarely** launched military
operations]{.underline} in such periods. [Even Chairman **Mao**
Zedong]{.underline}, who ordered the shelling of offshore islands in
1958, [sought to mobilize the Chinese population while
**[avoid]{.mark}ing** an **[outright war]{.mark}** over Taiwan, warning
that [China]{.mark} must [**only** fight battles it is **sure** of
winning]{.mark}]{.underline}.

According to the political scientist M. Taylor Fravel, China has
compromised in 15 of the 17 territorial disputes it has settled with its
neighbors since 1949---most of them during periods of regime insecurity
arising from domestic political challenges, including unrest in Tibet
and Xinjiang in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Tiananmen Square
protests in 1989, and renewed unrest in Xinjiang in the early 1990s. In
an analysis of Beijing's behavior in militarized interstate disputes
between 1949 and 1992, moreover, the political scientist Alastair Iain
Johnston found "[**no relationship** between **domestic unrest** and
China's **use of force** externally]{.underline}." If anything, the
frequency of [China's involvement in militarized interstate disputes
**declined** when domestic unrest **increased**]{.underline}. On the
whole, in other words, [Chinese leaders have done the
**opposite**]{.underline} of what many analysts are warning: they have
sought to reduce external tensions in order to tackle domestic
challenges from a position of greater strength while attempting to deter
foreign efforts to exploit internal tensions.

Beijing's behavior in the East and South China Seas has followed this
pattern. During two flare-ups with Tokyo in the 1990s over the island
chain known as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China, for
instance, Chinese leaders quashed expressions of popular antipathy
toward Japan with the aim of preserving economic ties with Tokyo,
according to the international relations scholars Phillip Saunders and
Erica Downs. And the political scientist Andrew Chubb has shown that
between 1970 and 2015, Chinese leaders tended to be less aggressive at
sea during periods of internal strife. When Beijing did act assertively
in these maritime territorial disputes, it did so mainly to thwart
perceived challenges with new capabilities, not to distract from
heightened domestic insecurity.

BARK NOT BITE

Claims that Beijing is looking for opportunities to lash out for
domestic political purposes aren't just wrong. They are dangerous
because they imply that U.S. actions have no bearing on China's calculus
on Taiwan and that the only way to deter Beijing from diversionary
aggression is to deny it the ability to prevail in such an endeavor.

Domestic considerations and the military balance of power are not the
only factors Xi will weigh when deciding whether to attack Taiwan. Even
if he prefers to avoid a near-term conflict and believes that China's
military prospects will improve over time, he might still order a
military operation if he and other Chinese leaders perceive a sharp
increase in the risk that Taiwan could be lost. As Fravel has shown,
China has often used military force to counter perceived challenges to
its sovereignty claims in territorial and maritime disputes.

Such challenges, including U.S. actions that endorse Taiwan as an
independent state or suggest that Washington might be on the cusp of
restoring a formal alliance with the island, might trigger such a
reaction from China. Even so, Beijing has less risky ways to respond to
perceived provocations, including rhetoric and actions that could
burnish its nationalist credentials without escalating to military
conflict. As I have previously argued in Foreign Affairs, China's
leaders frequently engage in rhetorical bluster to appease domestic
audiences and minimize the popular costs of not using military force.
They may also choose from a variety of escalatory measures short of war
to signal resolve and impose costs on Taiwan, including military,
economic, and diplomatic efforts to squeeze the island and deter it from
pulling away from the mainland. Behavior of this sort should not be
mistaken for preparations for war.

KEEP CALM

In any society, there are people who go looking for a fight. But among
the ranks of China's top leaders, those people still appear to be less
influential than those who recognize that it is better to win without
fighting. Although Xi warned in 2021 that China would take "decisive
measures" if provoked by "forces for Taiwan independence," the [[CCP
**reiterated**]{.underline}]{.mark} in 2022 that ["**[peaceful
reunification]{.mark}**" remains its "**first choice**."]{.underline}
[[Even]{.mark} the **[hawkish]{.mark}** Qiao Liang, a retired **[major
general]{.mark}** in the Chinese air force, has [**cautioned**
against]{.mark} the tide of **[nationalist agitation]{.mark}** for
action against Taiwan]{.underline}. "China's ultimate goal is not the
reunification of Taiwan, but to achieve the dream of national
rejuvenation---so that all 1.4 billion Chinese can have a good life,"
Qiao said in a May 2020 interview. He went on to warn that taking
[[Taiwan by force]{.mark} would be "**[too costly]{.mark}**" and should
**not** be Beijing's **top** priority]{.underline}.

At present, Chinese leaders are still pressing the PLA to prepare for a
possible war over Taiwan, which indicates that they are uncertain about
their ability to win. So long as these doubts linger, the use of force
to take the island will remain an option of last resort. These leaders
cannot count on a swift victory to bolster their domestic popularity,
and there is no evidence that they are preparing for an imminent
invasion. As John Culver, a former U.S. intelligence analyst focused on
East Asia, has noted, preparing to seize Taiwan would be an enormous,
highly visible effort. In the months before an invasion, such
preparations would be impossible to keep secret.

For now, the best way to prevent a showdown is to recognize that mutual
efforts to show resolve and threaten punishment are not enough to keep
the peace. China, Taiwan, and the United States must resist analysis
that could turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy and make sure that
alternatives to conflict remain viable.

To that end, Washington should assure Beijing that it is not bent on
promoting Taiwan's permanent separation or formal independence from
China. U.S. officials and representatives should not refer to Taiwan as
a country, ally, or strategic asset, or attempt to sow discord or
encourage regime change in China, which would provoke rather than deter
Beijing. Washington should help bolster Taiwan's defenses, but it should
do so without signaling dramatic changes in U.S. military support, which
risk inadvertently creating the impression that Beijing has a limited
window to invade. Beijing, Washington, and Taipei must avoid creating
the very do-or-die scenario that they fear.

#### Invasion is [impossible]{.underline}\-\--geography, capabilities, AND time [deter]{.underline} attempts.

**Sacks '24** \[David; January 10; fellow for Asia studies at the
Council on Foreign Relations, M.A. in International Relations and
International Economics, with honors, from the Johns Hopkins School of
Advanced International Studies; "Why China Would Struggle to Invade
Taiwan"\]

[To **invade** Taiwan, China]{.underline} would [have to
conduct]{.underline} an [**extraordinarily complex** military operation,
**synchronizing air**, **land**, and **sea** power as well as
**electronic** and **cyber**warfare.]{.underline}

The [[Taiwan Strait]{.underline}]{.mark}, over ninety miles wide, [is
**incredibly [choppy]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and [due to two
**[monsoon]{.mark}** seasons [and]{.mark} other **[extreme
weather]{.mark}** events]{.underline}, a [seaborne invasion]{.underline}
is [**only** viable a **few** months]{.underline} out of the year.

[[Transporting]{.underline}]{.mark} hundreds of thousands of
[[soldiers]{.underline}]{.mark} across the Taiwan Strait would [[take
**weeks**]{.mark} and [require **thousands** of
ships]{.mark}]{.underline}. Each [crossing]{.underline} would [[take
**hours**]{.mark}, allowing Taiwan to **target** the ships, **mass
troops** on]{.underline} potential [landing sites]{.underline}, and
[erect **barriers**]{.underline}.

[China]{.underline} would [need to **shift** military assets
to]{.underline} its [eastern coast]{.underline} and undertake other
visible preparations for an invasion, which [**Taiwan** and the
**U**nited **S**tates]{.underline} would likely be [able to
**detect**]{.underline}.

Some questions remains about whether China has the naval vessels it
would need to invade Taiwan successfully. [[China's]{.underline}]{.mark}
amphibious [[fleet]{.underline}]{.mark} is [relatively
**[small]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and although [Beijing]{.underline} will
likely [turn]{.underline} to [**civilian** ships to sustain and
supplement]{.underline} an invading force, [those take
**longer**]{.underline} to unload and would be [**more vulnerable** to
Taiwanese missiles.]{.underline}

[Even if Chinese troops successfully cross]{.underline} the strait,
**[[few]{.underline}]{.mark}** deep-water [[ports]{.underline}]{.mark}
and beaches in Taiwan [[could **accommodate**]{.underline}]{.mark} a
large landing [force]{.underline}.

[Beijing]{.underline} would also have to [assume [Taiwan]{.mark} could
**[destroy]{.mark}**]{.underline} its major [[ports]{.mark} at a
conflict's outset [to **prevent**]{.mark}]{.underline} an
[[invader]{.mark} from **[using]{.mark}** them]{.underline}.

[Taiwan's **[west coast]{.mark}** has [**shallow**
waters]{.mark}]{.underline} extending from most of its beaches, meaning
they are [**not ideal** for]{.underline} an [invading
force]{.underline}.

[Taiwan's **[east coast]{.mark}**]{.underline} is [lined by
**[cliffs]{.mark}**]{.underline} that are [**[too steep]{.mark}** for an
invading force [to scale]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moving to Taiwan's major
population centers is only possible via a few narrow passes and tunnels,
which Taiwan can destroy or defend.

The **[D-Day]{.underline}** operation [in **W**orld **W**ar
**II**]{.underline} was the **[largest]{.underline}** amphibious
[invasion in military history]{.underline}, involving seven thousand
ships and almost two hundred thousand troops who crossed the nearly
one-hundred-mile English Channel. [Over a period of **three-plus
weeks**]{.underline}, 850,000 troops landed on the beaches of Normandy
to liberate France. A [Chinese]{.underline} amphibious
**[[invasion]{.underline}]{.mark}** of Taiwan would [[likely]{.mark}
have to [dwarf **D-Day** in **scale**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Due to]{.underline} the [[**shallow** water, China]{.underline}]{.mark}
would [have to [anchor ships **far** from]{.mark} Taiwan's
[coast]{.mark}]{.underline} and move equipment to the shores slowly,
[[making]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[ships
**vulnerable**]{.underline}]{.mark} to Taiwanese missiles and artillery.

[Taiwan has]{.underline} also invested in defenses, from
**[mines]{.underline}** to [**anti-landing spikes**, and]{.underline}
mobile **[missile launchers]{.underline}**.

[Despite]{.underline} China's rapid military [modernization]{.underline}
and its focus on preparing for military scenarios in the Taiwan Strait,
[Taiwan has **[inherent]{.mark}**]{.underline} defensive
**[[advantages]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [China]{.underline} will
[find [**difficult** to overcome]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Even if [[China]{.mark}'s military]{.underline} successfully established
a beachhead on Taiwan, it would [[**struggle** to
navigate]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[mountain]{.mark}ous
terrain]{.underline}** to secure the island.

[Taiwan's military]{.underline}, by contrast, [has]{.underline} the
[advantage of **knowing the land**]{.underline} and terrain and how to
defend it.

[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark} has [mountain peaks reaching over **twelve
thousand feet**]{.underline}. Taiwanese [[troops]{.mark} could
[hide]{.mark} in]{.underline} those [mountains [and
wage]{.mark}]{.underline} a **[[guerrilla warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}**
campaign.

[Traversing]{.underline} those [mountains]{.underline} to move inland
would be [**challenging**, rendering Taiwan's east coast far less useful
and forcing]{.underline} invaders to focus on [attacking the island's
west coast]{.underline}. In addition, although Taiwan has major ports
located in the south, moving to the north is also hard because there are
few major roadways and many river crossings. As a result, a Chinese
invasion would likely have to focus squarely on the ports and beaches
located near Taipei.

Strategic Chokepoints

[With few]{.underline} viable beaches and [ports to choose
from]{.underline} and the difficulty of moving forces across the island,
China's [concentration]{.underline} would [turn to **Taiwan's
capital**]{.underline} region, home to over one-fourth of its
population. [China's]{.underline} military [would seek to seize
**control** of **Taipei**]{.underline} and depose Taiwan's government.

Driven by the political objective of establishing full control over
Taiwan, China would need to seize control of Taiwan's capital of Taipei.

However, [gaining [control]{.mark} of [Taipei]{.mark}]{.underline} to
establish full control over Taiwan would be **[[enormously
difficult]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [**Few routes** lead into]{.underline}
the [city]{.underline}, which sits in a bowl, ringed by mountains that
defenders can utilize to target an invading force.

To prevent China's military from seizing the capital, [Taiwan can choose
to **destroy**]{.underline} the [city's **major port**]{.underline} and
the [**tunnels** and **highways**]{.underline} leading into the city.

[Even if China's military entered Taipei, it would have to
consider]{.underline} conducting **[urban warfare]{.underline}**.

Costly Urban Warfare

Given the island's terrain, most of Taiwan's twenty-three million people
live in a handful of cities, with seven million residing in Taipei.

To conquer Taiwan, [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} would therefore be
[[force]{.mark}d into **[urban combat]{.mark}**]{.underline}, fighting
street by street.

That [approach would [mean]{.mark}]{.underline} a [**[slow]{.mark}**,
**[costly invasion]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Taiwan]{.underline} has inherent [advantages]{.underline} that will
[make]{.underline} an [invasion **difficult**, **expensive**, and
**uncertain**]{.underline}. Still, the Taiwanese people's will to fight
and resist will likely prove more decisive than mountains, ports, roads,
or the ocean. If China conducts the operation with little opposition, it
can probably navigate and overcome those obstacles. However, if
confronted with millions of people determined to repel an invasion,
China will face a much tougher task.

#### No [Taiwan war]{.underline}\-\--[zero]{.underline} will or capability. 

**Ullman '22** \[Harlan; February 22; Senior Advisor at the Atlantic
Council; Atlantic Council, "Reality Check #10: China will not invade
Taiwan"\]

Some observers believe that how the United States handles the Ukraine
crisis will be closely watched by China. That is true. But, as this
paper argues, the [**[Ukraine]{.mark} crisis** [will not influence
Chinese]{.mark} decisions]{.underline} on whether or not to launch a
full-scale amphibious invasion [because]{.underline}, given the force
demands, [[China]{.mark} simply [lacks]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[**[capacity]{.mark}** to do so]{.underline} for the foreseeable future.

The current and former heads of Indo-Pacific
[[Command]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[warned about]{.mark}
China]{.underline}'s **[[building]{.underline}]{.mark}** the necessary
[**[forces]{.mark}** to invade]{.underline} and conquer
[Taiwan]{.underline}, possibly by decade's end. Given China's
long-standing determination to make Taiwan part of the mainland and
achieve "one China," a military takeover of Taiwan sounds plausible

[**However**, this notion is based on]{.underline} a [**fundamental
misperception** regarding China's capability to launch]{.underline} a
[major]{.underline} amphibious [assault]{.underline}. If China were to
launch such a military attack on Taiwan, [what would that take
in]{.underline} terms of [**forces** and **force levels**? Does China
possess]{.underline} the [requisite numbers and
capabilities?]{.underline} If not, when, if at all, might it build those
forces that, if history counts, would number in the hundreds of
thousands of troops and thousands of ships and maritime assault
vehicles? Current and past studies do not successfully or specifically
address these questions. These studies focus on the how, but not on the
specific manpower requirements of what would be required to carry out an
invasion.

The definitive document on what size force would be required to seize
Taiwan in a full-out landing was drafted by the US military in the late
stages of World War II in the Pacific. In 1944, Operation Causeway was
the US plan for retaking Formosa, as it was then called, from 30,000
starving Japanese soldiers. The planned invasion force was double the
size of Operation Overlord, the Normandy landing: 400,000 soldiers and
marines deployed on 4,000 ships. With a potential defending force of
450,000 Taiwanese today, using the traditional three-to-one ratio of
attackers to defenders taught at war colleges, China would need to
deploy over 1.2 million soldiers (out of a total active force of over 2
million). Many thousands of ships would be required to land all those
forces, and doing so would take weeks. How many occupation forces would
be required to pacify the Taiwanese? Surely the lessons of Afghanistan
and Iraq are not lost on the PLA leadership.

[[China possesses]{.underline}]{.mark} a [**small [fraction]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark}]{.underline} the [necessary [ships to
execute]{.mark}]{.underline} a [[landing]{.underline}]{.mark} of that
size [and **lacks the capacity** to do so]{.underline} for the
foreseeable future. [[Nor are there **any**]{.mark} **current
[plans]{.mark}** [suggesting China is]{.mark} intent on
[procuring]{.mark} such a [force]{.mark}]{.underline}, though that could
change.

Further, [[Taiwan]{.mark} is [not conducive to]{.mark}]{.underline} any
form of amphibious **[[assault]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A [[handful
of]{.mark} landing [sites]{.mark}]{.underline} on the west coast [are
[blocked by]{.mark}]{.underline} proximate
**[[mountain]{.mark}ou[s]{.mark} areas]{.underline}** running the length
of the 250-mile-long island, some [approaching **10,000 feet** in
height. [Defenders]{.mark} could fall back]{.underline} using this
difficult terrain [to [wage]{.mark} a **[guerrilla
war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Moreover, [[Taiwan lacks]{.mark} the
**[infra]{.mark}structure** [to support]{.mark}]{.underline} over a
million [[invaders]{.mark} and]{.underline} their [logistical
needs]{.underline}, most of which would have to come from the mainland.

#### Any aggression is [antithetical]{.underline} to CCP goals. 

**Kapadia '22** \[Reshma; March 1; associate editor at Barron\'s;
Barron's, "Why China Is Unlikely to Escalate Any Conflict with Taiwan
Right Now"\]

Russia's invasion of [Ukraine]{.underline} has [put]{.underline} its
friend [China in a **difficult position**]{.underline} on multiple
fronts. For starters, [one of China's **core**]{.underline} foreign
policy [**tenets** is that sovereignty is
**sacrosanct**]{.underline}---a principle that underpins its contention
that the U.S. should not be meddling in matters related to Hong Kong,
Taiwan, or even Xinjiang. As a result, [[Russia's
attack]{.underline}]{.mark} on Ukraine and recognition of breakaway
areas **[[complicates]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [[situation]{.mark} for
China]{.underline}---likely a reason China advocated for the latest
Ukraine-Russia talks, according to Eurasia Group Founder Ian Bremmer.

The other is this: [[China's **priority**]{.underline}]{.mark} this year
[[was **stability**]{.underline}]{.mark} ahead of the 20th Party
Congress [when [Xi]{.mark}]{.underline} Jinping [is [expected to
take]{.mark} a [**third term**. Policy makers]{.mark} were]{.underline}
already [[grappling with]{.mark} an **[economy]{.mark} slowing** from
last year's [**crackdowns** on tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology [and
property]{.underline} sectors, [and strict **[Covid]{.mark}
restrictions**]{.underline} as Omicron hits major cities in China.
[Getting pulled into a **war**]{.underline} and into an increasingly
fractious situation [with]{.underline} its primary rival, [the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, [wasn't on the
agenda]{.underline}.

"[[China]{.mark} clearly **[doesn't want]{.mark}**]{.underline} a Cold
War and isn't going [to **opportunistically** use this to go after
**[Taiwan]{.mark}**]{.underline}," Eurasia's Bremmer said in a briefing
with reporters on Monday. [Such a [move]{.mark} would [ensure they would
be **cut off**]{.mark}]{.underline} from the west, [which would be
**devastating** for China]{.underline}.

Taiwan remains at the top of global investors' concerns when it comes to
China. China has increased military activities and made incursions into
Taiwan's airspace while the U.S. has ratcheted up its comments around
Taiwan.

But [unlike Ukraine, [Taiwan]{.mark} plays a]{.underline} much more
[**[central]{.mark} role** [in]{.mark} the **[global econ]{.mark}omy**
as]{.underline} the [heart of]{.underline} the [**semiconductor
industry**. It's also geopolitically important]{.underline} in the
delicate U.S.-China balance and [to U.S. **allies** in
Asia]{.underline}, which requires a different calculus by Beijing.
[[Conflict would **jeopardize** Xi]{.mark}'s broader policy]{.underline}
aims, not least because [it would [cut]{.mark} the [country off
from]{.mark}]{.underline} the rest of the [world before it is
self-reliant on]{.underline} various fronts, including **[critical
[tech]{.mark}]{.underline}**nology.

That [concern]{.underline} has been [[**reinforced** by watching]{.mark}
the extent of]{.underline} the [**[sanctions]{.mark}** the West has
slapped on Russia and]{.underline} the [**economic devastation**,
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[ruble
spiraling]{.underline}]{.mark}** to a record low on Monday, and the
central bank doubling interest rates, analysts say.

"[[Chinese]{.underline}]{.mark} banks [[don't want to be
**sanctioned**]{.underline}]{.mark} by the U.S. either so they are
following the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control rules," says
veteran currency strategist Marc Chandler of Bannockburn Global Forex,
noting that some Chinese banks have halted financing for purchasing
commodities from Russia.

#### Experts [overwhelmingly]{.underline} agree. 

**Blanes et al. '22** \[Irene Entringer Garcia et al.; March 31; project
manager for the Teaching, Research, and International Policy project at
William & Mary; Foreign Policy, "Poll: Will China Attack Taiwan?"\]

Will China attack Taiwan?

[When [asked if China would use]{.mark} **military [force]{.mark}**
[against Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline} or Taiwanese forces in the next
year, the [**experts' [predictions]{.mark}** [were]{.mark} **remarkably
[stable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Across the three surveys, the percentage
of respondents who said that China would attack Taiwan fluctuated
between 6 percent and nearly 11 percent; 69 to **[[71
percent]{.underline}]{.mark}** of respondents [[said China would
**not**]{.mark} **use** military force]{.underline}. This [assessment is
**not merely**]{.underline} a [matter of assuming]{.underline} peace
because [war is a relatively rare event]{.underline}: This [[**same
group** forecasted]{.underline}]{.mark} a [Russian [attack on
Ukraine]{.mark} in January [by]{.mark}]{.underline} a
[**[3-to-1]{.mark}** margin]{.underline}.

#### Taiwan is [self-sufficient]{.underline} and Beijing won't [risk it]{.underline}. 

**Hou '23** \[Philip; December 8; president of Peace for Taiwan; The
Diplomat, "China Won't Invade Taiwan -- For Now,"
https://thediplomat.com/2023/12/china-wont-invade-taiwan-for-now/\]

The **[[APEC]{.underline}]{.mark}** meeting not only [[marked]{.mark}
the beginning of [a **shift away** from]{.mark} confrontation
over]{.underline} the **[Taiwan]{.underline}** issue [but also the
culmination of trends moving away from **military
[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}: namely, [the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates' [and **Taiwan's**]{.underline} continued
[[improvements in **defense**]{.mark} **capability**]{.underline} to
fend off an invasion, [[China's]{.mark} turn inward to focus on
**[domestic issues]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
Taiwan's [[commitment to]{.mark} maintaining [the
**s**]{.mark}]{.underline}tatus **[[quo]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [These
trends]{.underline} also [[refute]{.underline}]{.mark} beliefs
predicting [[a]{.mark} Chinese **[diversionary
war]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[or China taking]{.mark} advantage of
[a]{.mark} **window of [opportunity]{.mark}**]{.underline} to invade
Taiwan.

U.S. arm sales and military aid to [**Israel** and **Ukraine** have not
completely diverted defense equipment allocated for]{.underline}
deterring an attack on **[Taiwan]{.underline}**. The Biden
administration for the first time authorized an arms package, worth
\$345 million, for Taiwan transferred directly from Pentagon stockpiles.
U.S. Army General Charles Flynn, who heads the army unit of the
Indo-Pacific Command, recently announced the future deployment of
land-based Tomahawk and SM-6 cruise missiles to the Asia-Pacific
following the deployment of NMESIS, a land-based anti-ship missile
system.

Far from distracting the United States from responding to China's
growing military prowess, [the [Ukraine]{.mark} war has [spurred]{.mark}
the]{.underline} U.S. **[d]{.underline}**efense
**[i]{.underline}**ndustrial **[b]{.underline}**ase [to increase its
**[manufacturing capacity]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[preparing]{.underline} the U.S [[to deter]{.mark} an
**[invasion]{.mark}** and fight a]{.underline} potential [**war of
attrition** in the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}. Indeed, there is also a
strong consensus in Washington that U.S. [**[resolve]{.mark}** for
aiding Ukraine and Israel [has **bolstered deterrence**]{.mark} and
changed China's calculus]{.underline} for a Taiwan operation.

Taiwan is not putting all its bets on the U.S. intervening in a
contingency either. President **[Tsai]{.underline}** Ing-wen has [placed
[defense **self-sufficiency**]{.mark} and manufacturing]{.underline} at
the center of her policy objectives. [[Taiwan]{.mark}'s
military]{.underline} under the Tsai administration [has invested
heavily in]{.underline} domestic [defense **R&D**]{.underline} and
manufacturing, [leading to the [launch]{.mark} of [its
first]{.mark}]{.underline} domestically manufactured [**attack
[submarine]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}]{.underline} deployment of [supersonic
**[cruise missiles]{.mark}**]{.underline} capable of reaching Beijing.
Despite the arms backlogs from the United States, [Taiwan's
**[domestic]{.mark}** industrial [base]{.mark}]{.underline}, with U.S.
assistance, [[supports a]{.mark} formidable [force for
**denying**]{.mark} **an [invasion]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

**NATO is [bolstering]{.underline} Arctic security now,
[despite]{.underline} no official declarations** to do so.

[[Despite]{.mark} the [lack of]{.mark} an [official Arctic
position]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[NATO]{.mark} and]{.underline} its
[member states]{.underline} have [[taken]{.mark} a [greater interest in
Arctic]{.mark} affairs in **recent years**, and especially
**following**]{.underline} the second invasion of
**[Ukraine]{.underline}**. [NATO [exercises]{.mark} in the Arctic have
[become]{.mark} more **[frequent]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and NATO
member states' [warships and sub]{.mark}marine[s]{.mark} have been
[making]{.mark} [port]{.mark}]{.underline} calls more
[**[often]{.mark}** in northern Norway]{.underline} and [operating in
nearby waters [as part of]{.mark} NATO **[missions]{.mark}** and in
**[cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline} with the Norwegian Armed
Forces.33)

[[A **significant policy shift**]{.mark} for NATO's northern
engagement]{.underline} has [come [from **Canada**]{.mark}]{.underline},
which has [increasingly [welcomed **NATO exercises**]{.mark} on its
territory]{.underline} and [stated]{.underline} in its [recent Arctic
policy that it is [**committed** to]{.mark} supporting information
sharing with NATO and [strengthening]{.mark} **situational awareness**
in the [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. While Canada still relies more on
its relationship with the United States in the scope of NORAD rather
than NATO, [this encouraging language towards NATO
cooperation]{.underline} ["indicates a significant shift in Canada's
official position]{.underline}."34) [Montreal]{.underline}, Canada
[will]{.underline} also be the [host]{.underline} of t[he new NATO
Centre of Excellence for Climate Change and Security]{.underline}, which
was announced in summer 2023.35) An August 2022 visit by NATO Secretary
General Jens [Stoltenberg was another positive sign regarding
Canada-NATO relations]{.underline}. During the trip, Stoltenberg visited
the Canadian Arctic with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and stated that
NATO must step up its presence in the Arctic.36)

[Efforts to **improve [cooperation]{.mark}** [and **defense**
are]{.mark}]{.underline} also [**[ongoing]{.mark}** in the **European
Arctic**]{.underline}. [Even prior to]{.underline} Russia's full-scale
invasion of [Ukraine]{.underline} and Finland and Sweden's bids to join
NATO[, the [Nordic states]{.mark} discussed [forming a
**joint**]{.mark}]{.underline} [Nordic]{.underline} [**[air
force]{.mark}** to improve communication and defense]{.underline}
between Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Finland.37) According to journalists
and military sources, [the project has **received** even **more
support**]{.underline} [since]{.underline} the events of 2022.38) High
North News pointed out in summer 2023 that [there is a
**[larger]{.mark}** than normal [military presence]{.mark} of both
**American** and **NATO** forces [in
**Iceland**]{.mark}]{.underline},39) and that [[Norway]{.mark} is
working on [developing]{.mark} an **[air command]{.mark}** center [in
northern Norway]{.mark} in [collaboration with]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}t]{.mark}ates [and
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[K]{.underline}]{.mark}ingdom, which
[called itself "the Arctic's nearest neighbor]{.underline}" in 2013 and
2015 policy documents.40) In September 2023, NATO's defense chiefs met
in Oslo for a conference on NATO's Military Committee, during which
Norwegian Defense Minister Bjørn Arild Gram said that ["NATO is the
north]{.underline}" and that the addition of Finland and Sweden into the
Alliance means that the [Nordic states will]{.underline} have a
responsibility to [develop "NATO's deterrence in the northern
areas]{.underline}."41) At the same conference, Norwegian Chief of
Defence Eirik Kristoffersen added that [2024 would also see the
[**largest exercise** held]{.mark} in the Nordic region]{.underline},
called Nordic Response, during which the new joint Nordic air defense
would be tested.42) [Nordic Response]{.underline} took place in March
this year [[in]{.mark} the Norwegian [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} [[with
**20,000 soldiers**]{.mark} from **13 countries**]{.underline}, and [was
a "crucial [**first step** in implementing]{.mark} NATO's **[regional

Conclusion

[Building gradually from 2006]{.underline} [and]{.underline} growing
over the [last decade especially]{.underline}, [tensions in the Arctic
have risen]{.underline} to levels unseen since the days of the Cold War.
[[Hard security is at the]{.mark} [**forefront** of]{.mark} Northern
European [policy agendas]{.mark} once again]{.underline}, with
[[military strategists]{.mark} and defense experts [discussing]{.mark}
the **[GIUK]{.mark}** gap]{.underline}, [Arctic **[missile
placements]{.mark}**, and increased **military exercises** in the
north]{.underline}. [While NATO does **not** have an **official Arctic
policy**]{.underline} or command center, [it is [**very much present**
in the region]{.mark}, both through its historic guardian of the
northern flank]{.underline}, [**Norway**, active participants
**Canada**, the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates,
[**Iceland** and **Denmark**, and newest members **Finland** and
**Sweden**]{.underline}. In recent years, countless newspaper articles
have voiced concerns about a "new Cold War" in the north. Some experts
argue that in fact [the Cold War never ended in the Arctic]{.underline},
considering that [most [military installations]{.mark} in the region
have [remained]{.mark} **at the [ready]{.mark}**]{.underline} even while
the Arctic was regarded as a "zone of peace" in diplomatic circles.44)

[Rethinking the **affordability question**]{.underline}

Primarily, [the "**[pivot to Asia]{.mark}**" argument rests on the
[**assumption** that]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[no longer has]{.mark} the [**resources**
for both]{.mark} the **European** and the **Asian
[theaters]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But [is this really the case? US
defense **spending** has been **below its historical
average**]{.underline} [for]{.underline} several [decades]{.underline}.
According to a World Bank assessment[, the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [spent more than 9 percent of its GDP on defense in
the 1960s]{.underline}. Cold War-era defense expenditures averaged 5 to
6 percent of GDP. [Today, defense spending is around 3.5
percent]{.underline}. [The point here is not to debate what percentage
of GDP should be spent]{.underline} on defense, [but rather to show that
the concept of [a force]{.mark}]{.underline} [[only capable]{.mark} of
all-out war [in **one theater**]{.mark} is]{.underline} predominantly
[[a **political decision**]{.mark} during the past thirty years, [not a
**necessity** driven by]{.mark} **resource
[constraints]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The real]{.underline} [question
is]{.underline} where national defense fits in the United States'
overall budgetary priorities, determined by [overall threat
perceptions]{.underline}.

First [floated more than a decade ago by]{.underline} then President
Barack [Obama]{.underline}[, [the "**pivot to
Asia**"]{.underline}]{.mark} [signaled the arrival of a new era of US
confrontation with China in the **Indo-Pacific**]{.underline} and
beyond. [Until]{.underline} the war in [Ukraine, the need for a
pivot]{.underline} away [[from a **supposedly ungrateful**
Europe]{.underline}]{.mark} and [toward **fast-growing
Asia**]{.underline} [was [increasingly]{.mark} becoming
[orthodoxy]{.mark}]{.underline} within the US foreign-policy
establishment---[[from]{.mark} "**[realist]{.mark}**" and "**liberal
internationalist**" [scholars]{.mark} in **academia**]{.underline} to
think tanks to talk-show hosts. China has been prominently featured in
the Biden administration's recent National Security Strategy and
National Defense Strategy, though with the recognition of the
[revisionist nature of Russia's power]{.underline}.

[Today [the war now **raging** in]{.mark} Eastern [Europe]{.mark} has
[shown]{.mark} that [the "**pivot" approach** was
**misguided**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It's [not in]{.mark} the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tate[s']{.underline} [[interest to
**turn away** from Europe]{.underline}]{.mark} [as it asserts itself in
Asia]{.underline}---and [the [country is **rich** and **powerful
enough** to secure]{.mark} its interests in **[both
theaters]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[The "pivot]{.mark} to Asia" [**school** misreads]{.mark} how global
[power]{.mark} is distributed [and **takes for
granted**]{.mark}]{.underline} the United States' [continued economic
**[decline]{.mark}** and **societal fracturing**.]{.underline} These
[adherents assert that we are now in a multipolar world driving toward a
Chinese empire by century's end]{.underline}, [with the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [a declining power
and]{.underline} [Russia a]{.underline} somewhat [distant]{.underline}
third [great power]{.underline}---allowed in the club on account of its
nuclear weapons, territorial bulk, and natural resources. Such [analyses
**rely predominantly** on **comparisons** of]{.underline} gross domestic
product ([GDP]{.underline}), [population]{.underline} figures, [and
military size and **professed capabilities**]{.underline}.

But [[theorizing]{.mark} about [**multipolarity** must be **checked**
against **realities**]{.mark} **on the ground**]{.underline}. [We
are]{.underline} currently [watching Russia]{.underline} near the
one-year mark of a [war against a country that]{.underline}---[according
to virtually all analysts]{.underline} and policy theorists---it [should
have overrun in a matter of weeks]{.underline}. In Ukraine, we are
seeing once again that [wars between states are **not just** about
**sheer numbers**,]{.underline} whether GDP or populations or budgetary
dollars and cents. [The United States would do well to factor this
lesson]{.underline} [into its own grand strategic calculus]{.underline}
going forward, [especially on]{.underline} the [Chinese challenge in
Asia]{.underline}.

### Cooperation\-\--1NC

#### Russia is defensive in the Arctic and cooperation successfully prevents conflict

Alex **Little 24**. \[An M.S. graduate of Georgia Tech and a writer with
Young Voices. He worked as a Development Assistant at the Cato Institute
and is also a former Marcellus Policy Fellow with the John Quincy Adams
Society. "What will NATO do with its giant Arctic footprint?"

The recent accession of Sweden means that [seven of eight]{.underline}
of the world's [Arctic nations]{.underline} fall [under NATO's security
umbrella]{.underline}, with [Russia being the outlier]{.underline}.
While some analysts see the addition of Sweden and Finland as an
opportunity for NATO to "increase its footprint" and "deter Russia,"
[[the last thing the alliance needs is]{.mark} to scour]{.underline} for
[[another avenue for confrontation with Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Sweden and Finland's NATO membership undoubtedly affects the alliance's
influence in the Arctic. In March, over 20,000 NATO soldiers from 13
nations, including Finland, Sweden, and the United States, participated
in the latest leg of the ongoing Nordic Response 2024 exercise in
Norway. Additionally, over 50 frigates, submarines, and other vessels,
as well as over 100 aircraft, were involved in the exercise. Ultimately,
Nordic Response 2024 will involve over 90,000 troops from all 32 NATO
allies.

Defensive exercises are a necessary feature of NATO's newly increased
Arctic presence, but [[the Russian threat]{.mark} in the Arctic
**[should not be inflated]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[The Arctic served as a frontline]{.underline} in the confrontation
[between NATO and the Soviet Union during the Cold War.]{.underline}
Over several decades, [Russia has revitalized Soviet-era Arctic bases,
which outnumber NATO]{.underline}'s by about a third. In recent years,
[Russia has]{.underline} launched [significant investment]{.underline}
projects and built up its military presence in the Arctic as it develops
a crucial northern maritime route linking Asia
and [Europe](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/regions/europe/). The
United States only has one operational heavy icebreaker --- compared to
the 40 that Russia currently maintains.

Irrespective of hawks sounding the alarm about Russia's supposed
"militarization" and "dominance" of the Arctic, [**[Russia retains
a relative incapacity]{.mark}** to threaten]{.underline} a conventional
military land incursion into European [Arctic territory]{.underline}.
[[Moscow]{.underline}'s]{.mark} military [[efforts in the Arctic]{.mark}
[have been]{.mark} **mainly [defensive]{.mark}**]{.underline} in nature
as it has established multi-layered anti-access, area-denial (A2/AD)
capabilities around the Kola Peninsula, a fundamental Russian interest.

[Such developments pose little threat to]{.underline} the United States
and its [NATO]{.underline} allies, especially as Russia is bogged down
in Ukraine.

Moreover, given that Russia's Arctic coastline is ten times longer than
America's, the "icebreaker gap" is to be expected. Russia's fleet of
icebreakers is primarily dedicated to escorting commercial shipping
through dangerous polar seas. Otherwise, it performs the same missions
as the U.S. Coast Guard: "search and rescue, anti-smuggling, oil spill
response, and resupply of remote coastal communities and polar research
stations."

Regarding force projection capabilities, the American-dominated NATO
nuclear submarine fleet outmatches the opposing Northern Fleet of the
Russian navy.

On top of NATO's military capabilities, the alliance's most influential
member, the United States, has placed little military importance on the
Arctic. Russia's inability to pose severe threats in the Arctic has led
to the region appearing at the bottom of the list in the 2022
Biden-Harris National Security Strategy (NSS) overview of regional
policies. In addition, the document lacks any language regarding
deterring threats to Arctic allies and partners.

[[Rather than]{.underline}]{.mark} seeing the addition of Finland and
Sweden as an opportunity to [[increase the militarization of the Arctic,
NATO should]{.underline}]{.mark} work toward utilizing working groups
like the Arctic Council to [**[forge multilateral]{.mark}
[arrangements to reduce tensions]{.mark}**, avoid crises, [and mitigate
the risk]{.mark}s [of conflict through]{.mark} an accident or
[miscalc]{.mark}]{.underline}ulation.

In February, Russia suspended annual payments to the Arctic Council
until \"real work resumes with the participation of all member
countries." Yet, while [Russia]{.underline} removed several listed
multilateral formats from its official Arctic strategy, it [kept the
point of "the Arctic Council]{.underline} as the key regional platform
coordinating international activities in the region." Thus, [[Russia
doesn't appear poised to form an alternative]{.underline}]{.mark}
platform.

Tensions are high, and Arctic Council cooperation with Moscow
effectively ceased after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Despite this,
the Council [[should refrain from]{.mark} pushing out the largest Arctic
player and [severing]{.mark} an essential [communication
channel]{.mark}. Deepening isolation has pushed Russia
to look]{.underline} east [for]{.underline} partners in the Arctic,
namely [China]{.underline}. [[Further ostracization will]{.mark} only
[incentivize Russia to coordinate]{.mark} more [with
Beijing]{.mark}]{.underline} in the region.

[Russia and NATO share an interest in maintaining peace in the
Arctic]{.underline} region. A war in such terrain would be extremely
costly and difficult for both sides. Furthermore, the Arctic Council
has facilitated the improvement of marine safety in the Bering Strait,
where the U.S. and Russia share a maritime border. [Communication
channels and [shared objectives must]{.mark} also [be]{.mark} kept
[open]{.mark}]{.underline} to keep the peace there.

Amid a worsening situation in Ukraine, escalation in the Arctic region
would do no favors for the United States or its NATO allies. Russia's
considerable influence in the Arctic is not going to change in the near
future. Therefore, [[taking advantage of]{.mark} [existing channels will
**enable the West to signal to Russia** that NATO does not intend to
engage in offensive operations]{.mark}]{.underline} but is fully
prepared to defend its interests.

#### Coop with Russia is key to NATO and Russia says yes

to cooperate with NATO despite its aggressive nature" TASS. 11/08/2019.

MOSCOW, November 8. /TASS/. [[NATO has]{.mark} always [been an
instrument of aggression]{.mark}]{.underline} and confrontation,
[[however, **Russia is willing to cooperate**]{.mark} with the
alliance]{.underline}, [[Kremlin Spokesman]{.underline}]{.mark} Dmitry
Peskov [[told]{.underline}]{.mark} reporters on Friday.

\"We have repeatedly stated that [NATO is an alliance created
for]{.underline} the purpose of [confrontation]{.underline},\" the
Kremlin official stressed. \"[However, [Russia has never avoided
coop]{.mark}]{.underline}eration with NATO; [[it has always been
open]{.underline}]{.mark} to it.\"

Peskov added that the Russian side had never overemphasized the role of
NATO in ensuring global European security and stability. \"Because this
is an instrument of confrontation, and event at times aggression. This
is our opinion of NATO,\" he reiterated.

The Kremlin official reminded of [the Russia-NATO Council]{.underline},
adding that cooperation within this body \"[has been scaled
down]{.underline} practically to the level of expert interaction\" not
on the initiative of Moscow. \"[[NATO may be alive or
dead]{.underline}]{.mark}, and we are no coroners to examine and decide
which parts of NATO are comatose,\" Peskov said, commenting on the
recent statement by French President Emmanuel Macron.

In a recent interview with the Economist, Macron criticized the current
state of NATO. \"What [we are currently experiencing]{.underline} is
[the]{.underline} brain **[death of [NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}**,\" he
said. According to the French president, [Europe [stands on]{.mark}
\"the edge of [a]{.mark} [precipice\" and needs to start
thinking]{.mark}]{.underline} of itself **[[strategically]{.mark} as a
geopolitical power]{.underline}**; [otherwise, it will no longer be in
control of its destiny]{.underline}.

NRout

MOSCOW, March 27 (Reuters) - [Geopolitical [rivalries are intensifying
in the Arctic but **Russia is willing to cooperate**]{.mark} with
foreign partners, including from the West]{.underline}, in economic
ventures there [that will **benefit all sides**]{.underline}, Russian
President Vladimir **[[Putin said]{.underline}]{.mark}** on Thursday.

In a major speech, Putin said U.S. President Donald Trump\'s stated
intention to acquire Greenland was \"serious\", and it was clear that
the U.S. would continue to promote its interests in the Arctic. The
Greenland question had nothing to do with Russia, he said.

But [Moscow was concerned that \"NATO]{.underline} countries in general
are increasingly [designating the far north as a springboard
for]{.underline} possible [conflicts]{.underline}, practising the use of
troops in these conditions, including by their \'new recruits\', Finland
and Sweden,\" he said, referring to the alliance\'s latest members.

[Russia was]{.underline} monitoring the situation and [building a
response]{.underline}, including by boosting its military capabilities
in the region.

\"[We will not allow encroachments]{.underline} on the sovereignty of
our country [and will reliably **protect our national
interests**]{.underline},\" Putin said.

Focus on the Arctic\'s strategic importance for mining, shipping and
security has increased sharply because of repeated statements
by Trump that he wants to acquire Greenland. He has not ruled out doing
so by force.

The Arctic holds fossil fuels and minerals beneath the land and the
seabed that could become more accessible with global warming. It is also
an area of military competition, where defence analysts say Russia has
built up its presence much faster than the West by reopening Soviet-era
bases and modernising its navy.

The United States sees the Arctic as crucial for natural security,
including for its early warning system against nuclear attacks.

[[The Kremlin says the Arctic is]{.mark} a zone [of]{.mark}]{.underline}
Russian [[strategic interest, and suggested]{.underline}]{.mark} in
February [[that **Russia and the U.S. could work together** to]{.mark}
[develop]{.mark}]{.underline} natural resources
[[there]{.underline}]{.mark} as the two countries pursue a fast-moving
rapprochement that has unnerved Ukraine and its European allies.

NORTHERN SEA ROUTE

On the economic front, Putin has made it a top priority to ramp up
commerce via the Northern Sea Route (NSR) through Arctic waters as
Russia shifts trade towards Asia and away from Europe because of Western
sanctions. Oil shipments from Russian ports to China via the NSR rose by
a quarter last year.

[Foreign partners prepared to cooperate with Russia]{.underline} on
investment projects in the region [would be guaranteed a good
return]{.underline}, Putin said.

He called for an expansion of Russia\'s northern ports and the building
of a merchant fleet in the Arctic, supported by new-generation
icebreakers including nuclear-powered ones.

But [he said [Russia\'s domestic capabilities were
insufficient]{.mark}]{.underline} for this [at the moment, [and]{.mark}
that [it would]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[require]{.underline}]{.mark}
buying vessels and [interacting with [foreign
shipbuilders]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Russia was already successfully shipping oil and liquefied natural gas
via the NSR, he said.

\"Now we need to create conditions for the growth of effective domestic
operators that will engage in transporting containers of coal, bulk and
other cargo through the Arctic. [[We are also]{.mark} [open]{.mark} here
[to]{.mark} the creation of [joint ventures,\"]{.mark}]{.underline} he
added.

[[International]{.mark} logistics [firms could supply]{.mark} capital,
[technology and]{.mark} merchant [ships to support]{.mark} this, he
said.]{.underline}

Putin delivered his speech to a conference on the Arctic in Murmansk, a
port from which the NSR runs eastward across the top of Russia to the
Bering Strait near Alaska.

He said Murmansk\'s port capacity should be at least trebled in the
coming years, with construction of new terminals and railway links, and
\"partners\" from Belarus, China, the United Arab Emirates and other
countries were showing interest in this project.

#### Ukraine cannot permanently disrupt Arctic cooperation

The Arctic is a potential goldmine for energy resources and shipping
routes, often governed by complex bilateral agreements between the
Arctic states. [[The eight Arctic countries]{.underline}]{.mark} --
Canada, Finland, Denmark, the United States, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and
Russia -- [[typically collaborate]{.underline}]{.mark}. [United
by]{.underline} their [shared Arctic coastline]{.underline}, harsh
environmental conditions [have led them to forge agreements on maritime
law,]{.underline} environmental balance [and security needs]{.underline}
as basic as conducting effective search-and-rescue operations. 

"[The [relationships in the Arctic are **not**]{.mark} **ones that can
be [broken]{.mark}**]{.underline} apart [quickly, [easily]{.mark} or
lightly, [nor should they be]{.mark},]{.underline}" said Dr Melanie
Garson, lecturer in international conflict resolution and security in
the political science department of University College London, in an
interview with FRANCE 24. "[There are critical issues]{.underline} [in
the Arctic that need to be kept stable for]{.underline} short-term and
long-term [stability]{.underline}."

\<\<\<TEXT CONDENSED, NONE REMOVED\>\>\>

But there are signs that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is already
disrupting this careful balance. Russia now shares the Arctic coastline
with five NATO member states, plus Finland and Sweden ­-- all of whom are
sending military and financial support to help Ukraine fight against the
Russian invasion. All the members of the Arctic Council aside from
Russia announced in March they would boycott talks in Russia, currently
chairing the Atlantic Council until 2023, due to its "flagrant
violation" of Ukraine's sovereignty. As such, the group's work has been
put on hold. "It's very unusual," Garson says. "The Arctic Council has
survived periods of tension, but what we\'re seeing in the Ukraine is a
huge turning point in history. We can\'t dismiss how that might affect
tried and tested alliances." 'A fifth ocean on top of the world'
Political and economic concerns in the Arctic are defined by its unique
and rapidly changing climate. While the south Arctic is covered in
forests, further north the land becomes treeless, dominated by tundra,
deserts and ice that is rapidly melting due to climate change. In the
past 30 years the thickest ice in the Arctic has declined by 95 percent.
If greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase at their current rate,
the Arctic could be ice-free in the summer by 2040. Increased human
presence poses an additional threat to a natural landscape that is
already under pressure. Traditionally, the urgent climate situation has
been a key reason for international cooperation. The first step towards
the formation of the Arctic Council was the Arctic Environmental
Protection Strategy signed in 1991 as an agreement between the Arctic
states and Indigenous people's organisations. But the dramatic loss of
ice is changing the political and economic landscape in the region. "We
have basically a fifth ocean opening on the top of the world," said
Katarzyna Zysk, professor at the Norwegian Institute for Defence
Studies. "And when that ocean is open, it will be used for economic and
military purposes." In Russia, loss of ice is also changing the military
focus. Of the total Arctic Ocean coastline, 53 percent is Russian. "It
is a huge, vast area," Zysk says. "Those borders were protected by ice,
but now the ice is disappearing. That means the region can be used,
potentially, in an attack on Russia." Consequently, Russia has been
increasing its military presence in the far north. The most obvious
example of this is its Arctic navy, the Northern Fleet, based on the
Kola Peninsula near the border with Finland and Norway. Its arsenal
includes submarines armed with nuclear-powered missiles, anti-submarine
aircraft, aircraft carriers and ships armed with missiles, among others.
"The Northern Fleet is the strongest part of the Russian Navy," Zysk
says. "Russia has their largest share of strategic submarines and other
important non-nuclear capabilities on the Kola Peninsula." 'Ukraine was
a game changer' In 2014 -- the same year that Russia annexed the Crimean
peninsula from Ukraine -- the Northern Fleet became the main component
in a strengthened military presence in the north, called Northern Fleet
Joint Strategic Command. To international observers, Russia's military
activities in the Arctic took on an increasingly aggressive stance,
raising the stakes for other Arctic states. "The major thrust of NATO\'s
interests in the Arctic came after the annexation of Crimea," Zysk says.
"Ukraine was a game changer, because even though Russia had been
generally cooperative and predictable in the Arctic, NATO could not
detach what Russia was doing in Ukraine from its military expansion in
the Arctic." This meant also increasing NATO's presence in the Arctic to
ensure that if Article Five were triggered by a Russian attack in the
region, the group could provide the required collective defence.
However, Russia also continued increasing its forces. From 2016 onwards,
it upped the frequency of its military exercises in the Arctic, even
displaying an "ability to project power beyond its Arctic waters and
assert maritime control", according to the nonprofit policy research
organisation The Center for Strategic and International Studies. The
current war in Ukraine has raised the stakes once again. If Sweden and
Finland join NATO ­-- as both are seriously considering doing ­-- all the
Arctic states except Russia will be part of the military alliance. "NATO
will then have a strategic re-evaluation of how the Arctic sits within
the alliance, and decisions NATO will take will set the future
relationship," Garson says. "Given the rumblings from Russia about this
potential NATO expansion, that could cause tension." Most recently,
these rumblings include an April 14 threat that if Sweden and Finland
join NATO then Russia would deploy nuclear weapons and hypersonic
missiles to the Baltic region. "There are some scenarios you could
imagine, where Russia would challenge Article Five," Zysk says. "One
possibility is that Russia could do it in the Arctic because it has a
relatively strong military presence there compared to the other NATO
states." 'The leading actor in the Arctic' However, Russia is not
necessarily building up its military force in the Arctic for an attack
-- it has plenty there to protect, too. A 2008 study by the US
Geological Survey found that the Arctic could be home to the largest
unexplored oil and gas reserves on Earth, storing billions of barrels of
unmined energy resources. Much of the reserves are thought to be
offshore, in Russian seas. Oil and gas are not the only potential
assets. "The region is very rich not only in energy, but also mineral
resources, a lot of which are in the Russian Arctic," Zysk says. "There
are also very well-preserved fish stocks that are valuable, considering
the growing food crisis in the world." In addition there is potential
for a lucrative economic future as a transport hub. The Northern Sea
Route that runs along Russia's north coast is currently blocked by ice
for most of the year -- but if it weren't, it could become a highly
profitable shipping channel. For example, shipping times and fuel costs
for transporting goods between China and Europe would be cut
dramatically if they could travel via the Arctic instead of the current
route via South Asia and through the Suez Canal. These possible future
scenarios have increased international interest in the Arctic. In
addition to the eight core members with territories in the Arctic, the
Arctic Council also has 13 council observers that can propose projects
in the region. These include France, Germany, the UK and, most notably,
China, which has been actively setting up Arctic research stations and
investing in mining and energy. This international interest in the
riches of the Arctic has also compelled Russia to play a more dominant
role in the region. "It has been stimulating Russia to strengthen its
position, because Russia sees itself as the leading actor in the Arctic
-- and for good reasons, if you look at the geography," Zysk says. So
far, however, there seems to be little appetite from Russia to extend
this role to military clashes in the far north, despite the
confrontation in Ukraine pitting Arctic states against each other.

\<\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUME\>\>\>

"My reading is that [[Russia has been]{.mark} actually [trying to avoid
escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}," Zysk says. [Following NATO exercises
with Finland and Sweden]{.underline} in early March, NATO troops
participated in another exercise in Norway on March 25. [The Russia
response was muted]{.underline} -- it released a statement in protest,
and conducted its own military training exercises on the same day.

"[[Russia]{.mark} always [protests when NATO does]{.mark} military
[exercises close to its borders]{.mark}]{.underline}," Zysk says. "[[But
we haven\'t seen any provocative behaviour]{.mark} from Russia [in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. I think [Russia is actually trying **to
avoid escalating**]{.underline} \[international reaction to\] the
conflict in Ukraine, and also its military is already fully engaged
there." 

Among Western allies, too, [the war in [Ukraine]{.mark} may prove to be
a turning point]{.underline} for political relations in the Arctic,
**[but [not necessarily a rupture]{.mark}]{.underline}**. "The Arctic
Council has paused, temporarily, its work, but **[it['s not
breaking]{.mark} [apart]{.mark}]{.underline}**," Garson says. "More than
anything, trust has been severely broken in relationships with Russia,
so [[Arctic states are rethinking how they go
forward]{.mark}." ]{.underline}

In a part of the world dominated by such a challenging natural landscape
it might be that the necessity for [collaboration and [cooperation
between Arctic states]{.mark} ultimately [overrides]{.mark} political
[tensions]{.mark}. "The Arctic is governed by]{.underline} quite
[a]{.underline} complex [web]{.underline} of bilateral and [multilateral
agreements]{.underline}, and I think the [[nations will be careful of

#### No energy wars.

**Meierding 20** -- Dr. Emily Meierding, National Security Professor at
the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Political Science PhD at the
University of Chicago. \[The Exaggerated Threat of Oil Wars, 3-20-2021,
https://www.lawfareblog.com/exaggerated-threat-oil-wars\]

Happily, [**the historical record** indicates]{.underline} that China
and [its]{.underline} neighbors are [**unlikely** to
escalate]{.underline} their [**energy sparring**. Contrary to
**overheated rhetoric**, countries do not actually "**take the
oil**,"]{.underline} to use President Trump's controversial and
inaccurate phrase. Instead, my recent research demonstrates that
[countries **avoid** fighting for **oil resources**]{.underline}.

No Blood for Oil

[Between 1912 and 2010, [countries fought **180 times** over
territories]{.mark} that contained---or were **[believed to
contain]{.mark}**---**[oil or]{.mark} natural [gas]{.mark}
resources**]{.underline}. These conflicts ranged from brief, nonfatal
border violations, like Turkish jets entering Greek airspace, to the two
world wars. Many of these clashes---including World War II, Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait (1990), the U.S. invasion of Iraq (2003), the
Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), the Falklands War (1982), and the Chaco War
between Bolivia and Paraguay (1932-1935)---have been described as
classic oil wars: that is, severe international conflicts in which
countries fight to obtain petroleum resources.

However, [**a closer look** at these conflicts reveals]{.underline} that
[**none** merits the classic "**oil war**" label]{.underline}. Although
countries did fight over oil-endowed territories, they usually fought
for other reasons, including aspirations to regional hegemony, domestic
politics, national pride, or contested territories' other strategic,
economic, or symbolic assets. [Oil was **an uncommon trigger** for
**international confrontations** and **never caused major
conflicts**]{.underline}.

On approximately 20 occasions, over almost a century, countries engaged
in minor conflicts to obtain oil resources. However, these ["**oil
[spats]{.mark}**" [were **brief**]{.mark}, **mild**]{.underline}, mostly
**[[nonfatal]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and generally involved countries
whose hostility predated their resource competition. Greece and Turkey
have prosecuted oil spats. So have China and Vietnam, Guyana and
Venezuela, and a dozen other pairs of countries. These [confrontations
inspired **aggressive rhetoric**]{.underline} while they were underway,
[but **[none]{.mark} of them** ever **[escalated]{.mark} into a larger
armed conflict**]{.underline}.

Oil has periodically influenced the trajectories of major conflicts that
were launched for other reasons. At the end of World War I, British
troops seized Mosul province in order to secure its oil resources. Oil
aspirations also motivated Germany's invasion of the Russian Caucasus
(1941-1942) and Japan's invasion of the Dutch East Indies (1941-1942).
While the latter attack precipitated U.S. involvement in World War II,
it was also a continuation of the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945).
All of these "oil campaigns" were inspired by aggressors' wartime
resource needs. Absent the ongoing conflicts, these countries would not
have fought for oil.

The historical record also reveals one "oil gambit": Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait in 1990. Conventional explanations for the attack assert that
Saddam Hussein was either greedily attempting to grab his neighbor's oil
resources or needily attempting to limit Kuwait's oil output in order to
raise oil prices and escape from a deepening economic crisis caused by
falling oil prices and Iraq's large debts, incurred during the Iran-Iraq
War. The first explanation is wrong. The second is correct, but
incomplete, because it omits Saddam's larger motive for aggression: his
fear of the United States. The regime's records, seized during the 2003
U.S. invasion, reveal Saddam's belief, nurtured since the 1970s, that
the United States was determined to contain Iraq and remove him from
power. In 1990, this false conviction led Saddam to assume that the
United States was engineering Iraq's economic crisis by encouraging
Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates to exceed their OPEC oil production
quotas and refuse Iraq's repeated entreaties to cancel its war debts.
After his infamous meeting with U.S. Ambassador April Glaspie failed to
persuade Saddam of the United States's benign intentions, he concluded
that conquering Kuwait was his only remaining means of survival. Fear of
U.S. hostility, not oil aspirations, prompted Iraq to invade Kuwait.

A Question of Value

The absence of oil wars is surprising and counterintuitive. Petroleum is
an exceptionally valuable resource. It fuels all countries' economies
and militaries. Oil sales are also a crucial revenue source for producer
states. Surely, countries are willing to fight to obtain petroleum
resources.

In fact, [**classic oil [wars]{.mark}** [are]{.mark} extraordinarily
[costly]{.mark}. A country that aims [to seize]{.mark} **foreign
[oil]{.mark}** [faces]{.mark}, first, the [costs of **invading**]{.mark}
**another country**. International [aggression is]{.mark} **destructive
and [expensive]{.mark} under the best of circumstances**. [It
may]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[damage]{.mark} the]{.underline} oil
**[[infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [[a conqueror hopes to
acquire]{.underline}]{.mark}. Next, if a conqueror plans to exploit oil
resources over the long term, it faces the costs of occupying seized
territory. As the United States has learned from its "endless wars,"
[**foreign [occupation]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} **extremely
[challenging]{.mark}**]{.underline}, even for the world's most powerful
country.

Additionally, a conqueror faces international approbation for oil grabs.
As censorious responses to Trump's proposition that the United States
"take the oil" from Syria, Iraq and Libya have indicated, seizing
another country's oil is considered reprobate behavior. It violates
international laws against plunder and materially threatens to
consolidate control over global oil resources. As Iraq learned in 1990,
other countries and international institutions respond to oil grabs with
diplomatic censure, economic sanctions and even military force. Finally,
if a conqueror manages to maintain control over foreign oil resources,
it may not be able to exploit them. [[Conquest **scares
off**]{.underline}]{.mark} the foreign oil
[[companies]{.underline}]{.mark} that many countries rely on to finance
and manage oil production.

[[Because of]{.mark} **the high [costs]{.mark}** [of
**invasion**]{.mark}, **occupation**, [and]{.mark} **international
[opprobrium]{.mark}**]{.underline}, classic [oil wars are simply not
worth the effort]{.underline}, regardless of petroleum's value.
Countries may occasionally decide that it is worth initiating an oil
spat to obtain desired resources, especially when targeted territories
are contested and other issues are at stake. However,
**[[fighting]{.mark} major conflicts]{.underline}** for oil [[does not
pay]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Keep Your Eyes Off the Prize

All of [this is **[good news]{.mark}** [for
stability]{.mark}]{.underline} in the South China Sea and other oil-rich
regions. There is [[no]{.underline}]{.mark} reason to expect that
China's recent energy sparring with Vietnam and Malaysia will escalate
into a **[[larger]{.mark} international
[conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**, at least with regard to the oil at
stake. Oil spats never do, no matter how acrimonious they appear while
underway.

### Energy Wars\-\--2NC

#### No correlation between resources and war.

**Atkins, 16**---PhD Candidate in Energy, Environment & Resilience at
the University of Bristol (Ed, "Environmental Conflict: A Misnomer?,"

dml)

The economic and strategic importance of oil and other non-renewable
resource is indisputable. Yet [the [globalised]{.mark} character of
international [commerce]{.mark} has [resulted in]{.mark} many [nations
ceasing to perceive]{.mark} **resource [dependency]{.mark}** [as **a
threat**]{.mark} **to autonomy or survival**]{.underline} (Deudney,
1990). This [[interdependence]{.mark} has resulted in the
**[decreased]{.mark} likelihood of inter-state [conflict]{.mark}**
[]{.mark}over control of resources, [due to]{.mark} the price
[shocks]{.mark} these actions could propel across the
system]{.underline} and the increasingly technological developments
(Lipschutz and Holdren, 1990). [Such dynamics are **well illustrated**
by [the **1973 oil crisis**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Dabelko and Dabelko,
1993). Although [the move by]{.underline} the Organisation of Arab
Petroleum Exporting Countries ([OAPEC]{.underline}) [to restrict
exports]{.underline} resulted in record price rises and the
transformation of the international sphere, thus illustrating the
economic relevance of resources, it **[[did not result in]{.mark}
international violent [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Furthermore, Le
Billon (2001) has stated that [the spectre of resource scarcity has
resulted in the escalation of **socioeconomic [innovation]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} **economic [diversification]{.mark}** [-- with]{.mark} the
[market]{.mark} mechanism[s]{.mark} of contemporary capitalism creating
an **important [imped]{.mark}iment to [conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
In Botswana and Norway, [minerals and oil]{.underline}, respectively,
[have been mobilised to ensure **peaceful development rather than
violent confrontation**]{.underline} (Le Billon, 2001). Furthermore, in
many cases [potential [scarcity has resulted in]{.mark} increased
**inter-state [coop]{.mark}eration** [due to]{.mark} the **[shared
interest]{.mark} in continued supply**. The continued sanctity of the
1960 **Indus Waters Treaty**]{.underline}, between Pakistan and India,
[is an **important example**, with the spirit of cooperation over water
resources **enduring despite increased political tensions** between the
two nations]{.underline} (Wolf, 1998).

#### They don't escalate.

**Atkins, 16**---PhD Candidate in Energy, Environment & Resilience at
the University of Bristol (Ed, "Environmental Conflict: A Misnomer?,"
<http://www.e-ir.info/2016/05/12/environmental-conflict-a-misnomer/>,
dml)

It is important to note that [such [conflicts]{.mark} **predominantly
[occur]{.mark}** [on an **intra-state basis**]{.mark}, **rather** than
**between two nations**. **[International conflict]{.mark}** over
environmental factors [remain **unlikely**]{.mark} -- whether [due
to]{.mark} the **[robust]{.mark} nature** of the world [trade]{.mark}
system [and]{.mark} dynamics of supply and demand or to the **spread of
small [arms]{.mark}** [transforming]{.mark} the notion of
[traditional]{.mark} conflict]{.underline} (Deudney, 1990). [An
important example can be found in the assertions of **water
wars**]{.underline}. Although the management of rivers is often
complicated by their crossing of territorial boundaries and nations
dependent on water from beyond their borders (Egypt, Hungary and
Mauritania all rely on international watercourses for 90 per cent of
their water), [an international conflict **exclusively over** possession
of and access to a shared water source is **still to
occur**]{.underline}. The reasons for this are simply, as Wolf (1998:
251) states, '[[War]{.mark} over water [seems **neither**]{.mark}
**strategically [rational]{.mark}**, **hydrographically
[effective]{.mark}**[, **nor**]{.mark} **economically
[viable]{.mark}**.' At the **international level**, the [costs
**outweigh** ]{.mark}**the benefits** [and coop]{.mark}eration [is
**sought**]{.mark} **before conflict occurs**.]{.underline}

#### Resource wars lit is [ripe]{.underline} with issues -- cost calculations, particularities, and ignoring cities.

**Bayramov 17** -- Agha Bayramov, international relations PhD candidate
at the University of Groningen. \[Review: Dubious nexus between natural
resources and conflict. Journal of Eurasian Studies, 9(1), p. 72-81,

Second, [[less research has scrutinized]{.mark} **political and economic
[costs]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} resources [wars]{.mark}, namely
**[occupation]{.mark} cost**, **[international]{.mark} cost** [and
**investment costs**]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g. Meierding, 2016).
[[The]{.mark} existing [works give **a misleading impression**]{.mark}
that resource [incomes can **cover**]{.mark} **easily**]{.underline}
invasion, investment and international [[costs]{.underline}]{.mark} of
wars. Third, [**the existing [works]{.mark}**
[consider]{.mark}]{.underline} approximately [most resource
[states]{.mark} to be **more or less [equal]{.mark}
entities**]{.underline}. Although such states may have equal rights from
juridical perspective, [[they share]{.mark} **too many [diverse
features]{.mark}**]{.underline} to be considered equal entities
[in]{.underline} other [empirical terms]{.underline}. For example, while
Azerbaijan and Saudi Arabia have rich natural resources, they are
[[dissimilar in]{.mark} **a number of other [important
ways]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However, [**both qualitative and
quantitative [analyses]{.mark}** [neglect this]{.mark} factor [while
explaining]{.mark} **the resource-[conflict]{.mark}
nexus**]{.underline}. Therefore, [[it is unwise to lump]{.mark}
**different [case studies]{.mark}** [together]{.mark} in the same
category [without considering the particular]{.mark}
characteristics]{.underline} of the region or country in question.
Moreover, [wide part of the existing [works adopt]{.mark}s a
[national]{.mark}]{.underline}-level [[approach]{.underline}]{.mark} by
portraying abundancy, scarcity and conflict at the unitary state-level.
Nevertheless, [[natural resources]{.mark} are [distribute]{.mark}d
**[inconsistently over]{.mark} a nation's
[territory]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In other words,
[[only]{.underline}]{.mark} particular places, namely
[[cities]{.underline}]{.mark} or urban areas are [[affected]{.mark}
by]{.underline} the [abundancy or scarcity]{.underline} of resources.
Hence, conflict more likely develops in areas which are excluded from
resource wealth and development. However, [the present [works
neglect]{.mark} **the [distinct]{.mark}ive [character]{.mark}istics**
[between]{.mark} **resource rich cities and nonresource
[cities]{.mark}** [by]{.mark} putting them into **[country level
analysis]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### There's [not enough evidence]{.underline} to prove resources are a [causal factor]{.underline} in conflict.

**Atkins, 16**---PhD Candidate in Energy, Environment & Resilience at

[The historical [ev]{.mark}idence **[fails to support]{.mark} any
arguments** of environmentally driven [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} and
instead provides indications that the environment as an operating cause
is placed within a causal framework where numerous factors intersect.
Within the literature, [[a]{.mark} **confused [perm]{.mark}utation** [of
conflicts involving resources]{.mark} with an economic value and
environmental degradation [results in **misguided conclusions**
regarding]{.mark} the environmental [causality]{.mark} and nature of
many conflicts]{.underline}. Such assumptions result in the neglect of
additional variables that have created a framework in which conflict
takes place. [**Social**, **political** and **economic factors** are
**all important facets** of the process that may **eventually lead to
conflict**. It is these factors that have resulted in minerals in Angola
and Sierra Leone leading to prolonged civil conflicts and unprecedented
violence, and the **same [resources]{.mark}** [resulting in]{.mark}
**relative [peace]{.mark}** [and **growth**]{.mark} in nations such as
Botswana]{.underline}. The landmark [academic [examples of]{.mark} the
role of such [resources in]{.mark} the formation of [conflicts **neglect
key variables**]{.mark} in the occurrence of such struggles. [World War
Two was **not caused** by]{.mark}]{.underline} Adolf Hitler's pursuit of
[**[lebensraum alone]{.mark}**. **Numerous [additional factors]{.mark}**
[provided an]{.mark} **underlying [interplay]{.mark}** that resulted in
the outbreak of war in 1939]{.underline}. This chapter has sought to
illustrate that such a relationship is particularly evident in the
discourse of conflict surrounding environmental migrants and refugees.

[**[Resilience]{.mark}** and [**Adaptation** come to the
rescue]{.mark}:]{.underline}

**[[Decentralized Nature]{.underline}]{.mark}**: As mentioned, [the
decentralized nature of the internet could serve as a
**[safeguard]{.mark}**. Even if [some parts]{.mark} of the network
[falter, others]{.mark} might remain [operational]{.mark}, allowing for
[pockets of connectivity]{.mark} and
[communication]{.mark}.]{.underline}

**[[Offline Alternatives]{.underline}]{.mark}**: The collapse of
centralized online services could lead to a resurgence of offline
communication methods like ham [[radio, **local
networks**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and community bulletin boards.

Unpredictable Future:

[**[Tech]{.mark}nological [Advancements]{.mark}**: Advancements [in
communication]{.mark} technologies [and **network resilience**]{.mark}
in the coming years could significantly [alter]{.mark} the internet\'s
[vulnerability to]{.mark} societal [collapse]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Human Ingenuity: In times of crisis, human ingenuity often shines
through. New solutions and communication methods could emerge, adapting
to the changed landscape and keeping some form of information exchange
alive.

A [Complete Crash is [Highly **Unlikely**]{.mark}]{.underline}While the
internet as we know it today can experience outages, slowdowns and
disruptions, luckily a complete and permanent crash is highly unlikely.

Unlike a single system with one central point of failure, [the internet
is a [vast network of **interconnected computers**]{.mark} and servers
spread [across]{.mark} the [globe]{.mark}. This decentralization makes
it incredibly [resilient]{.mark} to localized issues.]{.underline}

Even if one part of the network goes down, others can still function
independently.

[**[Redundancy and backups]{.mark}**: Critical infrastructure like
internet exchange points and data centers have built-in redundancies to
[ensure **uptime**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

This means that if one component fails, [[another]{.mark} can
**quickly** [take over]{.mark}, minimizing disruptions]{.underline}.
Additionally, [[essential data]{.mark} is often [backed up in **multiple
locations**]{.mark}, further [protecting against **permanent
loss**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Constant **[evolution and adaptation]{.mark}**: The [internet]{.mark}
is [constantly evolving]{.mark}, with [**new technologies** and
protocols]{.mark} emerging [all the time.]{.mark}]{.underline}

This ongoing development helps to address vulnerabilities and improve
overall resilience. [For example, the [development of **mesh networking
technologies**]{.mark} could further [enhance]{.mark} the internet\'s
**[robustness]{.mark}** in the face of disruptions.]{.underline}

By contrast, **[[nothing in digital space is
essential]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to human life. Its various elements
are useful]{.underline}, ubiquitous, seductive,
convenient, [and]{.underline}, in many
cases, [life-enhancing]{.underline}---[but]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** strictly **[necessary]{.underline}**.
How do [we know]{.underline}? [Because]{.underline} [humanity managed
to]{.underline} **[[survive]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and multiply to
nearly 8 billion people]{.underline} and counting, most of them now

the [other]{.underline} **[[elements]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of digital
space.]{.underline}

Moreover, as Bremmer admits, "technology firms cannot decouple
themselves from physical space"; they invariably touch ground in
somebody's sovereign territory. Servers must be located somewhere and
connect to existing power grids. The employees who write algorithms or
answer help lines or fill orders in warehouses must live and work and
eat and sleep in specific locations that are subject to political
authority. Amazon may live in the cloud, but it also depends on fleets
of trucks to deliver merchandise to actual human beings. Even
techno-utopians have to build their survivalist bunkers within the
borders of a real country and in accordance with its zoning laws.

My point is that [it is easy to imagine human life
without]{.underline} the [digital space;]{.underline} [all we have to do
is]{.underline} **[[think
back]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to]{.underline} what [life]{.underline} was
like **[[a few decades]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[ago.]{.underline}** But
trying to imagine human life absent the physical environment in which
humans evolved transports us into the realm of science fiction. If Elon
Musk's fantasies of a Mars colony ever come to fruition (and I'll take
the under on that bet), it will be a remote and tiny outlet dependent on
a steady stream of supplies from Earth and in all probability inhabited
by robots, not people.

None of this is to deny the importance of the digital realm. The world
economy would suffer
significantly [if]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [digital
space]{.underline} **[[collapsed]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[tomorrow]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
we had to go back to snail mail, analog devices, and other pre-digital
ways of doing business, but **[[civilization would not
collapse]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [and]{.underline} [our
species]{.underline} [would]{.underline} probably [**[adapt
quickly]{.mark}**. Some aspects
of]{.underline} contemporary [life]{.underline}---[such
as]{.underline} the level of civility in our [political
discourse]{.underline}---[might]{.underline} [even]{.underline} [**[improve]{.mark}**.]{.underline} If
we destroy the biosphere or other essential features of our physical
space, by contrast, we're toast.

Equally important, today's [digital space is]{.underline} **[[not going
to collapse no matter what]{.underline}]{.mark}** governments decide to
do; [no]{.underline} serious [person wants
to]{.underline} [smash]{.underline} the [servers
and]{.underline} [return]{.underline} us [to]{.underline} [an]{.underline} [analog]{.underline} [world]{.underline}.
The real question is how much and in what ways it will be regulated.
Imposing limits on Google and Apple and Facebook won't drive them out of
business, although it might make them slightly less profitable and slow
the headlong pace of innovation
somewhat. **[[Regulating]{.underline}]{.mark}** the use of artificial
intelligence or other digital tools may reduce some of the benefits of
unfettered technological autonomy, but it **[[won't halt all
progress]{.underline}]{.mark}**. When there are trade-offs between
security and political authority and technological innovation---and
clearly there are---governments (and societies) are likely to accept
somewhat less of the latter to preserve the former.

#### Reshoring now.

Mining\", Mining and Minerals Today, 11-13-2024, accessed 2-13-2025,

//WMK

Trump's Second Term and the Future of US Mining

Donald [Trump's return]{.underline} to the White House in 2024 [has
major implications for US mining]{.underline}. With a Republican
majority in the Senate, [Trump's policies are expected to
reinforce]{.underline} protectionist, **[pro-domestic industry
shifts]{.underline}**, affecting environmental regulation, trade, and
mining permits. [These policies are aimed at strengthening US **mineral
supply chains**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[reducing foreign
reliance]{.underline}**, [especially in **critical minerals essential to
renewable energy** and technology sectors]{.underline}.

[A Republican majority will likely support Trump's vision, prioritizing
**reshoring**]{.underline} over international alliances. However, his
environmental deregulation and potential adjustments to the Inflation
Reduction Act (IRA) could present both opportunities and challenges for
industry players navigating these changes.

A focus on reshoring mineral production

[A central pillar of Trump's policy is reshoring, or **moving mineral
production back to US soil**,]{.underline} a departure from the previous
administration's focus on 'nearshoring' and 'friendshoring'. [Trump's
administration aims to build up the entire **mineral supply chain
domestically** to]{.underline} **[reduce reliance on
imports]{.underline}**, [especially from **China**.]{.underline}

Gregory Wischer, founder of Dei Gratia Minerals, anticipates that
[Trump's administration will prioritize **expanding US-based
extraction**]{.underline}, **[processing]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[refining capabilities]{.underline}**. This approach
[would likely include streamlined **permitting processes**]{.underline}
and targeted tariffs [aimed at **incentivizing domestic mineral
production**]{.underline}, [aligning with Trump's broader focus on
**strengthening America's mineral supply chain**]{.underline}.

While reshoring could create jobs and strengthen supply chains, [it will
require]{.underline} **[significant infrastructure to scale extraction
and processing capabilities]{.underline}**, [as the US currently **lacks
China's extensive production capacity**]{.underline}. Grace Fan of
GlobalData TS Lombard cautions that this reshoring focus may slow
international mining partnerships started under the previous
administration, though the move aligns with Trump's broader goal of US
industrial independence.

Environmental deregulation and mining permitting reform

[Trump's approach]{.underline} to environmental regulation [is expected
to relax standards that affect mining, making it faster and easier to
get new projects approve]{.underline}d. For instance, Trump has already
proposed overturning a 20-year mining moratorium in northern Minnesota,
an area rich in mineral resources. His previous administration also
encouraged regulatory reform to expand uranium mining on federal
lands---a stance expected to extend to other minerals.

Hugues Jacquemin, CEO of Northern Graphite, expects that T[rump's
pro-mining stance will result in faster permitting and more mines in
production]{.underline}. A recent poll by Mining Technology supports
this, with 56% of respondents believing a Republican administration
would accelerate mine licensing.

Eased regulations will appeal to industry leaders eager for growth but
raise environmental concerns. Supporters argue that streamlined
permitting is vital for a competitive minerals market, though
environmental advocates warn of potential ecological harm from reduced
oversight.

Tariff expansions and US-China mineral decoupling

Tariffs remain one of Trump's primary tools for boosting US industries.
His first term saw the beginning of a 'decoupling' strategy with China,
imposing tariffs on Chinese goods, including critical minerals. Trump's
second term will likely continue this trend, perhaps increasing tariffs
on imported minerals essential to sectors like EV batteries.

Currently, China controls about 77% of global graphite production,
creating an imbalance Trump aims to address. Clarice Brambilla, energy
transition analyst at GlobalData, expects that the ongoing US-China
decoupling will continue along its current trajectory, with high tariffs
aimed at reducing reliance on Chinese imports.

Inflation Reduction Act and energy transition

Another major question surrounding Trump's second term is the future of
the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), passed under the previous
administration to support clean energy and critical minerals. Though
Trump's policies favor fossil fuels, he may not fully repeal the IRA due
to existing investments, especially in Republican-led states. Industry
experts also suggest that a Trump administration might scale back
specific provisions, like the \$7,500 EV tax credit, rather than
dismantle the IRA entirely.

Trump's second term is likely to reshape US mining, with deregulatory
policies, tariffs, and reshoring efforts poised to shift the industry's
landscape. [While the drive to reduce foreign reliance could stimulate
domestic production, short-term costs]{.underline} and environmental
concerns [present challenges]{.underline}.

**[In the long run]{.underline}**, [Trump's focus on **mineral
independence and reduced reliance on China could give the US mining
sector a stronger competitive edge**]{.underline}. [However, the
effectiveness of this strategy depends on how quickly the **industry can
expand US-based mining and processing**]{.underline}, adapt to new
regulations, and manage shifting international trade relations.

#### Thumped by Greenland

Charlie **Duxbury 21**, correspondent for Politico EU, 5/7/2021, \"EU's
plan to source rare earths takes a hit in Greenland,\"
<https://www.politico.eu/article/rare-earth-mining-project-greenland-eu-radioactive-uranium/>,
MBA AM

[The]{.underline} EU\'s [plan to secure]{.underline} its [supply of rare
earth metals]{.underline} --- vital for its green transition --- [is
running into trouble in Greenland.]{.underline}

[A [new]{.mark} two-party coalition [government]{.mark}]{.underline} on
the autonomous Danish territory [is [planning to **stop**]{.mark} one of
the world's biggest **[rare earth mining]{.mark}** projects over fears
that **radioactive [uranium]{.mark}**, which [is]{.mark}]{.underline}
also [[**present** in the deposit]{.mark}, could damage the **local
environment**.]{.underline}

The prospect that [[the mine]{.underline}]{.mark}, known as Kuannersuit,
could be [[shut down is **a heavy blow**]{.mark} to the]{.underline}
EU\'s [**long-term plan** to source more rare earth metals]{.underline}
--- which are key to the production of a range of green technology from
electric cars to wind turbines --- [from]{.underline} politically stable
[Western-aligned countries.]{.underline}

The EU is increasingly concerned that relying on China, which sources
the bulk of \"critical\" raw materials --- those defined as economically
important and with high supply risk --- is unwise among ongoing
diplomatic tensions between Brussels and Beijing.

["The new coalition does not support uranium mining,"]{.underline} Naaja
Hjelholt Nathanielsen, Greenland\'s new minister of mining, told
POLITICO.

[[Her party]{.underline}]{.mark}, Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA), [[made
**scrapping** the]{.mark} **rare earth [mine]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
uranium [**[central]{.mark}** to its campaign]{.underline} ahead of last
month\'s election. And [following its win]{.underline} at the ballot
box, [it is widely expected to make good on that promise.]{.underline}

Nathanielsen said she has yet to meet with Greenland Minerals, the
Australia-based company developing the mine, but she expects the
government will make an announcement about the project "before summer."
The proposal is currently subject to a public hearing that is scheduled
to end June 1.

"I suppose [they will stop the project]{.underline}," said Erik Jensen,
the leader of the Siumut party, which came second and lost power in the
April election. [His party has long backed the mine, but it too has
cooled on the project in recent months.]{.underline}

"We are neutral in the issue right now because we would like to first
see the hearing process and what the geologists have said about the
project," Jensen said.

#### China won't restrict supply

US,"
https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/chinese-behemoths-what-chinas-rare-earths-dominance-means-us,
SRB)

[[Chinese officials are]{.underline}]{.mark} highly [[**conscious**
of]{.mark} the **geopolitical advantage**]{.underline} [they derive
**from** their **[REE dominance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [2010
incident]{.underline} over REE shipments to Japan [was a wake-up call to
import-dependent customers]{.underline}. Almost a decade later [in 2019,
threats of restricted supply returned]{.underline}.\[65\] [Xi's
visit]{.underline} to a REE magnet production facility in Ganzhou in
2019 [was widely regarded as a sign that restricting REE supply is on
the table]{.underline}.\[66\] A week later, [the People's Daily
posted]{.underline} an article explicitly threatening that if "the U.S.
side wants to use the products made by China's exported rare earths to
counter and suppress China's development," [the U.S. should not
"underestimate the Chinese side's ability to safeguard its development
rights and interests]{.underline}."\[67\] The more recent [**MIIT [draft
controls]{.mark}** list proposed in January 2021 also [suggest]{.mark}s
that **[international policy responses]{.mark}** significantly
[influence]{.mark} Chinese domestic **[policies toward rare
earths]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\[68\] [Officials in [Beijing]{.mark} are
particularly [focused on how quickly the **U.S. would secure
alternatives**]{.mark} [if REE were included on the control
list.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Therein lies a paradox: [China's state-supported [rare earth
enterprises]{.mark} remain [at the **behest of international market**
dynamics]{.mark}]{.underline}. Overburdening [[policy changes]{.mark}
and perceived supply insecurity would [push buyers away from Chinese
suppliers]{.mark}.]{.underline} Any restrictive moves would likely
[spur]{.underline} proactive value chain [restructuring **away from
Chinese REE**]{.underline}. Therefore, [[Chinese officials]{.mark} would
be **[unlikely to directly restrict trade for political
reasons]{.mark}**]{.underline} and calls for such are [primarily [just
**sword rattling**]{.mark} to disguise domestic policies and production
controls]{.underline} that bear a more long-term effect on supply coming
out of China.

#### [NO IMPACT]{.underline}: **REEs small, embargos circumvented, inventory shock absorbs, schedule disruptions inevitable.** 

**Gholz, 14** \-\-- associate professor at the Lyndon B. Johnson School
of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin (October 2014,
Eugene, "ENERGY REPORT; Rare Earth Elements and National Security,"
https://www.cfr.org/sites/default/files/pdf/2014/10/Energy%20Report_Gholz.pdf,
JMP))

This leaves one area of lingering concern around REE supplies: the role
of [[REEs]{.underline} [in defense production]{.underline}]{.mark},
where market behavior is less relevant. The volumes [used in defense
production [turn out]{.mark} to be **relatively small**.]{.underline}51
[The percentage of total American consumption used in defense products
differs from element to element, but for most rare earths, estimates put
the number at **[well under 10 percent of U.S.
demand]{.mark}**]{.underline}---again, [an amount [that can]{.mark}
probably [be acquired through]{.mark} various methods of
**[circumventing an embargo]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Moreover, [[with
U.S. production back]{.mark} in line [at]{.mark} the [Mountain
Pass]{.mark} mine and factories in the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [producing at all
stages of the supply chain, the **U.S. [defense]{.mark} market [has much
more flexibility]{.mark}** today than it did at the low
point]{.underline} between 2002 and 2009. And perhaps [more important,
the [defense]{.mark} market [can]{.mark} probably **[accept]{.mark} some
[delays]{.mark}** in delivery of rare earth components]{.underline}.
[[Interruption]{.underline}]{.mark} of rare earth supplies [[will
only]{.mark} have]{.underline} immediate [[effect]{.mark}s on
[production]{.mark} [if the supply chain]{.mark} **[does not include
privately owned inventories]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [even under modern
lean production strategies, most manufacturers and some brokers keep
enough [inventory]{.mark} on hand that [can act as]{.mark} [a]{.mark}
**partial [shock absorber]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And **[even
if]{.underline}** [inventories are insufficient and a rare earth supply
interruption knocks a weapons program off schedule, the [defense]{.mark}
acquisition system [is **used to** ]{.mark}**schedule
[disruptions]{.mark}**]{.underline}; disruptions often bring some
financial costs, but for many reasons, [they are a]{.underline} sadly
[well-understood fact of life in defense]{.underline}.52 Moreover, [a
supply [interruption]{.mark} [cannot affect]{.mark} the [existing
weapons]{.mark} inventory]{.underline}. Unlike fears that Chinese
electronics used in weapon systems might include Trojan horses or
backdoors that would cede military advantage to the Chinese in a crisis,
[the rare earth [magnets]{.mark}, [lasers]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} other
[tech]{.mark}nologies [built in]{.mark}to [already]{.mark}-deployed
American weapons [would still work]{.mark} perfectly well even if those
components had been imported from China and **[even if follow-on imports
were interrupted]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Thinking carefully through the
disruption scenario, [dependence on imported rare earth products brings
less national security risk than originally feared]{.underline}.

[[The Arctic 7 must **bridge diverging national views** on]{.mark}
circumpolar [security]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[If]{.underline}]{.mark}
all Arctic [[NATO]{.mark} countries]{.underline} now
[[recognize]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[Russia represents a security
threat]{.mark} to the region]{.underline}, [[they **lack an integrated
view**]{.underline}]{.mark} on what constitutes defense and security
priorities within that threat environment.36

For instance, [[Russia as a]{.mark} **circumpolar security
[threat]{.mark}** [conveys a different meaning]{.mark} and response
[between the **European Arctic** and the **North
American**]{.mark}/North Pacific **[Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}.44
[Arctic security [in Nordic countries]{.mark}, especially in Finland and
Sweden, [is a matter of **territorial defense**]{.mark} and a
prerequisite for national security.]{.underline}

[Geography also matters]{.underline}: [[The definition of the "Arctic"
diverges]{.mark} from a Canadian, American, Danish, or Finnish point of
view.]{.underline} While [[Sweden and Finland focus]{.mark}]{.underline}
as much [[on Baltic]{.mark} Sea [and Lapland
security]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [US and Canadian]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[defense focus]{.mark} remains]{.underline} circumscribed [[within
NORAD]{.mark}'s AoR.]{.underline} Yet, the [US and Canada also have
**different approaches**]{.underline} to security in the North American
Arctic --- [[**military focused** for the US and "**defense centric**"
for Canada]{.underline}]{.mark}.75

[T[he Arctic 7 must **avoid a bifurcation**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[between the North American NORAD-centric Arctic and the European High
North]{.underline}. Thankfully, Arctic allies have strong
complementarities --- for instance, Norway's naval focus; Finland's land
presence and ground forces; and North America's air defense, air power,
remote sensing, and space operations.

A second paramount factor is [the [need to **obtain a common
understanding** of what represents]{.mark} acceptable, legitimate, and
**nonthreatening [military operations]{.mark}** at peacetime [in the
region]{.mark}]{.underline}. This could be achieved by creating an
Arctic Military Code of Conduct (AMCC).76 By defining the rules of the
road of peacetime military activity, an AMCC would help diffuse tension
and limit the risk of miscalculation. The AMCC should be extended to
Russia and to all non-coastal states able to deploy and sustain military
assets in the Arctic (which would undeniably include China).77

The AMCC would increase transparency and predictability in regional
military security affairs. In terms of format, a code of conduct should
remain light and noninvasive enough to avoid over-institutionalizing
military security affairs in the Arctic.

strategies [from the US allies revealed **conflicting
facts**]{.mark}]{.underline} and theses [[that do not align with]{.mark}
**collective [interests]{.mark}** in the region]{.underline}. For
example, [[Canada\'s]{.mark} [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} and Northern
Policy [[Framework]{.underline}]{.mark} (Government of Canada, 2019)
[[emphasizes]{.mark} Canada\'s]{.underline} enduring

**security [cooperation]{.mark}** [without]{.mark}]{.underline} explicit
[reference to [NATO]{.mark}.]{.underline} Canada\'s Arctic and Northern
Policy Framework (Government of Canada, 2019) [also highlights the

[to]{.mark}]{.underline} outstanding [**[border disputes]{.underline}**,
[including the disagreement with the U]{.underline}]{.mark}[nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} [[over the]{.underline}]{.mark} status of
the [[Northwest Passage]{.mark}, which Canada considers "inland waters"
while the US regards it as an international strait]{.underline} through

The next factor that has the potential to create divisions among

[[Canada\'s submission to]{.underline}]{.mark} the United Nations
Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf
([[CLCS]{.underline}]{.mark}) on May 23, 2019, [[highlights **competing
claims**]{.mark} not only [from Russia]{.mark} but also from
[Denmark]{.mark}]{.underline}. As an Arctic state due to Greenland, the
Kingdom of [[Denmark asserts its **claim to an
area**]{.underline}]{.mark} of \~895,000 km2 [in the Arctic
Ocean]{.underline}, [a significant portion of [which **overlaps

[The [economic interests of]{.mark} Arctic [allies]{.mark}
can]{.underline} sometimes [**[pose strategic risks]{.mark}** and
threats [to]{.mark} **collective [security
interests]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Foreign
[investments]{.mark}]{.underline}, particularly [[from
China]{.underline}]{.mark}, [in]{.underline} certain [countries within
the region have reached a]{.underline} [level where they [can
**influence the policies**]{.mark} of those countries]{.underline}.
[[This]{.mark} influence [is]{.mark}]{.underline} often [[achieved by
investing in]{.underline}]{.mark} sensitive and [[strategic]{.mark}
[sectors]{.mark}]{.underline}. [An example]{.underline} of this [is the
Chinese investments in **mining projects in Greenland**]{.underline}
over the past decade. In 2017, [the Prime Minister of Greenland visited
China to **attract investments, which led to China making a bid** for
the airport]{.underline} (Auerswald, 2019). The [**[growing Chinese
influence]{.mark}** in Greenland **has [raised concerns]{.mark}** [for
the United States]{.mark}]{.underline}, [as it **affects the US
interests** in the region]{.underline}. [Imposing restrictions on
Chinese investments]{.underline} may [only be feasible if Greenland can
find alternative sources of income]{.underline}. Consequently,
Greenland\'s appeal for Chinese investors and construction companies to
help expand its airports has prompted Denmark and the US to
strategically invest in infrastructure development on the island (Conley
and Wall, 2021). According to Pincus and Berbrick (2018), this [Chinese
interest]{.underline} in Greenland [presents two concerns for the United
States]{.underline}. [[Firstly, many]{.underline}]{.mark} of the
[[facilities]{.underline}]{.mark} attracting Chinese investments [have
**dual-use capabilities**]{.underline}, [which means they
[could]{.mark}]{.underline} potentially [[be utilized as part of
**Chinese military**]{.mark} **[infrastructure]{.mark}** in the
Arctic,]{.underline} such as refueling stations for warships.
[[Secondly]{.mark}, due to the small size of Greenland\'s economy,
[Chinese companies can]{.mark}]{.underline} easily [**[hold a]{.mark}
substantial [portion]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the island\'s [economic
activity]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[providing]{.mark} China with
[leverage]{.mark}]{.underline}** to pursue military and political
interests, [including interfering with American presence]{.underline}
(Pincus and Berbrick, 2018). [China also has close relations with
Iceland]{.underline}. This is demonstrated by the Icelandic-Chinese Free
Trade Agreement signed in 2013 and the establishment of the Arctic
Circle Conference, which China actively participates in. China has a
significant diplomatic presence in Iceland [and **collaborates on**
research **projects**]{.underline} (Olesen and Sorensen, 2019).

Furthermore, [[another factor]{.underline}]{.mark} that cannot be
overlooked [[is the **shared state borders**]{.mark} of some Arctic
allies [with]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[Russia]{.underline}n]{.mark}
Federation. [The Arctic [allies that have a common border]{.mark} with
Russia [face]{.mark}]{.underline} specific [**[military
risks]{.mark}**,]{.underline} [[which]{.underline}]{.mark} can [[act as
a **divisive factor**]{.underline}]{.mark} within the alliance.
[Proximity to Russian military]{.underline} installations also [[creates
**security concerns**]{.mark} that require **individual
responses**]{.underline}. [[Finland and Sweden]{.underline}]{.mark}, for
instance, [remained outside of the alliance until the onset of the
Russian-Ukrainian conflict]{.underline} due to concerns about potential
Russian responses. Additionally, [their [membership within NATO
complicates defense planning]{.mark}]{.underline}, given that [both
countries are]{.underline} [within range of]{.underline} various
**[Russian military systems]{.underline}**, and [Finland shares a border
with Russia]{.underline} spanning \~1,340 km. [[The complex]{.mark}
legal [status o]{.mark}f]{.underline} the Norwegian island of
[[Svalbard]{.underline}]{.mark} also [presents a vulnerability that may
**[attract malicious actors]{.mark}** employing hybrid
tactics]{.underline} (Conley and Wall, 2021). For example, [the [Chinese

[Canada]{.underline} is [seeing **rising tensions**]{.underline} on its
southern border. While calls from the current US administration to make
Canada the 51st state draw the public's attention, [there is
another]{.underline} [border]{.underline} [that]{.underline} has seemed
to [slip the minds of most]{.underline} Canadians: **[the
Arctic.]{.underline}**

[[Canada and Russia **share a border** through the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, which has [proven to be
**problematic**]{.underline} ever [since Russia's invasion of
**Ukraine**]{.underline}. Russia's imperialistic actions in Ukraine show
that its national agenda is one of aggressive expansion; sharing a
border with such a state exposes bordering nations to similar
imperialistic ambitions. As such, [[Canada should]{.mark} be seriously
considering [improv]{.mark}ing]{.underline} its [**[Arctic
defences]{.mark}** not only [to]{.mark} counter Russia]{.underline},
[but to also]{.underline} [[assist in **NATO's**]{.underline}]{.mark}
broader [[defence]{.mark} strategy]{.underline}.

The Arctic is an area of the world that represents a unique security
challenge. As it is warming two to three times faster than any other
place on the planet, causing the loss of millions of tons of ice. Brown
University notes that the melting of the ice in the Arctic provides a
new opportunity for international trade. [Russia]{.underline} has
[maintained]{.underline} a [tight hold on the shipping lanes in the
Arctic]{.underline}, requiring that ships be piloted by Russians and
that ships pay a toll. With the number of ships moving through the
Arctic increasing, this means that Russia is gaining more from these
tolls. As such, Russia has been able to use the Arctic to improve both
its economic and security position. However, this will all soon change.

With the melting of the Arctic, scholars say that [new trade
routes]{.underline} [will]{.underline} open up [threatening]{.underline}
[Russia's control of the region]{.underline}, [meaning [Canada should
**prepare for** ]{.mark}**an [increase in activity]{.mark}**
there]{.underline}.

On December 6th, 2024, Global Affairs Canada released a press release
outlining a plan to protect the Arctic from encroachment by foreign
entities. [One]{.underline} of these [steps in defending
the]{.underline} [Arctic is to [deepen]{.mark}]{.underline} [**strategic
[alliances]{.mark}** [with the US]{.mark}A]{.underline} and Denmark, who
also have significant holdings in the Arctic. [Canada]{.underline}
[strengthening]{.underline} its [ties with the USA]{.underline} in the
Arctic [is]{.underline} especially [advantageous]{.underline}, [as
[NORAD]{.mark}]{.underline} has [[protected]{.mark} the Arctic
**[since]{.mark} its [inception]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[through]{.underline} the use of [airtime and maritime warning
systems]{.underline}. [Yet, [it requires
**modernization**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as noted by a paper released by
the Canadian Forces College entitled "Frozen Frontlines: Evaluating the
Strategic Importance of NORAD Modernization on Arctic Sovereignty."
However, current relations between the two countries pose a significant
obstacle to cooperation which is stalling the changes needed to improve
each navy's ability to guard the Arctic.

[Russia's [testing of **NORAD**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and Arctic
defenses]{.underline} only [[speaks]{.underline}
[to]{.underline}]{.mark} the [increased [need for
**cooperation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The U.S. and Canada's waning
influence in the Arctic will only result in Russia emboldening its
actions there. With the USA's foreign policy in disarray, it falls to
Canada and Denmark to secure the Arctic.

Denmark has already promised to boost spending on defence in the region
by providing \$2.05 billion USD in funding. While this is in response to
Russia's actions in the Arctic, it is also the result of calls from the
USA to annex Greenland. Individually, Canada, Greenland, and Denmark all
have strategic interests in protecting the Arctic.

Such self-interest in [national strategy]{.underline} then [serves
NATO.]{.underline} By capitalizing on this concern, [[NATO could
improve]{.mark} Arctic defence for]{.underline} its [members as well as
increase **[interoperability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. By doing this, not
only would each nation be serving its national interest but also
supporting NATO.

[With multiple Russian aerial incursions]{.underline} [in the
Arctic]{.underline}, and with NORAD in a seemingly precarious position
with the current dispute between Canada and the USA, [it is [crucial
that]{.mark}]{.underline} [[NATO]{.underline} [begin **force
projection**]{.underline}]{.mark} [operations]{.underline} [in the
Arctic [to deter Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}. [NATO]{.underline} has
[already started]{.underline} this projection specifically [with Nordic
Countries]{.underline}, recently including support from other NATO
nations such as Canada, the USA, and the U.K.

Not only does [this help]{.underline} to [[demonstrate]{.underline}
**[NATO's commitment]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[defence of]{.underline} its [[members]{.underline}]{.mark} [but
also]{.underline} the [**practicality** of
**interoperability**]{.underline}, defined as "the ability for
\[a\]llies to act together coherently, effectively and efficiently to
achieve tactical, operational and strategic objectives." It can do this
through the use of its Standing NATO Maritime Groups which is composed
of some vessels from each member nation.

While NATO's Maritime Command (MARCOM) is currently engaged in
activities in the Mediterranean through Operation Sea Guardian, it has
the opportunity to initiate another [operation in the
Arctic]{.underline}. Such an opportunity would not only serve to
[demonstrate]{.underline} the [strength of the **alliance's members**
but also]{.underline} [[assist in deterring]{.underline}]{.mark}
[Russia]{.underline} [from]{.underline} [undertaking]{.underline} any
more **[[provocative actions]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the Arctic.

[[Canada can]{.underline}]{.mark} not only [support NATO by]{.underline}
[[invest]{.mark}ing [more]{.mark}]{.underline} [[in Arctic
defence]{.mark} but]{.underline} it [[can]{.mark} also **[protect
itself]{.mark}**]{.underline}. So long as climate change rages, [the
Arctic will]{.underline} [continue to be a **battleground** for the
**world's superpowers**]{.underline}. The economic potential of the
region makes it a valuable asset to any nation that maintains a strong
presence there. Russia is seeking to control as many of those assets as
possible to fuel its imperialistic agenda. As such, [[**Canada**
and]{.mark} other **[NATO]{.mark} allies** [have a **duty** to work
towards]{.mark}]{.underline} [not only [individual]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[investment]{.underline}]{.mark} in Arctic defence [[but
also]{.underline}]{.mark} in [[advocating]{.underline} [that

[[involvement]{.underline}]{.mark} [in its Arctic
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} indeed **[[thawing]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In a

74 percent supported private-public cooperation. Prime Minister Mark
Carney\'s recent overtures to join the European Union\'s "ReArm Europe"
initiative suggest that Canada is trying to fulfill this promise.

The University of British Columbia\'s Michael Byers has suggested that
[[Canada]{.underline} [could welcome]{.underline}]{.mark} [a
more]{.underline} **[persistent]{.underline}** [[NATO]{.mark} presence
[through]{.mark}]{.underline} [increasing Arctic **[exercise

[A 2022 study]{.underline} similarly [proposed]{.underline} that [Canada

[[U.S.-Germany]{.mark} Collaboration]{.underline} in Arctic and High
North Security: A Strategic Partnership within the Trans-Atlantic
Alliance

Abstract

Rooted in NATO's collective defense framework, [their [partnership
strengthens **deterrence** against Russian]{.mark} militarization [and
Chinese expansionism]{.mark} through joint military exercises, maritime
operations, and infrastructure protection]{.underline}. Economically,
[they **align** to [secure]{.mark} critical [minerals and]{.mark}
maintain open sea [lanes]{.mark}, [**essential** for]{.mark}
transatlantic **prosperity**]{.underline}. Diplomatically, [they
advocate for [a rules-based **order**]{.mark} through the Arctic Council
and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
(UNCLOS)]{.underline}. This analysis underscores that
[U.S.-[Germany]{.mark} cooperation [is a **linchpin** for Arctic
stability]{.mark}, blending military prowess, economic strategy, and
governance leadership to **safeguard** a region increasingly vital to
global **security** and **sustainability**]{.underline}.

This article examines and urges the strengthening of strategic
collaboration between the United States and Germany in the High North,
exploring how [[the U.S. and Germany could **jointly** address]{.mark}
military presence, governance, and economic dimensions of
[Arctic]{.mark} security]{.underline}. It begins by exploring their
military contributions, anchored in NATO and bilateral initiatives,
which enhance deterrence and operational readiness in the European High
North and the broader Arctic region. It then analyzes their governance
efforts, which promote a rules-based order through international
institutions and bilateral dialogues. Finally, it assesses their
economic strategies, from securing critical supply chains to fostering
sustainable trade routes. The discussion recommends that [this alliance
is not merely a tactical necessity but a **strategic cornerstone**,
[shaping the Arctic's future and reinforcing]{.mark} transatlantic
[unity]{.mark} in an era of global uncertainty]{.underline}.

Introduction

The Arctic, long perceived as a remote and inhospitable expanse, has
undergone a dramatic transformation in recent decades. Sea ice retreat
has unlocked vast economic opportunities, new shipping routes, untapped
energy reserves, and critical mineral deposits while simultaneously
exposing the region to heightened geopolitical risks. [For the United
States, an Arctic nation through Alaska, the High North represents both
a strategic asset and a vulnerability, necessitating a robust and
collaborative approach to its security]{.underline}. Though lacking
Arctic territory, [[Germany]{.mark} has emerged as an
**[indispensable]{.mark} partner** in this endeavor, [leveraging]{.mark}
its status in [NATO]{.mark}, a leader in the European Union (EU), and a
close U.S. ally to contribute to regional stability]{.underline}.

This [[partnership]{.mark} has [**gained urgency** in the wake
of]{.mark} Russia's 2022 invasion of **[Ukraine]{.mark}** and China's
expanding Arctic ambitions]{.underline}, events that have reshaped the
security landscape of the Arctic. [Germany's policy shift]{.underline},
encapsulated in the 2022 "Zeitenwende" (times-turn or turning point),
has [broadened its usual scientific and environmental focus in the
Arctic to emphasize energy, defense, and security, aligning closely with
U.S. objectives]{.underline}. The U.S., meanwhile, views the Arctic as a
critical component of its national security (White House, 2025), with
the Department of Defense identifying it as a potential theater for
great power competition (U.S. Department of Defense, 2021). Together,
these nations are fortifying transatlantic resilience through joint
patrols with US and Nordic allies in key areas like the GIUK gap,
countering emerging threats from Russia's militarized Arctic bases to
China's investments in infrastructure and shipping.

[[The **stakes**]{.mark} in the Arctic [are
immense]{.mark}]{.underline}. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that
the region contains 13% of the world's undiscovered oil, 30% of its
undiscovered natural gas, and significant reserves of rare earth
elements critical for advanced technologies (Gautier et al., 2009). New
maritime routes, such as the Trans-Arctic Route (TSR), could reduce
shipping times by 50% (Bennett et al, 2020), and the Northern Sea Route
(NSR) promises to cut shipping times between Europe and Asia by up to
40%, reshaping global trade dynamics (Humpert, 2014). However,
[**risks** shadow these opportunities, and actual savings depend on
future ice conditions and navigational feasibility, with potential
variations due to operational challenges. [Russia]{.mark} understands
the value of the Arctic and has bolstered its Arctic presence with
advanced missile systems and submarines and reopened Soviet-era bases,
**[threatening NATO]{.mark}**'s northern and western flanks]{.underline}
(Pezard et al., 2020). Hoping to gain a foothold in the Arctic,
[[China]{.mark} has pursued economic projects like the Polar Silk Road,
[raising concerns]{.mark} about its long-term intentions]{.underline}
(Lanteigne, 2014). In this complex environment, [U.S.-[Germany
collaboration offers a]{.mark} **multifaceted [response]{.mark}**,
integrating military cooperation, economic alignment, and diplomatic
leadership to ensure the Arctic remains a zone of **stability** rather
than conflict]{.underline}.

Germany's role, while distinct from that of Arctic states, is grounded
in its strategic position within NATO and the EU. Historically, Berlin's
Arctic engagement focused on scientific research, exemplified by
initiatives like the MOSAiC expedition, which advanced global
understanding of climate dynamics (Alfred Wegener Institute, 2020).
However, the Zeitenwende has marked a turning point, with
[[Germany's]{.underline}]{.mark} 2023 National Security Strategy
[[**explicitly framing** Arctic stability as a]{.mark} NATO [priority
and pledging enhanced cooperation]{.mark} with Arctic
allies]{.underline} (Federal Foreign Office, 2023).

This shift recognizes that [[developments]{.mark} in the High
North]{.underline}, whether Russian naval activity in the
Greenland-Iceland-UK (GIUK) gap or Chinese investments in Greenland,
[[directly impact]{.mark} European and transatlantic [security]{.mark}.
For the U.S., [Germany's contributions **strengthen** the]{.mark}
transatlantic [alliance, **directly supporting**]{.mark} America's
[interests]{.mark} by providing logistical support, maritime
capabilities, and diplomatic weight in the Arctic -- a region critical
to US security, where **[acting alone isn't
enough]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Moreover, [[Germany can **leverage** its
**proximity**]{.mark} and E.U. influence [to shape policy]{.mark} and
economic engagement in the European Arctic, such as fostering
sustainable development or countering Chinese infrastructure bids, [in a
way the U.S.]{.mark}, as a non-E.U. power geographically distant from
the region, [cannot]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Military, Governance, and Economic Dimensions of U.S.-Germany
Collaboration

The U.S.-Germany partnership in the Arctic operates across three
interlocking domains: military cooperation, governance and policy, and
economic strategy. Each dimension reflects a shared commitment to
countering threats, seizing opportunities, and upholding a stable,
rules-based order in the High North.

Strengthening NATO's Northern and Western Flanks

[At the heart of U.S.-Germany military collaboration lies their shared
commitment to NATO, which has designated the Arctic and North Atlantic
as critical theaters for collective defense. The U.S. brings
unparalleled Arctic expertise through its Alaskan bases, Coast Guard
icebreakers, and Northern Command, while [**Germany**
contributes]{.mark} maritime and logistical [capabilities that **enhance
NATO's reach**]{.mark}. Russia's militarization of the
Arctic]{.underline}, evidenced by its deployment of S-400 missile
systems and nuclear submarines along the Kola Peninsula, has [heightened
the need for a **robust** allied **presence**]{.underline} (Conley et
al., 2020). Joint exercises like NATO's 2018 Trident Juncture, conducted
in northern Norway with 50,000 troops, showcased this synergy, [with
[German infrastructure facilitating]{.mark} the rapid [deployment of
U.S.]{.mark} and allied [forces]{.mark}]{.underline} (NATO, 2018).
Similarly, the 2022 Cold Response exercise saw German naval and air
units train alongside 26 NATO nations in Arctic conditions, refining
their interoperability in extreme environments (NATO, 2022).

[Germany's maritime contributions are particularly
significant]{.underline}. The German Navy has shifted focus to the North
Atlantic and Arctic-adjacent waters, patrolling key gaps and seams like
the GIUK gap alongside U.S. and Nordic allies. Following the 2022 Nord
Stream pipeline sabotage, Germany deployed [frigates and supply ships to
Norwegian waters to protect critical infrastructure, including oil rigs
and undersea cables, underscoring its role in NATO's deterrence
**posture**]{.underline} (Arctic Today, 2022). Bilaterally, Germany and
Norway are collaborating on a new and improved submarine, the Type
U212CD, a stealth vessel designed for Arctic operations, with delivery
expected by 2029 (Thales, 2023). In 2024, the German Navy's U-36
submarine participated in Exercise Arctic Dolphin, a multinational
anti-submarine warfare drill off Norway, enhancing NATO's ability to
counter Russian underwater threats (Navy Leaders, 2025).

The U.S. complements these efforts with its deployments, including P-8
Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft and Virginia-class submarines, which
monitor Russian naval movements in the Arctic Ocean (U.S. Department of
Defense, 2021). Germany is set to bolster this capability by acquiring
P-8 Poseidons, replacing aging P-3C Orions, and aligning its
anti-submarine warfare capacity with U.S. standards (Federal Foreign
Office, 2023). On land, Germany's hosting of NATO's Joint Support and
Enabling Command in Ulm ensures rapid reinforcement of the High North
during crises, a role tested in exercises like Trident Juncture (NATO,
2018). Looking forward, Germany's 2023 National Security Strategy
commits to designating Bundeswehr units for Arctic duties and expanding
cold-weather training, reflecting a long-term investment in High North
security (Federal Foreign Office, 2023).

Upholding a Rules-Based Order

Beyond military power, [U.S.-Germany collaboration extends to
governance, where both nations advocate for a **multilateral framework**
to manage Arctic challenges. The U.S., as an Arctic Council member, and
[Germany]{.mark}]{.underline}, an observer since 1998, [[view the
Council as a **cornerstone** for **dialogue**]{.mark} and
cooperation]{.underline} (Federal Foreign Office, 2019).
[Germany's]{.underline} 2023 [Arctic Policy Guidelines emphasize working
"closely with allies and partners to guarantee security and
stability,"]{.underline} primarily through NATO and the EU (Federal
Foreign Office, 2023). Both nations staunchly endorse UNCLOS as the
legal bedrock for Arctic governance, advocating its use to resolve
territorial disputes and regulate maritime activities, a stance critical
amid overlapping claims in the central Arctic Ocean (Federal Foreign
Office, 2023). Germany has shaped a unified Arctic policy within the EU,
influencing the 2021 EU Arctic Strategy's focus on sustainability and
opposition to unregulated resource extraction (European Commission,
2021). Berlin's advocacy for an Arctic oil and gas drilling ban, aligned
with Paris Agreement goals, has sparked debate but underscores its
environmental concerns (High North News, 2023). Washington's focus is on
energy and national security interests to strengthen the United States
and its alliance (Rosen, 2025; DeVore, 2025). Post-2022, both nations
joined the other seven Arctic states in suspending cooperation with
Russia in the Council, redirecting efforts toward "like-minded partners"
to sustain governance initiatives (Østhagen, 2024).

Germany's participation in forums like the Arctic Security Forces
Roundtable and its observer status at Nordic Chiefs of Defense meetings
further deepen its governance role (U.S. European Command, 2023). It
promotes confidence-building measures, such as the Arctic Coast Guard
Forum and the Polar Code, while voicing concerns about Russia's military
buildup and China's ambitions through diplomatic channels (Federal
Foreign Office, 2023). The U.S., meanwhile, leads efforts to integrate
Finland and Sweden into NATO's Arctic framework, a process Germany
supports through logistical and political backing (Federal Foreign
Office, 2023). [Together, they foster a governance model prioritizing
peace, sustainability, and cooperation over confrontation]{.underline}.

Securing Resources and Trade Routes

Economically, [the U.S. and Germany align to harness the Arctic's
potential while **mitigating** its **risks**]{.underline}. The region's
critical minerals, rare earths, cobalt, and nickel are vital for their
high-tech economies, with Greenland and Northern Canada emerging as key
sources (Hammond, 2023). The 2022 Minerals Security Partnership (MSP), a
U.S.-led coalition including Germany, targets "friend-shoring" these
resources with Arctic allies to counter China's dominance in the rare
earth market (Reuters, 2022). Germany's 2023 Arctic Policy Guidelines
highlight this as a priority, with joint U.S.-Germany funding supporting
mining ventures in Greenland that adhere to high environmental standards
(Pulitzer Center, 2022).

[**Shipping routes** like [the NSR]{.mark} offer another economic
frontier. For Germany, a trading nation, these lanes could [elevate
Hamburg as a **global hub**]{.mark}, while the U.S. seeks to ensure
freedom of navigation]{.underline} (Humpert, 2014). Both nations insist
these routes remain open and governed by UNCLOS, with Germany pioneering
green ice-class vessels to meet strict environmental standards (Federal
Foreign Office, 2023). In energy, Germany has shifted to Norwegian
Arctic gas following the curtailment of Russian imports. At the same
time, the U.S. is exploring an all-energy sources solution, such as oil
leasing in Arctic waters off Alaska, prioritizing energy security and
economic development (Alaska Beacon, 2025). Naval deployments, including
Germany's P-8 Poseidon investments and U.S. Coast Guard patrols, secure
these sea lanes, particularly after the 2022 pipeline attacks heightened
infrastructure vulnerabilities (Gosnell & Thomas, 2024).

Conclusion

[The U.S.-Germany partnership in the Arctic is a testament to the
**power** of transatlantic cooperation in addressing the region's
multifaceted challenges]{.underline}. Militarily, [their NATO-based
**collaboration** deters aggression, protects infrastructure, and
ensures readiness in a contested domain]{.underline}. In governance,
[their advocacy for a rules-based order through the Arctic Council,
UNCLOS, and the EU **counters** destabilizing **influences**, promoting
stability and sustainability]{.underline}. Economically, [their
alignment secures critical resources and trade routes, reinforcing
transatlantic prosperity amid global competition. As the Arctic's
strategic importance grows, this alliance serves as a vital anchor,
transforming a region of risk into one of opportunity.]{.underline} Far
from being short-term and expedient, the multi-decadal U.S.-Germany
collaboration in the Arctic is a long-term strategic endeavor,
safeguarding the Arctic and supporting global security and resilience.
[As the Federal Republic of [Germany]{.mark} plans its **future
investments** in defense and security, **it [should consider the
Arctic]{.mark}**, a region of growing strategic importance, [to further
**expand** and **enhance** its contributions]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### [One instance]{.underline} is key to [empower]{.underline} German ['minilateralism']{.underline}, revitalizing [middle power]{.underline} status and catalyzing [allied follow-on]{.underline}.

\[TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMMITTED\]

A new government with bold ambitions The centre-right Christian
Democratic Union (CDU), led by Friedrich Merz, won Germany's federal
elections on 23 February 2025. A coalition agreement with the Social
Democrats was reached in early April, but under Germany's procedural
norms, the government was only sworn in on 6 May. In the interim, the
outgoing administration continued to manage daily affairs, but the
incoming leadership has already begun shaping the country's strategic
direction, with key decisions being made. In a move that would have been
unimaginable even a year ago, Germany passed a constitutional amendment
to loosen its strict debt limits and permit massive defence and security
spending. That such a far-reaching decision was made by the outgoing
parliament and supported by the interim government only underscores the
urgency felt across the political spectrum. Dismantling a fiscal taboo
-- building new governance structures Germany's "debt brake," enshrined
in the constitution by the Conservatives in 2009, has long symbolised
the country's commitment to fiscal austerity. In late March 2025, this
constraint was partially suspended, with the aim to exclude from debt
calculations defence spending beyond 1% of GDP. This opens the door to
large- scale military investment. Up to €600 billion over the next 14
years is needed on top of the current defence budget to meet NATO
targets and to compensate for a US drop-out. Remarkable here is that
Germany did not commit to a specific spending goal -- for instance, 3%
of GDP -- but stated that defence spending will be determined by what is
needed. What comes on top is a €500 billion special fund for
infrastructure that is largely driven by security needs. What is
extraordinary is not only the scale of the shift, but the speed with
which the new government and old parliament together made it happen. The
constitutional change was pushed through within two to three weeks in
both the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, the chamber of the 16 federal
states, including with votes from the future opposition in the Bundestag
-- a political feat unprecedented in modern Germany. It signals a clear
consensus about the urgency with which greater spending on defence is
required -- and that the status quo no longer provides the tools
necessary for national and European security. This consensus, however,
was not made transparent during the election campaign. Chancellor Merz
avoided disclosing the full extent of his defence spending ambitions to
avoid alienating fiscally conservative voters and party members.
Post-election polls show that the public supports the new course, but
there is evident frustration at the way it was introduced, with many
citizens feeling they were not fully informed before casting their
votes. This adds to the political polarisation in Germany, where right-
and left-wing populists increasingly steer the political debate. In
fact, while there is support for the overall course, a majority of
Germans lack confidence in the incoming government's capacity to solve
the country's problems. In addition to creating the financial room for
manoeuvre, the new government has also sought to adapt structures and
processes to enable it to act in the quickly changing, and challenging,
environment. Foreign policy in particular will be consolidated in the
chancellery. A National Security Council and a crisis response
headquarters will be set up within the Chancellor's office to better
coordinate government security policy and crisis response. For the first
time since the 1960s, the chancellery and the foreign ministry will be
run by the same party, with the conservative Johann Wadephul taking over
the MFA. In the military realm, several initiatives are planned to
simplify and speed up procurement. Additionally, the government intends
to better use Germany's defence industrial potential, for instance by
considering entering into key defence industries if the ownership
structure would put them at risk of foreign control. A double strategic
shock Germany's political class did not arrive at this turning point by
accident. Two external shocks -- one from Russia and one from the United
States -- have structurally altered the strategic environment for
Berlin. The first, and more familiar one, is the ongoing war in Ukraine.
Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, and the subsequent erosion of
European deterrence credibility, laid bare Europe's -- and especially
Germany's -- lack of military readiness. Despite its pledges, the
country struggled to deliver on the air defence systems, ammunition,
logistical support, and the fighting forces it promised to NATO. This
experience has underlined how dangerously dependent Europe has become on
US military capabilities, and how slowly the EU's largest economy
responded to a major war on the continent. The second shock has been
less kinetic, but no less impactful. Under Donald Trump's second
administration, the US has increasingly treated Europe not as a partner
but as a strategic irritant. This has been across all key areas of
transatlantic relations, from trade to defence. At the Munich Security
Conference in February 2025, Vice President JD Vance described Europeans
as ideological adversaries; during the infamous Oval Office meeting
between Trump and Zelenskyy, Trump pressured Ukraine to end the war on
Russian terms. Trump's tariffs then dealt a further blow to the
alliance. All of these led to German policymakers being confronted with
the possibility that Washington may no longer be the ally it once was.
This realisation is particularly daunting for Germany, a country whose
postwar identity is tightly interwoven with its relationship to the US.
American leadership enabled German reintegration into the international
system, guaranteed its security, underpinned its economic rise and
supported European integration to embed Germany. To now see that
relationship unravelling, or at least becoming conditional, did not only
lead to a conceptual rethink but had an emotional impact in Berlin's
foreign policy circles. Moreover, it is remarkable how quickly the now
governing Conservatives in particular have come to question their
once-strong transatlantic compass. A new kind of leadership

\[PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUME\]

Faced with this dual shock, [Germany is rethinking its **entire**
strategic **posture**. The incoming government is operating on the
premise that Europe must assume far more responsibility for its own
defence, and that [Germany, given its size and economic capacity,
**cannot avoid** a]{.mark} **leadership** role]{.underline}. This
feeling is captured in Chancellor Merz's call for Germany [to [move from
a **sleeping**]{.mark} middle power [**to** a **leading** middle
power]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Crucially, [[this]{.mark} leadership [is]{.mark} **not** envisioned as
**unilateral**. Instead, Berlin is pivoting toward
"**[minilateralism]{.mark}**" -- [a]{.mark} pragmatic [mix of **smaller
cooperation**]{.mark} formats [that complement broader]{.mark} EU and
NATO [structures]{.mark}]{.underline}. These include the E3 format
(Germany, France, UK), E3+ (adding Poland and Italy), and the Weimar
Triangle (France, Germany, Poland) for strategic planning and industrial
coordination; and new, flexible cooperation tracks with both EU and
non-EU allies. This includes the 'Coalition of the Willing', launched by
France and the UK after the Munich Security Conference in February 2025,
to uphold a potential ceasefire in Ukraine.

[[What sets this]{.mark} moment [apart is that Germany]{.mark} now
[has]{.mark} both [the **political will** and]{.mark} the [**financial
means** to drive defence initiatives]{.mark} ([as well as]{.mark} the
**[support]{.mark}** and **encouragement** [of]{.mark} its [European
partners]{.mark}). Unlike many European partners constrained by debt
burdens or domestic opposition, [Germany's **constitutional
flexibility** gives it unique capacity]{.mark} to invest and
scale]{.underline}.

But [political [will must **translate** into
**capability**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The government now faces the
daunting task of rebuilding its armed forces -- not just in terms of
equipment, but in readiness, logistics, and sustainability. The biggest
challenge is the recruitment and retention of personnel. The recently
adopted "Swedish model" of voluntary military service will not be
enough.

[Germany is not an Arctic state]{.underline} like Norway, and unlike the
emerging superpower China, which has described itself as a 'Near Arctic
State', it does not claim any relevance in the Arctic. Therefore, [[the
question arises as to why a]{.mark} European [middle power is interested
in the Arctic]{.mark} in the first place]{.underline}. Up until the
Russian war of aggression, Germany's interest was primarily focused on
scientific questions such as how climate change is affecting the Arctic
and what we can learn from it. In addition, [[Germany]{.mark} as an
**economic power** [is **dependent** on]{.mark} free [access to sea
routes and resources]{.mark} -- also with a view to **securing** its
supply chains. Russia's war in **[Ukraine]{.mark}** has [changed
Germany's focus]{.mark} in this respect, too, and inevitably drawn its
attention [to the **military**]{.mark} **strategic
[significance]{.mark}** [of the Arctic]{.mark} North Atlantic
region]{.underline}. What is more, there are acts of sabotage against
underwater infrastructure in the European North Sea and the Baltic Sea
by ships owned by Chinese companies and the Russian 'shadow fleet' as
well as espionage activities by Russian research vessels to contend
with. The German-Norwegian cooperation in the construction of submarines
is similar to the planned US-Finnish cooperation on icebreakers: it is
[[a **specific measure**]{.mark} to [give]{.mark} due [attention]{.mark}
to a strategically important area]{.underline}.

[Status **must be acknowledged** to have meaning]{.underline}, pointing
to the importance of recognition, defined as the perception of a country
by 'others'. [[Recognition]{.mark} not only **[solidifies]{.mark}**
middle power status but also [**facilitates** and
**strengthens**]{.mark} this **[status]{.mark}** by [offering
opportunity]{.mark} structures [for]{.mark} diplomatic engagement and
**[enhanced influence]{.mark}** through]{.underline}, for example,
access to [international forums]{.underline} and diplomatic dialogues.
[Recognition is also [**essential** for fulfilling]{.mark} typical
middle power [functions]{.mark}, such as neutral arbitrator in disputes,
conflict mediator and advocate for **multilateralism** and the
rules-based international order]{.underline}.

Broadly in alignment with constructivist perspectives, [we define middle
power as a status [based on]{.mark} an image a country is
**projecting**. This projected image creates expectations regarding
behaviour, [**compelling states to engage in specific activities** to
bolster visibility]{.mark} and acknowledgment linked to middle power
status. Mere [possession of **capabilities** is
**insufficient**]{.mark}; their strategic **[application]{.mark}** to
influence outcomes [is **crucial**]{.mark}. States aspiring to middle
power status intentionally deploy their capabilities to garner
[**specific recognition** from other actors]{.mark}, thus
**[shaping]{.mark}** their engagements in **[i]{.mark}**nternational
**[r]{.mark}**elations]{.underline}.

[**Active involvement** in international affairs is pivotal for middle
powers, **directly correlating** with the level of recognition achieved.
These 'shaping powers' actively influence international outcomes by
championing international rules, norms, fostering cooperative
institutions and advocating for multilateralism, thereby **enhancing**
the **recognition** of their status]{.underline}.2

Linking the elements of capabilities, identity and engagement to middle
power status acquisition offers a comprehensive understanding how
countries aim to position themselves within the international system
(Teo, 2022). Capabilities, the combination of economic strength,
military capabilities, technological advancements and soft power
elements, collectively form the foundation of a country\'s influence and
capacity to impact global or regional affairs. These capabilities, when
effectively utilised and projected, contribute significantly to a
country\'s recognition as a middle power. Identity, the self-perception
of a country, is an important aspect as it determines what status a
country seeks. Active engagement in regional and global forums,
institutions and initiatives is also pivotal for status recognition.
Participation in diplomatic dialogues, conflict mediation, specialised
diplomacy and contributions to international public goods provision
amplify a country\'s influence, ultimately enhancing its recognition as
a significant actor in global or regional affairs.

[Applying this framework to assess Germany\'s positioning as a middle
power]{.underline} within the Indo-Pacific region [involves examining
its capabilities, its self-perception and its engagement, contributions
to shaping regional dynamics and advocacy for international
norms]{.underline}.

Germany and its Indo-Pacific 'tilt'

With the publication of its Indo-Pacific strategy in September 2020,
Germany became the second European country, following France, to respond
to the increasing importance of the Indo-Pacific region.3 The
[guidelines underscore the [**imperative** to safeguard
Germany\'s]{.mark} substantial **[economic interests]{.mark}** in the
region and to address geopolitical risks stemming from the intensifying
**US--China rivalry**]{.underline}. Given that one-fifth of its total
trade is linked to the Indo-Pacific, [[ensuring **open markets** and
**free trade**]{.mark} in the region [are of paramount
importance]{.mark} to Germany]{.underline} (The Federal Government,
2020). Furthermore, [the strategy is part of a broader recalibration,
[signifying]{.mark} an [expansion and diversification of Germany\'s
relations]{.mark} with the region, both in terms of geographic reach and
thematic focus. At the core of this approach is the explicit [aspiration
to actively participate in shaping]{.mark} the relatively [new]{.mark}
political [concept]{.mark}]{.underline} of the Indo-Pacific. [This
endeavour is driven in part by calls from within the region for
**greater** German **involvement**. [Established
partnerships]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as those with the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Japan, [[are]{.mark} regarded as
[the foundation for enhanced **multilateral cooperation** across]{.mark}
various domains such as [environmental and climate]{.mark} protection,
[security]{.mark}, human rights, [rule of law]{.mark}, deepening
economic ties, [free trade]{.mark}, digital transformation, as well as
cultural, educational and scientific exchanges]{.underline} (Paul et
al., 2020: 1).

Germany\'s engagement in the Indo-Pacific signifies its ambition for a
more pronounced status in the region. [Recognised for its
export-oriented economy and industrial strength, [Germany]{.mark} ranks
as the world\'s **fourth largest economy**, trailing only behind the
United States, China and Japan. Within Europe, it [is the largest
economy and a **key force** driving]{.mark} the economic strength of
[the EU]{.mark}]{.underline} (European Union). Despite this formidable
economic stature, however, [Germany\'s influence [outside Europe]{.mark}
has [often]{.mark} been [perceived as]{.mark} restrained, contributing
to its characterisation as a '**[reluctant]{.mark} power**']{.underline}
(Gray, 1994; Meiers, 1995), which directly ties to Germany\'s
self-identity.

Some scholars [view Germany as a 'self-assured middle power,' its status
primarily rooted in **robust** economic **performance** and soft power
attributes. These include its status as a **stable** liberal
**democracy** and significant contributions to culture, science and
research]{.underline} (Münkler, 2006). In terms of international
engagement, [[Germany]{.mark} actively contributes to generating
**collective goods** and fulfils international obligations. Its
political and military [capabilities are]{.mark} deeply [integrated
into]{.mark} EU and **[NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline} (North Atlantic
Treaty Organisation) structures (Münkler, 2006). An intriguing
perspective is Maull\'s concept of 'civilian power,' introduced to
characterise Germany\'s foreign policy approach (Maull, 1990).
[Emphasising the adept utilisation of soft power, diplomacy and economic
means, this form of foreign policy engagement is intricately [linked
to]{.mark} **German [self-identity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It resonates
with Germany\'s historical context and strategic culture, where the
country has traditionally preferred self-restraint and a cautious
foreign policy approach, avoiding military assertiveness in favour of
diplomatic engagement and economic influence. It is guided by three core
principles (Maull, 1990; Maull, 2018)4:

Aversion to military power

Strategic restraint and a persistent aversion to military forms of power
remain hallmarks of German foreign policy (Blumenau, 2022: 1899--1911;
Siddi, 2016: 159; Helwig, 2020: 442, 451; Quinville, 2022). Historical
experiences, including the perils of nationalism and the consequences of
the use of military force, have led successive German governments to
prioritise economic development and European integration. [The enduring
psychological impact of these legacies has shaped three core national
interests: security, peace and international rehabilitation]{.underline}
(Lubkemaier, 2021: 21). Even in contemporary times, the term 'power' is
used very reluctantly within German political discourses (Maull, 2018:
460).

Preference for cooperation and multilateralism

[German governments tend to [favour cooperative solutions and]{.mark}
the promotion of **[multilateralism]{.mark}** to address international
management issues. German foreign policy has long been guided by its
commitment to key principles such as Atlanticism, European integration,
support for the rule-based international order and multilateralism. The
[special relationship with the **U**]{.mark}**nited [S]{.mark}tates**
[and a commitment to NATO]{.mark} have been **[fundamental]{.mark}**
pillars [for German security]{.mark} policy. Additionally, Germany is
deeply integrated into the EU and supports multilateral
institutions]{.underline} such as the United Nations (UN) and the
Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). [[By
actively participating in the process]{.mark} of European integration,
[Germany]{.mark} has not only made significant contributions to regional
stability and prosperity but has also [reinforced its position as a
**responsible**]{.mark} international **[actor]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### Middle Power\-\--AT: High/NUQ\-\--2NC

#### Middle power is low. Germany is dependent on the US in the status quo, but the counterplan [enables]{.underline} German middle power.

Second, the Bundeswehr was founded for and inte­grated into NATO from the
outset; military operations other than in defence of the country and
NATO mem­bers were not envisaged. Since the end of the Cold War, the
Bundeswehr has been deployed for purposes other than national and
alliance defence. However, [two things have not changed: [Germany
remains **depend­ent** on]{.mark} the support of its [allies]{.mark} for
its defence. Secondly, Germany **[never acts alone]{.mark}** -- it
deploys its armed forces only in joint operations with partners.
Consequently, in contrast to states of comparable size, [Germany has
not]{.mark} (yet) had to develop [a **strategic culture**]{.mark} that
is [based on **strictly national** interests and]{.mark} informed by
**[independent]{.mark}** military [operations]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Finally, there is a third reason for military restraint that is not
rooted in specific German characteristics. It has a structural and
pragmatic aspect. Inevitably, the mere existence of armed forces signals
mistrust, for there would be no need for them if -- as in the EU -- a
non-violent settlement of conflicts were the uni­versally respected norm.
Hence, even a military pos­ture that is meant to be defensive -- but is
not per­ceived as such by others -- can lead to an arms race and
war-prone tensions.

The pragmatic aspect relates to the experiences with failed
interventions, such as in Iraq and Libya. After nearly 20 years, the
Afghanistan mission ended in a botched withdrawal and a return to power
of the Taliban. Still, it would be fallacious to see the Afghanistan
debacle as evidence that there can be no military solutions. The Taliban
defeated NATO troops and the Afghan army. Although their victory does
not solve Afghanistan's problems, the Taliban wore down the US and
regained power through force.

Afghanistan offers no reason to throw out the baby with the bathwater.
Among the lessons of the inter­vention is the trivial but crucial insight
that, although armed forces can only be successful as part of a
multi-dimensional strategy guiding their application, they are
indispensable to such a strategy.2

Thus, [[Germany will continue to **require** a military
**anchor**]{.mark} to safeguard its core foreign policy interests of
peace, security, welfare, and cooperation. Since [it can **only**
realise these]{.mark} interests [as]{.mark} a member of the EU and
**[NATO]{.mark}**, the anchor must be a [collective backstop to which
Germany]{.mark} must [make]{.mark} a proper **[military
con­tri­bution]{.mark}**. For years, Germany has not fulfilled this
require­ment. It has consistently underperformed with respect to NATO's
goal of spending 2 per cent of a coun­try's gross domestic product on
defence by 2024 at the latest. The Bundeswehr suffers from massive
equipment deficiencies, and the public's awareness of security risks is
lacking]{.underline}.

At the same time, [Germany's security situation has
deteriorated]{.underline}: Russia's domestic weaknesses are fuell­ing
outward aggressiveness under Putin's leadership; an autocratic China
sees itself in the global ascendancy and is behaving as such; the
American-Chinese rivalry is heating up; and [Germany's most important
non-Euro­pean partner remains domestically polarised]{.underline} even
after the change from Trump to Biden, [raising doubts about its
reliability and demanding more mili­tary self-reliance from its European
allies]{.underline}. In addition, there are persistent regional
conflicts in the Middle East, bilateral tensions between nuclear powers,
as well as terrorist and cyber threats.

[For Germany to successfully meet these challenges, the mental [gap
between]{.mark} the [importance]{.mark} of security policy and the
esteem with which it is held by policy­makers, the media, and the public
at large [must be closed. **Military-backed risk prevention**]{.mark}
and management must be seen for what they are: [**vital** to
Ger­many's]{.mark} democratic [stability]{.mark}, sustainable
[prosperity, and political **self-determination**]{.mark}. This
[requires]{.mark} that the government and parliamentarians be ready to
**confront** the public's "friendly **disinterest**" in matters of the
military, equip the armed forces with appro­priate matériel, and
**[contribute to NATO]{.mark}**, the EU, and other formats to a level
commensurate with Germa­ny's size and interests]{.underline}.

#### Time is [running out]{.underline} to revitalize it.

Moreover, [[German]{.mark} policymakers must make further fundamental
decisions if their country is to adequately fulfil the **central role**
in NATO its location, size, and economic power dictate. This fundamental
problem is further exacerbated by the fact that it is already becoming
evident that the **[measures]{.mark}**]{.underline} Scholz [announced
[are only being implemented **hesitantly**, or not at all]{.mark}:
Germany is once again [in **danger** of **breaking**]{.mark} the
grandiose **[promises]{.mark}** it has made to NATO. [If]{.mark} partner
countries' [expectations]{.mark} raised by the chancellor's speech
[were]{.mark} once again to be [**disappointed**, Germany would
**lose**]{.mark} what remains of its international **trust** and
**[credibility]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Furthermore, it was the United States, with its comprehensive commitment
to supporting Ukraine, and its military reassurance of Eastern European
NATO partners that was, so far, the decisive element in preventing a
Russian victory in Ukraine, and a spillover of the conflict to European
neighbours. Without the US, Europe would have come dangerously close to
the worst-case scenario: complete occupation of Ukraine and further
Russian attacks on Georgia, the Republic of Moldova, and other
countries.

But European security policy is facing another Zeitenwende, one that has
been foreseeable for years: [[this]{.mark} may well be [the **last
time**]{.mark} that [Washington]{.mark} expends so many military
resources on, and [pays]{.mark} so much policy [attention to]{.mark},
**European [security]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is because
Washington's strategic focus has long been the Indo-Pacific. The rapid
pace of Beijing's military build-up is forcing the US to place
increasing strategic focus on balancing Chinese power, which entails a
partial military withdrawal from the European theatre.

This [leaves an **extremely narrow [time frame]{.mark}** -- probably
only [until the end of the **2020s**]{.mark} -- in which European
allies, first and foremost [Germany]{.mark}, can and [must prepare to
assume **responsibility** for]{.mark} Europe's conventional
**[defence]{.mark}** themselves. This strategic horizon [leaves **no
time for**]{.mark} a **sluggish** Zeitenwende or yet again an
[incomplete]{.mark} fulfilment of [assurances given to NATO]{.mark}.
Instead, German policymakers **[must]{.mark} realise** that the
measures]{.underline} Scholz announced [will not by themselves be
sufficient to set the necessary security policy course and [return
Germany to]{.mark} its position as [**backbone** of]{.mark} Europe's
conventional [defence]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[An **already-strained** relationship will be echoed in Poland's
diplomatic endeavors, as [Duda is **unlikely** to **back
down**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In January 2025, Warsaw assumes the presidency of the European
Union---and Law and Justice had passed a bill that compels the
government to agree its priorities with the sitting president. On the
basis of that, Duda already announced the pillars of Polish EU
leadership, wanting to focus on relations with the United States, the
proposed accession of Moldova and Ukraine, and Ukraine's postwar
reconstruction and energy transition. On paper, these do not appear too
hard to swallow for Tusk, but it remains to be seen how the government
will implement them and who will be the face of the EU presidency.

Duda will claim the right to represent Poland as head of state, but
[[Tusk has a **history** of **clashing**]{.mark} with Law and Justice
presidents]{.underline}; he was repeatedly challenged by the late
President Lech Kaczynski over EU summit participation during his first
tenure as prime minister. Tusk might have a stronger hand this time,
which is also due to an instrumental role of Piotr Serafin, his former
chief of staff during the European Council days, now Poland's acting
permanent representative to the EU. With Tusk's man in Brussels, he will
be more ambitious both at home and abroad.

On the other hand, [[Duda]{.mark} is also responsible for approving the
government's choices for ambassadorships]{.underline}. Back in January,
he was expected to agree on the vast majority of replacements proposed
by the foreign office, but now the presidential palace is
[[**objecting** to the government's plans]{.underline}]{.mark}. Sikorski
wanted a swift and sizable turnaround, proposing to replace some 50
ambassadors in a very short time span---and Duda objected.

[An unofficial [**stalemate** continues]{.mark}, to the point that the
presidency has reportedly threatened to block a potential
nomination]{.underline} for Sikorski to become an EU commissioner if he
does not bow to pressure. The Foreign Ministry plans to respond by
recalling ambassadors and sending new chargés d'affaires in their place,
a provisional solution at best. It could [result in a severely polarized
diplomatic corps]{.underline}, on the one side faithful to Law and
Justice, on the other heavily pro-European.

Right now [[there is]{.mark} certainly a lot of **[will]{.mark}** in
Warsaw [to transform Poland's role]{.mark} in Europe---[**but** there
might **not** be **a way**]{.mark}. Domestic [struggles]{.mark} will
[consume **time** and **energy**]{.mark}]{.underline}, possibly [[at the
**expense** of]{.mark} international [aspirations]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### Middle Power\-\--Indo-Pacific\-\--2NC

#### German middle power solves Indo-Pacific conflict [better]{.underline} than the US\-\--Germany avoids US containment that causes miscalculation, but the perm [destabilizes]{.underline} it.

This aligns well with the middle power framework discussed earlier --
[[Germany seeks]{.mark} the status of a '**civilian [middle
power]{.mark}**']{.underline}. This indicates the need to differentiate
middle powers beyond the categories of 'traditional'/'emerging' or
'Western'/'Global South'.5 By seeking 'civilian middle power' status,
[Germany aims to set itself apart from traditional middle powers such as
the UK or France. This is deeply rooted within Germany\'s identity and
determines its external engagement which is characterised by an explicit
normative foreign policy approach and an aversion to balance-of-power
politics]{.underline}. As mentioned previously, status is a relational
concept and status recognition is crucial. It not only shapes
expectations but also provides the foundations for opportunity
structures, thereby influencing engagement possibilities. Middle power
status is the result of an ongoing process aimed at sustaining
recognition and reputation in the international arena. The status of
'civilian middle power' prompts specific engagement patterns that
prioritise peaceful conflict resolution through negotiations, mediation
and diplomacy. Efforts focus on pre-emptively addressing potential
conflicts via diplomatic channels and preventive measures. Adherence to
international law, particularly treaties prohibiting force except in
cases of self-defence or UN Security Council authorisation, is
fundamental. Emphasis is placed on collective security and cooperation
among nations via multilateral forums like the UN and regional
alliances. Upholding humanitarian principles, protecting civilians and
fostering cultural understanding through educational and diplomatic
initiatives are integral aspects of this positioning.

[Germany\'s [Indo-Pacific strategy]{.mark} can be regarded as [part of
this]{.mark} **status-affirmation** process: setting Germany on course
towards [heightened]{.mark} **global [engagement]{.mark}**, aiming for
**greater recognition** as civilian middle power in one of the most
dynamic regions of contemporary world affairs. Germany\'s Indo-Pacific
strategy]{.underline}, articulated as guidelines in 2020, [reveals a
**nuanced** and **comprehensive** approach to the region
[despite]{.mark} the acknowledged **[challenges]{.mark}**. The strategy
underscores Germany\'s commitment to a civilian middle power
positioning, strategically **identifying** key **interests** and
articulating guiding principles to **enhance visibility** and
recognition in the region]{.underline} (The Federal Government, 2020:
8--9). Among the explicitly stated interests are [[ensuring peace and
security]{.mark}, [diversifying relations to **avoid
dependency**]{.mark} entanglements and actively [advocating for a
**balanced**]{.mark} and **inclusive** regional **[order]{.mark}**.
Additionally, the guidelines emphasise the maintenance of open sea
lanes, open markets and free-trade policies, as well as the promotion of
digital transformation for connectivity and shared development. Given
Germany\'s position as a major exporting country, the stability of the
region holds vital economic importance. Trade with countries in the
Indo-Pacific area constitutes a substantial proportion of Germany\'s
total trade]{.underline}, with millions of jobs in Germany dependent on
this (The Federal Government, 2020: 9). Moreover two-thirds of
international sea trade takes place in the Indo-Pacific. Hence, Germany
places great importance on stability and open shipping routes (The
Federal Government, 2020: 24). Although not explicitly stated in the
guidelines, [it is evident that [**China\'s** increasing]{.mark}
strategic and economic [influence is a]{.mark} significant
[concern]{.mark}]{.underline}. China alone contributes to approximately
one-third of global economic growth, and nearly 50% of German foreign
trade in the Indo-Pacific is with China (The Federal Government, 2020:
47). In response, [Germany aims to adopt a policy of diversifying and
deepening relations with other countries in the region, **reducing
overreliance** on a single economy. At the same time, the [German
government appears]{.mark} to be **[cautious]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Diversifying relations in the Indo-Pacific does not entail a decoupling
from the Chinese economy.

[Germany\'s [approach to the Indo-Pacific]{.mark}]{.underline}, as
outlined in the guidelines document, [**[differs]{.mark} significantly**
[from]{.mark} that of some of its Western allies, **most notably** the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates. Germany actively [strives to **avoid
containment**]{.mark}]{.underline}. With these guidelines, Germany aims
to position itself as a mediating (civilian) middle power in the
Indo-Pacific region, [[distinct from]{.mark} being part of a US-led
[effort to balance against China\'s]{.mark} increasing
[influence]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, there is no mention of the
Quad in the German document. [Berlin explicitly [avoids]{.mark} both a
[**unipolar** and]{.mark} a **[bipolar]{.mark}** structure emerging in
the [Indo-Pacific]{.mark}]{.underline} (The Federal Government, 2020:
9). [[Any dominance by a single power or rivalry between two]{.mark}
major powers [would]{.mark} pose **[risk]{.mark}**s to [Germany\'s
**interests**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Else, Indo-Pacific miscalc goes nuclear.

JL

The first reason for [concern is]{.underline} the [nature of the
**[Indo-Pacific]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and specially the Western
Pacific. Most thinking on [crisis stability and deterrence]{.underline}
has [focused on]{.underline} the **[Cold War
confrontation]{.underline}** between NATO and the Warsaw Pact along a
European land border [and the associated]{.underline} contours of the
US--USSR **[nuclear relationship]{.underline}**. But the Indo-Pacific is
principally a maritime theatre. It's been argued that the maritime
domain may be less [[prone to]{.mark} **inadvertent escalation** and
**disastrous [miscalc]{.mark}ulation**]{.underline}. Ships are
inherently mobile, and when they withdraw from a confrontation that
doesn't ipso facto represent the ceding of ground, making a backdown
more politically palatable.26 Another example is submarine deployment,
which is something rarely publicly signalled and therefore withdrawable
without loss of face. In other words, a level of ambiguity about forces
in the maritime domain, or an ability to shift intent and narrative or
maintain deniability, may offer opportunities for maintaining stability.

But those same attributes of the maritime domain could also be
interpreted as reasons for concern. To begin with, [[offence--defence
distinguishability is **very low**]{.mark} **at sea**]{.underline}.27
For instance, the [Washington Conference]{.underline} in 1921--22, which
was an [[attempt]{.mark} by the major powers [to limit]{.mark} the
**naval [arms race]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[struggle]{.mark}d [to
define]{.mark} **offensive [capability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
vertical launching system (VLS) ubiquitous on Western warships is a
prime contemporary example of this problem. [An [adversary **doesn't
know**]{.mark} whether [VLS]{.mark}]{.underline} cells [[contain]{.mark}
**anti-air missiles**]{.underline} for self-defence, [land-attack
**[missiles]{.mark}**]{.underline} for long-range strike, [or the
next-generation stealthy **anti-ship missile**]{.underline} currently
under development for the US military. [Submarines]{.underline} and the
contents of their magazines [pose a **similar problem**]{.underline}.

And some analysts have noted that '[modern [warship]{.mark}s have
**glass jaws**]{.underline}'---that is, [they're
vulnerable]{.underline}, if not to sinking, [then to being put **out of
action** by even a **single missile**]{.underline} or torpedo hit.28
This arguably leads to a dynamic in which '[whichever side completes the
**targeting chain**]{.underline} first [and fires first almost **always
wins**]{.underline}', [and [creates]{.mark} a powerful **[incentive
to]{.mark} pre-empt**]{.underline}.29 In other words, ships that can be
discovered are very vulnerable. There can, therefore, [be a major
advantage in **shooting first**]{.underline} when conflict seems
imminent. This suggests the potential for maritime scenarios in which
[**[escalat]{.mark}ion** pressures are]{.underline} very
**[strong]{.underline}**.

The longstanding naval [preoccupation with
[presence]{.mark}]{.underline} can also be [[read as]{.mark} the
[capacity]{.mark} to act [with **little warning**]{.mark}]{.underline},
and sea power has specific characteristics that [[produce
**uncertainty**]{.mark} **and ambiguity**]{.underline}.30

The doctrine and concepts underwriting the employment of naval platforms
reflect those features. The various iterations of [US **maritime
doctrine**]{.underline}---air--sea battle, joint concept for access and
manoeuvre in the global commons (JAM-GC), now distributed maritime
operations (DMO)---[are **[highly]{.mark} offensive**]{.underline} ways
of operating. Some analysts have rightly noted [this]{.underline}
doctrine [as [escalatory]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Jonathan Caverley and
Peter Dombrowski have argued:

> \[A\]t the minimum, it appears the [USN will focus on destroying the
> **PLAN fleet** and associated **island bases**]{.underline} in the
> South China Sea should a conflict erupt. At the maximum, it, along
> with the \[US\] Air Force, is preparing for a rapid, blinding assault
> on the Chinese mainland to remove any Chinese capability for denying
> US access beyond the twelve nautical miles of the territory the United
> States recognises as Chinese ...31

It isn't surprising that these [concepts are so **[offensive]{.mark} in
[nature]{.mark}**]{.underline}: [the US military is expected to
**develop options** that [offer]{.mark} the [**prospect** of]{.mark}
**military victory**]{.underline} in a US--China conflict. Assuming that
neither side wishes to engage [in **[nuclear war]{.mark}**]{.underline},
the focus for [analysis should be on whether US and Chinese
force]{.underline} structures and plans [increase]{.underline} the risks
of [inadvertent or **accidental escalation**]{.underline}, pre-emption
and loss of control. In other words, which features of the strategic
dynamic between the US and China raise the risk of escalation?

In short, [contemporary naval capabilities are **ambiguous in intent and
nature**]{.underline}, [creating the possibilities for inadvertent and
**accidental escalation**]{.underline}, and the vulnerability of
critical capabilities in a missile exchange creates pressures for
pre-emption.

[[Germany]{.mark} further [commits to]{.mark} contributing to regional
**environmental protection** and supporting access to **reliable
information**]{.underline} (The Federal Government, 2020: 9). In
outlining these interests, the document [specifies]{.underline} the
principles guiding Germany\'s engagement with the region, accentuation
of a collective European approach, a commitment to multilateralism and
[a dedication to [the **rules-based international order**]{.mark}. The
emphasis on [multilateralism]{.mark}, a rules-based order and free trade
[stems from]{.mark} general [concerns about]{.mark} the
**[erosion]{.mark}** of the liberal international order, which [poses a
**threat**]{.mark} to Germany. Growing support for populist movements
and leaders in Europe, Asia and America is united by the rejection of
fundamental principles of liberalism such as universal human rights and
multiculturalism, seemingly spelling the end of ever-expanding
**globalisation**]{.underline}. Recent developments in international
trade underscore a rise in trade restrictions amid a backdrop of
economic uncertainty intensified by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,
the conflict in Ukraine and a food security crisis. Compounding this
issue are expanding import restrictions, signalling a decline in global
trade dynamics (WTO, 2022). According to some, liberalism is on the
verge of becoming 'obsolete' (Barber et al., 2019). Even more concerning
was the rejection of multilateralism, free trade and the 'America first'
approach of the United States under the 2017--2021 Trump administration,
actively undermining key pillars of the liberal international order
(Kampfner, 2020). It is noteworthy that
[[Germany\'s]{.underline}]{.mark} Indo-Pacific [[guidelines were
published during]{.mark} the tenure of the **[Trump]{.mark}**
administration, reflecting an attempt to cautiously forge a more
**independent** foreign policy approach]{.underline}.

The guidelines also align with the UN development goals, prioritise
human rights and the rule of law and reject containment in favour of
inclusivity and cooperative partnerships (The Federal Government, 2020:
11). Foreign minister Heiko Maas underlined the significance of
collaborating with nations in the Indo-Pacific region,
[[stressing]{.mark} the importance of establishing [**international
rules** and counteracting]{.mark} balance-of-power politics dominated by
emerging powers like [China, committing Germany to]{.mark} **actively
[shape]{.mark}** [the]{.mark} international [order]{.mark}]{.underline}
in the Indo-Pacific region (Monath, 2020). In essence,
[Germany\'s]{.underline} Indo-Pacific [guidelines reflect a well-rounded
and principled stance, positioning the country as a diplomatic force
committed to **positive engagement** and **collaborative
development**]{.underline} in the region.

The [guidelines]{.underline}, in turn, [provide evidence of an aversion
of balance-of-power politics, emphasising collective cooperation,
multilateral action and a normative foreign policy [approach focused
on]{.mark} the provision of international [**public goods** and]{.mark}
the support of **[democracy]{.mark}**, human **rights** and
**international law**]{.underline}. For example, the document
[underscores Germany\'s intention, as part of the EU, to participate in
shaping]{.underline} the Indo-Pacific [and [**implementing** global
**norms** in regional structures]{.mark}]{.underline} (The Federal
Government, 2020: 2--10, 23--27). The guidelines highlight Germany\'s
plan for active involvement in global forums and dialogue mechanisms,
including UN mechanisms, the G20, the IMF (International Monetary Fund)
or the WHO (World Health Organization). In terms of regional
institutions, ASEAN, as the region\'s most vibrant regional mechanism,
is mentioned frequently. Other multilateral platforms include the ASEAN
Regional Forum (ARF), Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), the Mekong River
Commission and the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM), to name but a few.
Moreover, [Germany is evidently [striving to be recognised as a
**promoter**]{.mark} of a human rights, the rule of law and a provider
of collective goods]{.underline}. The term 'Menschenrechte' (human
rights) appears more than 40 times in the guidelines,
'Rechtsstaatlichkeit' (rule of law) 17 times (see also The Federal
Government, 2020: 41--44).

#### Else, [extinction]{.underline}.

**Belfield** **23**, Research Associate and Academic Project Manager at

(Haydn, 2023, "Collapse, Recovery, and Existential Risk," in *How Worlds
Collapse: What History, Systems, and Complexity Can Teach Us About Our
Modern World and Fragile Future*, p. 74-76.) Accessed online via
University of Michigan //DH

[A world **dominated** by totalitarian states would be]{.underline} more
incompetent, [more **war-prone**, less cooperative]{.underline}, and
more inhibitive of progress [than one dominated by democratic
states]{.underline}. Our current world is not particularly competent,
peaceful, cooperative, or progressive---a totalitarian-dominated world
would be worse. [It would increase the **risk** of another collapse and
**extinction**]{.underline} and could shape the future toward less
desirable trajectories (Beckstead, 2013).

[Totalitarian states are incompetent. They are bad at forecasting and
dealing with disasters]{.underline} (Caplan, 2008).16 This can be seen
most clearly in the great famines of Communist China and the USSR, in
which millions died (Applebaum, 2017; Becker, 1996; Dikötter, 2010;
Snyder, 2010). In comparison, functioning multiparty democracies rarely,
if ever, experience famines (Sen, 2010). ["**[Established
autocracies]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (or "personal"/"sultanist")
[[are]{.mark} particularly bad]{.underline}, as there are few checks or
restraints on arbitrary rule and the whims and ideology of the single
individual, even from other elites (Svolik, 2012). From the inside, the
"inner circle" around Mao, Stalin, and Hitler seems incredibly chaotic,
with elites strongly incentivized to conceal information and encouraged
by the autocrat to squabble and feud---so they are divided (Conquest,
1992; Kershaw, 2008; Zhang & Halliday, 2006). If totalitarian states are
worse at addressing social, environmental, and technological problems,
then a world dominated by them would likely be [[**worse** at
**responding** to risks]{.underline}]{.mark} of collapse and extinction.

[A world dominated by totalitarian states is more likely to have major
wars]{.underline}. States with near-universal adult suffrage rarely (if
ever) go to war with one another (Barnhart et al., 2020), so [[a world
dominated by democracies has **fewer wars**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[**Miscalc**ulation might be]{.underline} a particular [problem for
[totalitarian states]{.mark} due to personalization and disincentives
for accurate information,]{.underline} leading to well-known strategic
disasters such as Hitler and Stalin's blunders in World War II (Bialer,
1970; Noakes & Pridham, 2001), or at a smaller level, Saddam Hussein's
rejection of diplomacy (Atkinson, 1993). [War
[make]{.mark}s]{.underline} collapse and [**[extinction]{.mark}** more
[likely, by]{.mark} raising the chance of **[w]{.mark}**eapons of
**[m]{.mark}**ass **[d]{.mark}**estruction being
[use]{.mark}d.]{.underline}

Linked to this, [totalitarian states are **less cooperative** than
democratic states]{.underline}. While cooperation is possible (Ginsburg,
2020), [their internal norms are characterized by
**[paranoia]{.mark}**]{.underline} and treachery, and their lack of
transparency limits their ability to credibly commit to agreements.
[This is bad for all risks that require cooperation such as pandemics or
climate change]{.underline} (Tomasik, 2015).

Finally, [continued social and scientific **progress** is likely to
**reduce risks of**]{.underline} collapse and
**[extinction]{.underline}**. Social progress could reduce global
inequality and other risk factors. [Scientific progress could help
address natural risks and climate change]{.underline} (Sandberg, 2018),
differentially increase defensive rather than offensive power (Garfinkel
& Dafoe, 2019), [and solve **safety challenges** in AI or
biotech]{.underline}nology (Russell, 2019). [However,]{.underline} as we
will now discuss [totalitarian states would likely [inhibit **social
progress**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

A central question from a longtermist perspective is: Which values
should shape the future? I would argue that we should prefer it to be
shaped by liberal democratic values. This is not to say that the current
democracy-dominated world is perfect---far from it. The fate of billions
of factory-farmed animals or hundreds of millions of people in extreme
poverty makes that abundantly clear. However, democracies have two
advantages. First, [democracies have space for cosmopolitan values such
as human rights, plurality, freedom, and equality. These are better than
those that characterize life under totalitarianism: Fear, terror,
subjection, and secrecy]{.underline}. Second, they have within
themselves the mechanism to allow progress. In the last 100 (or even 50)
years, the lives of women, LGBT people, religious minorities, and
non-white people have dramatically improved. Our "moral circle" has
expanded, and could continue to expand (Singer, 1981). The arc of the
moral universe is long, but given the right conditions, it might just
bend toward justice (King, 1968). A global society dominated by these
values, and with the possibility of improving more, has a better
longterm potential. [A totalitarian-dominated world,]{.underline} on the
other hand, [would reduce the space for resistance and
progress---**[distorting]{.mark}** the human
**[trajectory]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[We should be particularly concerned about "bottlenecks" at which values
are particularly important---where there is a risk of
"locking-in]{.underline}" [some]{.underline} particular set of (possibly
far from optimal) [values]{.underline}. While they are currently faroff,
[future technologies such as artificial general intelligence, space
settlement, life extension (of autocrats), or much better surveillance
could enable lock-in]{.underline} (Caplan, 2008).17

Conditional on them avoiding new catastrophes, world orders dominated by
totalitarians could be quite long-lasting (Caplan, 2008). Democracies
can undermine authoritarian and totalitarian regimes through the
following ways: Control, including conquest; contagion through
proximity; and consent, promoting receptivity toward democratization
(Whitehead, 2001). Democracies can actively undermine these regimes
through war, sanctions, hosting rebellious exiles, or sponsoring
internal movements. Passively, through contagion, they offer a
demonstration that a better, more prosperous life is possible. For
example, in the final years of the USSR, ordinary Soviet citizens were
able to see that the West had a higher standard of living---more
innovation, more choice, and more consumer goods. The elites were able
to read books from the outside, and travel---Gorbachev's contacts and
friendships with European politicians may have made him more favorable
to social democracy (Brown, 1996). Democracies can undermine the will
and capacity of the coercive apparatus (Bellin, 2004). However, in a
world not dominated by democracies, all these pressures would be far
less.

A world in which, say, totalitarian regimes emerged as dominant after
World War II (for example if the USA was defeated) could be
self-reinforcing and long-lasting, like the self-reinforcing
relationship of Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia (Orwell, 1949). Orwell's
fictional world is characterized by constant low-grade warfare to
justify emergency powers and secure elites, and with shifting alliances
of convenience as states bandwagon and balance, thereby preventing any
resolution. A totalitarian-dominated world order could be rather robust,
perhaps for decades or even centuries.

[A long-lasting totalitarian-dominated world would extend the period of
time humanity would spend with a heightened risk of collapse or
extinction, as well as increased potential for distortion of the human
trajectory [and]{.mark} the possibility that a **["lock-in"]{.mark}**
event may occur]{.underline}. This example illustrates the possibility
of a "negative recovery," [[**result**ing in]{.mark} a
trajectory]{.underline} [with less or no scientific and social progress
and a less favorable geopolitical situation, which would threaten [the
**destruction** of humanity]{.mark}'s longterm potential]{.underline}.

Germany finds itself alongside its European allies and partners in a
complex security environment. [Russian aggression in [Ukraine]{.mark}
continues to [**threaten** broader]{.mark} European
**[security]{.mark}**]{.underline}, while the concerning escalation in
the Middle East, transatlantic trade tensions, and global power
competition are further complicating the geopolitical landscape.

On his first day as Chancellor, Friedrich [Merz]{.underline} already
[travelled to]{.underline} France and Poland--- two other corners of the
Weimar Triangle---to meet with President Emmanuel Macron and Prime
Minister Donald Tusk. Soon after, visits followed to
[Ukraine]{.underline}, Brussels, the Nordics as well as most recently to
Washington, DC on June 5, 2025. This flurry of high-level meetings with
foreign leaders [underscores [Merz's ambition to reshape]{.mark}
Germany's role [from]{.mark} a "[dormant to]{.mark} a **[leading middle
power]{.mark}**"---one that actively shapes European defense and
security---and [signals]{.mark} that **[foreign policy]{.mark}** will be
[at the heart]{.mark} of his chancellorship]{.underline}.

Increasing direct support for Ukraine

[Continued support for **[Ukraine]{.mark}** against ongoing Russian
aggression [remains the **backbone**]{.mark} of Germany's foreign
policy. [Germany]{.mark} is already the second largest donor of
[aid]{.mark}, including military, after the United States. The new
government has vowed to **[increase]{.mark}** this even [**further**
amid]{.mark} calls for Europe take on the lion\'s share and compensate
for planned [cuts]{.mark} of US military assistance]{.underline} to
Ukraine.

During the visit of President Zelensky in Berlin on May 28, a new €5
billion aid package for Ukraine was announced---increased to €9 billion3
after the latest visit of Defense Minister Boris Pistorius in Kyiv on
June 12, 2025. While delivery of Taurus missiles to Ukraine, although
highly discussed, remains off the table, the aid package includes an
industrial partnership to help Ukraine's domestic production of
long-range weapons, drones and other capabilities.

[Learning from the battlefield and supporting the defense industry in
[Ukraine is]{.mark} a **priority** for Germany]{.underline}. Ukrainian
military is now the biggest and the most battle-tested army in Europe.
Its adaptability and ingenuity to counter Russia aggression---operation
Spiderweb, the highly precise and coordinated small drone attack that
damaged over 40 Russian warplanes, being just the latest

Sustaining pressure on Russia towards a ceasefire

Next to direct support for Ukraine, [Germany shares the [objective
of]{.mark} the need to achieve a **[ceasefire]{.mark}** in Ukraine and
strives to lead and assist in joint European and transatlantic
efforts]{.underline}. However, in the past few month, President Putin
has shown little to no interest in negotiating in good faith. On the
contrary the situation on the ground in Ukraine has only escalated.

The growing frustration over Putin's unwillingness to reach a ceasefire
has resulted in both sides of the Atlantic preparing to further tighten
sanctions against Russia. In the United States Senate, a bipartisan the
Sanctioning Russia Act of 20255 has been proposed, which aims to impose
"hard-hitting" sanctions such as a 500% tariff on any country buying
Russian energy or other exports. Similarly, the European Union also
unveiled its 18th sanctions package, which includes lowering the oil
price cap from \$60 to \$45 as well as a transaction ban on Nord Stream
pipelines. To this end, Chancellor Merz has unequivocally ruled out any
restart of the pipelines.

[The new German government [supports]{.mark} maintaining **sustained
pressure** on Russia through **[sanctions]{.mark}**. While the United
States' shifting approach toward Russia has posed
challenges]{.underline}, Chancellor Merz emphasized, during his visit in

bring an end to the war and secure]{.mark} a [durable]{.mark} and just
[peace]{.mark} in Ukraine. For [Germany]{.mark}, this unified strategy
[is **essential**]{.mark} not only to safeguard broader European

Despite these reflections, in February 2022 I was shocked when Vladimir
[Putin]{.underline} tried to conquer [[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
expected repercussions for Russia itself, and for the whole of humanity,
were so destructive that it seemed an unlikely move even for a
coldhearted megalomaniac. Yet the Russian autocrat [chose to **end** the
most **peaceful** era in human history, and]{.underline} to [[push
humanity toward a **new era** of war that]{.mark} might be **worse**
than anything we have seen before]{.underline}. Indeed, [it might
**[threaten]{.mark}** the very [survival]{.mark} of our

\[TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMMITTED\]

This is a tragedy, especially as the past few decades have shown that
war isn't an inevitable force of nature. It is a human choice that
varies from place to place and time to time. Since 1945, we have not
seen a single case of war between great powers, nor a single case of an
internationally recognized state annihilated through foreign conquest.
More limited regional and local conflicts remained relatively common; I
live in Israel, so I know this perfectly well. But the Israeli
occupation of the West Bank notwithstanding, countries have rarely tried
to unilaterally expand their borders through violence. That's one reason
the Israeli occupation has drawn so much attention and criticism. What
was the norm for thousands of years of imperial history has become
anathema. Even when taking civil wars, insurgencies, and terrorism into
account, in recent decades wars have killed far fewer people than
suicide, road accidents, or obesity-related diseases. In 2019, about
70,000 people were killed in armed conflicts or police shootings, about
700,000 people committed suicide, 1.3 million people died in road
accidents, and 1.5 million people died from diabetes. Yet peace has not
been just a matter of numbers. Perhaps the most important change in
recent decades has been psychological. For thousands of years, peace
meant "the temporary absence of war." For example, in between the three
Punic Wars fought by Rome and Carthage were decades of peace, but every
Roman and Carthaginian knew that this "Punic Peace" could be shattered
at any moment. Politics, economics, and culture were all shaped by
constant expectations of war. During the late 20th century and early
21st century, the meaning of the word peace changed. Whereas the Old
Peace meant only "the temporary absence of war," the New Peace came to
mean "the implausibility of war." In many (though not all) regions of
the world, countries stopped fearing that their neighbors might invade
and annihilate them. Tunisians stopped dreading an Italian invasion,
Costa Ricans didn't think that the Nicaraguan army might make a dash to
San José, and Samoans didn't fear that a Fijian war fleet might suddenly
emerge from beyond the horizon. How can we tell that countries weren't
concerned about these things? By looking at their state budgets. Until
recently, the military was the expected No. 1 item on the budget of
every empire, sultanate, kingdom, and republic. Governments spent little
on health care and education, because most of their resources went to
paying soldiers, constructing walls, and building warships. The Roman
Empire spent about 50 to 75 percent of its budget on the military; the
figure was about 80 percent in the Sung Empire (960--1279); and about 60
percent in the late-17th-century Ottoman Empire. From 1685 to 1813, the
share of the military in British government expenditure never fell below
55 percent and averaged 75 percent. During the great conflicts of the
20th century, democracies and totalitarian regimes alike plunged into
debt to finance their machine guns, tanks, and submarines. When we fear
that the neighbors might at any moment invade, loot our cities, enslave
our people, and annex our land, that's the reasonable thing to do. State
budgets in the era of the New Peace make for far more hopeful reading
material than any pacifist tract ever composed. In the early 21st
century, the average government expenditure on the military has been
[[only 6.5
percent]{.underline}](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.ZS?end=2020&start=1988&view=chart),
and even the United States, the dominant superpower, has spent only
about [[11
percent]{.underline}](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.ZS?end=2020&locations=US&start=1988&view=chart)
to maintain its supremacy. Because people no longer lived in terror of
external invasion, governments could invest far more money in health
care, welfare, and education than in the military. Average expenditure
on health care, for example, has been 10.5 percent of the government
budget, or about 1.6 times the defense budget. For many people today,
the fact that the health-care budget is bigger than the military budget
is unremarkable. But if we take the New Peace for granted and therefore
neglect it, we will soon lose it. The new peace was the outcome of three
main forces. First, technological changes, and above all the development
of nuclear weapons, greatly increased the price of war, especially
between superpowers. The atomic bomb turned superpower war into a mad
act of collective suicide, which is why superpowers have not gone to war
directly against one another since Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Secondly,
economic changes greatly decreased the profits of war. Key economic
assets were once material resources that could be conquered by force.
When Rome defeated Carthage in the Punic Wars, it became rich by looting
its defeated rival, selling its people into slavery, and taking over the
silver mines of Spain and the wheat fields of North Africa. In recent
decades, however, scientific, technical, and organizational knowledge
have become the most important economic assets in many places. Silicon
Valley has no silicon mines. Trillion-dollar businesses such as
Microsoft and Google are built on what's in the minds of engineers and
entrepreneurs rather than what's in the ground under their feet. And
whereas seizing silver mines by force is easy, you cannot acquire
knowledge that way. This economic reality led to a sharp decline in the
profitability of conquest. Although wars over material resources
continue to characterize certain parts of the world---such as the Middle
East---the big economies of the post-1945 period grew without imperial
conquest. Germany, Japan, and Italy saw their armies broken and their
territories shrink---but after the war, their economies boomed. The
Chinese economic miracle was achieved without engaging in any major war
since 1979. As I was writing these lines in early November, Russian
soldiers were looting the Ukrainian city of Kherson, sending back to
Russia trucks full of carpets and toasters that they'd stolen from
Ukrainian homes. This will not make Russia rich, and it will not
compensate the Russians for the enormous cost of the war. But as Putin's
invasion of Ukraine proves, technological and economic changes by
themselves were not enough to produce the New Peace. Some leaders are so
power-hungry and so irresponsible that they might begin a war even if it
is economically ruinous to their country and pushes the whole of
humanity toward nuclear Armageddon. Accordingly, the third essential
pillar of the New Peace has been cultural and institutional. Human
societies were long dominated by militaristic cultures that viewed war
as inevitable, and even desirable. Aristocrats in both Rome and Carthage
believed that military glory was life's crowning achievement and the
ideal route to power and riches. Artists such as Virgil and Horace
concurred, devoting their talents to singing of arms and warriors,
glorifying bloody battles, and immortalizing brutal conquerors. During
the New Peace era, artists turned their talents to exposing the horrors
of war, while politicians sought to leave their mark by initiating
health-care reforms rather than by looting foreign cities. Leaders
throughout the world---influenced by the fear of nuclear war, by the
changes in the nature of the economy, and by new cultural
trends---joined forces to build a functioning global order that allowed
countries to develop peacefully while restraining the occasional
warmongers. This global order has been based on liberal ideals, namely,
that all humans deserve the same basic liberties; that no human group is
inherently superior to all others; and that all humans share core
experiences, values, and interests. These ideals encouraged leaders to
avoid war and instead work together to protect our common values and to
advance our common interests. The liberal global order linked the belief
in universal values to the peaceful functioning of global institutions.
Although this global order was far from perfect, it improved the lives
of people not just in the old imperial centers such as Britain and the
United States, but also in many other parts of the world, from India to
Brazil and from Poland to China. Countries in all continents benefited
from the rise in global trade and investments, and almost all countries
enjoyed a peace dividend. Not only could Denmark and Canada shift
resources from tanks to teachers---Nigeria and Indonesia did the same.
Anyone who rants about the defects of the liberal global order should
first answer one simple question: Can you please name the decade in
which humankind was in better shape than in the 2010s? Which decade is
your lost golden age? Is it the 1910s, with the First World War, the
Bolshevik Revolution, Jim Crow, and European empires brutally exploiting
much of Africa and Asia? Is it perhaps the 1810s, with the Napoleonic
Wars reaching their bloody climax, Russian and Chinese peasants crushed
by their aristocratic overlords, the East India Company securing its
control of India, and slavery still legal in the United States, Brazil,
and most other parts of the world? Perhaps you are dreaming of the
1710s, with the War of the Spanish Succession, the Great Northern War,
the Mughal succession wars, and a third of children everywhere dying
from malnutrition and disease before reaching adulthood? The new peace
didn't result from some divine miracle. It was achieved by humans making
better choices and building a functioning global order. Unfortunately,
too many people took this achievement for granted. Perhaps they assumed
that the New Peace was guaranteed mainly by technological and economic
forces, and that it could survive even without its third pillar---the
liberal global order. Consequently, that order was first neglected and
then attacked with growing ferocity. The attack started with rogue
states such as Iran and rogue leaders such as Putin, but by themselves,
they were not strong enough to end the New Peace. What really undermined
the global order was that both the countries that benefited most from it
(including China, India, Brazil, and Poland) and the countries that
built it in the first place (notably the U.K. and the United States)
turned their backs on it. The Brexit vote and the election of Donald
Trump in 2016 symbolized this turn. Those who have challenged the global
liberal order mostly didn't wish for war. They just wanted to advance
what they understood as the interests of their country, and they argued
that each nation-state should defend and develop its own sacred identity
and traditions. What they never explained was how all of these different
nations would deal with one another in the absence of universal values
and global institutions. The opponents of the global order did not offer
any clear alternative. They seemed to think that somehow, the various
nations would just get along fine, and the world would become a network
of walled-but-friendly fortresses. Fortresses are seldom friendly,
however. Each national fortress usually wants a bit more land, security,
and prosperity for itself at the expense of its neighbors, and without
the help of universal values and global institutions, rival fortresses
cannot agree on any common rules. The network-of-fortresses model was a
recipe for disaster. And disaster was not long in coming. The pandemic
demonstrated that in the absence of effective global cooperation,
humanity cannot protect itself against common threats such as viruses.
Then, perhaps because he observed how COVID further eroded global
solidarity, Putin concluded that he could mete out the coup de grâce by
breaking the biggest taboo of the New Peace era. Putin thought that if
he conquered Ukraine and absorbed it into Russia, some countries would
gasp in disbelief and condemn him---but nobody would take any effective
action against him. The argument that Putin was pushed unwillingly to
invade Ukraine to preempt a Western attack is nonsensical propaganda.
Some vague Western threat is not a legitimate excuse for destroying a
country, looting its cities, raping and torturing its citizens, and
inflicting untold suffering on tens of millions of men, women, and
children. Anyone who believes that Putin had no choice should name the
country that was preparing to invade Russia in 2022. Do you think the
German army was massing to cross the border? Do you imagine that
Napoleon got out of his grave to lead the Grande Armée yet again to
Moscow, and Putin had no choice but to preempt the imminent French
onslaught? And remember that Putin actually first invaded Ukraine back
in 2014---not in 2022. Putin prepared his invasion for a long time. He
never accepted the breakup of the Russian Empire, and he never saw
Ukraine, Georgia, or any of the other post-Soviet republics as
legitimate independent nations. Whereas---as noted earlier---average
military expenses have been about 6.5 percent of government budgets
around the world and 11 percent in the United States, in Russia they
have been far higher. We don't know exactly how much higher, because it
is a state secret. But estimates put the figure somewhere in the
vicinity of 20 percent, and it may even be more than 30 percent.

Donald [Trump has put Germany's security at risk]{.underline}. His
campaign trail claim that NATO was "obsolete" eroded the alliance's most
important resource --- its credibility. But [his repetition of the same
comments as U.S. president has been a five-alarm fire for German
strategists]{.underline} and for anyone else who cares about the future
of Europe. [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} is not just the world's most
powerful and long-standing military alliance, which has successfully
deterred the potential enemies of its members for seven decades. It [[is
a guarantor of Germany's]{.mark} national [security]{.mark} and a
precondition of its continued existence as a politically independent
state in Europe.]{.underline} And nobody disputes that [[NATO's backbone
is the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates' superior and vast military
capacities]{.underline}. They protected Germany against Soviet
aggression during the Cold War and have deterred revisionist Russia's
repeated demonstrations of force over the last decade. And [at the core
of this deterrent are nuclear weapons, many of them stationed in Germany
itself]{.underline}. [That leaves Germany with a very serious
debate]{.underline} ahead: [whether to continue relying on a United
States that is now committed to signaling its unreliability or to begin
pursuing its own nuclear deterrent]{.underline} --- either on its own or
as part of a new European security structure. Rudolph Herzog's recent
Foreign Policy article presented a simple view of this argument, where
proponents of the idea, such as myself, were represented as adventurous
cowboys blind to the lessons of history. But the debate is far more
complicated, and more critical, than Herzog portrayed. This is a debate
triggered not by indulgent fantasies but by the potential of a strategic
vacuum at the heart of the continent. **[[The withdrawal of]{.mark} this
[security guarantee]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as repeatedly suggested by
Trump (to the delight, or perhaps at the prompting, of Vladimir Putin),
**[would [expose Germany]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[and its
neighbors]{.underline}** **[[to]{.mark} an increasingly
[revisionist]{.mark} and aggressive [Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
intent to redress the collapse of the Soviet Union that cost Russia its
imperial possessions in Eastern Europe. We can't be blind to the signs
of Russian aggression. Look at the fate of Crimea in 2014, annexed by
Russia in a fit of pique at Ukraine's refusal to be a vassal state, or
the Russian nuclear weapons in the exclave of Kaliningrad (the former
Königsberg) now pointing at German targets. [Russia is unlikely to
invade Germany itself]{.underline}. [But **[if]{.mark} the [power
balance swings in favor of Russia]{.mark}** and against Western Europe,
that leaves small states like the Baltics in danger from Putin's
revanchist ambitions.]{.underline} With the whip hand in Eastern Europe,
[Putin would be able to pressure]{.underline} or frighten [Western
Europe into accepting his authoritarian view]{.underline} of the world.
**[[Smaller states would swing toward]{.mark} the [Russia]{.mark}n side,
[leaving Germany]{.mark} dangerously [exposed]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
For both moral and realist reasons, Germany needs to shield Eastern
Europe against Trump --- and nuclear weapons are the only way to
guarantee its neighbors independence. Putin is one tweetstorm by Trump
away from having the conventional and strategic military upper hand in
Europe. German Chancellor Angela [Merkel cannot sustain her sanctions
regime]{.underline}, backed by the EU, [if the United States retreats
from Europe]{.underline}, precisely [because Putin knows that her very
effective use of economic power ultimately rests on American military
power standing at the ready in the background]{.underline}. But [**if
NATO goes**, the weakness of German and European diplomacy, faced with a
revisionist great power, becomes conspicuously clear]{.underline}. [If
this really were to happen]{.underline}, **[[German nuclear weapons
would be]{.mark} the [most powerful way to compensate for]{.mark} the
[American withdrawal]{.mark}]{.underline}** and the best means to even
out the military imbalance that Trump would have created in Russia's
favor. The inherent terror of nuclear weapons means even a relatively
small German program could be a mighty deterrent against Russia's 7,000
nuclear warheads. In his piece, Herzog argues that nuclear weapons go
against Germany's post-World War II efforts to act as a global moral
leader. But Germany's European neighbors don't want lecturing but a more
engaged and militarily active Germany. The Baltic states openly demanded
German panzer battalions during the Crimean crisis. Even the powerful
conservative Polish politician Jaroslaw Kaczynski, formerly an outspoken
Germanophobe, publicly welcomed the idea of a German-driven "European
nuclear superpower" in February. World War II has no real political
weight in today's relations between Germany and its eastern (and
western) neighbors anymore. Rather, today's perception of the
Russian-driven security dilemma in Eastern Europe determines the views
of the Eastern European countries whose courage helped bring down Soviet
oppression in the late 1980s. Central and Eastern Europe share this
perception of threat from Russia, and, as Kaczynski indicated, this
means nuclear power projection on the part of Berlin would be accepted
as legitimate. [We might ask why the Germans don't figure something out
with the British and the French, both of whom already own nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. But [**the [U.K.]{.mark}'s [and France]{.mark}'s
[nuclear stockpiles are]{.mark} partly [outdated]{.mark}, too
[small,]{.mark} [and]{.mark} largely tactical** (i.e.,
[short-range]{.mark}).]{.underline} And, critically, [would the two
countries really step in and shield Germany and Eastern Europe against a
Russian attack?]{.underline} Extended deterrence is a fine thing --- as
long as it works when push comes to shove. The question that the [[U.K.
and France would]{.mark} most likely ask themselves in such a scenario
is why not [stay out and make peace with Russia]{.mark}, [rather than
risk war]{.mark} for the sake of interests in Eastern Europe that they
see as distant from their own concerns]{.underline}. [Such a
self-protective reaction]{.underline} would be understandable (and
predictable). But it also [underlines Germany's need to acquire nuclear
weapons]{.underline} that provide it the ability [to]{.underline}
independently [protect itself]{.underline} and its neighbors to the
east. [It's true that [Germany is]{.mark} a [signatory to the
**N**]{.mark}**uclear Non[p]{.mark}roliferation
[T]{.mark}reaty**.]{.underline} [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} tremendously
important international treaty [[requires all "have-nots" of nuclear
weapons to refrain from acquiring]{.mark} them]{.underline} while the
"haves," in turn, make sure that no one else gets them. That is a valid
statement, as long as the foundations that made it unnecessary for
Germany to even consider nuclear weapons and sign the treaty still
exist. But with NATO becoming "obsolete," the times are rapidly and
drastically changing. [[If]{.mark} the power [conditions that made
Germany's position as a "have-not" justifiable are
removed]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [the [country cannot]{.mark} be
obliged to [remain unprotected]{.mark} in the face of a heavily
nuclear-armed Russia.]{.underline} Other countries, like Japan, may
remain shielded by the United States --- but if Europe is abandoned, a
responsible, and deeply realistic, government can't afford this degree
of self-denial. All this talk of a Berlin deterrent has another purpose,
which outsiders --- even the Economist --- have not fully appreciated.
Proponents of a German nuclear deterrent are fully aware that despite
the U.S. president's final executive power, making NATO "obsolete" would
require the more explicit approval of the administration's top echelons.
[Starting the debate has been a reminder to the more cautious or wiser
elements in the U.S. government of the stark consequences of abandoning
NATO]{.underline}. The United States doesn't want Germany to have
nuclear weapons, and preventing Bonn --- and eventually Berlin --- from
getting them has been one of the side benefits of NATO. This is not to
say that the nuclear proposal was critical in taming Trump's wild talk
for the moment. Other factors may have pushed and pulled the
administration much more strongly to cautiously re-appreciate the
strategic value of NATO. Still, with Merkel having to deny any such
nuclear plans in public early this year, it is not unlikely that the
debate was noted in the United States. Certainly this was the case at
NATO itself when its (American) deputy secretary-general, Rose
Gottemoeller, rejected the idea and instead reassured the European
public that the new U.S. president was aware of his long-standing
obligations and the benefits for international stability.

But however much European intransigence on military spending was a cause
of friction in NATO in the past, it is far from certain that these
positive developments will be enough to contain Trump's personal
volatility and disruptive instincts. Rather than a gradual shift towards
a greater European role in the alliance, we could just as easily see [a
[sudden U.S. abandonment of the alliance]{.mark}]{.underline} (like
Trump allegedly considered at the 2018 summit). Although U.S. officials
have reassured Europeans that any U.S. troop withdrawals Trump may
announce at the summit will not leave gaps in NATO's deterrence and
credibility, disagreements with Trump over Russia and Ukraine---or trade
and tariffs---could escalate any time and result in unexpected U.S.
decisions.

There is also a threat to NATO within Europe: Although European publics
accept the need for greater defense spending, a new target of 5 percent
of GDP, even if it is broadly defined, [will [require]{.mark} most
European [countries to make painful trade-offs]{.mark}, including cuts
to social welfare. This will provide [fertile ground for]{.mark}
pro-Russian [populists]{.mark} on the right and left to make a tempting
offer to voters: If the U.S. might not come to Europe's defense anyway,
why spend all that money on the military instead of [giving in
to]{.mark} some of [Moscow's demands]{.mark}? The specter of appeasement
looms]{.underline}.

In the worst-case scenario of U.S. abandonment, [[Germany would be
particularly vulnerable]{.mark} to extreme strategic and political
shifts. Eastern front-line states with experiences of Russian and Soviet
occupation would resist [even without NATO]{.mark}, and Britain and
France have [nuclear arsenals]{.mark} and a long, unbroken tradition as
European great powers, which [would lead]{.mark} them through any period
of strategic [upheaval]{.mark}]{.underline}. Germany's post-1945
national identity, however, is intricately connected with the concept of
the West under U.S. leadership. What would Germany's role in Europe be
when there is no longer a coherent West united in NATO? [[Right-wing
populists like]{.mark} the anti-U.S. Alternative for [Germany]{.mark}
have an answer: They [want to see a remilitarized Germany that
is]{.mark} much [closer to Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is an

#### Proliferation escalates to a hot war with Russia through use-it-or-lose-it pressures. Even if Germany doesn't finish building its arsenal, the very [attempt]{.underline} to acquire nuclear weapons will trigger conflict. Independently, the AFF doesn't solve deterrence.

[Should Europe find itself caught between a hostile Russia and an
indifferent U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [Berlin would feel
pressure to defend Europe militarily rather than just
politically.]{.underline} [But then it would face the problem of how to
guarantee European security without reviving fears of German
hegemony.]{.underline} And if Germany boosted its military power without
integrating it into the European project, that might well lead to German
isolation and the breakup of the EU. [Nuclear weapons seem to offer
Germany a way out of this impasse. In the eyes of their proponents, they
would deter existential threats and reduce European dependence on the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [without raising fears of
German dominance]{.underline}. "Nuclear power projection on the part of
Berlin would be accepted as legitimate," Terhalle wrote, because "World
War II has no real political weight in today's relations." Instead, it
is the "perception of threat from Russia" that determines policy in
central and eastern European countries. This claim rests on a shaky
foundation. Russia's actions in eastern Ukraine may be driving European
nations together, but the fear of a German resurgence has not gone away
entirely. [**If Germany built nuclear weapons,** **the EU's current
unity would quickly fracture**]{.underline}. [Even if the rest of the EU
accepted German nuclear weapons, that would not end Europe's security
woes.]{.underline} [[**Nuclear weapons cannot deter**]{.mark} the kind
of limited wars [**Russia**]{.mark} has waged so successfully in Crimea
and eastern Ukraine]{.underline}, whoever provides the deterrent. Even
simply replacing the U.S. nuclear deterrent for Europe with a German- or
EU-led one would not be easy. [[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[struggled]{.underline}]{.mark} for much
of the Cold War [[to convince]{.mark} the [Soviet Union]{.mark} that [it
would defend]{.mark} West [Berlin]{.mark} with nuclear
weapons]{.underline}, especially given the Soviets' conventional
military superiority; [[Germany would face]{.mark} the [same
problem]{.mark} as it tried [to persuade Russia of its willingness to
use nuclear force]{.mark} to defend other EU countries]{.underline},
especially the Baltics, which are under the greatest threat from Russia.
Both France and the United Kingdom already possess nuclear weapons.
Their experiences offer mixed lessons of the benefits of a nuclear
arsenal. Both gained some independence from the United States after
fielding their own nuclear forces, yet both still relied on the United
States to supply conventional military force in Europe, and neither
country's nuclear arsenal could match the Soviet Union's. Nor did their
nuclear forces do a great deal to improve NATO's collective defense.
Only the United Kingdom pledged to use its deterrent to defend other
NATO members, while France stayed outside NATO's nuclear structure. And
it took the United Kingdom a great deal of time and effort to make its
commitment credible. Germany should remember that simply possessing
nuclear weapons does not automatically make allies more secure.
Regardless of the ultimate effect of a nuclear arsenal,
[[Germany]{.mark} would]{.underline} have to surmount major technical,
political, and security hurdles before acquiring one. It would need to
either [[repurpose its nuclear energy infrastructure]{.mark} for weapons
production [or sprint to the bomb from new military
facilities]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Either path would take
substantial time and effort. **[Each would involve activities that, if
detected, would [ring alarm bells]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Germany would
struggle to keep any effort to build nuclear weapons in military
facilities secret given the vast construction work this would involve.
Nor could it simply rely on its civil nuclear infrastructure. In the
wake of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan, [[Merkel]{.mark}'s
government [decided to phase out]{.mark} all of Germany's
[nuclear]{.mark} power [plants by]{.mark} 20[22]{.mark}. This decision
makes it difficult for Germany to take technical steps toward the bomb
under the guise of a peaceful program.]{.underline} **[[Even]{.mark}
seemingly innocuous moves, such as [keeping]{.mark} a few large
[reactors online past the deadline, would raise suspicions]{.mark}. In
any case, the time would eventually come when [Germany could no longer
hide]{.mark} its [nuclear ambitions]{.mark}.]{.underline}** At that
point, the German government would face intense domestic political
opposition and perhaps even civil unrest from a population that
determinedly opposes nuclear weapons. A March 2016 poll found that 93
percent of Germans favor an international ban on nuclear weapons and
that 85 percent would like to see the United States remove all its
nuclear weapons from Germany. The German population would not back a
public nuclear weapons program, and any leader who authorized a
clandestine effort would face political ruin. Moreover, **[a German
nuclear arsenal would risk bringing down the international
nonproliferation regime]{.underline}**. **[Before acquiring the bomb,
[Germany]{.mark} would have to [leave]{.mark} the [N]{.mark}uclear
Non[p]{.mark}roliferation [T]{.mark}reaty, a move that would
[threaten]{.mark} the continued existence of [the treaty
itself]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} Despite the NPT's successful
record, the treaty's future already looks uncertain. Under the NPT,
states with nuclear weapons agreed to pursue disarmament, but in recent
years, progress toward this goal has stalled, and nonnuclear states have
increasingly voiced their frustration that the nuclear weapons states
have not fulfilled their promise. A foundational goal of the treaty,
moreover, was to keep Germany from building nuclear weapons. **[If
Berlin defected, the [nonproliferation regime]{.mark} might [collapse
entirely]{.mark}, because [other countries would no longer feel
bound]{.mark} by the treaty's collective bargain.]{.underline}** Germany
would also need to modify or withdraw from the so-called Two Plus Four
Treaty, the agreement on reunification that East and West Germany signed
with France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States
in 1990. In that document, Germany affirmed its "renunciation of the
manufacture and possession of and control over nuclear, biological, and
chemical weapons." The treaty was meant not only to end the Cold War but
also to prevent any future German Sonderweg; abrogating it would bring
back the German question and deliver an affront to the four countries
that paid such enormous costs to defeat Nazi Germany in World War II.
Worst of all, **[the [pursuit of]{.mark} a [German]{.mark} nuclear
[arsenal, rather than deterring aggression,]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[]{.mark}[**could [increase]{.mark} the risk of [conflict]{.mark} in
Europe**, since Russia would]{.underline} likely [work to prevent
Germany from acquiring the bomb]{.underline}. **[[Moscow]{.mark} could
[assassinate German nuclear scientists, use cyberattacks to
sabotage]{.mark} German nuclear industrial [infrastructure,
and]{.mark}]{.underline}** perhaps go so far as to **[[strike
German]{.mark} nuclear [facilities]{.mark}]{.underline}** from the air.
**[Even [covert operations could]{.mark} quickly [spiral into]{.mark}
outright [confrontation]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Even if Germany managed
to acquire nuclear weapons, it would then face the daunting task of
making sure they could survive a Russian attack.]{.underline} In recent
years, [Russia has moved its missiles]{.underline} westward, [targeting
Germany]{.underline} and other NATO members. [Now that Russia
has]{.underline} allegedly [deployed multiple cruise
missiles]{.underline} in violation of the 1987 Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Forces Treaty, under which the Soviet Union and the United
States agreed to abandon midrange missiles, [its ability to destroy a
fledgling German nuclear stockpile is only growing]{.underline}.
**[[Unless Germany managed to]{.mark} conceal and [protect]{.mark} its
nuclear [weapons]{.mark} almost [immediately]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[German [leaders could, during]{.mark} a [crisis with Russia]{.mark},
feel pressure to [launch]{.mark} a [preemptive]{.mark} nuclear
[attack]{.mark} against Russia in order [to avoid losing]{.mark} the
[arsenal to]{.mark} a [Russian first strike]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
These formidable barriers to a German nuclear program have led some to
return to the idea of a British-French deterrent. But [the
[U]{.mark}nited [K]{.mark}ingdom's]{.underline} impending [[departure
from]{.mark} the [EU leaves Germany]{.mark} with the sole option of
[reaching out to France]{.mark}]{.underline}. This would not be the
first time that France and Germany have considered a joint European
nuclear deterrent. In 1957, shortly after the Suez crisis, when tensions
between France and the United States were running high and the French
government began to doubt the credibility of the U.S. nuclear guarantee,
France suggested to Italy and West Germany that the three countries
develop nuclear weapons together. The next year, French President
Charles de Gaulle took office and quickly canceled the secret
negotiations and began an indigenous French nuclear program, only to
raise the prospect of nuclear cooperation again with German Chancellor
Konrad Adenauer in 1962. And [[in the]{.mark}
19[90s]{.mark}]{.underline}, France offered to extend its nuclear
umbrella to Germany after reunification in an attempt to decrease U.S.
influence in Europe. All these [efforts failed]{.underline}, in part
[because the [French]{.mark} consistently [refused to relinquish control
over]{.mark} their [arsenal]{.mark}, as to do so would have been to give
up French autonomy in foreign policy. This [calculus has not
changed]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} a fact that should give German
policymakers pause today. Moreover, by reviving such talk, Berlin risks
giving isolationist elements in the Trump administration exactly what
they want: an excuse to disengage.

### !\-\--Power Vacuum

#### Absent German consultation, European power vacuum escalates to World War Three.

**Yoshida 11**, political commentator for the American Thinker, author
of The Blast of War and owner of Yoshida Media Company (Adam, "Could We
See World War Three in Our Lifetimes?," American thinker,
<http://www.americanthinker.com/2011/10/could_we_see_world_war_three_in_our_lifetimes.html>)

Three months ago, in this space, I asked whether, [[if present
trends]{.mark} were to [continue, we could find ourselves
embroiled]{.mark}]{.underline} in something like [[a **Third
World**]{.mark} **[War]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Working from that concept
and the thoughtful remarks of a number of readers, I decided to delve
into the question a little more deeply and, as a result, have produced a
new e-book entitled The Blast of War: A Narrative History of the Third
World War. The book, a \"future history,\" lays out how the present
situation \-- if carried over into the future \-- could lead us into
catastrophe. [[The world]{.underline}]{.mark} situation today [[is as
unsettled as it has been]{.underline}]{.mark} at any time [[since
the]{.underline}]{.mark} late 19[[30s]{.underline}]{.mark}. Indeed, I
believe that the underlying cause of this is the same as it was in that
era: irresolute policies by Western leaders that will, if they are not
corrected soon, leave nations with no choices except for abject
surrender and all-out war. Time and time again world leaders have chosen
to punt dangerous problems down the road rather than take the risks
necessary to resolve them today. Some of these problems, such as
China\'s reckless pursuit of short-term growth as a substitute for
political reform, unsustainable global debt loads, Iran\'s headlong rush
towards nuclear weapons, the illegal movement of ten million Mexicans
into the United States, and Europe\'s lackadaisical economic
integration, can and will have no happy resolution. The question is what
shade of terrible the results will be. Under ordinary conditions and in
isolation, each of these problems might be manageable. However, as Mark
Steyn points out in his excellent new book After America, there is
another parameter that has created the conditions for an unimaginable
disaster: the fact that the United States increasingly appears unwilling
or unable to provide the sort of leadership necessary to move the world
through these troubled days. It is well and good enough for
neo-isolationists, such as Ron Paul and his supporters, to argue that
the United States ought to disengage from international affairs \-- and
for liberals (and not a few conservatives) to argue for reductions in
defense budgets \-- but the reality is that, as Steyn points out, a
world without American leadership will be an anarchic place where,
without anyone able to assert himself, more and more states will be
tempted to resort to aggression to achieve their foreign policy
objectives. Consider the following: - China\'s economic growth is almost
certainly the result of a bubble that cannot and will not survive
forever. In the face of the degradation of Communist ideology, the sole
reason why the party\'s authoritarian regime survives is because it has
managed to take credit for economic growth. When the growth stops \--
and it will \-- and the party is suddenly sitting on more than a billion
poor people (and the few hundred million wealthy ones seek the exits),
how will the party seek to sustain its rule? If they were faced with a
well-armed United States with a web of external alliances, they would
have little choice but to take their chances on internal reforms of some
sort. On the other hand, if faced with a distracted United States and a
divided Asia, who is to say that the Chinese \-- who, it must not be
forgotten, will have, as the baleful legacy of their one-child policy,
tens of millions more young men than women \-- will not, in the
time-worn fashion of endangered regimes throughout history, seek to
resolve their problems through war? It is astonishing to consider just
how little attention we have paid to such a truly dangerous situation.
Here we have a powerful regime likely to suffer severe internal issues
surrounded by weaker states filled with the resources that that nation
needs. I think that, in the likely event of war, future historians will
be amazed by how little attention was paid in advance. - I think that
[[the odds of a European conflict]{.mark} [have]{.mark} [been
underplayed.]{.mark}]{.underline} The core nations of
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[E]{.underline}]{.mark}**uropean
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nion are incredibly invested in the euro and
will, in my judgment, eventually be forced to accept some kind of fiscal
union as its price. Ultimately, that [[will require]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} of a number of smaller states
that will have strong incentives to defect \-- some will want to opt out
of paying for transfers, and others will want to avoid paying their
debts. It is not difficult to imagine that, [[in the event that
some]{.underline}]{.mark} smaller [[nation]{.underline}]{.mark} \-- such
as, say, Greece \-- [[seeks to truly defy]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[[pan-European consensus,]{.underline}]{.mark} some [[cause for military
action]{.underline}]{.mark} against them [[might be **trumped
up**]{.underline}]{.mark} by the Franco-German alliance. - We have good
cause to be worried about the potential of an Iranian nuclear bomb.
However, I think that we have ignored another serious threat: the
gradual transformation of Turkey into an Islamist state. George Friedman
discussed Turkey as a potential antagonist in a mid-century conflict in
his book The Next Hundred Years, but given the unsettled nature of the
Middle East today, I think that we might well find ourselves in a
shooting war with the a Turkish government, whose secret ambition
appears to be the recreation of the Ottoman Empire, sooner than that. -
It is difficult to see how the enduring problem of Mexico will be
resolved without some sort of conflict. Not only is Mexico in internal
chaos as a result of an ongoing war between drug cartels and the
government, but the more than ten million Mexicans illegally residing in
the United States also create an issue that will not be easily resolved.
[[Each]{.mark} of these individual [situation]{.mark}]{.underline}s
[[carries]{.mark} with it some **[danger of war]{.mark}**. However, when
you consider them as a whole, [they create a real risk of a cascade of
chaos that could **consume the whole world**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is
easy to imagine, as I have done in The Blast of War, how [[these
problems]{.mark} \-- **[without sober]{.mark}** world
[leadership]{.mark} \-- [could escalate into an interlocking series of
wars]{.mark}]{.underline} [[that would in]{.underline}]{.mark}
combination result in [[the greatest armed conflict since the Second
World War]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Do Both -- 2NC

#### Independence is key. The perm reaffixes Germany to the US.

[Pax Americana]{.underline} -- the postwar period of relative peace in
the western hemisphere, [with the [US]{.mark} as the dominant economic,
cultural and military world [power]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [[is
**over**. Europe will]{.mark} quickly [have to **adapt**]{.mark} to the
new reality, with the loss of its primary strategic and military
partner. What part now will the EU's largest member state,
**[Germany]{.mark}**, play?]{.underline}

**[[Despite]{.underline}]{.mark}** large gains by the far-right
Alternative für Deutschland (**[[AfD]{.underline}]{.mark}**), which
doubled its support in the federal election on 23 February, [Germany
will be led by Friedrich Merz]{.underline}, head of the conservative
Christian Democratic Union (CDU). [The chancellor-in-waiting [lost no
time in declaring that Europe]{.mark}, faced with an increasingly
adversarial US, [must take its fate into **its own
hands**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"[It is my [**absolute priority** to strengthen Europe as **quickly as
possible** so that we can]{.mark} **actually [become
independent]{.mark}** [from the US]{.mark} step by step]{.underline},"
Merz said, hours after his election victory. Stark words from a
politician who as recently as a few months ago was a bona fide
Atlanticist.

[[Merz wants to forge greater unity in Europe and establish an
independent]{.mark} European defence [capability]{.mark}. It remains to
be seen how he will go about achieving this, but [he clearly aims to put
Germany back]{.mark} into the European driving seat]{.underline}.

[German [leadership has been lacking]{.mark} in recent
years]{.underline}. While Paris and Warsaw took increasingly assertive
positions on European security, [Berlin has remained
cautious]{.underline}. After the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine,
the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, spoke of a Zeitenwende -- a turning point
in German policy to reflect the new realities of the world. But, in the
end, little but hot air was produced.

Since the end of the second world war, [Germany has invested relatively
little in military capacity. Under the Nato umbrella, and with the close
partnership with the US, this was not seen as a problem. But the world
has fundamentally shifted, and Merz sees that [Germany]{.mark}, finally,
[must change]{.mark}, too]{.underline}.

### Do the Counterplan -- 2NC

#### The counterplan is [separate from]{.underline} and [prior to]{.underline} NATO.

One of the top priorities of the Biden administration will be the
revitalization of the transatlantic alliance. [[The]{.mark}
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [and Germany should]{.mark}
[form a]{.mark} joint [working group]{.mark}]{.underline}
[on]{.underline} Russia [policy]{.underline} based in both the National
Security Council and the Chancellor's Office [[to develop a
coordinated]{.mark} [strategy]{.mark}]{.underline} for dealing with
Putin. [[This]{.mark} process [should be **separate** from NATO
consultations]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[NATO now has 30 members. Given its
size and divisions]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[it would be advantageous for
Washington to find agreement with Berlin **prior**
to]{.mark}]{.underline} seeking support from [[other
allies]{.underline}]{.mark}. As the German foreign minister recently
suggested, [[the **German government perceives** a need for
coordination]{.underline}]{.mark} on sanctions policies, and [[this
**should be a key element** in a new]{.mark} transatlantic
[strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### Other Issues\-\--AT: Not Arctic\-\--2NC

#### The Arctic is key to German middle power. The permutation is [too broad]{.underline}\-\--a '[specific measure]{.underline}' is key.

quinneth

[Germany is not an Arctic state]{.underline} like Norway, and unlike the
emerging superpower China, which has described itself as a 'Near Arctic
State', it does not claim any relevance in the Arctic. Therefore, [the
question arises as to why a European middle power is interested in the
Arctic in the first place]{.underline}. Up until the Russian war of
aggression, Germany's interest was primarily focused on scientific
questions such as how climate change is affecting the Arctic and what we
can learn from it. In addition, [[Germany]{.mark} as an **economic
power** [is **dependent** on free access to sea routes and
resources]{.mark} -- also with a view to **[securing]{.mark}** its
[supply chains]{.mark}. Russia's war in **[Ukraine]{.mark}** has
[changed Germany's focus]{.mark} in this respect, too, and inevitably
drawn its attention [to]{.mark} the **military strategic significance**
of [the Arctic]{.mark} North Atlantic region]{.underline}. What is more,
there are acts of sabotage against underwater infrastructure in the
European North Sea and the Baltic Sea by ships owned by Chinese
companies and the Russian 'shadow fleet' as well as espionage activities
by Russian research vessels to contend with. The German-Norwegian
cooperation in the construction of submarines is similar to the planned
US-Finnish cooperation on icebreakers: it is [[a **specific
measure**]{.mark} to [give]{.mark} due [attention]{.mark} to a
strategically important area]{.underline}.

Edited for ableist language, denoted in strikethrough

[[NATO]{.mark} is at a **consequential intersection**. It [can
continue]{.mark} down the path of **status quo**
[towards]{.mark}]{.underline} ~~brain death and~~ [[**obsolescence**,
or]{.mark} NATO [can adapt]{.mark} to the turbulent times [by
**injecting**]{.mark} more **[German leadership]{.mark}** for credible
deterrence]{.underline}, as highlighted by the Secretary General of
NATO, Jens Stoltenberg. Recent comments from the U.S. administration
about troop drawdown in Germany should not come as a surprise to anyone
given the current state of affairs in U.S. domestic politics: COVID-19
has amplified nationalistic sentiments, [and [rising]{.mark} economic
[inequality]{.mark} with[in the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
**will [prioritize domestic]{.mark}** [spending]{.mark} over defense
spending. Calls to shrink the U.S. military's foreign footprint
**predate** the **current** U.S. **administration**. The other side of
the aisle wants drastic cuts to the Pentagon's budget and to curtail
U.S. military bases abroad]{.underline}. Though it is extremely unlikely
that a new hegemonic threat, including Russia, will rise out of Europe
to challenge the United States, a rising Chinese hegemony in the
Indo-Pacific region does challenge U.S. national interests. [Given the
constraints on future U.S. defense spending, European states should
expect U.S. defense spending to prioritize the threats to U.S. national
interests emanating from Asia over European defense concerns. It would
therefore be [**detrimental** to]{.mark} the [NATO]{.mark} alliance [to
continue with]{.mark} a business-as-usual mentality of [**overreliance**
on U.S.]{.mark} forces [without]{.mark} **greater** European
**leadership** and contribution. [Germany]{.mark} should take a more
prominent role in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO)
credible deterrence mission]{.underline}.

[Unlike the international relations tradition of
**realism**]{.underline}, which emphasizes that states are unitary
actors who are in a constant cycle of competition with each other, [NATO
is emblematic of the liberalist tradition that stresses cooperation and
teamwork to achieve common objectives. Many realists do not believe in
the utility of international institutions to approach questions of
international security, but **NATO** is **vital** for the United States
because it helps expand U.S. influence over the foreign and military
policies of European States, thereby allowing the United States to
**amass power**. However, over time, the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[has taken on an **oversized** role]{.mark} in supporting NATO, while a
majority of European allies remained content with putting in the least
possible effort into defense. Cooperation and teamwork, the hallmarks of
[**neoliberalism**, become **difficult** when the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [gets little help]{.mark} in supporting NATO.
Additionally, with NATO being heavily dependent on the U.S. forces, it
allows for the United States to have an **[outsized influence]{.mark}**
on the NATO decision-making process **without** the required **checks
and balances** from other members of the alliance. Absent this balancing
influence within an international organization, such as NATO, strong
states [will]{.mark} use these organizations and interpret laws in ways
to [**further** their **own interests**]{.mark}. This approach by strong
states can **adversely [impact]{.mark}** the **[trust]{.mark}** that
other states have in such institutions, and it could [lead to]{.mark}
the [**downfall** of]{.mark} the institution. When European
**countries** feel that they **cannot trust [NATO]{.mark}** to provide
for their security and survival, [they will pivot towards trying to
**maximize**]{.mark} their **[power]{.mark}** to guarantee their
security, because no state can be certain about the intentions of other
states even if they are allies. There have been hints of a growing lack
of trust between members of the alliance, and recently, [**tensions**
have been **flaring**]{.mark} between European members of NATO. A
fractured NATO without European leadership will exacerbate the fraying
unity and lead to the downfall of the alliance. [It will take]{.mark}
more **significant [German mediation]{.mark}** in the future [to calm
tensions]{.mark} between allies given that the United States focuses
elsewhere]{.underline}.

[Germany can provide the European leadership that NATO urgently requires
to stay relevant. As the Eurozone **powerhouse** with one of the lowest
consolidated gross debts among major western European economies,
[Germany has the **wealth**]{.mark} to invest in NATO's defense
strategy. [France, Italy, Belgium, and the U.K. **cannot
sustain**]{.mark} a higher debt-to-GDP ratio that would result from
spending more on defense. Germany is a **global [leader]{.mark}** [in
innovation and research]{.mark} and possesses the technological
expertise required [to **spearhead**]{.mark} NATO's
**[defense]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Today's NATO challenges differ from
those at the height of the Cold War. There is no longer a threat of the
Red Army marching across Europe and Russia's dwindling population,
economic stagnation, fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, and subsequent
oil war with Saudi Arabia have stymied Vladimir Putin's ambitions.
However, [Russia can still achieve its goals of delegitimizing
democracies and sowing division within Europe through hybrid
warfare]{.underline}.

[Such threats do not require a new German panzer division or other new
military hardware]{.underline}. Moreover, U.S. military assets will
still be present in Europe as part of NATO. The Russian threat to NATO
requires a robust defense strategy focused on countering hybrid warfare,
including cyber and information warfare capabilities, as highlighted by
former U.S. Army Europe Commander Lt. Gen (Ret.) Ben Hodges, former NATO
Supreme Allied Commander Europe Admiral (Ret.) James Stavridis, and
German Minister of Defense Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer.
[[**Reinvigorated** German]{.mark} military
**[spending]{.mark}**]{.underline} to the 1980 level of over 3.14% of
GDP [[and added focus on]{.mark} combating [Russian]{.mark} gray zone
[threats would **enhance**]{.mark} existing [NATO
**capabilities**]{.mark} and help adapt to a multipolar
world]{.underline}.

[It is natural to expect severe [opposition to increased German]{.mark}
defense [spending]{.mark}. **Anti-military sentiments** still run very
deep in domestic German politics. Other European nations will also be
concerned and may object to Germany's taking on a more significant
leadership role in NATO, given the former's history. Although these are
[valid concerns]{.mark}]{.underline}, three main points need emphasis.
First, [the United States is still part of NATO and U.S. forces will
still be present in Europe. As an effective international organization
that upholds the norms of collective defense, [**NATO** will **tamp
down** any]{.mark} fears of a return to **[European power
politics]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Second, concerns of a resurgent German
hegemony in Europe are misplaced, because unlike pre-WWII, German
demographics point toward an aging population with a declining labor
productivity forecast. The declining productivity of the German
population will limit the technological advancement that is required to
become a military superpower. Third, the Basic Law of the Federal
Republic of Germany ([the **German Constitution**]{.underline})
[**closes** the **loopholes** for the reemergence of authoritarian
institutions through a separation of powers and a parliamentary
democracy. The new constitution also prohibits the suspension of
fundamental rights of the people of Germany under any circumstances
including national emergencies]{.underline} -- a marked difference from
the Weimar Constitution.

In a complex world, [NATO is **still relevant** and has a vital role in
guaranteeing European stability by keeping power politics at
bay]{.underline}. NATO has mitigated the reversion of European defense
policy to individual European states and brought about European
stability for over seven decades -- after two previous millennia of
conflict -- by allowing European countries to pass the buck of security
to NATO. European states were happy with this outcome because, in
addition to lasting peace, it allowed them to focus on their respective
domestic social policies rather than defense. Similarly, the United
States also benefited from NATO, given the expanded U.S. influence over
the foreign and military policies of European states. It was a win-win
situation as liberalist theories point, and it was an enduring factor
for the survival of NATO after the end of the Cold War, unlike the
winning grand military coalitions of the World Wars.

History illustrates an example of how [European leadership could
**save** the **alliance** while the United States is preoccupied with
other challenges]{.underline}. For example, when the United States was
fighting the Korean War in 1950 within the broader context of the Cold
War, West Germany stepped up under the leadership of Konrad Adenauer to
enhance European defense against the former Soviet Union. Even before
**[[Germany]{.underline}]{.mark}** formally joined NATO, West Germany
overcame a domestic "Ohne Mich" (without me) protest movement and made
the painful decision to rearm just four years after the Third Reich
ended, for the sake of European collective defense. This difficult
decision not only [[brought **credibility** to]{.mark} western
[**democratic** values]{.mark} when juxtaposed against the Soviet
communist values in eastern Europe, but it also [**heightened** NATO
**readiness**]{.mark} to take on the Soviet threat, even with the United
States occupied]{.underline} on the Korean Peninsula.

At a time when the world is becoming multipolar with the rise of China
along with the sustained Russian threats to European stability, German
Chancellor Angela Merkel is right to point out that [[Europe]{.mark} is
in [no]{.mark} position to [defend itself without
NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}. But NATO has a leadership crisis at hand, and
[Germany has a choice to step-up and calm the tempest by contributing
more towards the collective security agreement. Continuing with [the
**status quo** of depending on U.S.]{.mark} forces [will lead to the
**deterioration of NATO** and]{.mark} a probable return to the
[**renationalization** of **European** defense]{.mark} policies. On the
other hand, [**Germany** could revitalize the alliance, which would
enable NATO to be less dependent on U.S.]{.mark} forces [and]{.mark}
which would **[balance]{.mark}** the **[power]{.mark}** structure within
the alliance, thereby [**boosting** NATO's **credibility**]{.mark}. NATO
is critical to **peace** and **stability**]{.underline} in the Western
Hemisphere, [and Germany can ensure NATO persists in maintaining both of
these objectives]{.underline}.

[[Merz]{.underline}]{.mark}, an impassioned European and lifetime
Atlanticist, told a national television audience after his victory on
Sunday that it [would be his "**absolute [priority]{.mark}**"
[to]{.mark} help Europe "[achieve independence]{.mark} from the
USA"]{.underline}. He suggested that [[Nato]{.mark} in its current form
[might **no longer exist**]{.mark} by June]{.underline}, when the

earlier, he had said it might be [[time]{.mark} for Germany [to
participate in]{.mark} a European **nuclear
[deterrent]{.mark}**]{.underline} with France and the UK.

The incoming chancellor's outrage is as understandable as it is
astonishing. After all, the Trump administration has in just four weeks
overturned 80 years of post-second world war American foreign policy by
treating its allies like vassals and cosying up to its adversaries. On
Monday, it voted with Russia and against Ukraine and European countries
at the UN on an issue of Europe's security for the first time since
1945. Twice.

But what is required is action, not anger; and [a [security
severance]{.mark} from the US or a European nuclear deterrent are
[unrealistic]{.mark} goals. [Merz wants to]{.mark} conclude coalition
negotiations with the Social Democrats]{.underline} by Easter, which
falls in the second half of April. [He must try to launch a massive
[increase]{.mark} in [defence funding and]{.mark} reanimate Germany's
[relationships]{.mark} with its European partners]{.underline}.

[[He has]{.mark} to help forge [a Europe-wide plan to support Ukraine,

[boost]{.mark} its [competitiveness, reduce]{.mark} its [dependencies

President Trump's renewed 'offer' to buy Greenland is based on a
security argument that refers to the 'securitisation' of this
increasingly geopolitically important area, but is essentially out of
place. Greenland is not under threat, and neither does it pose a threat.
The United States, by contrast, have had all possible options to ensure
military security in Greenland since 1951. The doors are also wide open
for investors, which shows that [[**Trump**'s]{.mark} rhetoric is, once
again, flawed and unnecessarily [aggressive]{.mark}. [Germany]{.mark}
and its allies [must find ways to **deal** with this]{.mark} new
situation [and set their]{.mark} strategic **[priorities]{.mark}**
accordingly]{.underline}.

4 Recommendations

First and foremost, the author of this text, a veteran researcher,
strongly recommends to attract more researchers studying the Arctic and
its complex challenges and to create jobs for them. Even Denmark, as an
Arctic state, has too little security expertise. In Germany, Arctic
experts have long focused on the scientific side of things (which is
certainly not intended as a criticism of the very meritorious work of
the Alfred Wegener Institute). So, there is still much to be done for
research institutes and universities.

In terms of foreign policy, [[Germany will have to strengthen]{.mark}
and expand [its cooperation]{.mark} with the Arctic states if it wants
to be a relevant player in the Arctic-North Atlantic region and ensure
its security. Germany must **intensify** its cooperation]{.underline}
not only with Denmark, Finland and Sweden (in the Baltic and North Seas
and beyond), but also [[with]{.underline}]{.mark} Iceland, Canada,
Norway and [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}.
Furthermore, [[it should promote **closer relations**]{.mark} and
understanding]{.underline} with non-Arctic states such as France, Great
Britain and Japan as well as South Korea.38 [In terms of security,
[Germany needs **better** and more **comprehensive** situation
pictures]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the future, German maritime patrol
aircraft will probably not only operate from Lossiemouth in the far
north of Scotland, but will also be able to use the Kangerlussuaq
airfield in Greenland for surveillance flights between the Barents Sea
and the GIUK gap. This is a first step, but Germany will have to invest
even more in sensors and effectors suitable for the Arctic-North
Atlantic region in the future.

#### 'Say no' bolsters long-term solvency\-\--that [spills over]{.underline} into German confidence.

What kind of measures can restore trust?

[[Trust always involves]{.mark} a degree of [uncertainty]{.mark} and the
possibility of [disappointment]{.mark}]{.underline}. Nevertheless, [[it
also opens up more possibilities for action]{.underline}]{.mark}
because, as the sociologist Niklas Luhmann puts it, "[[trust provides a
more effective form of reducing complexity]{.underline}]{.mark}". Those
who act with confidence are optimistic about the future, which always
contains a multitude of certain and uncertain events. If calculated
rationally, [[risks cannot be eliminated, but they can be
**reduced**]{.underline}]{.mark}. According to Luhmann, such points of
reference can thus serve as a "stepping stone for jumping into a limited
and structured uncertainty".

According to its National Security Strategy, [[the **German** government
"supports]{.mark} **strategic [risk reduction]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the
fostering of [**predictability**, as well as]{.mark} the maintenance of
[**reliable** political and military channels of **communication** in
**relations**]{.mark}]{.underline} between NATO and Russia. \[It\]
remain\[s\] open to reciprocal transparency measures where the
prerequisites for them exist". [[This includes]{.mark} the
**development** of [new approaches]{.mark}]{.underline} based on
behavioural arms control [[that]{.mark} can help **[reduce
tensions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Although Friedrich [[Merz is]{.mark} considered [a]{.mark} **staunch
[transatlanticist]{.mark}**]{.underline}, relations with the US under
the new president, Donald Trump, are likely to be difficult. Trump has
repeatedly called for higher defense spending by Europeans, a criticism
that has been directed at Berlin in particular. "The Zeitenwende invoked
by Chancellor Scholz was a promising start," says US Senator Mitch
McConnell in an interview with WELT, "and Defense Minister Pistorius'
reforms have cleared the way for more rapid progress". However,
McConnell, who served as Republican leader from January 2007 to January
2025, says that [Germany\'s efforts "[to expand]{.mark} its
**[d]{.mark}**efense **[i]{.mark}**ndustrial **[b]{.mark}**ase [and
meet]{.mark} the pressing demands of **hard [power]{.mark}** -- like
those of my own government -- have been slower than today's challenges
require]{.underline}".

"[Incoming Chancellor Merz's leadership on [amending]{.mark} the [**debt
brake** suggests]{.mark} that [Germany's]{.mark} new government is
[prepared]{.mark} to make defense an enduring priority]{.underline}",
says McConnell, Chairman, Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense. "[I am
hopeful that [this]{.mark} progress [will **strengthen**]{.mark}
US-German [**cooperation** and the entire]{.mark} transatlantic
**[alliance]{.mark}**. As we face growing threats from aligned
adversaries, the [stakes]{.mark} of this endeavor [couldn't be
higher]{.mark}]{.underline}".

Jörn Fleck, senior director at the Atlantic Council in Washington,
criticizes the Trump administration\'s expectations of Berlin as "low to
non-existent". "In the best-case scenario, Germany is seen as a
complicated, backward-looking and ultimately irrelevant ally in
addressing key geopolitical challenges. In the worst-case scenario,
Germany is seen as arrogant, maintaining the miserable status quo and
acting like a free-riding parasite". However, [given [Berlin\'s
**influence**]{.mark} in Europe, these expectations [present]{.mark}
"good opportunities for a [**fresh start**" in
relations]{.mark}]{.underline}. Fleck believes that [[Merz will]{.mark}
be able to [use]{.mark} "[his]{.mark} **personal** and **political**
[history]{.mark} to his advantage" [with Trump]{.mark}: "With his
experience on **[Wall Street]{.mark}** and his **[conservative]{.mark}**
worldview, he favors clear language and direct political confrontation
over the German consensus culture, and he is [setting out to
**renew**]{.mark} [Europe\'s most important]{.mark} political and
economic **[power]{.mark}**]{.underline}".

Ken Weinstein, an expert at the Hudson Institute in Washington, also
expects a new beginning: "[Merz has the extraordinary [opportunity to be
the **first**]{.mark} European leader to pick up on the Trump
momentum]{.underline}". The expert advises that [he should first
**accept** Trump\'s **demand** for]{.underline} five percent [defense
spending. "[Germany must strengthen its own security and]{.mark}, at the
same time, [**develop** a **strategy** for greater]{.mark} European
independence and [leadership]{.mark}. This would [enable]{.mark} Germany
to strengthen European [deterrence while **allowing** the **US** to
**focus**]{.mark} increasingly [on]{.mark} the challenge posed by
[China]{.mark}"]{.underline}.

### Solvency\-\--AT: Germany Key\-\--AT: Say No\-\--2NC

#### Germany says yes. That's [vital]{.underline} for NATO unity and solves a European power vacuum.

**Pawlak** 4-7-20**22**, research associate at the Helmut Schmidt
University/University of the Federal Armed Forces Hamburg and the German
Institute for Defence and Strategic Studies (GIDS). His research covers
NATO's Northern Flank and the Baltic Sea region (Julian, "Security in
the Baltics: A Pivotal Moment for Germany?," *New Lines Institute*,
<https://newlinesinstitute.org/eurasia/security-in-the-baltics-a-pivotal-moment-for-germany/>)//BB

The Biden administration has more [[influence and
**cred**]{.mark}ibility, and a completely different reputation, [in
Germany]{.mark} than its predecessor did]{.underline}. [It [can
emphasize Germany's role for]{.mark}]{.underline} Baltic [defense
and]{.underline}, even more, for [[European security within]{.mark} the
contemporary **[great power]{.mark}** [competition]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Nevertheless, U.S. policymakers are advised to argue from an allied
perspective **rather than a bilateral one**]{.underline}]{.mark}. To
approach the Nord Stream 2 issue by sanctioning German companies
involved in the project could unintentionally push the narrative that
the U.S. is principally interested in selling its own liquefied natural
gas in Europe. To secure Baltic defense, [[NATO needs]{.mark} to present
[a strong]{.mark} and [united]{.mark} security
[approach]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[**Only** if this bond is robust can
the alliance expand its defense and deterrence
posture]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Yet NATO efforts in Eastern Europe are limited due to the NATO-Russia
Founding Act as well as the fact that a limitless stationing of NATO
forces in the Baltic Sea region would only fuel a Russian security
dilemma. Thus, a symmetric defense approach in relation to the force
level is neither possible nor logical. Instead, NATO should seek to
expand a broad deterrence-by-punishment approach -- including economic
and financial consequences as possibilities -- and explain that it would
outplay any aggression with its own global strengths. This could help
avoid the creation or escalation of a security dilemma for Russia and
create a comprehensive deterrence posture with combined elements of
denial and punishment. Germany and the U.S. both are crucial in that
regard. On the one hand, the U.S. remains the main security guarantor in
Europe. On the other, **[[Germany could step up regarding
European]{.underline}]{.mark}** and Baltic
**[[defense]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[take **more responsibility** with
its European partners]{.underline}]{.mark}, and address the challenges
together with the U.S. in a more even-tempered manner. Above all,
[[its]{.underline}]{.mark} economic, commercial, and political
[[potential could **strengthen**]{.mark} a [broad allied
deterrence]{.mark} approach [significantly]{.mark}]{.underline}. After
all, [[Germany has]{.mark} the [support from]{.mark} its European and
transatlantic [allies to fulfill those
expectations]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Its new political leadership just
needs to **make use** of that support, and **the U.S. is in the
position** to **encourage**]{.mark} **[it]{.mark}**]{.underline}s
transatlantic friends wisely.

This is all at odds with the [[German public]{.underline}]{.mark}, whose
**[[support]{.underline}]{.mark}** for Ukraine [[has remained
**high**]{.underline}]{.mark}, said Timo Graf, a senior researcher at
the Bundeswehr Center of Military History and Social Sciences in
Potsdam.

Graf and his colleagues have conducted frequent polls showing that
German security concerns went up in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea and
openly supported insurrections in Ukraine's eastern regions of Luhansk
and Donetsk.

That [support **shot up** in 2022, with Russia's full
invasion]{.underline}. Graf's polls suggested that [more than 60 percent
of Germans thought Russia was a direct threat to German
security]{.underline}.

"Things have to get personal. There's no altruism at work here," said
Graf. "[[The **higher** the **threat perception**, the higher the
support for]{.mark} NATO's eastern flank or for defence
spending]{.underline}."

About [60 percent of Germans polled in favour of higher defence spending
and 50 percent for supporting NATO's eastern flank in 2022]{.underline}.

Those numbers dropped a little last year as Ukraine won back territory,
but had risen again by February this year, said Graf. Support for
helping Ukraine is back to 60 percent, [and support for **[increased
defence]{.mark}** spending has [shot up to more than **70
percent**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Yet the German coalition government has just approved a budget for next
year that cuts support for Ukraine in half and gives Defence Minister
Boris Pistorius an overall 1.2 billion-euro (\$1.3bn) increase in the
budget -- far short of the 6.7 billion-euro (\$7.2bn) increase he asked
for.

Christian Schlaga, Germany's ambassador to Estonia from 2015 to 2019,
said it "is barely covering the cost from wage rises".

He believed [German [politicians' **overcautiousness**]{.mark} was
[creating]{.mark} a [dangerous]{.mark} feedback [loop]{.mark} of false
reassurance]{.underline}.

"[It [needs to be **underlined**]{.mark} in a **[much stronger]{.mark}**
way and more often [that]{.mark}]{.underline} if Ukraine falls and the
Russian army stands on the border with Poland, [[we have a serious
problem]{.underline}]{.mark}," said Schlaga.

"[[If the government went **forward**]{.mark} **strongly** [with]{.mark}
such [an argument]{.mark}, then [the public would]{.mark} also
[respond]{.mark} to it [with]{.mark} a **greater
[understanding]{.mark}** of why we actually need to do what]{.underline}

is]{.mark} **firmly** on the side of [increased defense
funding]{.mark}]{.underline}, with a survey earlier this year finding
that 68 percent of respondents favored higher spending. It is an opinion
shared by German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, who has repeatedly
stated that "we need to spend more money." [How much [money is]{.mark}
an **[open]{.mark} question**]{.underline}. But in 2023, the
Commissioner for the Armed Forces, Eva Högl, stated that the special
military fund needed to be increased to \$300 billion. For reference,
[[Germany's]{.underline}]{.mark} 2024 defense budget was just over fifty
billion euros. When it takes form, [the next government will be [able to
weigh what's needed]{.mark} and what's feasible, but it will have to
reckon with a simple truth: [its days of an **underfunded** military are
**over**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

After the February elections, two factors will shape how Germany
approaches its defense spending. First, President [Trump]{.underline}
will be back in office and [wants Germany to provide its fair share of
NATO obligations. These days, threats to European security mean that
'fair share' is closer to four percent of GDP than two]{.underline}.
Second, [[with]{.mark} the potential for a negotiated settlement to the

struggled for years. The basic situation -- that Germany's armed forces
have 20,000 positions unfilled across the board -- has changed little,
as personnel numbers have been stagnant for years. Moreover, the
Bundeswehr is heading for a demographic dropout at the end of the
decade, when baby boomers retire from service and cannot be replaced by
the significantly lower numbers of school graduates. Nevertheless, the
German government remains critical of the concept of a mandatory social
service year; support comes primarily from Christian Democratic circles.

In any event, obliging young people to Bundeswehr (or, alternatively,
other types of) service would do little to fill positions that require
well-trained specialists. Nonetheless, [a [social service year]{.mark}
could be a [catalyst for]{.mark} larger portions of future
[generations]{.mark} to come into contact with the Bundeswehr and
discover a new professional arena. **Experience** prior to the
suspension of compulsory military service **has shown** that this
service had [led to larger numbers of]{.mark} young [people signing
up]{.mark} **for longer terms** as regular or professional soldiers in
the Bundeswehr building on the experiences they had gained during their
year of service. [This is the]{.mark} Bundeswehr's [chance to **change**
the **trend** in personnel numbers]{.mark} -- the social service year
could also contribute to [attracting]{.mark} the
**[specialists]{.mark}** that the German armed forces so desperately
need]{.underline}. Moreover, mandatory service could grow Germany's
reserve, which, given Germany's increased NATO commitments, must be
deeply integrated into active units so that it can perform security duty
in the rear of large units when these are deployed in potential conflict
areas.

[A social service year could also [form the **nucleus**]{.mark} **of
efforts** to achieve closer interlinkages between the Bundeswehr and
German society at large, as well as aid in the establishment [of]{.mark}
a strategic [culture]{.mark}. After years of the German public being
alienated from security policy realities, there is now a need for a
broad engagement of society with the armed forces, and with defence
policy issues]{.underline}. This engagement must be guided by a
political leadership that tells the public uncomfortable truths and
clears away the culture of extreme military restraint. German
policymakers must explain, in their communication efforts, that the
global threat level has massively increased due to burgeoning great
power rivalries; that peace, stability, and the international order are
being challenged by autocratic systems, and must be defended; that this
defence cannot only take the form of de-escalation and diplomacy, but
occasionally also of military force, when needed. [A strategic culture
must therefore [perceive deterrence]{.mark} and defence [as]{.mark}
**fundamental political [tasks]{.mark}**, which is the raison d'être of
armed forces in democratic states]{.underline}. Only if this awareness
catches on can Germany's Zeitenwende succeed in the long term.

[Our [study of]{.mark} **official [Russian statements]{.mark}** [on
NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} between 2014 and 2021 (Wilhelmsen and Hjermann
2022) has [[shown that Russian discourse entrenched an understanding of
NATO as]{.mark} **[hostile, deceptive and]{.mark} constantly [engaged in
waging]{.mark}**]{.underline} hybrid [**[warfare]{.mark}** against
Russia]{.underline}. In effect, [[the rhetoric left no room for Russia
viewing]{.mark} any [NATO action as defensive]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[That]{.underline}]{.mark} such a [[**false sense of certainty** is
conducive to military conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}, [as shown in
Russia's war on Ukraine]{.underline}, [can be understood]{.underline}
through a constructivist reading [of the 'security
dilemma'.]{.underline}

In its classic formulation by Jervis (1978), [the 'security dilemma'
explains how **[defensive measures can lead to unintended
consequences]{.mark}** and unwanted conflict]{.underline}, in which
steps intended to increase security have the opposite effect. While this
defensive realist version sees the security dilemma as rooted in
uncertainty as lack of information, a constructivist reading sees social
reality as intersubjectively constituted, and uncertainty as a matter of
interpretation: [[states come to know each other as]{.mark} defensive or
[hostile through]{.mark} social, discursive and processual
[interaction]{.mark}, leaving political entities with very limited
control over how their actions are interpreted]{.underline} (Mitzen
2006). [In reading their adversaries' actions, political actors may
**discount the uncertainty** involved in making interpretations, and
arrive at a '**misplaced certainty'**]{.underline} (Mitzen and Schweller
2011), creating a particularly acute 'securitisation dilemma' (Van
Rythoven 2020). [We build on this scholarship to argue that [**intense
and repeated political agitation** that depicts the Other as threatening
misleads actors to discount uncertainty, fostering the]{.mark}
epistemological [hubris that they 'know']{.mark} [their
adversaries]{.mark}.]{.underline} Russian official rhetoric after 2014
appears to have fostered such hubris (Wilhelmsen and Hjermann 2022).

[In the years leading up to its full-scale war in Ukraine, the [Russian
leadership]{.mark} cultivated a '**conspiracy theory'**, [**victimising
Russia** as the target of]{.mark} an incessant geopolitical [expansion
drive by]{.mark} the USA/ [NATO]{.mark}.]{.underline} The events of 24
February 2022 have clearly shown that Putin's Russia is a ruthless
aggressor, but the [Moscow's repeated narrative of being under attack
from NATO has, we find, [reinforced the perceived certainty of a hostile
environment]{.mark} that paved the way for the 2022 re-invasion of
Ukraine.]{.underline}

Russian Domestic Context

Political and economic factors inside Russia are also likely to shape
Russian [reactions to **NATO posture enhancements**]{.underline}. Our
research [suggests]{.underline} that [changes in the]{.underline} extent
of [threats to Russian **regime legitimacy**]{.underline}, the [power
and **composition** of the Russian elite]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
Putin's personal preferences could all affect [Russian's **foreign
policy** choices.]{.underline}

Extent of Threats to Regime Legitimacy

Threats to a regime's hold on power can change a state's foreign policy,
although whether it makes the state more or less aggressive appears to
vary depending on the circumstances. In some cases, domestic unrest can
prompt senior officials to adopt more-peaceful policies in order to
focus resources on internal threats or even to gain help from an outside
power in restoring order.48 In other cases, [crises of legitimacy can
lead statesmen to **provoke crises**]{.underline} [or pursue **riskier
foreign policies**]{.underline} in order [to **divert** public attention
from problems]{.underline} [at home or]{.underline} to restore public
unity.49 It should be noted that how frequently and under what
circumstances this type of diversionary foreign policy occurs in
practice remains contested in the academic literature.50

[Threatened regimes]{.underline} may also be more [willing to
**intervene** in]{.underline} the [domestic politics of
neighboring]{.underline} **[states]{.underline}**. There is evidence
that anti-regime protests and [**democracy movements** in one
state]{.underline} [can make similar movements in neighboring
states]{.underline} more likely, and [this]{.underline} [appears to be a
**substantial concern** of Russia]{.underline}, particularly with regard
to former Soviet states.51 Antiregime and democratic groups may be
inspired by or learn about the tactics of groups in a nearby state.52
Intentional actions by foreign governments or nongovernmental groups can
also facilitate these movements by spreading ideas, technology, and
resources.53 Although such movements are rarely effective in achieving
regime change or democratization,54 concern about such movements can
lead statesmen to intervene abroad to stop sources of instability at
their origin.55

[Regime insecurity]{.underline} [remains a **pressing concern** for
Russian leaders]{.underline}, and in the current context, it is likely
to lead to more-competitive, rather than more-cooperative, Russian
responses to [NATO posture enhancements]{.underline}. Mass protests and
rioting in Russia, motivated by economic hardship and government
corruption, have [made **regime security** a **concern** in recent
years]{.underline}.56

Higher-Risk Alternative Futures

As discussed earlier, it is important to consider not only the most
likely scenario but also less likely but plausible ones that would
involve substantially greater risks if they came to pass. This section
details two alternative [scenarios]{.underline} that have the potential
to materially [increase]{.underline} the [risk of **direct
confrontation** between Russia and]{.underline} [NATO]{.underline} by
affecting one or more of the identified key factors. The first scenario,
labeled Russia Lashes Out, [focuses on changes to Russian **regime
legitimacy**]{.underline} or elite preferences, most likely triggered by
economic shifts. The second scenario, labeled Weakened West, focuses on
[changes in Russian perceptions of **NATO's willingness**]{.underline}
or ability [to defend its eastern members, triggered by]{.underline}
either **[Western political developments]{.underline}** or external
crises. Although these alternative futures are presented as distinct
scenarios, in practice, aspects of the two could easily merge. As we
have noted, we developed these scenarios precisely to [illustrate
plausible]{.underline}, though unlikely, [pathways]{.underline} [to a
greater risk]{.underline} [of **conflict** between **Russia and
NATO.**]{.underline}

Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine has ignited the largest war in
Europe since the Second World War, indiscriminately spilling the blood
of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers and innocent civilians. Russian
president Vladimir [Putin]{.underline} [wants]{.underline} [you to
**believe** that **NATO is to blame**]{.underline}. [He]{.underline} has
[frequently claimed that]{.underline} **[NATO
expansion]{.underline}**---not the 200,000 Russian soldiers and sailors
attacking Ukraine's ports, airfields, roads, railways, and cities---[is
the **central driver** of this]{.underline} [crisis]{.underline}.
Following John Mearsheimer's provocative 2014 Foreign Affairs article
arguing that "the Ukraine crisis is the West's fault," the [narrative of
**Russian backlash**]{.underline} [against NATO]{.underline}
[expansion]{.underline} has [become]{.underline} a [**dominant
fra**mework for]{.underline} explaining---if not
**[justifying]{.underline}**---[Moscow's]{.underline} ongoing [war
against **Ukraine**]{.underline}.1 This notion has been repeated not
only in Moscow but in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere by
politicians, analysts, and writers. Multiple [rounds of
**enlargement**]{.underline}, they argue, [exacerbated]{.underline}
[Russia's sense of **insecurity** as NATO forces crept
**closer**]{.underline} [to Russia's borders]{.underline}, finally
[provoking Putin to **lash out**]{.underline} violently, [first by
invading **Georgia**]{.underline} in 2008, [then
**Ukraine**]{.underline} in 2014, and now a second, likely far larger,
invasion of Ukraine today. By this telling, the specter of Ukraine's
NATO membership points both to the cause of the conflict and its
solution: Take membership off the table for Ukraine, so the argument
goes, and future wars will be prevented.

[The NATO]{.underline} [summit]{.underline} held this week in The Hague
[marks]{.underline} a [**dangerous turning point** in world
politics]{.underline}. Seventy-five years after its founding, [the
**imperialist alliance**]{.underline} of 32 member states has [pledged
to spend at least **5 percent** of GDP on the military]{.underline}.
This [buildup]{.underline} is directed n[ot only against Russia and
China]{.underline}---[it targets the]{.underline} [**working class** in
**every country**]{.underline}.

The summit took place just days after the illegal US-Israeli bombardment
of Iran and in the midst of the ongoing genocide in Gaza. It
[coincided]{.underline} [with NATO's]{.underline} escalating [proxy war
against Russia in **Ukraine**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} mounting
[preparations for **military confrontation** with]{.underline} China.
[Behind the cynical rhetoric of]{.underline} "defense" and
"**[deterrence]{.underline}**" [lies]{.underline} [the reality that
NATO]{.underline} [is preparing for **global war**]{.underline} and the
violent redivision of the world.

The 5 percent target is a qualitative shift. All [NATO]{.underline}
[members]{.underline} are now committed to this benchmark,
[effectively]{.underline} [transforming]{.underline} [the alliance into
a permanent **war economy**]{.underline}. The goal is to increase
military-related spending from the current 2 percent to 5 percent of GDP
within the next decade. Of this, 3.5 percent would be allocated to
traditional military expenditures, such as troops and weaponry, while an
additional 1.5 percent would be directed toward broader initiatives like
cybersecurity, infrastructure and the construction of military
facilities.

This rearmament drive would raise NATO's collective military spending
from \$1.5 trillion in 2024 to \$2.8 trillion---a near doubling of war
spending, not accounting for inflation or economic growth. That figure
alone would exceed the entire annual GDP of countries such as Canada or
Italy.

For Britain, which has a current military budget of around £60 billion,
the 5 percent benchmark would mean an increase to approximately £140
billion annually---more than doubling defense expenditures.

For Germany, the implications are even more far-reaching. The ruling
class is preparing to raise military spending from roughly 2 percent to
5 percent of GDP by 2029, reaching €225 billion annually. With the €100
billion "special fund" passed in 2022 and over €1 trillion in additional
military packages outlined this year, German imperialism is determined
to resume a "leadership role" on the world stage.

In his government statement prior to the summit, Chancellor Friedrich
Merz stressed that Germany's militarization was not merely acting at
Trump's behest, but acting on the basis of its "its own convictions and
beliefs." Germany, he declared, would "make the Bundeswehr the strongest
conventional army in Europe," as was rightly expected "given our size,
our economic power, and our geographical location." Merz added that
Germany must now "actively and directly represent our interests" and
"shape the geopolitical environment in which we live."

In plain language: Germany is returning to a policy of militarism and
great power politics, despite its historic crimes in World War I and
World War II.

The [implementation of]{.underline} these [war plans]{.underline} and
budgets [requires]{.underline} a massive [**redistribution** of wealth
from the **working class**]{.underline} [to the capitalist **oligarchy**
and the]{.underline} **[military-industrial complex]{.underline}**.
[Trillions]{.underline} of euros and dollars [are being
funneled]{.underline} [into armaments]{.underline}, [while]{.underline}
[public services are]{.underline} systematically
**[gutted]{.underline}**. [Healthcare]{.underline},
[education]{.underline}, pensions, housing, [and other basic **social
protections**]{.underline} [are]{.underline} [to be **destroyed** to pay
for **war**.]{.underline}

This agenda cannot be carried out democratically. [To
**suppress**]{.underline} the inevitable [**opposition** from
workers]{.underline} and youth, [authoritarian]{.underline}
[forms]{.underline} [of rule are]{.underline} being prepared and
[implemented across **all** NATO member states.]{.underline}

The alliance's [subservience to]{.underline} the fascist US President
Donald **[Trump]{.underline}** was [on full display in The
Hague]{.underline}. European leaders bent over backwards to affirm their
loyalty to Trump and the United States. [NATO]{.underline}
Secretary-General Mark Rutte, in particular, lavished praise on
Trump---reportedly even [referring to him as "**daddy**."]{.underline}
The [EU powers]{.underline} [are]{.underline} not acting as cautious or
less aggressive counterweights to US imperialism. On the contrary, they
are [full]{.underline} and willing [**partners** in a global program of
**militarism**]{.underline}, repression and barbarism.

Amid the chorus of unity, however, [**deep divisions** within the
**imperialist camp** are also surfacing]{.underline}. The [NATO powers
are rearming together]{.underline}---[but]{.underline} they are [also
preparing for **conflict with one another**]{.underline}. As in the
run-up to World War I and World War II, [competition]{.underline} [for
markets]{.underline}, resources and global [influence]{.underline} [is
**intensifying**]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} very [same
**contradictions**]{.underline} [driving]{.underline} [the alliance into
war with Russia and China are]{.underline} also [fueling
inter-imperialist]{.underline} [rivalries]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} [threaten to **tear NATO apart.**]{.underline}

The [drive to war]{.underline} abroad is [**inseparably**
linked]{.underline} [to the war against the **working
class**]{.underline} at home. Just as in the early 20th century, the
[capitalist]{.underline} [ruling]{.underline} [classes]{.underline} are
[responding to **internal crises**]{.underline}---[economic stagnation,
social unrest and]{.underline} collapsing political
[legitimacy]{.underline}---[by turning to **war**]{.underline} and
dictatorship.

But while the capitalist system hurtles toward a third world war, the
[same]{.underline} fundamental [contradictions]{.underline} that give
rise to imperialist conflict [also create the objective basis for
**socialist revolution**]{.underline}. [The
**contradiction**]{.underline} [between]{.underline} a [globally
integrated economy]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the nation-state
system, and the [conflict]{.underline} [between]{.underline} the social
character of [modern production]{.underline} [and]{.underline} its
[**subordination** to private profit, **cannot** be resolved
within]{.underline} the framework of [capitalism]{.underline}.

This is what makes the present situation so explosive. [**Resistance is
mounting** around the world. Mass protests against]{.underline} the
[genocide in Gaza]{.underline} have swept through every continent.
[Workers are striking in record numbers]{.underline} against austerity
and wage suppression. And in the United States, [opposition to
Trump]{.underline} and the turn to dictatorship has reached
**[unprecedented]{.underline}** levels. The protests against Trump two
weeks ago involved more than 15 million people, the largest mass
demonstrations in US history.

[What is]{.underline} urgently [required is]{.underline} the
[transformation]{.underline} [of this]{.underline} opposition
[into]{.underline} [a]{.underline} conscious [political
movement]{.underline} of the working class, armed [with a
**revolutionary socialist program**]{.underline}. The fight against
militarism and war and the defense of democratic and social rights are
inseparable from the struggle to overthrow the capitalist system.

[Stopping the drive to world war]{.underline} [means]{.underline}
[fighting to **abolish NATO**]{.underline}, [dismantle the]{.underline}
imperialist [war machine, and]{.underline} [place]{.underline} the vast
[wealth]{.underline} and productive forces of society
[under]{.underline} the [**democratic control** of the working
class.]{.underline} This is the program of the International Committee
of the Fourth International (ICFI). Its affiliated Socialist Equality
Parties around the world must now be built as the new revolutionary
leadership of the international working class.

[From its founding]{.underline} moment, [NATO was an aggressive
**military apparatus**]{.underline} [to coordinate]{.underline} the
[police and military and intelligence apparati]{.underline} among the
ten founding West European member countries (plus U.S. and Canada) under
U.S. command. [NATO's]{.underline} [past 30 years of]{.underline} steady
[expansion is tied to its **original purpose** as an **imperialist
weapon** against the **working class.**]{.underline}

The 1991 broken promise by Secretary of State Baker, echoed by many
other Western politicians, to Soviet Prime Minister Gorbachev that if
the reunification of Germany went forward "NATO would expand not one
inch to the East" is often quoted today in discussing the encirclement
of Russia and the root of the war in Ukraine.

What needs to be understood is why did NATO expand? Why was NATO's
expansion inevitable?

[NATO expanded]{.underline} [because]{.underline} the [**capitalist
markets** expanded]{.underline}. [The defeat of
**socialism**]{.underline} in Eastern Europe [and]{.underline} the
[dismemberment of the Soviet Union]{.underline} and the auctioning off
of formerly nationalized public property and industries [was only
possible with an **enforcement organization**]{.underline}.

Just as [the U.S., as]{.underline} the [center **of finance capital**,
is held together by the **largest** repressive **state apparatus**, the
largest internal police force]{.underline}, and the largest prison
system in the world.

[NATO's]{.underline} **[founding principle]{.underline}** [was to
ensure]{.underline} a [strong U.S. military]{.underline}, political [and
**economic presence** in Europe]{.underline}. There was no plan to end
the U.S. military occupation of Europe. Its stated purpose from its
inception was a military alliance against the Soviet Union.

NATO claimed to be a collective security arrangement against Soviet
expansion, even though the Soviet Union was hardly expanding. It was
devastated by World War II and had suffered the overwhelming majority of
the losses in human life (27 million) and in industrial capacity. Over
700 cities and towns lay in total ruin. Refugee camps and rationing
dominated daily life.

The border between two social systems

But the fact that the Soviet Union had survived was threatening to the
capitalist class.

In all the countries liberated by the Red Army from Nazi Germany's
occupation in Eastern Europe workers organizations were attempting to
reorganize society. [Only by organizing]{.underline} [on a
**non-capitalist basis** could they defend their countries from
**absorption** by Western **imperialism**.]{.underline}

Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill had spoken in Missouri
in 1946 denouncing this development and labeling it an Iron Curtain
dividing Europe. His speech was a rallying cry to wall off all economic
trade and technological assistance to the entire region the Red Army had
liberated.

Socialism in Western Europe?

Capitalist domination of Western Europe was in question. What was
labeled as Soviet expansion, imminent Soviet invasion, the Red Scare
(with a media frenzy that matches today's against Russia), was the
growing influence of workers' movements in Western Europe.

[The organized]{.underline} power of the [working class and of Communist
parties was **rapidly growing** in national parliaments, city councils
and powerful unions in war-torn Western Europe, especially in Italy and
France. Communists had]{.underline} been the largest force in resistance
to the Nazis during the years of German occupation.

In Greece the Communist Party, who had led the anti-fascist resistance,
was openly contending for state power. From 1945 to 1949, U.S. and
British active intervention in the Civil War in Greece, equipping and
helping to coordinate the weak rightwing and monarchist forces, was
crucial for defeating the Greek workers' movement.

This Civil War helped convince the West European ruling class to follow
the U.S. into a continent-wide military organization of the capitalist
class.

A security umbrella for capitalism

[NATO]{.underline} was [understood as a **security
umbrella**]{.underline} [of Western]{.underline} European **[imperialist
countries]{.underline}**. [It had]{.underline}, from its founding, [a
consolidated command]{.underline} structure, [with the U.S. military
**on top.**]{.underline}

U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the first Supreme Allied Commander
Europe (SACEUR), was the commander of this new military alliance.
U.S.-commanded [NATO]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the [Marshall
Plan]{.underline} of U.S. [loans]{.underline} and investment funds
together [**stabilized capitalism** in Western Europe and]{.underline}
[assured U.S. **corporate domination**]{.underline}.

The pre-World War II industrial capacity of much of the world was in
ruins. [Military security]{.underline} [was]{.underline} [the essential
**glue** in Western Europe, binding]{.underline} the [**economic** and
**political** dominance of **capitalist rule.**]{.underline}

For decades [NATO]{.underline} and the CIA [operated]{.underline}
throughout Western Europe, in tandem with the U.S. State Department,
[disrupting]{.underline} **[communist-led unions]{.underline}**,
[financing interventions]{.underline} [in elections and]{.underline}
even [using **terror attacks** against]{.underline} communists and
**[socialist organizations]{.underline}** and against the masses.

#### NATO military operations undergird attempts to [sustain]{.underline} Western capitalism.

In the past few weeks, [there has been]{.underline} a lot of [noise
about **instability**]{.underline} [in]{.underline} the
[NATO]{.underline} military alliance. The [EU is up in arms
about]{.underline} **[Trump's diplomacy]{.underline}** with Putin and US
pronouncements that they may not defend NATO allies slacking on defence
spending. Tánaiste Simon Harris said "a gulf has emerged between the
United States and European Union" in terms of the issue of Ukraine.
"[We've now got an alliance between a Russian president]{.underline}
[who wants to **destroy Europe** and an American president]{.underline}
who also wants to destroy Europe" one senior EU diplomat told Politico,
adding "the transatlantic alliance is dead."\[1\]

We have been here before. In May 2017, [Trump came to
Brussels]{.underline}, meeting many EU leaders for the first time. He
said NATO allies must pay their fair share for their collective defence
and increase military spending to 2% of GDP. The [EU]{.underline}
[responded]{.underline} [with]{.underline} [talk about European
"**strategic autonomy**]{.underline}" and being capable of going it
alone. The rhetoric at the time was about Trump, Putin, Erdoğan and
Brexit giving the EU a wake-up call about the need to beef up defence.
[Trump was **supposedly distancing** the US from
long-standing]{.underline} transatlantic [cooperation as a result of his
America First policy]{.underline}. He was an unreliable character, and
then there was the Russia-gate hoax.

This was the backdrop to PESCO. A European Defence fund was established,
Joint funding of battle groups aimed to integrate EU militaries, joint
procurement of weapons and a host of other initiatives were cooked up.
When it was all sorted and agreed in record time, there was a NATO-EU
summit in December 2017 where there were smiles and celebrations all
round. It was talked about in terms of a spirit of rapprochement between
US/NATO and the EU. Apparently all it took to repair this supposed rift
was for the EU to turn itself into a military union, just like Trump had
asked\[2\].

[EU military spending **flatlined**]{.underline} in the decade [leading
up to 2016]{.underline}. In 2006 it stood at €154 billion, in 2016 it
was €155 billion. Trump criticises the EU and the curve takes off. By
the end of last year we were up to €326 billion, or 1.9 percent of EU
GDP. Just in time for Trump and the Republicans to come back and say ok
let's go higher. Again we're presented with mixed messaging: Trump is
unreliable, look at how he is with Putin, screwing over Ukraine. Yet in
reality the boss of NATO has given the orders and the EU has answered
"yes Sir, how high Sir?"

Following these developments it is instructive to consider the views of
Trump's nomination for under secretary of defense for policy, Elbridge
Colby. In both his 2021 book and in recent articles Colby puts forward
his vision for American conservative realism. According to
[Colby]{.underline} the US has limitations it must recognise and as such
should avoid pursuing full spectrum dominance. American "primacism" must
be rejected in favour of a coalition of strong like-minded allies.
"Conservatism is all about a state recognizing its own proper limits and
thus other entities' legitimate spheres for their own power and
responsibility"\[3\], he [writes]{.underline}. [The US must focus
its]{.underline} limited [abilities on the real challenge to US
interests -- **China**]{.underline} -- [and push allies]{.underline} [to
**build strength**]{.underline} and look after their own spheres of
interest to better facilitate the collective sabotage of Chinese
development.

On 19th March 2025, [the EU Commission adopted a "**White
Paper**]{.underline}" [strategy for advancing European rearmament at
unprecedented levels]{.underline}. Apparently [threats to Europe
abound]{.underline}: [Russia is about to **invade Europe**,]{.underline}
big bad [**China** is on the rise]{.underline}, [EU
interests]{.underline} [are **challenged everywhere**]{.underline} we
look, and [the only **rational response** is **colossal military
spending**]{.underline}. In this vision, [**diplomacy** or peace are
**not options**]{.underline}. Oddly enough, this strategy was published
during ongoing US, Russia and Ukraine ceasefire negotiations.

Our [governments will feed]{.underline} us whatever propaganda and
[**fear-mongering**]{.underline} works [to build consensus
for]{.underline} taking money from pensions, health and
[social]{.underline} security [systems and squandering it on the
**machinery of death**]{.underline}. [Germany]{.underline} has just
[amended]{.underline} [the **debt brake** to]{.underline} [allow
**hundreds of billions** on defence spendin]{.underline}g. In the
beginning of March, Commission President von der Leyen presented her
plan for "ReArm Europe" -- a package of measures that envisage EU
defence spending rising to 3.5% of GDP (€650 billion). A €150 billion
loan fund for defence sector investments was also announced.

The EU is doing exactly what Trump and his team have asked them to do.
[NATO is building strength through **division of labour**]{.underline}.
[Their goal is clear]{.underline}: [the decimation of the Chinese
economy]{.underline} at all costs. [They are laying the
groundwork]{.underline} [for **imperialist aggression**]{.underline} [by
the West]{.underline} and its proxies [against China and the global
South, to **crush**]{.underline} [the possibility of an **alternative**
to **genocidal**, world destroying, **Western-dominated
capitalism**.]{.underline}

Securitizing Russia in the Arctic,\" No Publication,

[The Arctic's shift into a **contested space**]{.underline} has
[compromised NATO's "**self**" rooted]{.underline} [in]{.underline} its
[foundational purpose as a united]{.underline}, [reliable]{.underline},
[and **values-driven** collective defense alliance]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} its "[identity]{.underline}" [as]{.underline} a
[promoter of **stable borders**]{.underline}. Based on Browning and
Joenniemi (2017), [emphasizing]{.underline} the distinction between self
and identity has been crucial for understanding the adaptability and
reflexivity of NATO to address external pressures in times of
ontological insecurity. [To alleviate]{.underline} its
**[anxieties]{.underline}** [regarding]{.underline} the [evolving
dynamics in the Arctic]{.underline}, [NATO]{.underline} has
[reevaluated]{.underline} the nature of its [relationship with
**Russia** and]{.underline} its **[Arctic strategy]{.underline}**.
[It]{.underline} has [readjusted]{.underline} its post-Cold War
"[cooperative security" focus to]{.underline} a more security-oriented
role to enhance its deterrence capacities by [conducting **large
military exercises**]{.underline}, [increasing]{.underline} [defense
spending, and]{.underline} encouraging Finnish and Swedish membership,
namely **[deterrence-by-denial]{.underline}** (Wieslander, Adamson and
Lehto 2023). Such an identity shift has reflected the Alliance's
reflexivity and adaptability to preserve a consistent self rather than
simple strategic defense needs for NATO.

To reaffirm its collective self, [NATO]{.underline} has also [used
securitization]{.underline} [as]{.underline} [a
**discursive**]{.underline} and practical [tool to present]{.underline}
[the Arctic as]{.underline} [a]{.underline} potential [ground for
**conflict** with Russia]{.underline}. Drawing on its autobiographic
narratives embedded in shared myths, selected tragedies, and glories,
[NATO]{.underline} has ide[ntified Russia as an "abject"]{.underline},
namely other/enemy, [to transform its **existential anxieties** into
manageable **concrete threats**]{.underline} (Kinnvall 2004; Gellwitzki
and Houde 2023). The emphasis on intersubjectiveness that enables the
conceptualization of anxiety as a relational and interpersonal
phenomenon (Mitzen 2006a; Gustafsson and Krickel-Choi 2020) is crucial
to understanding the transformation of political issues
intersubjectively into security issues.

From an ontological security perspective coupled with the securitization
approach, this article examines why Russia's engagement in the Arctic
and the Russian invasion of Ukraine has endangered the [Alliance's
ontological security]{.underline}, [leading]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} its symbolic and [**strategic engagement** in the
region]{.underline}. The ontological security perspective offers
valuable insights to examine how [NATO]{.underline} has unconsciously
[identified the Arctic as]{.underline} more than short-term security
concerns or a mere location for physical defense but as [a **symbolic
significance** to reaffirm its]{.underline} unity, [stability, and
strategic]{.underline} [posture]{.underline}. On the other hand, the
securitization perspective provides a useful framework for examining how
[NATO]{.underline}, seeking to address material threats, [has
**intentionally securitized** Russia in the Arctic through **speech
acts** and strategic measures.]{.underline}
