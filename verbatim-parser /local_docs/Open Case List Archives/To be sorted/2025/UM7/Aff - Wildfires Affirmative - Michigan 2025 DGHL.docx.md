# 1AC -- Wildfires

### Advantage 1 is Wildfires

#### The Arctic is [burning]{.underline}. Climate change has created a [positive feedback loop]{.underline} lengthening fire season and making fires more frequent and severe, whilst releasing massive amounts of greenhouse gases.

**Arctic Council, 22** (Arctic Council, A new format to strengthen
Arctic wildland fire cooperation, 3/1/22,

//RM)

The Arctic Wildland Fire Sharing Circle brought together diverse voices
to share projects, tools and research to start new conversations and
build networks to tackle Arctic wildland fires.

"[We have had a front row seat to an Arctic on fire]{.underline} -- [a
precursor to a world of flame."]{.underline} These words were spoken by
Edward Alexander, Co-Chair of Gwich'in Council International, as he set
the scene for scientists, State representatives, Indigenous Peoples, and
other experts and interested parties that gathered to discuss an
increasingly pressing issue -- wildland fires in the Arctic. In recent
years, [Arctic wildfires have increased in frequency and
intensity]{.underline}. While fire is a natural part of Arctic
ecosystems, the changing nature of wildland [fires]{.underline} has
[brought]{.underline} [challenges]{.underline} [that require
greater]{.underline} collaboration, [knowledge sharing and
partnership]{.underline} around the circumpolar North. The Arctic
Council is addressing the issue of wildland fires with several projects
related to topics such as wildfire ecology, monitoring and emergency
prevention, preparedness and response. To bring these often-intersecting
topics together, and to learn about related projects and ideas, a
Sharing Circle event was held at the end of 2021. The Sharing Circle
consisted of keynotes, presentation sessions, questions and reflections
spread over two days, with breakout sessions at the end of each day,
enabling projects and organizations to learn and share highlights of
their work, driving questions and opportunities for involvement. "This
Sharing Circle is a unique opportunity for experts, knowledge holders,
project leaders and interested parties to join together and share and
discover the ongoing work and innovative projects related to our common
issue of Arctic wildfires," said Nikolay Korchunov, then Chair of the
Arctic Council Senior Arctic Officials (2021-2023). "It's an important
effort to identify synergies between initiatives, bring the right minds
and resources together to address this issue in a holistic and cross
sectoral manner." The Arctic Council Working Groups Conservation of
Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF) and Emergency Prevention, Preparedness and
Response (EPPR), in collaboration with Permanent Participant Gwich'in
Council International (GCI) organized the Arctic Wildland Fire Sharing
Circle. Miami University hosted and facilitated the Sharing Circle. See

The term 'wildland fire' includes fires that are intentionally ignited
by ecological professionals, while the term 'wildfire' only encompasses
fires that are unintentional. The United States National Park Service
defines wildfire and wildland fire by the following: A wildfire is an
unplanned fire caused by lightning or other natural causes, by
accidental (or arson-caused) human ignitions, or by an escaped
prescribed fire that is intentionally ignited by park managers to meet
management objectives. Wildland fire is an overarching term describing
any non-structure fire that occurs in vegetation and natural fuels.
Wildland fire encompasses both prescribed fire and wildfire. Setting the
scene: [Why address wildland fires in the Arctic?]{.underline} Edward
Alexander lit a fire at his home in Fairbanks, Alaska that burned
throughout the entire Sharing Circle, linking the significance of fire
to the Gwich'in Nation and the work to be done in the Sharing Circle and
beyond. [Wildfires are associated with devastating loss,]{.underline}
but Arctic communities have lived with fire for millennia. [By bringing
Indigenous Knowledge into the conversation, fire can be
considered]{.underline} as [a tool for biodiversity and addressing
climate change. "We've been working to share]{.underline} our
[Indigenous practices]{.underline} -- our Gwich'in practices around
wildland fire -- [that go beyond suppression towards renewal, to
stimulating biodiversity]{.underline} [and]{.underline} perhaps even
[combating]{.underline} [climate change as a carbon negative
process."]{.underline} - Edward Alexander For example,
[Gwich'in]{.underline} [burn grass in early springtime]{.underline}
[when there is still snow]{.underline} in the timberline. [Due to the
low]{.underline} amount of [carbohydrates]{.underline} in the soil
[during that time]{.underline} [the burning is
carbon-neutral]{.underline} [and fertilizes the soil]{.underline} [for
increased biodiversity]{.underline} of plant and animal species in the
area. [Bringing Indigenous Knowledge]{.underline} [into]{.underline}
wildland [fire management will be key in addressing this
issue]{.underline}, [especially]{.underline} [as climate change impacts
wildfires]{.underline}. Just some of [these impacts include longer and
more intense fire]{.underline} [seasons]{.underline}, a [greater number
of fires]{.underline} [and]{.underline} hidden peat or "[zombie"
fires]{.underline}. And it is not only climate change impacting
wildfires, but also [wildfires]{.underline} [fueli]{.underline}ng [a
climate feedback loop due to]{.underline} the [release of greenhouse
gases.]{.underline} What causes wildfires? Many Arctic wildfires are
caused by lightning strikes. As the Arctic warms, lightning activity
increases, also increasing the likelihood of Arctic wildfires. Wildfires
are also caused by human activity. [The Arctic is warming]{.underline}
[at more than 3 times the rate of the rest of the world]{.underline},
making it possible for human activities such as industry and agriculture
to move further north. [Once a wildfire]{.underline} in the Arctic
[starts]{.underline}, [climate change]{.underline} can [create
conditions for especially intense fires]{.underline} on dry peatland and
forests. "[Wildland fire has gone from being an effect of a global
climate change to a driver of it.]{.underline} [It intersects with
human, environmental, and animal health."]{.underline} - Edward
Alexander Some of the [effects]{.underline} of wildland fires [include
degraded air quality]{.underline}, which can damage human health. Fires
threaten life, property and can have a significant impact on mental
health. Further, [ecosystems and local food]{.underline} [sources are
altered.]{.underline} To demonstrate the impact of wildfires, Mikhail
Pogodaev, Special Envoy on Indigenous Peoples and Regional Cooperation
for the Russian Chairmanship of the Arctic Council (2021-2023), shared
insights from the Sakha Republic (Yakutia). He noted that over the last
two years, the [extreme wildfire seasons]{.underline}
[exceeded]{.underline} [traditional]{.underline} [Indigenous Knowledge
of the 40-year time span between severe fires,]{.underline} [as well as
the average annual number of wildfires]{.underline}. [He also
highlighted the impact to Indigenous Peoples' livelihoods]{.underline},
[including]{.underline} among other things, [the loss of pastures to
wildfires and]{.underline} the associated [economic impacts as well
as]{.underline} the significant [impairment of air quality.]{.underline}

#### Climate change is driving early snow melt, resulting in earlier fires

fire season could follow\", January 23, 2025, No Publication,

[An early exit of Alaska's spring snow means more acreage could burn
during the coming wildfire season,]{.underline} which begins when the
snow melts off, says [new research from the University of Alaska
Fairbanks]{.underline} "The most significant finding is that **[during
many of the largest, most extreme fire seasons, we had early
snowoff]{.underline}**," explained [Peter Bieniek, lead author of
the study and a climate modeler at the UAF International Arctic Research
Center.]{.underline} "**[During these years there are large-scale
climate patterns that persist through time. They set up and keep a high
pressure over Alaska]{.underline}**." High pressure systems bring clear,
sunny and warm weather. There isn't a lot of rain, but in some cases
there are thunderstorms. When these conditions last for months, they can
lead to big fire seasons.  [Three of Alaska's four largest wildfire
seasons occurred during years with earlier than average snowoff dates.
Many Alaskans will remember these seasons. In 2004, 6 million acres
burned, and another 4.4 million acres burned the next year. In 2015, 5.1
million acres burned. Years with early snowoff were also responsible for
more than half of the historical area burned in Alaska]{.underline}. But
co-author Mitch Burgard reminded Alaskans that ["just because the snow
melted early, it's too early to panic that we're gonna have the biggest
fire season we've ever seen." "It's way too early for
that,"]{.underline} Burgard said. "The odds of it are slightly higher,
but a lot can happen between snowmelt and the end of the fire season."
Burgard is a fire analyst with the UAF Alaska Fire Science Consortium
who was a wildfire manager for 33 years and fought over 500 wildfires.
He helped frame the research to make it relevant and useful for Alaska
wildfire managers. He emphasized that if he were an Alaska wildfire
manager, "I would look at tracking the snowoff date and being prepared
on those earlier snowoff seasons."  For the general public, Burgard
said, there is a message too: "When the snow comes off your yard, that's
not too early to start thinking about fire. So taking your firewood off
of the porch and doing a little bit of cleanup and fuel reduction around
your home." Early snowoff accelerates the onset of an early fire season,
the study noted. [As snow melts, the darker ground absorbs more heat and
warms the local area, making the recently exposed fuels more susceptible
to burning.  In the Lower 48 states, spring often brings rains that
delay the fire season. That's not the case in Alaska]{.underline}.
Bieniek's research confirms what **[many wildfire managers already know
--- when the snow melts, it's fire season]{.underline}**. Snow melts in
Interior Alaska during May 2022. Photo by Heather McFarland Bieniek also
found **[that snow is melting earlier than in the past, due to climate
change]{.underline}**. In Southcentral Alaska[, average snowoff has come
over four days earlier each decade since 1959. Even on the North Slope,
where the trend was less extreme, snow now melts off two days earlier
each decade]{.underline}. These trends are expected to continue into the
future.    "For long-term fire planning, knowing that statistic is super
valuable," emphasized Burgard.  Burgard and Bieniek's partnership
represents an important and unique relationship between scientists and
wildfire managers in Alaska, one that is facilitated by the Alaska Fire
Science Consortium where Burgard works. These groups meet and
communicate so that wildfire research focuses on the pressing needs of
managers facing an era of longer, more severe fire seasons.  "We've got
a good relationship with wildfire managers," said Bieniek. "I think it's
probably one of the best collaborations that I've seen. I've even heard
folks say that they wish that this existed outside of Alaska. Just how
friendly and well integrated things are." The study is part of a larger
effort to improve seasonal weather and climate forecasts so that
managers can better prepare for the coming wildfire season. The topic
was listed as a research need by the Alaska Wildland Fire Coordinating
Group --- the state, federal and Native land management agencies/owners
that are responsible for fire management.  Other co-authors on the study
include Chris Waigl, Uma Bhatt, Tom Ballinger, Rick Lader, Cecilia
Borries-Strigle, Joshua Hostler, Elizabeth Fischer, Eric Stevens and
Heidi Strader. The research was supported by the National Science
Foundation's Alaska Established Program to Stimulate Competitive
Research. 

#### The federal governments decision to shift wildfire policy from suppression to a "let it burn" doctrine has been disastrous

[In Alaska, federal policy called for suppression of wildfires from
about 1940 to the mid-eighties. Alaska tried to suppress fires, but it
quickly became apparent that you can't get them all -- total fire
suppression doesn't work]{.underline}. Recognizing that fire is a
natural part of forest ecosystems, what they did was divide the state of
Alaska into four different initial attack options: Critical, Full,
Modified, and Limited depending on risk to values[. Initial attack is
when action is taken to control a fire within around 72 hours after
ignition; this time frame has the best chance for successful
suppression. Critical areas occur around communities and villages where
life and property are at ri]{.underline}sk. Full suppression areas tend
to be adjacent to communities or areas with human and cultural value
around them, and it's not quite as critical to get the fire out quickly,
but you still get there as soon as possible[. In Limited management
areas, fires are allowed to play their ecological role, but they are
monitored and specific sites will be protected as needed but there is
generally not an attempt for more widespread control of the
fire]{.underline}. Most of the state is in Limited management. Modified
management is treated like Full suppression early in the season until
around mid-July in interior Alaska, when it's treated as Limited because
there's less chance of a fire getting really big after that time period.
As fire occurrence increases, some land managers are rethinking this
fire management approach for their area. **[While fire is a natural part
of the ecosystem in Alaska, at what point might fire be
detrimental?]{.underline}** One example is a pilot project that was
instigated in 2023. The refuge manager of the Yukon Flats National
Wildlife Refuge in northeast Alaska changed the fire management option
on some areas of the refuge due to human health and carbon sequestration
concerns. There are quite a few villages within that area where people
are exposed to a lot of smoke, and it's a remote region with no roads so
they can't easily escape poor air quality. But we're also looking at it
from a climate change standpoint. [The smoke and greenhouse gas
emissions from the fires themselves can be massive. But in this area, we
also have a lot of Yedoma permafrost -- around 4 million acres - which
stores very old organic matter from the Pleistocene epoch and it's also
ice rich, meaning it\'s more susceptible to rapid thaw.]{.underline} So,
looking at these different factors, we changed some of the Yedoma areas
from the Limited to the Modified management option to protect
permafrost. This region is about 1.6 million acres, so it's a very large
area. **[Implementing fire suppression as a climate solution is a novel
concept for our modern fire management. Before, fire in this region
would only be suppressed if it posed a threat to humans or
property]{.underline}**. There were stipulations involved in enacting
this change. First is recognizing that life and property are always
going to come first for fire protection. Also, we don\'t want to send
firefighters to really remote locations where it would be hard to
extract them if they were injured, so these areas were excluded. We only
looked at areas that hadn\'t burned since about 1989, so fairly mature
forests with a thick organic mat. Another stipulation is that only fires
ignited in the Yedoma would be initial attacks; fires moving into the
area would not be suppressed. This is still an experiment now -- we\'re
looking to see how it works. We have limited resources, and it's
expensive to respond to remote fires. But if you look at the emissions
saved, the expense may not be so different from climate measures being
taken in other places. Ultimately, people are thinking about boreal fire
management differently. The idea is that this wouldn\'t be a permanent
change, but that it will play a role in reducing carbon emissions and
essentially buys us time while we aim to reach our climate goals.

#### Wildfire smoke devastates crop yields

Smoke from Wildfires Affecting Crop Yields?\", August 29, 2023, Pioneer,

The increase in wildfire activity has led to a substantial increase in
the number of days each year impacted by smoke in the air. [Effects of
wildfire smoke extend]{.underline} far [beyond the immediate vicinity of
the fires]{.underline}, with increases observed throughout the U.S.
(Burke et al., 2021). The [heat generated]{.underline} by active [fires
lifts smoke high into the atmosphere]{.underline}. At high altitudes,
the [smoke can travel with jet stream winds across the
continent]{.underline} (NASA, 2017). Pockets of concentrated smoke can
sometimes occur far from the fires that generated it (Figure 5). Smoke
is most noticeable and poses the greatest human health threat when it
descends to the surface; however, smoke at any altitude has [the
potential to affect crop growth by reflecting and scattering incoming
sunlight.]{.underline}

Photo - smoke concentration from wildfires.

fires in the Western U.S. and Canada, July 21, 2021. Source: NASA Earth
Observatory.

Given what is known about the factors that have led to increased
wildfire activity, it's a virtual certainty that wildfire smoke in the
atmosphere will continue to increase in frequency and concentration for
the foreseeable future, making it important to understand how crop
growth and productivity might be affected.

Effects on Sunlight

The greatest potential impact of wildfire smoke on crop growth comes
through the effects that it can have on sunlight that reaches the crop;
specifically, its ability to reduce sunlight intensity and increase
sunlight diffusion (Figure 6).

Reduced Sunlight Intensity

[The most obvious effect of wildfire smoke in the atmosphere is a
reduction in total solar radiation]{.underline}. Much like a hazy cloud
cover, smoke reflects a portion of incoming sunlight, reducing the
amount of light available to plants. [Since plants depend on sunlight to
carry out photosynthesis, any reduction in light is potentially
detrimental to crop productivity. Plants with]{.underline} the [C4
carbon fixation pathway, such as corn, have a higher light saturation
point, making them more susceptible]{.underline} [to reductions in solar
radiation]{.underline} than C3 plants such as soybeans.

Increased Diffusion of Sunlight

In addition to reflecting a portion of incoming light,
[smoke]{.underline} also [scatters]{.underline} it, making the
[light]{.underline} available to plants more diffuse. Wildfire smoke
[can significantly increase the diffuse fraction of photosynthetically
active radiation (PAR)]{.underline}, which can benefit plants by
increasing their light use efficiency. The potential effect of more
diffuse light on plant growth depends on the characteristics of the
plant canopy, with taller, higher leaf area index, and multilayer
canopies likely to benefit more from diffuse radiation than shorter
plants.

Figure 6. Smoky sunset in central Iowa. July 31, 2021.

Complex and Interacting Effects

Of the two primary effects of wildfire smoke on photosynthetically
active radiation, one of them -- reduced total solar radiation -- is
likely to be negative in most circumstances, while increased diffusion
of solar radiation could potentially be positive for crop growth. The
ultimate effect on crop growth and yield will depend on the relative
impact of these factors. For example, any benefit derived from increased
diffuse radiation could be negated if the reduction in total solar
radiation is too great.

Additional effects could come into play as well. Reduction in solar
radiation can reduce surface temperatures, which may be good, bad, or
neutral depending on the timing and circumstances. If a crop is
suffering through a period of drought stress, a temporary moderation of
daytime temperatures may be helpful. On the other hand, if a crop is
running behind in its development due to below-normal GDU accumulation,
further reductions in temperature from wildfire smoke will likely make
things worse.

Solar Radiation and Crop Production

Numerous experiments over the years have studied the impact of reduced
solar radiation on corn yields using shade cloths that cover a portion
of the crop canopy and reduce the intensity of incident solar radiation
by a certain amount. These studies have provided some important insights
on the effects of reduced solar radiation on corn.

Table 1. Percent corn yield reduction associated with three different
levels of shading (15%, 30%, and 50%) for two hybrids at three different
plant densities (Yang et al., 2019).

\* Not significant at α=0.05

**[Reductions in yield can be dramatic]{.underline}**. Studies that have
included [shade treatments that reduce light by 50% or more during grain
fill have seen corn **yield drop by more than half**]{.underline}
(Table 1) (Yang et al., 2019).

Effects of a 70 percent shade treatment applied at different timings on
corn pollination and ear length in a 2021 Pioneer Agronomy study.

Figure 7. Effects of a 70% shade treatment applied at different timings
on corn pollination and ear length in a 2021 Pioneer Agronomy study
(Emmert, 2021).

Timing and intensity matter. Studies that have included multiple degrees
of shading have found, not surprisingly, that the more solar radiation
is reduced, the greater the effect on yield. Yang et al. (2019) found
that impact on yield more than doubled when shading was increased from
30% to 50% (Table 1). The timing of shading is also of critical
importance in corn (Figure 7). Reductions in solar radiation during
silking and grain fill have a much greater impact than the same level of
reduction prior to silking (Table 2) (Liu and Tollenaar, 2009; Reed et
al., 1988).

Table 2. Effect of shade treatment timing on corn yield (Liu and
Tollenaar, 2009.)

NS=not significant, \*\*= highly significant, (α=0.05)

Effects can vary by hybrid and plant density. Yang et al. (2019)
compared effects of shading during grain fill on two different hybrids
at three different plant densities. When solar radiation was only
reduced by 15%, yield impacts were similar across plant densities. As
the degree of shading was increased, however; yield reductions were
greater at higher plant densities. The two hybrids compared in the study
also differed in their response to reduced light levels, with one hybrid
consistently affected more than the other. At the 15% level of shading,
yield of the more sensitive hybrid was reduced by 13-15% while the more
tolerant hybrid did not have a significant reduction in yield (Table 1).

[Reduced solar radiation can also affect stalk quality]{.underline}. In
addition to direct effects on corn yield, [reduced solar radiation can
reduce harvestable yield by negatively affecting stalk quality and
standability.]{.underline} Upon successful pollination, ear development
places a great demand on the plant for carbohydrates. When the demands
of the developing kernels exceed the supply produced by the leaves,
stalk and root storage reserves are utilized. [Environmental stresses
which decrease the amount of photosynthate produced by the plant can
force plants to extract even greater percentages of stalk
carbohydrates,]{.underline} which preserves grain fill rates at the
expense of stalk quality. As carbohydrates stored in the roots and stalk
are mobilized to the ear, these structures begin to decline and soon
lose their resistance to soil-borne pathogens. Instances of severe stalk
rots and lodging have often been observed in association with prolonged
periods of low solar radiation during grain fill.

How Much Does Wildfire Smoke Reduce Solar Radiation?

Shading [studies in corn]{.underline} have often involved treatments
[that reduced solar radiation by large percentages, similar to
reductions that would be caused by moderate to heavy cloud
cover]{.underline}. Data collected in Johnston, IA, [found that solar
radiation reductions from cloud cover ranged from 23 to 62%]{.underline}
(Figure 8). So how much does [wildfire smoke reduce solar
radiation?]{.underline}

Daily PAR received in Johnston IA under sunny cloudy and rainy
conditions on four different days during summer of 2015.

Figure 8. Daily PAR received in Johnston, IA under sunny, cloudy, and
rainy conditions on four different days during summer of 2015.

A study conducted in 2018 in the California Central Valley found that
total PAR was only reduced by 3.6% on average due to wildfire smoke,
while the diffuse fraction increased by over 34% during the study period
from mid-July to the end of August (Hemes et al., 2020). [The predicted
effect on corn was a 2.5% increase in photosynthesis]{.underline}, as
the positive effect of more diffuse PAR exceeded the negative effect of
reduced total PAR. However[, under the smokiest conditions observed
during the study period, photosynthesis was predicted to decline by over
8%.]{.underline} The authors of the study noted that it focused on
ecosystem productivity -- which is a measure of the rate of total
biomass generation in an ecosystem -- and not crop yield specifically,
and that yield may not respond to increased diffuse PAR in the same way.

Another study in California focused on lake ecosystems found that
wildfire smoke over a 55-day period in 2018 reduced PAR by 11% compared
to the 2014-2017 average (Scordo et al., 2021). Ohio State University
researchers compared photosynthetic photon flux density in June and July
of 2021, a period marked by frequent smoke in the atmosphere, with the
average of the previous 4 years and found that levels were reduced by
6-7% (Table 3).

Direct Effects of Smoke

[The Canadian wildfires of 2023 brought increased attention]{.underline}
to the direct impacts of ground-level smoke on living organisms (Londo
et al., 2023). The locations of the fires, combined with weather
conditions at the time, resulted in numerous major cities in the Eastern
and Midwestern U.S. being blanketed with a heavy cover of ground-level
smoke for several days. This raised questions about the impacts of smoke
on human health, as well as the health of living things more broadly.

What is in Wildfire Smoke?

Smoke produced from the burning of natural biomass is composed of a
complex mixture of gases and particulate matter, which includes both
solids and liquids. The largest component of smoke is water vapor. Other
constituents include carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen
oxides; however, thousands of different chemical compounds can be
contained in small amounts within the particulate and gaseous fractions
of wildfire smoke.

Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is the main cause of the visible haze of
smoke that reflects and scatters sunlight and is also the main concern
with regards to human health. The U.S. EPA categorizes airborne
particulate matter based on size:

PM10 = particles 10 micrometers or smaller

PM2.5 = particles 2.5 micrometers or smaller

For comparison, a human hair is typically 50-70 micrometers in diameter.
Particles under 2.5 micrometers are the most dangerous for human health
because they are small enough to penetrate deep into the lungs and enter
the bloodstream. Over 90% of the particle mass in wildfire smoke is
comprised of PM2.5.

Smoke Changes Over Time

[Compounds contained in wildfire smoke can undergo reactions in the
atmospher]{.underline}e, changing the composition of the smoke over time
and potentially making it more toxic (Gray, 2020). Hazardous air
pollutants (HAPs) such as benzene and formaldehyde can be produced by
these reactions. [One of the most important of these secondary products
is ozone.]{.underline}

Ozone

Ozone (O3) is most commonly known for the naturally occurring ozone
layer in the upper atmosphere that shields Earth from harmful
ultraviolet radiation. Ground-level ozone, however, is a damaging air
pollutant that is harmful both to human health and plant growth.

Ozone is formed when pollutants, mainly nitrogen oxides and volatile
organic compounds, react in the atmosphere in the presence of sunlight.
Wildfires emit large quantities of these precursor compounds. Nitrogen
oxides and organic carbons produced by wildfires can be transported long
distances by regional weather patterns before they react to create ozone
in the atmosphere, where it can persist for several weeks.

[Ground-level **ozone is very harmful to plants**, causing more damage
to plants than all other air pollutants combined]{.underline} (USDA ARS,
2016). Ozone is a strong oxidant and [damages plants by entering stomata
and oxidizing (burning) plant tissue during respiration.]{.underline}
**[Elevated ozone levels have the potential to significantly reduce crop
yields]{.underline}**. Dicot species such as soybean are generally
thought to be more susceptible to yield reduction than monocot species
such as corn (Heagle, 1989), although research has shown that corn and
soybean are both susceptible to yield loss from ozone pollution (McGrath
et al., 2015).

How Does Smoke Affect Ground Level Air Quality?

The air quality index (AQI) is the EPA's index for reporting air
quality. Pollutant levels are indexed on a scale ranging from 0 to 500
based on their impact on human health.

The smokiest day of 2023 at the Corteva Agriscience research farm at
Johnston, IA was June 28 (shown in Figure 1 and Figure 9).

The main pollutant associated with wildfire smoke is fine particulate
matter (PM2.5) Air quality monitoring showed a large spike in PM2.5 on
June 27 and 28.

Ground level ozone exceeded an AQI of 100 several times in June, with
concentrations well into the range known to reduce crop yields, but
there was no spike corresponding with the wildfire smoke, indicating
that other factors were primarily driving ozone levels.

Nitrogen dioxide levels never exceeded an AQI of 50.

Phytotoxic Effects of Pollutants

[Particulate matter, ozone, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide
(SO2) are all components of wildfire smoke that are known to be harmful
to plants]{.underline}. Furthermore, all four have been shown to reduce
yields in corn and soybeans. A 2021 study estimated that [the presence
of these pollutants in the atmosphere has reduced yields of corn and
soybean in the U.S. by roughly 5% over the past 20 years (Lobell and
Burney, 2021).]{.underline}

However, these pollutants can come from a variety of sources other than
wildfire smoke, such as industrial and automotive pollution, so the
question then becomes whether the additional contribution from wildfire
smoke is large enough to impact yield. Based on the available evidence,
it seems unlikely. Although these pollutants are proven to reduce crop
yield, exposure from sources such as industrial and automotive pollution
would be relatively constant over time for crops in affected areas,
whereas any additional contribution from wildfire smoke is likely to be
short-lived. Furthermore, smoke plumes higher up in the atmosphere may
not affect ground-level air quality at all.

Wildfire Smoke Effect On Crop Yields

Determining the actual impact of wildfire smoke on crop yields is
challenging for a number of reasons, including the multiple, competing
effects involved and the difficulty in isolating the effects of smoke
from other influences. Conducting controlled experiments on wildfire
smoke is impractical, so research has often focused on measuring the
effects of smoke events as they occur. Experiments such as shading
studies can provide important insights into the possible impact of
specific aspects of smoke cover on crop yield but cannot replicate the
full suite of effects.

Based on what is known about the effects of reduced solar radiation and
phytotoxic compounds on crops, it seems very plausible that wildfire
smoke could cause reductions in crop yields. The scope of possible
outcomes likely ranges from slightly beneficial to significantly
harmful. The study by Hemes et al. (2020) probably represents something
close to a best-case scenario where the benefit of increased diffuse PAR
exceeded the negative effects of slightly lower total PAR and elevated
ozone. The heavier the smoke, the more likely reduction in total PAR
will be the dominant factor.

In general, corn is likely to be more susceptible to the effects of
wildfire smoke than soybeans. Corn has a higher light saturation point
due to its C4 photosynthetic pathway, so is more likely to be impacted
by reductions in total PAR. Corn may also experience reduced
standability if lower solar radiation during grain fill forces plants to
remobilize more carbohydrates from the stalk. The risk of yield loss and
reduced stalk health is likely greater when smoke imposes an additional
stress upon a crop that is already experiencing the effect other
stresses, like disease or drought stress. Clearly identifying all
contributing stresses can be very difficult, much less being able to
precisely quantify the impact each of the those compounding factors may
have had on the crop.

Corn and soybean can both be harmed by elevated ozone levels; however,
both the production of ozone from wildfire smoke and the intake of ozone
through plant stomata can be influenced by a number of different
factors. Corn and soybean already experience wide scale reductions in
yield from ozone associated with other sources of air pollution (McGrath
et al., 2015), so the additional effect of ozone specifically associated
with wildfire smoke could be difficult to determine.

Johnston IA research station

Figure 9. The Johnston, IA research station is located within a
relatively large metropolitan area. Ground-level ozone levels in 2023
routinely reached levels known to harm crop yields but there was no
uptick in ozone on smoky days, indicating that the effect of wildfire
smoke was likely minor compared to other sources of air pollution in the
area.

Conclusion

Although there are a number of ways that wildfire smoke could impact
crop productivity, it seems unlikely that the smoky conditions
experienced over the past few years have had a significant impact on
yields in most areas. Reductions in solar radiation have been temporary
and relatively minor, analogous to a slight increase in the density of
cloud cover. Smoky conditions in 2023 were most intense earlier in the
growing season before grain fill and likely had little impact. Increases
in ground-level pollutants appear unlikely to be of sufficient intensity
and duration to harm crops beyond the impacts already being experienced
from other sources of air pollution.

Wildfire smoke is not a problem that's going away anytime soon. Based on
what we know about the contributing factors, wildfires in western North
America are likely to increase in frequency and intensity in the coming
years. The effects on wildfire smoke on both agricultural and natural
ecosystems will continue to be an active area of research.

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [faces many threats
to]{.underline} our [Nat]{.underline}ional [Sec]{.underline}urity. These
threats include continuing wars with extremist elements such as ISIS and
potential wars with rogue state North Korea or regional nuclear power
Iran. The heated economic and diplomatic competition with Russia and a
surging China could spiral out of control. [Concurrently, we face
threats to our future security posed by growing civil strife, famine,
and refugee and migration challenges which create incubators for
extremist and anti-American government factions. Our
response]{.underline} cannot be one dimensional but instead [must
be]{.underline} a [nuanced and comprehensive]{.underline} National
Security Strategy combining all elements of National Power [including a
Food Security Strategy]{.underline}. [An American Food Security Strategy
is an imperative factor in reducing the multiple threats impacting our
National wellbeing]{.underline}. Recent history has shown that [reliable
food supplies and stable prices produce more stable and secure
countries. Conversely, food insecurity, particularly in poorer
countries, can lead to instability, unrest, and violence]{.underline}.
Food insecurity drives mass migration around the world from the Middle
East, to Africa, to Southeast Asia[, destabilizing neighboring
populations, generating conflicts, and threatening our own security by
disrupting our economic, military, and diplomatic
relationship]{.underline}s. [Food system shocks from extreme food-price
volatility can be correlated with protests and riots.]{.underline} Food
price related protests toppled governments in Haiti and Madagascar in
2007 and 2008. In 2010 and in 2011, food prices and grievances related
to food policy were one of the major drivers of the Arab Spring
uprisings. Repeatedly, history has taught us that a strong agricultural
sector is an unquestionable requirement for inclusive and sustainable
growth, broad-based development progress, and long-term stability. The
impact can be remarkable and far reaching. [Rising income, in addition
to reducing the opportunities for an upsurge in extremism, leads to
changes in diet, producing demand for more diverse and nutritious foods
provided, in many cases, from American farmers and
ranchers]{.underline}. Emerging markets currently purchase 20 percent of
U.S. agriculture exports and that figure is expected to grow as
populations boom. Moving early to ensure stability in strategically
significant regions requires long term planning and a disciplined,
thoughtful strategy. [To combat current threats and work to prevent
future ones, our national leadership must employ the entire spectrum of
our power including diplomatic, economic, and cultural elements. The
best means to prevent future chaos and the resulting instability is
positive engagement addressing the causes of instability before it
occurs]{.underline}. This is not rocket science. We know where the
instability is most likely to occur. The world population will grow by
2.5 billion people by 2050. Unfortunately, this massive population boom
is projected to occur primarily in the most fragile and food insecure
countries. This alarming math is not just about total numbers.
Projections show that the greatest increase is in the age groups most
vulnerable to extremism. There are currently 200 million people in
Africa between the ages of 15 and 24, with that number expected to
double in the next 30 years. Already, 60% of the unemployed in Africa
are young people. Too often these situations deteriorate into shooting
wars requiring the deployment of our military forces. We should be
continually mindful that the price we pay for committing military forces
is measured in our most precious national resource, the blood of those
who serve. For those who live in rural America, this has a
disproportionate impact. Fully 40% of those who serve in our military
come from the farms, ranches, and non-urban communities that make up
only 16% of our population. Actions taken now to increase agricultural
sector jobs can provide economic opportunity and stability for those
unemployed youths while helping to feed people. A recent report by the
Chicago Council on Global Affairs identifies agriculture development as
the core essential for providing greater food security, economic growth,
and population well-being. **[Our active support for food security,
including agriculture development, has helped stabilize key regions over
the past 60 years.]{.underline}** [A robust food security strategy, as a
part of our overall security strategy, can mitigate the growth of
terrorism, build important relationships, and support continued American
economic and agricultural prosperity while materially contributing to
our Nation's and the world's security.]{.underline}

emphasised by the US Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, in a
briefing to the US Senate in early 2019. 'Global environmental and
ecological degradation, as well as climate change, are likely to
fuel [competition for]{.underline} [resources]{.underline}, economic
distress, and social discontent through 2019 and beyond', he said.
'Climate hazards such as extreme weather, higher temperatures, droughts,
floods, wildfires, storms, sea level rise, soil degradation, and
acidifying
oceans [are]{.underline} [intensifying]{.underline}, [threatening]{.underline} infrastructure,
health, and water and [food security]{.underline}. Irreversible damage
to ecosystems and habitats will undermine the economic benefits they
provide, worsened by air, soil, water, and marine pollution.' Boldly,
Coats delivered his warning at a time when the US President, Trump, was
attempting to expunge all reference to climate from government
documents.23

conflict]{.underline} towards the mid twenty-first century.

[Food
wars]{.underline} often [start]{.underline} [out]{.underline} [small]{.underline},
as mere quarrels over grazing rights, access to wells or as one faction
trying to control food supplies and markets. However, if not resolved

conflagrations]{.underline} [which]{.underline}, if not quelled, can in

of]{.underline} [major powers]{.underline} -- [which]{.underline} in
turn [carries the]{.underline} [risk of transnational war]{.underline}.
The [danger]{.underline} is [magnified
by]{.underline} [swollen]{.underline} [populations]{.underline}, the
effects of climate change, depletion of key resources such as water,
topsoil and nutrients, the collapse of ecosystem services that support

poor, and]{.underline} the [rise
of]{.underline} [vast]{.underline} [megacities]{.underline} [unable to
feed themselves]{.underline} (Figure 5.3).

Each of the world's food 'powderkeg regions' is described below, in
ascending order of risk.

United States

In one sense, food wars have already broken out in the United States,
the most overfed country on Earth. Here the issue is chiefly the growing
depletion of the nation's mighty groundwater resources, especially in
states using it for food production, and the contest over what remains
between competing users -- farmers, ranchers and Native Americans on the
one hand and the oil, gas and mining industry on the other. Concern
about the future of US water supplies was aggravated by a series of
savage droughts in the early twentyfirst century in the west, south and
mid-west linked to global climate change and declining snowpack in the
Rocky Mountains, both of which affect not only agriculture but also the
rate at which the nation's groundwater reserves recharge.

'Groundwater depletion has been a concern in the Southwest and High
Plains for many years, but increased demands on our groundwater
resources have overstressed aquifers in many areas of the Nation, not
just in arid regions', notes the US Geological Survey.24

Nine US states depend on groundwater for between 50 per cent and 80 per
cent of their total freshwater supplies, and five states account for
nearly half of the nation's groundwater use. Major US water resources,
such as the High Plains aquifers and the Pacific Northwest aquifers have
sunk by 30--50 metres (100--150 feet) since exploitation began,
imperilling the agricultural industries that rely on them. In the arid
southwest, aquifer declines of 100--150 metres have been recorded
(Figure 5.4).

\[Figure omitted\]

To take but one case, the famed Ogallala Aquifer in the High Plains
region supports cropping industries worth more than US \$20 billion a
year and was in such a depleted state it would take more than 6000 years
to replace by natural infiltration the water drawn from it by farmers in
the past 150 years. As it dwindles, some farmers have tried to kick
their dependence on groundwater -- other users, including the growing
cities and towns of the region, proceeded to mine it as if there was no
tomorrow.25 A study by Kansas State University concluded that so far, 30
per cent of the local groundwater had been extracted and another 39 per
cent would be depleted by the mid century on existing trends in
withdrawal and recharge.26

Over half the US population relies on groundwater for drinking; both
rural and urban America are at risk. Cities such as New Orleans, Houston
and Miami face not only rising sea levels -- but also sinking land, due
to the extraction of underlying groundwater. In Memphis, Tennessee, the
aquifer that supplies the city's drinking water has dropped by 20
metres.

Growing [awareness of the]{.underline} [risk]{.underline} of a nation,
even one as large and technologically adept as the
USA, [having]{.underline} [insufficient]{.underline} water to grow
its [food]{.underline}, [generate
its]{.underline} [exports]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [supply]{.underline} its
urban homes [has fuelled tensions leading to the]{.underline} [eruption
of nationwide protests]{.underline} over 'fracking' for oil and gas -- a
process that can deplete or poison groundwater -- and the building of
oil pipelines, which have a habit of rupturing and also polluting water
resources. The boom in fracking and piping is part of a deliberate US
policy to become more self-reliant in fossil fuels.27 Thus, in its
anxiety to be independent of overseas energy suppliers, the USA in
effect decided to barter away its future food security for current oil
security -- and the price of this has been a lot of angry farmers,
Native Americans and concerned citizens.

The depletion of US groundwater coincides with accelerating climate
risk, which may raise US temperatures by as much as 4--5 C by 2100,
leading to major losses in soil moisture throughout the US grain belt,
and the spread of deserts in the south and west. Food production will
also be affected by fiercer storms, bigger floods, more heatwaves, an
increase in drought frequency and greater impacts from crop and
livestock diseases. In such a context, it is no time to be wasting
stored water.

The case of the USA is included in the list of world 'hot spots' for
future food conflict, not because there is danger of a serious shooting
war erupting over water in America in the foreseeable future, but to
illustrate that [even]{.underline} in [technologically
advanced]{.underline} [countries]{.underline} [unforeseen]{.underline} [social
tensions and crises are]{.underline} [on the
rise]{.underline} [over]{.underline} basic resources
like [food]{.underline}, land and water and their depletion. This
doesn't just happen in Africa or the Middle East. [It's
a]{.underline} [global phenomenon]{.underline}.

Furthermore, the [USA is the]{.underline} world's [largest food
exporter]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [any]{.underline} [retreat]{.underline} on
its
part [will]{.underline} [have]{.underline} [a]{.underline} [disproportionate]{.underline} [effect
on world food]{.underline} [price]{.underline} [and
supply]{.underline}. [There is still plenty of time
to]{.underline} [replan]{.underline} America's [food
systems]{.underline} and water usage -- [but]{.underline}, as in the
case of fossil fuels and climate, rear-guard [action mounted
by]{.underline} [corporate]{.underline} vested [interests]{.underline} and
their hired politicians [may well]{.underline} \[[freeze]{.underline}\]
paralyse the [national will to do it]{.underline}. That is when the [US
food system could find itself at]{.underline} [serious
risk]{.underline}, losing access to water in a time of growing climatic
disruption, caused by exactly the same forces as those depleting the
groundwater: the fossil fuels sector and its political stooges. The
probable [effect]{.underline} of this [will]{.underline}, in the first
instance, [be
a]{.underline} [decline]{.underline} [in]{.underline} [US]{.underline} meat
and dairy [production]{.underline} accompanied by rising prices and a
fall in its feedgrain exports, [with]{.underline} [domino
effects]{.underline} on livestock industries [worldwide]{.underline}.

The flip-side to this issue is that America's old rival, Russia, is
likely to gain in both farmland and water availability as the planet
warms through the twentyfirst century -- and likewise Canada. Both these
countries stand to prosper from a US withdrawal from world food markets,
and together they may negate the effects of any US food export
shortfalls.

Central and South America

South America is one of the world's most bountiful continents in terms
of food production -- but, after decades of improvement, malnutrition is
once more on the rise, reaching a new peak of 42.5 million people
affected in 2016.28 'Latin America and the Caribbean used to be a
worldwide example in the fight against hunger. We are now following the
worrisome global trend', said regional FAO representative Julio
Berdegué.29

Paradoxically, obesity is increasing among Latin American adults, while
malnutrition is rising among children. 'Although Latin America and the
Caribbean produce enough food to meet the needs of their population,
this does not ensure healthy and nutritious diets', the FAO explains.
Worsening income inequality, poor access to food and persistent poverty
are contributing to the rise in hunger and bad diets, it adds.30

'The impact of climate change in Latin America and the Caribbean will be
considerable because of its economic dependence on agriculture, the low
adaptive capacity of its population and the geographical location of
some of its countries', an FAO report warned.31

Emerging food insecurity in Central and Latin America is being driven by
a toxic mixture of failing water supplies, drying farmlands, poverty,
maladministration, incompetence and corruption. These issues are
exacerbated by climate change, which is making the water supply issue
worse for farmers and city people alike in several countries and
delivering more weather disasters to agriculture.

Mexico has for centuries faced periodic food scarcity, with a tenth of
its people today suffering under-nutrition. In 2008 this rose to 18 per
cent, leading to outbreaks of political violence.32 In 2013, 52 million
Mexicans were suffering poverty and seven million more faced extreme
hunger, despite the attempts of successive governments to remedy the
situation. By 2100 northern Mexico is expected to warm by 4--5 C and
southern Mexico by 1.5--2.5 C. Large parts of the country, including
Mexico City, face critical water scarcity. Mexico's cropped area could
fall by 40--70 per cent by the 2030s and disappear completely by the end
of the century, making it one of the world's countries most at risk from
catastrophic climate change and a major potential source of climate
refugees.33

The vanishing lakes and glaciers of the high Andes confront montane
nations -- Bolivia, Peru and Chile especially -- with the spectre of
growing water scarcity and declining food security. The volume of many
glaciers, which provide meltwater to the region's rivers, which in turn
irrigate farmland, has halved since 1975.34 Bolivia's second largest
water body, the 2000 square kilometres Lake Poopo, dried out
completely.35 The loss of water is attributed partly to El Niño
droughts, partly to global warming and partly to over-extraction by the
mining industries of the region. Chile, with 24,000 glaciers (80 per
cent of all those in Latin America) is feeling the effects of their
retreat and shrinkage especially, both in large cities such as the
capital Santiago, and in irrigation agriculture and energy supply. Chile
is rated by the World Resources Institute among the countries most
likely to experience extreme water stress by 2040.36

Climate change is producing growing water and food insecurity in the
'dry corridor' of Central America, in countries such as El Salvador,
Guatemala and Honduras. Here a combination of drought, major floods and
soil erosion is undermining efforts to raise food production and
stabilise nutrition.

Food production in Venezuela began falling in the 1990s, and by the late
2010s two thirds of the population were malnourished; there was a
growing flood of refugees into Colombia and other neighbouring
countries. The food crisis has been variously blamed on the Venezuelan
government's 'Great Leap Forward' (modelled on that of China -- which
also caused widespread starvation), a halving in Venezuela's oil export
earnings, economic sanctions by the USA, and corruption. However, local
scientists such as Nobel Laureate Professor Juan Carlos Sánchez warn
that climate impacts are already striking the densely populated coastal
regions with increased torrential rains, flooding and mudslides,
droughts and hurricanes, while inland areas are drying out and
desertifying, leading to crop failures, water scarcity and a tide of
climate refugees.37 These factors will tend to deepen food insecurity
towards the mid century. Venezuela's climate refugees are already making
life more difficult for neighbouring countries such as Colombia.

Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has, in recent decades, removed
around 20 per cent of its total tree cover, replacing it with dry
savannah and farmland. At 40 per cent clearance and with continued
global warming, scientists anticipate profound changes in the local
climate, towards a drying trend, which will hammer the agriculture that
has replaced the forest.38 Brazil has already wiped out the oncevast
Mata Atlantica forest along its eastern coastline, and this region is
now drying, with resultant water stress for both farming and major
cities like São Paulo. Brazil's outlook for 2100 is for further drying
-- tied to forest loss as well as global climate change -- increased
frequency of drought and heatwaves, major fires and acute water scarcity
in some regions. Moreover, as the Amazon basin dries out, it will
release vast quantities of CO2 from its peat swamps and rainforest
soils. These are thought to contain in excess of three billion tonnes of
carbon and could cause a significant acceleration in global warming,
affecting everyone on Earth.39

[Latin America]{.underline} [is
the]{.underline} world [capital]{.underline} [of]{.underline} [private
armies]{.underline}, with [as many as 50]{.underline} [major guerrilla
groups]{.underline}, [paramilitaries]{.underline}, [terrorist]{.underline}, [indigenous]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [criminal]{.underline} [insurgencies]{.underline} over
the past half century -- [exemplified in]{.underline} familiar [names
like]{.underline} the [Sandanistas]{.underline} (Nicaragua), [FARC]{.underline} (Colombia) [and]{.underline} [Shining
Path]{.underline} (Peru).40 Many of these drew their initial inspiration
from the international communist movement of the mid twentieth century,
while others are right-wing groups set up in opposition to them or else
represent land rights movements of disadvantaged groups.
However, [all]{.underline} these [movements]{.underline} [rely]{.underline} [for]{.underline} [oxygen]{.underline} [on]{.underline} [simmering]{.underline} [public
discontent]{.underline} [with]{.underline} [ineffectual]{.underline} [or]{.underline} [corrupt]{.underline} [governments
and lack of fair access to]{.underline} [food]{.underline}, land and
water generally. In other words, the [tendency of South and Central
America towards]{.underline} [internal armed
conflict]{.underline} [is]{.underline} [supercharged]{.underline} significantly [by
failings in the food system]{.underline} which generate public anger,
leading to sympathy and support for anyone seen to be challenging the
incumbent regimes. This is not to suggest that [feeding every
person]{.underline} well would end all insurgencies -- but
it [would]{.underline} certainly [take the]{.underline} [wind of popular
support]{.underline} [out of]{.underline} a lot of [their
sails]{.underline}. In that sense the revolutionary tendency of South
America echoes the preconditions for revolution in France and Russia in
the eighteenth and twentieth centuries.

Central Asia

The [risk of wars breaking out over]{.underline} water, energy and [food
insecurity]{.underline} [in Central Asia]{.underline} [is
high]{.underline}.41 Here, the five [main
players]{.underline} -- [Kazakhstan]{.underline}, [Uzbekistan]{.underline}, [Turkmenistan]{.underline}, [Tajikistan]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [Kyrgyzstan]{.underline} -- [face
swelling populations, crumbling]{.underline} Soviet-era [infrastructure,
flagging resource cooperation, a degrading landscape, deteriorating food
availability and a changing climate]{.underline}. At the heart of the
issue and the region's increasingly volatile politics is water: 'Without
water in the region's two great rivers -- the Syr Darya and the Amu
Darya -- vital crops in the downstream agricultural powerhouses would
die. Without power, life in the upstream countries would be unbearable
in the freezing winters', wrote Rustam Qobil.42

Central Asia's water crisis first exploded onto the global consciousness
with the drying of the Aral Sea -- the world's fourth largest lake --
from the mid 1960s43, following the damming and draining of major rivers
such as the Amu Darya, Syr Darya and Naryn. It was hastened by a major
drought in 200844 exacerbated by climate change, which is melting the
'water tower' of glacial ice stored in the Tien Shan, Pamir and Hindu
Kush mountain ranges that feed the region's rivers. The Tien Shan alone
holds 10,000 glaciers, all of them in retreat, losing an estimated 223
million cubic metres a year. At such a rate of loss the region's rivers
will run dry within a generation.45 Lack of water has already delivered
a body blow to Central Asia's efforts to modernise its agriculture,
adding further tension to regional disputes over food, land and water.

'Water has always been a major cause of wars and border conflicts in the
Central Asian region', policy analyst Fuad Shahbazov warned. This
potential for conflict over water has been exacerbated by disputes over
the Fergana valley, the region's greatest foodbowl, which underwent a 32
per cent surge in population in barely ten years -- while more and more
of it turned to desert.46

The Central Asian region is ranked by the World Resources Institute as
one of the world's most perilously water-stressed regions to 2040
(Figure 5.6). With their economies hitting rock
bottom, [corrupt]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [autocratic]{.underline} [governments]{.underline} that [prefer
to]{.underline} [blame others]{.underline} [for their problems and
growing quarrels over]{.underline} [food]{.underline}, land, energy and
water, [the]{.underline} ['Stans' face]{.underline} ['a perfect
storm']{.underline}, Nate Shenkkan wrote in the journal Foreign Policy.
47 [Increased meddling
by]{.underline} [Russia]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [China]{.underline} [is
augmenting the explosive mix]{.underline}: [China regards Central Asia
as a]{.underline} [key component]{.underline} [of
its]{.underline} '[B]{.underline}elt
and [R]{.underline}oad' [i]{.underline}nitiative intended to expand its
global influence, [whereas Russia hopes to]{.underline} [lure the
region]{.underline} [back into its]{.underline} own [economic
sphere]{.underline}. Their [rival investments]{.underline} may help
limit some of the problems faced by Central Asia -- or they may [unlock
a]{.underline} [fresh
cycle]{.underline} [of]{.underline} political [feuding]{.underline}, [turmoil]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [regime
change]{.underline}.48

A 2017 FAO report found 14.3 million people -- one in every five -- in
Central Asia did not have enough to eat and a million faced actual
starvation, children especially. It noted that after years of steady
improvement, the situation was deteriorating. This [combination
of]{.underline} [intractable]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [deteriorating]{.underline} [factors
makes Central Asia a]{.underline} [serious]{.underline} internal [war
risk]{.underline} towards the mid twentyfirst
century, [with]{.underline} [involvement by
superpowers]{.underline} [raising the danger of international
conflict]{.underline} and mass refugee flight.

The Middle East

The Middle East is the most water-stressed region on Earth (see Figure
5.5 above). It is 'particularly vulnerable to climate change. It is one
of the world's most water-scarce and dry regions, with a high dependency
on climate-sensitive agriculture and a large share of its population and
economic activity in flood-prone urban coastal zones', according to the
World Bank.49

The Middle East -- consisting of the 22 countries of the Arab League,
Turkey and Iran -- has very low levels of natural rainfall to begin
with. Most of it has 600 millimetres or less per year and is classed as
arid. 'The Middle East and North Africa \[[MENA]{.underline}\] [is
a]{.underline} [global]{.underline} [hotspot]{.underline} of
unsustainable water use, especially of groundwater. In some countries,
more than half of current water withdrawals exceed what is naturally
available', the Bank said in a separate report on water scarcity.50

\[Figure omitted\]

'The climate is predicted to become even hotter and drier in most of the
MENA region. Higher temperatures and reduced precipitation will increase
the occurrence of droughts. It is further estimated that an additional
80--100 million people will be exposed by 2025 to water stress', the
Bank added.

The region's population of 300 million in the late 2010s is forecast to
double to 600 million by 2050. Average temperatures are expected to rise
by 3--5 C and rainfall will decrease by around 20 per cent. The result
will be vastly increased water stress, accelerated desertification,
growing food insecurity and a rise in sea levels displacing tens of
millions from densely populated, low-lying areas like the Nile delta.51
The region is deemed highly vulnerable to climate impacts, warns a
report by the UN Development Programme. 'Current climate change
projections show that by the year 2025, the water supply in the Arab
region will be only 15 per cent of levels in 1960. With population
growth around 3 per cent annually and deforestation spiking to 4 per
cent annually\... the region now includes 14 of the world's 20 most
water-stressed countries.' 52

The Middle East/North Africa (MENA) region has 6 per cent of the world's
population with only 1.5 per cent of the world's fresh water reserves to
share among them. This means that the average citizen already has about
a third less water than the minimum necessary for a reasonable existence
-- many have less than half, and populations are growing
rapidly. [Coupled]{.underline} [with]{.underline} [political
chaos]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [ill governance]{.underline} in

evident]{.underline} [cauldron for conflict]{.underline} in the

Growing [awareness of]{.underline} their [food
risk]{.underline} has [impelled]{.underline} some oil-rich [Arab states
into an]{.underline} [international farm buying spree]{.underline},
purchasing farming, fishing and food processing companies in countries
as assorted as South Sudan, Ethiopia, the Philippines, Ukraine, the USA,
Poland, Argentina, Australia, Brazil and Morocco. In some food-stressed
countries [these acquisitions]{.underline} have already [led
to]{.underline} [riots]{.underline} and killings.53 The [risk is high
that]{.underline}, by exporting its own food--land--water problems
worldwide, especially to regions already facing
scarcity, [the]{.underline} [Mid]{.underline}dle [East]{.underline} [could
propagate]{.underline} [conflicts]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [government
collapses]{.underline} [around the]{.underline} [globe]{.underline}.
This is despite the fact that high-tech solar desalination, green
energy, hydroponics, aquaponics and other intensive urban food
production technologies make it possible for the region to produce far
more of its own food locally, if not to be entirely self-sufficient.

Dimensions of the growing crisis in the Middle East include the
following.

Wars have already broken out in Syria and Yemen in which scarcity of
food, land and water were prominent among the tensions that led to
conflict between competing groups.

Food, land and water issues feed into and exacerbate already volatile
sentiment over religion, politics, corruption, mismanagement and foreign
interference by the USA, China and Russia.

The introduction of cheap solar-powered and diesel pumps has accelerated
the unsustainable extraction of groundwater throughout the region,
notably in countries like Libya, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Morocco.54

Turkish building of new dams to monopolise waters flowing across its
borders is igniting scarcity and potential for conflict with downstream
nations, including Iraq, Iran and Syria.55

Egypt's lifeline, the Nile, is threatened by Ethiopian plans to dam the
Blue Nile, with tensions that some observers consider could lead to a
shooting war.56

There are very low levels of water recycling throughout the region,
while water use productivity is about half that of the world as a whole.

There is a lack of a sense of citizen responsibility for water and food
scarcity throughout the region.

Land grabs around the world by oil-rich states are threatening to
destabilise food, land and water in other countries and regions, causing
conflict.

A decline in oil prices and the displacement of oil by the global
renewables revolution may leave the region with fewer economic options
for solving its problems.

China

China is the world's biggest producer, importer and consumer of food.
Much of the landmass of the People's Republic of China (PRC) is too
mountainous or too arid for farming, but the rich soils of its eastern
and southern regions are highly productive provided sufficient water is
available and climate impacts are mild. Those, however, are very big
'ifs'.

In 1995, American environmentalist Lester R. Brown both irked and
aroused the PRC Communist Party bosses with a small, hard-hitting book
entitled Who Will Feed China? Wake-Up Call for a Small Planet. 57 In it
he posited that Chinese population growth was so far out of control that
the then-agricultural system could not keep up, and China would be
forced to import vast amounts of grain, to the detriment of food prices
and availability worldwide. His fears, so far, have not been realised --
not because they were unsoundly based, but because China managed -- just
-- to stay abreast of rising food demand by stabilising and subsidising
grain prices, restoring degraded lands, boosting agricultural science
and technology, piping water from south to north, developing
high-intensity urban farms, buying up foreign farmland worldwide and
encouraging young Chinese to leave the country. What Brown didn't
anticipate was the economic miracle that made China rich enough to
afford all this. However, his essential thesis remains valid: [China's
food supply]{.underline} will [remain on
a]{.underline} [knife-edge]{.underline} for the entire twentyfirst
century, vulnerable especially to water scarcity and climate impacts. If
the nation outruns its domestic resources yet still has to eat, it may
well be at the expense of others globally.

Some western commentators were puzzled when China scrapped its 35-year
'One Child Policy' in 2015, but in fact the policy had done its job,
shaving around 300 million people off the projected peak of Chinese
population. It was also causing serious imbalances, such as China's huge
unmarried male surplus. Furthermore, rising urbanisation and household
incomes meant Chinese parents no longer wanted large families, as in the
past. Policy or no policy, China's birthrate has continued to fall and
by 2018 was 1.6 babies per woman -- well below replacement, lower than
the USA and nearly as low as Germany. Its population was 1.4 billion,
but this was growing at barely 0.4 per cent a year, with the growth due
at least in part to lengthening life expectancy.58

For China, female fertility is no longer the key issue. The critical
issue is water. And the critical region is the north, where 41 per cent
of the population reside. Here surface and groundwaters -- which support
not only the vast grain and vegetable farming industries of the North
China Plain but also burgeoning megacities like Beijing, Tianjin and
Shenyang -- have been vanishing at an alarming rate. 'In the past 25
years, 28,000 rivers have disappeared. Groundwater has fallen by up to
1--3 metres a year. One consequence: parts of Beijing are subsiding by
11 cm a year. The flow of the Yellow River, water supply to millions, is
a tenth of what it was in the 1940s; it often fails to reach the sea.
Pollution further curtails supply: in 2017 8.8 per cent of water was
unfit even for agricultural or industrial use', the Financial Times
reported.59 On the North China Plain, annual consumption of water for
all uses, including food production, is about 27 billion cubic metres a
year -- compared with an annual water availability of 22 billion cubic
metres, a deficit that is made up by the short-term expedient of mining
the region's groundwater.60

To stave off disaster, the PRC has built a prodigious network of canals
and pipelines from the Yangtse River in the water-rich south, to Beijing
in the water-starved north. Hailed as a 'lifeline', the South--North
Water Transfer Project had two drawbacks: first, the fossil energy
required to pump millions of tonnes of water over a thousand kilometres
and, second, the fact that while the volume was sufficient to satisfy
the burgeoning cities for a time, it could not supply and distribute
enough clean water to meet the needs of irrigated farming over so vast a
region in the long run, nor meet those of its planned industrial
growth.61 Oft-mouthed 'solutions' like desalination or the piping of
water from Tibet or Russia face similar drawbacks: demand is too great
for the potential supply and the costs, both financial and
environmental, prohibitive.

China is already among the world's most water-stressed nations. The
typical Chinese citizen has a 'water footprint' of 1071 cubic metres a
year -- three quarters of the world average (1385 cubic metres), and
scarcely a third that of the average American (2842 cubic metres).62 Of
this water, 62 per cent is used to grow food to feed the Chinese
population -- and 90 per cent is so polluted it is unfit to drink or use
in food processing. Despite massive investment in water infrastructure
and new technology, many experts doubt that China can keep pace with the
growth in its demand for food, at least within its own borders, chiefly
because of water scarcity.63 Adding to the pressure is that China's
national five-year plans for industrialisation demand massive amounts
more water -- demands that may confront China with a stark choice
between food and economic growth. 'The Chinese government is moving too
slowly towards the Camel Economy. It has plans, incentives for
officials; it invests in recycling, irrigation, pollution, drought
resistant crops; it leads the world in high voltage transmission (to get
hydro, wind and solar energy from the west of China). None of this is
sufficient or likely to be in time', the Financial Times opined.64

As the world's leading carbon emitter, China is more responsible for
climate change than any other country. It is also, potentially, more at
risk. The main reason, quite simply, is the impact of a warming world on
China's water supply -- in the form of disappearing rivers, lakes,
groundwater and mountain glaciers along with rising sea levels. To this
is coupled the threat to agriculture from increasing weather disasters
and the loss of ecosystem services from a damaged landscape.65

China is thus impaled on the horns of a classic dilemma. Without more
water it cannot grow its economy sufficiently to pay for the
water-conserving and food-producing technologies and infrastructure it
needs to feed its people. Having inadvertently unleashed a population
explosion with its highly successful conversion to modern farming
systems, the challenge for China now is to somehow sustain its food
supply through the population peak of the mid twentyfirst century,
followed by a managed decline to maybe half of today's numbers by the
early twentysecond century. It is far from clear whether the present
approach -- improving market efficiency, continuing to modernise
agricultural production systems, pumping water, trying to control soil
and water losses and importing more food from overseas -- will work.66

China has pinned its main hopes on technology to boost farm yields and
improve water distribution and management. Unfortunately, it has
selected the unsustainable American industrial farming model to do this
-- which involves the massive use of water, toxic chemicals,
fertilisers, fossil fuels and machines. This in turn is having dreadful
consequences for China's soils, waters, landscapes, food supply, air,
climate and consumer health. Serious questions are now being asked
whether such an approach is not digging the hole China is in, even
deeper. Furthermore, some western analysts are sceptical whether the
heavy hand of state control is up to the task of generating the levels
of innovation required to feed China sustainably.67

Plan B, which is to purchase food from other countries, or import it
from Chinese-owned farming and food ventures around the world, faces
similar difficulties. Many of the countries where China is investing in
food production themselves face a slow-burning crisis of land
degradation, water scarcity, surging populations and swelling local food
demand. By exporting its own problems, China is adding to their
difficulties. While there may be some truth to the claim that China is
helping to modernise food systems in Africa, for example, it is equally
clear that the export of food at a time of local shortages could have
dire consequences for Africans, leading to wars in Africa and elsewhere.
How countries will react to Chinese pressure to export food in the face
of their own domestic shortages is, as yet, unclear. If they permit
exports, it could prove catastrophic for their own people and
governments -- but if they cut them off, it could be equally
catastrophic for China. Such a situation cannot be regarded as anything
other than a menace to world peace.

Around 1640, a series of intense droughts caused widespread crop
failures in China, leading to unrest and uprisings which, in 1644,
brought down the Ming Dynasty. A [serious
domestic]{.underline} [Chinese]{.underline} [food]{.underline} and
water [crisis]{.underline} today -- driven by drought, degradation of
land and water and climate change in northern China coupled with failure
in food imports -- [could cause a]{.underline} [re-run]{.underline} [of
history]{.underline}: 'The forthcoming water crisis may impact China's
social, economic, and political stability to a great extent', a US
Intelligence Assessment found. 'The adverse impacts of climate change
will add extra pressure to existing social and resource stresses.' 68

Such [events have the potential
to]{.underline} [precipitate]{.underline} tens, even [hundreds, of
millions]{.underline} [of]{.underline} [emigrants]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [refugees]{.underline} [into
countries all over the world,]{.underline} [with]{.underline} [domino
consequences]{.underline} for those countries that receive them.
Strategic analysts have speculated that tens of [millions
of]{.underline} [desperate]{.underline} [Chinese flooding
into]{.underline} eastern [Russia]{.underline}, [or]{.underline} even [India]{.underline},
could [lead to]{.underline} war, including the risk
of [international]{.underline} [nuclear]{.underline} [exchange]{.underline}.69

Against such a scenario are the plain facts that China is a
technologically advanced society, with the foresight, wealth and
capacity to plan and implement nationwide changes and the will, if
necessary, to enforce them. Its leaders are clearly alert to the food
and water challenge -- and its resolution may well depend on the extent
of water recycling they are able to achieve. As to whether the PRC can
afford the cost of transitioning from an unsustainable to a sustainable
food system, all countries have a choice between unproductive military
spending and feeding their populace. A choice between food or war. It
remains to be seen which investment China favours.

However, it is vital to understand that the problem of whether China can
feed itself through the twentyfirst century is not purely a Chinese
problem. It's a problem, both economic and physical, for the entire
planet -- and it is thus in everyone's best interest to help solve it.
For this reason, China is rated number 3 on this list of potential
food/war hotspots.

Africa

[Food wars]{.underline} -- that is, wars in which food, land and water
play a significant contributing role -- have [been
a]{.underline} [constant]{.underline} in the [story
of]{.underline} [Africa]{.underline} since the mid twentieth century,
indeed, far longer. In a sense, the [continent is already
a]{.underline} [microcosm]{.underline} [of the world]{.underline} of the
twentyfirst century [as]{.underline} climate change and [resource
scarcity]{.underline} [combine]{.underline} [with rapid population
growth to]{.underline} [ratchet
up]{.underline} the [tensions]{.underline} [that lead
competing]{.underline} [groups]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [fight,
whether]{.underline} the superficial [distinctions]{.underline} [between
them
are]{.underline} [ethnic]{.underline}, [religious]{.underline}, [social]{.underline} [or]{.underline} [political]{.underline}.

We have [examined]{.underline} the particular cases
of [Rwanda]{.underline}, [South
Sudan]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the [Horn of
Africa]{.underline} -- [but there are numerous other African
conflicts]{.underline}, insurgencies and ongoing disturbances [in which
food]{.underline}, land and
water [are]{.underline} [primary]{.underline} or
secondary [triggers]{.underline} and where famine is often the outcome:
Nigeria, Congo, Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, Mali, Chad, the Central African
Republic, the Maghreb region of the Sahara, Mozambique, Cote d'Ivoire
and Zimbabwe have [all experienced conflicts in which issues
of]{.underline} [access]{.underline} [to food]{.underline}, land and
water [were]{.underline} [important]{.underline} [drivers]{.underline} and
consequences.

The trajectory of Africa's population in the first two decades of the
twentyfirst century implies that the number of its people could
quadruple from 1.2 billion in 2017 to 4.5 billion by 2100 (Figure 5.6).
If fulfilled, this would make Africans 41 per cent of the world
population by the end of the century. The UN Population Division's
nearer projections are for Africans to outnumber Chinese or Indians at
1.7 billion by 2030, and reach 2.5 billion in 2050, which represents a
doubling in the continent's inhabitants in barely 30 years.70 While
African fertility rates (babies per woman) remain high by world
standards -- 4.5 compared with a global average of 2.4 -- they have also
fallen steeply, from a peak of 8.5 babies in the 1970s. Furthermore, the
picture is uneven with birthrates in most Sub-Saharan countries
remaining high (around five to six babies/woman), while those of eight,
mainly southern, countries have dropped to replacement or below (i.e.
under 2.1). As has been the case around the world, birth rates tend to
drop rapidly with the spread of urbanisation, education and economic
growth -- whereas countries which slide back into poverty tend to
experience rising birthrates. Food access is a vital ingredient in this
dynamic: it has been widely observed that better-fed countries tend to
have much lower rates of birth and population growth, possibly because
people who are food secure lose fewer infants and children in early life
and thus are more open to family planning. So, in a real sense, food
sufficiency holds one of the keys to limiting the human population to a
level sustainable both for Africa and the planet in general.

\[Figure omitted\]

Forecasting the future of Africa is not easy, given the complexity of
the interwoven climatic, social, technological and political issues --
and many do not attempt it. However, the relentless optimism of the UN
and its food agency, the FAO, is probably not justified by the facts as
they are known to science -- and may have more to do with not wishing to
give offence to African governments or discourage donors than with
attempting to accurately analyse what may occur. Even the FAO
acknowledges however that food insecurity is rising across Sub-Saharan
Africa as well as other parts.

In 2017, conflict and insecurity were the major drivers of acute food
insecurity in 18 countries and territories where almost 74 million
food-insecure people were in need of urgent assistance. Eleven of these
countries were in Africa and accounted for 37 million acutely food
insecure people; the largest numbers were in northern Nigeria,
Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia and South Sudan

the agency said in its Global Report on Food Crises 2018.71

The FAO also noted that almost one in four Africans was undernourished
in 2016 -- a total of nearly a quarter of a billion people. The [rise
in]{.underline} undernourishment and [food insecurity]{.underline} [was
linked to]{.underline} the effects of climate change, natural disasters
and [conflict]{.underline} [according
to]{.underline} Bukar [Tijani]{.underline}, [the FAO's assistant
director general for Africa]{.underline}.72

Even the comparatively prosperous nation of [South Africa
sits]{.underline} [on
a]{.underline} [conflict]{.underline} [knife-edge]{.underline},
according to a scientific study: 'Results indicate that the [country
exceeds its]{.underline} environmental [boundaries]{.underline} for
biodiversity loss, marine harvesting, freshwater use, and climate
change, and that social deprivation was most severe in the areas of
safety, income, and employment, [which are]{.underline} [significant
factors]{.underline} [in conflict risk]{.underline}', Megan Cole and
colleagues found.73

In the Congo, home to the world's second largest tropical forest, 20
years of civil war had not only slain five million civilians but also
decimated the forests and their ecological services on which the nation
depended. Researchers found evidence that reducing conflict can also
help to reduce environmental destruction: 'Peace-building can
potentially be a win for nature as well, and\... conservation
organizations and governments should be ready to seize conservation
opportunities'. 74

As the African population doubles toward the mid century, as its water,
soils, forests and economic wealth per capita dwindle, as foreign
corporations plunder its riches, as a turbulent climate hammers its
herders and farmers -- both industrial and traditional -- the prospect
of [Africa]{.underline} resolving existing [conflicts]{.underline} and
avoiding new ones is receding. The mistake most of the world is making
is to imagine this only affects the Africans. The consequences [will
impact]{.underline} everyone on [the planet]{.underline}.

A World Bank study has warned that 140 million people will have to leave
just three regions of the world as climate refugees before 2050 -- and
the vast majority of these, some 86 million, would be displaced from
their homes in Sub-Saharan Africa.75 The second decade of the
twentyfirst century has already witnessed a blow-out in the number of
Sub-Saharan Africans fleeing north, across the desert into the already
dangerously overstressed region of North Africa. From there many have
headed by boat for Europe, with shocking loss of life on the way -- up
to 5000 deaths due to drowning in a single year. The number of Africans
fleeing across the Mediterranean has fluctuated, climbing as high as a
third of a million people (in 2016) with most of them headed for Italy,
followed by Greece, Cyprus and Spain. By this time Europe already had a
population of five million Sub-Saharans.76

It is worth recalling, for a moment, that a [food
failure]{.underline} in the North African grainbowl in the third and
fourth centuries [was a]{.underline} [primary factor]{.underline} [in
the]{.underline} [collapse]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [demolition]{.underline} [of
the Roman Empire]{.underline}, from Britain to Asia Minor.

The [risk of a]{.underline} [tsunami of people]{.underline} [attempting
to escape Africa for Europe, and]{.underline} to a lesser degree [the
Middle East]{.underline}, in coming decades [is building
with]{.underline} [ominous]{.underline} [intensity]{.underline}. The
stress in SubSaharan Africa is already forcing conditions in North
African countries closer to crisis point. [Were]{.underline} their [food
systems to fail in]{.underline} [domino-succession]{.underline},
the [scale of potential movement
of]{.underline} desperate [people]{.underline} into Europe can only be
guessed -- but [is]{.underline} [certainly]{.underline} [in the range
of]{.underline} tens to [hundreds of millions]{.underline}. Large
enough, in other words, to swamp the nations of Italy, Spain and Greece
and eliminate their governments altogether, forcing many of their own
people in turn to flee into northern Europe. Given the crisis caused by
a million Syrians fleeing into Europe in
2013, [the]{.underline} [consequences]{.underline} [for European
stability and the world economy]{.underline} of an African eruption tens
or hundreds of times the size [can]{.underline} [only]{.underline} [be
imagined]{.underline}.

The good news is that, in the view of the World Bank, up to 80 per cent
of Africa's climate refugees could be prevented from leaving their homes
in the first place by timely climate and development (i.e. food, land
and water) action taken by the rest of the world. The bad news, however,
is that most of the world's large oil and coal companies and their
climate-denying puppet governments remain implacably opposed to the sort
and scale of action necessary, preferring to pull the global house down
on their own heads.

Canadian ecologist Paul Chefurka argued in a far-sighted paper that the
outlook for Africa by 2040 was grim, even if the continent were able to
lock in a 1 per cent year-on-year increase in farm yields. Even then
Africa might still be forced to spend half its wealth -- an almost
impossible proportion -- on food imports by 2050, assuming sufficient
affordable food was available globally to supply them. Chefurka argued
the solutions were:

First, the developed world must get its act together when it comes to
foreign aid. Our lack of performance with regard to the Millennium
Development Goals is beyond contemptible. A minuscule sliver of the GDP
of the richest nations could help prevent a catastrophic outcome for
hundreds of millions of people and scores of countries. That we have
failed our African brothers and sisters so egregiously is a shame that
should follow all of us into the afterlife.

Second, and most importantly, we must develop an immediate crash program
of education and contraception in all the regions at risk from this
gathering storm. Africa may be the first, but the conditions are ripe
for much of South Asia to follow in their footsteps. We must blanket
Africa with schools and family planning clinics.77

There is substance to both points. Unfortunately expanding conventional
farming with a view to feeding all the Africans in 2050 and 2100 is
unlikely to succeed. It is a twentieth-century solution to a
twentyfirst-century problem, even with more advanced farming
technologies added. It would unleash cataclysmic soil and water loss,
gross pollution, the spread of deserts and animal, plant and human
diseases, accelerate climate change (through land clearing and the use
of fossil fuels and fertilisers) and extinguish the last of Africa's
wildlife. The combined [outcome]{.underline} of this [would
be]{.underline} [war]{.underline}, potentially [on
a]{.underline} [continent-wide scale]{.underline} -- and it is for this
reason Africa ranks second on this list of world food and war hotspots.

Where the true solutions to Africa's and the world's food challenges may
lie is dealt with in the concluding chapters of this book.

South Asia

The [constellation of]{.underline} [burgeoning]{.underline} [food
demand]{.underline}, water scarcity, degrading land, a turbulent
climate, social, political and religious
feuding [and]{.underline} [rampant]{.underline} [militarisation]{.underline} [make]{.underline} [the
region of]{.underline} [South Asia]{.underline} -- India, Pakistan,
Bangladesh and Sri Lanka -- the most [dangerous]{.underline} of all [for
civilisation]{.underline} during the twentyfirst century.

The population of the region has more than tripled since the 1960s.
India alone is looking at a population of 1.73 billion by 2050, Pakistan
at 306 million, Bangladesh 202 million and Sri Lanka at 23 million -- a
combined total approaching 2.3 billion.78 The Indo-Gangetic Plain is the
bread-basket of the three largest countries and currently feeds more
than 900 million from both surface and groundwater.

'India is facing a perfect storm in managing water. Centuries of
mismanagement, political and institutional incompetence, indifference at
central, state and municipal levels, a steadily increasing population
that will reach an estimated 1.7 billion by 2050, a rapidly mushrooming
middle class demanding an increasingly protein-rich diet that requires
significantly more water to produce -- together, these are leading the
country towards disaster\', says Professor Asit Biswas of the National
University of Singapore.79 'India is now facing a water situation that
is significantly worse than any that previous generations have had to
face. All Indian water bodies within and near population centres are now
grossly polluted\... Not a single Indian city can provide clean water
that can be consumed from the tap on a 24x7 basis', he adds. This was
underlined by a warning from the Indian Supreme Court in 2018 that the
capital, New Delhi -- population 25 million -- was on track to run out
of groundwater completely.80 Facing similar water scarcity were 20 other
Indian cities, including Bangalore and Hyderabad -- heartbeat of the
Indian high-tech boom -- menacing the lives and jobs of 600 million
Indians.81

Free electricity and cheap diesel pumps led to an explosion in the
extraction of groundwater across the Indo-Gangetic plain. 'The best
estimate is that at present India uses 230--250 cubic kilometres of
groundwater each year. This accounts for about one-quarter of the global
groundwater use. More than 60% of irrigated agriculture and 85% of
domestic water use now depends on groundwater.' Over large areas,
India's groundwater levels have been falling precipitously, in places at
rates of a metre or more a year, since the start of the twentyfirst
century and scientists fear its reserves will be largely exhausted by
2050.82

The World Resources Institute, which keeps a hawk-like gaze on global
water issues, notes that more than half of India is already water
stressed, affecting more than 600 million people -- and the situation
will become extremely grave towards 2040 (Figure 5.7).83

Climate change is only making matters worse for South Asia -- the rising
intensity of droughts, floods and heatwaves threatens to undermine the
region's fragile ability to feed itself. Indeed, according to some
projections, parts will be so hot as to become uninhabitable and
unfarmable.84 Recent climate modelling identified India as the world's
second most vulnerable country for climate-related hunger, and
Bangladesh third, with the situation worsening towards 2 C of global
warming.85 The Indian Ministry of Finance concurs, warning that climate
could shrink agricultural incomes by as much as 25 per cent in
unirrigated farmland and 18 per cent in irrigated areas by 2100.86

South Asia's main water reserve, the glacial ice of the Hindu Kush and
Himalaya which supports two billion people, is in dire straits,
according to a study by 210 scientists. A third of it will be gone by
2100, in a 'climate crisis you haven't heard of', said lead author
Philippus Wester. Its loss due to global warming holds catastrophic
consequences for rivers, groundwater, food production and the cities
that rely on it.87

'Climate change is likely to have a detrimental effect on South Asia out
to 2030 and beyond, mainly because of its ability to exacerbate one of
South Asia's biggest challenges: an expanding population and the
challenge of feeding, housing, clothing, watering and employing it',
wrote analyst Benjamin Walsh.88 Melting glaciers, increased evaporation
and swelling cities are all intensifying existing food and water
insecurity and, since climate change cannot be prevented in the short
run, governments had better prepare for it, he said. In this sense,
Walsh and Biswas tender similar advice: whether or not South Asia can
ride out the 'perfect storm' will depend on the competence and
determination of hitherto somewhat inept governments in taking the
essential steps to conserve water and find new ways to produce food. The
subcontinent's existing food and water model is broken and cannot
survive the mid century.

On the positive side is the enthusiasm with which South Asia has
embraced renewable energy and the IT revolution, expressed in the
region's strong economic growth. These demonstrate that vast and rapid
national and regional changes are possible. Water, land and food,
however, present far more intractable problems -- social, political and
technical -- on which age-old disputes over religion, ethnicity and
caste lie like a pall.

Since India and Pakistan partitioned in 1947, there has been ongoing
low-level conflict over the waters of the Indus and the territory of
Kashmir. Pakistan considers India is stealing its water and trying to
assert hegemony through dam-building, while India claims Pakistan is
losing water due to climate change: the scarcer water becomes for either
country, the more the tensions escalate. Both sides are heavily armed:
India has 2.1 million soldiers under arms, and Pakistan 644,000. Both
nations have 120+ nuclear warheads. Between them, they spend US\$65
billion a year on their militaries.89 How close they have been to open
war is highlighted by legal expert Dr Waseem Quereshi:
'The [tension]{.underline} over water
conflicts [between]{.underline} [India]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [Pakistan]{.underline} [has
been]{.underline} [soaring]{.underline}. India has threatened that it
will scrap the IWT \[Indus Waters Treaty\] entirely. In response,
Pakistan has stated that such a revocation of a bilaterally agreed
treaty would be considered an act of war'. 90

Large-scale [food]{.underline}, land and
water [failures]{.underline} anywhere [on the]{.underline} [Indian
subcontinent]{.underline} [could spark]{.underline} [immense refugee
movements]{.underline} in the tens or hundreds of millions, [capable
of]{.underline} [obliterating]{.underline} neighbour [countries
and]{.underline} [igniting]{.underline} [wars]{.underline}. They
are [liable to be on a scale that]{.underline} [dwarfs]{.underline} [the
Syrian refugee problem]{.underline} into
insignificance, [with]{.underline} [worldwide
repercussions]{.underline}. For example, some 130 million people on the
subcontinent inhabit low-lying coastal regions that will be under the
sea by 210091, and that is but a single dimension of the climate--water
crisis. The World Bank rates the Indian subcontinent the world's second
most vulnerable region for enforced climate migration, with 40 million
climate refugees alone in India by 2050.92 These estimates take no
account of the scale of migration that could result from major failures
in food or water, or people fleeing resulting conflicts.

The scenario of major collapse in the South Asian food and water system
is so appalling that no government or agency, as yet, seems prepared
even to contemplate its possibility, or to risk the displeasure of South
Asian governments and peoples by speaking openly about it. As a result,
the world at large is doing little to forestall or prevent it. However,
for whatever the vox populi is worth, when the website Debate.org asked
readers to vote on the question "Will India Collapse?", 76 per cent of
respondents (mostly Indians) were of the view that it would.93 The [Oslo
Peace Research Institute]{.underline}, in a rather more structured
attempt to [predict]{.underline} the [likelihood]{.underline} [of future
conflicts]{.underline} based on past
behaviour, [rated]{.underline} [Pakistan]{.underline}, [India]{.underline}, [Afghanistan]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [Sri
Lanka]{.underline} among the countries [more likely to face
wars]{.underline} up to 2050.94

The [great issue for humanity is South
Asia's]{.underline} [combined]{.underline} [arsenal of 250+ nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. Though many of these are thought to be
'battlefield' or tactical nukes (as opposed to city busters), there
are [enough]{.underline} of them [to cause a]{.underline} [worldwide
famine]{.underline} affecting everybody and lasting several years. This
insight arises out of the increasing sophistication of global climate
models, which can now describe the impact of nuclear release on the
global climate system with far greater precision than ever before.
Meteorologist Alan [Robock]{.underline} from Rutgers
University [and]{.underline} physicist Brian [Toon]{.underline} from the
University of Colorado have [devoted]{.underline} 30 [years
to]{.underline} [projecting the effects]{.underline} o[f nuclear
war]{.underline}. They estimate that a [limited
nuclear]{.underline} [exchange]{.underline} between India and
Pakistan [would throw up]{.underline} at least [five million tonnes
of]{.underline} [dust]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [smoke]{.underline} from
burning forests and incinerated cities, lofting it into the high
atmosphere where it will linger for up to 20 years. In climatic terms,
this [would be the]{.underline} [equivalent]{.underline} [of
an]{.underline} [asteroid impact]{.underline} [on Earth]{.underline} or
a large volcanic eruption, they said -- [enough
to]{.underline} [unleash]{.underline} [a]{.underline} [worldwide
'nuclear]{.underline} [winter']{.underline}. 95

'We put it into a NASA climate model and found it would be the largest
climate change in recorded human history', Brian Toon told a journalist.
'The basic physics is very simple. If you block out the Sun, it gets
cold and dark at the Earth's surface'. 96

He continued: 'We hypothesized that if each country used half of their
nuclear arsenal, that would be 50 weapons on each side. We assumed the
simplest bomb, which is the size dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki -- a
15 kiloton bomb. The answer is the global average temperature would go
down by about 1.5 degrees Celsius. In the middle of continents,
temperature drops would be larger and last for a decade or more'. The
effects of this snap cooling on agriculture worldwide were then
calculated. The answer was equally chilling: harvests would crash by
20--40 per cent for five years, and for the next five years, linger
10--20 per cent below the pre-war norm. This [would result
in]{.underline} malnourishment, if not [outright
starvation]{.underline}, [for]{.underline} most of [the world's
population]{.underline} (Figure 5.8).

Such an event would be more severe than the Little Ice Age of the
eighteenth century -- which was, it may be recalled, a likely
contributing factor in the hunger that led to the French Revolution --
or the cool period that brought down the Roman Empire in the fourth
century. In today's overcrowded world it would unleash global hunger,
reducing the average daily caloric intake from 2900 to 1900--2000
calories or fewer, which is borderline malnutrition. For people already
hungry, such an outcome would be fatal.

Yet that is not the worst of it. A report by International Physicians
for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW) concluded that China, lying
immediately downwind of India/Pakistan, would be worst affected by the
nuclear winter effects of even a limited atomic war in South Asia.
Chinese winter wheat production would fall by up to half, and the rice
crop by 21 per cent.

Two billion [people]{.underline} in India and
China [would]{.underline} [starve]{.underline} within
months, [government]{.underline} in both
countries [would]{.underline} probably [disintegrate]{.underline} and[,]{.underline} in
an echo of their own and Roman histories, the [remnants of society
would]{.underline} doubtless [be]{.underline} [riven among local
warlords]{.underline}. Most of the nations of Southeast, West, North and
Central Asia on their borders would be swept away before the tide of
people fleeing the catastrophe.97

How such events would play out for the rest of the world are not easy to
predict -- but, in all likelihood, the [panic]{.underline} occasioned by
rising global hunger, soaring global food prices and the loss of two of
its largest
traders [would]{.underline} [crash]{.underline} [the]{.underline} world [economy]{.underline}, [toppling]{.underline} more [governments
and]{.underline} [igniting]{.underline} further [civil and international
conflict]{.underline}, some of
it [potentially]{.underline} [nuclear]{.underline}.

Thus, even a relatively limited nuclear exchange, such as between India
and Pakistan, could bring civilisation as we know it to an end. From
this brief assessment it can be seen that the Indian subcontinent, more
than any region on Earth, holds the key to the future of world food
security and hence, the fate of civilisation in this century. For this
reason, the South Asian region is rated as the Number One Risk on this
list, in terms of food, land and water insecurity and conflict risk,
above all others.

#### Alaskan Wildfire Smoke is detrimental to migratory birds and other keystone species

**Overton**, Cory T **et al**. "Megafires and thick smoke portend big
problems for migratory birds." *Ecology* vol. 103,1 (**2022):** e03552.
doi:10.1002/ecy.3552 // Micah

In 2020, the fire season affecting the western United States reached
unprecedented levels. The 116 fires active in September consumed nearly
20,822 km2 (https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/accessible‐view/ Accessed
2020‐09‐29) with 80% of this footprint (16,567 km2) from 68 fires
occurring within California, Oregon, and Washington. Although the 2020
fire season was the most extreme on record, it exemplified patterns of
increased wildfire size, number, timing, return frequency, and extent,
which are linked to climate‐driven changes in precipitation and
temperature affecting fire ignition and severity (Westerling 2016, Goss
et al. 2020, Weber and Yadav 2020). In addition, [wildfire smoke and
particulate pollution have expanded greatly in recent decades throughout
western North America, posing a threat to both human and ecological
health]{.underline} (Burke et al. 2021). Wildfires have increasingly
coincided with the start of fall migration (Westerling 2016, Goss et al.
2020) and may present a growing risk to migrating birds in the Pacific
Flyway. **[Migrating birds across several western states were observed
dead and dying in 2020.]{.underline}** Within the Central Flyway,
starvation of insectivorous birds that were recovered in Arizona,
Colorado, and New Mexico was linked to a record cold‐weather storm in
the Rocky Mountains (Fox 2020). But causes of the nearly simultaneous
bird mortalities of larger granivorous species (Fig. 1) further west in
the Pacific Flyway, where fires were occurring, remain unclear.

(Anser albifrons) without external injury and weighing nearly half
(˜1 kg) of a healthy bird\'s expected weight (˜1.8--2 kg) was found dead

of mortality is presumed to be starvation occurring during migration.

[Birds are especially vulnerable to disruption during migration as this
is one of the most energetically demanding periods of the life
cycle]{.underline} (McWilliams et al. 2004). [Migration both follows and
precedes periods of increased foraging activity and unanticipated energy
deficits may have short‐term carry‐over effects on subsequent
demographic processes]{.underline} (Newton 2006). Physiological and
atmospheric constraints limit where, how high, and how long birds can
fly. However, behavioral and physiological adaptations that make
migration more efficient, such as using navigational cues, altering
flight elevation to take advantage of winds, and efficient blood
oxygenation are widespread across avian taxa (McWilliams et al. 2004).
Some bird species fly in formation. which provides physical efficiencies
(Mirzaeinia and Heppner 2020), but also maintains social cohesion within
family groups, which is particularly strong in geese (Kölzsch et al.
2020). Many migrating species exhibit strong site fidelity to a limited
number of stopover locations and travel routes (Weber and Houston 1999)
potentially resulting in adverse demographic outcomes if traditional
sites are not available (Klaassen et al. 2006). Such patterns of low
"migratory diversity" are associated with greater probabilities of
population decline while species with greater diversity may respond more
robustly to climate change (Gilroy et al. 2016) or stochastic events.
Temporary faculative migration from breeding ranges in advance of severe
storms has been implied from light level loggers on songbirds that are
otherwise obligate migrants (Streby et al. 2015), but a similar response
was not evident for resident scavenging birds following volcanic
eruption (Alarcón et al. 2016). It is less understood how actively
migrating species respond to similar large‐scale disruptions,
particularly in the context of route finding and energy expenditure to
traditionally used stopover regions.

Ecological investigations on the impact of wildfire on migration and
movement have generally focused either on the energetic needs and
foraging strategies of individuals or the impact of habitat or patch
loss in the landscape. Wildfire impacts on actively migrating animals,
particularly effects that extend beyond direct habitat loss within the
fire perimeter, are not well documented due to the difficulty in
obtaining migration information that spatially and temporally coincides
with large fires. Beginning in 2018, we have marked tule greater
white‐fronted geese (Anser albifrons elgasi; tule goose) with
collar‐mounted GPS‐enabled cellular transmitters to study movements and
behaviors (Overton and Casazza 2021). With only 14,700 individuals
(Yparraguirre et al. 2020), the tule goose is a Species of Special
Concern in California and exhibits near absolute fidelity to a primary
stopover site at the Summer Lake Wildlife Area in central Oregon, USA
(96%; Yparraguirre et al. 2020). Typical fall migration, as observed
from five radio‐marked individuals in 2019, starts as a nearly direct
route from the Cook Inlet in Alaska to Summer Lake that takes just over
4 d. [**The first half of fall migration between Alaska and Washington**
consists of flights over, and occasional short rests upon, the Pacific
Ocean]{.underline}. Beginning September 12, 2020, all four tule geese
were still transmitting, including a single individual that provided a
migration track in 2019, and encountered dense smoke either while flying
overland into southern Washington or while flying off the coast of
Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada and Washington, USA.

The three‐dimensional smoke forecast from NOAA\'s High‐Resolution Rapid
Refresh coupled with the Smoke (HRRR‐Smoke) model (Ahmadov, 2017) were
compared with bird movements to investigate any potential impacts of
smoke upon migration patterns. Elevational gradients of smoke
concentrations were linearly interpolated for every GPS location from
each goose to allow interpretation of individual movement behavior
relative to vertical distribution of smoke density. Geese responded to
dense smoke concentrations averaging 161 µg m−3 (Fig. 2) by either
stopping migration or altering direction and/or altitude of flights,
which resulted in increased total flight time and distance. Three birds
migrating over water stopped and rafted for 52--72 h before the smoke
cleared and then moved inland. Landward migration of geese through smoke
or directly over fires resulted in disorganized paths including both
tangential and recursive flights, acute increases in altitude to 4,000 m
to over‐fly the smoke plume, and stopovers in non‐traditional habitats
occurring far from traditional migratory pathways (Fig. 3). Social
cohesion of migrating flocks may also have been affected. Pairs of
marked individuals migrated together twice, but groups separated each
time that flocks were stopped in the smoke. One individual (Bird
#192587) transited the fires but continued following prevailing winds
within the smoke plume away from Summer Lake, arriving in Idaho where
tule goose occurrence has never been confirmed (Fig. 3). [Ultimately,
all individuals arrived at Summer Lake after delays caused by smoke
which more than doubled average migration duration (4.18 d in 2019 vs.
9.11 d in 2020; +118%) and extended the average flightpath during
migration by 757 km (+27%).]{.underline}

2020 (b; n = 4) through arrival at Summer Lake Wildlife Area, Oregon,
USA across areas experiencing massive wildfires in 2020 which resulted
in aberrant migration behavior, increased energetic demands, and
increased mortality risk. Routes during 2020 encountered smoke plumes
initially over the Pacific Ocean or Olympic Peninsula. Maximum extent
impacted by wildfire smoke of sufficient concentration to disrupt
waterfowl migration (\>161 µg m−3; red) encompassed an area equal to 64%
of four western states (California, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington) on
September 12, 2020 and was \>44 times larger than the combined area
directly impacted by the wildfire. Basemap source: Esri, HERE, Garman,
Open StreetMap contributors, and the GIS user community.

Total energetic deficit resulting from delayed arrival at Summer Lake
and extra distance flown was estimated using values from existing
literature (see Appendix S1: Section S3). Total increased energetic
expenditure averaged 950 kcals (3,977 kJ; observed range 404--1,118
kcals) which is equivalent to nearly 4.4 d of thermally neutral
metabolism or 2.27 d encompassing normal activities during the winter.
The duration of additional foraging needed to compensate for this
caloric deficit is 27.5--42 h. Pre‐breeding Canada geese (Branta
canadensis) increase time spent feeding five‐fold to nearly 31% of the
day implying that even when feeding at behavioral extremes these
energetic deficits would take 4--6 days before recovery. Energy deficits
such as we describe, especially when occurring in the context of
incomplete knowledge of available food resource locations, can lead to
increased mortality or reproductive rates insufficient to maintain goose
populations (Klaasen et al. 2005).

We observed impacts to individual migratory behavior at smoke
concentrations averaging 161 µg m−3. At ground surface elevations, smoke
concentrations exceeded this threshold across a geographic extent 27
times greater than the area burned by wildfires. However, at observed
migration altitudes (\<4,000 m), this smoke concentration covered an
area 44 times larger than the wildfires themselves, encompassing 64% of
four western states (California, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington) and
effectively transecting the Pacific Flyway (Fig. 3).

Peak migration through the Pacific Flyway states of Washington, Oregon,
and California, occurs when wildfires have become more intense, larger,
and more frequent due to climatic variation and anthropogenic influences
such as fire suppression and invasive plants (Goss et al. 2020, Weber
and Yadav 2020). [Wildfires in 2020 produced substantial barriers to
bird navigation and movement across wide geographic extents, affecting
route selection and energy expenditure sufficient to produce
long‐lasting effects. Limitations in high quality stopover sites due to
continuing reductions in wetland extent within the Northern Great Basin
(Donnelly et al. 2019) may exacerbate the impacts to migrating birds of
larger and later occurring wildfires in western North
America.]{.underline} Other species of geese, ducks, shorebirds, and
passerines rely on similar traditional pathways and navigational cues
and face comparable physiological and energetic constraints. The results
we report for tule greater white‐fronted geese may reflect significant
challenges faced by a broader constituency of migrating birds,
particularly those with low migratory diversity (Gilroy et al. 2016)
[and portend a future of increased challenges]{.underline} (Pickrell and
Pennisi 2020) for migratory bird populations.

#### Alaskan forests are key to migratory bird species'- wildfires destroy habitats and lead to mass die-offs

**Parshley 24** \[Lois Parshley, \"Alaska\'s vast boreal forest and its
species face a reckoning\", June 09, 2024, Mother Jones,

Accessed July 18, 2025\] // Micah

In the first flush of an Arctic spring, the boreal forest begins to
stir, emerging from a silvered quiet. Icicles shatter like glass.
Meltwater babbles, braiding in puddles and then in deltas. Snow drops in
clumps from the branches of black spruce. Saplings remain crooked from a
long wait, as if Dr. Seuss had drawn springtime.

The trees' twisted crowns are evidence of the forest's scrappiness: A
black spruce seed riding the wind in 1728---the year the first Danish
explorer crossed the Bering Sea between Asia and North America---might
have found purchase in the rocky till revealed by retreating glaciers.
When ice turned Captain Cook back from the Arctic Ocean a few decades
later, the sapling would have just been bearing its first cones. A
century later, when the United States purchased Alaska from Russia for
\$7.2 million in gold, the slow-growing tree might only have reached 30
feet. By the time the 1980 Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation
Act created the sprawling system that now manages many of these forests,
the aging spruce might still have been a spindly perch for some of the
billions of birds that wing north as the days lengthen.

These flocks have thinned in recent years. One in three of the birds
that used to make the arrowing trip have disappeared. [The boreal
forest,]{.underline} meanwhile, [is now teetering]{.underline}. As
temperatures rise, [the permafrost that supported its roots is thawing,
drowning whole stands. Many of its trees have been logged, and
development has plowed through its muskeg, destroying the habitat that
more than half of North America's birds rely on. **The majority of
Alaska's bird species are now at least moderately vulnerable to
extinction.**]{.underline}

"[Our mandates are all about biodiversity and maintaining species,"
Magness says. "But what happens when you can't?"]{.underline}

Statistics like these paint a world in an orderly decline, where change
can be methodically tabled and tracked. But the boreal doesn't neatly
begin and end. Its very name betrays the folly of artificial
separations.

MOTHER JONES TOP STORIES

The forest's moniker is drawn from Boreas, the Greek god of the north
wind, a word that in turn stems from the earlier Balto-Slavic for
"forest" and "mountain." All of its ancient meanings hold the idea of
great distance, of the connections between air and land and trees.
Spruce are a keystone of one of the world's largest biomes, and
together, the forest and the birds that fill its skies are pieces of a
rich biological puzzle. While the boreal encompasses about a third of
the world's forests, it also holds more fresh water than any other
ecosystem, with vast wetlands and shorelines providing sanctuary for
millions of birds that stop to rest before continuing on to the tundra
or, at last, the sea.

George Matz, an avid birder, has watched these migrations for decades.
On a recent chilly morning, he stood on the mudflats of Homer, Alaska,
lifting the binoculars around his neck as a pair of sandhill cranes
kited and swooped toward shore. The Kenai Peninsula marks the edge of
Alaska's boreal forest. While its western coast is stubbled with spruce,
its eastern fjords hold the rainforests of the Pacific maritime, a
lusher ecosystem that continues down the coast of Canada.

On this brink between the two, Matz has been counting birds for the last
16 years. Faithfully watching the rocky beaches as the snow begins to
recede, he and a small group of volunteer birders have developed a
database that documents the peninsula's changes. From these records,
Matz says, "We can get an idea of overall populations, and how climate
change affects trends."

[Much like the birds Matz watches, the boreal forest is also migrating,
warming more rapidly than nearly any other place on Earth]{.underline}.
In a series of satellite images from 1985 to 2019, scientists at
Northern Arizona University found that the warmest margins of the forest
are now browning, with so many trees perishing you could watch them die
from space. Meanwhile, its northern edge has been racing toward the
pole, new trunks sprouting on formerly treeless plains.

On the Kenai, the boreal's rapid retreat is jarring. The southern
peninsula is in a rain shadow, sheltered from moisture by the peaks of a
nearby ice field. "[It's not wet enough for the Pacific maritime to
advance," says Dawn Robin Magness, a landscape ecologist at the Kenai
National Wildlife Refuge. "We're at the trailing edge of a biome shift,
with no leading edge." Whatever habitat eventually emerges here, in
other words, will be new.]{.underline}

In the meantime, rising temperatures are reshaping what were once safe
harbors such as Homer, an important resting stop on the great
continental flyway that stretches from Alaska to Chile. [The common
murres that regularly splash into its warming waters have recently been
part of massive bird die-offs, their bodies littering beaches around
Alaska]{.underline}. In this wavering future, shifts that normally
happen in geological timescales are accelerating toward collapse.

Magness and her colleagues at the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge have
had to acknowledge that their longstanding goal---to maintain or restore
historical conditions---is now impossible. Instead, they've begun to use
a basic question to guide their choices: Is climate change to be
resisted, accepted, or directed? The deceptively simple question is a
radical departure from previous policies. "Our mandates are all about
biodiversity and maintaining species," Magness says. "But what happens
when you can't?"

This is not the boreal's first transformation. [For the last 12,500
years, the forest has ebbed with the rise and fall of ice at its
margins.]{.underline} During the last ice age, black spruce took root as
far south as the tablelands of Colorado and New Mexico. As the glaciers
receded, their immense weight scraped away the underlying soil, leaving
behind winding eskers and stony moraines.

Advertise with Mother Jones

In these essentially lifeless landscapes, endless cycles of freeze and
thaw cracked the exposed rock, where the first colonies of feather moss
found purchase. Dying, their decay formed new soil. Grasses took root,
splintering the bedrock. Shrubs and saplings rose. In time, deep forest
once again emerged from bare rock.

"[Tree colonization is the key to maintaining the boreal forest, **and
it's really sensitive to disturbances---especially fire."**]{.underline}

As the boreal returned to the north---the black spruce sending its
spires up from bogs and its cousin, white spruce, bristling the drier
slopes across the Arctic---the forest began to remake its world. The
trees' roots drew water up from the soil and into their needles,
billowing out as vapor when their pores opened in the sun. This process,
called transpiration, helps forests make their own rain.

Transpiration contributes roughly half of annual rainfall in European
forests, and helps drive the Amazon's seasonal monsoons. Spruce are
particularly good at it, releasing compounds that condense water
molecules---essentially seeding raindrops. Collectively, these
exhalations also make the boreal the greatest planetary source of
oxygen.

Some, in fact, suggest [the boreal may serve as a giant bellows, pumping
the planet's air circulation]{.underline}. Anastassia Makarieva, a
Russian physicist, theorizes that as trees grow clouds, they change
atmospheric pressures, encouraging air circulation and propelling wind
patterns. In many places, forests can create "flying rivers" that carry
coastal moisture inland for thousands of miles. In fact, the boreal
regions of Scandinavia and Russia provide China with more than 80
percent of its water.

Yet as the forest falters, these prodigal cycles are dwindling. [When
trees die, the loss of their transpiration can spark hotter and drier
conditions; recent models predict that deforestation will reduce
rainfall in some regions by almost a third. Hot, dry summers are killing
spruce that shrug off polar winters but can't cope with
drought]{.underline}. Higher temperatures have also catalyzed once-rare
lightning strikes across Alaska, kindling unprecedented wildfires. Every
year since 2000, 50 percent more of the Arctic has burned than in any
decade of the previous century. In satellite images, you can now see
flecks of smoldering fires that seethe through the frigid
winters---"zombie" fires biding through the cold before flaring up
again.

The outsize grandeur of the boreal can still appear so wild, so endless,
it's hard for newcomers to recognize the loss. Each generation's
perception of normal is molded by the environment they encounter,
masking the gradual fade, a diminishing world stripped of its former
richness.

Driving north to Alaska, my own first glimpse of the boreal forest was
of blackened spruce skeletons from a highway that wound through the oil
fields of Alberta. At a small roadside lake, pumpjacks worked through
the night. Someone had taken a knife to a lone birch trunk: if i fell,
would you hear me? The next morning, I ran over a yellow warbler---no
time to step off the gas. It fluttered on the macadam in the rearview
mirror as I pressed forward, the skinny spruce closing in along the
road.

"It's changed so much," says Jill Johnstone, a former professor of
biology at the University of Saskatchewan, where she started the
Northern Plant Ecology Lab. She explains that, in many ways, spruce is
made to burn. Black spruce cones hold their seeds close until fire
releases their long, thin wings. Flames will dance through the crowded
stands, jumping between resinous canopies. Occasionally, the tops of
whole trees will pop off like sparkling fireworks. The seared cones are
left open to release seeds on the newly bare soil.

**[But as more of the Arctic burns, and then burns again, wildfire is
outpacing the trees' ability to regrow]{.underline}**. In the early
2000s, after what was then a record-breaking fire year, Johnstone
established a network of research sites across the boreal. She found
that fires were returning too quickly, while trees were too young to
have produced cones. They were also burning hotter, scorching deep into
the soil, depleting critical nutrients and searing into something like
concrete. "Tree colonization is the key to maintaining the boreal
forest," she says, "and it's really sensitive to disturbances,
especially fire."

Abstract

Current nuclear arsenals used in a war between the United States and
Russia could inject 150 Tg of soot from fires ignited by nuclear
explosions into the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. We
simulate the climate response using the Community Earth System
Model-Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 4 (WACCM4), run
at 2° horizontal resolution with 66 layers from the surface to 140 km,
with full stratospheric chemistry and with aerosols from the Community
Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres allowing for particle
growth. We compare the results to an older simulation conducted in 2007
with the Goddard Institute for Space Studies ModelE run at 4° × 5°
horizontal resolution with 23 levels up to 80 km and constant specified
aerosol properties and ozone. These are the only two comprehensive
climate model simulations of this scenario. Despite having different
features and capabilities, both models produce similar results.
[[Nuclear winter]{.mark}, with below freezing temperatures over much of
the Northern Hemisphere during summer, [occurs because of a reduction of
surface solar radiation **due to smoke** lofted into the
stratosphere]{.mark}]{.underline}. WACCM4\'s more sophisticated aerosol
representation removes smoke more quickly, but the magnitude of the
climate response is not reduced. In fact, the higher-resolution WACCM4
simulates larger temperature and precipitation reductions than ModelE in
the first few years following a 150-Tg soot injection. A strengthening
of the northern polar vortex occurs during winter in both simulations in
the first year, contributing to above normal, but still below freezing,
temperatures in the Arctic and northern Eurasia.

impacts are not diminished

1 Introduction

Since the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the twentieth century,
considerable attention has been paid to the impact of a nuclear war on
society and the environment. Crutzen and Birks (1982), following
previous ideas by Lewis (1979), suggested that massive forest fires
ignited by nuclear weapons would rage for weeks after a war, producing a
tropospheric pall of smoke that would obscure the Sun and reduce
sunlight at the surface for the duration of the fires. Turco et al.
(1983) conducted the first climate modeling using a radiative-convective
climate model, showing that a nuclear winter could occur from this
smoke. In a war where nuclear weapons would be used, military and
industrial centers located in urban areas would be targeted, which
contain fuel loading much higher than forests, thus creating an enormous
amount of smoke when burned. Turco et al. (1983) found that urban fires
injecting smoke into the upper troposphere could produce severe climate
changes and that urban firestorms could inject smoke into the
stratosphere, leading to rapid interhemispheric transport and a
long-lasting smoke pall, which has since been affirmed by coupled global
climate models (Mills et al., 2008; Mills et al., 2014; Pausata et al.,
2016; Robock, Oman, & Stenchikov, 2007; Robock, Oman, Stenchikov, Toon,
et al., 2007). Aleksandrov and Stenchikov (1983) conducted the first
three-dimensional climate modeling for the injection scenarios of Turco
et al. (1983) showing that continental temperature reductions would be
large despite moderation by the oceans. Malone et al. (1985) conducted
the first three-dimensional simulations including smoke transport and
removal by precipitation, showing that solar heating could cause smoke
in the troposphere to rise into the stratosphere before precipitation
removal, greatly prolonging the lifetime of the smoke. The effect of
this smoke entering Earth\'s upper atmosphere would be to block out
sunlight for months to years, decreasing temperatures. In 1986, The
Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment of the International
Council of Scientific Unions published a report describing the immense
biological, ecological, and human impacts of a nuclear war based on the
literature at the time (Pittock et al., 1986). The first simulation with
a modern[, [comprehensive]{.mark} coupled atmosphere-ocean climate
[model]{.mark} by Robock, Oman, and Stenchikov (2007) [showed that solar
heating would loft smoke deep into the stratosphere]{.mark}. Robock,
Oman, and Stenchikov (2007) confirmed that [a nuclear winter would
result from]{.mark} the amount of [soot]{.mark} that could be produced
by a nuclear war between Russia and the United States with current
arsenal]{.underline}s (Toon et al., 2008). Later agricultural modeling
of a regional nuclear war showed an [increased likelihood of crop
failures and [global famine due to]{.mark} the climate effects of
[smoke]{.mark}]{.underline} (Xia & Robock, 2013; Xia et al., 2015). But
climate models have improved since 2007 in terms of horizontal
resolution, vertical resolution, and vertical extent, which is essential
for an accurate simulation of smoke lofting. We employ the much higher
resolution WACCM4 model used by Mills et al. (2014) to repeat the
nuclear war scenario from Robock, Oman, and Stenchikov (2007). We
incorporate a more sophisticated treatment of stratospheric chemistry
compared to Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) ModelE, and
aerosol treatment is updated from Mills et al. (2014) by treating the
aerosols as fractal particles whose optical properties evolve over time.
Only Pausata et al. (2016) has used a model to study the climate effect
of nuclear war, using a much smaller injection than here, that allowed
for the growth of aerosols in the stratosphere, but their model had a
limited vertical resolution and extent (26 levels with a 3-hPa model
top), potentially limiting vertical lofting. Mixing together varying
ratios of organic and black carbon, Pausata et al. (2016) found a
shorter stratospheric residence time of the aerosols due to particle
growth. The use of a model with a higher model top and higher vertical
resolution here should help to more accurately model the lifetime of
fractal smoke particles generated from mass fires, a key uncertainty in
this field of study.

A significant climate response is predicated on the basis that vast
amounts of smoke would reach the stratosphere, and so an accurate
representation of the properties of the aerosols and the amount is
crucial. [[The aerosols produced following]{.mark} the
[fires]{.mark}]{.underline} ignited by a nuclear explosion [[would
contain organic compounds mixed with]{.underline}]{.mark} elemental
carbon, which is also called soot or [[black
carbon]{.underline}]{.mark}. The smoke calculations from Toon et al.
([2007) excluded organic carbon, just as most historical climate
simulations did, so while including it could increase particle
extinction and reduce soot residence time in the
stratosphere,]{.underline} as Pausata et al. (2016) found, we exclude it
as well. Black carbon is one of the most efficient aerosols at absorbing
visible light, allowing for the surrounding air to become buoyant when
the aerosols are heated (Ackerman & Toon, 1981; Bond et al., 2013; Turco
et al., 1983). For example, a stratospheric injection of a few tenths of
a teragram of smoke, containing a few percent of black carbon, from a
forest fire in British Columbia in August of 2017 heated the air by
about 7 K by absorbing sunlight and lofted the smoke from an injection
height of about 12 km to above 20-km altitude within a few weeks (e.g.,
Khaykin et al., 2018; Peterson et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2019). In
contrast, 180 Tg of black carbon (excluding organic compounds that would
also be emitted) might be injected in a full scale nuclear war between
the United States and Russia from convective plumes from fires (Toon et
al., 2008). [[Self-lofting would allow the aerosols to rise deep into
the stratosphere, resulting in a long-duration climate
response]{.underline}]{.mark} (Malone et al., 1985, 1986; Robock, Oman,
& Stenchikov, 2007, Robock, Oman, Stenchikov, Toon, et al., 2007).
Without precipitation to act as a removal mechanism, aerosols would
remain in the stratosphere for months to years depending on particle
size. Robock, Oman, and Stenchikov (2007) used a model that did not
include aerosol particle coagulation and growth and found an e-folding
lifetime of 4.6 years for soot particles in the stratosphere. However,
simulations of massive soot injections of tens of thousands of teragram
of black carbon following the impact that killed the dinosaurs showed
that particle coagulation should occur, producing large soot particles
with greater fall speeds (Bardeen et al., 2017; Toon et al., 2016).

Volcanic eruption clouds provide a well-observed analog for particle
lifetimes and climate effects. Sulfate aerosols generated from gases
injected into the stratosphere by volcanic eruptions cause global
cooling due to the reflection of incoming solar radiation back to space,
which has been observed numerous times and modeled successfully (Robock,
2000). Simulations of volcanic clouds including particle growth show
that large volcanic eruptions, such as that of Mt. Pinatubo with 35 Tg
of sulfate aerosols, produce clouds with lifetimes of about 1 year, as
observed (Barnes & Hoffman, 1997; Deshler, 2008). However, numerical
simulations suggest that larger eruptions, which are not well observed,
will produce large particles with shorter lifetimes (English et al.,
2013; Pinto et al., 1989). Volcanic aerosols are not transported as high
as black carbon aerosols as they are only weakly absorptive and do not
self-loft significantly (Robock, Oman, & Stenchikov, 2007).
**[[Wildfires]{.underline}]{.mark}** pale in comparison to the Mt.
Pinatubo cloud mass, but their aerosols [[can heat the air enough to be
lofted 8 km vertically]{.underline}]{.mark} (Yu et al., 2019). An
injection of 150 Tg of black carbon would be a far greater aerosol
loading than wildfire contributions or any volcanic eruptions from the
past 100 years (when masses can be reliably determined) but would be
orders of magnitude smaller than injections of black carbon into the
atmosphere 66 million years ago when an asteroid impact caused much of
the biomass on Earth\'s surface to burn, resulting in a mass extinction
event (Bardeen et al., 2017; Toon et al., 2016). Volcanic eruptions and
[[mass fires are]{.underline}]{.mark} both [[effective methods of
injecting aerosols into the stratosphere]{.underline}]{.mark}, but the
black carbon produced by nuclear mass fires, like what is simulated
here, results in far more extreme climate effects per unit mass.

[[Cooling]{.underline}]{.mark} at the surface is only one of many
phenomena that would [[occur if abundant black carbon aerosols are
injected into the stratosphere]{.underline}]{.mark}. Several modeling
studies have shown that stratospheric temperatures would increase by
more than 50 K and stratospheric ozone would undergo global destruction,
even for a scenario where 5 Tg of soot is injected into the stratosphere
(Mills et al., 2014; Robock, Oman, Stenchikov, Toon, et al., 2007; Toon
et al., 2007). The global hydrologic cycle would become far less active,
with a reduction in summer monsoon precipitation and a significantly
reduced growing season (Robock, Oman, & Stenchikov, 2007; Robock, Oman,
Stenchikov, Toon, et al., 2007). The impacts on human society would be
devastating due to agricultural losses alone, even from the 5-Tg
scenario (Xia & Robock, 2013; Xia et al., 2015). Research on the climate
impacts of volcanic eruptions has found similar, although usually less
severe, consequences as a result of global cooling due to smaller
stratospheric aerosol loadings (Robock, 2000).

There are many uncertainties in computing the climate after a nuclear
conflict. The greatest uncertainty is how many weapons would be used,
what yields would be employed, and which targets would be chosen. This
uncertainty cannot be reduced, so ideally, a range of scenarios must be
considered to understand the full spectrum of impacts. Using the
high-end scenario from Robock, Oman, and Stenchikov (2007), we assume a
war between Russia and the United States, involving numbers of weapons
allowed under current treaties. The area burned, the amount of fuel
available, the amount of smoke and black carbon produced by the fires,
as well as the injection altitudes of the smoke, are also uncertain. We
use the approach of Toon et al. (2007) who estimated that 180 Tg of
black carbon could be emitted into the upper troposphere. Following
Robock, Oman, and Stenchikov (2007), we round this estimate downward to
150 Tg, which would double the 20% of black carbon rain-out assumed by
Toon et al. (2007) and used by Mills et al. (2008). The soot aerosols
are emitted over the continental areas of the United States and Russia
following the same idealized approach from Robock, Oman, and Stenchikov
(2007). The climate response and smoke removal mechanisms may also
differ between models. To date, only Robock, Oman, and Stenchikov (2007)
have used a modern climate model to simulate this particular scenario of
an all out nuclear war between the United States and Russia. Here we
repeat the nuclear war scenario from Robock, Oman, and Stenchikov (2007)
using an alternative state-of-the-art modern climate model run at higher
resolution and with a more explicit simulation of stratospheric
chemistry and aerosols. We then compare our new results to the GISS
ModelE simulations from Robock, Oman, and Stenchikov (2007) to help
determine how sensitive the climate changes may be to the details of the
model and to further constrain the lifetime of black carbon aerosols
during this type of black carbon injection.

2 Methods

We use the Community Earth System Model with the Whole Atmosphere
Community Climate Model, version 4 (WACCM4) for its atmospheric
component. The model has a horizontal resolution of 1.9° × 2.5°
(lat-lon), with 66 vertical layers and a model top of 140 km (Marsh,
Mills, Kinnison, Lamarque, Calvo, et al., 2013; Bardeen et al., 2017).
The Community Land Model 4.0 is used as the land surface model, Parallel
Ocean Program v2 is the ocean model, atmospheric CO2 is set at a
constant 370 ppm (levels during the year 2000, same as GISS ModelE),
tropospheric aerosols (other than black carbon) are prescribed, and
ocean biogeochemistry is included. While full tropospheric chemistry is
not included, the transport and removal of soot from fires is handled by
the Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (CARMA). CARMA
is a sectional aerosol model, which in this case treats soot as fractal
particles (Bardeen et al., 2008, 2017; Toon et al., 1988; Turco et al.,
1979). As a result, the size of particles is not fixed and can change
depending on the rate of coagulation and sedimentation. CARMA has 21
different size bins each with different optical properties, such that
changing aerosol sizes also changes the amount of extinction and
absorption of radiation. This is the same climate model used by Mills et
al. (2014), but their simulation kept the particle size of the soot
particles fixed at an effective radius of 0.05 μm. Fractal particles
using CARMA have a monomer size of 0.03 μm with a fractal dimension
varying between 1.5 and 3.0. Hygroscopic growth is not included, but
particle coagulation is a function of relative humidity. Despite major
improvements in our ability to simulate the evolution of soot particles
through time in the stratosphere, photochemical processing and
heterogeneous ozone chemistry on the surfaces of the soot aerosols are
not represented. The aerosols themselves do not affect the photolysis
rates of gas phase chemicals, similar to the models used in Mills et al.
(2014) and Pausata et al. (2016). This affects our ability to report on
changes in stratospheric ozone, and inclusion of these processes could
potentially shorten the residence time of soot particles in the
stratosphere.

Robock, Oman, and Stenchikov (2007) reported simulations of a similar
war scenario with the GISS ModelE. GISS ModelE is an Earth system model,
which was run with a spatial resolution of 4° × 5° (lat-lon), with 23
vertical layers and a model top of 80 km (Schmidt et al., 2006). ModelE
included a module to calculate transport and removal of aerosol
particles (Koch et al., 2006). At the time, ModelE used a bulk
stratospheric aerosol model, without the aerosol microphysics
incorporated in WACCM4, where mass extinction and single-scattering
albedo were prescribed and sedimentation is a function of particle size.
Soot in ModelE was assigned a constant unimodal radius of 0.1 μm, far
different from the fractal particles in WACCM4. In ModelE it was assumed
that soot could not be removed by rainfall for the first 24 hr, while in
WACCM4 soot could immediately be washed out, such that in Mills et al.
(2014), 28% of soot was removed before it could be lofted into the
stratosphere. Three ModelE ensembles run for 10 years each with no black
carbon burden were used as a climatology to compare with the
perturbation case, which simulated the 10 years following the injection
of soot over the United States and Russia.

As was done in previous model simulations of other nuclear war scenarios
(Mills et al., 2008; Mills et al., 2014; Robock, Oman, Stenchikov, Toon,
et al., 2007; Stenke et al., 2013), soot is represented as pure black
carbon in WACCM4. Extinction per unit mass by soot is computed from the
particle size assuming a fractal shape, and a refractive index of
1.8--0.67i, following the approach of Wolf and Toon (2010) and Bardeen
et al. (2017). Consequently, the average optical properties vary
throughout the simulation as the proportion of black carbon in each bin
changes. [[The mass extinction coefficient for black
carbon]{.underline}]{.mark} (for light within the 533-nm centered
wavelength band, averaged across all particle sizes) [varies between 9.6
and 9.8 m2/g]{.underline} in WACCM4. In an attempt to account for dust
and organic carbon, Robock, Oman, and Stenchikov (2007) reduced the mass
extinction coefficient of black carbon to [[5.5 m2/g for all visible
light]{.underline}]{.mark} in their 150-Tg case. ModelE also assumed a
constant particle size, a constant mass absorption coefficient of 2.0
m2/g, and a single-scattering albedo of 0.64. However, most nuclear war
soot injection estimates and simulations used pure black carbon,
assuming that neither dust nor organic carbon would reduce the soot\'s
ability to absorb radiation, while also neglecting their impact on
particle size (Bond & Bergstrom, 2006; Toon et al., 2007). In contrast
to ModelE, we inject 150 Tg of pure black carbon in WACCM4, where the
mass extinction coefficient for particles with an effective radius of
0.1 μm at wavelengths of light at 533 nm is approximately 7 m2/g. Not
using the exact same optical properties of black carbon in WACCM4 as in
ModelE sacrifices some direct comparability between the models, but it
follows more closely the approach of other model simulations of mass
fires as a result of nuclear war. Estimates of smoke emissions by Toon
et al. (2008) and others are only for the soot component of the smoke
assuming that any organics produced would be oxidized rapidly in the
stratosphere. Consideration of composition other than pure black carbon
in the smoke would require increasing the mass of smoke emitted in
addition to changing the optical properties. Additionally, our model is
not yet able to allow the ratio of black and organic carbon in fractal
particles to evolve through time, which would be necessary to account
for organic carbon properly. Toon et al. (2008) estimated that 180 Tg of
black carbon alone could be injected into the atmosphere in the war
scenario used here and in ModelE, where urban areas are targeted using
4,400 total nuclear weapons with 100-kt yield from the Russian and
United States arsenals (Toon et al., 2008). The United States and Russia
each have close to 4,000 strategic weapons deployed or in storage, and
the average yield is larger than 100 kt according to recent estimates
(Kristensen & Norris, 2018a, 2018b). The approach by Robock, Oman, and
Stenchikov (2007) effectively reduced the total black carbon injected
below 150 Tg, which is no longer consistent with estimates of this war
scenario (Toon et al., 2007). If Robock, Oman, and Stenchikov (2007) had
wanted to consider organic or dust emissions, then the total emissions
should have been increased along with changing the optical properties.
Here we just consider the black carbon injection of 150 Tg, which is
consistent with the emission estimates for this war scenario. We ran
three ensembles of WACCM4 for 20 years each with no black carbon burden
to use as a climatology to compare with a soot injection case.

The black carbon is injected into the upper troposphere (300--150 hPa)
at a rate that is linearly decreasing over a 1-week period starting on
15 May and is spread uniformly over the same areas of Russia and the
United States as in ModelE. We retain this simplified approach, while in
reality, soot injections would initially be focused only over areas
targeted but over days to weeks would likely spread out similar to our
initial injection. The year of the injection will be referred to as Year
0, which, in agreement with GISS ModelE, is the year 2000. WACCM4 was
run for 20 years following this perturbation, and additional ensemble
member simulations were not conducted because the magnitude of the
forcing is far greater than natural variations on a global scale. Even
for a 5-Tg soot injection, the signal dominates over natural variability
(Mills et al., 2014). CO2 was kept constant.

global catastrophic and existential risk (x-risks) prevention and policy
efforts are happening in the **West**]{.underline}, especially in US, UK
and Sweden. Even the best policies adopted by the governments of these
countries may not help if a catastrophe occurs in another country or
countries.

This newsletter will help to inform the Western public of activity
relative to x-risks in Russia. All information presented here is based
on open sources. However, these sources require some systematisation and
debiasing. For example, some Russian news sources tend to present
situation as worse than they are just to attract attention. Another
source of biases is the ongoing new cold war.

This is the first test issue of the newsletter, which I will issue every
3 months. I will publish it on LessWrong, the existential risk subreddit
and existential risk Facebook page. I do not currently have a
subscription option available. Below are news for summer 2019:

1\. "Planetary catastrophe" was prevented after a fire aboard the
deepwater nuclear submarine Losharick "by the dead heroes" on its crew,
as was said during the funeral for the victims. Most likely, this was
just rhetoric. However, a more ominous but less probable interpretation
is that the catastrophe was somehow connected with the Poseidon nuclear
torpedo, which is said to be capable of carrying a 100 megaton
cobalt-salted bomb (still not a planetary catastrophe, even if it
explodes in a harbour, but surely a regional one). This is, however,
unlikely, as Losharik is a small submarine, incapable of carrying such a
large system.

2\. Russia's biggest state-owned bank, Sberbank, said that AI could be
the last invention of humanity. Sberbank chairman German Gref is known
for his technoprogressivist views; as well as one of the main investors
in AI development; the bank invited Bostrom to its conference. While
these views are not an official position of the Russian government, the
government does own a large stake in the bank, and recently developed
plans that AI will be developed in Russia by large, government-owned
companies, including Sberbank. One 30 May 2019, Putin held a meeting
about national AI strategy, and Gref was the first who spoke. Putin
reiterated that anyone who has a monopoly on AI will be the ruler of the
world. The plan is to increase the share of companies that are using AI;
to create an AI capable of solving more wider tasks; to create a Russian
AI chip; and to reach the top 10 list of countries in terms of citations
of scientific research about AI. However, the allocated budget is rather
small---1.5 bln USD for 6 years---much less than is allocated for
national AI strategies in other countries. It should also be noted that
what Putin says doesn't automatically becomes reality: he used to say a
lot about democracy, wage increases, etc., while actual disposable
income is constantly declining.

3\. Putin warned against wind energy, as he claimed it could kill worms
in the ground: He said: "Will people be comfortable living on a planet
lined with a picket fence of windmills and covered with several layers
of solar panels? How many birds die due to windmills! They shake so much
that worms crawl out of the ground". The claim about birds may have some
merit, but the claim about worms is obviously false and intended to mock
environmentalists. Despite this, grassroots environmental awareness is
growing in Russia, especially connected with illegal dumps, one of which
almost led to a plane crash on the 8th of August. An illegal dump near
an airport attracted birds, which were sucked into both engines of an
Airbus; it miraculously landed on a field nearby. Personally, I was
going to fly this airplane on the same route that day, but in the
opposite direction, so I saw on arrival the bags of people that had been
removed from the crash-landed plane (nobody died, but there were
injuries).

4\. [Russian]{.underline} [**[forest fires]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[were]{.underline} claimed to be [a]{.underline} **[planetary
catastrophe]{.underline}** (before the Amazonian ones came to overshadow
those in Siberia in the news). The official area of the fire is around
30 000 km, but could be larger. They are probably [connected

**[Permafrost]{.underline}**, defined as ground that remains at or below
0 °C for 2 or more consecutive years, [has become **vulnerable to
widespread thaw**]{.underline} in response to rapid climate warming at
high latitudes. Permafrost temperatures have increased over the last 30
years (Romanovsky et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2010; Calvin et al.,
2023), resulting in the thickening of the active layer, which is the
uppermost, seasonally thawed layer (Harris et al., 1988; Bonnaventure
and Lamoureux, 2013). [Widespread permafrost thaw and **increases** in
**active layer thickness** are expected under future climate
conditions]{.underline} (Smith and Burgess, 2004; Zhang et al., 2008;
Derksen et al., 2019; Peng et al., 2023), and these processes are
[expected to **release large amounts of soil carbon to the atmosphere as
greenhouse gas emissions**]{.underline} (Schaefer et al., 2014; Gasser
et al., 2018; Knoblauch et al., 2018; Yokohata et al., 2020; Natali et
al., 2021; Schuur et al., 2022; See et al., 2024). Changes to
permafrost, particularly near-surface permafrost and the active layer,
have important implications for ecology, forestry, hydrology,
biogeochemistry, climate feedbacks, engineering, traditional
livelihoods, and community safety (Anisimov and Reneva, 2006; O\'Donnell
et al., 2011b; Rocha and Shaver, 2011; Bret-Harte et al., 2013; Hugelius
et al., 2014; Jones et al., 2015; Li et al., 2019; Turetsky et al.,
2020; Gibson et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2024).

Climate change is also intensifying high-latitude wildfire regimes
(Kasischke et al., 2010; de Groot et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2015;
Wotton et al., 2017; Hanes et al., 2019; McCarty et al., 2021; Descals
et al., 2022; Phillips et al., 2022; Scholten et al., 2022; Zheng et
al., 2023; Byrne et al., 2024). [**Wildfire activity shows** interannual
variability that is predominantly controlled by subseasonal drying and
climate, where **prolonged warm and dry conditions in conjunction with
fuel accumulation** may alter fire regimes and the seasonality of
fire]{.underline} (York et al., 2020). The [interaction between wildfire
and permafrost results in]{.underline} [both immediate and long-term
effects on the surface energy balance and ground thermal regimes, as
well as hydrologic cycling and soil and aquatic
biogeochemistry]{.underline} (O\'Donnell et al., 2011b; Rocha and
Shaver, 2011; Bret-Harte et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2015; Li et al.,
2019; Hollingsworth et al., 2020; Holloway et al., 2020). These
interactions also result in [second-order greenhouse gas
emissions]{.underline} (O\'Donnell et al., 2011c; Jiang et al., 2015;
Smith et al., 2015; Jones et al., 2015; Gibson et al., 2018; Li et al.,
2019) by making stored soil carbon available for mineralization
(O\'Donnell et al., 2011c; Rocha and Shaver, 2011; Bret-Harte et al.,
2013; Hugelius et al., 2014; Jones et al., 2015; Li et al., 2019).
Biomass combustion during fires [removes the insulating surface
vegetation]{.underline} (i.e., moss, lichen, low-growing shrubs) and
[soil organic matter, typically reduces]{.underline} evapotranspiration
(Rouse, 1976; Amiro, 2001; Chambers and Chapin, 2002; Chambers et al.,
2005; Amiro et al., 2006; Chebykina et al., 2022; Fedorov, 2022), and
reduces short-term [albedo during the thaw season, r**esulting in
increases in the ground heat flux and the expansion of the active
layer**]{.underline} (Moskalenko, 1999; Rocha et al., 2012; Jafarov et
al., 2013; Nossov et al., 2013; Jiang et al., 2015; Douglas et al.,
2016; Fisher et al., 2016; Gibson et al., 2018). [Similarly**, tree
canopy removal reduces shading in the summer and results in more snow on
the ground in the winter**]{.underline}, both leading to higher surface
soil temperatures and expansion of the active layer into near-surface
permafrost, which has been shown across North America (Rocha et al.,
2012; Jafarov et al., 2013; Jiang et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015;
Douglas et al., 2016; Fisher et al., 2016; Gibson et al., 2018) and
Eurasia (Moskalenko, 1999; Lytkina, 2008; Kirdyanov et al., 2020; Heim
et al., 2021; Fedorov, 2022; Petrov et al., 2022). In contrast, across
North American Arctic tundra, [**shrub removal from wildfire** results
in **thinner snow** due to increased wind exposure, which causes a
**reduction of the active layer**]{.underline} (Wang et al., 2012; Jones
et al., 2024), while Russian scientists note an expansion of the
seasonal active layer that is dependent on vegetation communities
(Moskalenko, 1999; Lytkina, 2008).

Post-[fire changes in the energy balance and subsequent increases in the
**active layer thickness have historically recovered to pre-fire
conditions** as vegetation succession occurred]{.underline} (Rouse,
1976; Amiro, 2001; Liu et al., 2005; Amiro et al., 2006), with a maximum
active layer thickness **[often observed 5--10 years
post-fire]{.underline}** (Rocha et al., 2012; Holloway et al., 2020),
[**but** this **may extend up to 30 or more years
post-fire**]{.underline} (Gibson et al., 2018; Kirdyanov et al., 2020;
Heim et al., 2021). However, this pattern of [recovery may be **changing
alongside climate warming and shifting fire regimes**]{.underline}
(Brown et al., 2015), and it may be further impacted by secondary
disturbances (Hayes and Buma, 2021). For example, as wildfire burns
across permafrost peatlands, there is not only a thicker and warmer
active layer but also an expansion of year-round unfrozen ground (i.e.,
taliks) and thermokarst bogs (Gibson et al., 2018). These changes in
active layer thickness and hydrologic dynamics can constrain
regeneration by prolonging vegetation recovery and inducing shifts in
vegetation composition and structure (Baltzer et al., 2014; Dearborn et
al., 2021). Further, near-surface permafrost degradation can lead to
ground subsidence, which alters surface hydrology, often leading to
water inundation and further degradation (Brown et al., 2015). Where
wildfires burn across permafrost landforms (e.g., thermokarst, ice-rich
areas), deep and irreversible thawing could permanently alter the
landscape (Burn and Lewkowicz, 1990; Lewkowicz, 2007; Sannel and Kuhry,
2011; Liljedahl et al., 2016; Rudy et al., 2017; Borge et al., 2017;
Mamet et al., 2017; Fraser et al., 2018), releasing long-stored soil
carbon into the atmosphere (Schuur et al., 2015). Currently, emissions
from fire-induced permafrost thaw are underestimated by the scientific
community and climate models (Natali et al., 2021; Treharne et al.,
2022; Schädel et al., 2024), an issue that is exacerbated by modeling
challenges and uncertainties associated with permafrost carbon stocks
(Hugelius et al., 2014; Turetsky et al., 2020). The change in active
layer thickness over time is a critical diagnostic indicator of
permafrost conditions (Brown et al., 2000; Shiklomanov et al., 2010) and
a vital component of modeling carbon emissions from fire- and
non-fire-related permafrost thaw.

#### Permafrost melting can cause the release of several harmful pollutants, including nuclear waste, chemicals, and biohazards

[[Global warming is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[causing the thawing of
permafrost]{.underline}]{.mark}---ground that remains frozen for two or
more consecutive years. It is found at high latitudes and high
altitudes, mainly in Siberia, the Tibetan Plateau, Alaska, Northern
Canada, Greenland, parts of Scandinavia and Russia. Permafrost, some of
which has been frozen for tens or hundreds of thousands of years, stores
the carbon-based remains of plants and animals that froze before they
could decompose. Scientists estimate that the world's [[permafrost holds
1,500 billion tons of carbon,]{.mark} almost [double the amount of
carbon]{.mark} currently [in the atmosphere]{.mark}]{.underline}. As
permafrost thaws, the microbes within consume the frozen organic matter
and release carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. [[This
accelerates warming,]{.mark} precipitating even more permafrost thaw [in
an irreversible cycle]{.mark}]{.underline}. Scientists project that
two-thirds of the Arctic's near-surface permafrost could be gone by
2100.

When the ice in permafrost melts, the ground becomes unstable and can
slump, causing rock and landslides, floods, and coastal erosion. The
buckling earth can damage buildings, roads, power lines, and other
infrastructure. It is affecting many Indigenous communities that have
lived and depended on the stability of frozen permafrost for hundreds of
years.

What lies under thawing permafrost?

Microbes

[As permafrost thaws, [bacteria and viruses that have been hidden
underground]{.mark} for tens of thousands of years [are being
uncovered.]{.mark} One gram of permafrost was found to harbor thousands
of dormant microbe species.]{.underline} Some of these species could be
new viruses or ancient ones for which humans lack immunity and cures, or
diseases that society has eliminated, such as smallpox or Bubonic
plague. [In 2016, [a hundred people in Siberia were hospitalized and a
boy died after contracting anthrax from an infected reindeer
carcass]{.mark} that had frozen 75 years earlier and become exposed when
the permafrost thawed. Anthrax spores entered the soil and water, and
eventually the food supply.]{.underline}

Much [[older specimens have also been uncovered]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Scientists have revived a 30,000-year-old virus that infects amoebas and
discovered microbes more than 400,000 years old. [[Some of these
microorganisms may already be resistant to our
antibiotics.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Pollutants

[Because [the Arctic]{.mark} has been covered by ice and permafrost for
much of human history and was largely inaccessible, it [was an ideal
place to dump chemicals, biohazards, and even radioactive
materials]{.mark}]{.underline}. The risks these materials pose in the
light of thawing permafrost are poorly understood.

[Radioactive waste from nuclear reactors and submarines, nuclear
testing, and [dumped nuclear waste can be exposed by melting ice and
thawing permafrost]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Chemicals]{.underline}
]{.mark}[and pollutants, [such as DDT and PCBs, that]{.mark} were
transported through the atmosphere and [frozen in the permafrost, may
also resurface. Heavy metal mine waste]{.mark} resulting from decades of
extensive mining [in the Arctic is found in permafrost as
well.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The [increased water flow]{.mark} resulting [from thawing permafrost
will enable pollutants and microorganisms to spread]{.mark} more
[easily,]{.mark} with potential [risks to ecosystems, local communities,
and]{.mark} the [food chain. The increase in cruise ships, tourism,
mining, and commerce in the Arctic could also expose more people to
pathogens and pollutants]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Is there anything positive about melting glaciers and thawing
permafrost?

[There are [many disasters that could result from melting glaciers and
thawing permafrost,]{.mark}]{.underline} but there may also be a few
potential benefits.

One study found that the new shipping routes opened by melting ice in
the Arctic could reduce the travel time between Asia and Europe
substantially. The Arctic routes are 30 to 50 percent shorter than the
Suez Canal and Panama Canal routes and can cut travel time by 14 to 20
days. Ships will thus be able to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions
by 24 percent, while saving money on fuel and ship wear and tear.

New mining opportunities in previously inaccessible areas and in the
deep sea will make it possible to obtain the quantities of rare and
precious metals needed to transition to a clean energy economy. The
chairman of the Metals Company said, "The reality is that the
clean-energy transition is not possible without taking billions of tons
of metal from the planet."

The microbes and viruses that have lived in the permafrost for millennia
had to develop many adaptations to withstand the harsh environment and
may help to develop new antibiotics. To survive, bacteria competed with
each other by producing antibiotics, some of which may be entirely new.
While [[some microbes have been found to be **antibiotic
resistant**]{.underline}]{.mark}, others might be able to help develop
new antibiotics for medical use. In Arctic soil uncovered by thawing
permafrost, scientists discovered new bacteriophages---bacteria
eaters---each one of which consumes a different bacterium.

Researchers found one bacterium that could survive in cold and
biodegrade oil in contaminated Arctic soil; the bacterium was able to
take up 60 percent of the oil around it. This could potentially help
clean up oil spills in the Arctic. Two other bacteria species recovered
from thawing permafrost were found to degrade dioxins and furans,
volatile liquids, which could aid in remediating contaminated sites. One
researcher is studying whether organisms in permafrost can produce
enzymes that break down plastics.

The melting ice and thawing permafrost have also revealed geography and
ancient artifacts that are deepening archaeologists' understanding of
history and culture. In the mountains of Norway, melting ice revealed a
remote ancient mountain pass and artifacts from the Roman Iron Age and
the time of the Vikings. The pass was an important path for moving
livestock between grazing sites and a passageway for travel and trade.
Researchers also found numerous tools, artifacts, and weapons that had
belonged to the Vikings. In the Jotunheimen Mountain Range of Norway,
archaeologists discovered an iron arrowhead dating back to the Norwegian
Iron Age.

This year, when Antarctic sea ice cover hit a record low, researchers in
the Weddell Sea, a remote part of the Antarctic, were searching for the
wreckage of Sir Ernest Shackleton's ship, *Endurance*. It had been
trapped by the sea ice and sunk in 1915.

Photo: Endurance22

They were able to find the ship almost 9,900 feet underwater, due in
part to reduced ice cover.

In the thawing permafrost of the Yukon, scientists found a perfectly
preserved wolf pup that lived 57,000 years ago during the Ice Age, camel
bones from 75,000 to 125,000 years ago, and teeth from a hyena-like
creature that lived 850,000 to 1.4 million years ago. Because the
specimens are well-preserved and contain genetic material, they can help
scientists understand how species responded to climate change and human
impacts long ago.

As the planet warms, some countries and regions will lose out, while
others will benefit. For example, Siberia will likely become a huge
wheat producer, and Canada a major wine producer.

Greenland's economy currently relies on fishing, tourism, and hunting
but it will need to exploit its natural resources to support an aging
population. The sand and sediment released by Greenland's melting
glaciers could be worth more than \$1.11 billion because the world faces
a severe shortage of the sand needed to make concrete, computers, and
glass. While dredging sand and transporting it could cause environmental
damage, a clear majority of Greenlanders polled want their government to
explore the extraction and exportation of sand.

As Greenland's glaciers retreat, they also leave behind silt crushed
into nano-size particles by the weight of the ice. This nutrient-rich
mud, called glacial rock flour, gives plants more access to nutrients
such as potassium, calcium, and silicon, while absorbing CO2 from the
air. Adding 27.5 tons of glacial rock flour per hectare increased barley
yields in Denmark by 30 percent. Applying 1.1 tons of it to fields
absorbs between 250 and 300 kilograms of CO2. The more than one billion
tons of glacial rock flour deposited yearly on Greenland could enable
farmers to sell carbon credits because of the CO2 absorbed, and boost
the country's economy.

The changes raise complex questions

Ultimately, these relatively small potential benefits cannot outweigh
the enormous impacts climate change will have on local communities and
the planet. "Do I believe that these kinds of changes \[[mining and
shipping opportunities]{.underline}\] are translating into something
positive for the broader society on the planet? Absolutely not," said
Schaefer. "\[They\] [will further enrich an already incredibly rich tiny
minority of capitalists]{.underline}."

Eight countries claim territory in the Arctic: Canada, Denmark (because
Greenland was its former colony), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia,
Sweden, and the United States, some with overlapping geological claims.
As the region warms, and new opportunities for exploitation arise,
"near-Arctic" countries such as China, Japan, South Korea, Britain, and
EU members are becoming more focused on the region as well. Intelligence
analyst Rebekah Koffler has warned, "The Arctic is going to be the
future battlefield for economic dominance and possession of natural
resources."

It is a geological reality that as ice melts and permafrost thaws, many
surfaces will get exposed. Schaefer believes the best thing to do is to
tighten laws so that outsiders or wealthy private companies cannot
simply exploit resources without any responsibility to the planet or the
people who own the land.

The question of who will benefit from climate change impacts, and from
the melting and thawing regions in particular, is complicated. Schaefer
believes these issues are moving away from climate science and into law
and ethics, and that perhaps the best framework for resolving them is to
prioritize climate justice. He said, "The voices and votes of the people
who live there and own the land need to be at the center of everything."

climates, with the equatorial trade winds and mid-latitude westerlies.
It is refined and shaped by the global distribution of land masses that,
in the northern hemisphere, collect precipitation and direct it poleward
through massive rivers. These rivers introduce substantial amounts of
fresh water into the upper layers of the Arctic Ocean, providing the
required conditions for an ice cover to form, and regulating nutrient
supplies and biological productivity.

#### Permafrost melting can also cause the release of dangerous microbes, including "zombie viruses"

Scientists have revived a 'zombie' virus that spent 48,500 years frozen
in permafrost, Katie **Hunt**, Wed March 8, 20**23**, CNN World,
https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/08/world/permafrost-virus-risk-climate-scn

**[Warmer temperatures in the Arctic are thawing the region's
permafrost]{.underline}** --- a frozen layer of soil beneath the ground
--- **[and potentially stirring viruses that, after lying dormant for
tens of thousands of years, could endanger animal and human
health.]{.underline}** While a pandemic unleashed by a disease from the
distant past sounds like the plot of a sci-fi movie, scientists warn
that the risks, though low, are underappreciated. **[Chemical and
radioactive waste]{.underline}** that dates back to the Cold War, which
has the potential to harm wildlife and disrupt ecosystems, **[may also
be released during thaws]{.underline}**. "There's a lot going on with
the permafrost that is of concern, and (it) really shows why **[it's
super important that we keep as much of the permafrost frozen as
possible]{.underline}**," said Kimberley Miner, a climate scientist at
the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena, California. Permafrost covers a fifth of the
Northern Hemisphere, having underpinned the Arctic tundra and boreal
forests of Alaska, Canada and Russia for millennia. It serves as a kind
of time capsule, preserving --- in addition to ancient viruses --- the
mummified remains of a number of extinct animals that scientist have
been able to unearth

study in recent years, including two cave lion cubs and a woolly rhino.
The reason permafrost is a good storage medium isn't just because it's
cold; it's an oxygen-free environment that light doesn't penetrate.
**But [current day Arctic temperatures are warming up to four times
faster than the rest of the planet]{.underline}**, weakening the top
layer of permafrost in the region. To better understand the risks posed
by frozen viruses, Jean-Michel Claverie, an Emeritus professor of
medicine and genomics at the Aix-Marseille University School of Medicine
in Marseille, France, has tested earth samples taken from Siberian
permafrost to see whether any viral particles contained therein are
still infectious. He's in search of what he describes as "zombie
viruses" --- and he has found some. Jean-Michel Claverie is pictured
here working in the subsampling room at the Alfred Wegener Institute in
Postsdam, where the cores of permafrost were kept. Jean-Michel Claverie
The virus hunter Claverie studies a particular type of virus he first
discovered in 2003. Known as giant viruses, they are much bigger than
the typical variety and visible under a regular light microscope, rather
than a more powerful electron microscope --- which makes them a good
model for this type of lab work. His efforts to detect viruses frozen in
permafrost were partly inspired by a team of Russian scientists who in
2012 revived a wildflower from a 30,000-year-old seed tissue found in a
squirrel's burrow. (Since then, scientists have also successfully
brought ancient microscopic animals back to life.) Top of Form

In 2014, he managed to revive a virus he and his team isolated from the
permafrost, making it infectious for the first time in 30,000 years by
inserting it into cultured cells. For safety, he'd chosen to study a
virus that could only target single-celled amoebas, not animals or
humans. He repeated the feat in 2015, isolating a different virus type
that also targeted amoebas. And in his latest research, published
February 18 in the journal Viruses, Claverie and his team isolated
several strains of ancient virus from multiple samples of permafrost
taken from seven different places across Siberia and showed they could
each infect cultured amoeba cells. This is a computer-enhanced
microphoto of Pithovirus sibericum that was isolated from a
30,000-year-old sample of permafrost in 2014. Jean-Michel
Claverie/IGS/CNRS-AMU Those latest strains represent five new families
of viruses, on top of the two he had revived previously. The oldest was
almost 48,500 years old, based on radiocarbon dating of the soil, and
came from a sample of earth taken from an underground lake 16 meters (52
feet) below the surface. The youngest samples, found in the stomach
contents and coat of a woolly mammoth's remains, were 27,000 years old.
That amoeba-infecting viruses are still infectious after so long is
indicative of a potentially bigger problem, Claverie said. He fears
[people **regard his research as a scientific curiosity and don't
perceive the prospect of ancient viruses coming back to life as a
serious public health threat**]{.underline}. "We view these
amoeba-infecting viruses as surrogates for all other possible viruses
that might be in the permafrost," Claverie told CNN. "**[We see the
traces of many, many, many other viruses]{.underline}**," he added. "So
we know they are there. We don't know for sure that they are still
alive. But our reasoning is that **[if the amoeba viruses are still
alive, there is no reason why the other viruses will not be still
alive]{.underline}**, and capable of infecting their own hosts**[."
Precedent for human infection Traces of viruses and bacteria that can
infect humans have been found preserved in permafrost.]{.underline}** A
lung sample from a woman's body exhumed in 1997 from permafrost in a
village on the Seward Peninsula of Alaska contained genomic material
from the influenza strain responsible for the 1918 pandemic. In 2012,
scientists confirmed the 300-year-old mummified remains of a woman
buried in Siberia contained the genetic signatures of the virus that
causes smallpox. An anthrax outbreak in Siberia that affected dozens of
humans and more than 2,000 reindeer between July and August in 2016 has
also been linked to the deeper thawing of the permafrost during
exceptionally hot summers, allowing old spores of Bacillus anthracis to
resurface from old burial grounds or animal carcasses. Birgitta
Evengård, professor emerita at Umea University's Department of Clinical
Microbiology in Sweden, said **[there should be better surveillance of
the risk posed by potential pathogens in thawing
permafrost]{.underline}**, but warned against an alarmist approach. "You
must remember our immune defense has been developed in close contact
with microbiological surroundings," said Evengård, who is part of the
CLINF Nordic Centre of Excellence, a group that investigates the effects
of climate change on the prevalence of infectious diseases in humans and
animals in northern regions. "If there is a virus hidden in the
permafrost that we have not been in contact with for thousands of years,
it might be that our immune defense is not sufficient," she said. "It is
correct to have respect for the situation and be proactive and not just
reactive. And the way to fight fear is to have knowledge." A boat served
as a canteen and storage space for the team that took cores that
Claverie used in his experiments. Jean-Michel Claverie/IGS/CNRS-AM
Chances of viral spillover Of course, in the real world, scientists
don't know how long these viruses could remain infectious once exposed
to present-day conditions, or how likely the virus would be to encounter
a suitable host. Not all viruses are pathogens that can cause disease;
some are benign or even beneficial to their hosts. And while it is home
to 3.6 million people, the Arctic is still a sparsely populated place,
making the risk of human exposure to ancient viruses very low. Still,
"the risk is bound to increase in the context of global warming,"
Claverie said, "in which permafrost thawing will keep accelerating, and
more people will populate the Arctic in the wake of industrial
ventures." And Claverie isn't alone in warning that the region could
become a fertile ground for a spillover event --- when a virus jumps
into a new host and starts to spread. Last year, a team of scientists
published research on samples of soil and lake sediment taken from Lake
Hazen, a freshwater lake in Canada located within the Arctic circle.
They sequenced the genetic material in the sediment to identify viral
signatures and the genomes of potential hosts --- plants and animals ---
in the area. Using a computer model analysis, they suggested the risk of
viruses spilling over to new hosts was higher at locations close to
where large amounts of glacial meltwater flowed into the lake --- a
scenario that becomes more likely as the climate warms. Cores of
permafrost samples are pictured in a container. Jean-Michel
Claverie/IGS/CNRS-AM Unknown consequences Identifying viruses and other
hazards contained in the warming permafrost is the first step in
understanding what risk they pose to the Arctic, Miner at NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory said. Other challenges include quantifying where,
when, how fast and how deep permafrost will thaw. Thawing can be a
gradual process of as little as centimeters per decade, but also happens
more rapidly, such as in the case of massive land slumps that can
suddenly expose deep and ancient layers of permafrost[. **The process
also releases methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere --- an
overlooked and underestimated driver of climate
change**]{.underline}**.** Permafrost thaw can be gradual or happen much
more quickly. Jean-Michel Claverie/IGS/CNRS-AM Miner cataloged an array
of potential hazards currently frozen in Arctic permafrost in a 2021
paper published in the scientific journal Nature Climate Change. Those
**[possible dangers included buried waste from the mining of heavy
metals and chemicals such as the pesticide DDT, which was banned in the
early 2000s. Radioactive material has also been dumped in the Arctic ---
by Russia and the United States --- since the advent of nuclear testing
in the 1950s]{.underline}**. "Abrupt thaw rapidly exposes old permafrost
horizons, releasing compounds and microorganisms sequestered in deeper
layers," Miner and other researchers noted in the 2021
paper[.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01162-y) In the
research paper, Miner labeled the direct infection of humans with
ancient pathogens released from permafrost as "currently improbable."
However, Miner said she is worried about what she termed "Methuselah
microorganisms" (named after the Biblical figure with the longest life
span). These are organisms that could bring the dynamics of ancient and
extinct ecosystems into the present-day Arctic, with unknown
consequences. The re-emergence of ancient microorganisms has the
potential to change soil composition and vegetative growth, possibly
further accelerating the effects of climate change, Miner said. "We're
really unclear as to how these microbes are going to interact with the
modern environment," she said. "It's not really an experiment that I
think any of us want to run." The best course of action, Miner said, is
to try and halt the thaw, and the wider climate crisis, and keep these
hazards entombed in the permafrost for good.

The zombie virus infection is spread by biting into contaminated tissue
through broken skin and transplantation to human beings. Other
similarities include the rabies virus, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, CMV,
herpes virus, and HIV. [Thirteen new pathogens, called zombie viruses,
remained infectious after millennia of freezing. The virus emerged as a
result of permafrost thawing]{.underline}. The new strain has one of 13
viral genomes. *Pandoravirus yedoma*, 48,500 years old, is the longest
frozen virus to become infectious. It is older than the 30,000-year-old
virus identified in Siberia in 2013 \[3,4\].

It is unknown how long these viruses will remain infectious if exposed
to outside environments and whether they will find a host in the
interim. **[The risk will increase when the permafrost thaws and more
people migrate to the Arctic due to industrialisation]{.underline}**.
One-quarter of the Northern Hemisphere is permanently frozen, known as
permafrost. Permafrost releases organic material, million-year-old ice,
which breaks down into carbon dioxide and methane, increasing the
greenhouse effect. Resurrected prokaryotes, unicellular eukaryotes, and
viruses from prehistoric times are examples of organic matter. Potential
Impact: [After researching living cultures, it was discovered that all
"**zombie viruses**" may propagate, making them a "**health danger**."
As long-dormant viruses such as the microbial Captain America are
liberated by melting permafrost, **pandemics are expected to become more
common**. Scientists fear that "resurgent" viruses and other
**microorganisms released in the future when permafrost melts could pose
a risk to people**]{.underline}. Greenpeace has expressed concern that
"[resurrected" pathogens could spark a pandemic]{.underline}. The
discoveries are reminiscent of the 1993 blockbuster Jurassic Park, in
which scientists used DNA from insects encased in amber to clone
dinosaurs. The permafrost, which covers about a quarter of the Northern
Hemisphere, is thawing as the climate warms. Other research institutions
focus on diseases such as germs and larger organisms. [Last year,
researchers discovered 15,000-year-old viruses under a Tibetan ice cap.
Microscopic nematode worms were recovered in 2018 from frozen Siberian
soil samples for 42,000 years.]{.underline} The researchers were clear:
The animals that moved and ate after being housed at 20 °C in
nutrient-rich Petri dishes were not contaminated samples. Birgitta
Evengard of Sweden\'s Umea University is concerned about permafrost
illness. Prof. Evengard assisted in the planning of a 2019 meeting on
the global health security threats posed by Arctic microorganisms. She
went on to say that it was impossible to anticipate whether
microorganisms found in thawing permafrost would harm people. "It is
Pandora\'s box; they might be human infections," she explained. "There
will be environmental consequences." Three rivers in Siberia discharge
permafrost material into the Bering Sea, causing chaotic ocean currents.
They travel the world in two weeks. [All ecosystems, oceans, land and
air---are inextricably linked]{.underline}. Prof. Evengard found it
concerning that the Arctic has warmed four times faster than the rest of
the world since 1979. "What happens in the Arctic impacts
everywhere \[4\]\".

She stated that scientists must access Siberia to investigate what is
happening. [**Thawing permafrost threatens to** exacerbate climate
change and **introduce viruses into the ecosystem**]{.underline}. These
microbes consume organic matter in the soil when it thaws, emitting
carbon dioxide and methane. [Zombie viruses can slumber on ice for years
before resurfacing when the ice melts. Researchers unfroze a latent
amoeba virus that has evolved into a zombie virus after 48,500 years.
Glaciers and permafrost are melting quickly as global warming becomes a
significant issue, releasing microorganisms that have been frozen for
years. **Melted ice has awakened zombie viruses that had been dormant
for years due to being imprisoned in ice.** Researchers successfully
unfroze a 48,500-year-old latent amoeba virus.]{.underline} [According
to studies, ancient frozen viruses that resurface after years can
endanger public health. **Every type of zombie virus poses a massive
threat because it can infect a human being and result in a fatal
infection.**]{.underline} The zombie virus was found alongside wolf
organs and mammoth wool by researchers. [One-fourth of the landmass in
the Northern Hemisphere is covered in permafrost, which is home to
viruses and bacteria that have been frozen solid. The permafrost
permanently thaws, releasing frozen biological material]{.underline}.
Organic matter decomposes, releasing methane and carbon dioxide into the
atmosphere \[5\].

Symptoms and epidemiology of emerging infectious zombies are based on
real diseases. We refer to the zombie tale phenomenon as "growing
infectious types of literature," which is analogous to "emerging
infectious diseases." Some of the most recent viral works of literature
are horrific, while others are science fiction or thrillers. The
transmission and pathogenicity rates of influenza have been used to
construct post-apocalyptic scenarios. [After researching live cultures,
specialists concluded that all "**Zombie viruses" are communicable and
pose a "health risk**\"]{.underline}.

The devastating impact of [[COVID]{.underline}]{.mark}-19 has
[highlighted global vulnerabilities to high-consequence biological
events]{.underline}. The international community was woefully unprepared
for [a pandemic]{.underline} that has [[led to millions of deaths and
trillions]{.underline}]{.mark} of dollars [[in]{.mark} economic
[losses]{.mark}]{.underline}, and has upended daily life. However,
notwithstanding the severe damage caused by
[[COVID]{.underline}-]{.mark}19, it [[should be viewed as a **warning
shot**]{.underline}]{.mark}.1 It will not be the last pandemic humanity
faces, and [[the next]{.underline}]{.mark} high-consequence [[biological
event could be]{.underline}]{.mark} as destructive or [[substantially
worse]{.underline}]{.mark}.

We define [[global catastrophic biological risks]{.underline}]{.mark}
(GCBRs) as biological events of tremendous scale that [[could cause
**severe damage to human civilization**]{.underline}]{.mark},
potentially [[jeopardizing]{.mark} its]{.underline} long-term
**[[survival]{.underline}]{.mark}**.2 The Johns Hopkins Center for
Health Security has also developed a working definition of GCBRs,3 and
this term is part of a broader discussion about global catastrophic
risks that could arise from a variety of sources, including nuclear war,
anthropogenic climate change, and advanced artificial intelligence that
has not been sufficiently safeguarded.4,5 [[GCBRs could be caused
by]{.mark} a naturally emerging [infectious disease]{.mark} outbreak,
[an accidental release of a pathogen, or a deliberate
attack]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Naturally emerging infectious disease
outbreaks that can grow into [pandemics are likely to increase in
frequency due to urbanization, globalization, and environmental
degradation]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and the world faces an increasing
risk of high-consequence biological events resulting from accidental or
deliberate misuse of]{.underline} the tools of modern bioscience and
[biotechnology]{.underline}.6-8 Not all outbreaks or global pandemics
will grow to the scale of a GCBR as we define it in this article and as
others have defined global catastrophic risks more broadly, because the
threshold for this type of event is extremely high.

[Although COVID-19 does not rise to the level of a GCBR-scale event, it
has demonstrated that a biological event can have a devastating global
impact]{.underline}, and it should serve as a warning to global leaders
that the world needs much more robust protections against
high-consequence biological events that could emerge in the future and
be substantially worse.

In our view, human-caused biological events involving the accidental or
deliberate misuse of an engineered pathogen are more likely to lead to a
GCBR-scale event than a naturally emerging pandemic.9 [[Scientists have
the capacity to]{.mark} deliberately or inadvertently **[engineer
pathogens]{.mark}** [that are more virulent and transmissible]{.mark}
than what nature creates by chance]{.underline}, and the upper limit of
damage that could be caused by a human-engineered biological event is
unknown.10-12 [[Prevention, **early detection**, and **rapid response**
are]{.mark} all [crucial]{.mark} for guarding against GCBR-scale
events]{.underline}. However, in this article, we focus on effective
strategies for preventing biological events that could become GCBRs,
specifically by disincentivizing development and use of biological
weapons by states and other powerful actors.

[Fires in the Arctic]{.underline} region [are gaining]{.underline} more

location for all to access, incentivizing the gathering of new
information]{.underline} and production of lessons learned from shared
strategies. This would be analogous to the BAT/BAP (best available

climate model intercomparison assessments. [2. Develop a
Pan-Arctic]{.underline} and boreal [fuel load spatial data

(continuing into November), [with growing evidence of holdover fires,

[lengthening]{.underline} fire season to be able to develop appropriate
adaptation and intervention strategies for community preparation, as

integrated into earth system [models]{.underline} to [provide real-time
forecasts and climate records taking advantage of meteorological
variables, land surface modelling, and satellite
observations]{.underline}. Fuel load and moisture is partitioned into
live and dead fuels, including both wood and foliage components. As an
example, we have generated a 10-year dataset which is well correlated
with independent data and largely explains observed fire activity
globally. While dead fuel moisture correlates highest with fire
activity, live fuel moisture and load are shown to potentially enhance
prediction skill. [The use of observation data to inform a dynamical
model is a crucial first step toward disentangling the contributing

1 Introduction

Landscape fires have wide-ranging consequences for local ecosystems,
meteorology, regional air quality, and global atmospheric composition.
They occur across various environments, including forests, croplands,
and savannahs, where both living and dead vegetation act as fuel
sources**[. Fire behaviour, duration, emissions, and impact on the
landscape can vary based on fuel characteristics]{.underline}**. [Ground
fires, fuelled by organic-rich soil such as peat, are associated with
below-ground burning (Turetsky et al., 2015). Surface, ladder, and crown
fires, fuelled by vegetation at different levels (floor level,
mid-level, and canopy level, respectively), represent above-ground
burning.]{.underline} The [intensity of these fires is influenced by the
availability of fuel]{.underline} and its curing state. Consequently,
these characteristics have implications for emissions and the injection
height of aerosols and trace gases into the atmosphere. In addition,
they modify the fire impact on the landscape, affecting the albedo as
well as surface heat and moisture fluxes, which results in atmospheric
feedbacks. For example, given sufficient fire intensity and suitable
atmospheric conditions, pyroconvective clouds may form, a process which
is, in part, subject to fuel characteristics (Badlan et al., 2021). The
examination and quantification of wildfire impacts is relevant for Earth
system models (ESMs[). Integrating vegetation fires in ESMs presents
numerous challenges relating to the complexity of modelling the temporal
evolution of fire spread and the spatial representation of fuel
characteristics at a fine scale]{.underline} (\<10 km). Such resolutions
are not currently resolved by ESMs, either used for weather forecasting
(∼10 km) or climate simulations (∼100 km).

[To comprehensively model vegetation impact on wildfires several
variables must be considered. One such variable is fuel load, which is
the total mass of vegetation per unit area and provides the baseline of
biomass available.]{.underline} Fuel load can be further partitioned
between wood and foliage, both alive and dead. Fuel moisture content of
both live (LFMC) and dead (DFMC) vegetation is another key variable,
which modulates flammability (Yebra et al., 2013). [Both fuel load and
moisture content directly influence fire occurrence, intensity, and rate
of spread. Fuel moisture content is expressed as the proportion of water
relative to the total dry mass of vegetation. LFMC is controlled by
various ecophysiological traits and environmental factors affecting
transpiration, such as soil moisture and humidity (Castro et al., 2003).
DFMC is independent of transpiration and is determined by meteorological
factors, including precipitation, solar radiation, as well as fuel
composition and structure.]{.underline}

The global monitoring of fuel load and moisture content presents several
challeng[es. Globally, peat fire fuel is difficult to estimate and model
in near real time (NRT) given the measurement and process uncertainty
(Spawn et al., 2020). Remote sensing techniques can be utilized to
estimate the fuel load for above-ground fires]{.underline} (Xiao et al.,
2019), [although they are limited to sensor coverage in both time and
space. Alternatively, fuel can be estimated using land surface models
with dynamic vegetation]{.underline} (Thonicke et al., 2010), although
similar limitations apply as they are simulated at coarse resolution.
Concerning fuel moisture content, recent studies have shown the
potential of satellite-based observations in generating high-resolution
global LFMC products (Quan et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2021). Whilst these
results are promising, sparse daily coverage limits global NRT estimates
required to fully characterize fuel evolution. Satellite-based passive
microwave vegetation optical depth (VOD) retrievals can be used to
estimate LFMC content with NRT global coverage (Forkel et al., 2023);
however, these are provided at a coarse spatial resolution (∼0.25∘) and
are likely to be subject to noise from soil moisture and vegetation
type. Additionally, VOD provides an estimate of total moisture content,
which itself is dependent on total fuel load, further entangling the
signal. Modelling efforts to introduce LFMC estimates based on variables
such as soil moisture are in development across the community (Rabin et
al., 2017).

This paper presents a novel modelling framework that combines satellite
observations and numerical weather prediction simulations to infer fuel
load and fuel moisture content. The framework is integrated into the
operational system of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
Forecasts (ECMWF) and aims to provide real-time estimations of fuel
characteristics, enabling the assessment of landscape flammability
daily, or even subdaily (Fig. 1). The model represents an initial step
in categorizing above-ground fuel load and moisture, providing a
foundation for diagnosing landscape fire disturbance in an operational
weather forecasting system and to generate a long-term record of these
essential climate variables. The framework includes foliage and wood
fuel load, including both alive and dead components, as well as LFMC and
DFMC. [The output provides information on fuel evolution and fire
danger, acting as the first step toward developing a global
mid-complexity fire rate-of-spread model. Additionally, the model output
could be used for modelling other land surface processes, such as trace
gas fluxes or biochemical soil properties, with the future aim of
achieving full dynamical coupling of fires between the land surface and
atmosphere.]{.underline}

Post-[fire changes in the energy balance and subsequent increases in the
active layer thickness have historically recovered to pre-fire
conditions as vegetation succession occurred]{.underline} (Rouse, 1976;
Amiro, 2001; Liu et al., 2005; Amiro et al., 2006), with a maximum
active layer thickness [often observed 5--10 years
post-fire]{.underline} (Rocha et al., 2012; Holloway et al., 2020), [but
this may extend up to 30 or more years post-fire]{.underline} (Gibson et
al., 2018; Kirdyanov et al., 2020; Heim et al., 2021). However, this
pattern of [recovery may be changing alongside climate warming and
shifting fire regimes]{.underline} (Brown et al., 2015), and it may be
further impacted by secondary disturbances (Hayes and Buma, 2021). For
example, [as]{.underline} wildfire burns across permafrost peatlands,
there is not only a thicker and warmer active layer but also an
expansion of year-round unfrozen ground (i.e., taliks) and thermokarst
bogs (Gibson et al., 2018). These changes in active layer thickness and
hydrologic dynamics can constrain regeneration by prolonging vegetation
recovery [and inducing shifts in vegetation composition and
structure]{.underline} (Baltzer et al., 2014; Dearborn et al., 2021).
Further, [near-surface permafrost degradation can lead to ground
subsidence, which alters surface hydrology, often leading to water
inundation and further degradation]{.underline} (Brown et al., 2015).
Where wildfires burn across permafrost landforms (e.g., thermokarst,
ice-rich areas), [**deep and irreversible thawing** could permanently
alter the landscape]{.underline} (Burn and Lewkowicz, 1990; Lewkowicz,
2007; Sannel and Kuhry, 2011; Liljedahl et al., 2016; Rudy et al., 2017;
Borge et al., 2017; Mamet et al., 2017; Fraser et al., 2018),
**[releasing long-stored soil carbon into the atmosphere]{.underline}**
(Schuur et al., 2015). Currently[, **emissions** from fire-induced
permafrost thaw are **underestimated by** the scientific community and
**climate models**]{.underline} (Natali et al., 2021; Treharne et al.,
2022; Schädel et al., 2024), an issue that is [**exacerbated by modeling
challenges and uncertainties associated with permafrost** carbon
stocks]{.underline} (Hugelius et al., 2014; Turetsky et al., 2020). The
change in active layer thickness over time is a critical diagnostic
indicator of permafrost conditions (Brown et al., 2000; Shiklomanov et
al., 2010) and a vital component of modeling carbon emissions from fire-
and non-fire-related permafrost thaw.

To provide critical data that can be used for understanding and modeling
impacts of wildfire on permafrost, we compiled [a **dataset** of thaw
depth measurements from paired burned and unburned sites across the
northern high-latitude permafrost zone]{.underline}. This dataset is the
first of its kind to focus on paired burned and unburned sites
[**providing a circumpolar/boreal perspective**. Climate and ecosystem
conditions including drainage, vegetation, and soil characteristics
control near-surface permafrost **characteristics**, and thus in order
to detect an influence of wildfire it is **necessary to have
measurements either pre- and post-fire** or unburned control and nearby
burned sites with otherwise similar ecosystem properties]{.underline}.
Measuring ALT for paired unburned control and nearby burn sites is more
realistic due to the stochasticity of wildfire. Further, unburned
control sites provide a benchmark for understanding the impact of
wildfire in these dynamic systems. Thaw depth increases over the course
of the thawing season until it reaches its maximum depth, i.e., active
layer thickness (ALT). This means that early-season to mid-season
measurements do not capture the full depth of the thawed active layer.
As such, the variability in thawing season and measurement timing makes
it difficult to compare across space and time. Therefore, we
standardized thaw depths taken at different times throughout the thawing
season, which [resulted in an **estimated dataset** of ALT. Further,
capturing the maximum ALT **aids in establishing the full scope of
permafrost change because it is a critical indicator of thaw
dynamics**]{.underline}. Depending on the location ALT could occur
anywhere from August through November. The overarching goal is to
generate a synthesized dataset of ALT for burned--unburned pairs. To
achieve this, we had four main objectives for the paper: (1) describe
how the data were collected and synthesized for thaw depth measurements
of burned sites with paired unburned sites; (2) describe how we
standardized thaw depth measurements to end-of-season ALT with estimates
of uncertainty; (3) provide details on how to aggregate data to plot,
site, and paired burned--unburned means and provide a summary of the
dataset; and (4) discuss the strengths and limitations of the dataset,
along with its potential uses.

[[One new system that could]{.mark} help to [address]{.mark} the
[missing data]{.mark} on the effects of this thawing permafrost [is a
satellite **specifically designed** to monitor and quantify]{.mark}
global **[methane emissions]{.mark}**. Called MethaneSAT, it was
developed and managed by the Environmental Defense Fund
(EDF)]{.underline}, in collaboration with scientists at Harvard, and
just began operations in March of this year. [Steven Hamburg, chief
scientist at the EDF, points out that this situation is dynamic and
constantly changing. "[People assume we know a lot more about
g]{.mark}reen[h]{.mark}ouse [g]{.mark}as emissions [than we actually do,
and we need **high quality**]{.mark} data, we need **[empirical
data]{.mark}**," and that's something this satellite will begin to
provide.]{.underline}

Now that the satellite is operational, he said, "we will start putting
out data that will start to provide an empirical basis of comparing
emissions around the world." While it will primarily be focused on
emissions from oil and gas drilling operations and agriculture, it will
also start to collect data of emissions from thawing permafrost as well

Holdren added that while there has been extensive data collection on the
amounts of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere overall, "what
we don't have real data on, to any very great extent, is the
identification of exactly where those emissions are coming from. And
that's very important from the standpoint of crafting mitigation
measures, in terms of crafting adaptation measures."

While adaptation measures, such as moving entire villages to more stable
ground, can be very expensive, Natali said "the cost of doing nothing is
more expensive than the cost of doing something. And the longer we wait
and continue to talk about how we shouldn't do anything because it's
expensive, it's going to get more and more expensive."

And, she added, "there's always a cost. We're spending the money right
now, continuously fixing roads, continuously dealing with all of this.
So, it's not that we're going from free right now if we do nothing, and
then this big cost if we do something. It's actually a continual cost"
no matter what.

But [[as research continues and better data gets gathered]{.mark}, the
panelists expressed hope that with this information in hand, [people
will be better able to address the problem and]{.mark} find ways to
**[limit the damage]{.mark}**. "The key here is that we are bringing new
technology and we're bringing new capacity and I think we're seeing a

Currently, 174 wildfires are burning in Canada. Many of these fires are
massive and out of control. This has led to a state of emergency being
declared in both Manitoba and Saskatchewan, as thousands have had to
evacuate their homes.

**[With resources depleted and firefighters stretched thin, Canada has
requested assistance from the US]{.underline}** and other international
bodies to combat the wildfires.

The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center has moved to the highest
alert level, Level 5, indicating a \"potential to exhaust all agency
fire resources.\" This was also declared in 2024, but the alert comes
nearly two months earlier than it did last year, due to the hot and dry
conditions Canada has been experiencing.

that resources, including an air tanker, 150 firefighters, support

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May expressed her frustration that more air
bombers from Canada were not being deployed to fight the fires.

\"We make water bombers here in Canada. Why are we not fully equipped
with a national flying force?\" - Elizabeth May

While other countries have also stepped up to help Canada battle the
blazes throughout the country, it is likely still going to be weeks
until any control and progress over the fires is made, with all fire
personnel hoping this occurs before wildfires begin to break out in
countries offering assistance.

Smoke From The Wildfires Has Led To Several US States Being Under Air
Quality Alerts

As the thick smoke from the wildfires has blanketed Canada, forecasters
have warned that the smoke will also impact those in the Northern Plains
and the Midwest. This triggered air quality warnings for states through
the weekend and some into the start of the following week.

The states facing the most intense air quality warnings include:

What forecasters did not anticipate was the smoke becoming as widespread
as it has. Instead of just affecting the Northern Plains and Midwest,
the smoke has spread as far north as the Arctic and as far south as
Florida.

As the fires continue to burn, the amount of smoke will continue to ebb
and flow into the US. Consequently, states that have already been
affected by the heavy smoke should pay close attention to their local
forecasts and heed air quality warnings as applicable.

Forecast Is Not Promising For Firefighters Battling The Canadian
Wildfires

The heat that Canada has been experiencing over the last several days is
expected to last through the weekend. With a cold front on the way, many
thought that the weather might be the key for firefighters to gain the
upper hand on the numerous fires that continue to burn out of control.

Unfortunately, while the weather will be cooler and the hot spell that
has had much of Canada dealing with unseasonably hot weather, according
to Danielle Desjardins, a meteorologist with Environment and Climate
Change Canada, not only will the cold front not reach the regions in
Saskatchewan where the fires are, the weather could make conditions
worse for those working to gain the upper hand on the fires.

\"The bad news about this cold front is it\'s going to be windy.\" -
Danielle Desjardins

Adding in wind and a lack of rain, according to Desjardins, is the
perfect recipe for fire spread.

Any precipitation Canada is forecasted to receive this week will not
improve conditions for any of the fires burning out of control.

With 174 wildfires burning as of Friday, it is going to take more than
just the assistance of outside agencies to bring the inferno that Canada
is experiencing to an end.

Saskatchewan, Manitoba, British Columbia, and Alberta desperately need
Mother Nature to cooperate. Otherwise, there is a very real chance that
the fires burning now could grow even further out of control.

Taking action to address wildland fires

A total of 90 participants joined the two-day Sharing Circle. Presenters
and participants submitted 15 Arctic wildland fire initiatives both from
within and outside of the Arctic Council.

T[he topic of wildland fires is an issue which encompasses activities
across several of the Arctic Council Working Groups, providing strong
collaboration potentia]{.underline}l[. To monitor and better understand
wildland fires,]{.underline} the Arctic Council Working Group, Arctic
Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP), continuously assesses
emissions from circumpolar fires as well as models current and future
fires as part of its work monitoring short-lived climate forcers and
climate change.

[CAFF's Arctic Fire project focuses on co-production**, linking
Indigenous Knowledge with fire ecology.**]{.underline} [The project
involves collecting data on fire, best practices on fire management in
the context of biodiversity and highlighting Indigenous Knowledge
generation for a special issue journal on wildland fires in the Arctic
in order to augment and enhance what we know about Arctic
fire.]{.underline}

The Arctic Contaminants Action Program (ACAP)Working Group is focused on
the prevention and reduction of pollution in the Arctic. It recently
began a pilot project called "Wildland fire management practices to
reduce emissions of black carbon and other air pollutants" to build
capacity in Arctic communities to manage fire-related pollutants and
potentially reduce emissions\".

For the Sustainable Development Working Group (SDWG), which focuses on
enhancing the environment, economies, culture and health of Arctic
Peoples and communities, the management and impact of Arctic fires is a
topic that overlaps naturally with its ongoing community-based work.
While there aren't any current SDWG projects directly related to Arctic
fires, it welcomed future projects with this focus.

[Emergency preparedness and response to Arctic wildland fires is
addressed in the Arctic Council through EPPR's Circumpolar Wildland Fire
project.]{.underline} The project assesses instruments and best
practices for emergency response to wildland fire. [It aims to improve
the coordinated response by Arctic States and Indigenous Permanent
Participants in response to wildland fires in the Arctic, and to promote
international cooperation and contracting of resources across state
boundaries and relevant agencies. The project is focused on developing a
template with clauses relevant for wildfire response and training,
summarizing how each Arctic State manages operational response and
creating a summary of standard practices and training by
state]{.underline}.

Outside the auspices of the Arctic Council, several projects within
Arctic States were highlighted.

[ArcResc is a new initiative funded by the Ministry of Interior Finland
seeking collaboration on best operational practices in Arctic
environments. Representatives of EMERCOM, the Russian Federation's
Ministry of Emergency Situations, presented the agency's use of global
satellite imagery to track and inform wildfire operations and spoke of
the need for collaboration in the Arctic to tackle
wildfires.]{.underline}

Several experts presented new tools, data, visualizations and research
on Arctic wildfires.

Elena Kukavskaya, an expert in wildfires, forestry and remote sensing,
presented geospatial products for estimating wildland fire fuel loads
for central Siberia. Because Siberia constitutes a large portion of the
global terrestrial carbon stock, wildfires and anthropogenic land use
like timber extraction can impact the global carbon cycle.

Juha Aalto from the Finnish Meteorological Institute presented results
of the multi-year IBA Forest Fires in Fennoscandia project, which showed
a decreased burned area in forest fires over the past 30 years, with
forest fire frequency and behavior dependent on weather, forest
structure and human behavior including fire suppression.

What are wildland fires, what causes them, and what is the Arctic
Council doing?

Enhancing wildland fire cooperation

**[A major outcome of the Sharing Circle was that new conversations
began across organizations, states, Indigenous Peoples, Working Groups,
and other experts, and existing networks could be built upon. Wildland
fire cuts across the boundaries of science, social issues, biodiversity
and environmental protection. Building connections across disciplines
will be essential as Arctic wildland fire projects
advance.]{.underline}**

The Sharing Circle served as a starting point for Arctic wildland fire
discussion, collaboration and cooperation. Although work is already
underway, much more remains to be done.

"We know fire doesn't respect territorial integrity. Smoke travels from
Sweden to Russian communities and from Siberia to Alaska. Fires run
across borders, all the time," said Edward Alexander. "We're still
finding our direction in how we cooperate on the issue of fire, and how
we learn from each other. It's imperative that we do so all together,
and with the utmost respect."

As wildfire seasons become longer and more extreme, [the Government of

long-term response. Countries are increasingly looking to their allies
to provide mutual aid during wildfire emergencies and other extreme
weather events. As Canada faces a current wildfire season that has
already been among the worst, we are strengthening our shared work with
allies.]{.underline}

Today, [the Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Canada's Minister of Natural
Resources, and David L. Cohen, United States Ambassador to Canada,
signed an arrangement that strengthens the two countries' long-standing
cooperation to **combat wildland fires** and **protect communities** in
the face of this climate change--driven threat.]{.underline}

[This Memorandum of Understanding (**MOU**) between Natural Resources
Canada and the United States of America's Departments of Agriculture and

relationship on the exchange of wildland fire management resources
between the two countries by:]{.underline}

● [setting out procedures for the exchange of these resources;
and]{.underline}

● [establishing a framework that encourages **mutual assistance** and
**cooperation**.]{.underline}

[Through this arrangement, Canada and the United States of America are
providing **enhanced protection** for their citizens by ensuring a more
efficient exchange of wildfire suppression resources across
international borders. It also facilitates information-sharing that
expands wildland fire management knowledge.]{.underline}

Prior to this MOU, reciprocal wildfire support was predicated on several
individual arrangements and processes and was focused solely on
suppression. [This arrangement will ensure that mutual aid is
efficiently and effectively deployed where it is needed most, on both
sides of the border, by expanding the scope of cooperation to include
prevention, research, innovation, technical cooperation and risk
mitigation.]{.underline}

Under the arrangement, [both countries acknowledge the benefits of
continuing to work collectively across their borders through **shared
values**]{.underline}. This arrangement, and other initiatives like it,
show how international collaboration can help countries manage the
increasing challenges of extreme weather events in the face of climate
change.

[Canada and the United States will continue to **work together** to
adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change, protecting
communities, livelihoods and our environment for generations to
come.]{.underline}

#### usfg is key to solve for wildfires. The most severe wildfires occur on federal lands. 

Sheila **Campbell**, June 20**22**, Congressional Budget Office,
<https://www.cbo.gov/publication/58212#_idTextAnchor048>, Wildfires

**Wildfires Summary** [Fires]{.underline} have always burned on
wildlands, and they [have important ecological functions in many
ecosystems]{.underline}. Over the past 30 years, though,
[wildfires]{.underline} have burned vegetation [on]{.underline} an
[increasing amount of land in the United States]{.underline} and brought
with them [environmental, health-related, and economic
impacts]{.underline}. Forest-management practices, climate change, and
expanding populations in high-risk areas have all contributed to the
growth of wildfires and their effects. Wildfires also affect the federal
budget through spending on fire suppression, forest management, disaster
assistance, and other activities. **How Extensive Are Wildfires in the
United States?** [The increase in the wildland area burned by fire over
the past three decades has occurred both on federal lands and on lands
owned by state and local governments and the private
sector]{.underline}. From 2017 to 2021, an average of [60,000
wildfires]{.underline} occurred [each year]{.underline}, and about
[one-fifth of them were on federal lands]{.underline}. (Those lands are
mostly under the management of the U.S. Forest Service and several
agencies in the Department of the Interior, or DOI.) Over that same
period, the average annual area burned exceeded 8 million acres. [Though
fewer in number, federal fires typically affect a larger area than other
wildfires]{.underline}; [their average size over the 1991--2021 period
was more than five times that of fires on nonfederal lands]{.underline}.
Large wildfires are particularly prevalent in western states. In 2021,
for example, wildfires larger than 40,000 acres burned more than 2.3
million acres in California, about 500,000 acres in Oregon, and 400,000
acres in Washington. Estimates of wildfires' severity from satellite
observations show that, on average, between 2014 and 2018, about
one-third of the burned areas that were evaluated experienced high or
moderate levels of burn severity, meaning that much of the vegetation
was consumed and the effects were expected to be long-lasting. About
half of the acres burned at a low level of severity, and an additional
14 percent of the areas evaluated were estimated to have been unburned
or to have shown minimal burn severity and were expected to recover
quickly. **Why Have Wildfires Increased Over the Past 30 Years?**
According to researchers, several factors have contributed to the
increase in wildfire activity. To begin with, [forest-management
practices for much of the past century have allowed vegetation to grow
denser, particularly in wildland areas that historically experienced
frequent fires. That dense vegetation can fuel fires, especially in
times of extreme fire weather, when a combination of conditions---low
humidity, strong winds, high temperatures, and drought---makes fires
more likely to ignite and burn. In addition, climate change has created
hotter, drier conditions that are more conducive to wildfires. Finally,
more people are living in and adjacent to wildland areas, which can
increase the risk of damage from wildfires to households, businesses,
and governments and can complicate efforts to contain
fires.]{.underline} **How Do Wildfires Affect the Federal Budget?**
Wildfires affect the federal budget both directly and indirectly.
Directly, federal spending on fire suppression on federal lands averaged
\$2.5 billion per fiscal year (in 2020 dollars) between 2016 and 2020.
Indirectly, the federal budget is affected through spending on health
care following smoke exposure, disruptions to military operations,
agricultural assistance, and risks to federal timber sales. State and
local governments and the private sector are responsible for fires that
develop on nonfederal lands, although governments at all levels
frequently coordinate efforts and share equipment and crews. If a
wildfire or its impact exceeds the capacity of state and local
governments to respond, the federal government may provide financial
assistance through several disaster assistance programs. About \$5
billion has been obligated for such assistance for disasters declared
during the 2016--2020 period. **How Do Wildfires Affect the Environment,
People's Health, and the Economy?** Wildfires are a key ecological
process in many ecosystems throughout the United States. The more severe
wildfires that have occurred in recent years---as a result of
forest-management practices that have aimed to eliminate fires and
climate conditions that are more conducive to fires---have had a broad
range of ecological effects, including these: Debris and contaminants
negatively affect water resources. Wildfires increasingly contribute to
emissions of carbon dioxide and air pollution, including fine
particulate matter. Wildfire smoke reaches far beyond burned areas,
causing a variety of respiratory and other adverse health effects.
Wildfires' effects on vegetation varies (both across fires and within
the bounds of any individual fire) and can be severe and long-lasting.
The economic impact of wildfires depends on their location, size,
duration, and severity and can be extensive. Wildfires can damage and
destroy infrastructure, cause business closures, disrupt transportation
and supply networks, affect employment, and alter state and local tax
revenues. Damage to homes from wildfires is covered under standard
homeowners' insurance policies, and insurers have begun to increase
rates or exit regions where a large volume of wildfire claims have
occurred in recent years. **How Are Forests Managed to Reduce Wildfire
Risks?** [Dense vegetation, especially when dry, provides fuel for
wildfires to spread under certain conditions]{.underline}. Research
suggests that fuel treatments, including the use of prescribed fires,
mechanical thinning of dense vegetation (using tools or heavy equipment
to remove trees), and managed wildfire incidents in remote areas, can
reduce the extent and severity of wildfires that encounter those treated
areas. Several studies that examined the efficacy of appropriate fuel
treatments in specific areas found that they were generally
cost-effective; they reduced expected suppression costs or lessened
expected risks to local homes and infrastructure. Those types of fuel
treatments are currently used more extensively by nonfederal landowners
than by the federal government. In addition to cost, several impediments
may hinder policymakers from expanding the use of fuel treatments on
federal lands. For prescribed fires, those considerations include air
pollution regulations, liability concerns, weather conditions, and the
availability of appropriate fire personnel. For mechanical treatments,
forest managers would need to evaluate whether sawmills and other wood
treatment facilities had sufficient capacity to process treated
materials. **Trends in Wildfire Activity** [The average annual amount of
land affected by wildfires in the United States has increased over the
past 30 years. Wildfires are expanding in size, on average, though the
number of wildfires started each year has not]{.underline}. Wildfires
are larger in western states and [tend to be bigger when they occur on
land owned by the federal government than on state, local, or privately
owned land]{.underline}. A combination of factors---the effects of
forest-management practices, climate change, and expansion of urban
areas---contributes to determining when and where a fire might ignite,
how large it might grow, how it might affect ecosystems and communities,
and how successful efforts might be to suppress or contain it.
**Wildfires on Federal and Nonfederal Lands** Over the past three
decades, the number of wildfires each year has declined somewhat, and
the total area affected by those fires has increased substantially. In
2021, nearly 59,000 wildfires occurred in the United States, fewer than
the nearly 76,000 that occurred in 1991 (see [Figure
1](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/58212#_idTextAnchor008), top panel).
The five-year moving average of the number of wildfires has decreased as
well, falling from an average of about 82,000 fires per year between
2006 and 2010 to about 60,000 fires per year between 2017 and 2021.
(Because the number of fires fluctuates from year to year, five-year
moving averages give a clearer picture of the trends than the numbers do
in any single year.) **Figure 1. Number of Wildfires and Acres Burned,
1987 to 2021** The number of wildfires that occur each year in the
United States has fluctuated over the past 30 years. Over the past
decade, the five-year moving average of the number of wildfires has
decreased. There has been no comparable decrease in the land area
affected by wildfires because the average wildfire has grown larger over
time. Although the number of acres burned fluctuates from year to year,
by 2021 the five-year moving average of acres burned was about double
what it had been in the early 1990s. Notes The split between fires begun
on federal and nonfederal lands does not vary widely. [Each year,
between 20 percent and 30 percent of fires begin on federal land, and
between 70 percent and 80 percent occur on land owned by state and local
governments or the private sector. The decrease in the number of fires
over the past decade has been consistent across federal and nonfederal
lands: The five-year moving average for fires on federal lands has
declined by 23 percent and for fires on nonfederal lands, 26
percent]{.underline}. [The total number of acres burned in wildfires has
markedly increased in the past 30 years,]{.underline} though. About 7
million acres burned in 2021, more than double the 3 million acres
burned in 1991 (see [Figure
1](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/58212#_idTextAnchor008), bottom
panel). Fewer acres burned in 2021 than in 2020, when about 10 million
acres burned, the second-highest amount recorded in recent years. The
five-year moving average of acres burned dipped lower in the 2010s, but
by 2021 it had again exceeded 8 million acres per year (an area about
the size of Maryland), close to the high reached in 2008. Fires on
federal lands accounted for more than half of the acres burned in
wildfires in all but five years between 1991 and 2021. In most years,
between 50 percent and 70 percent of the acres burned in wildfires were
on federal lands. The combination of fewer fires and more acres burned
means that wildfires on federal lands are typically larger than those
that occur on land owned by state and local governments or the private
sector. Fires on federal lands are often in more remote or less
populated and developed areas, so less effort may be made to suppress or
contain them.[^1^](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/58212#footnote-068)
The average size of the 495,000 fires that burned on federal lands
between 1991 and 2021 was 225 acres, more than five times the 41-acre
average size of the 1.8 million nonfederal fires (see [Figure
2](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/58212#_idTextAnchor010)). The average
size of both federal and nonfederal fires grew over the period as well:
By 2021, federal fires were nearly four times larger than in 1991, on
average, and nonfederal fires were about two times larger than those
measured in 1991. **Figure 2. Total Number of Wildfires on Federal and
Nonfederal Lands and Average Acres per Fire, 1991 to 2021** [Although
fewer wildfires occur on federal lands than on nonfederal lands, fires
that burn on federal lands have been about five times larger, on
average, over the past three decades. Wildfires on federal lands are
more likely to occur in remote areas and threaten fewer structures and
communities, which may reduce the urgency of suppression
efforts.]{.underline} Notes **Regional Differences in Wildfire
Activity** Wildfires are not evenly distributed across the country.
[Large wildfires---those exceeding 40,000 acres---occur mostly in the
western part of the country, particularly in the states along the coast
of the Pacific Ocean (Alaska, California, Oregon, and Washington). In
most years since 2010, the states in the Plains and Mountain West have
seen fewer acres burned in those large wildfires than have the Pacific
states (see]{.underline} [Figure
3](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/58212#_idTextAnchor013)[).]{.underline}
Large wildfires have been less prevalent in southern states, although
more acres burned in fires larger than 40,000 acres in the South in 2011
than in the Pacific and Mountain West states combined. (Conditions in
the South that spring were far drier than normal, and numerous large
fires burned in Texas at that time.) capacity.

### 2AC -- YES RUSSIA COOP

#### Russia will agree to US science cooperation within the Arctic Council working groups -- that includes ArcResc!!! ☺ 

**Meduza**, 20**25** - a Russian- and English-language independent news
website, headquartered in Riga, Latvia. Article interviews Illa
Shumanov, the director of the Arctida project, non-profit organization
focused on analysis and investigation within the Russian Arctic, and
Arild Moe, Senior Research Fellow at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute
(Norway). "Breaking the ice As the U.S. and Russia tease Arctic
cooperation, climate science could offer common ground --- but neither
side seems interested" 4/22,

<https://meduza.io/en/feature/2025/04/22/breaking-the-ice> //DH

Indeed, while Trump has yet to deliver the swift peace in Ukraine he
once promised, [talk of U.S.- Russia cooperation in the Arctic has
expanded into]{.underline} ambitious (if [vague)]{.underline}
[proposals]{.underline} --- potentially [spanning]{.underline}
everything [from trade routes to energy development]{.underline}
projects, according to Trump envoy Steve Witkoff. But even amid the
attempted rapprochement between Washington and Moscow, serious obstacles
to Arctic cooperation remain.

As Arild Moe, research professor at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute, told
Meduza, [while Trump may have grand ideas about U.S. companies getting
involved, he doesn't have the power to dictate strategic decisions to
private American firms]{.underline} the way Putin does to Russian
state-owned companies. "[There's no deal that can commit American
business to investments in Russia happening overnight,]{.underline}" Moe
said. [For any of this to be plausible, the risks would have to be
manageable --- and]{.underline} right now, Moe said, "[long-term
investments in Russia look quite risky]{.underline} because the economic
\[and\] political situation is unpredictable."

[Even if sanctions were lifted, "American companies don't seem
particularly eager to return to the Russian market right
now,"]{.underline} Shumanov concurred. There's also the matter of
nationalization, which the Kremlin has been actively using to seize
foreign-owned assets since the full-scale war began. As Shumanov put it,
when Trump leaves office, "Vladimir Putin, if the mood strikes him,
could easily sign another decree nationalizing the next enterprise."

With joint business ventures still difficult to justify --- and military
cooperation all but unimaginable --- Shumanov believes [[the most
realistic area for]{.mark} actual [engagement is environmental
science]{.mark}]{.underline}[. "[Joint climate
research]{.underline}]{.mark}, coordination, disaster prevention ---
that kind of collaboration [**[could start tomorrow]{.underline}**,
[even with major political differences]{.underline}]{.mark}," he told
Meduza. "[[Russian and American scientists]{.underline}]{.mark} and
climate experts [**[could meet through Arctic Council working
groups]{.underline}** [and begin working together]{.underline}."]{.mark}

The [Arctic Council]{.underline} --- an intergovernmental forum focused
on scientific and environmental cooperation --- has managed to survive
not only Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine but also Finland and
Sweden's accession to NATO, which left Russia the lone non-NATO country
in the Arctic Circle. "It was almost on its deathbed," Moe said, "but it
seems that all parties wanted it to remain."

Still, he said, "the level of contact and [[cooperation within that
framework is at a very low level today]{.underline}]{.mark}" --- though
he acknowledged that international interest coupled with concern for the
region's vulnerability could lead to renewed cooperation.

Restoring Cooperation

Two years into the war in Ukraine, [[there are some headways in
Russia-West Arctic cooperation]{.underline}. [Norway took
over]{.underline}]{.mark} the chair of [[the Arctic
Council]{.underline}]{.mark} in 2023 [[and is gradually resuming work
with Russia.]{.underline}]{.mark}

In February 2024, the council announced that official meetings of
project and expert working groups will resume in a digital format. A
month before, [[Norway's chief Arctic official,]{.underline}]{.mark}
Morten Høglund, [[met in person with]{.underline}]{.mark} the six
Indigenous peoples' organizations, including [[two representatives from
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Norway's relationship]{.underline}]{.mark} with Russia [[can serve as
an example]{.underline}]{.mark} for dealing with Russia under the
current political circumstances. In recent years[[, Norway has imposed
sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark} against Russia, signed a bilateral
defense agreement with the United States, and hosted NATO troops in the
largest military exercise since the Cold War. [[At the same time, Norway
continues collaboration with Russia to comanage fisheries in the Barents
Sea]{.underline}]{.mark}, the Norwegian-Russian border, [[and Coast
Guard rescue]{.underline}]{.mark} operations.

Similarly[, [the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[maintains some]{.mark} channels of
[cooperation with Russia in the Arctic]{.mark}, especially [in the
Bering Strait]{.mark}. The US and Russian Coast Guards maintain lines of
communication to protect people and marine resources on both sides of
the strait]{.underline}. While joint exercises have been on hold, [the
US and Russian Coast Guards still commit to the enduring agreements on
search-and-rescue and emergency operations]{.underline}. [Cooperation
continues even against the background of provocative Russian naval
exercises off the coast of Alaska]{.underline}.

Moreover, [there is collaboration at the individual and informal levels.
Some academic conferences in the US and Russia, where scientists share
research on Arctic natural and social sciences, still involve Russian
and American researchers]{.underline}. Such developments demonstrate
that [[while relations may have been mostly severed, there are still
narrow openings for cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} [[around issues
that are seen as essential]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Lessons from History

Despite the stark challenges of reigniting full-fledged cooperation
today, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[and Russia have a **long history of polar science cooperation** and
diplomacy over common interests during times of geopolitical
confrontation]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[During the Cold War, American and Russian researchers engaged in
numerous scientific exchanges]{.underline}]{.mark} and joined dozens of
countries to study sea ice, aurora borealis and polar meteorology as
part of the 1957--58 International Geophysical Year. In the 1970s, the
US and USSR signed landmark agreements on environmental protection and
polar bear conservation.

At the end of the Cold War, [[the cooperation between Soviet and Western
Arctic scientists built interstate trust and **spilled over** into the
political and military spheres]{.underline}]{.mark}. In a famous 1987
speech in northern Russia, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev recognized
that "the community and interrelationship of the interests of our entire
world is felt in the Arctic, perhaps more than anywhere else," and that
"scientific exploration of the Arctic is of immense importance for the
whole of mankind." Gorbachev's ruminations went on to inspire the 1996
formation of the Arctic Council.

After the Cold War, US-Russia Arctic cooperation skyrocketed as Western
researchers poured into the previously inaccessible Russian Arctic.
Notable collaborations include the Russian-American Long-term Census of
the Arctic (RUSALCA, which means "mermaid" in Russian). Across several
expeditions to the Bering and Chukchi Seas between 2004 and 2015,
Russian and American scientists jointly studied marine chemistry,
glaciology, oceanography, and ecosystems.

RUSALCA existed "as a miracle," according to its participants, because
of initial opposition from Russian and American security services. The
project continued against the background of political tensions related
to the 2008 Russo-Georgian War and 2014 Ukraine crisis. Such examples
offer practical examples for common-interest cooperation despite steep
political disagreements.

Today, [[climate science has fallen victim to]{.mark} the diplomatic
fallout of the [war in Ukraine]{.mark}. [Nonetheless, there remains
significant]{.mark} and ongoing [support from international
scientists]{.mark} and Arctic residents [for Moscow and Washington
to]{.mark} find a common understanding in [study]{.mark}ing and tackling
[the Arctic climate crisis]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Scientific cooperation]{.mark}, an [essential]{.mark} endeavor [for
the world's **survival**, can help **build trust** between the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and Russia, and **prevent a
conflict**]{.mark}]{.underline} in a region that has not seen interstate
violence since World War II.

#### 66% of Arctic infrastructure is built on permafrost

**Arctic Council ND** \[The Arctic Council is the leading
intergovernmental forum promoting cooperation, coordination and

Climate change affects all regions and countries of the world, and the
Arctic is warming three times faster than the rest of the planet^1^.
[The entire territory of the North, Siberia and the Russian Far East is
a place of traditional settlement of Indigenous Peoples, and most of it
lies on permafrost, land that is frozen year-round.]{.underline}

[As the Arctic warms and permafrost is no longer permanent, inhabitants
of Russia's Arctic are experiencing]{.underline} troubling and
[sometimes dangerous disruptions to their lives.]{.underline}

Climate warming in the Arctic is leading to a significant change in the
economic activities of Indigenous peoples. The migration routes of wild
animals are changing, which means that hunters carry additional
temporary, transport and material resources. Nomad reindeer herders have
fewer opportunities to choose good calving sites due to the early spring
floods. Fishermen note that the water has become warmer and the fish go
to depths where the temperature regime is more suitable for them, but
this reduces the chances of fishermen for a good catch of fish.*Grigorii
Dyukarev, RAIPON / Co-vice Chair of SDWG*

Near-surface permafrost in the High Arctic and other very cold areas has
warmed by more than 0.5°C since 2007--2009, and the layer of the ground
that thaws in summer has deepened in most areas where permafrost is
monitored.*- Snow, Water, Ice and Permafrost in the Arctic (SWIPA)

Arctic natural and anthropogenic systems are undergoing unprecedented
changes1, with [permafrost thaw as one of the most striking impacts in
the terrestrial cryosphere]{.underline}2,3,4. [In addition
to]{.underline} the potential [adverse effects on global
climate]{.underline}5, [ecosystems]{.underline}6, [and human
health]{.underline}7, [warming and thaw of near-surface
permafrost]{.underline} may [impair critical
infrastructure8]{.underline},9. [This could pose a serious threat to the
utilization of natural resources]{.underline}10, [and to the sustainable
development of Arctic communities]{.underline}9,11,12. [Extensive
summaries of damage to infrastructure along with adaptation and
mitigation strategies are available]{.underline}11,13,14,15,16,17,18.
[Benchmark reports]{.underline}1,13,14 [call for pan-Arctic geohazard
explorations and infrastructure risk assessments, but only regional
studies]{.underline}17,19,20,21 [have been conducted]{.underline} since
ref. 8[. There is an urgent need for pan-Arctic geohazard mapping at
high spatial resolution and an assessment of how changes in circumpolar
permafrost conditions could affect infrastructure]{.underline}1,14.
Owing to the increasing economic and environmental relevance of the
Arctic1,5,10, [it is]{.underline} of a [vital importance to gain
detailed knowledge about risk exposure in areas of current and future
infrastructure]{.underline}8,9,10,11,12,13,14,18. The aim of this study
was to first, map infrastructure hazard areas in the Northern
Hemisphere's permafrost regions at unprecedentedly high (\~1 km) spatial
resolution under projected climatic changes and second, quantify the
amount and proportion of engineering structures in areas where ground
subsidence and loss of structural bearing capacity could damage
infrastructure by 2050.

Standardized in-situ observations of ground temperature and thaw depth,
geospatial environmental data, and ensemble methodologies22 were used to
model the current and future ground thermal regime in the Northern
Hemisphere's permafrost domain23 (Methods). In the ensemble forecasting,
the observations of ground thermal regime were related to physically
relevant environmental variables using four statistical techniques at 30
arc-second resolution. The ensemble model provided accurate predictions
of the observed ground temperatures retrospectively, indicating
potential for good performance in prognostic studies23. [The focus was
on thaw of near-surface permafrost]{.underline} (\<15 m depth) [owing to
its central role for infrastructure]{.underline} (defined here as
facilities with permanent foundations on ice-free land)
[hazards]{.underline}1,8,9,13,14. Future conditions were considered
using Representative Concentration Pathways24 (RCPs) 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5
for 2041--2060 and 2061--2080. Near-surface permafrost was considered to
thaw when mean annual ground temperature (MAGT) at or near (the closest
to) the depth of zero annual amplitude changed from ≤0 °C to \>0 °C
between the baseline (2000--2014) and future period. [In an engineering
context, the selected threshold is conservative because
infrastructure]{.underline} (e.g., buildings) [could experience thaw
settlements and failure before the thaw of near-surface
permafrost]{.underline}. However, a conservative threshold is justified
considering the use of statistically based methodology in modelling of
the ground thermal regime (Methods). In the results, we focus on medium
stabilization scenario RCP4.5 (total radiative forcing is stabilized
shortly after 2100)25 for 2041--2060 (hereafter 2050). This period was
chosen acknowledging the relatively short lifespan (often 20--50 years)
of infrastructure in the Arctic12,13. Thus our analyses, conducted at
unprecedentedly high spatial resolution[, are useful for indicating
near-future at-risk areas owing to the degradation]{.underline} (i.e.
warming and thaw) [of permafrost]{.underline}.

Carbon Stockpile

Permafrost is ground that has been permanently frozen for anywhere from
two years to hundreds of thousands of years. A core of it reveals thick
layers of icy soils enriched with dead plant and animal matter that can
be dated using radiocarbon and other techniques. **[When permafrost
thaws and decomposes, [microbes feed on this organic carbon, releasing
some of it as greenhouse gases]{.mark}.]{.underline}**This map shows the
extent of Arctic permafrostThis map, based on data provided by the
National Snow and Ice Data Center, shows the extent of Arctic
permafrost. The amount of permafrost underlying the surface ranges from
continuous --- in the coldest areas --- to more isolated and sporadic
patches. Credit: NASA Earth Observatory

Unlocking a fraction of the carbon stored in permafrost could further
fuel climate change. **[[Temperatures in the Arctic are already warming
two to four times faster than the global average]{.mark}, and
s[cientists are learning how thawing permafrost is shifting the region
from being a net sink]{.mark} for greenhouse gases [to becoming a net

ground-based instruments, aircraft, and satellites. One such campaign,
NASA's Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE), is focused on
Alaska and western Canada. Yet locating and measuring emissions across

undertaken as part of the Global Carbon Project's RECCAP-2 effort, which
brings together different science teams, tools, and datasets to assess
regional carbon balances every few years. The authors followed the trail
of three greenhouse gases --- carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide
--- across 7 million square miles (18 million square kilometers) of
permafrost terrain from 2000 to 2020.Never Miss a DiscoverySubscribe to

Researchers found the region, especially the forests, took up a fraction
more carbon dioxide than it released. This uptake was largely offset by
carbon dioxide emitted from lakes and rivers, as well as from fires that
burned both forest and tundra.They also found that the region's lakes
and wetlands were strong sources of methane during those two decades.
Their waterlogged soils are low in oxygen while containing large volumes
of dead vegetation and animal matter --- ripe conditions for hungry
microbes. Compared to carbon dioxide, methane can drive significant
climate warming in short timescales before breaking down relatively
quickly[. **[Methane's lifespan in the atmosphere is about 10 years,
whereas carbon dioxide can last hundreds of
years]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}**The findings suggest the
net change in greenhouse gases helped warm the planet over the 20-year
period. But over a 100-year period, emissions and absorptions would
mostly cancel each other out. In other words, the region teeters from
carbon source to weak sink. The authors noted that events such as
extreme wildfires and heat waves are major sources of uncertainty when
projecting into the future.Bottom Up, Top Down

The scientists used two main strategies to tally greenhouse gas
emissions from the region. "Bottom-up" methods estimate emissions from
ground- and air-based measurements and ecosystem models. **[[Top-down
methods use atmospheric measurements taken directly from satellite
sensors]{.mark},]{.underline}** including those on NASA's Orbiting
Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) and JAXA's (Japan Aerospace Exploration
Agency) Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite.Regarding near-term,
20-year, global warming potential, both scientific approaches aligned on
the big picture but differed in magnitude: The bottom-up calculations
indicated significantly more warming.

"This study is one of the first where we are able to integrate different
methods and datasets to put together this very comprehensive greenhouse
gas budget into one report," Chatterjee said. "It reveals a very complex
picture."

[Climate change poses a **significant threat** to the Arctic
ecology]{.underline}. The [Arctic is experiencing a warming rate that is
more than **twice as rapid** as the global average]{.underline},
resulting in [substantial decreases in the thickness and extent of sea
ice]{.underline}. According to Richter-Menge et al. \[130\], this
phenomenon is [referred to as **Arctic amplification**]{.underline}.
[Species]{.underline} that depend on ice for reproduction, feeding, and
protection are [at risk due to the loss of ice habitat]{.underline}
\[94\]. Furthermore, [as a result of climate change]{.underline},
[habitats and migration patterns are changing]{.underline}, [affecting
indigenous populations]{.underline} as well as regional economies that
rely on hunting, fishing, and tourism \[118\]. These warming
temperatures and changing ice conditions have the potential to
[impact]{.underline} not only the timing and distribution of primary
production but also [the reproductive cycles of Arctic species and food
webs]{.underline} \[126\].

The [Arctic is very susceptible to pollution]{.underline} from both
nearby and remote sources, making pollution a significant concern in the
region. [Plastic debris, persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and heavy
metals]{.underline} may [accumulate in the frigid, slow degrading
environment]{.underline}. By entering the Arctic through riverine
intake, atmospheric deposition, and ocean currents, these pollutants
[potentially endanger human populations and species that depend on
marine resources]{.underline}. For example, Lee \[98\] reports on the
impact of toxic elements and POPs on avian influenzas prevalence in
Arctic seabirds.

The [increased **availability** of resources]{.underline} (such as oil,
gas, and minerals) that were previously inaccessible as a result of
melting ice is generating commercial interest; however, it is also
[causing environmental damage and disturbing local
population]{.underline}s \[91\]. Concerns have been raised over the
possible impacts that [human activities, such as shipping, oil and gas
exploration, and commercial fishing]{.underline}, may have on the Arctic
marine ecosystem. These activities have the [potential to cause
habitat]{.underline} 3 Arctic Marine Ecosystems 48
[disruption]{.underline}, pollution, [and]{.underline} overfishing that
could have [negative consequences for the marine
environment]{.underline}. Kershaw et al. \[83\] reported the declining
reproductive success in humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae)
reflected by ecosystem shifts on their feeding ground. Specifically, the
emergence of [new shipping routes as a result of ice melting raises the
likelihood of oil spills and other accidents, which can cause
devastating damage to the delicate Arctic environment]{.underline}
\[56\]. Moreover, the [**geopolitical tensions** arising from conficting
territorial claims and interests between Arctic states exacerbate
strained ties and escalate regional instability]{.underline} \[78\].

[Jacqueline Goordial, a CIFAR Azrieli **Global Scholar**]{.underline} in
the Earth 4D: Subsurface Science & Exploration program, recalls her last
visit to the Canadian Arctic. From the helicopter, she and her team flew
over a [large **permafrost** site]{.underline} that is [thawing at such
a pace that the edges of its structure are slumping]{.underline}, as
though a giant had taken a bite out of the soil underneath the surface.

Once on land, and venturing through thigh-high mud and tundra, the team
drove their instruments deep into the permafrost face, next to a
**[thousand year old]{.underline}** wedge of ice formation --- they were
there to [measure **methane** levels seeping out from the frozen
ground.]{.underline}

The [next day,]{.underline} they came back to find the [permafrost thaw
face had **melted away**]{.underline}, along with their instruments.

"That was [less than **24 hours**]{.underline}," says Goordial. "This is
a [structure]{.underline} that's been [frozen for thousands of
years]{.underline}, and I [see it erode in real time, inch by inch,
within a day]{.underline}."

The rapid erosion of permafrost is one of a myriad of alarming examples
of the effects of climate change --- whether it is shrinking glaciers,
frequent extreme weather events, increased food scarcity or rising sea
levels. Goordial's work examines how [**microbial life persists** within
extreme subsurface environments such as permafrost]{.underline} and
oceanic crust/marine sediments.

Though Goordial's instruments were irretrievable in that instance, her
team has been successful in collecting methane data in the Canadian
Arctic.

"We [install chambers into the face of the permafrost]{.underline} and
one of the things that we [see]{.underline} is that there is an
[**instant release** of methane coming from these **fast erosional**
features]{.underline}," explains Goordial. "We have [a lot of **old
carbon** frozen away.]{.underline}"

[As the permafrost is rapidly melting, it is releasing trapped methane
from **microorganisms** underground. Methane is **25 times** as potent
at trapping heat in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (CO2), and
eventually **combines** with oxygen to create **CO2**.]{.underline}

[Permafrost in the Northern Hemisphere is currently trapping about
**1,700 tonnes of carbon**, including methane and CO2. In]{.underline} a
March 2021 feature in [Nature]{.underline} on effects of thawing
permafrost, [climate scientists describe the disappearing permafrost
landscape as having the potential to trigger a **massive "carbon
bomb."**]{.underline}

"One of the things that we fear will happen when it thaws is [some of
that carbon will become **newly available** to microorganisms that have
gone from this frozen state, to a **warmer state**]{.underline}. Then,
[through their own **metabolism**, these microorganisms will convert
that carbon into **more greenhouse gases**]{.underline}," explains
Goordial.

Additionally, [permafrost temperatures are rising, leading to thawing
that **releases** stored greenhouse gases]{.underline}, further
amplifying global warming \[94\]. The [thawing of permafrost in the
Arctic has **far-reaching consequences** for both **infrastructure and
ecosystems**]{.underline}. Permafrost, which is ground that remains
frozen for at least two consecutive years, underpins much of the Arctic
landscape. As temperatures rise, the stability of this frozen ground is
compromised, [leading to]{.underline} several negative impacts such as
[structural **damage** in buildings, roads, pipelines, and other
infrastructure built on permafrost which are at risk of damage as the
ground thaws]{.underline} and becomes J. O. Kayode-Edwards et al. 79
unstable \[84\]. The thawing of permafrost can also affect the
reliability of transportation networks as roads and airstrips can become
uneven or impassable, disrupting travel and supply routes for Arctic
communities \[25\].

Furthermore, [settlement]{.underline} (the compression of the ground
beneath a building due to its weight) and subsistence (the movement of
foundations due to the action of materials beneath them) [can cause
foundations to **crack and collapse**, necessitating costly repairs and
redesigns]{.underline}. [Changes in vegetation and ground stability
impact wildlife habitats]{.underline}. Species that rely on specific
conditions, such as the tundra-dwelling caribou and migratory birds, may
find their habitats shrinking or shifting. The thawing permafrost alters
the landscape, affecting plant communities as well. As the ground
becomes wetter, some areas may experience increased plant growth, while
others may see a decline in species that depend on dry, frozen
conditions. The permafrost thawing equally affects the hydrological
cycle, leading to changes in the flow of rivers and streams \[97\].

This can impact fish populations and other aquatic life, as well as
water availability for human use. [Faster flow rates and increased
sediment load can affect fish spawning areas and reduce water quality,
potentially leading to shifts in species composition and **declines in
biodiversity**]{.underline}.

Permafrost contains vast amounts of organic material that, when frozen,
is relatively stable. However, [as permafrost thaws, this organic
material decomposes, releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
Methane is a particularly potent greenhouse gas, with a global warming
potential many times greater than that of carbon dioxide over a 20-year
period]{.underline} \[28\]. [The release of methane from thawing
permafrost can signifcantly amplify global warming as it creates a
positive feedback loop]{.underline}. As more methane is released, global
temperatures rise further, leading to more permafrost thaw and
additional greenhouse gas emissions.

Thawing permafrost also leads to the release of CO2 through the
increased decomposition of organic material. This contributes to the
overall greenhouse gas burden in the atmosphere, with potential impacts
on weather patterns, sea level rise, and the frequency of extreme
weather events. [Current climate models may underestimate the potential
contributions of permafrost thaw to future greenhouse gas
concentrations]{.underline}, highlighting the need for more
comprehensive data and improved modeling.

#### Rapid permafrost melt blows up the entire atmosphere

**Wollersheim 25** \[Dominic Wollersheim; Job One for Humanity Executive

Humanity\"; Job One for Humanity;
https://www.joboneforhumanity.org/tags/sixth_mass_extinction_event;
Accessed 6-27-2025; AY\]

[A **total extinction** event could begin]{.underline} as early as 50-70
years from now[, in the form of a very high average global temperature
and very high atmospheric carbon levels]{.underline} of approximately
750 ppm, which would support the initiation of the final stages of the
runaway global heating process.

[The final stage, runaway global heating, describes the circumstances in
which the global climate destabilizes **catastrophically and
permanently** from its original state---similar to what happened on
Venus when the planet lost its atmosphere out into outer
space.]{.underline} Runaway global warming is thought to have occurred
on Venus approximately 4 billion years ago due to its extremely high
carbon-rich atmosphere and exceptionally high average surface
temperatures.

[The final stage of runaway global warming will create a literal
Climageddon meltdown where nothing will survive because there will be
**no atmosphere**.]{.underline} This total extinction event will enter
its first phase as soon as our average global temperature rises at or
above 5- 6 degrees Celsius.

Somewhere at a 5-6 degree Celsius increase in average global
temperature, [added to the massive additional tipping point of
**releases of methane** from coastal deposits and
permafrost]{.underline}, will quickly [further skyrocket atmospheric
carbon levels and average global temperatures]{.underline} to new levels
faster than at any previous time in humanity\'s history. This will also
trigger, initiate, and accelerate the final phases of runaway global
warming.

Here is how this happens. At a 5-6 degree Celsius temperature increase,
[the coastal deposits and permafrost begin releasing methane at
**exponentially higher rates**, or in other words, the \"methane time
bomb\" goes off.]{.underline}

This will take us from the 5-6 degree Celsius atmospheric carbon level
of 500-600 parts per million (ppm) far too quickly to the atmospheric
carbon levels of 800 ppm, 1,000 ppm, 1,200 ppm, and even to 1,600 ppm
and beyond. (Our climate was stable for hundreds of thousands of years
at about carbon 270 ppm.) We are currently at about carbon 420 ppm. (The
recent carbon 270 to 415 ppm increase occurred since the beginning of
the Industrial Revolution, which was powered by burning fossil fuels.)

Post-[fire changes in the energy balance and subsequent increases in the
active layer thickness have historically recovered to pre-fire
conditions as vegetation succession occurred]{.underline} (Rouse, 1976;
Amiro, 2001; Liu et al., 2005; Amiro et al., 2006), with a maximum
active layer thickness [often observed 5--10 years
post-fire]{.underline} (Rocha et al., 2012; Holloway et al., 2020), [but
this may extend up to 30 or more years post-fire]{.underline} (Gibson et
al., 2018; Kirdyanov et al., 2020; Heim et al., 2021). However, this
pattern of [recovery may be changing alongside climate warming and
shifting fire regimes]{.underline} (Brown et al., 2015), and it may be
further impacted by secondary disturbances (Hayes and Buma, 2021). For
example, [as **wildfire burns across permafrost peatlands**, there is
not only **a thicker and warmer active layer** but also an **expansion
of year-round unfrozen ground**]{.underline} (i.e., taliks) and
thermokarst bogs (Gibson et al., 2018). These changes in active layer
thickness and hydrologic dynamics [can constrain regeneration by
**prolonging vegetation recovery** and inducing shifts in vegetation
composition and structure]{.underline} (Baltzer et al., 2014; Dearborn
et al., 2021). Further, [near-surface permafrost degradation can lead to
ground subsidence, which alters surface hydrology, often leading to
water inundation and further degradation]{.underline} (Brown et al.,
2015). Where wildfires burn across permafrost landforms (e.g.,
thermokarst, ice-rich areas), [**deep and irreversible thawing** could
**permanently alter the landscape**]{.underline} (Burn and Lewkowicz,
1990; Lewkowicz, 2007; Sannel and Kuhry, 2011; Liljedahl et al., 2016;
Rudy et al., 2017; Borge et al., 2017; Mamet et al., 2017; Fraser et
al., 2018), [releasing long-stored soil carbon into the
atmosphere]{.underline} (Schuur et al., 2015). Currently[, **emissions**
from fire-induced permafrost thaw are **underestimated by** the
scientific community and **climate models**]{.underline} (Natali et al.,
2021; Treharne et al., 2022; Schädel et al., 2024), an issue that is
[exacerbated by modeling challenges and uncertainties associated with
permafrost carbon stocks]{.underline} (Hugelius et al., 2014; Turetsky
et al., 2020). The change in active layer thickness over time is a
critical diagnostic indicator of permafrost conditions (Brown et al.,
2000; Shiklomanov et al., 2010) and a vital component of modeling carbon
emissions from fire- and non-fire-related permafrost thaw.

#### [Arctic wildfires]{.underline} are key and a major contributor to climate change.

**WWF 23** \[WWF Global Arctic Programme; The WWF coordinates a number
of countries and offices to collect tools and research to better

https://www.arcticwwf.org/newsroom/features/arctic-connected-wildfires-are-devastating-the-arctic/;
Accessed 7-14-2025; SM**\]**

These [fires are being fueled by extreme weather events like droughts,
heatwaves, and lightning strikes---all of which are a direct result of
climate change]{.underline}. But "zombie fires" are also on the rise in
parts of Alaska and Canada. These are fires that come back to life and
reignite in the spring when the weather warms up, after sitting dormant
for eight or nine months in wet, sub-zero weather. [By 2050, it is
estimated that wildfires in the Arctic and around the world could
increase by one third.]{.underline}

[Because wildfires combust organic soil and biomass, they also release
huge quantities of carbon. In 2021, Arctic wildfires accounted for a
third of the worldwide wildfire CO2 emissions. In addition to releasing
CO2, wildfires emit methane and black carbon as well as smoke and soot
that affects air quality and pollution levels, which negatively affects
the health of local communities.]{.underline}

A bigger problem hiding beneath the surface

More than 66 per cent of Arctic settlements are built on permafrost,
ground that has remained below zero degrees Celsius for at least two
years. Over thousands of years, [dead plants and animals have
accumulated in these permanently frozen soils and sediments creating
1035 gigatonnes of carbon]{.underline}. According to the Special Report
on the Oceans and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate, many parts of the
Arctic are experiencing record high temperatures in permafrost due to
the climate crisis, which is contributing to permafrost thaw.

[Permafrost thaw generally occurs gradually, but]{.underline}
disturbances like [wildfires can also trigger and accelerate
it]{.underline}. These fires destroy the soil's insulating layer, which
can cause microbes in the permafrost to come out of hibernation and
break down organic carbon in the soil, releasing CO2 and methane. [Once
large-scale thawing of Arctic permafrost is triggered, carbon release
could be unstoppable and irreversible.]{.underline}

[Permafrost thaw is one of the gravest yet lesser discussed impacts of
climate change]{.underline}. [**Permafrost covers 24 percent of the
surface of land** masses in the northern hemisphere and **accounts for
nearly half of all organic carbon stored** within the planet's
soil]{.underline}. As long as this organic matter remains frozen, it
will stay trapped in the permafrost. However, [if it thaws, microbes
will begin to eat the material, causing it to decay and releasing carbon
dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. Even if a small fraction of
these greenhouse gases are released, it will have **major consequences**
on not only the Arctic, but Earth's entire climate system, as they
intensify global climate change.]{.underline}

[**Permafrost temperatures are rising at a much faster rate** than the
temperature of the air in the Arctic, and **have risen between 1.5 to
2.5 degrees** Celsius in the **last 30 years**]{.underline}. As a
result, permafrost layers are melting. [A **3 degree Celsius increase in
global temperatures could melt 30 to 85 percent** **of the top
permafrost layers** that exist across the Arctic region, destroying

The Impact of Permafrost Thaw

In recent years, **[permafrost thaw]{.underline}** has become a salient
and pervasive threat that touches life in all corners of the Arctic, and
[**impacts** the wellbeing of Arctic residents, **ecosystems**,
economies, and **planetary health** in four key ways: erosion,
destabilizing landscapes and buildings, flooding hazards and forced
migration, and diseases]{.underline}. Furthermore, [contending with
permafrost thaw is especially difficult]{.underline}, as it is
influenced by global processes of warming and this is hard to change and
control in a short period of time. Combating permafrost thaw will take a
concerted effort from people and states across the world, as this
problem clearly extends beyond the boundaries of the Arctic.

[The **Arctic is warming more than two times faster than the global
average**]{.underline}. Permafrost thaw [contributes to a **positive
feedback loop** that further accelerates the warming of Earth,
**releasing methane,** which is a more powerful greenhouse gas than
**carbon**, directly into the atmosphere,]{.underline} and contributing
to the spread of devastating Arctic wildfires. Though its lifespan in
the atmosphere is much shorter than carbon dioxide, [**methane's
impact** on climate change has been found to be **25 times greater**
over a 100-year period]{.underline}. [While the Arctic was **previously
considered a carbon sink**, new research shows that the region is
**emitting more carbon than it is absorbing**, largely due to permafrost
thaw]{.underline}. [It is estimated that the world's permafrost contains
up to **1,700 billion tonnes of carbon**, which is almost **double the
amount of carbon in the Earth's atmosphere**, and **four times** more
than what has already been **emitted** by humans as **since the
Industrial Revolution**]{.underline}. [If all permafrost were degraded
to the point of decomposing, the **disastrous effects** would be felt
all over the world.]{.underline}

from people and states across the world, as this problem clearly extends
beyond the boundaries of the Arctic.

The Arctic is warming more than two times faster than the global
average. Permafrost thaw contributes to a positive feedback loop that
further accelerates the warming of Earth, releasing methane, which is a
more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon, directly into the atmosphere,
and contributing to the spread of devastating Arctic wildfires. Though
its lifespan in the atmosphere is much shorter than carbon dioxide,
methane's impact on climate change has been found to be 25 times greater
over a 100-year period. While the Arctic was previously considered a
carbon sink, new research shows that the region is emitting more carbon
than it is absorbing, largely due to permafrost thaw. It is estimated
that the world's permafrost contains up to 1,700 billion tonnes of
carbon, which is almost double the amount of carbon in the Earth's
atmosphere, and four times more than what has already been emitted by
humans as since the Industrial Revolution. [If all permafrost were
degraded to the point of decomposing, the **disastrous effects** would
be felt **all over the world**.]{.underline}

[We are already seeing the direct effects of permafrost
thaw]{.underline}. In the world's most remote corners, shorelines are
receding at alarming rates. Permafrost thaw works in tandem with reduced
Arctic sea ice. Normally, the ice acts as a wave-break along the Arctic
coastline, protecting the land from storms. But with longer ice-free
periods and coastal earth that is already softer than normal due to the
melt, a single storm can erode up to 20 meters of shoreline. Arctic
coastlines have seen an average erosion rate of nearly half a meter per
year over the last fifty years. Experts estimate that some **[Arctic
islands]{.underline}**, particularly in northern Russia, [may soon be
**washed into the sea**.]{.underline} In Alaska and the Canadian north,
dozens of [**people have been displaced** as the ocean edges ever closer
to their towns and homes, often leaving houses teetering on the edge of
the North American continent]{.underline}.

[**Permafrost thaw** also **destabilizes the ground above** it,
**damaging critical infrastructure**, causing **unprecedented
flooding**, and **displacing entire communities**]{.underline}. Soil
that was once frozen year-round is now thawing and refreezing each year.
When the ground thaws, the soil contracts and sinks, and when it freezes
again it expands and rises. [This continuous cycle shifts, displaces,
and breaks whatever lies above it -- **roads, railroad tracks, pipes,
buildings, and more**. **In many** Russian **Arctic cities, more than
half of the buildings have been damaged by the shifting earth**, and the
stability of entire cities is at risk.]{.underline} In remote Russian
regions, scientists have discovered [**massive craters** that they
believe are being **caused by methane eruptions** from thawing
permafrost]{.underline}. Meanwhile, in the Canadian Arctic, [**damage to
infrastructure has caused a housing shortage**, leading to a **spike in
rent rates** and driving them higher than some of the world's **most
expensive** cities.]{.underline}

[Furthermore, **permafrost thaw is turning previously frozen earth into
ponds and swamps**, the emergence of which continues to accelerate the
melting process.]{.underline} This transformation from solid ground to
porous ponds has increased flooding for communities across the North
American and Russian Arctic. Indigenous peoples who reside in the Arctic
are particularly affected, and have seen their ancestral lands and
burial grounds washed away. Indigenous lifestyles, economies, food
security, and customs are threatened as well, as changing ecosystems
disrupt familiar natural patterns, and the melting ground destroys ice
cellars, which are a key part in Indigenous subsistence lifestyles.
Instead of storing food in the frozen ground for months, a strategy that
has been practiced for thousands of years, community food stocks are now
at risk of rotting, [**creating further food insecurity** in an already
at-risk area]{.underline}. In Scandinavia, reindeer herders are facing
difficulties as the ground shifts and new bodies of water appear in
places where they didn't exist previously. [Many Arctic Indigenous
communities also face displacement from their traditional homelands.
**In Alaska, more than 30 communities face an imminent risk** of
displacement and need for relocation away from erosion and floods -- an
endeavour that **costs millions of dollars** and further contributes to
housing insecurity in the region]{.underline}. In Russia, villages are
usually not moved, and Indigenous residents are often forced to relocate
to cities -- a jarring and traumatic experience for people who have
lived off the land for generations. Such forced migrations from rural
villages to urban agglomerations strains intergenerational knowledge,
language, and traditions exchange that have already been damaged by
discriminatory policies.

Finally, experts are studying how [thawing permafrost may lead to the
**reemergence of harmful bacteria and diseases** that have been **frozen
in the earth for hundreds of years** and could **harm Arctic
ecosystems**.]{.underline} An instance of this has [already been **seen
in 2016**, when an anthrax **outbreak** from a rotting animal carcass
**found in** the **permafrost** caused over 70 people to be
**hospitalized** in northern Russia, and **killed** a child and more
than **2,300** reindeer.]{.underline}

[The effects of permafrost degradation are **not** only **contained
within the Arctic, but threaten to spill across boundaries and affect
people beyond** the region. Permafrost thaw contributes to the release
of powerful greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and contributes to
massive wildfires, which **affect air quality** levels in places
thousands of miles away.]{.underline}

#### Permafrost Melt causes destruction to arctic communities, supply chains, and infrastructure

warn., No Publication,

2025 MAR 31 (VerticalNews) \-- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at
Global Warming Focus \-- The [Arctic **permafrost thaw** is **hazardous
to the livelihood, safety, health, food security, and the infrastructure
of communities** living in Arctic regions, an international group of
scientists have warned.]{.underline}

In a comparative interdisciplinary study, the scientists analyze four
arctic regions, one in each of Russia, Canada, Norway and Greenland, to
identify and assess the key hazards of permafrost thaw.

Their findings, published in the journal Communications Earth and
Environment, show that [due to the melting of ice in their soil, the
four **Arctic regions suffer** from infrastructure failure,
**disruptions to mobility and supply chains**, **declining water
quality, food security challenges**, and **increased exposure to
diseases and contaminants.**]{.underline}

They write, \"Since our study areas represent perspectives from a range
of human and natural Arctic permafrost settings, the framework and risk
assessment we present here are applicable to other (continuous)
[permafrost regions experiencing similar **hazards and impacts**,
thereby supporting the development of overarching adaptation and
mitigation strategies]{.underline}.\"

The study is something of a novelty as the scientists adopt a
comparative approach that spans a variety of disciplines, and
environmental and societal contexts, with a transdisciplinary synthesis
that takes various risk perceptions into account.

Adding weight to the findings is the fact that the research is the fruit
of a consortium-based collaborative effort with contributions from the
world\'s leading institutions in climate change research.

Climate change is blamed for the erratic and long-term shifts in the
Earth\'s weather and temperature with scientists reporting a world that
has been warming up quickly in the past decades.

The Earth\'s warming is behind the permafrost thaw - a process which
refers to the melting of the ice in the frosty soil of Arctic regions. A
thawing permafrost can have grave consequences on the environment and
the inhabitants as the frozen soil melts.

\"Climate change is accelerating [Arctic permafrost thaw, posing
**significant risks to** both the environment and **human
communities,\"**]{.underline} said Dr. Khaled Abbas, University of
Sharjah\'s associate professor in environmental health sciences and a
co-author. \"[This research examines these threats, focusing on the
growing concerns associated with permafrost degradation and human
activity.\"]{.underline}

Through a risk analysis framework that integrates both environmental and
societal perspectives, the [study provides valuable insights into how
climate change drives permafrost degradation and its cascading effects
on Arctic communities.]{.underline} At the same time, it proposes
strategies for mitigation and adaptation, aiming to enhance resilience
in affected regions.

\"The research underscores the critical role of interdisciplinary
collaboration in tackling these complex challenges. By bringing together
experts from environmental science, public health, engineering, and
policy, the study offers a comprehensive understanding of how permafrost
thaw impacts not only Arctic communities but also global populations,\"
Dr. Abbas maintains.

The [authors\' findings emphasize that climate change is not just a
regional issue confined to the Arctic but a global crisis with
far-reaching consequences]{.underline}. \"[Permafrost thaw poses diverse
risks to Arctic environments and livelihoods. Understanding the
**effects of permafrost thaw is vital for informed policy**making and
adaptation effort]{.underline}s,\" says Dr. Abass. \"Our findings show
that permafrost thaw is not only an environmental issue but also a
direct challenge to the safety, health, and well-being of Arctic
communities.\"

The authors pursue an inter- and transdisciplinary risk analysis based
on multidirectional knowledge exchanges and thematic network analysis.
They underscore the vital role of permafrost within Arctic ecosystems
and highlight the main risks associated with its vulnerability to
climate change.

They assess permafrost risks in the four regions they have studied \"by
characterizing the relationships between the physical processes, key
hazards, and societal consequences on life domains via thematic network
analysis and how each of these relationships was perceived across the
four case studies.\"

[Their description of the risks from permafrost thaw across the four
regions is five-pronged with the failure in infrastructure cited as the
first hazard \"resulting in adverse consequences]{.underline} for
[**costs and economy, planning and fate control, and health and
well-being**.\"]{.underline}

The second hazard, according to the scientists, relates to
\"[disruptions of mobility and supplies, often created by ground
instabilities and erosion, impact costs and the economy, as well as
recreation and being in nature.\"]{.underline}

The third risk emanates from ground instability [the permafrost thaw
causes as the ice in the soil melts which \"affects health and
well-being as well as costs and the economy.\"]{.underline}

The fourth hazard the authors attribute to the changes in flora and
fauna and hydrological and biochemical cycles which pose \"challenges
for food security \... \[and\] consequences for local costs and the
economy as well as culture and language.\"

[Finally, the study dwells on the health and well-being of communities
inhabiting these regions. It shows that the thawing of permafrost
exposes these communities \"to infectious diseases and
contaminants]{.underline} \... driven by changes in climate and weather
conditions \... which creates concerns for human and ecosystem health\".

Dr. Abass says the study is a wake-up call for the world that climate
change is causing [Arctic permafrost to thaw, leading to severe
environmental and societal challenges.]{.underline} \"This research
underscores the urgent need for improved planning and adaptation
strategies to help Arctic communities navigate these growing threats.
[As the frozen ground warms, **roads, houses, and infrastructure are
collapsing**, **disrupting transportation** and access to essential
supplies.]{.underline}

\"[**Water sources are becoming polluted**, while **food security** is
at risk due to changes in hunting and fishing patterns. Additionally,
thawing permafrost is releasing long-trapped pollutants and potentially
harmful bacteria and viruses, creating new **health
risks.\"**]{.underline}

The research is of implications for policymakers, environmental
agencies, and industries involved in infrastructure and resource
management, affirms Dr. Abass, adding. \"[Organizations focused on
climate adaptation, indigenous community development, and sustainable
governance may find the study highly relevant.]{.underline}

\"This study provides critical information for governments and
policymakers to develop climate adaptation strategies in Arctic regions
and beyond. It emphasizes the [need for improved urban planning,
infrastructure reinforcement, and sustainable resource
management.]{.underline} The research also highlights the urgency of
preparing for [permafrost thaw\'s consequences on ecosystems and human
livelihoods.\"]{.underline}

#### Wildfire are expanding and destructive

**WWF 23** (World Wildlife Foundation, QUALS, 7-24-2023, Arctic
connected, WWF Arctic \| Wildfires are devastating the Arctic,
https://www.arcticwwf.org/newsroom/features/arctic-connected-wildfires-are-devastating-the-arctic/,
7-16-2025) //dax

[Wildfires triggered by natural causes such as lightning, or by human
activity, are raging across the Arctic at rates never seen
before]{.underline}. While wildfires have always been a natural part of
Arctic boreal forest and tundra ecosystems---some pine trees even rely
on the heat from these fires to open their cones and disperse
seeds---rising temperatures have [increased their frequency and scale.
In fact, northern forests are experiencing larger fires than in
mid-latitudes further south]{.underline}.

Boreal forests in northern Canada, Alaska and Russia provide an
important carbon sink. Their [deciduous trees and conifers absorb carbon
dioxide, a major contributor to global warming and climate
change]{.underline}. But this function is being undermined as wildfires
sweep across through parts of the Arctic such as Alaska and Siberia.

[Wildfires are contributing to the climate crisis]{.underline}

In the summer of 2022, [more than 12,000 square kilometers across Alaska
were destroyed by wildfires]{.underline}---that's roughly triple the
annual average. The year before, [more than 165,000 square kilometres of
Siberian forest was destroyed, an area roughly twice the size of
Austria]{.underline}. And in 2018, fires burned 810 square kilometers of
critical reindeer pasture in Sweden.

These fires are being fueled by extreme weather events like droughts,
heatwaves, and lightning strikes---all of which are a direct result of
climate change. But "zombie fires" are also on the rise in parts of
Alaska and Canada. [These are fires that come back to life and reignite
in the spring when the weather warms up,]{.underline} after sitting
dormant for eight or nine months in wet, sub-zero weather. [By 2050, it
is estimated that wildfires in the Arctic and around the world could
increase by one third.]{.underline}

Because wildfires combust organic soil and biomass, they also release
huge quantities of carbon. In 2021, Arctic wildfires accounted for a
third of the worldwide wildfire CO2 emissions. [In addition to releasing
CO2, wildfires emit methane and black carbon as well as smoke and soot
that affects air quality and pollution levels, which negatively affects
the health of local communities.]{.underline}

#### Fires independently, cause damage in addition to causing permafrost thaw

**WWF 23** (World Wildlife Foundation, QUALS, 7-24-2023, Arctic
connected, WWF Arctic \| Wildfires are devastating the Arctic,
https://www.arcticwwf.org/newsroom/features/arctic-connected-wildfires-are-devastating-the-arctic/,
7-16-2025) //dax

[A bigger problem hiding beneath the surface]{.underline}

[More than 66 per cent of Arctic settlements are built on permafrost,
ground that has remained below zero degrees Celsius for at least two
years. Over thousands of years, dead plants and animals have accumulated
in these permanently frozen soils and sediments creating 1035 gigatonnes
of carbon]{.underline}. According to the Special Report on the Oceans
and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate, many parts of the Arctic are
experiencing record high temperatures in permafrost due to the climate
crisis, which is contributing to permafrost thaw.

[Permafrost thaw generally occurs gradually, but disturbances like
**wildfires can also trigger and accelerate it.**]{.underline} [These
fires destroy the soil's insulating layer, which can cause microbes in
the permafrost to come out of hibernation and break down organic carbon
in the soil, releasing CO2 and methane. Once large-scale thawing of
Arctic permafrost is triggered, carbon release could be unstoppable and
irreversible.]{.underline}

The increase in carbon emissions caused by permafrost thaw---occurring
because of the climate crisis and being exacerbated by wildfires---has
been [disregarded in climate models.]{.underline} But it is a clear
threat to keeping global carbon budgets within the Paris Climate
Agreement's 1.5 degree goal.

It is time to find ways to fix the problem

In the Arctic, wildfires are threatening the habitats of ecologically
important species such as caribou, and reindeer. Other [impacts include
risks to life and property, economic costs, health effects, and public
anxiety and stress. And many ecosystems and communities are already
struggling.]{.underline}

[If we do not take immediate action to address the climate crisis by
reducing carbon emissions we will continue to witness more extreme
wildfires and weather events around the world. Governments and
institutions must both agree to stop global warming and take steps to
protect infrastructure and human life from wildfires]{.underline}. [We
must also work together to overcome challenges in securing the funding,
skills, and institutional support needed to engage in the planning for a
new Arctic.]{.underline}

In order to lessen the impacts of wildfires and extreme weather events,
it is time to close the gap between talk and action---and put a stop to
global warming and reverse nature loss by 2030. Only by taking urgent
action now we will be able to reduce the risks.

#### Continued warming melts permafrost and puts critical infrastructure at risk.

[[Infrastructure built on]{.mark} perennially [frozen ice]{.mark}-rich
ground [relies]{.mark} heavily [on thermally stable subsurface
conditions]{.mark}. Climate-[warming]{.mark}-induced deepening [of
ground]{.mark} thaw [puts]{.mark} such [infrastructure at risk of
failure]{.mark}. [For]{.mark} better [assessing the risk of]{.mark}
large-scale [future damage to Arctic infrastructure]{.mark}, **[improved
strategies for model-based approaches are urgently
needed.]{.mark}**]{.underline} We used the laterally coupled 1D heat
conduction model CryoGrid3 to simulate permafrost degradation affected
by linear infrastructure. We present a case study of a gravel road built
on continuous permafrost (Dalton highway, Alaska) and forced our model
under historical and strong future warming conditions (following the
RCP8.5 scenario). As expected, the presence of a gravel road in the
model leads to higher net heat flux entering the ground compared to a
reference run without infrastructure and thus a higher rate of thaw.
Further, our results suggest that road failure is likely a consequence
of lateral destabilization due to talik formation in the ground beside
the road rather than a direct consequence of a top-down thawing and
deepening of the active layer below the road centre. In line with
previous studies, we identify enhanced snow accumulation and ponding
(both a consequence of infrastructure presence) as key factors for
increased soil temperatures and road degradation. Using differing
horizontal model resolutions, we show that it is possible to capture
these key factors and their impact on thawing dynamics with a low number
of lateral model units, underlining the potential of our model approach
for use in pan-Arctic risk assessments. [Our [results suggest]{.mark} a
general two-phase behavior of permafrost degradation: an initial phase
of slow and gradual thaw, followed by [**a strong increase in thawing
rates after the exceedance of a critical ground
warming**.]{.mark}]{.underline} The timing of this transition and the
magnitude of thaw rate acceleration differ strongly between undisturbed
tundra and infrastructure-affected permafrost ground. Our model results
suggest that current model-based approaches which do not explicitly take
into account infrastructure in their designs are likely to strongly
underestimate the timing of future Arctic infrastructure failure. By
using a laterally coupled 1D model to simulate linear infrastructure, we
infer results in line with outcomes from more complex 2D and 3D models,
but our model\'s computational efficiency allows us to account for
long-term climate change impacts on infrastructure from permafrost
degradation[. Our [model simulations underline that it is crucial to
consider]{.mark} climate [warming when planning]{.mark} and constructing
[infrastructure on permafrost as]{.mark} a transition from a stable to a
[highly unstable infrastructure]{.mark} state [can]{.mark} well
[occur]{.mark} [within]{.mark} [the service lifetime]{.mark} (about 30
years) of such a construction]{.underline}. [Such a transition can even
be triggered in the coming decade by climate change for infrastructure
built on high northern latitude continuous permafrost that displays cold
and relatively stable conditions today]{.underline}.

Permafrost Thaw in the Warming Arctic: Final Remarks

[**Siberia**, like much of the world, had a year like no
other]{.underline}. Stories about an [**unprecedented six-month
heatwave** and raging wildfires throughout Russia's Northern
regions]{.underline} filtered into the mainstream media. These alarming
headlines reminded the world that climate change and its effects are
being felt now, especially in the Far North. The [Arctic]{.underline},
which is [warming]{.underline} at least [**two times faster** than the
rest of the world]{.underline}, is a [harbinger **signaling dire
consequences** if we cannot keep global warming below **1.5 degrees
Celsius**]{.underline}.1) Hidden underneath these extreme events is a
quieter but no less pressing [threat]{.underline} that could prevent us
from meeting that goal; one that may prove [pivotal]{.underline} if we
hope [to curb global carbon emissions: **thawing
permafrost**.]{.underline}

In order to be considered [permafrost]{.underline}, the ground must
[remain]{.underline} at or below [freezing for at least two consecutive
years]{.underline}.2) It traditionally [acts as a "**carbon sink**,"
where carbon has been captured and stored. Scientists estimate that this
layer contains approximately **1,400 gigatons** of frozen carbon, the
equivalent of **four times** the amount **humans** have emitted since
the Industrial Revolution and **two times** as much as is **currently**
**contained** in the environment.3) If this captured carbon were allowed
to escape into the atmosphere, it would contribute to]{.underline} what
may already be [a **runaway greenhouse effect** that could render even
the **most ambitious** attempts to cut global emissions **ineffective**.
Essentially, we could make **every necessary sacrifice** and still see
global temperatures rise above 1.5 degrees Celsius if the Arctic becomes
a major carbon source instead of remaining a carbon sink]{.underline}. A
recent NASA-funded study suggests that this shift is already happening
due to winter soil emissions. According to Sue Natali of the Woods Hole
Research Center, carbon emissions at individual sites are surpassing
carbon uptake. It remains to be seen if this transition is occurring
throughout the entire Arctic region. This development makes
understanding and incorporating permafrost thaw emissions into the
global carbon budget even more pressing.4)

Despite the potential ramifications of emissions from permafrost thaw,
[the **global carbon budget**, which balances the carbon dioxide (CO2)
output from human activities with the input or storage in carbon sinks,
does **not fully** **incorporate** this emission source]{.underline}.5)
Ensuring that permafrost thaw is included in this calculation is
critical in making our current goals reachable. Fortunately, the recent
events in Siberia are bringing a new level of awareness to the [leading
role]{.underline} that [permafrost will play in]{.underline} our future
[**success or failure** in staying below 1.5 degrees of
warming.]{.underline} In examining these events, we can better
understand the relationship between extreme weather, its impact on
permafrost, and the consequences if the international community fails to
account for this looming threat.

The six-month heatwave in Siberia contributed to raising the world's
average temperature to the hottest on record.6) [From January through
the end of June, Siberia was subjected to record high temperatures. One
of the world's **coldest towns,** Verkhoyansk, saw **100-degree
days**]{.underline}.7) According to Zeke Hausfather, the Director of
Climate and Energy at the Breakthrough Institute in Oakland, California,
Siberia's temperatures were "extreme no matter how you look at them."8).
These [temperatures]{.underline} concerned scientists because of their
[potential to **increase the rate of thaw** in the Arctic. High,
prolonged temperatures melt more ice and snow, which expose the **darker
sub-layers.** Without the layer of white snow and the **protective
albedo effect** it provides, the soil begins to **thaw**. This, in turn,
exposes more dark soil, which leads to further melting and so on. As the
thaw moves deeper into the soil, **nutrients are released**, allowing
plants and shrubs to grow, darkening the surface even more. As this
**positive, self-reinforcing feedback** continues, more CO2 is emitted.
Carbon dioxide is a significant contributor to global warming, resulting
in more **extreme weather** and other climate events that amplify the
cycle. Scientists fear that these local feedback loops will contribute
to a **global loop** with **disastrous, irreversible**
consequences.]{.underline} Unfortunately, high temperatures have also
led to other devastating events in the Arctic.

In Siberia, these protracted, unusually [high temperatures]{.underline}
have [result]{.underline}ed [in]{.underline} conditions that have
contributed to [**extreme wildfire**s. According to the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's Earth Observatory, Siberia's 2020
fire season **released more carbon dioxide in June and July than any
other fire season since 2003**.9) These wildfires burn **off the**
**organic layers** of moss and other decomposing plants that form on top
of permafrost-affected soils. That organic matter typically acts as a
**blanket** in the summertime to keep the darker, deeper soil insulated
from the heat of the sun. However, the deeper layers of permafrost,
having already thawed more than usual during the winter months from a
reduced albedo effect, are now **more susceptible to thaw** in layers
that would typically stay frozen even in the summer months. When
**wildfires burn off** that summertime insulation, the initial loss of
insulating materials kicks off a sequence of **local feedback loops,
amplifying** permafrost thaw.]{.underline}10) Dr. Charles Koven, an
Earth System Scientist for the University of California, Berkeley, notes
that the permafrost research community's [ability to incorporate extreme
events like wildfires into their climate models is limited]{.underline}.
However, [there is]{.underline} also a [basic agreement]{.underline}
that "there is a possibility that these [extreme events]{.underline} are
**[amplify]{.underline}**ing [and speed]{.underline}ing [up
things]{.underline}."

There is a [growing **consensus** among scientists and policymakers that
this critical emissions source needs to be better
represented]{.underline} in our climate models. Many in the permafrost
research community, those who have been studying it and speaking up
about it for years, worry that despite our best efforts and sacrifices,
[we may **not be able** to keep global warming below the goal of 1.5
degrees **unless we consider these** **feedback loops.**]{.underline}
Dr. Koven estimates that about 100 gigatons of CO2 will need to be
subtracted from the current global carbon budget to account for these
emissions. While there is still significant uncertainty concerning the
amount of CO2 held in permafrost, [the impact of extreme events, and the
rate of thaw]{.underline}, it [is vital that the international community
not ignore the situation]{.underline} until the models are improved.
With permafrost thaw incorporated into the global carbon budget,
policymakers will be better able to make decisions based on a more
realistic picture of the actions countries will need to take to meet
their carbon emission goals. Even so, including estimated emissions from
permafrost thaw will just be the first step. Ongoing international
cooperation will be essential in developing more effective observation
networks and funding additional research in this critical area.

[Potential area burned by wildfire]{.underline} could increase by 25% to
53% by 2100. This could affect, for example, forage for caribou and
shifting competition between caribou and moose, with likely detriments
to subsistence users of caribou.83

The IPCC special report on the cryosphere also found that On Arctic
land, a loss of globally unique biodiversity is projected as limited
refugia exist for some High-Arctic species and hence they are
outcompeted by more temperate species (medium confidence).84

It identified negative impacts also on food and water security in the
Arctic, "[disrupt]{.underline}\[ing\] [access to, and food
availability]{.underline} within, herding, hunting, fishing, and
gathering areas, harming the livelihoods and cultural identity of Arctic
residents including Indigenous populations."85 More broadly, warming and
ecosystem shifts have "[increase]{.underline}d [risk of]{.underline}
food- and [waterborne diseases, malnutrition, injury, and mental health
challenges especially among Indigenous peoples]{.underline}."86

Few studies have investigated [the potential economic
effects]{.underline} of the array of physical impacts. [A
report]{.underline} for the state of Alaska [on the economic effects of
climate change estimated that]{.underline} five relatively certain,
large [effects]{.underline} that could be readily quantified [would
impose an annual net cost of]{.underline} \$340**--**[\$700 million, or

large regional disparities]{.underline}, as rural communities face large
projected costs while more southerly urban residents experience net
gains.87 The research did not consider "nonuse" impacts, such as on
culture, subsistence harvests, or other nonmarket values, as well as
additional sectors, such as military installations, housing, and others.

[Another study estimating the effects of climate change on Alaskan
infrastructure found]{.underline} "[cumulative estimated expenses from

climate scenario\] and \$4.2 billion for RCP4.5 \[a moderate climate
scenario\], suggesting that reducing greenhouse gas emissions could
lessen damages by \$1.3 billion this century."88 [Costs were mostly due
to road flooding and permafrost instability, and mostly in the interior

measures could mostly reduce or entirely avoid the [estimated economic

high spatial resolution and an assessment of how changes in circumpolar
permafrost conditions could affect infrastructure]{.underline}1,14.
Owing to the increasing economic and environmental relevance of the
Arctic1,5,10, [it is]{.underline} of a [vital importance to gain
detailed knowledge about risk exposure in areas of current and future
infrastructure]{.underline}8,9,10,11,12,13,14,18. The aim of this study
was to first, map infrastructure hazard areas in the Northern
Hemisphere's permafrost regions at unprecedentedly high (\~1 km) spatial
resolution under projected climatic changes and second, quantify the
amount and proportion of engineering structures in areas where ground
subsidence and loss of structural bearing capacity could damage
infrastructure by 2050.

Standardized in-situ observations of ground temperature and thaw depth,
geospatial environmental data, and ensemble methodologies22 were used to
model the current and future ground thermal regime in the Northern
Hemisphere's permafrost domain23 (Methods). In the ensemble forecasting,
the observations of ground thermal regime were related to physically
relevant environmental variables using four statistical techniques at 30
arc-second resolution. The ensemble model provided accurate predictions
of the observed ground temperatures retrospectively, indicating
potential for good performance in prognostic studies23. [The focus was
on thaw of near-surface permafrost]{.underline} (\<15 m depth) [owing to
its central role for infrastructure]{.underline} (defined here as
facilities with permanent foundations on ice-free land)
[hazards]{.underline}1,8,9,13,14. Future conditions were considered
using Representative Concentration Pathways24 (RCPs) 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5
for 2041--2060 and 2061--2080. Near-surface permafrost was considered to
thaw when mean annual ground temperature (MAGT) at or near (the closest
to) the depth of zero annual amplitude changed from ≤0 °C to \>0 °C
between the baseline (2000--2014) and future period. [In an engineering
context, the selected threshold is conservative because
infrastructure]{.underline} (e.g., buildings) [could experience thaw
settlements and failure before the thaw of near-surface
permafrost]{.underline}. However, a conservative threshold is justified
considering the use of statistically based methodology in modelling of
the ground thermal regime (Methods). In the results, we focus on medium
stabilization scenario RCP4.5 (total radiative forcing is stabilized
shortly after 2100)25 for 2041--2060 (hereafter 2050). This period was
chosen acknowledging the relatively short lifespan (often 20--50 years)
of infrastructure in the Arctic12,13. Thus our analyses, conducted at
unprecedentedly high spatial resolution[, are useful for indicating
near-future at-risk areas owing to the degradation]{.underline} (i.e.
warming and thaw) [of permafrost]{.underline}.

\[\*371\]

I. Introduction

Migration of animal species, defined as the periodic movement between
two sites, 1 has been well recognized for millennia and subject to
intense \[\*372\] scientific interest for over 150 years. Most
scientific attention has been focused on the physiology, behavior, or
population dynamics of particular migratory species. 2 Yet like all
species, [**migratory** species are **members** of ecological
systems]{.underline} (ecosystems) - assemblages of plants, animals, and
microbes [that **interact** with one **another** and with the
**physical** and **chemical** environment. The capture]{.underline} and
transformation [of **energy** and **nutrients** by organisms within
ecosystems, through]{.underline} photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation,
feeding, defecation, [**pollination**, and decomposition]{.underline}
among myriad other processes and activities, [results in an **array** of
life-supporting goods and services without which **human life** could
**not** be **sustained**]{.underline}. 3 [Food, fiber, and
timber]{.underline} production; recreational and aesthetic experiences;
the provision of [life-saving **drugs** and other **pharmaceuticals**;
and the supply of fresh **air** and **water** are]{.underline} just a
few of the ecosystem services [provided by **nature\'s** \"green
infrastructure.\"]{.underline} 4 The activities of organisms in
ecosystems can also result in disservices to humans, such as sustaining
and spreading pests and disease.

From this ecological perspective, migratory species are of interest as
components of two or more ecosystems and vectors for energy and matter
transfer between them. The distance and frequency that migratory species
travel in space and time can vary widely, from the diurnal movements of
tiny krill (e.g., Euphausia superba) through a few hundred vertical feet
of ocean water 5 to the annual circumpolar navigations of Arctic Terns
(Sterna paradisaea). 6 Despite these differences in scale, all migratory
species share the distinction of being regular participants in multiple
ecosystems encountered throughout the migration route.

An important rationale for the conservation of species, including
migratory species, is rarity. [Rare species are more **likely** to go
**extinct** because of]{.underline} demographic fluctuations or [loss of
critical **habitat**]{.underline}. 7 However, the ecosystem services
provided by species may be a positive function of their abundance, such
that the greater the number of individuals the greater \[\*373\] amount
of ecosystem services they provide. 8 Animal migrations provide
especially clear examples of this relationship because they are often
phenomena of abundance 9 and their periodic and often discrete nature
facilitates measurement of species effects. For example, the more salmon
migrate upstream to their spawning grounds, the more marine [nutrients
are **transported** inland to **fertilize** stream and forest
ecosystems]{.underline}. 10 Likewise, the larger a population of
migratory pollinators, the more plants will be pollinated. 11 Thus,
valuation of migratory species based on their capacity to provide
ecosystem services may be the inverse of their valuation based on
rarity. This represents an alternative paradigm to rarity-based
[conservation]{.underline} and instead [provides a strong **rationale**
for conserving and **protecting** abundant **migratory** species because
of the **magnitude** of their ecosystem **services**.]{.underline}

Using the framework of ecosystem services and disservices our focus here
is to consider the functional roles of migratory species as members of
multiple ecosystems and to highlight novel implications for conservation
policy that arise from this functional perspective. In Part II, we
discuss the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment framework for ecosystem
services and provide examples of the ecosystem services and disservices
of migrating species. In Part III, we present case studies in order to
explore more fully the services and disservices of migratory species and
their relationship to abundance. In Part IV, we consider the
implications that a functional perspective brings to conservation
policy, with special attention to migratory species.

II\. Overview

Ecosystem [services are the **life-supporting**]{.underline} and
life-enhancing [benefits provided to **people** by the world\'s
**ecosystems**]{.underline}, 12 or \"natural capital.\" 13 \[\*374\]
Animals provide a variety of important ecosystem services with direct
economic benefits to humans. For example, coffee, one of the world\'s
most important export commodities, is highly dependent on pollination by
natural insect populations. 14 An estimated one-third of global crop
production is dependent on wild animal pollinators. 15 The economic
value of commercial plus wild pollinator services is estimated to be \$
100-\$ 200 billion annually on a global basis. 16 [Food **production**
from wild]{.underline} marine [systems]{.underline} (overwhelmingly
animal based) was estimated to have an annual worth of nearly one
trillion dollars per year. 17

[[For many migratory bird]{.mark} [s]{.mark}pecies, [Alaska is the
northern apex of an annual migration]{.mark}. It is a place where birds
travel each year, where they can rely on abundant food resources and
diverse habitats in which to rest, refuel, find a mate, make their nest,

Just as headwaters represent the source of rivers and streams**[[,
Alaska is where abundant bird life originates and flows outward across
the globe]{.underline}]{.mark}**. More specifically[[, it plays a unique
and vital role in the annual journey of migratory birds, serving as the
"headwaters" of the Pacific, West Pacific, Midcontinent / Mississippi,
Atlantic, and parts of the East Asian-Australasian
Flyways.]{.underline}]{.mark} These flyways are vast highways in the sky
that birds use to travel between breeding and nonbreeding areas. These
important corridors are shaped by geography, wind patterns, food
availability, and stopover sites.

'**[[Loss of species is an existential threat to
humans']{.underline}]{.mark}** -- UP academics respond to UN extinction
report

Wild spaces and the animals in them are disappearing at an alarming
rate, according to the recent United Nations (UN) report on the
extinction of species.

"What [[many fail to realise]{.mark}]{.underline} is that [[the current
loss of species]{.mark} and increasingly]{.underline} pervasive damage
to the global environment [[impacts us severely]{.underline}]{.mark},
being nothing short of **[[an existential threat to
humans]{.underline}]{.mark}**," [[says Prof Andrew
McKechnie,]{.underline}]{.mark} [of the Department of Zoology and
Entomology and the South African Research Chair in Conversation
Physiology at the National Zoological Gardens.]{.underline}

Published by the UN's Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on
Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services**[[, the report was compiled by 145
experts from 50 countries, and is the most comprehensive of its
kind]{.underline}]{.mark}** yet. It states that one million animal and
plant species are threatened with extinction -- in fact, many will
disappear within decades -- and that the current global response to this
crisis is insufficient.

This is not just an environmental issue either; it's a developmental,
economic, security, social and moral one: the loss of biodiversity and
ecosystems will aggravate poverty, hunger and sickness; water will
become increasingly unusable; and temperatures will continue to rise.

While the report states [[that it is not too late to avert the impending
collapse of natural systems,]{.mark}]{.underline} "transformative
change" is needed to restore and protect what has already been damaged.
Rehabilitating the environment, using nature sustainably and slowing the
rate at which the planet is warming require a fundamental shift in
priorities.

"The global economy needs to change from encouraging short-term growth
and profits to ensuring long-term sustainability and environmental
health," says Prof McKechnie, who also holds the Research Chair in
Conservation Physiology at the National Zoological Gardens of South
Africa. This shift is not only vital for the environment but is key to
the well-being of humans and to meeting many of the UN's Sustainable
Development Goals that relate to poverty, hunger, health, water, cities,
climate, oceans and land.

Although eight European countries have recognised the state of danger
that we are in -- calling for 25 percent of the European Union budget to
be allocated to addressing climate change -- averting catastrophic
damage to the planet in the coming decades requires co-ordinated
intervention on a global scale.

Prof McKechnie illustrates how dramatic an effect climate change can
within a short period. "In Australia, extreme heatwaves have caused
disastrous mortality events in which large numbers of individuals died
from lethal heat stroke or dehydration within a matter of hours. In
January 2009, thousands of wild budgerigars died at a site about 500 km
north of Perth; in November 2018, a severe heatwave in Cairns killed 23
000 spectacled flying foxes ­-- about a third of Australia's entire
population of this species -- in just two days. These kinds of events
underscore the potential for future extreme heat events to drive species
extinct within a matter of days."

The effects are also being felt in our neck of the woods. Current
research on southern yellow-billed hornbills in the Kalahari Desert,
which Prof McKechnie is involved in, suggests that higher summer
temperatures are severely affecting the breeding success of this
population. "Our models for hornbills and other Kalahari species concur
with the UN report and predict that by the end of this century, the
Kalahari will have lost much of its avian biodiversity as a direct
consequence of climate change."

Other direct drivers of extinction include changes in land and sea use,
direct exploitation of organisms, pollution, and invasive alien species.

Prof Chris Weldon, Associate Professor of Entomology in the Department
of Zoology and Entomology at UP, recognises the impacts of changes in
land use. "Many insects that perform important functions such as
pollination, seed dispersal and the breakdown of dead and waste matter
are on the decline because of their loss of habitat," he explains. "The
increase in human populations and urbanisation as well as the
intensification of agricultural practices and pesticides are destroying
these little creatures that help to secure a thriving environment."

In South African game reserves large mammals are becoming increasingly
isolated in small fragmented populations found in these protected areas.
"Not only are these fragments under increasing pressure from illegal
hunting, alien plant invasions, insufficient funding and climate change,
but they also need to be artificially managed to overcome the lack of
natural dispersal of the plants and animals from them," says
large-mammal expert Prof Michael Somers, who is also the Eugène Marais
Chair of Wildlife Management at UP's Mammal Research Institute in the
Faculty of Natural and Agricultural Sciences.

"As a result of land use change, native and/or sensitive species are
often not able to persist and are excluded, often by more competitive
species, in many cases non-native, invasive species," adds Dr Mark
Keith, also of the Mammal Research Institute. This is altering the
natural densities of species in communities; this eventually alters and
decays ecosystem functions in that area. "The concern is that we do not
fully understand community structures and what certain species do in a
system to allow for current system functioning, integrity and
resilience." Loss of function and/or resilience creates an unstable
system, which leads to the possibility for a system to change without
ever regaining its previous state and ecosystem function. Species
extinction is just one result of this change.

In his recent inauguration speech, President Cyril Ramaphosa said: "Let
us preserve our natural resources for future generations, as we work
with greater purpose to end the human destruction of our world." And
while he pledged to "build a South Africa we all want and deserve,"
individual action and world leadership is vital to conserve the planet
and prevent the looming existential threat that faces us.

While we wait on world leaders to make responsible decisions and
implement sustainable environmental policies, we can all make small
changes in our daily lives to bring about positive change, advises Prof
McKechnie. Switching households to solar power, using environmentally
friendly modes of transport and recycling are just a few practices that
can have a significant impact on the planet.

### 2AC -- Arctic BioD Key

#### Arctic biodiversity is an irreplaceable global good and is the basis for indigenous well-being in the region.

**Huntington, 13**---Senior Officer for the International Arctic at The

[Arctic biodiversity is an irreplaceable cultural,
scientific, ecological, economic and spiritual asset.]{.underline}

In addition to its intrinsic
worth, [Arctic biodiversity provides innumerable
services]{.underline} and values to people. Arctic habitats are home to
species with remarkable adaptations to survive in extreme cold and
highly variable climatic conditions. [Millions of
migratory]{.underline} [birds breed]{.underline} [in the
Arctic]{.underline} [and]{.underline} then [fly to every
continent]{.underline} [on Earth,]{.underline} [contributing
to]{.underline} **[global biodiversity and
ecological health]{.underline}**. More [than a tenth of the world's fish
catches by weight come from Arctic and sub-Arctic seas. Tourists are
travelling north in increasing numbers, and globally there is a growing
appreciation of Arctic species and ecosystems as increasingly rare
examples of largely pristine biodiversity. The Arctic is home to more
than 21,000 known species of highly cold-adapted mammals, birds, fish,
invertebrates, plants and fungi including lichens, as well as tens of
thousands of microbe species.]{.underline}

These include iconic species such as polar bear, muskox, bowhead whale,
narwhal, walrus, caribou, Arctic char, ivory gull, Arctic fox and snowy
owl as well as thousands of lesser known species. In addition to species
themselves, t[he Arctic also harbors a diversity of marine, freshwater
and terrestrial habitats, such as vast expanses of lowland tundra,
wetlands, mountains, extensive shallow ocean shelves, millennia-old ice
shelves, pack ice and huge seabird coastal cliffs.]{.underline}

[Among those who live in the Arctic are dozens of
distinct indigenous peoples who call the Arctic home.]{.underline} Their
ways of life demonstrate the vitality of language and traditional
knowledge, key aspects of the human relationship with
biodiversity. [Arctic cultures have been more reliant on hunting and
fishing than those in almost any other part of the world because of the
limited availability of edible wild
plants.]{.underline} [Some]{.underline} [species]{.underline}, such as
bears and whales, [have great spiritual importance in Arctic
cultures,]{.underline} [and harvest]{.underline} [of
wildlife]{.underline} [is]{.underline} [deeply rooted in the self
perception of Arctic peoples]{.underline}. Traditional foods currently
account for a smaller portion of indigenous diets than in the past,
but [biodiversity]{.underline} [and a healthy natural
environment]{.underline} [remain integral]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [wellbeing]{.underline} [of
Arctic inhabitants. **They provide not only food, but the everyday
context and basis for social identity, cultural survival and spiritual
life.**]{.underline}

What is biodiversity? The United Nations Convention on Biological
Diversity defines biodiversity as "the variability among living
organisms from all sources including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine
and other aquatic ecosystems, as well as the ecological complexes, of
which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between
species, and of ecosystems". [Biodiversity includes the multitude
of poorly known species, of which there are many in the Arctic, that
collectively provide the foundation for food webs and ecosystems. The
interactions between humans and their surroundings are also part of
the diversity, vitality and sustainability of life on
Earth.]{.underline}

Geographically, the Arctic is made up of the world's smallest ocean and
neighboring seas, surrounded by a relatively narrow fringe of island and
continental tundra, much of it underlain by permafrost. Freshwater
habitats range from shallow tundra ponds fed by small streams to large
deep lakes and rivers. Arctic land and freshwater areas are generally
low in productivity and species richness, though there are exceptions.
For example, the number of plant and lichen species in some tundra areas
is as high as in the richest grasslands of temperate and subtropical
regions. For the ocean, sea ice is the defining feature of the Arctic.
Unlike Arctic terrestrial and freshwater habitats, marine ecosystems on
some Arctic shelves are among the most productive on Earth. The [sea
ice]{.underline} itself [provides important habitat for many species and
is vital to the Arctic marine food web. Arctic]{.underline} marine,
freshwater and terrestrial **[ecosystems are interconnected physically
and biologically.]{.underline}**

Trump\'s latest comments come amid a string of conflicting messages from
his administration on the issue.

Trump announced a plan for a massive roundup and deportation of
immigrants ahead of his inauguration in January, a move that was
predicted to hit Iowa hard, damaging rural towns\' economies, leaving
livestock production hamstrung and slowing meat processing and other
manufacturing, said economists, worker and business advocates and labor
analysts.

Perpetually short of labor, Iowa is the leading U.S. producer of pork
and eggs and a top source of beef, turkey and milk. At large meatpacking
plants scattered across the state and in livestock operations,
immigrants are a major source of labor.

Under Trump, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been
conducting widespread raids and arresting and detaining immigrants, many
of whom do not have any criminal record.

Trump promised changes to protect migrants in the farming, hotel and
leisure industries in a June 12 Truth Social post.

Following those comments, Trump\'s administration directed immigration
officials to largely pause raids on farms, hotels, restaurants and
meatpacking plants. But the administration reversed course a few days
later and resumed the raids.

Then on June 20, Trump, while traveling to his golf club in Bedminster,
New Jersey, told reporters he wanted to shield farmers from the effects
of his crackdown on illegal immigration.

\"We\'re looking at doing something where, in the case of good,
reputable farmers, they can take responsibility for the people that they
hire and let them have responsibility, because we can\'t put the farms
out of business,\" Trump said. \"And at the same time we don\'t want to
hurt people that aren\'t criminals.\"

About 42% of farm workers in the United States between 2020 and 2022
lacked legal status, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland
Security.

In Iowa, arrests and deportations have both nearly tripled in the first
five months of 2025, compared with the same time period last year,
recent data shows. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has already
arrested and deported more people in Iowa in the first five months of
this year than it did throughout all of 2024.

Trump threw out his own statistics: American-born workers gained 830,000
new jobs, a record, while \"illegal aliens\" lost 340,000, he said.

And while he said the \"criminals\" should be kicked out, he
acknowledged many farmers have employed migrant workers for years.

\"We're working with Kristi and we're going to do something that we're
going to sort of put the farmers in charge,\" he said. \"And if
somebody, if a farmer's been with one of these people that works so
hard, they bend over all day. We don't have too many people who can do
that, but they work very hard and they know them very well. And some of

Background on Agricultural Trade Mix

Agricultural trade is essential to our nation's food security and
benefits American farmers and consumers alike. [[Farmers find export
markets eager to buy U.S. products that we grow in abundance such as
grains, oilseeds, meats and more.]{.underline}]{.mark} Consumers have
become used to eating fresh fruits and vegetables year-round, much of
which would be impossible without imports from our Southern trading
partners. Many cannot live without their daily cup of coffee, a tropical
import we do not grow in the continental United States. (Apologies to
Hawaii and Puerto Rico, which combined grow approximately 0.2% of the
coffee we consume).

Rising Imports and the Challenges to U.S. Specialty Crops

Bar chart of US Agricultural Trade Exports and Imports Fiscal Year 2024
Forecast

The category with the largest trade deficit is horticultural products --
predominantly made up of fresh fruits and vegetables. Accounting for 49%
of all imports by value, it has increased by \$22 billion (+31%) since
fiscal year 2020. In part, the increase in horticultural products
reflects a thriving U.S. economy. As real income per capita increases,
[[consumers are demanding more fresh fruits and
vegetables]{.underline}]{.mark}. This also reflects the strong U.S.
dollar, a focus on healthy diets, and a growing consumer preference for
fresh fruits and vegetables over frozen or canned products.

However, rising imports are both a cause and effect of the reduction in
U.S. fresh fruit and vegetable production, which has declined in volume
by 10% and 23.1%, respectively, since 2000. U.S. fresh fruit and
vegetable production is declining due to a multitude of factors,
including land loss due to urban encroachment, diseases such as citrus
greening, and, probably most importantly, a lack of affordable and
available farm labor. Production of many fresh fruits and vegetables is
extremely labor intensive. For U.S. agricultural production broadly,
labor accounts for about 10% of expenses. For fruit and vegetable
production -- labor costs account for 38.5% and 28.8% of input costs,
respectively.

Seasonal agricultural producers have access to the H-2A temporary worker
visa program, under which 378,000 jobs were certified in fiscal year
2023 -- three times the number certified only 10 years ago. With the
H-2A visa program, producers must pay an hourly rate called the "Adverse
Effect Wage Rate," established regionally based on local rates for field
and livestock workers. The AEWR has risen precipitously in recent years,
climbing an average of 5.9% annually since 2019. In 2024, the national
average AEWR is \$17.55 per hour. In New England and New York, it is
\$17.80. In California, the largest fresh fruit- and vegetable-producing
state, the AEWR is \$19.75. In addition to the required AEWR, employers
provide housing, food, transportation, visa fees, insurance and other
expenses for every H-2A worker. At the same time, agricultural workers
in Mexico are estimated to make almost the same amount in an entire day
than for one hour of work in California paid at the AEWR rate.

Decreasing U.S. Exports

Two major factors have contributed to the decline of the value of U.S.
exports since 2021: falling commodity prices and the strong U.S. Dollar.
As corn and soy prices fell, their export value naturally decreased. The
strong U.S. Dollar is making U.S. products less competitive due to
currency exchange alone. For instance, Japan is consistently a top-5
market for U.S. agricultural products. The Japanese Yen is the lowest it
has been against the U.S. Dollar since 1986 and half of its value from
only 12 years ago, in 2012. While this exchange rate is great for U.S.
tourists visiting Japan, it makes it expensive for Japanese consumers to
purchase U.S. products.

U.S. grain and oilseed exports are seeing headwinds from rising
competition from Brazil and other countries. Efforts by China to become
less dependent on agricultural imports from the U.S. are also having an
impact. In fact, fiscal year 2024 is forecasted to be the first year
that Mexico is the top destination for U.S. agricultural exports
overall.

It does not help that the U.S. has not entered any new free trade
agreements with new trading partners since 2012. At the same time -- the
rest of the world has continued to sign more FTAs. The Comprehensive and
Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), formed by
the other partners in the aftermath of the U.S. abandoning the
negotiated but unratified Trans-Pacific Partnership, is quickly slashing
tariffs for other exporters in major U.S. export markets on the Pacific
Rim and causing U.S. market shares to shrink for products ranging from
frozen fries to blueberries to pet food.

#### Wildfires are the direct cause of permafrost melt. Climate change leads to wildfire which in turn thaws permafrost.

North's climate change trifecta, ?/?/2020 (Couldn't find the exact

The Arctic Circle became unbelievably hot on June 20. In the Russian
community of Verkhoyansk, temperatures topped 38C, marking what may be
the highest air temperature ever recorded within the Arctic. The
temperatures at Verkhoyansk are part of a larger trend across western
Russia this summer, with small communities throughout the region
reporting temperatures that are smashing local records that have stood
for decades. During the latter half of June, surface temperatures
throughout western Siberia were as much as 10C above historical norms,
marking one of the hottest Junes on record despite relatively cool
temperatures at the start of the month. For scientists the world-over
these record-breaking temperatures are alarm bells, demonstrating the
kind of extreme weather events we can expect to see more often if
climate change continues unchecked. However, it is the long-term fallout
from modern heat waves that has many northern scientists deeply
concerned, as they will affect our planet for decades to come. The
**[[fires]{.mark} that [follow]{.mark} During [heat waves]{.mark}
surface temperatures soar, often [triggering a chain of fire-promoting
weather conditions]{.mark} including extreme
thunderstorms]{.underline}**. These thunderstorms have hundreds of
lightning strikes that can ignite the dry soils and vegetation that
serve as fuel for fire. **[[In]{.mark} northern regions like the [boreal
biome]{.mark}, these fire-promoting conditions can cause [large-scale
wildfires]{.mark} that [burn millions of hectares of forest]{.mark} in a
single summer]{.underline}**. Wildfire within the Arctic Circle in the
Sakha Republic, Russia, captured by Copernicus Sentinel, on May 19,
2020. (Pierre Markuse/flickr), CC BY Historically, humanity has
considered wildfire a true disaster and spent considerable resources to
suppress them. We now understand that despite the initial loss of
established trees and soils, wildfires are a natural and integral part
of the boreal biome. **[Modern wildfires]{.underline}**, however, are
**[occurring with increasing frequency and intensity, covering a larger
area]{.underline}** due weather events like severe heat waves. In
extreme fire years, these **[m[odern wildfires can burn deep into the
organic soils that characterize boreal forests]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
These carbon-rich soils have been built up over thousands of years and
hold approximately 30 per cent of the world's terrestrial carbon stocks.
When fires burn deep into soils or return too quickly to a forest, they
lose their "ancient carbon" stocks. Instead of being held in the ground
these ancient carbon reserves are combusted and released back into the
atmosphere, increasing the carbon levels. The **[higher carbon dioxide
levels generated by [wildfires intensify climate change]{.mark} impacts
like heat waves, which can lead to further wildfires, [forming a
powerful "positive feedback]{.mark}" [loop]{.mark} with climate
change]{.underline}**. While these trends alone are alarming, northern
researchers warn that the fallout from heat waves won't stop when the
fires burn out. **[In northern regions where the soils historically stay
frozen year-round]{.underline}**, a whole new set of changes are
beginning to take form. When permafrost perishes Permafrost forms on the
landscape when soil materials remain below freezing for two or more
consecutive years. In some areas permafrost forms in direct response to
a cold climate. As one moves further south, however,
**[[permafrost]{.mark} becomes [increasingly dependent on the presence
of thick organic soil]{.mark}s, surface vegetation and a shady
overstorey to survive the warm summer months]{.underline}**. In those
cases, the ecosystem acts like a giant protective blanket, limiting the
sun's heat that is able to reach the frozen permafrost materials below.
Carbon-rich peat burns readily, making it good fuel for lightning-caused
fires. (U.S. National Parks Service, Western Arctic National Parklands)
When **[permafrost ecosystems burn, the [wildfire consumes these
protective layers, often triggering permafrost
thaw]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This can occur gradually, with the thawed
layer expanding slowly over decades, or abruptly, with the thawed layer
expanding dramatically over years. The land may cave in or sink, plant
communities may change completely and local water flows may be rerouted.
In both cases, the loss of permafrost makes the massive Arctic carbon
reserves more vulnerable to loss. With gradual thaw microbes are able to
break down and release the previously frozen carbon back to the
atmosphere as carbon dioxide. In contrast, abrupt thaw commonly occurs
in ice-rich permafrost resulting in warmer but also wetter soils. Under
these conditions decomposition still occurs but carbon is commonly
returned to the atmosphere as methane, a greenhouse gas approximately 30
times more powerful at trapping heat than carbon dioxide. All this lost
carbon may make the positive feedback with climate change even stronger.
While scientists are working to understand if the vegetation that grows
after permafrost thaw is able to offset all the carbon released during
decomposition, most current models indicate that permafrost thaw will
ultimately be a source of atmospheric carbon. Researchers are coming to
understand just how tightly linked these disturbances caused by climate
change really are. What appears as an individual event --- **[heat wave,
[forest fire or permafrost thaw]{.mark} --- has [cascading ramifications
through time and space]{.mark} in the Arctic,]{.underline}** potentially
serving as the seed crystal for the next disturbance in the coming
months, years or even decades that follow. Heat waves, wildfires and
permafrost thaw represent an environmental trifecta that are inherently
linked and drive change in the occurrence and intensity of one another.

### AT: Canada Thumps

#### Thumper fails. Travelling smoke only affects human health. No warrants on why it further exacerbates wildfires key to the aff plan. And, smoke impact is a reason why aff plan is key to stopping effects of wildfire smoke specific to Alaska.

**Dieleman, 20** (Research associate, Department of Integrative Biology,

https://www.arcticfocus.org/stories/heat-waves-wildfire-permafrost-thaw-the-norths-climate-change-trifecta//
BK)

Although particle pollution is a principal public health threat from
short-and longer-term exposure to wildfire smoke, **[it is important to
keep in mind that [wildfire smoke]{.mark} is [a complex mixture]{.mark}
that consists of other pollutants that have also been shown to lead to a
variety [of health effects]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The health effects of
particle pollution exposure can range from relatively minor (e.g., eye
and respiratory tract irritation) to more serious health effects (e.g.,
exacerbation of asthma and heart failure, and premature death). Fine
particles are respiratory irritants, and exposures to high
concentrations can cause persistent coughing, phlegm, wheezing, and
difficulty breathing. Even in healthy people, exposures to fine
particles can potentially lead to transient reductions in lung function,
and pulmonary inflammation. **[Particle pollution may also [affect the
body's ability to remove inhaled foreign materials]{.mark}, [such as
viruses and bacteria, from the lungs]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Short-term
exposures (i.e., days to weeks) to fine particles are associated with
increased risk of exacerbation of pre-existing respiratory and
cardiovascular disease, as well as premature mortality (U.S. EPA, 2009).
The examination of persistent short-term exposures to wildfire smoke
(i.e., exposures over a series of days up to a few weeks) has been
limited to a few epidemiologic studies examining the cumulative effect
of wildfire smoke exposure on the health of wildland firefighters
(Adetona et al. 2016). Initial evidence indicates that continuous (i.e.,
over multiple days) **[occupational wildland fire smoke exposure may
have a cumulative effect on lung function]{.underline}**, with some
studies reporting a progressive decline during burn seasons (e.g.,
Adetona et al. 2016). However, it is unclear if this decline persists
across off-seasons and it is difficult to compare a wildland
firefighter's occupational exposure and resulting health effects to
those experienced by the general population. But certainly, more caution
is warranted during extended exposures.

### 2AC -- Methane Add-ons

#### Methane release exacerbates current wildfire and glacier melt.

Emitting Methane?, Hamza Badamasi is a freelance environmental
journalist and researcher with a bachelors and masters in environmental

Methane is a natural gas that contains a carbon atom bonded to four
hydrogen atoms. **[[Even though methane constitutes only 0.00018 percent
of the atmosphere, it is responsible for about one-sixth of]{.mark} the
last few decades' [global warming]{.mark}. Estimates for arctic methane

year [in 2006]{.mark}, [then up to 17 million tons in
2013]{.mark}]{.underline}**. We don't have solid measurements yet, but
we know the phenomenon is gaining momentum as we speak. A study
conducted by Knoblauch et al. **[[2018 reveals]{.mark} that [permafrost

1000 million tons of methane by 2100.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

What Happens When Permafrost Thaws?

As temperature rises, frozen organic matter is made available for
decomposition into CO2 if oxygen is available or CH4 if not. **[Since
these warm the atmosphere in turn, a positive feedback, but also [a
vicious cycle is triggered]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Impact of Global Temperature on Permafrost

**[[Polar and high altitude areas are more sensitive to climate
change]{.mark} than the rest of the world.]{.underline}** They have
**[been [warming at three times the global average rate]{.mark}, as
[demonstrated by exceptionally intense wildfire seasons and rapid
glacier melt]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Permafrost loss is less obvious but
just as worrisome. A detailed study revealed that, on average,
permafrost around the Arctic, Antarctic, and the high mountain warmed by
0.3 °C between 2007 and 2016.

Accessed 7-22-25\]

Around the world, the number and intensity of wildfires is on the rise,
and the [Arctic]{.underline} and sub-Arctic regions have been among the
hardest hit. As SUSANA HANCOCK writes, these fires send some of the
world's most dense carbon stores up in smoke, with ramifications for
human health, the world's climate and the Arctic itself.

These more energetic [fires have doubled in strength and size over the
past two decades]{.underline}, [consuming]{.underline} more [fuel and
releasing]{.underline} more [heat]{.underline}. As a result, [they are
associated with]{.underline} both [greater emissions]{.underline} [and
more social, ecological and economic losses]{.underline}, whether direct
or indirect. [In the Arctic]{.underline} and sub-Arctic boreal and
temperate forests, [the intensity of wildfires **increased 7.3-fold and
11.1-fold**]{.underline}, respectively, [from 2002]{.underline} to
20[23]{.underline} (as measured by the heat energy they release).

[In Russia]{.underline} this year, [notable fires were burning by early
June]{.underline}. By mid-month, [a state of emergency had been
declared]{.underline} in Sakha and Tuva provinces. Elsewhere in Siberia,
[cumulative emissions from]{.underline} abnormally [strong
fires]{.underline} in places like Amur Oblast had already [surpassed
any]{.underline} June or July [record in]{.underline} the **[22
years]{.underline}** of monitoring by the Copernicus Atmosphere
Monitoring Service. These [emissions triggered air quality warnings
across Mongolia, China and Japan]{.underline}. The year
[2024]{.underline} is continuing a trend that [has seen]{.underline} six
of [the most powerful wildfire years occur]{.underline} within the past
seven.

Russia's emergency situations minister, Alexander Kurenkov, has stated
that even though Siberia has experienced 30 per cent fewer fires this
year than in 2023 (so far), [the area burned is 50 per cent
larger.]{.underline}

A region under pressure

The pace of [cl]{.underline}imate [c]{.underline}hange in the Arctic [is
eclipsing]{.underline} that of [other areas in]{.underline} terms of
[warming and]{.underline} new patterns of [heat]{.underline} and
moisture. [Higher temperatures]{.underline} and more arid conditions
[are making the region]{.underline} increasingly [susceptible
to]{.underline} large-scale [wildfires]{.underline} with more
significant emissions. Boreal forests are some of the most carbon-rich
landscapes on Earth, with as much as 80 to 90 per cent of their carbon
stored below ground. Much of the boreal [carbon has been protected
from]{.underline} past [burns, but]{.underline} these [hotter fires burn
more deeply into the soil, releasing carbon]{.underline} that has been
stored for millennia.

Recent studies highlight [several climate trend]{.underline}s that are
[driv]{.underline}ing these [more powerful burns and indicate the reach
of their influence]{.underline}. For example, some show connections
between heat waves in continental Europe and large-scale fires
throughout the circumpolar region. One study found that drier conditions
as a result of human-induced climate change fuelled more than 50 per
cent of the rise in fire activity in the United States.

[Since his re-election in November, Trump]{.underline} has said multiple
times that he wants to see Canada join the U.S. as its 51st state ---
though his [rhetoric has **cooled** in recent weeks.]{.underline}

Trump was asked about the idea of Canada joining the U.S. as he was
leaving the G7 meeting in Alberta last month and said he still thinks
the country should become a state.

\"I think it\'s a much better deal from Canada, but, you know, it\'s up
to them,\" the president told reporters.

[Trump and Carney have been in talks to reach a **trade
agreement**]{.underline} after the U.S. slapped a series of tariffs on
Canada earlier this year. [Carney had set a deadline]{.underline} for an
agreement to be reached a few times but has most recently pushed it back
[to Aug. 1.]{.underline}

Murkowski was joined in Ottawa by Democratic senators Ron Wyden of
Oregon, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire and Catherine Cortez Masto from
Nevada.

[Carney briefly spoke to reporters, saying he had a \"**good meeting**\"
with the U.S. delegation.]{.underline}

[The senators showed off **Canada-U.S. friendship bracelets** they wore
into the meeting.]{.underline}

[\"Four senators here, \[from\] both political parties, spent the
morning working to **build bridges**, not throw wrenches,\"]{.underline}
Wyden said of the trade talks.

Wyden said he and his colleagues covered a number of topics with Carney,
including Canada\'s digital services tax and softwood lumber.

[The federal government rescinded the tax on companies including Amazon,
Google, Meta, Uber and Airbnb last month after Trump called for its
removal.]{.underline}

[Wyden said Monday that he wants Canada to permanently kill the tax in
legislation and suggested Carney was open to that idea.]{.underline}

The Oregon senator also said he and his colleagues were pushing for a
quota on Canadian softwood lumber exports to the U.S.

\"Softwood lumber is enormously important and we asked about how we
could make progress on dealing with that issue,\" Wyden said.

[Carney says softwood quota is a possibility]{.underline}

[The prime minister suggested last week he is open to a trade agreement
that includes quotas.]{.underline}

\"There is normally some element of managed trade that comes out of any
agreement that comes there, it can include quotas, can include a variety
of trade factors,\" Carney said.

The prime minister\'s comments came after B.C. Premier David Eby told
Bloomberg News that a softwood quota was on the table in the trade talks
with the U.S.

Softwood lumber has been a sticking point in Canada-U.S. relations for
decades. The two countries have been without a softwood deal since 2015.

Speaking at premiers meeting in Huntsville, Ont., on Monday, Eby said
he\'s been pushing Carney to reach a softwood deal with the Americans as
part of the broader trade talks.

[\"I\'ve been advocating for that with the prime minister: start with
softwood, let\'s get a deal done,\" Eby told reporters.]{.underline}

A New Chapter in Canada--U.S. Relations

Diplomatic discussions reached a critical juncture last week as Prime
Minister Mark Carney welcomed a bipartisan group of U.S. senators to
Ottawa.

[The meeting focused on the evolving **Canada--U.S.** trade
**partnership**, border security, and the urgent need to address the
fentanyl crisis---**a deadly epidemic affecting both
nations.**]{.underline}

Why This Meeting Mattered

On Canadian soil, senators Ron Wyden (Oregon), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska),
Maggie Hassan (New Hampshire), and Catherine Cortez Masto (Nevada) sat
down with Prime Minister Carney to reinforce economic ties and
strengthen continental security.

[This high-level meeting comes at a pivotal moment, as **both
countries** navigate shifting global trade patterns and intensifying
cross-border drug trafficking threats.]{.underline}

[While previous leaders have tackled similar issues, Carney's approach
is notably comprehensive. It integrates trade modernization, health
responses, and defense strategies under one policy
umbrella---highlighting a modern vision of **bilateral
cooperation.**]{.underline}

Main Topics on the Table

1\. Strengthening Economic Ties

[Trade between Canada and the U.S. supports millions of jobs, with
Canadian businesses playing a vital role in several U.S. states. During
the talks, both sides **reaffirmed** their **commitment to stable
trade** flows]{.underline}, especially in key sectors like:

- Manufacturing

- Energy

- Forestry

- Agriculture

Recent economic figures underscore this relationship:

2024 Trade Overview Value (USD)

Total Canada--U.S. trade \$762.1 billion

U.S. exports to Canada \$349.4 billion

U.S. imports from Canada \$412.7 billion

Trade deficit (U.S.) \$63.3 billion

[These figures highlight a balanced and deeply integrated trading
relationship.]{.underline} Notably, 76% of Canada's exports head south
of the border, and Canadian goods remain essential to the day-to-day
lives of Americans---especially in the states represented at the
meeting.

2\. Tackling the Fentanyl Crisis Together

With opioid overdoses claiming 21 lives daily in Canada, and fentanyl
contributing to nearly 80% of these deaths, the crisis is national in
scale. Yet, it's also deeply personal for affected families in
communities from Vancouver to Halifax.

The Prime Minister and senators discussed:

- Increasing surveillance at the Canada--U.S. border.

- Enhancing cross-border law enforcement cooperation.

- Expanding support services for affected communities.

Since 2018, Canada has dismantled 44 illicit fentanyl labs and committed
over \$1.3 billion CAD to new border technology---including drones and
detection systems.

While seizures of fentanyl at the northern border remain low (just 26kg
in 2025), this meeting underscores the need for vigilance, especially as
trafficking routes adapt.

Security, Defence, and Border Policy

[Beyond drugs and trade, the group addressed broader security issues.
With rising geopolitical tensions and evolving threats---from cybercrime
to organized trafficking---Carney emphasized a coordinated approach to
continental defense.]{.underline}

This includes:

- Shared intelligence through a new Canada--U.S. Strike Force.

- Modernizing border crossings to reduce illegal migration.

- Emergency preparedness investments in border communities.

As a result of recent policies, illegal border crossings from Canada
into the U.S. have dropped by 90% since their 2024 peak. Moreover,
irregular asylum claims in Canada have decreased by 77%, reflecting
successful policy shifts and improved bilateral enforcement.

Local Stakes and Everyday Impact

[These talks weren't just diplomatic formalities---they directly touch
lives in both countries.]{.underline}

For Canadians, the outcomes could affect:

- Job security in export-heavy industries like steel and agriculture.

- Border travel for business, tourism, and family visits.

- Public health resources, especially in areas hit hard by opioids.

And for Americans in Oregon, Alaska, New Hampshire, and Nevada, Canadian
economic activity means:

- Reliable supply chains in energy and raw materials.

- Cross-border jobs, especially in rural manufacturing.

- Shared community investments through binational projects.

What This Means for Canadians

Professionals working in law enforcement, logistics, healthcare, and
small business should pay close attention. New trade rules, security
cooperation, and drug enforcement protocols may soon:

- Influence operational costs and import/export processes

- Affect regulatory compliance for cross-border industries

- Reshape health and safety strategies in communities

For example, small Canadian exporters may benefit from clearer trade
protocols, while border town hospitals may receive new support to handle
opioid-related health emergencies.

The Takeaway

[As negotiations continue in Washington, D.C., and Ottawa, the path
forward will require diplomacy, flexibility, and
pragmatism.]{.underline} Minister Dominic LeBlanc is expected to build
on this momentum in his upcoming talks with U.S. officials.

In the words of one federal advisor, ["This is more than just
trade---it's about **redefining our partnership** in a world that's
changing fast."]{.underline}

For Canadians, whether raising families, running businesses, or building
careers, this evolving relationship with our southern neighbour is more
than policy---it's personal.

from the U.S. Forest Service and about 1,000 from the National Park
Service were fired under]{.underline} President Donald
[Trump]{.underline} and Elon Musk's attempts to shrink the federal
government.

President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's [efforts to shrink the federal
government]{.underline}, launched as the deadly Palisades and Eaton
fires burned across Los Angeles, have [left the country's wildland
firefighting force unprepared for the]{.underline} rapidly approaching
[wildfire season.]{.underline}

[The administration has frozen funds,]{.underline} including money
appropriated by Congress, and issued a deluge of orders [eliminating
federal employees,]{.underline} which has thrown agencies tasked with
battling blazes into disarray as individual offices and managers
struggle to interpret the directives. The uncertainty has [limited
training and postponed work to reduce flammable vegetation in areas
vulnerable to wildfire. It has also left some firefighters with little
choice but to leave the force]{.underline}, their colleagues said.

ProPublica spoke to a dozen firefighters and others who assist with the
federal wildfire response across the country and across agencies. They
described a range of immediate impacts on a workforce that was already
stressed by budgetary woes predating the Trump administration. [Hiring
of some seasonal workers has stalled. Money for]{.underline} partner
[nonprofits]{.underline} that assist with fuel-reduction projects [has
been frozen.]{.underline} And [crews that had traveled to support
prescribed burns in Florida were turned back]{.underline}, while those
assisting with wildfire cleanup in California faced confusion over how
long they would be allowed to do that work.

"[Uncertainty is at an all-time high. Morale is at an all-time
low]{.underline}," one federal wildland firefighter said. Multiple
federal employees asked not to be named because of their fear of
retribution from the White House.

In two separate lawsuits, judges issued temporary restraining orders
against aspects of the White House's broad freeze of federal spending,
although the administration continues arguing that it has the authority
to halt the flow of money. Some funding freezes appear to be thawing,
but projects and hiring have already been severely impacted.

In one case, the freeze to Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation
Reduction Act funding, combined with orders limiting travel by some
federal employees, forced the National Park Service to cancel a massive
prescribed burn scheduled for January and February in Everglades
National Park and Big Cypress National Preserve, ProPublica has
confirmed. Prescribed burns help prevent catastrophic wildfires by
clearing vegetation that serves as fuel, and the meticulously planned
151,434-acre Florida fire --- to cover more than six times the land area
of nearby Miami --- was also meant to protect a Native American
reservation and improve ecological biodiversity.

"We will be more vulnerable to a catastrophic fire in the future as a
result of not being able to do the prescribed burns," a federal
firefighter with direct knowledge of the situation said.

The National Park Service gave conflicting explanations for the
cancellation, suggesting in a news release that weather was the cause
while internally acknowledging it was due to funding, the firefighter
said.

This comes as the U.S. Forest Service, which employs more than 10,000
firefighters, has been wracked by long-running deficits and a lack of
support for the physical and mental health stresses inherent in the job.
[Federal firefighters]{.underline} told ProPublica they were [happy to
do a dangerous job, but the administration's actions have added to
uncertainty surrounding their often-seasonal employment.]{.underline}

A spokesperson for the Forest Service said in a statement that a major
prescribed burn training program was proceeding as planned and "active
management, including hazardous fuels reduction and prescribed fires,
continue under other funding authorities." The newly confirmed secretary
of the U.S. Department of Agriculture will review the remainder of the
agency's spending, according to the statement. The Forest Service did
not say specifically what funding the agency has available or when the
freezes might be lifted.

"Protecting the people and communities we serve, as well as the
infrastructure, businesses, and resources they depend on to grow and
thrive, remains a top priority," the statement said.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

The reality is [supervisors are guessing how to interpret the White
House's commands, and a "huge leadership vacuum" has resulted in
conflicting orders,]{.underline} according to Ben McLane, captain of a
federal handcrew, which constructs fireline around an active blaze.

A national firefighting leadership training program that McLane was set
to attend was canceled on short notice, he said. McLane acknowledged
that federal firefighting agencies need a major overhaul, noting that
his crew was downsized 30% by pre-Trump administration cuts. But the
current confusion could further impact public safety because of the lack
of clear leadership and the disrupted preparations for wildfire season.

"Wildfire doesn't care about our bureaucratic calendar," McLane said.

#### Trump's budget cuts significantly reduced wildfire readiness

President Donald [Trump]{.underline}'s moves to slash the federal
workforce have [gutted the ranks of wildland firefighters and support
personnel,]{.underline} fire professionals warn, [leaving communities to
face deadly consequences]{.underline} when big blazes arrive this
summer.

["There's going to be firefighters that die because of this, there will
be communities that burn,"]{.underline} said Steve Gutierrez, a union
official who served 15 years as a firefighter with the U.S. Forest
Service.

Gutierrez now serves as a labor relations representative with the
National Federation of Federal Employees, which represents government
workers. He said [thousands of wildland firefighters have had their jobs
thrown into limbo]{.underline} by Trump's government-wide hiring freeze.

Brian Fennessy, chief of the Orange County Fire Authority and president
of the California Fire Chiefs Association, echoed that concern. "The
public needs to know they're at risk," Fennessy said. "If the public
knew all of this, they would lose their minds."

[Federal agencies depend on]{.underline} an army of [seasonal
firefighters to fill their ranks during the months when wildfires are
most active]{.underline}. Scott, a Forest Service firefighter with six
years of experience in the Western United States, who asked to be
identified by a pseudonym to avoid retaliation, is among those whose
role has been thrown into uncertainty.

"It's just going to be a disaster for the wildfire response this
season," he said.

Scott was slated to move to a new Forest Service fire station this
spring. But following the federal hiring freeze, he was told by his
captain that it's unclear whether his new job still exists. Thousands of
his colleagues are in a similar state of limbo.

In a statement to Stateline, the Forest Service said wildland
firefighting jobs are considered public safety positions that are
exempted from the hiring freeze, and the agency is working with the
federal Office of Personnel Management on those positions. The agency
did not respond to follow-up questions about the number of unfilled
positions under review.

The U.S. Department of the Interior and Bureau of Indian Affairs did not
grant Stateline interview requests.

Federal agencies employed more than 17,000 wildland fire staffers last
year, many of them in seasonal roles. This year, [many of those workers
had job offers rescinded --- or had their transfers and promotions put
on hold]{.underline} --- just as they were set to begin onboarding and
training for the 2025 fire season.

Trump's efforts to cut the federal workforce are led by his newly
created commission dubbed the Department of Government Efficiency,
helmed by billionaire Elon Musk, the world's richest man.

Aside from the hiring freeze, the [Forest Service fired an additional
3,400 staffers]{.underline} last week, many of whom [provided critical
support for wildfire operations.]{.underline} Meanwhile, [Trump's freeze
on federal spending has cut off funding for]{.underline} projects such
as [prescribed burns to reduce future risk.]{.underline} Wildfire
officials offer mixed reports on whether that funding has been restored
in the wake of judicial rulings.

"[We are watching a valuable \[federal\] partner in wildland fire
suppression go into this fire season]{.underline} unnecessarily
[handicapped]{.underline}," said Thomas Kyle-Milward, wildfire
communications manager with the Washington State Department of Natural
Resources. "That's concerning."

States, tribes and fire chiefs are all watching the situation closely.
Officials say they're preparing for a fire season in which they may have
minimal federal support. While they plead with Trump to reverse course
quickly, they fear much of the damage may be irreversible. Many wildland
fire officials noted that seasonal workers will likely move on to other
jobs if their position with a federal agency is in doubt.

"If there's not enough federal firefighters, that affects everybody in
the state," said Jake Rhoades, fire chief of Buckeye Fire-Medical-Rescue
Department in the Phoenix suburbs and president of the Arizona Fire
Chiefs Association. "That's scary for me."

Rhoades and others noted that firefighters need significant training and
qualifications to fill leadership positions. Trump's actions have
delayed that onboarding process. As a result, engine crews could be
grounded this summer because they don't have a certified leader, or
teams could be sent into harm's way without the proper training.

The federal role

Wildland fire response in the U.S. is a collaborative effort shared by a
variety of entities, from tiny local fire districts to massive federal
agencies. In Western states especially, the feds play a crucial role.
Agencies manage a vast landscape of national forests, national parks and
Bureau of Land Management parcels. The Bureau of Indian Affairs also
provides wildfire response on tribal reservations.

While state agencies have invested heavily in their own wildfire crews,
they say the [federal agencies are critical partners.]{.underline}

"If they're unable to fill the majority of their positions, it would
have an impact on everybody this summer," said Vaughn Jones, wildland
fire management section chief with the Division of Fire Prevention &
Control in the Colorado Department of Public Safety. "We have to partner
with them every day of every fire season."

Trump's orders have thrown those agencies into chaos.

"I hear it multiple times a day from folks who are applying for jobs,
from folks who are trying to fill positions, and they're all getting
stymied," said Bobbie Scopa, executive secretary with Grassroots
Wildland Firefighters, a nonprofit that advocates for federal staffers.
"These folks are worried about their families and paying the mortgage,
and they're worried about their physical safety if they're going to be
responding to fires with a crew that's not staffed up all the way."

Federal firefighters corroborated that account.

"They're saying there's this [public safety exemption]{.underline}, and
that's a [blatant lie]{.underline}, because I'm a wildland firefighter
and my job has been frozen," said Scott, the Forest Service employee.

Scott said many of his colleagues were among the 3,400 Forest Service
employees fired last week. While the agency said those cuts do not
include firefighters, wildland fire experts note that many staffers in
other roles hold wildfire certifications and serve on the line during
fire season. And nearly all of them play critical support roles for the
agency's wildfire response.

Another Forest Service firefighter, who asked to remain anonymous, said
the cuts to his unit included an aviation manager who supervised
helicopter contracts and crews, as well as mapping specialists who
provided key information to wildfire crews.

"There's going to be [days where we can't call a helicopter because of
staffing]{.underline}," he said. "From a mapping perspective, our
intelligence-gathering is going to be really affected by losing those
people."

Scott said he's begun applying for other jobs, but is still holding out
hope he can stay with the Forest Service. But he said many other
firefighters will have moved on by the time the feds get their act
together.

A wildfire planner in a Western state, who asked to remain anonymous to
avoid retaliation, said the impacts of Trump's cuts will be felt long
beyond this fire season.

"This could end up costing us a generation of firefighters," he said.
"They think a two-month delay doesn't mean anything, but people get laid
off and they find other work. This is a very specific skillset, and
there ain't many people in this work."

Officials at all levels say that recruitment and retention of
firefighters is already a major challenge. Wildland fire workers must
accept unsteady seasonal positions, with grueling hours and exposure to
dangerous conditions and cancer-causing smoke. Many suffer from mental
health issues as a result. And the profession's paltry salaries, experts
say, rarely match the demands.

Contingency plans

State and local leaders say they're still working to make sense of the
federal chaos. In Nevada, where 86% of the land is managed by federal
agencies, the turmoil could have an outsized impact.

"Obviously, we're a little nervous right now," said Kacey KC, the Nevada
state forester and fire warden. "We're putting contingency plans in
place for emergency hires for fire season, if need be."

KC said [a loss in federal support would be a huge blow to Nevada's
wildfire response efforts]{.underline}. As the state works to staff up
its own crews, it has seen an increase in applicants from federal
agencies, perhaps indicating that the uncertainty is driving Forest
Service and BLM employees to other jobs.

In Arizona, officials say they plan to lean on an interstate compact
that allows them to share resources with Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New
Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming and the Canadian province of
Saskatchewan. Jones, the Colorado official, said such agreements could
be essential this year.

"If \[federal support\] is diminished, those compacts and the states
finding ways to make things happen will be critical," he said.

Nevada is one of the few states that has not signed onto a wildfire
compact. KC said she's pushing lawmakers to authorize the state to join
such agreements.

In Washington state, the Department of Natural Resources is planning to
meet with regional Forest Service leaders to assess what adjustments
they may have to make.

"Are the feds able to field an adequate number of firefighters that they
can cover their jurisdiction within Washington state?" said
Kyle-Milward, the DNR official. "We're concerned that they won't."

In recent years, the state has invested heavily in its own response,
staffing up to 700 firefighters, in an effort to become less dependent
on federal agencies.

Tribal nations are also trying to make sense of the situation. The
federal Bureau of Indian Affairs employs thousands of firefighters that
respond to fires on tribal lands. And many tribes staff their own
wildfire crews using federal funding that's now in doubt.

For the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, in northeast
Washington state, it's unclear whether they'll be able to hire the
seasonal firefighters they rely on during wildfire season.

"It's definitely a touch-and-go situation right now," said Chairman
Jarred-Michael Erickson. "We're hoping to get answers sooner than later.
I really hope they're looking at this, because wildfire season comes
really quick and if you're not prepared..."

In 2023, wildfires burned more than 57,000 acres on the Colville
Reservation.

Prevention work

[Trump's freeze on federal spending is another major concern for
wildfire professionals. In Washington state, for instance, officials
have lost access to more than \$200 million in wildfire preparedness
funds]{.underline}, the Seattle Times reported. That money was [intended
to help agencies purchase equipment, train local departments, plan
evacuation routes and conduct fuels reduction projects like prescribed
burns to reduce risk.]{.underline}

Wildfire experts say the Inflation Reduction Act and infrastructure law
passed under President Joe Biden made significant investments in
projects to improve forest health and prevent out-of-control megafires.
Trump has attempted to block those grants.

"If we're not able to do that in certain areas, then the fuel load is
going to be impacted, and that increases the possibility of the
magnitude of some of these fires," said Rhoades, the president of the
Arizona Fire Chiefs Association.

The Western wildfire planner, who asked to remain anonymous, said the
funding freeze is threatening projects to improve the safety of local
communities.

"\[[Trump\] is driving the wildfire prevention train off the
rails,]{.underline}" he said. "I'm hoping that this year is not the year
that the big fire shows up in my neighborhood."

### AT: Canada / Black Carbon

#### Cooperation with Canada solves a [majority]{.underline} of the alt cause. Black carbon in non-Arctic countries are unlikely to affect Arctic Ice\-\--their Clarity card only states it'll be bad if it [settles]{.underline} on the ice.

**1NC Clarity 25** \[Clarity, company focused on providing air quality
monitoring solutions; "Black carbon's effect on Arctic ice melt,"
Clarity 3/3/25;
https://www.clarity.io/blog/black-carbons-effect-on-arctic-ice-melt\]

Black carbon\'s effect on Arctic ice

[Black carbon significantly influences Arctic climate dynamics. [When
black carbon settles on snow and ice, it **reduces** their
albedo]{.mark}---essentially their ability to reflect sunlight. This
reduction in albedo means less sunlight is reflected, and **more solar
radiation** is **absorbed**. Consequently, these ice masses melt at an
**accelerated rate.**]{.underline}

This process has profound implications. As ice melts, the Arctic\'s
ability to regulate global climate patterns diminishes. The exposed
ocean absorbs more heat, further warming the region. This warming not
only affects local ecosystems but also has cascading effects on global
weather patterns

[Reduced ice cover in the Arctic does open potential new shipping
routes]{.underline}. These routes could reshape global trade, offering
shorter paths between major markets. However, the environmental cost of
such developments must be considered. The increase in shipping traffic
could exacerbate air pollution, compounding the effects of climate
change

Efforts to mitigate these impacts require precise measurement of black
carbon emissions.

Sources and global impact

Black carbon emissions stem from diverse sources, each contributing
significantly to its global impact.

[Major sources]{.underline}: Diesel engines, [biomass
burning]{.underline}, and residential heating are primary contributors.
[These activities release potent pollutants into the atmosphere.
Developing countries account for over 75% of these emissions, primarily
due to]{.underline} widespread use of cookstoves and [solid fuels
like]{.underline} coal and [wood.]{.underline}

### Canada

#### Despite Trump, US and Canada are [still]{.underline} cooperating, even if it's difficult.

[In the wake of President Trump's antagonistic behavior at the Group of
7 Summit this past weekend and his Twitter tirade against Canadian Prime
Minister Trudeau]{.underline}, you might not have noticed that just a
week ago, [the U.S. and Canada formally **reaffirmed** a commitment to
work together to **eliminate unnecessary differences** between the two
countries' regulatory frameworks.]{.underline}

[The Canada-United States Regulatory Cooperation Council (**RCC**) aims
to **reduce regulatory barriers** to trade while maintaining the
benefits of health, safety, and environmental policies; it remains a
valuable, high-level forum for dialogue and a recognition of the
importance of trade with one of our closest trading
partners.]{.underline}

{mosads}[The RCC is co-chaired by the administrator of the Office of
Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) in the U.S. and the secretary
of the Treasury Board in Canada. It meets at least once a year and
brings together senior officials from regulatory departments and
agencies to identify challenges to regulatory cooperation at the federal
level and present opportunities for overcoming them.]{.underline}

The new agreement also commits to holding stakeholder forums to solicit
ideas from a broader audience for improving regulatory outcomes.

This is important, because unnecessary regulatory differences between
countries can result in persistent barriers to trade that are less
obvious than traditional barriers, like tariffs. While recognizing that
countries may take different regulatory actions according to their
national laws and sovereign policies, the agreement encourages the two
countries to consider others' policies when developing or modifying
regulations, with a goal of fostering alignment when appropriate and
feasible.

[The RCC commits to prioritizing job creation, economic growth and
innovation while maintaining high levels of public protections and
continued development of good regulatory practices for **effective
cooperation**. Regulatory cooperation can improve health and safety
outcomes for the public --- increasing benefits while reducing costs.
For example, U.S. and Canadian transportation regulators worked together
to develop uniform disability parking permit standards, thereby allowing
citizens to travel more freely across borders.]{.underline}

[There are real benefits to reducing barriers to trade, and regulatory
cooperation is an important policy component.]{.underline} Ironically,
this policy tool is usually turned to after the "low hanging fruit" has
been plucked --- in other words, after traditional barriers to trade,
like tariffs, have been removed.

[By cooperating on regulatory practices after they have addressed the
more obvious hurdles to trade, governments have allowed markets to
better drive economic gains in the form of lower production costs, lower
prices for imported products, and increased investment flows between
countries. Studies suggest that improved regulatory coherence between
the U.S. and European Union, for example, could result in a 0.3 percent
gain in U.S. GDP --- no small figure considering that absence of
cooperation left about \$14 billion dollars on the table in
2017.]{.underline}

Trump's decision earlier this month to impose new tariffs on steel and
aluminum from our trading partners not only caused strife at the G-7
Summit, but threatens to harm the U.S. economy. Economists estimate the
tariffs will cost 16 jobs for every one steel or aluminum manufacturing
job gained. Over two-thirds of these losses are likely to affect
low-skilled workers. The combination of tariffs, quotas, and retaliation
by U.S. trade partners could reduce U.S. GDP by 0.2 percent annually.
This amounts to roughly 400,000 jobs lost on net.

The Department of Commerce threatens to add to these burdens with a new
investigation under Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act into
restricting automobile imports to the U.S. because they "threaten to
impair the national security."

Given these developments and the president's Twitter outbursts after the
G-7 Summit, the RCC agreement to cooperate on regulation may amount to
one step forward, 10 steps backward. Nevertheless, [highlighting the
value of engaging in regulatory cooperation with trade partners can
illustrate why U.S. citizens benefit from fewer barriers to
trade]{.underline}.

[Canada and the United States are **deeply integrated
economically**---they share one of the world's most comprehensive
trading partnerships---as well as in defense, security, and
intelligence-sharing. **Three-quarters** of Canada's exports go to the
United States, most of which are part of the production processes for
American businesses]{.underline}. For example, Canadian softwood pulp is
prized in American toilet paper manufacturing, but tariffs could now
cause shortages. Decoupling from this relationship will challenge both
sides, but Canada also faces internal destabilization.

Trump's actions came amid a political crisis in Canada. Former prime
minister Justin Trudeau stepped down on January 6, triggering a Liberal
Party leadership race. Widely expected to lose the next election, the
party reversed negative approval ratings in selecting Mark Carney, a
former central bank governor of both Canada and England who promptly
called a vote for April 28. On the other side of the aisle, Alberta
Premier Danielle Smith suggested that Trump's tariffs played a role in
the Liberal Party's new fortunes. She asked the U.S. administration to
put its measures "on pause" such that a politician more "in sync" with
Republican views could win the election, referencing Conservative Party
leader Pierre Poilievre. Smith's admission to Breitbart News stoked
fears of foreign election interference, hot off a public inquiry into
the practice during the 2021 federal election. But it also highlighted
domestic political tensions that make mounting a collective response to
tariffs challenging.

[Canadian federalism divides the government's powers into two
jurisdictions, with the federal government responsible for the entire
country and the provinces for their regions and
populations]{.underline}. Traditionally, this setup requires a delicate
balance between the two levels of government. Discontent in the west of
Canada has been festering, with nearly half of Albertans believing their
province is getting less from federalism in Canada than it is giving to
other provinces. [A quarter of Albertans want independence, and 22
percent want to join the United States. Some are running Facebook groups
supporting the latter idea. So, although the Canadian federal government
responds to these tariffs, it must do so in conjunction with the
providences, which may have other ideas.]{.underline}

Oil exports are one example of a tariff response that would be
politically toxic. [Canada is the **top exporter** of crude **oil** to
the United States, accounting for **60 percent** of all imports in
2023]{.underline}. However, most Canadian crude oil comes from Alberta,
and Smith is unwilling to jeopardize those exports. Moreover, Smith has
issued demands to Carney, including having "full access to unfettered
oil and gas corridors to the north, east, and west," while raising the
specter of an independence referendum for the province after the federal
election. Others, such as former Reform Party of Canada leader Preston
Manning, have gone further. Manning suggested Alberta could secede if
Carney wins the upcoming election. Moreover, political rhetoric on the
right of Canada's political spectrum has mirrored that in the United
States, deepening divides across party lines.

If oil tariffs are out, what other options remain?

Federally, Canada announced a wave of countertariffs on American
products. Officials tried to compromise, too, announcing investments in
border security and hiring a so-called fentanyl czar to address Trump's
purported reason for introducing the tariffs. It's hard to fix a problem
that isn't there, though: In 2024, just 43 pounds of fentanyl crossed
from Canada, accounting for 0.2 percent of the total amount seized at
American borders.

Provincial and territory leaders have also responded. Most moved quickly
to remove American alcohol from stores, and some, including Alberta,
deprioritized or banned American companies from bidding on public
projects. Ontario Premier Doug Ford threatened to tax electricity
exports and end a \$70 million contract with Elon Musk's Starlink.

Canada could overhaul its domestic market. Some policies, such as health
and safety regulations, have been left to the provinces, resulting in
trade barriers that impede the movement of goods and services between
provinces and territories. One way to compensate for the losses caused
by tariffs is to foster free trade within Canada by removing these
barriers.

Another option is to deepen ties with the European Union and even seek
membership. Technicalities aside, it's not out of the question. Indeed,
as Canada seeks to bolster defenses independent from the United States,
it is already turning to the European Union to participate in its
defense industry. Moreover, Carney has also indicated that Canada is
prepared to replace the United States as a world leader in fostering
democracy and free trade.

[Predicting Canada's longer-term response is challenging, especially
given the upcoming election]{.underline}. Candidates are currently
announcing campaign promises, with many focusing on shoring up domestic
industries and supporting workers. [Although Trump's actions have shaken
Canadians out of a long-held complacency born from a massive market next
door, it's an open question whether Ottawa's elite has the creativity
and wherewithal to diversify the economy. The fact remains that
**geography ties** Canada to the United States, and pragmatism suggests
a **functional relationship** is **necessary**]{.underline}. Likewise,
hope remains that a future administration south of the border will have
a better attitude toward Canada.

### 2AC -- AT: No Permafrost Pathogen

#### Permafrost pathogens cause viral epidemics

It has thus become crucial for scientists to find ways to combat climate
change-driven deterioration and the potential effects it may have on the
healthcare system. Researchers might contribute to this cause by
focusing on the mechanisms of action of permafrost-preserved pathogens.
Intriguingly, it has been proposed that the process by which these
pathogens are preserved in frozen ground includes the lowering of their
freezing point due to high ionic strength within pore water. This
property of pore water also preserves the cell viability of these
microbes\[2\]. Moreover, cold environments slow down cell metabolism and
the rates of nutrient uptake, thereby allowing cryophiles to conserve
energy. [Permafrost is thus an ideal reservoir for pathogenic
organisms]{.underline}\[5\]. Furthermore, [the melting of permafrost
that is \~30 years old poses a **considerable risk** to global public
health, due to its potential to release pathogens]{.underline} that may
have been previously confined there. [Some of these microbial pathogens
include herpesvirus, rotavirus, and enterovirus, which are known to
sustain their viability after freezing and thawing]{.underline}. [These
various, diverse permafrost microbes and their release into the
atmosphere, subsequent to increased global warming, have led to
increasing outbreaks of bacterial and **viral epidemics** in circumpolar
regions]{.underline}\[6,7\].

Thermokarst lakes form as the results of ice-rich permafrost thawing,
and act as important water resources in cold regions. The results of a
recent study have revealed that both sediment and water of the
thermokarst lakes in the [Yellow River Source Area harbor diverse
antibiotic resistance genes, most of which belong to efflux pump,
suggesting that the **microbial resistances are intrinsic and
ubiquitous** in this pristine system]{.underline}\[8\]. A detailed
genome analysis of the Acinetobacter lwoffii bacteria isolated from
permafrost thaw, has shown that the pathogen is resistant to widely used
antibiotics such as streptomycin, spectinomycin, chloramphenicol, and
tetracycline\[9\]. It has been hypothesized that [these pathogens
**would not be detected** by modern tests, due to the different genetic
makeup of archaebacteria]{.underline}. The same reasoning can apply to a
potential reason as to why they are resistant to most commonly used
drugs. [These findings pose a cause of concern, as **modern pharmacology
systems are not well adapted to treating these diseases**, and global
warming can only be slowed down, at bes]{.underline}

[Permafrost thawing releases several viable strains of microbes against

**epidemics**]{.underline} in nearby circumpolar regions. A well-known
example is that of [Bacillus anthracis]{.underline} since its spores can
endure harsh freezing conditions; in 2016, there [was an anthrax

**[This phenomenon may also cause viral epidemics]{.underline}**. A

are then linked with human exposure via long-distance atmospheric
transport, which may be facilitated by air pollutant particulates\[6\].
Influenzavirus, in particular, is disseminated via various biotic and
abiotic means, a common biotic example being aquatic birds\[7\].
Permafrost may also be the source of calicivirus and enteroviruses (e.g.
poliovirus, echovirus, and coxsackievirus) outbreaks in circumpolar
regions since their permafrost deposits have been discovered and they
are readily transmitted by contaminating water sources\[7\].

With the [Arctic warming **3 to 4 times faster** than the rest of the
world, permafrost thaw has become a significant climate
threat.]{.underline} Scientists estimate that permafrost contains [1.4
trillion tonnes of carbon, an amount more than double what is currently
in the Earth's atmosphere. That carbon sink is stable as long as it
stays frozen]{.underline}, but with recent and projected thaw, the
organic matter in permafrost is breaking down and releasing carbon
dioxide and methane into the atmosphere, increasing the rate of climate
change.

What we're doing

A[ddressing this issue requires extensive **data collection on
permafrost** emissions, as well as equitable strategies for adaptation
by Arctic communities. To tackle this issue, Woodwell has partnered with
the Arctic Initiative at Harvard Kennedy School, the Alaska Institute
for Justice, and the Alaska Native Science Commission to connect experts
in climate science, human rights, and public policy with frontline
communities and high-level decision makers.]{.underline} The partnership
is pioneering a six-year research program called Permafrost Pathways
that will develop action plans to address the compounding impacts of
permafrost thaw.

Research area

Arctic

Permafrost thaw is an issue that affects everyone.

[With the **understanding** that this needs to be a **sustainable
process** with long-term impact, Permafrost Pathways' scientists are
expanding and coordinating a pan-Arctic carbon monitoring network to
**improve the accuracy** of permafrost thaw emissions estimates. More
precise measurements will fill critical data gaps and reduce
uncertainties, so that permafrost emissions can be factored into global
carbon budgets, climate models, targets, and **measures for mitigation
and adaptation**]{.underline}. That, combined with high-resolution
satellite and aircraft-based observations and advanced computer
modeling, will allow for tracking the changing landscape in near
real-time and more accurately projecting future emissions.

Permafrost Pathways is also collaborating with local communities to
co-create Indigenous-led adaptation strategies. For many, relocation or
infrastructure upgrades are needed urgently, but there is currently no
process or resources to enable communities to move forward. With Arctic
residents already feeling the brunt of climate change, the involvement
of frontline communities is crucial in developing successful adaptation
plans and effective policies.

[Global warming will thaw about 20% more permafrost than previously
thought, scientists have warned---potentially releasing significant
amounts of greenhouse gases into the Earth\'s atmosphere.]{.underline}

A new international research study, including climate change experts
from the University of Leeds, University of Exeter and the Met Office,
reveals that permafrost is more sensitive to the effects of global
warming than previously thought.

The study, published today in Nature Climate Change, suggests that
nearly 4 million square kilometres of frozen soil---an area larger than
India---could be lost for every additional degree of global warming
experienced.

Permafrost is frozen soil that has been at a temperature of below 0ºC
for at least two years. Large quantities of carbon are stored in organic
matter trapped in the icy permafrost soils. When permafrost thaws the
organic matter starts to decompose, releasing greenhouse gases such as
carbon dioxide and methane which increase global temperatures.

It is estimated that there is more carbon contained in the frozen
permafrost than is currently in the atmosphere.

Thawing permafrost has potentially damaging consequences, not just for
greenhouse gas emissions, but also the stability of buildings located in
high-latitude cities.

Roughly 35 million people live in the permafrost zone, with three cities
built on continuous permafrost along with many smaller communities. A
widespread thaw could cause the ground to become unstable, putting roads
and buildings at risk of collapse.

Recent studies have shown that the Arctic is warming at around twice the
rate as the rest of the world, with permafrost already starting to thaw
across large areas.

The researchers, from Sweden and Norway as well as the UK, suggest that
the huge permafrost losses could be averted if ambitious global climate
targets are met.

Lead-author Dr Sarah Chadburn of the University of Leeds said: \"A lower
stabilisation target of 1.5ºC would save approximately two million
square kilometres of permafrost.

[Achieving the ambitious Paris Agreement climate targets could limit
permafrost loss. For the first time we have calculated how much could be
saved.\"]{.underline}

[In the study, researchers used a novel combination of global climate
models and observed data to deliver a robust estimate of the global loss
of permafrost under climate change.]{.underline}

The team looked at the way that permafrost changes across the landscape,
and how this is related to the air temperature. [They then considered
possible increases in air temperature in the future, and converted these
to a permafrost distribution map using their observation-based
relationship. This allowed them to **calculate the amount** of
**permafrost** that would be lost under proposed **climate
stabilisation** targets.]{.underline}

As co-author Professor Peter Cox of the University of Exeter explained:
\"We found that the current pattern of permafrost reveals the
sensitivity of permafrost to global warming.\"

The study suggests that permafrost is more susceptible to global warming
that previously thought, as stabilising the climate at 2ºC above
pre-industrial levels would lead to thawing of more than 40% of today\'s
permafrost areas.

Co-author Dr Eleanor Burke, from the Met Office Hadley Centre, said:
\"The advantage of our approach is that permafrost loss can be estimated
for any policy-relevant global warming scenario.

\"[The ability to more accurately assess permafrost loss can hopefully
feed into a **greater understanding** of the impact of global warming
and potentially inform global warming policy]{.underline}.\"

#### Animals and plants in the arctic slow melting

**Oxford 20** \[Oxford University, 1/27/2020, Rewilding the Arctic could

The wide-scale introduction of large herbivores to the Arctic tundra to
restore the 'mammoth steppe' grassland ecosystem and mitigate global
warming is economically viable, suggests a new paper from the University
of Oxford.

[Grazing animals such as horses and bison are known to engineer the
landscape around them, for example suppressing the growth of trees by
trampling or eating saplings.]{.underline} When this process is
harnessed to [**restore** an **ecosystem** to a previous state it is
called rewilding. It can also be used to change one ecosystem into a
different but more desirable state. This is referred to as megafaunal
ecosystem engineering.]{.underline}

In many parts of the world, [forest ecosystems are considered the most
important to restore due to their ability to **store carbon**. But in
the Arctic tundra shifting the landscape from woody vegetation to
grassland would enhance the protection of the carbon-rich permafrost,
reduce carbon emissions associated with permafrost thaw and increase
carbon capture in the soil]{.underline}.

This grassland ecosystem -- called the 'mammoth steppe' -- existed
during the Pleistocene period, but was lost when large herbivores such
as woolly mammoths went extinct. [**Horses** and **bison** could act as
**eco-engineers** to transform present day tundra back to grassland. By
removing woody vegetation, enhancing grass growth, and trampling on snow
in search of winter forage]{.underline}, large mammals increase the
amount of incoming solar energy that bounces back to space -- known as
albedo. Grasslands also favour the [**capture of carbon in the deep
roots** of grasses, and enable cold winter temperatures to penetrate
deeper into the soil. Altogether, these changes would have a net cooling
effect on Arctic lands and **delay permafrost melt**]{.underline}.

"The Arctic is already changing, and fast. Taking a 'do nothing'
approach now is a decision to allow rapid, irreversible changes to
occur," says lead author Dr Marc Macias-Fauria, head of the
Biogeosciences Group at the School of Geography & the Environment.
"Although the science of Arctic eco-engineering is largely untested, it
has the potential to make a big difference and action in this region
should be given serious consideration."

The Oxford-led study estimates that carbon emissions from thawing
permafrost could be around 4.35 billion metric tonnes per year over the
21st century. This is around half as much as fossil fuels emissions and
three times more than estimates of the emissions produced by current and
projected land use change.

"Considering land use strategies aimed at protecting the Arctic
permafrost has similar implications for climate change as land use
decisions in other regions which currently receive much more attention,"
explained Professor Yadvinder Malhi, leader of the Ecosystems Group at
the Environmental Change Institute. "We are not used to thinking about
the Arctic in this way."

The Pleistocene Park, a family-run grassland restoration project
currently operating in north-easternmost Russia, has already shown
promising results. But the paper highlights that the scale of [**animal
introductions** needed to have a **significant impact** on Arctic tundra
and therefore global climate poses a significant challenge. As a
starting point there is now a need for large experiments at the
interface of science and practice]{.underline}.

The fossil record has been used to estimate that in the Pleistocene, 1
mammoth, 5 bison, 7.5 horses, 15 reindeer, 0.25 cave lions, and 1 wolf
per square kilometre roamed the area -- around the animal density of
present-day African savanna game reserves. Rewilding efforts would
initially focus on bison and horses. Researchers cost the introduction
and monitoring of three large-scale experimental areas consisting of
1,000 animals each at US\$114 million over a period of 10 years. On a
yearly basis, these areas would be able keep up to 72,000 tonnes of
carbon in the ground and generate US\$360,000 in carbon revenues alone,
increasing once the research phase was conducted and scaling enabled
more cost-efficient practices. Returns could be significantly higher if
Arctic countries introduced carbon tax and pricing mechanisms, and the
study constitutes a potential opportunity for UK-Russia cooperation on
climate change mitigation. The logistics, costs and social
considerations necessary to rewild the Arctic would be a monumental task
-- but the climate payoff could be mammoth.

Eco-engineering is one example of a natural climate solution, part of
the wider framework of [**'nature-based solutions'**. The concept of
nature-based solutions broadly refers to working with and enhancing
nature to help **address** societal **challenges**, and is rapidly
gaining traction around the world.]{.underline}

[In a recent study, Jonathan Bamber and his team at the University of

an area larger than 4,000 football fields.]{.underline}

So they're receding at an alarming rate.

Bamber: "And in particular over the last two decades that rate has
increased for most of those glaciers."

It's a worrisome preview of how dramatically climate change will affect
other massive glaciers as temperatures continue to rise.

[And when glaciers melt into the ocean, seas rise globally -- so what's
happening to remote glaciers will affect coastal

#### It's thumped -- AI has been in the Arctic for years, and isn't used for deterrence

**Bowler et al. 23** (British Antarctic Survey, November 2023: How is AI
being used for good in the Arctic?,

The Arctic, a region characterised by its extreme cold, vast icy
landscapes, and unique ecosystems, is facing significant challenges due
to rapid climate change and increasing human activity. [While these
challenges pose threats to the delicate balance of the Arctic
environment, advancements in artificial intelligence **(AI) have emerged
as a powerful tool to monitor,** predict, and mitigate these
challenges.]{.underline}

[From sea ice prediction to wildlife conservation**, AI is making a
positive impact in the Arctic**, offering hope for a more sustainable
and resilient future for this critical ecosystem.]{.underline}

**[Sea Ice Prediction]{.underline}**

Every week, billions of people worldwide rely on meteorological
forecasts to make choices -- ranging from what clothes to wear, to
deciding whether to flee a hurricane. In the Arctic, people and wildlife
must contend with changing sea ice conditions as well as extreme
weather. The frozen Arctic oceans act as a vital platform for hunting,
travel, and cultural activities for coastal Indigenous peoples, and play
a critical role in maintaining Arctic food webs. [Declining sea ice
levels due to global warming have already had devastating impacts which
will only increase as warming progresses, and the thinner ice pack is
more weather driven and tougher to predict]{.underline}.

The Arctic has an urgent need for accurate forecasts of sea ice to
supplement weather forecasts. H[owever, the complexity of sea ice has
proved a stumbling block for traditional physics-based numerical models,
limiting their ability to provide meaningful decision support for Arctic
communities.]{.underline}

[Together at British Antarctic Survey and The Alan Turing Institute, we
are collaborating on IceNet, a cutting edge project aiming to address
the impact of climate change on the Arctic using an **AI sea ice
forecasting system**]{.underline}. The IceNet AI uses satellite data and
weather observations to forecast pan-Arctic 25km2 sea ice concentration
on a daily timescale up to several months ahead, which can allow Arctic
residents to prepare and adapt to changing conditions.

[Map]{.underline}

An example IceNet forecast, predicting sea ice concentration 21 days
ahead from the 20 July initialisation date. IceNet's pan-Arctic 25km2
sea ice concentration forecast closely matches the true observations
from 10 August. [IceNet produces a forecast map on a daily timescale for
up to 93 days into the future, allowing improved decision-making for
Arctic organisations and communities.]{.underline}

[The **system uses advanced AI techniques** that mine decades of
observations, supplemented by the intelligent fusion of centuries of
past and future climate simulations, to **learn how sea ice evolves over
time**.]{.underline} This approach has proved remarkably effective: an
earlier version of IceNet outperformed the leading physics-based system
in notoriously difficult seasonal summer forecasts; these findings were
published in Nature Communications in 2021.

[Wildlife Conservation]{.underline}

[O**ne of the significant areas where AI is making a difference in the
Arctic is wildlife conservation and protection**. With the help of
cutting-edge **sensors and advanced AI** technologies , researchers and
conservationists are now able to monitor and track the movement of
Arctic species such as polar bears, Arctic foxes, and marine
mamma]{.underline}ls. [AI is now routinely applied to **camera and
satellite imagery**]{.underline} to automate information extraction in
order to aid research on animal behaviour, ocean health, population
dynamics, and habitat changes, enabling scientists to develop effective
conservation strategies and policies to protect species at risk from the
impacts of climate change and human activities.

The IceNet team is now turning their research into action in several
ways. Research software engineers at BAS and Turing have developed a
powerful digital infrastructure for IceNet, allowing the system to be
trained faster, run in real-time, and offer a host of possibilities for
useful applications, such as operation planning, analysis of
environmental events, and environmentally responsible maritime
navigation.

The IceNet team is collaborating with the Government of Nunavut (GN) and
the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) to explore the use of IceNet as an
early warning system for Arctic conservation. This has led to a
proof-of-concept 'conservation early warning and alert system' for
Dolphin and Union Caribou migrations (video below), a species considered
endangered by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in
Canada.

March 2023 saw [IceNet's first real-time application, where its
forecasts around Lancaster Sound in Canada were used to aid a
large-scale polar bear survey, which the GN biologist lead described as
"incredibly informative"]{.underline}. The actions of the team prove
their commitment to using their expertise to empower the North with
cutting-edge technology for mitigating climate change impacts.

[Integrating Indigenous Knowledge]{.underline}

In 2021, [PolArctic successfully completed a pioneering project in
Sanikiluaq, Nunavut, Canada, combining Indigenous Knowledge with
cutting-edge AI, scientific research, and satellite data.]{.underline}

By integrating traditional Inuit knowledge, scientific data, and remote
sensing techniques, the project identified untapped fishing locations,
mitigating the impact of changing climate patterns on fish availability.
This pioneering initiative, funded by the Nunavut Fishery Association,
Qikiqtaaluk Corporation, and WWF, laid the groundwork for sustainable
and adaptable mariculture solutions in the Arctic.

The project showcased the significance of merging Indigenous and western
knowledge systems, overcoming data limitations posed by the Arctic's
unique environmental conditions. Leveraging the Nunavut Coastal Resource
Inventory (NCRI) and various satellite sources, [PolArctic's **AI model
facilitated informed decision-making** for the local mariculture
industry, offering insights into habitat changes and growth
conditions]{.underline}. By providing vital information in both
Inuktitut and English, [the AI not only supported research planning and
economic exploration but also informed infrastructure development,
paving the way for economic growth and job opportunities within the
community.]{.underline}

Looking ahead, the initiative's success points to the possibility of
replicating this collaborative approach across the Arctic, emphasising
the transformative potential of integrating human and technological
intelligence to address pressing environmental challenges.

[Search and Rescue Operations]{.underline}

The harsh and unpredictable conditions in the Arctic pose significant
challenges for search and rescue operations. AI-ARC -- a consortium of
22 partners, including the UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency -- is
developing an AI based virtual control room for the Arctic, which will
enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of search and rescue missions
in the Arctic.

[**AI and drone technology is also being used for search and rescue** in
Canada. By analysing real-time data on weather conditions, ice
movements, and geographical terrains, AI algorithms can assist in
identifying optimal routes and locations for rescue operations, thus
saving valuable time and resources and increasing the chances of
successful rescues in this challenging environment.]{.underline}

Where next for IceNet?

We have ambitious plans to expand IceNet's forecasting capabilities. For
example, the current 25 km2 spatial forecast scale isn't high enough
resolution many real-world applications. By leveraging more recent,
higher resolution passive microwave and radar-based satellite data, the
team are planning to use AI 'transfer learning' to increase spatial
resolution by a factor of four or greater. This would provide
substantially more value to forecast users.

Alongside improved accuracy and resolution of the AI system, the project
team are working to improve user interfaces for conservation workers,
robustness of early warning systems, and the real-time and historical
forecast analysis tools. The IceNet infrastructure is now being expanded
to provide increased levels of interoperability providing better
integration possibilities for downstream services and users.

Sea ice conditions dictate the accessibility and safety of shipping, a
key mode of transport for Arctic activity. BAS is developing an
automated route planning platform to minimise vessel's carbon impact in
ice-covered polar oceans by avoiding ice breaking. Accurate sea ice
forecasts will be critical for automated routing and decision support
for maritime activity and conservation in polar waters. The IceNet team
is keen to ensure the AI technology is used as a force for good,
supporting maritime, scientific and conservation uses.

As we move towards the 5th International Polar Year in 2032-33 -- and a
once in a generation focus on new international polar research -- there
is clear potential for the considered use of AI and machine learning to
take a major new role. To scale up the reach and impact of research, as
well as acting as a bridge between traditional research from scientists
and Indigenous people's ways of knowing.

[The application of AI in the Arctic is fostering innovative solutions
that address critical environmental, social, and economic challenges. By
combining technological advancements with scientific research and
community engagement, **AI is playing a crucial role in** protecting the
fragile **Arctic** ecosystem and supporting sustainable development in
the region. As we continue to harness the rapidly developing power of
AI, it is imperative to ensure that these technologies are deployed in a
responsible and ethical manner, prioritising the long-term well-being of
the Arctic and its inhabitants. In showing that AI can be used for good,
we can work towards a more sustainable and resilient future for the
Arctic and the planet]{.underline}.

Modern suppression capabilities relying on sophisticated communications,
rapid attack, specialized equipment, and many fire fighters are a far
cry from the early 1900s. Fire protection has succeeded in reducing the
extent of fire and increasing fire intervals. Chandler and others (1983)
suggested that [as protection succeeds, fire intervals become greater
**and flammability increases**]{.underline}. Then, [**more protection is
needed** to keep burned acreage down.]{.underline} A given protection
effort and annual burned area will eventually reach equilibrium. Since
the 1980s, the costs of protection and greater understanding of the role
of fire have led to more hazard reduction and ecosystem maintenance
rather than just protection.

[For the past 100 years]{.underline} or so, human use of fire--- earlier
termed **[controlled burning]{.underline}** and now prescribed fire and
wildland fire use---[has met with **considerable controversy**
politically and within land management organizations]{.underline}.
"Light burning" (understory fire) was once widely applied in the
southern pines and ponderosa pine type especially in California.
However, [the perceived threat to effective organized fire control
largely curtailed the program]{.underline} on publicly owned lands (Pyne
1982). Some benefits of controlled burning were still recognized,
especially hazard reduction and preparation of seed beds for
regeneration. In the West justification for prescribed fire was fuel
reduction, namely slash burning. [This single purpose use of prescribed
fire resulted in short-term successes but long-term failure to optimize
societal objectives for forests]{.underline} (Agee 1993).

#### Controlled burning fails -- benefits are limited and it often exacerbates issues

The use of prescribed fire---intentionally setting fires in forests and
other ecosystems under planned circumstances---has received increased
attention in California and elsewhere in recent years. On the one hand,
it is good that there is growing recognition that fire is a natural and
necessary part of forests and other ecosystems. On the other hand,
current advocacy for large-scale prescribed fire across vast areas is
often built on outdated assumptions and overstated claims, while
downplaying problems stemming from how prescribed fire is actually being
implemented. This factsheet identifies five key sets of myths regarding
prescribed fire and shows how they can lead to misguided policies and
missed opportunities to better accomplish public safety and ecological
restoration goals in a more cost-effective manner. To create effective
fire policies, we need to face these facts---[**Prescribed fire
increases fire and smoke**. Prescribed fire is **inefficient for public
safety** compared to home retrofits. Prescribed fire **is inefficient
for ecological restoration compared to managed wildfire**. Prescribed
fire can be harmful]{.underline}. And prescribed fire and cultural
burning are not the same. Prescribed fire increases fire and smoke. [A
central myth is that increasing prescribed fire will lead to less fire
and smoke overall.]{.underline} Proponents of prescribed fire highlight
**[examples where a portion of a wildfire halted when it encountered a
previously burned area]{.underline}**, but these anecdotes **[are the
exception rather than the rule]{.underline}**. The reality is that
wildfires can burn through previously burned areas as soon as eight
months after the prior fire (Stephens and Moghaddas 2005). Over 106,000
acres within the 2020 LNU Lightning Complex in California had burned
within the previous five years, with 67,000 acres having burned just two
years prior. As fire researchers have stated, "fuel treatments are not
intended to stop wildfires" (Omi and Martinson 2004). Instead, the main
goal of prescribed fire is to somewhat alter subsequent fire intensity
in the affected area, though that may not occur under unfavorable
weather conditions. In other words, prescribed fire is additive to,
rather than being a substitute for, wildfire. Even in instances where
prescribed fire has been found to limit wildfire extent, the acreage of
a prescribed burn significantly exceeds the acreage of subsequent
wildfire reduction, with 3-4 units of prescribed fire needed to reduce
wildfire by one unit (Fernandes 2015). Furthermore, the effects of
prescribed fire on wildfire behavior fade within a few years. Within as
little as 2 or 3 years after prescribed fire, combustible understory
vegetation can return to levels equal to or greater than levels prior to
prescribed burning (Knapp et al. 2007). Thus, prescribed fires would
need to be reapplied on a regular basis, repeatedly adding fire to many
places that otherwise might not encounter a wildfire until many years in
the future. For all these reasons, [increased use of **prescribed fire
will likely lead to a net increase in the total amount of
fire**]{.underline} (Hunter and Robles 2020). [With that additional fire
comes **additional smoke**. Proposals to implement landscape-wide
prescribed fire could result in ten times as much smoke]{.underline}
(Hanson 2021; see also p. 12 in this report). In addition to increasing
the total amount of smoke, increasing prescribed fire also increases the
duration of smoke exposure. While wildfire smoke is concentrated in the
height of fire season---and landscape-scale use of prescribed fire would
not preclude this---prescribed fires are typically lit in the "shoulder
seasons" when wildfires are less likely, and thus prescribed fires
prolong smoke exposure into times when it would not otherwise occur.
There can be circumstances where it is appropriate to use prescribed
fire, but it should be done knowing that the effect will be an overall
increase in the amount and duration of fire and smoke. Landscape-wide
prescribed fire could result in ten times as much smoke. (Source: USFS)
Landscape-wide prescribed fire could result in ten times as much smoke.
(Source: USFS) Prescribed fire is inefficient for public safety compared
to home retrofits. [Prescribed fire is an inefficient and relatively
ineffective way to protect homes and communities during
wildfires]{.underline}. As Dr. David Lindemayer recently summarized,
"The peer-reviewed evidence is that burning forest miles from houses
doesn't protect those houses" (Foley 2021). As discussed above,
[prescribed fires **generally do not stop subsequent wildfires**, and
altering fire intensity is largely irrelevant to community
safety]{.underline} because home ignitions during wildfires are rarely
caused by direct contact with high-intensity fire (Cohen and Stratton
2008, Syphard et al. 2017). Instead, home fire-safety retrofits ("home
hardening") offer the most effective ways to keep communities safe
during wildfire. Yet the resources to help communities with fire-safety
retrofits are currently quite limited compared to the government funding
for prescribed fire and associated "fuel treatments" in wildlands. For
example, in California's 2021 proposed budget for wildfire preparedness,
less than 4% of the funding is directed to "community hardening" (LAO
2021). While prescribed burning adjacent to communities can potentially
have some benefits, proposals to use large-scale prescribed fire across
vast landscapes away from communities represent a remarkably indirect
and inefficient way to protect houses when compared with the direct
benefits of home retrofits. Prescribed fire is inefficient for
ecological restoration compared to managed wildfire. One positive
outcome of the greater attention on prescribed fire is that it has
contributed to growing recognition that fire is a necessary part of
forests and other ecosystems, and that currently many forests have a
shortage of fire compared to levels prior to modern fire suppression.
Unfortunately, many advocates for prescribed fire rely on an outdated
"good fire/bad fire" dichotomy that is out of step with the science. In
this false dichotomy, prescribed fires are characterized as "good"
because they are associated with low-intensity fire, whereas wildfires
are characterized as "bad" because they are associated with
mixed-intensity fire that includes some areas of high-intensity fire.
However, there is a growing body of research showing that high-intensity
fire has always been a part of forests and other ecosystems, and it
produces ecological benefits by creating excellent wildlife habitat and
stimulating nutrient cycling (DellaSala and Hanson 2015). In contrast,
low-intensity fire associated with prescribed burning does not generate
the habitat creation and the nutrient cycling associated with
higher-intensity fire. Each type of fire intensity has its role in a
mixed-intensity fire regime, and low-intensity fire is not a substitute
for the benefits from some higher-intensity effects in forests.
High-intensity fire has always been a part of forests and other
ecosystems, and it produces ecological benefits (Source Doug Bevington)
High-intensity fire has always been a part of forests and other
ecosystems, and it produces ecological benefits (Source: Doug Bevington)
Another myth repeated by some prescribed advocates is the erroneous
notion that forests that previously experienced fire suppression will
now "burn up" in all or mainly high-intensity fire when a wildfire
occurs, unless those forests first get prescribed fire or other "fuel
treatments." But multiple studies have shown that areas that experience
wildfire following long periods of fire suppression still burn mainly at
low and moderate intensity, along with some high-intensity patches that
provide the benefits described above (Odion and Hanson 2008, Miller et
al. 2012). In fact, research has found that forests with the longest
fire exclusion actually burn at somewhat lower intensity (Odion et al.
2010). This is exciting news for efforts at ecological restoration
because it means that large-scale prescribed fire or other "treatments"
are not needed as a precondition to allowing mixed-intensity wildfire
back into forests. Instead, managed wildfire offers a much more
efficient way to restore fire to forests that currently have a shortage
of fire, and this has economic and practical benefits. Managed wildfire
(also known as wildland fire use) differs from fire suppression in that,
rather than trying only to extinguish a wildfire, fire managers seek to
shepherd the fire away from communities and into wildland areas where
the fire will provide ecological benefits. This is less intensive and
costly than full suppression. Likewise, managed wildfire differs from
prescribed fire because the latter has an extensive planning process and
often quite restrictive parameters before a prescribed fire ignition can
occur, whereas managed wildfire works with natural fire ignitions to
provide more fire where it is needed in a more expeditious manner. This
is not to say that prescribed fire does not have a role in fire policy,
but instead that role has been overstated. Prescribed fire is a useful
tool when there are special circumstances where fine-scale control over
fire is needed. In this regard, prescribed fire has a role equivalent to
the role of a watering can. A watering can is a good tool for tending
the plants around your house, but if you are faced with a dry field in
need of irrigation, it would be absurd to propose buying thousands of
watering cans. Yet this is basically equivalent to current proposals
relying mainly on prescribed fire to restore fire to vast areas.
Instead, the right way to water a large field is through large-scale
irrigation---a river, not a watering can---and the most efficient way to
restore fire to large landscapes is through managed wildfire. Yet,
despite its benefits, managed wildfire currently gets surprisingly
little attention in current fire policy discussions, compared to
prescribed fire. Prescribed fire can be harmful. Prescribed fire is
sometimes called "good fire" by its proponents, but the reality is that,
while it can be useful in some circumstances, [prescribed fire can also
cause ecological damage]{.underline}. One example is when prescribed
fire policies get applied to non-forest ecosystems such as chaparral,
Great Basin sagebrush, or pinyon-juniper woodlands. Research over the
past few decades has established that these ecosystems naturally and
historically burned infrequently, with several decades or even centuries
between fires (Floyd et al. 2004, Baker 2006, Mensing 2006, Keeley and
Zedler 2009, Baker and Halsey 2020). In these ecosystems, the use of
prescribed fire can shorten fire-free intervals needed for slow-growing
shrubs to re-establish, and such fire conducted outside of the natural
fire season can inhibit seed germination for many species while favoring
growth of non-native plants that can be more flammable (Parker 1987, Le
Fer and Parker 2005, Baker 2006, Syphard et al. 2006). Prescribed fire
[can also be harmful in forests, especially when done outside of the
main fire season]{.underline}. Wildlife have evolved strategies to
coexist with summer forest fires, but prescribed fires are often lit in
the spring when bird eggs and nesting chicks cannot get away from fires
(Hanson 2021). There can also be significant ecological damage when
logging ("thinning") is treated as a prerequisite for prescribed fire.
On national forests, this means that Forest Service projects involving
prescribed fire can also include substantial amounts of logging that
damages wildlife habitat. Furthermore, logging results in cut vegetation
debris that then gets piled up and burned. The Forest Service is now
calling this pile burning "prescribed fire," but it causes sustained
burning in a concentrated location that can scorch and sterilize the
soil, and it does not produce the beneficial post-fire wildlife habitat
created during genuine forest fire restoration (Korb et al. 2004). In
light of these potential harms, projects involving prescribed fire
should not be exempted from proper environmental review. The Forest
Service is now calling pile burning 'prescribed fire,' but this
concentrated burning can sterilize the soil. (Source: USFS) The Forest
Service is now calling pile burning 'prescribed fire,' but this
concentrated burning can sterilize the soil. (Source: USFS) Prescribed
fire and cultural burning are not the same. As attention on prescribed
fire has grown in recent years, there has also been broader awareness
that Native Americans have long traditions of applying fire to the land
in practices known as cultural burning. Cultural burning was outlawed or
severely restricted when federal and state policymakers imposed their
wildfire suppression policies on Indigenous peoples. Now some Indigenous
groups seek to restore their ability to do more cultural burning.
Traditionally, burning has been done for a variety of purposes,
including stimulating the growth of plants that are particularly useful
to their communities, such as for basket-weaving or food production. In
this regard, traditional cultural burning is notably different from
current approaches to prescribed fire from the Forest Service and other
agencies that primarily focus on trying to suppress forest fire
intensity across vast areas. Yet, the Forest Service's approach to
prescribed fire often gets conflated with traditional cultural burning
in discussions of fire policy. This can result in cultural appropriation
that superimposes Forest Service goals on Tribal practices. The evidence
is clear that, prior to modern fire suppression policies, Native
American cultural burning and mixed-intensity forest fires were both
much more common than they are now (Odion et al. 2014, 2016, Vachula et
al. 2019, Wahl et al. 2019). They coexisted, and one did not preclude
the other. Both have been suppressed and marginalized by federal and
state agencies. Conclusion---The disappointing results of prescribed
fire When all is said and done, [the **actual results from** broad-scale
application of **prescribed fire would** likely **be
disappointing**]{.underline} for most people. Those who thought it would
reduce fire would instead experience more fire and smoke from
large-scale prescribed burning. Those who are concerned about public
safety would realize that communities would have been much safer if the
money used to subsidize backcountry prescribed fires and associated
"fuel treatments" had instead been focused on directly assisting with
fire-safety home retrofits as part of a home-outward strategy. Those who
want to help ecosystems would realize that managed wildfire offers a
more efficient and practical way to restore fire to forests, whereas
prescribed fire is often tied to increased logging. And those who want
to support Tribes' cultural burning would find traditional practices
getting appropriated by federal and state agencies. While prescribed
fire can have some benefits in special circumstances, it is important to
not overstate the role of prescribed fire---a watering can should not
pretend to be a river---or [**we risk missing more effective** and
cost-efficient **solutions** using managed wildfire, traditional
cultural burning, and home fire-safety retrofits.]{.underline}

Record wildfires were experienced in 2023 Wildfires have continued to
devastate regions around the world in 2024. This is consistent with
global trends and OECD data highlighting that 24.5% of globally burned
area between 2019 and 2023 was located in OECD and OECD partner
countries. In countries such as Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Colombia,
India and South Africa, more than 1% of land area burned each year
during this period. This represented more than 660 000 km2 -- roughly
equivalent to the size of France. Burning land, whether from wildfires,
[controlled burning]{.underline} or uncontrolled biomass fires, [has
far-reaching consequences that **hinder efforts to combat climate
change** and **undermine initiatives** aimed at mitigating global
warming]{.underline}. In the southern hemisphere, the Brazilian Amazon
has experienced its worst six months of wildfires in over 20 years due

Leda Kobziar, an associate professor of fire science and forest
conservation in UF's School of Forest Resources and Conservation, led a
web-based survey of 523 public and private land managers across Region 8
of the U.S. Forest Service, which consists of 13 Southern states,
including Florida. She and her colleagues wanted to see whether
front-line experts think prescribed burns prevent wildfires and maintain
vegetation and healthy ecosystems. And if they do, what are the
circumstances under which such burns work best.

As it turns out, prescribed burns should be done every few years to
prevent wildfires or reduce their severity, depending on weather and the
type of ecosystem land managers are trying to protect, according to the
survey.

"[Although managers reported increases in prescribed fire
use]{.underline} in the South over the last decade, [these **increases
have attenuated** in the last five years]{.underline}," Kobziar said.
Public land managers said [burning can be limited by staffing and
budget]{.underline}, while private [land managers were more concerned
about liability]{.underline}. "Even though prescribed burns cannot
prevent all wildfires, survey respondents agree that regular burning
helps reduce wildfire intensity and severity, and therefore cuts costs
and risks for firefighters and the public."

According to the survey, prescribed burns are conducted to restore
unhealthy ecosystems. A beneficial prescribed burn can minimize
flammable materials and the spread of pest insects and disease. It can
also improve habitat for threatened and endangered species, recycle
nutrients back to the soil and promote vegetation growth.

[As time passes, prescribed burns **lose their
effectiveness**]{.underline}, according to the UF study. If forest
managers wait five years or more between prescribed burns, only 10
percent said they saw reductions in wildfire in pine forests.

But [forest managers **can't** do prescribed burns]{.underline} as often
as they'd like [because of constraints such as weather and smoke

Agricultural Sciences faculty member. Another hurdle is the [proximity

prescribed burning can be expensive up front, burning at landscape scale
does help to reduce the per acre cost. Furthermore, it has the potential
to save money in the long run by improving forest health and by creating
mosaics which can help reduce the threats, and expense of, suppressing
catastrophic fires.

[Smoke management is an issue that is becoming increasingly
important]{.underline}. Currently, [quality regulations in Alaska in
general **are not very restrictive**]{.underline} with regard to
prescribed burning. However, Alaska is on the verge of implementing air
quality regulations which establish an emission fee of \$5.07 per ton of
assessable emissions. [There is still a question on applicability to

it will]{.underline} greatly [**increase the costs** of]{.underline}
landscape scale [prescribed burning]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
could [**adversely impact implementation** of plans]{.underline}. The
1993 prescribed fire on the Tetlin National Wildlife Refuge provides a
good case in point. Fuel consumption on that project was determined to
be 20.3 tons per acre, or 117,740 tons for the 5,800 acre burn (Ottmar,
personal communication). An estimated 1,766 tons of particulate would be
produced from the fire for an assessed emission fee of \$8,954 (Hardy,
personal communicationban emission factor of 30 lblton was used for this
estimate. This [emission fee would **double the cost** of
burning-increasing the base cost]{.underline} of \$1.50 per acre

The cost of a project would need to be assessed over its lifetime,
taking into account the entire gamut of expenses linked to financing,
construction and transactions related to tendering, negotiations and
monitoring projects. In this regard, the [evidence provided by various
academic researchers and international organizations suggests that PPPs
have often tended to be **more expensive** than the **alternative of
public procurement**.]{.underline}

To elaborate, [private sector **borrowing costs** often tend to be
higher than those of their public counterparts]{.underline} (with
sovereigns in particular being able to obtain finance on more favourable
terms). This is illustrated in studies by Romero (2015) and Hall (2015)
which, for example, cite a 2015 review by the UK's National Audit Office
(NAO) showing the effective interest rate of all private finance deals
(7%-- 8%) to be double that of all government borrowing (3%--4%),
implying a far greater burden on the public purse than if the government
had borrowed from private banks or issued bonds directly. At the same
time, [PPPs are typically **very complex** to **tender and negotiate**
and this, together with the fact that they are **frequently
renegotiated**, has often entailed **higher transactions
costs**.]{.underline} According to Hall (2015), the [transactions costs
of tendering and monitoring PPPs add]{.underline} 10-20 per cent [to
their costs]{.underline}, while the [cost of construction is higher
under a PPP because the financiers require a **turnkey
contract**]{.underline}, which is about 25 per cent more expensive. The
author argues that this is the case in both higher income and developing
countries alike.

The above findings of academic researchers are generally consistent with
the internal (staff research and independent) evaluations of various
institutions or organizations which promote PPPs. For example, a
European Investment Bank (Blanc-Brude, Goldsmith and Välilä 2006, p. 2)
report, which compares the cost of 227 new road sections across 15
European countries of which 65 were PPPs, "estimate that the [ex-ante
cost]{.underline} of a PPP road to be, on average, 24% [**more
expensive** than a traditionally procured road]{.underline}".

To these costs [must be added the potential **risks**, or contingent
fiscal liabilities]{.underline}, relating to PPPs. In [particular,
infrastructure projects are associated with various types of
risks]{.underline}. These include construction risks (e.g., design
problems, cost and time over-run); financial risks (e.g., interest rate
and exchange rate variations); availability risks (e.g., equipment
performance, quality of service); demand risks (variations in the
need/use of the service) and residual risks (future value of the project
when transferred to the government). The principle underlying a PPP is
that such [risks which are best managed by the private partner should be
allocated to the **private partner**]{.underline}. However, [assessing
risk transfer is difficult given the multitude of risks to which PPPs
are exposed and the **complexity of PPP contracts**]{.underline}. If the
[risk assumed by the private sector partner were to be **over-priced**,
it would increase the cost of the service to the consumer, making PPPs
unviable]{.underline}. The IMF has warned that [governments]{.underline}
may sometimes [exaggerate the **true value of risk transfer**, leading
to an **overpricing** of risk that raises the cost of PPPs relative to
direct public investment]{.underline}. On the other hand, quite often
the risk assumed by the private partner is under-priced and governments
are forced to extend a guarantee to cover the price differential. In
doing so, [governments can be left bearing an **unduly large share of
the risk** involved in a PPP and facing potentially **large fiscal
costs** over the medium term.]{.underline}

Overall, analyses by both the IMF and World Bank have expressed
[concerns regarding perverse incentives on the part of governments to
treat PPP contingent liabilities as "off balance sheet", which in turn
undermines sound fiscal management.]{.underline} According to Romero
(2015), the historical experience of several countries in the developed
and developing world shows that [PPPs can pose a huge financial risk to
the public sector.]{.underline} The author cites the much-discussed case
of recently built hospital in Lesotho to provide an illustrative example
of how a [seemingly successful PPP]{.underline} (based on traditional
project development criteria) [may have negative impacts on the
country's non-transparent contingent fiscal liabilities, and hence on
overall social development efforts]{.underline}. The newly-built,
425-bed hospital was the result of a public-private partnership,
facilitated by the IFC. A recent study (McIntosh et al. 2015, p. 960) of
the project, using quantitative measures that reflected capacity,
utilization, clinical quality, and patient outcomes, calls the project
successful and generally concludes "that health care public-private
partnerships may improve hospital performance in developing countries
and that changes in management and leadership practices might account
for differences in clinical outcomes". However, referring to the very
same project, an Oxfam study (2014) asserts that the [hospital threatens
to bankrupt]{.underline} the impoverished African country's health
budget, since more than half the country's entire health budget (51%) is
being spent on payments to the private consortium that built and runs
the hospital in the capital. The [PPP]{.underline} hospital
[cost]{.underline} US\$67 million per year -- [at least three times what
the old public hospital would have cost today, and it consumed more than
half of the total government health budget.]{.underline}

Accessed 7-22-2025; SM\]

Myth No. 2: "Let's go for a PPP so we (as government) don't have to work
too much in delivering the project.

[PPP deals require]{.underline} a lot of [political and technical effort
by governments]{.underline}, [to be delivered effectively]{.underline}.
First, during [PPP preparation]{.underline} (planning and assessments
prior to the tender) governments need to have qualified professionals
working together under an adequate governance structure. Second, during
contract management, governments need to have in place a team to
monitors service delivery, enforce contractual obligations and regulate
the financial aspects of the contract.

Third, [there is a need for **qualified political energy** to adequately
communicate the meaning of PPPs to society]{.underline}. The problem
about this myth is that [governments can embark on]{.underline}
expensive [PPP programs **that fail**]{.underline}s [to
deliver]{.underline} because they are not adequately resourced to deal
with the project cycle.

Myth No. 3: "We have this amazing new idea, let's turn it into a PPP and
sign the contract next month"

[If PPP projects are to be effective, they need to be carefully
identified and scoped]{.underline}, thoroughly appraised and
professionally structured, before they are taken to the market. This is
nothing beyond the truism that "planning pays-off." [The
process]{.underline}, however, [inevitably consumes time]{.underline}.
This myth builds pressure to expedite PPPs and skip specific appraisal
exercises, causing long-term contracts being signed without proper
assessments, such as value for money, positive cost/benefit outputs or
inadequate social or environmental impacts.

So, (1) [PPPs]{.underline} do not create fiscal space, (2) they
[require]{.underline} the commitment of **[sizable government
resources]{.underline}**, and (3) [PPPs **take time to be** designed and
**implemented**]{.underline}. Why are we thinking of PPPs in the first
place? Because they can capture the flexibility of the private sector,
align it to the government's objectives and improve the quality of risk
management in contracts in large scale infrastructure initiatives, in
ways that other procurement mechanisms cannot. This create value,
amplify our capacity to deliver quality infrastructure and optimizes
costs in the life-cycle of infrastructure assets.

Navigating the complexities of government regulation emerges as a

[What's holding private investors back]{.underline} from green projects?

Regulatory and policy uncertainty: [Uncertainty raises project revenue
risk]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} in turn, [reduces project
viability]{.underline}, [investment]{.underline}, private sector
[interest and innovation.]{.underline} Institutional [investors also
face]{.underline} significant [bureaucracy]{.underline} and onerous
reporting and disclosure requirements --- such as demonstrating that
investments satisfy regulatory criteria.

Poor incentives: Many green technologies have large upfront R&D costs
and long and risky development periods but only generate long-term
payback. And the potential for knowledge spillovers means investors only
earn a fraction of the total rate of return as benefits also accrue to
other companies.

Small, fragmented markets: [Investors are not always confident in
recouping large, risky up-front investments]{.underline} in R&D or new
production capacity [if the end market is small.]{.underline}

Lack of market data: [Without robust data, it can be hard to assess the
expected risks and benefits of investment]{.underline} --- especially
for smaller start-ups and new innovations. [This can push up the
cost]{.underline} [and]{.underline} may [limit access to external
finance]{.underline}.

[**PPP failures**: Private-public partnerships can **fail to deliver**
due to ill-defined outcomes, insufficient private sector capacity, and
**lack of expertise and experience** among both private and public
players. These can lead to poor planning, implementation delays and
project failure.]{.underline}

Unclear investment goals: With a lack of globally agreed principles for
climate finance, investors struggle to align investments with climate
goals. The EU has been the most progressive with its sustainable finance
taxonomy, which aims to support sustainable investment by clarifying the
economic activities that most contribute to meeting EU environmental
objectives.21

This year nearly 52,700 wildfires have already burned over 8.8 million
acres. The recent, devastating fires in California led to 23 deaths,
burned 245,000 acres, and destroyed over 8,700 structures. Insured
losses from the fire have already topped \$3 billion. [The growing
severity of the issue has brought it to lawmakers' attention and a
number of bills are making their way through Congress.]{.underline}

One such bill is the [Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017 (H.R.
2936).]{.underline} It [passed the House on November 1.]{.underline} The
bill calls for increased forest thinning through expanding the amount of
land that could be excluded from certain National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA) reviews, which would expedite forest projects. The bill also
has provisions designed to eliminate fire borrowing --- a practice where
the U.S. Forest Service taps funding from non-fire programs when fire
suppression funding has been exhausted. This results in taking funds
from other USFS programs, usually forest management programs that could
be used to help prevent future wildfires. The bill also seeks to rein in
lawsuits against the USFS by establishing an arbitration pilot program.
It would require opposing forest management activity to offer an
alternative forest management proposal instead of just rejecting the
initial proposal.

In the Senate, [Senator Barrasso (R-WY) introduced a bill (S.
2068]{.underline}) that would also work to increase and speed up
forest-thinning projects through establishing a categorical exclusion or
excluding certain types of activities from NEPA reviews, including
activities aimed at improving the habitat of the greater sage-grouse and
mule deer, addressing the forest health crisis, and prioritizing forest
management activities to achieve ecosystem restoration. This bill does
not include any provisions designed to combat fire borrowing.

[The Wildfire Disaster Funding Act has been introduced in both the House
(H.R. 2862) and the Senate (S. 1842).]{.underline} This [bipartisan
bill]{.underline} focuses on providing an emergency funding stream for
wildfires in an attempt to decrease fire borrowing. It would enable the
USFS to fund wildfire fighting costs in a similar manner to other
natural disasters, such as hurricanes, once the annual wildfire
suppression budget is exceeded. This would prevent money initially
intended for other programs from being used for fire suppression.

alf

Just after the Senate overcame objections in both parties to approve the
\$9 billion spending-cut bill requested by Trump, a comment from White
House budget director Russell Vought dropped like a bomb on Capitol
Hill.

"[The appropriations process has to be less bipartisan," Vought told
reporters]{.underline} at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast
Thursday. "It's not going to keep me up at night, and I think will lead
to better results, by having the appropriations process be a little bit
partisan."

He added that more rescission packages would be coming.

The [backlash was **fierce**. Senate Republicans responsible for
crafting the government funding bills were taken aback]{.underline} by
his candor.

"Mr. Vought's lack of respect and apparent lack of understanding of how
Congress operates is baffling, because he's served in government
before," Collins told NBC News.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said Vought "disrespects" the
appropriations process in Congress with his "dismissive" comments.

"I think he thinks that we are irrelevant," she said.

And Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Thursday called on
Trump to "fire Russell Vought immediately, before he destroys our
democracy and runs the country into the ground."

The [series of clashes **escalates tensions**]{.underline} leading up to
the fall deadline, with [top Democrats warning ahead of the vote that
they would have **little incentive** to provide the 60 votes to cut a
deal.]{.underline}

"It is [absurd to expect Democrats to play along]{.underline} with
funding the government [if Republicans are just]{.underline} going to
renege on a bipartisan agreement by [concocting rescissions packages
behind closed doors]{.underline} that can pass with only their votes,"
[Schumer warned in a recent speech.]{.underline}

The debate over the demise of individual lawmakers getting to dictate
where federal funding is allocated came to a head during a recent
meeting of the Senate Appropriations Committee, with many senators
arguing that the work they were doing in that moment may just be
overridden by congressional leadership and the president.

"The one thing we all agree on is [the appropriations process is
**broken**]{.underline}," former Senate Republican Leader Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky., lamented, describing how during his 18 years leading
the GOP conference he helped oversee a shift away from government
funding levels being decided by committees and instead being negotiated
by only the highest levels of leadership and the White House.

"I concluded our failure to pass our bills empower every president,
regardless of party, because I've been in those discussions at the end,
the big four and the guy with the pen, and that makes all of our
requests irrelevant," McConnell said.

Collins has repeatedly blamed the decline of the process on Schumer's
refusal to put appropriations bills on the Senate floor. That has also
been a slow-moving trend: McConnell and former Majority Leader Harry
Reid, D-Nev., also short-circuited the process on the floor when in
charge.

Rising [partisanship has weakened committees broadly]{.underline} and
placed more power in the hands of leadership. In the context of
government funding, that led to "omnibus" spending bills and continuing
resolutions --- or CRs --- negotiated by party leaders and jammed
through Congress, often with an impending deadline to pressure holdouts
to fall in line quickly.

But House Republicans raised hell, torching the massive bills negotiated
behind closed doors as a betrayal to their constituents. In recent
years, they have successfully steered their leadership away from that
approach. And it [**leaves few options going forward**.]{.underline}

\'What the math tells us\'

Durbin, who is retiring after a 30-year Senate career, reminisced about
when the process was at the peak of its powers --- last century. The
last time Congress completed it through "regular order" was in the
1990s.

"There was a time when we called 12 appropriation bills to the floor,
open for amendment! Can you imagine that?" Durbin said. "I remember. And
you had to do your job in the committee. You had to have a subcommittee
lined up on a bipartisan basis, a full committee lined up on a
bipartisan basis. And the committee stood together. And you could find
enough to support it to pass something. That, I think, really reflected
the best of the Senate."

He attributed the change to the growing discord between the parties and
the declining "reputation of the Appropriations Committee," although he
credited Collins and Vice Chair Patty Murray, D-Wash., with trying to
restore the bipartisan spirit of the panel.

Collins, notably, is on an island as the only GOP senator who voted
against both attempts to rewrite government funding --- in the megabill
and rescissions package. Collins is also up for re-election next year in
a Democratic-leaning state that Trump lost in 2024.

Sarah Binder, a political scientist at George Washington University and
the Brookings Institution, said [the megabill's changes to GOP spending
priorities "**undermines** the rough parity between defense and
nondefense discretionary spending that until recently made **bipartisan
deals** possible."]{.underline}

She added, "The Trump OMB's aggressive impoundments of enacted
appropriations severely threatens Congress' power of the purse and with
it the authority and expertise of and oversight by appropriators."

Yet even as Republicans find new ways to go around the Senate's 60-vote
threshold, [Thune has promised he won't abolish the
filibuster.]{.underline} He distanced himself from Vought's remarks.

"Well, that runs contrary to what the math tells us around here," he
said. "So, we need 60 on approps bills. And it's going to take 60 to
fund the government."

[The **path to a new funding law is murky, at best.**]{.underline}

Federal cybersecurity work is also unique. \"Government databases are

Convention on Civil Liability for Damage from Marine Pollution by Oil
(1969), the London Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by
Dumping of Waste and Other Materials (1972), the Declaration of the UN
Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment (1972), the Convention on
Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (1979), UN Convention on the Law
of the Sea (1982), Convention on the Prevention of Pollution from Ships
(1973), International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Control
and Cooperation (1990), UN Framework Convention on Climate Change
(1992), Kyoto Protocol 1997, The 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate
Change, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development (1992) and a
number of others.20) In 1996, the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of the
countries of the Arctic region signed the Ottawa Declaration and formed
the Arctic Council, which is designed, among other things, to provide a
program for the comprehensive implementation of sustainable development.
The Arctic Council is a key institution for **[international
environmental cooperation in the Arctic]{.underline}**. The main goals
and objectives of the Arctic Council are: conducting environmental
monitoring, obtaining reliable and sufficient information about the
state of the Arctic environment; developing proposals and
recommendations for the prevention and control of pollution for the
Arctic States and observer countries.21) The work of the Arctic Council
is carried out within the framework of six working groups on various
environmental aspects:Elimination of Arctic Pollution
(ACAP).Implementation of the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program
(AMAP).Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF).Prevention,
preparedness and Response to emergencies (EPPR).Protection of the Arctic
Marine environment (PAME). Sustainable development in the Arctic
(SDWG).Thus, **[[Russia and the United States cooperated both]{.mark}
within the framework of the development of norms of international
environmental law [for the preservation of the fragile ecosystem of
the]{.mark} [Arctic]{.mark}, and directly "in the field", participating
in working groups.]{.underline}** The analysis of the approaches that
are integrated into the policy of the United States and Russia in the
Arctic suggests that the countries have many common interests in the
region. **[Russia and the United States have no open or potentially
significant conflicts on the climate problem in the
Arctic]{.underline}**. Guided by the principles of international law,
participating in a number of international organizations (the Arctic
Council, the International Maritime Organization), the countries have
made attempts to develop a constructive multilateral and bilateral
dialogue. **[Speaking about the unifying factors, it should be noted
that [both countries declared their commitment to the concept of
sustainable development for the preservation of the Arctic
environment]{.mark}, monitoring climate change and solving problems
arising in this area]{.underline}**, realizing the great importance of
the Arctic as a determining factor from the point of view of the global
ecosystem. Russia and the United States understand the need to preserve
the biological diversity and ecosystems of the Arctic, which are
experiencing stress as a result of increased human activity. Mitigation
of risk factors related to environmental and human safety is becoming
increasingly important in the implementation of the policies of both
countries in the Arctic. Both Russia and the United States emphasized
the importance of science for understanding the specifics of the Arctic
and ensuring the implementation of sustainable development. Thus,
cooperation began to be built, first of all, under the auspices of the
Arctic Council, in which there are many working groups aimed, in
particular, at solving socio-economic problems in the Arctic. However,
2022 was a turning point in the activities of the Arctic Council and
international cooperation in the Arctic. Shortly after the events of
February 2022, seven member countries of the Arctic Council (Denmark,
Iceland, Canada, Norway, USA, Finland, Sweden) announced the suspension
of their participation in all official events of the Arctic Council and
its subsidiary bodies in connection with the situation around Ukraine,
as well as their refusal to send representatives to Council meetings
held in Russia.22) The Arctic Economic Council did not suspend its
activities involving Russia; however, it scrapped plans to hold the
upcoming annual meeting in a mixed format in St. Petersburg, opting
instead to hold the event online. The turning point came during the
Russian chairmanship of the Arctic Council, which will last until 2023.
Nikolai Korchunov, Ambassador-at-Large of the Russian Ministry of
Foreign Affairs in the AC, noted that the decision of the Arctic Council
members will lead to an increase in the risks and challenges associated
with maintaining security in the region. In connection with the current
situation, the mechanisms of Russia's chairmanship in the Arctic Council
will be reoriented towards solving the national problems of the
development of northern territories.23) Most likely, a return to the
usual nature of interaction within the framework of the Arctic Council
should not be expected in the near future. There have been no further
official announcements about the format of the AC's work. In the short
term, at the expert level, the seven Western countries of the AC are
considering options for cooperation without Russia.From 2014 until
recently, **[[the Arctic remained the region least affected by the
crisis --- in cooperation between Russia and the
West]{.mark},]{.underline}** it even continued, despite many
difficulties. At the same time, the Arctic Council (AC) played the role
of the most authoritative intergovernmental forum for the development of
cooperation in the Arctic and was considered one of the few remaining
non-politicized platforms for dialogue. The Arctic was often called the
territory of peace and dialogue, many Russian and Western analysts
included the Arctic among the areas where ties between Russia and
Western countries are possible and promising, despite the general crisis
in relations between Russia and the West. However nowadays, the future
of cooperation in the Arctic, in particular within the framework of the
Sustainable Development Goals, remains uncertain. At the same time, it
is obvious that in order to solve many problems of the Arctic region in
the field of ecology, economy, culture, health, emergency prevention,
protection of the interests of the Indigenous peoples of the North, it
is necessary to implement a multilateral approach. At the same time,
given the current international conjuncture, it is difficult to say
about the immediate prospects for cooperation between the United States
and the Russian Federation in the Arctic, as evidenced by the continued
interaction in the region on problematic issues without Russia's
participation, as well as Russia's rapprochement with China, which has
extensively increased participation in Arctic affairs. Thus, at present,
cooperation in the Arctic region in the long term is seen as fragmented.
Nevertheless, we believe and hope that the members of the Arctic
Council, Russia and the USA especially, will find a way to collaborate
under the banner of sustainable development in order to make the Arctic
a zone of peace.

#### Arctic wildfires present an existential threat to indigenous communities

**Kirchner 25** \[Stefan Kirchner, \"Connected Disaster Risks: Wildfires
and Climate Change in the Arctic\", ND, No Publication,

There are clear human and social dimensions to Arctic wildfires.
"Wildland fires are a critical environmental concern with far-reaching
ecological, social, cultural and economic implications."\[28\] Wildfires
contribute to air pollution in the Arctic.\[29\] This, in turn, affects
human health. Arctic wildfires are a global problem, too, because of the
global health effects from wildfires: "Every year, there are an
estimated 340,000 premature deaths from respiratory and cardiovascular
issues attributed to wildfire smoke".\[30\] Wildfires also lead to
displacement and to the loss of homes.\[31\] **[Indigenous communities
are particularly at risk from wildfires because of their particular
dependence on an intact natural environment]{.underline}**:\[32\]
"[Arctic wildfires can hit Indigenous Peoples' lands particularly hard,
destroying food and water sources and disrupting their livelihoods and
culture practices".\[33\] Indigenous communities might also be at a
higher-than-average risk of adverse effects of wildfires because they
might be overlooked by policies that focus on population-dense areas or
that might be based on lack of information or even colonial stereotypes.
This elevated risk for marginalized groups is a problem the Arctic
shares with other parts of the world.\[34\] The same is true for the
long-term effects as "\[t\]he effects of wildfires linger long after the
flames die down, hitting public health and wellbeing far into the
future".\[35\]]{.underline}

#### Thawing permafrost uniquely affects Native communities, and only the usfg can help

Nina **Kravinsky**, NPR, "Thawing permafrost threatens Alaska\'s rural
villages. And time is running out," April 3, **2024**,
https://www.npr.org/2024/04/03/1242451927/permafrost-underlying-many-remote-villages-in-alaska-is-thawing-and-thats-a-prob

Wilson Twitchell\'s house is sinking. Twitchell and his wife, Bertha,
are raising seven children in their small home in Kasigluk, a Yup\'ik
village of about 450 people in Southwest Alaska. These days, the little
wooden house looks a bit like a giant picked it up and tossed it
haphazardly back onto the tundra. One side is so sunken into the wet,
marshy ground that when neighbors walk past the kitchen window, all the
Twitchells can see are their knees. \"We try to jack up the house, but
there\'s no solid,\" Twitchell said, sitting in his cozy kitchen, where
supplies hang from the rafters and a pumpkin roll bakes in the oven.
\"Everything is turning into mush.\" Even as it sinks, Twitchell loves
this house. It\'s where he grew up. And he loves this village. Kasigluk
sits in the heart of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, a vast mosaic of lakes
and rivers that spreads across the tundra and nurtures the food that is
central to life in the village: salmon, whitefish, moose, and wild
berries. Bertha Twitchell tends to salmon drying at her family\'s fish
camp near Kasigluk. The Twitchells are Yup\'ik, and maintaining their
subsistence lifestyle is imperative as they consider where they might
move. In the nearby town of Bethel, \"it\'s still easy to go out and
just go fishing and hunting,\" Wilson said. \"In Anchorage, you have to
drive miles and miles before you get to do that.\" *Katie Basile for
NPR* But the Twitchells aren\'t sure how much longer this house will be
standing. Beneath the village, [a layer of permafrost, once frozen
year-round, has begun to thaw]{.underline}. Formerly solid ground has
turned swampy. [The local [river is eroding its banks and encroaching on
nearby homes. \"It\'s a losing battle,\"]{.mark}]{.underline} Wilson
Twitchell said. \"You can definitely see that the water is rising, the
land is getting smaller.\" Soon his family will have to move. And it\'s
not clear where they will go. Like the Twitchells, [families in Alaska
[Native communities]{.mark} across the state [are in a race against
time]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Human-caused [[climate change is
warming the region]{.mark} and thawing the frozen mixture of ice, rock
and dirt that underlies much of the landscape. That\'s [undermining
everything from homes and schools to water and sanitation
systems.]{.mark} Alaska [Native communities]{.mark} have been raising
the alarm for years, [warn]{.mark}ing [that thawing permafrost and
erosion threaten their ability to stay on the land where their families
have lived for generations.]{.mark} Now, officials say, [the issue has
reached a breaking point]{.mark}. \"We are experiencing [widespread
permafrost thaw]{.mark}, and that [impacts buildings, roads, pipelines,
the landscapes and Indigenous ways of life,]{.mark}\" said Jocelyn
Fenton, director of programs with the Denali Commission, a federal
agency responsible for some Alaska infrastructure. \"[It is a critical
issue that is here now.\"]{.mark}]{.underline} Wilson, Bertha and their
daughter Angela in the kitchen at their home in Kasigluk, Alaska. This
year, for the first time, Wilson and Bertha said they can sometimes hear
water hitting the outside corner of the house. Erosion, permafrost thaw
and flooding have eaten away at the land and caused the foundation of
the home to sink. *Katie Basile for NPR* A call for a new approach Local
officials and advocates say [[the federal government isn\'t doing enough
to help, and it\'s time for a new approach]{.underline}.]{.mark} [A new
report](https://www.anthc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Unmet_Needs_Report_22JAN24.pdf)
from a major nonprofit and [[the state of Alaska calls for an overhaul
in how the federal government helps tribal
communities]{.underline}]{.mark} that need to relocate some or all of
their members because of climate change. [[Funding to assist Alaska
Native villages dealing with climate impacts has increased in recent
years. But it\'s still far from enough]{.underline}]{.mark} --- and the
funding mechanisms can be too fragmented for small communities to
access, said Jackie Qataliña Schaeffer, director of climate initiatives
at the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, which released the
report. The report estimates Alaska villages will need \$80 million more
per year over the next decade to keep their residents, like the
Twitchells, safe. The cemetery in Akiuk is no longer safe to walk in or
maintain due to sinkholes and unstable ground. The community now lays
its members to rest in a new cemetery in Akula (right). Soon, the living
will need to move across the river, too. *Katie Basile for NPR* To get
help, villages often have to apply for separate federal programs to fund
housing, roads, or sanitation. They end up competing with each other for
the same funding opportunities. And in small communities, limited
staffing makes it challenging to apply to a laundry list of federal
grants. \"There\'s so many moving parts to these projects that it\'s
overwhelming,\" Schaeffer said. \"Then you add those layers and
barriers, and it really, in some cases, is simply impossible.\" Susanna
Isaac stands on an old dock in Akiuk, which connects to the community\'s
boardwalks. \"We can\'t even walk off them or we will sink. It\'s too
swampy,\" she said. It wasn\'t like that when she was growing up.
\"There used to be a path of mud, hard mud, and we\'d walk back and
forth to houses,\" Isaac said, sketching memories of how the land has
changed over time in Kasigluk. Katie Basile for NPR Rather than
disparate pools of funds at separate agencies, the report calls on the
federal government to create a unified pot of money --- overseen by just
one agency. \"The funding process just doesn\'t fit rural Alaska,\"
Schaeffer said. A White House spokesperson told NPR the Biden
administration is reviewing the report and its recommendations. In 2022,
the administration launched a new effort to help tribal communities
threatened by climate change to plan relocation efforts. Several Alaska
communities have received funding through that and other programs, much
of it made available through recent legislation passed by Congress,
including the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the 2022 Inflation
Reduction Act. But dozens of other villages, including Kasigluk,
haven\'t received such funding. A tundra island near Kasigluk erodes,
exposing thawing permafrost. Two months after this photo was taken, the
opening collapsed completely. Katie Basile for NPR Crossing the river
The simplest solution for the Twitchell family would be to move across
the river. The Johnson River runs through Kasigluk, dividing it into
two, even smaller, villages. The Twitchells live on one side of the
river, called Akiuk. Across the river is Akula, home to the tribal
office and a tiny airstrip. The deteriorating permafrost isn\'t evenly
distributed beneath the landscape, which means some areas, like Akiuk,
are thawing faster. Akula remains more stable --- at least for now.
Nearly everyone in Kasigluk agrees that the best solution is for the
families on the Akiuk side to move across the river to Akula. The
question is how to pay for it --- especially in a village, and region,
where much of the community lives below the poverty line. Tribal
administrator Nickefer Kassel and the traditional council have spent
years working on a way to get residents to the safer side of the river.
But they\'re constantly struggling with the complicated process, he
said, running up against a lack of funds and tangles with red tape.
\"It\'s pretty stressing,\" Kassel said. \"At times it feels like
everything is in a stall. It\'s frustrating.\" Left: Old Kasigluk, or
Akiuk, as seen from the air. Community members are losing land in Akiuk
and hope to relocate across the river to new Kasigluk, or Akula. Right:
Nickefer Kassel, Kasigluk Tribal Administrator. Katie Basile for NPR For
most people, moving across the river would mean building a new house.
Like much of rural Alaska, Kasigluk has a severe housing shortage, and
most of the threatened homes have deteriorated too much to relocate. But
building in rural Alaska is extremely expensive. There are no roads
connecting Kasigluk to the nearest town. The community relies on planes
and snowmobiles to travel across the tundra in winter, or boats in
summer. Most supplies and construction crews have to come by plane or
barge. Villages like Kasigluk can try to piece together money from
federal grants, but advocates say there isn\'t enough available. The
money that does exist is tricky for local officials to find and apply
for --- especially for a small village without a planning department.
\"It\'s hard for even the \[federal\] agencies to know exactly what
funding is out there,\" Fenton said. Agnes Berlin at home on the Akiuk
side of Kasigluk, Oct. 18, 2023. Berlin, who is in her late 70s, said
she dreamed once there were orange and apple trees growing on the
tundra. It\'s something her elders told her would happen one day --- as
people strayed from tradition, the winters would warm. Katie Basile for
NPR This isn\'t a new issue in Alaska. More than two decades ago, in a
2003 report, the U.S. Government Accountability Office warned that the
majority of Alaska Native villages were affected by flooding and
erosion. But very few qualified for federal aid to deal with those
issues, the report said. How the federal government navigates this issue
in Alaska could inform how it helps tribes and other communities
confronting similar issues in the rest of the country, Fenton and
Schaeffer said. Communities in Washington state, Louisiana and South
Carolina are already coping with rising sea levels. \"We could learn a
lot from these small communities when we\'re looking at sea level rise
and other issues in the Lower 48 states,\" Fenton said. \'That part of
it I would miss\' In Kasigluk, residents say they want to stay as close
as possible to where they live now. Access to the land is central to the
thriving Yup\'ik language and culture that surrounds everything here. At
the Akiuk school, which is also at risk from deteriorating permafrost, a
teacher beats a drum as children of all ages practice a traditional form
of dance, or yuraq. This kind of dancing was discouraged, and even
sometimes banned, by missionaries in this area in the early 20th
century. But now, students wave their arms and chant the Yup\'ik words
fluently. The dance is part of the culture Wilson Twitchell says he and
his family would risk losing if he is forced to leave Kasigluk. But he
may not have a choice, if the water overtakes his home before the
village can build more housing across the river. Twitchell says he would
most likely move to Bethel, the closest city, or even to Anchorage, 400
miles away. Moving would come at a cost --- and not just a financial
one. Hunting and fishing on this land are a central part of Yup\'ik
culture, he says. \"What I would be leaving is the freedom to be inside
the house, and in five minutes you\'re already out in the wilderness,\"
Twitchell said. He pointed to his family\'s boat, just a few steps away.
\"You step out and you take off,\" he said. \"That part of it I would
miss.\"

#### Wildfires and permafrost collapse results in [lost heritage]{.underline}.

**Trent 21** \[Steve Trent, chief executive of the Environmental Justice
Foundation, more than 30 years\' experience in environmental and human
rights campaigning; "'Nature has crease to trust us'," The Ecologist,
8/5/21;
https://theecologist.org/2021/aug/05/nature-has-ceased-trust-us\]

Carbon-rich

[[Permafrost collapse is]{.mark} already [happening at a worrying
speed]{.mark}, and [Arctic communities]{.mark} and wildlife alike
[are]{.mark} now [under **serious threat**]{.mark} as a direct
result.]{.underline}

Some 2.5 million square miles of permafrost --- 40 percent of the
world's total --- could still disappear by the end of the century even
if we manage stabilise the climate at 2°C above pre-industrial levels.
Currently, we are on a pathway to 3°C of heating.

"There was always erosion of the river banks, but ... it took only 30-50
centimetres, about half a metre in total each year. There were years
when it took a metre. Now, in some places, depending on the thawing of
the permafrost, sometimes it can go under 10 metres of the coast," said
Viacheslav.

This is forcing Indigenous settlements to move, and then move again, to
escape the encroaching riverbank.

[Worse still, it is clear that permafrost collapse does not happen in
isolation, [it is a '**tipping point'**, leading to **ecosystem
destruction**, infrastructure **damage**, and]{.mark} enough [CO2 and
methane]{.mark} release from the carbon-rich soil [to heat]{.mark} our
[world at a **terrifying rate**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Wildfire

"Right now, our civilisation emits about 10 billion tons of carbon in
the form of CO2 and methane. [[\[**Thawing\] permafrost** will
add]{.mark} at least another **[2 billion tones]{.mark}**]{.underline},"
said [Nikita Zimov, environmental scientist and director of the
Pleistocene Park in northern Siberia.]{.underline}

"I would be very surprised if permafrost is still intact 30 years from
now," continued Nikita.

[The impacts of climate breakdown forced upon the Arctic Indigenous
peoples are **increasing** each year. In a stark symbol of how the
crisis has deepened, **this [land of ice is]{.mark} increasingly [on
fire.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[[During]{.mark} the [2020]{.mark} wildfire season, around
**[600]{.mark}** individual [**fire hotspots** were detected **every
day** in the Arctic]{.mark} Circle -- [up to **three times higher**
than]{.mark} the average for [2019]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[These [fires]{.mark} covered 3**.6 million km2 with smoke** and
[released roughly **205 megatonnes** of CO2]{.mark} -- [more
than]{.mark} the **annual output** of [Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and
Finland combined.]{.mark}]{.underline}

\[\[IMAGE OMITTED\]\]

Culture

[[Melting permafrost and wildfires]{.underline}]{.mark}, coupled with
planned increased industrialisation of the Arctic by Russia, [[is
creating a **spiral of destruction**]{.mark} that is pulling Indigenous
communities down with it.]{.underline}

There are [roughly half a million Indigenous people living in the
arctic, belonging to over 40 different ethnic groups.]{.underline}

[These [rare, **irreplaceable** cultures]{.mark} have persisted for
thousands of years in some of the most extreme conditions on Earth but
[are]{.mark} now [**threatened** by]{.mark} climate [breakdown]{.mark}.
For these people, [**the** degradation of their **environment and** the
erosion of their **culture go hand in hand**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"\[Reindeer\] are my life. It's as simple as that. I live for the
reindeer and they mean everything to me. To be in the nature, with the
animals \[...\] I don't need anything else. I am Sami, it's me. And I'm
proud of it," says Kenneth Pittja, a Sami reindeer herder in Sweden.

"[Only in our **traditional occupations**]{.underline}, only in reindeer
husbandry, in hunting, in fishing, [we can **preserve** our language,
our way of life, our **culture**", added Viacheslav.]{.underline}

\[\[IMAGE OMITTED\]\]

Identity

[Climate breakdown is forcing more and more young families, searching
for security for themselves and their children, to move to the cities.
"If they think about the future of their children, they leave,"
explained Viachesc lav.]{.underline}

[They do not see a future for themselves in the villages, but [the more
people move, the more Indigenous language]{.mark}s are forgotten, [and
heritage lost.]{.mark}]{.underline}

["These changes, which complicate our activities, our way of life,
ultimately affect the basis of the existence of the people themselves.
Globalization has reached everywhere.]{.underline}

\"But in the conditions of the village \[rather than a city\] there is
more opportunity to preserve some kind of identity," said Viacheslav.

#### Permafrost thaw harms traditional knowledge and culture.

3.2.4 Cultural continuity and knowledge transfer: Observed and
anticipated impacts

[[Permafrost thaw]{.mark} has the potential to [impact many different
aspects of Indigenous culture, including]{.mark}]{.underline} (but not
limited to) [**[harvesting]{.mark}** and access to the land;
**[knowledge transmission]{.mark}**; ceremonies; [and other
patterns]{.mark} of land use and occupancy central [to the **cultural
life** of]{.mark} **Northern Indigenous
[communities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Literature to date has primarily
focused on the impacts to harvesting and access to the land.

[Traditional harvesting is **critical** to the provision of food and the
subsistence of communities, but it is also an important part of culture.
Permafrost thaw is impacting harvesting and will continue to impact it
by creating shifts and reductions in game populations, potential impacts
to the health of country foods, **reduced safety** while travelling, and
**increased costs** associated with harvesting.]{.underline}

Climate changes are making access to the land and traditional hunting
grounds more difficult for Northern Indigenous communities year-round.
While winter access along the coast becomes more difficult due to the
changes to the sea-ice platform, summer access is being profoundly
changed by permafrost thaw. Landslides and trail erosion make travelling
on land dangerous in the summer and can cause ATVs to get stuck (Calmels
et al. 2015). [Permafrost thaw can make travel **hazardous**, creating
new wetlands and damaging traditional hunting trails. As a result,
harvesters may be forced to **shift locations** or even **abandon**
traditional **hunting grounds** altogether.]{.underline}

[[Spending time on the land was emphasized]{.mark} by all participants
[as]{.mark} being [**central** to their]{.mark} identities and central
to maintaining **[cultural identity]{.mark}** by teaching **future
generations**. Perhaps [the **most significant threat**]{.mark} posed by
permafrost thaw to cultural continuity [is the reduced ability of
community members to spend time on]{.mark} the [land]{.mark} in the
company of family members or other knowledge holders in order [to learn
by immersion]{.mark} and by doing.]{.underline}

Important gathering places such as ceremonial areas, campgrounds, and
even village areas can be made inaccessible or destroyed by slump thaws.
[Preserved cultural remains such as sod homes and other artifacts are
**decaying faster now** and can be exposed to **thaw slumps** (Forbes et
al. 2015). Erosion of the land and changes to landforms may impact how
these sites are used as place-markers in story and in
memory.]{.underline}

Selected Quotes

[The quotes below outline participants' experiences and observations of
how]{.underline} climate changes, including [permafrost thaw, impact on
cultural continuity and knowledge transfer activities, as well as
anticipated changes or impacts that they are concerned may occur in the
future.]{.underline}

[Participants described the importance of their connection to the land
and how this was central to their cultural identity, and the importance
of passing this connection on to the next generation:]{.underline}

I was born ... east of Peawanuck. I was born in what they call a
trapline, but we don't consider that a trap area---it's our homeland....
I was the last of my family to be born on our homeland.... And it's
really important for me because it has been our way of life and living
with seasons. I think out on the land ... and the land is really
important to me. And because of the way we follow the seasons, it's ...
an important way of life for us, with our people of Peawanuck. (C02,
September 28, 2021)

[\[[Being on the land]{.mark},\] it's who we are. It **[connects us to
our past]{.mark}**. It connects us to my grandfather who's no longer
here---or my dad.... They **passed down their knowledge** to me and I
try to pass it on ... whether it's wisdom or habit---you know, the way I
set traps, the way I set snares, the way I fish, the way I
hunt]{.underline}. (C07, October 15, 2021)

Time spent on the land is important to learning about culture and land
use and adapting to change:

But the changes will affect us big-time in the future, especially the
young generation. And the only way is that we want to keep our
traditional way of life strong, but in a way the climate change is going
to keep happening and we have to send our kids to school and get good
education so we can fit in the future in the world, right? Education is
going to be the only way of life in the future. [I see nowadays the
[young generation]{.mark}, they're [taught about a traditional way of
life, but]{.mark} they can't, they're not going to be a hundred per cent
Dene way of living.... **[Everything's changing]{.mark}**. (C08, October
19, 2021)]{.underline}

[It's just things you do when you've learned to adapt and you've learned
to do things with your hands, and read the land, and read the waters,
and read the weather. So, that's one thing is the passing of that
knowledge, you know, **the transfer of knowledge**: building that
capacity, we'll say, with our youth that I gained from my uncles and
father when I was, you know, young.... And that's something [I fear
that]{.mark}, you know, all this change in climate, [permafrost
changes]{.mark}, you know, it's **[tak]{.mark}ing [away who we
are]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} and we're not going to pass it on.]{.underline}
(C07, October 15, 2021)

Participants describe oral history and stories of change and the
importance of adapting to change:

My grandparents told stories about the land. There used to be certain
things that are no longer there.... These are the changes, and we have
to adapt to it. So, if you know what is happening, it's not strange to
see the land changing, continuous changing. It may be fast. This decade
it have been very, very fast. (C03, September 28, 2021)

I think it's \[future conditions on the land\] be more water, standing
water, and softer ground, yeah. \... I really don't know \[how that will

Ford and others explain that [Indigenous people have **strong cultural**
and **spiritual ties to their lands** and "also have a central role in
detecting and managing change due to \[those\] deep connections to the
land and seas]{.underline}" (Ford, 2020). [[As]{.mark} industrialization
and social and [climate change **erase Arctic ice**]{.mark} and change
weather patterns, the foundational continuity for indigenous traditions,
[livelihoods and culture are **threatened**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Arctic
Centre, University of Lapland). This is [leaving the Arctic's native
people more **vulnerable** than ever, impacting their housing,
infrastructure, and transport connections to the point of necessary
relocation]{.underline} (Arctic Centre, University of Lapland). One
example from the National Snow and Ice Data Center shows that slower
fall freezes are leaving Indigenous peoples without access to hunting,
other communities, and health care (2020). "[As a result, the
livelihoods connected with hunting, fishing, and herding are under
threat. Indigenous peoples have an especially strong bond with nature
and the changes in harvesting activities may have implications for the
economy, society, culture and healt]{.underline}h" (Arctic Centre,
University of Lapland).

Relative to these people's ancestral lineage on this land, the impacts
they are seeing now from climate change are very disruptive to what they
have always known. [We know that [disruption causes]{.mark} mental
health challenges and suicidal risk factors like **[family
collapse]{.mark}**, increased **[alcoholism]{.mark}**, and **child
[abuse and neglect]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Hersher, 2016). One example
of widespread community devastation and rapidly forced adaptation
happened in New Orleans, Louisiana following Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
[[A study found]{.underline}]{.mark} that serious to moderate mental
illness nearly doubled among survivors of one of the deadliest
hurricanes on record, forcing 500,000 people to relocate from their
homes (Kessler, 2006). [Another example of [how climate change]{.mark}
is [devastat]{.mark}ing [homelands]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} by extension
the [mental health]{.mark} of its residents, comes from a 2016 wildfire
at Fort McMurray in Alberta, Canada]{.underline} (AMAP, 2021).
[[A]{.mark} mental health status [assessment of]{.mark} young

**p**]{.mark}**ost-[t]{.mark}raumatic [s]{.mark}tress
[d]{.mark}isorder**]{.underline} (AMAP, 2021).

While change in the Arctic has been more gradual than a single natural
disaster event, [considering mental health and psychological theory
shows how this [disruption of ecosystems]{.mark} and livelihoods can
[adversely affect mental health]{.mark}. Psychologist Urie
Bronfenbrenner developed an ecological paradigm that shows how a
person's development, interpersonal relationships, and overall
well-being are influenced by the **interconnected relationship** between
various ecosystems, from an **individual** to a **macro** level, and
vice-versa]{.underline} (Guy-Evans, 2020). The work of Bronfenbrenner
illustrates how interconnected human beings are with their environments
and cultures. [[This is especially true for Arctic]{.mark} Indigenous
[people.]{.mark} Livelihoods, [cultures, and support systems]{.mark},
all of which are under threat in the Arctic Indigenous communities,
[play an important role in **identity**]{.mark} **formation**, **life

[When]{.mark} people's [ecosystems are threatened]{.mark} or out of
balance and interpersonal relationships are strained, mental, physical,
and spiritual vitality wane. [That can be a catalyst for **isolation**
and **mental illness**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Mental health literature also demonstrates what can happen when basic
needs become more challenging to meet as a result of disrupted
ecological systems. One of psychology's most influential theorists,
Abraham Maslow, asserts that human needs exist in a hierarchical schema
where low level basic needs like food, water, shelter, safety, and
security must be accomplished before higher level, self-fulfillment
needs like a sense of belonging, fulfilling one's full potential, and
creative innovation can be satisfied (McLeod, 2014). If the lower-level
basic needs go unmet, or are disrupted, it creates a substantial impact
on a person's mental health.

Some of the higher-level needs for the Arctic Indigenous, in particular,
are currently under threat and often overlooked in health care systems.
[According to the Arctic Human Development Report, Arctic Indigenous
people emphasize the importance of three key factors of human
development not found in the Human Development Index. These include
**fate control**]{.underline} (controlling one's own destiny),
[maintaining **cultural identity**, and **living close to
nature**]{.underline} (Larsen et al., 2014). Unfortunately, [large gaps
still exist for the Arctic Indigenous populations when it comes to
meeting their lower-level, basic survival needs making it that much more
difficult for them to realize these higher-level needs they hold as
sacred and necessary for well-being.]{.underline}

The unsustainable burden climate change puts on the Arctic Indigenous
people is playing out most uniquely for the future generations. These
[future [generations are]{.mark} being [raised by parents who
have]{.mark} long [been coping with ecological disruptions and unmet
needs]{.mark}. Now, [these parents are suffering with mental illnesses
such as **substance abuse** and **depression** as a result of
**traumatic assimilation**]{.mark} demands [and]{.mark} **rapid
[modernization]{.mark}**[. This increases mental health risk factors for
their children]{.mark}]{.underline} (Barrett, 2019). As these parents
are then looked upon to manage the burden of past and present
circumstances, [they are also managing the path forward for their
children. [This]{.mark} begins to [illustrate what]{.mark} can [happen

**substantially [eradicated]{.mark}** [within]{.mark} the span of **[a

caught somewhere between a **demand for modernity** and new ways of
living and a **sacred duty** to honor the culture of their ancestors as
they find a way forward amid the far-reaching impacts of climate

Average warming of the climate system over the past five decades has
been widely attributed to greenhouse gas emissions---primarily carbon
dioxide (CO~2~)---from the burning of fossil fuels. This belief has led
to calls for greatly reducing humanity's reliance on such fuels and a
transition to "renewable" energy sources such as wind power and solar
energy.

For the purposes of guiding public policy and for adaptation to any
climate change that occurs, it is necessary to understand the claims of
global warming science as promoted by the United Nations
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).1

[While the climate system has warmed somewhat over the past five
decades, [the]{.mark} popular [perception of a "climate crisis"
and]{.mark} resulting [calls for]{.mark} economically [significant
regulation of]{.mark} CO2 [emissions is not supported by
science]{.mark}.]{.underline}

**What Causes Temperature Change?**

Before addressing how much warming has been observed, it is useful to
explain what causes the temperature of anything---the climate system,
the human body, a pot of water on the stove, a car's engine---to change.
The underlying concepts are not difficult to grasp and are experienced
by people on a daily basis.

**Temperature Change Is Caused by an Imbalance Between Energy Gain and
Energy Loss.** One may picture an uncovered pot of water on a stove
being heated over a very low flame. The water will warm rather rapidly
when the stove is first turned on, then it will warm more slowly as the
warm pot loses energy to its cooler surroundings. At some point, the
water will stop warming altogether as the hot water loses energy to its
surroundings just as fast as the flame puts energy into the pot. This
state is called "energy balance" and it corresponds to a stable,
constant temperature.2

D. B. R. Kenning, "Heat Balance," AccessScience, last reviewed August
2020, https://www.accessscience.com/content/article/a310400 (accessed
January 3, 2024).

Or one may imagine wearing a coat outside in the winter. People wear
coats to reduce the rate of energy loss by their bodies. If people did
not wear coats, their bodies would lose energy faster than they could
generate heat through metabolism, and people would go into hypothermia.
The coat helps to maintain energy balance by reducing the rate of energy
loss by people's bodies.

As a final example, everyone has experienced how air temperature changes
on a sunny day. The air warms through the morning and early afternoon.
But by late afternoon, something curious happens: The temperature starts
going down, even though the sun is still shining. This cooling happens
because the rate of energy loss by the air becomes greater than the rate
of energy gain from sunlight as the sun sinks lower in the sky.

In all of these examples, when energy gain equals energy loss, there is
no temperature change. If there is an imbalance between rates of energy
gain and energy loss, the temperature changes.

**Recent Warming of the Climate System Corresponds to a Tiny Energy
Imbalance**

The average rate of energy gain by the global climate system from
sunlight is variously estimated to be 235 to 245 Watts per square meter
(W/m^2^),3

Kevin E. Trenberth, John T. Fasullo, and Jeffrey Kiehl, "Earth's Global
Energy Budget," Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, Vol.
90, No. 3 (2009), pp. 311--324,
https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/90/3/2008bams2634_1.xml
(accessed January 3, 2024).

so, for purposes of discussion the assumption is 240 W/m^2^. For global
temperatures to remain approximately constant over time, the rate of
energy loss by the system to outer space, which occurs through infrared
(IR) "heat" radiation, must also be approximately 240 W/m^2^.

But just how well do climate researchers know these numbers, and what is
the evidence that there is a natural balance between them? The best
satellite measurements from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's (NASA's) Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System's
(CERES's) instruments are only accurate to a few W/m^2^ (about 1 percent
of the average energy flows4

). [[To estimate the level of global energy imbalance, researchers
use]{.mark} long-term [measurements of the]{.mark} gradual [warming of

[From the]{.mark} observed [rates of warming]{.mark} of the deep ocean
[it is straightforward to compute that the current energy imbalance is
only]{.mark} about 0.6 W/m2,]{.underline}[5]{.underline}

[which is [a]{.mark} tiny [fraction of the approximate]{.mark} 240 W/m2

[considerably smaller (by]{.mark} about [a factor of four) than the
accuracy with which one can measure]{.mark} global average rates of
energy gain and loss in and out of [the climate system using
satellites.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[This is important because]{.mark} it means that [some portion of
recent warming could be natural]{.mark}. But since climate researchers
do not understand natural sources of climate change, such as those that
caused the Roman Warm Period of about 2,000 years ago, the Medieval Warm
Period of about 1,000 years ago, and the Little Ice Age several
centuries ago, most climate researchers simply assume that a similar
event is not happening today.]{.underline}[6]{.underline}

and Their Implications," Geology, Vol. 26, No. 5 (1998), pp. 471--473,

[Instead of admitting that natural processes could be at work in causing
climate change, "energy equilibrium" is what is assumed by the
mainstream climate research community for the natural state of climate
system unaffected by humans. The members of this community assume that
the rate of energy input into the climate system from the sun is, on
average, exactly equal to the rate of energy loss to outer space from IR
radiation when averaged globally and over many years.]{.underline} The
current, small roughly 0.6 W/m^2^ imbalance in the approximate 240
W/m^2^ energy flows in and out of the climate system is then entirely
blamed on the burning of fossil fuels.

But this energy balance assumption for the Earth is a statement of
faith, not science. As mentioned, a natural state of global energy
balance cannot be demonstrated. Even using NASA's best satellite
measurements of energy flows through the climate system.

**Climate Models Assume Energy Balance, but Have Difficulty Achieving
It**

The projections of climate change in the news, and that form the basis
of government efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, come from
computerized climate models run by climate research centers in various
countries.7

Veronika Eyring et al., "Overview of the Coupled Model Intercomparison
Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) Experimental Design and Organization,"
Geoscientific Model Development, Vol. 9 (2016), pp. 1937--1958,
https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/9/1937/2016/ (accessed January 3,
2023).

[[These projections]{.mark} are similar to weather forecast models but
[have]{.mark} additional [enhancements that are not needed]{.mark} in
short-term weather forecasts. The models are adjusted to produce no
long-term climate change. In other words, [the models assume that all
climate change is unnatural, and then are used as "proof" of
human-caused climate change when extra CO2 is added to them. Of course,
this is circular reasoning]{.mark}. [There are also numerous]{.mark}
potentially [natural]{.mark}, or non-CO2-related, [reasons a climate may
change]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The large number of climate models produce global warming rates which
vary by about a factor of three between them (1.8°C to 5.6°C)8

Gerald A. Meehl et al., "Context for Interpreting Equilibrium Climate
Sensitivity and Transient Climate Response from the CMIP6 Earth System
Models," Science, Vol. 6 (2020),

in response to a doubling of atmospheric CO~2~ (2 x CO~2~). In 2023,
Earth's atmosphere was about 50 percent of the way to 2 x CO~2~.
Amazingly, this factor-of-three range of warming projections has not
changed in the more than 30 years of climate-model improvements. This
proves that climate-model forecasts are not, as is often claimed, based
on proven physics. If they were, they would all produce about the same
amount of warming.

As described above, temperature change is the result of energy
imbalance, and all climate models have been tuned to produce energy
balance in the absence of human-produced CO~2~-equivalent emissions.9

Frédéric Hourdin et al., "The Art and Science of Climate Model Tuning,"
Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, Vol. 98, No. 3 (2017),
pp. 589--602,
https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/98/3/bams-d-15-00135.1.xml
(accessed January 3, 2023).

Without such tuning adjustments (one might call them "fudge factors,"
some of which are *ad hoc*), almost all models' temperature would slowly
drift over time---that is, become progressively warmer or cooler.
Despite this tuning, many models have been found to still have problems
conserving energy.10

Damien Irving et al., "A Mass and Energy Conservation Analysis of Drift
in the CMIP6 Ensemble," Journal of Climate, Vol. 34 (2021), pp.
3157--3170,
https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/34/8/JCLI-D-20-0281.1.xml
(accessed January 3, 2023).

Energy conservation (probably the most fundamental law in science, the
First Law of Thermodynamics) should be a necessary requirement of any
model used for energy policy decisions. The need for model tuning is
unavoidable because the fundamental physical processes in the climate
system (especially cloud characteristics) are not known accurately
enough to build a stable model from physical first principles alone. So,
empirical adjustments must be made to those modeled processes so that
the model will not spuriously warm or cool over centuries of model run
time. Yet, even at this, many models fail.

The assumption that the climate system is in a natural state of energy
balance also means that the models do not include any sources of
long-term natural climate change. Again, this assumption is rather
unavoidable since models can only include processes that climate
researchers understand and can quantify, and that knowledge does not
currently exist for natural sources of long-term climate change. While
scientists often assume that long-term changes must come from some
external forcing agent (such as increasing CO~2~ or a change in solar
activity), the Earth's climate is known to be a "nonlinear dynamical
system," exhibiting chaotic fluctuations, such that long-term changes
are possible without any external forcing.11

Dynamical System,"

For example, small-scale turbulence in the oceans has been shown to be
capable of producing substantial chaotic changes in ocean heat
content,12

a result that invariably is blamed on humanity's greenhouse gas
emissions.

As a result of the assumptions inherent in climate models, any claims
they "prove" that warming is due to human activity are clearly
disputable. There are no "fingerprints" of human-caused warming; for
example, warming caused by any process will be more rapid over land than
over oceans.13

While it is true that, based on theory, increasing CO~2~ levels in the
atmosphere should cause some warming, absent any other mitigating effect
from the presence of that CO~2~, just how much warming remains
uncertain. It is entirely possible that much of the warming that has
been observed (although over-predicted by the computer models) may
indeed be due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. After all,
greenhouse gasses, such as water vapor and CO~2~, absorb and emit IR
radiation,14

which is all that is needed for there to be an atmospheric greenhouse
effect (mostly due to water vapor) which keeps the Earth habitably warm
and helps to sustain life. But just how much warming will result from
humanity's role in all this remains considerably more uncertain than is
generally realized.

**[[The Direct Warming from a Doubling of CO2 Is Only
1.2°C]{.underline}]{.mark}**

How much warming does global warming theory say should occur from human
greenhouse gas emissions? The public has been led to believe that models
are fairly accurate in this regard, but the data show different results.
Global warming theory indicates that a doubling of atmospheric CO~2~
would cause only 1.2°C of direct warming if there are no other changes
in the climate system than temperature.15

The Climate Laboratory, 2022,

It is those other, indirect changes (called feedbacks) built into these
models that greatly amplify the rather benign 1.2°C of warming in almost
all climate models. These feedbacks lead to the wide range of current
model projections of 1.8°C to 5.6°C of warming in response to 2 x CO~2~.

are invariably the result of reliance on the models producing the most
warming, not on actual observations of the climate system which reveal
unremarkable changes over the past century or more.

**Climate Models Produce Too Much Warming**

[[Climate models]{.mark} are [not only used to predict]{.mark} future
[changes]{.mark} (forecasting), [but also]{.mark} to [explain past
changes]{.mark} (hindcasting). Depending on where temperatures are
measured (at the Earth's surface, in the deep atmosphere, or in the deep
ocean), [it is]{.mark} generally [true]{.mark} that climate [models have
a history of producing more warming than has been observed]{.mark} in
recent decades.]{.underline}[17]{.underline}

This disparity is not true of all the models, as two models (both
Russian) produce warming rates close to what has been observed, but
those models are not the ones used to promote the climate crisis
narrative. Instead, those producing the greatest amount of climate
change usually make their way into, for example, the U.S. National
Climate Assessment,18

U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit, "Impacts, Risks, and Adaptation in the

the congressionally mandated evaluation of what global climate models
project for climate in the United States.

The best demonstration of the tendency of climate models to overpredict
warming is a direct comparison between models and observations for
global average surface air temperature, shown in Chart 1.

In this plot, the average of five different observation-based datasets
(blue) are compared to the average of 36 climate models taking part in
the sixth IPCC Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The models
have produced, on average, 43 percent faster warming than has been
observed from 1979 to 2022. This is the period of the most rapid
increase in global temperatures and anthropogenic greenhouse gas
emissions, and also corresponds to the period for which satellite
observations exist (described below). This discrepancy between models
and observations is seldom mentioned despite that fact that it is,
roughly speaking, the average of the models (or even the most extreme
models) that is used to promote policy changes in the U.S. and abroad.

**Summertime Warming in the United States**

While global averages produce the most robust indicator of "global"
warming, regional effects are often of more concern to national and
regional governments and their citizens. For example, in the United
States large increases in summertime heat could affect human health and
agricultural crop productivity. But as Chart 2 shows, surface air
temperatures during the growing season (June, July, and August) over the
12-state Corn Belt for the past 50 years reveal a large discrepancy
between climate models and observations, with all 36 models producing
warming rates well above what has been observed and the most extreme
model producing seven times too much warming.

never mentioned when climate researchers promote climate models for
energy policy decision-making. Instead, they exploit exaggerated model
forecasts of climate change to concoct exaggerated claims of a climate
crisis.**Global Warming of the Lower Atmosphere**While near-surface air
temperatures are clearly important to human activity, the warming
experienced over the low atmosphere (approximately the lowest 10
kilometers of the "troposphere," where the Earth's weather occurs) is
also of interest, especially given the satellite observations of this
layer extending back to 1979.22Roy W. Spencer, John R. Christy, and
William D. Braswell, "UAH Version 6 Global Satellite Temperature

complete coverage of the Earth, except very close to the North and South
Poles.

[Chart 3 shows a comparison of the temperature of this layer as produced
by 38 climate models (red) and how the same layer has been observed to
warm in three radiosonde (weather balloon) datasets (green), three
global reanalysis datasets (which use satellites, weather balloons, and
aircraft data; black), and three satellite datasets (blue).]{.underline}

As seen with the surface air temperature data in Chart 1, the climate
models on average produced too much warming in the lower atmosphere
since 1979: by 43 percent compared to weather balloons, by 55 percent
compared to reanalysis datasets, and by 75 percent compared to satellite
datasets.

So, it is clear that the latest state-of-the-art climate models produce
too much warming compared to the observations. Yet, those models are
used to guide policy in the U.S. and in other countries. This
discrepancy is not widely appreciated by the public because seldom (if
ever) do news media outlets publish stories that do not fit the
narrative that humans are destroying the climate system.

**If Models Warm Too Much, What Do Current Warming Rates Show?**

There is another, simpler way to model energy flows in the climate
system to help answer the question, What do recent rates of global
warming say about future warming? These approaches assume that all the
warming has been due to humans, which is likely not the case.

[The [accumulation of energy in the deep oceans]{.mark} and the observed
rate of warming of the global land and ocean surface [over the past
100-plus years]{.mark} has been [analyzed]{.mark} by
scientists]{.underline}[23]{.underline}

of these energy flows that focuses on the warming observed on land in
the deep oceans since 1970 (the period of highest-quality temperature
measurements and most rapid warming and rise in atmospheric CO~2~)
produced a similar range of future warming of 1.5°C to 2.2°C in response
to 2 x CO~2~. Again, this assumes that all warming has been due to human
activity.

But, might the Earth's atmosphere surpass 2 x CO~2~ in the future? This
depends on highly uncertain projections of future usage of fossil fuels.
The good news is that nature is quite efficient at removing "excess"
CO~2~ from the atmosphere, and, depending on future rates of fossil fuel
burning, it turns out that the atmosphere might not even reach 2 x
CO~2~.25

Marine Science Research and Oceanography, Vol. 6 (2023), pp. 163--170.

[[Why Do Climate Models Produce Too Much Warming?]{.underline}]{.mark}

The tendency for climate models to produce too much warming has at least
two possible explanations.

First, it could be that the forcing---any imposed global energy
imbalance---of the climate system26

Climate.gov, "Climate Forcing,"
https://www.climate.gov/maps-data/climate-data-primer/predicting-climate/climate-forcing
(accessed January 3, 2024).

has been assumed to be too large. The forcing from increasing CO2 (and
other less-important greenhouse gases) is believed to be reasonably well
understood. What is less well understood is the role of particulate air
pollution, especially sulfate aerosols from coal and petroleum burning,
either as a direct reflector of sunlight or an indirect one through
their influence on clouds.

The second possibility is that [[climate models are too sensitive to
forcing]{.mark}. That is, [for a given imposed energy imbalance
from]{.mark} increasing [CO2]{.mark}, [they produce too much
warming]{.mark}. For example, temperature-dependent changes in clouds
and precipitation (the regulator of Earth's main greenhouse gas, water
vapor) within the [models could be unrealistically amplifying the
relatively benign 1.2°C direct warming effect of 2 x
CO2]{.mark}.]{.underline}

**What Else Besides Humans Could Be Producing Climate Change?**

One claim that is often made is that humans must be causing recent
warming since scientists do not know of any other reason. This argument
is not from knowledge, though, but rather from a lack of knowledge. For
example, it is simply not known what caused the coolness of the Little
Ice Age several centuries ago, or the warmth of the Roman Warm Period
(about 2,000 years ago), or the Medieval Warm Period (about 1,000 years
ago). Similarly, the U.S. Dust Bowl of the 1930s existed before most
CO~2~ emissions occurred and it must have had a largely natural origin.
Yet, if another Dust Bowl occurred today, it would certainly be blamed
on human-caused climate change.

Some researchers have published unorthodox evidence for non-CO~2~
origins of climate change, for example, through changes in the transport
of energy from the tropics to high latitudes27

Javier Vinos, Climate of the Past, Present, and Future: A Scientific
Debate, 2nd ed. (Madrid: Critical Science Press, 2022),

(accessed January 3, 2024).

and the sun's modulation of galactic cosmic rays, which in turn can
affect cloud formation.28

Henrik Svensmark, "Influence of Cosmic Rays on Earth's Climate,"
Physical Review Letters, Vol. 81 (1998), pp. 5027--5030.

Since clouds are the Earth's natural sunshade, reducing global
temperatures below what they would be in the absence of clouds, a solar
effect on climate remains a possibility.

Another possibility is a natural change in the global ocean circulation.
Earth's climate is considered a nonlinear dynamical system, capable of
undergoing changes all by itself in the absence of forcing. Since the
oceans are very cold (near 4°C, averaged over their full depth), any
change in the slow overturning circulation of the global oceans would
cause surface temperatures to change. And it is well known that even if
warming (or cooling) originates entirely over the ocean it will be
magnified over land.29

Gilbert P. Compo and Prashant D. Sardeshmukh, "Oceanic Influences on
Recent Continental Warming," Climate Dynamics, Vol. 32 (2009), pp.
333--342, https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-008-0448-9
(accessed January 3, 2024).

This means that one cannot attribute warming to humans just because
warming is larger over land than over the ocean.

**Conclusion**

[[Climate models produce too much warming when compared to observations
over the past fifty years or so]{.mark}, which is the period of most
rapid warming and increases in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. [The
discrepancy ranges from over 40]{.mark} percent [for]{.mark} global
surface [air temperature]{.mark}, about [50]{.mark} percent [for global
lower atmospheric temperatures]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} even [a factor of
two to three for the United States in the summertime]{.mark}. This
discrepancy is never mentioned when those same models are used as the
basis for policy decisions.]{.underline}

Also not mentioned when discussing climate models is their reliance on
the assumption that there are no natural sources of long-term climate
change. The models must be "tuned" to produce no climate change, and
then a human influence is added in the form of a very small, roughly 1
percent change in the global energy balance. While the resulting model
warming is claimed to prove that humans are responsible, clearly this is
circular reasoning. It does not necessarily mean that the claim is
wrong---only that it is based on faith in assumptions about the natural
climate system that cannot be shown to be true from observations.

Finally, possible chaotic internal variations will always lead to
uncertainty in both global warming projections and explanation of past
changes. Given these uncertainties, policymakers should proceed
cautiously and not allow themselves to be influenced by exaggerated
claims based on demonstrably faulty climate models.

[**[S]{.mark}**ecurity to coordinate an]{.underline} [[expert assessment
of]{.underline}]{.mark} [global catastrophic and]{.underline}
[[existential risks]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Department of Homeland
Security published [the first Global Catastrophic Risk
Assessment]{.underline} two weeks ago, and [reached some important ---
and one surprising --- conclusions]{.underline}.1

The legislation provided key definitions:

The term ''[existential]{.underline} [risk'']{.underline}
[means]{.underline} the [potential for an outcome that would result in
human extinction]{.underline}.

The term ''global catastrophic risk'' means the risk of events or
incidents consequential enough to significantly harm or set back human
civilization

at the global scale.

The term ''global catastrophic and existential threats'' means threats
that with varying likelihood may produce consequences severe enough to
result in systemic failure or destruction of critical infrastructure or
significant harm to human civilization.

Congress requested that the assessment focus on six areas of risk:2

the use and development of artificial intelligence (AI);

asteroid and comet impacts;

sudden and severe changes to Earth's climate;

nuclear war;

severe pandemics, whether resulting from naturally occurring events or
from synthetic biology;

supervolcanoes;

Using the key definitions across these six categories, the table below
summarizes my reading of the report.

Below is the full summary table from the report, within which, each
chapter goes into extensive detail on each of the six risk categories.

[The report is well done, and each of the six risk areas are worth their
own focused post here at THB.3 In the remainder of this post, I
highlight what the report says about [climate change]{.mark} --- which
the [report does]{.mark} [not]{.mark} [identify as]{.mark} an
[existential]{.mark} risk.]{.underline}

[The assessment recognizes that [changes]{.mark} in climate
[have]{.mark} many significant [consequences for]{.mark} people and
[ecosystems, but]{.mark} the corresponding [risks are local and
regional]{.mark}, not global:]{.underline}

["An important dynamic of climate change effects is that [any one
mechanism by which climate]{.mark} change [creates risk]{.mark}, such as
those listed above, although potentially devastating on a local to
regional scale, [might not rise to]{.mark} the [level of]{.mark} a
[global]{.mark} catastrophe or an [existential
risk]{.mark}."4]{.underline}

[The report acknowledges diplomatically that [activists]{.mark} often
[characterize]{.mark} [climate]{.mark} change [as]{.mark} an
[existential]{.mark} risk, [which reflects "subjective]{.mark} values
and worldviews" [rather than scientific judgments]{.mark} of real-world
risks:5]{.underline}

"A [strong, international activist movement now exists that engages in
advocacy for addressing climate change. That movement
emphasizes]{.underline} the [urgency]{.underline} of climate change;
sponsors civic engagement efforts, including protest and civil
disobedience, particularly among youths around the globe; [and
argues]{.underline} that [climate change is a potential existential
risk]{.underline}. . . although [social movements]{.underline} reflect a
genuine and legitimate concern about climate change's potential risks to
society, they [are not necessarily grounded in]{.underline} **[objective
assessment]{.underline}** [of those risks]{.underline}."

The [[report]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[acknowledges]{.underline}]{.mark}** some of the **[[extreme

those]{.underline} [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} [the]{.underline}

that]{.underline} [[climate]{.underline}]{.mark} [change]{.underline}

health risk]{.underline}]{.mark} --- **[[even
over]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[the course of]{.underline}** **[[a

"Although there is no accepted determination of what would constitute a
global catastrophic health risk from climate change, authors of at least
one report defined it as a mass-mortality event taking the equivalent of
25 percent of the population. For the United States, based on the 2020
population (330 million), percent would mean approximately 80 million
people, or 2 billion for the estimated global population in 2022 of 8
billion. . . Mortality of this magnitude would effectively be ten times
that of the 1918 influenza pandemic. These values suggest a very high
bar for catastrophic risk. . . **[[No published
study]{.underline}]{.mark}** [has]{.underline}
[[suggested]{.underline}]{.mark} [the possibility of a
singular]{.underline} [[mass-mortality]{.underline}]{.mark}
[event]{.underline} of this magnitude, [[nor]{.underline}]{.mark} [is

[[pathogenesis]{.mark}, that would]{.underline} [[result in
such]{.underline}]{.mark} [high rates of]{.underline}
[[mortality]{.underline}]{.mark}. Even with cumulative losses over a
century, mortality would not meet these thresholds."

The **[[bottom line]{.underline}]{.mark}**: Climate change is important
and poses significant risks that will require continued policy
development and implementation in mitigation and adaptation --- but
**[[climate]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[change]{.underline}** **[[is
not]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[an]{.underline}**
**[[existential]{.underline}]{.mark}** [**risk**. The world does indeed
face existential risks and we should take care that concern over climate
does not overshadow these other risks]{.underline}.

Last night I had the chance to give a talk to a wonderful group of
thoughtful and informed normal folks in downtown Denver. After the event
a women came up to me and asked if I was afraid of climate change. I
responded that I was not, for the simple reason that despite the very
real risks of changes in climate, we are focused on those risks. I told
her that I worry much more about the things that we are not paying
attention to, noting that the COVID-19 pandemic arose following a long
period where there was little attention or concern about pandemics among
most scientists or policy makers.

In a paper I wrote almost a decade ago, I warned that the catastrophes
of the 21st century may --- like COVID-19 --- come from places not at
the center of our attention:

I suggest three types of catastrophes lie ahead. The familiar -- hazards
that we have come to expect based on experience and knowledge, such as
earthquakes and typhoons. The emergent -- hazards that are the product
of a complex, interconnected world, such as financial meltdowns, supply
chain disruption and epidemics. The extraordinary \-- hazards that may
or may not be foreseen or foreseeable, but for which we are wholly
unprepared, such as an asteroid impact, massive solar storm, or even
fantastic scenarios found only in fiction, such as the consequences of
contact with alien life. I will argue that our collective attention and
expertise is, perhaps understandably, disproportionately focused on the
familiar. The consequence, however, is a sort of intellectual myopia. We
know more than we think about the familiar and less than we should about
the emergent and the extraordinary. Yet our ability to deal with the
hazards of the future likely depends much more on our ability to prepare
for the emergent and the extraordinary.

The [first Global Catastrophic Risk assessment by the U.S. government is
an excellent starting point for a continuing discussion about
catastrophic risks]{.underline} and how we might better prepare for
them. It tells us that [where our focus lies may not be where we find
the greatest risks]{.underline}.

MAD.

I have argued that the [["plausible" risks]{.underline}]{.mark} [of
climate change]{.underline} [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} commonly
[[exaggerated]{.underline}]{.mark} within the climate community. [Recall
for example, Christiana Figueres, 2020, "The scary thing is that after
2030 it basically doesn't really matter what humans do]{.underline}";
Kevin Drum, 2019, "\[The Green New Deal\] would only change the dates
for planetary suicide by a decade or so"; Frank Fenner, 2010, "We're
going to become extinct. Whatever we do now is too late." Many more in
the same doomsday vein. We have seen that the
[[standard]{.underline}]{.mark} [global]{.underline} [[warming models
have a]{.underline}]{.mark} [powerful]{.underline} [[built-in bias to
exaggerate the rate of future temperature rise]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[as seen in]{.underline}]{.mark} (most of) them "[[hindcasting"
temp]{.underline}]{.mark}erature [[rises]{.underline}]{.mark} several
times [[faster than actually observed]{.underline}]{.mark}. We have seen
that [[forecasters]{.underline}]{.mark} commonly [[take "worst-case
scenarios" as "likely scenarios]{.underline}]{.mark} [in the absence of
radical action"]{.underline} ([eg reaching net zero carbon emissions by
2050]{.underline}), to the point where Nature recently published a paper
sub-titled, "Stop using the worst-case scenario for climate warming as
the most likely outcome". [The dismaying thing is that]{.underline}
[[scientists]{.underline}]{.mark} [and advocates]{.underline} [[have
been making catastrophising]{.underline}]{.mark} [global warming
forecasts of this kind]{.underline} [[for decades]{.underline}]{.mark}
[past, normally]{.underline} [[dated some 10 to 30 years into the
future]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The due date comes without catastrophe,
but never a retrospective holding to account.]{.underline} [Rather, on
to the next catastrophising forecast another 10 to 30 years
ahead.]{.underline} Scientists-writers-activists know the catastrophe
forecasts get the attention, the clicks, the research funding. We saw
the exaggeration mechanism spelled out by Richard Betts of the BBC,
Holman Jenkins of the Wall St Journal, and climate scientist Judith
Curry. The built-in exaggeration of the costs of climate change blunts
the parallel with nuclear power plants. We know with high certainty the
costs of nuclear explosions. We know the costs of global temperature
going above 1.5 C above "pre-industrial" much less certainly, and we can
see the mechanisms by which the likely costs are being systematically
exaggerated. On the other hand, there is abundant evidence that even
without the doomsday exaggerations the plausible risks of climate change
could be very serious, in particular because of the inherent political
economy difficulty of getting needed global or regional cooperation when
political action is mostly at the level of sovereign nation states (see
the G20). Coal power generation is the single biggest source of GHG
emissions, and emissions from coal consumption will probably not fall
fast, whatever the promises. First, coal is cheap, accessible and
generates reliable power for many developing countries; in Asia, coal
alone generates 40 percent of energy consumption, much higher than the
world average of 29 percent. (12) Second, developing countries,
including China, assert a strong claim on carbon space to power their
economic development. They see it partly as a matter of fundamental
justice, since developed countries emitted most of the CO2 that is
already in the atmosphere and seas as the necessary condition for them
becoming developed. Developed countries promise finance and technical
assistance on a massive scale to accelerate the energy transition in
developing countries -- and have a long track record of leaving promises
as promises. (See the global distribution of Covid vaccines. See the
results of vaunted "voting reform" in the World Bank, leaving the US
with 17% and China with 6%.) What is more, the Japanese government plans
up to 22 new coal power plants, as it closes nuclear plants in the wake
of Fukushima. Then comes a question: does drawing attention to the
doomsday exaggerations of the CCC -- "disaster", "catastrophe",
"extinction", "fiddling while the planet burns" - serve to reduce the
political and public pressures for necessary ameliorative action, in a
world where powerful fossil lobbies seek to block or delay such action
for reasons independent of "evidence"? Should "Third Way" essays like
this one not be published, because "give them (deniers, sceptics) an
inch and they will take a mile"? To what extent must mass publics be
"panicked" in order to induce enough collective political and business
action -- national, international -- to substantially slow the growth of
GHG emissions? If we can sustain emission- and temperature-curbing
action only by holding up the certainty of disaster, catastrophe,
extinction, then better to let the doomsday exaggerations continue as
the necessary condition for that ameliorative action. What is the harm,
when the alternative is ruin for humanity and the biosphere? The danger
is that the repeated wild exaggerations produce a public backlash, a
discrediting, and a strengthening of the many "deniers" who see
"leftists, governments, and the United Nations" as the source of
malevolence in the world. A more accurate accounting of the evidence
would (hopefully) produce a more calibrated and sustained public and
business response. What to do? (13) The IPCC should allocate some 10% of
its budget to a Red Team, dedicated to independent scrutiny of its
evidence and conclusions (especially the Summary for Policymakers). (14)
The IPCC should revise its mandate to require it explicitly to focus on
interactions between natural forces and human actions, as it is now
almost required not to, biassing its assessment of the state of
scientific knowledge towards "man-made global warming" as an almost
separate system. Learned societies should more actively seek to
understand and publicize the reasons for repeated large-scale
discrepancies between "hindcasts" and "forecasts" on the one hand and
actual observations on the other, discrepancies strongly biased towards
"disaster". It is particularly important that the knee-jerk attribution
of extreme weather events to global warming be challenged with reference
to evidence. Judith Curry explained -- quoted earlier \-- why [CCC
advocates have a powerful incentive to attribute cases of extreme
weather to global warming, tout court]{.underline}. She has recently
written, "[Apart from the reduced frequency of the coldest temperatures,
the signal of global warming in the statistics of extreme weather events
remains much smaller than that from natural climate variability, and is
expected to remain so at least until the second half of the 21rst
century]{.underline}." She goes on to amplify a point made earlier about
the limits of the [[climate models]{.underline}]{.mark} used for the
IPCC assessment reports: they [[are driven]{.underline}]{.mark} [mainly
by]{.underline} [[predictions]{.underline}]{.mark} of future GHG
emissions. [[They do not include predictions of
natural]{.underline}]{.mark} climate [[variability]{.underline}]{.mark}
[arising from solar output, volcanic eruptions or evolution of
large-scale multi-decadal ocean circulations.]{.underline} [[They do
a]{.underline}]{.mark} particularly [[poor job of
simulating]{.underline}]{.mark} regional and
[[decadal-scale]{.underline}]{.mark} climate
[[variability.]{.underline}]{.mark} (15) Participants on both sides have
to learn the art of respecting the principle of free speech while
maintaining the standards of civil discourse. While I have stressed the
CCC's support for urgent and radical changes to the way we live, work
and govern, some CCC champions argue that the world economy could
continue on a largely unchanged growth trajectory provided that we
switch fast from fossil fuels to renewables. Indeed, this switch is
beginning to happen fast, with coal and nuclear energy production unable
to compete without subsidies in areas where natural gas, wind and solar
resources are readily available. But to say that life can continue as
before provided we substitute renewables for fossil fuels obscures the
huge difficulties for many developing countries of getting out of fossil
fuels while growing fast enough to reduce the income gap with developed
countries. We must give high priority to investments in "clean coal"
technologies, such as carbon capture, storage and use, to make the
dirtier coal cleaner in existing and new coal-power plants; and link
coal-power retirement to the coming on-stream of attractive
alternatives. The multilateral development banks have recently or will
soon announce bans on coal power. The G7 leaders meeting in mid 2021
promised to stop using government funds to finance new international
coal power plants by the end of 2021. China's Belt and Road Initiative
should increase its pressure on host countries to cut back on dirty coal
and boost clean coal and renewables. A high and immediate priority is to
build a robust financing and technical assistance mechanism for help
from developed to developing countries. The Paris Agreement instituted a
Mitigation pillar and an Adaptation pillar. Intense debate took place
around the third, Loss and Damage, the name of a mechanism to compensate
for the destruction that Mitigation and Adaptation cannot prevent.
Developed countries by and large have sought to marginalize the Loss and
Damage pillar, as they have long sought to marginalize Special and
Differential Treatment for developing countries in trade and investment
agreements. "Finance is something that really rich countries,
particularly the US, have made sure that there is no progress and not
even discussion on", remarked Harjeet Singh, senior advisor at Climate
Action Network International. (16) My "forecast" is that [[in the
next]{.underline}]{.mark} [two to three]{.underline}
[[decades]{.underline}]{.mark} to midcentury [we will make rapid
progress in scientific knowledge about weather and climate, helped by
longer and more accurate satellite and ocean records and by a new
generation of climate models that operate at one to ten kilometers scale
(as distinct from the current models' 50 kilometer scale).]{.underline}
[[We will]{.underline}]{.mark} probably continue to
[[make]{.underline}]{.mark} rapid [[progress in
decoupling]{.underline}]{.mark} GHG from GDP growth, with a combination
of state direction-setting and private innovation focused on
transformations in energy, transport, buildings, industry and
agriculture, using incentives like research and development subsidies
and tax credits for technology investment, and penalties for

century could well experience globally extreme climate and ocean events,
we will be much more knowledgeable about what to do than we are today.

### No Climate extinction

[Climate change is an issue I care passionately about and have dedicated
a significant portion of my life to addressing. I have been politically
active on the issue for over 20 years and have researched and written
about it for 17 years. Over the last four years, my organization,
Environmental Progress, has worked with some of the world's leading
climate scientists to prevent carbon emissions from rising. So far,
we've helped prevent emissions increasing the equivalent of adding 24
million cars to the road.]{.underline} I also care about getting the
facts and science right and have in recent months corrected inaccurate
and apocalyptic news media coverage of fires in the Amazon and fires in
California, both of which have been improperly presented as resulting
primarily from climate change. Journalists and activists alike have an
obligation to describe environmental problems honestly and accurately,
even if they fear doing so will reduce their news value or salience with
the public. There is good evidence that the catastrophist framing of
climate change is self-defeating because it alienates and polarizes many
people. And exaggerating climate change risks distracting us from other
important issues including ones we might have more near-term control
over. I feel the need to say this up-front because I want the issues I'm
about to raise to be taken seriously and not dismissed by those who
label as "climate deniers" or "climate delayers" anyone who pushes back
against exaggeration. With that out of the way, let's look whether the
science supports what's being said. [First, [no credible scientific body
has]{.mark} ever [said climate change threatens the collapse of
civilization much less the extinction of the human
species]{.mark}.]{.underline} "'Our children are going to die in the
next 10 to 20 years.' What's the scientific basis for these claims?"
BBC's Andrew Neil asked a visibly uncomfortable XR spokesperson last
month. "These claims have been disputed, admittedly," she said. "There
are some scientists who are agreeing and some who are saying it's not
true. But the overall issue is that these deaths are going to happen."
"But most scientists don't agree with this," said Neil. "I looked
through IPCC reports and see no reference to billions of people going to
die, or children in 20 years. How would they die?" "Mass migration
around the world already taking place due to prolonged drought in
countries, particularly in South Asia. There are wildfires in Indonesia,
the Amazon rainforest, Siberia, the Arctic," she said. [But in saying
so, the XR spokesperson had grossly misrepresented the science. "[There
is]{.mark} robust [evidence of disasters displacing people]{.mark}
worldwide," notes IPCC, "but [limited evidence]{.mark} that [climate
change]{.mark} or sea-level rise [is the direct cause]{.mark}" [What
about "mass migration"?]{.mark} "The [majority of]{.mark} resultant
[population movements tend to occur within]{.mark} the borders of
[affected countries]{.mark},\" [says IPCC.]{.mark}]{.underline} It's not
like climate doesn't matter. It's that climate change is outweighed by
other factors. Earlier this year, researchers found that climate "has
affected organized armed conflict within countries. However, other
drivers, such as low socioeconomic development and low capabilities of
the state, are judged to be substantially more influential." Last
January, after climate scientists criticized Rep. Ocasio-Cortez for
saying the world would end in 12 years, her spokesperson said \"We can
quibble about the phraseology, whether it\'s existential or
cataclysmic." [He added, "We\'re seeing lots of \[climate
change-related\] problems that are already impacting lives.\" That last
part may be true, but it's also true that [economic development has made
us less vulnerable]{.mark}, which is why there was a [99.7% decline in
the death toll from natural disasters since its peak]{.mark} in 1931. In
1931, 3.7 million people died from natural disasters. In 2018, just
11,000 did. And that decline occurred over a period when the global
population quadrupled. [What about sea level rise?]{.mark} IPCC
estimates sea level could rise two feet (0.6 meters) by 2100. Does that
sound apocalyptic or even "unmanageable"? Consider that [one-third of
the Netherlands is below sea level]{.mark}, and some areas are seven
meters below sea level. You might object that Netherlands is rich while
Bangladesh is poor. But the [Netherlands adapted to living below sea
level 400 years ago. Technology has improved]{.mark} a bit since then.
[What about claims of crop failure, famine, and mass death? That's
science fiction, not science]{.mark}. Humans today produce [enough food
for 10 billion people, or 25% more than we need]{.mark}, and scientific
bodies predict increases in that share, not declines. The United Nations
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) forecasts [crop yields
increasing 30% by 2050]{.mark}. And the poorest parts of the world, like
sub-Saharan Africa, are expected to see increases of 80 to 90%. [Nobody
is suggesting climate change won't]{.mark} negatively [impact crop
yields]{.mark}. It could.]{.underline} But such declines should be put
in perspective[. [Wheat yields increased 100 to 300%]{.mark} around the
world [since the 1960s]{.mark}, [while a study]{.mark} of 30 models
[found that yields would decline by 6% for every one degree Celsius
increase in temperature]{.mark}. Rates of [future yield]{.mark} growth
[depend far more on]{.mark} whether [poor nations get access to
tractors,]{.mark} [irrigation, and fertilizer than on climate
change,]{.mark} says FAO. All of this helps explain why [IPCC
anticipates climate change will have a modest impact on economic
growth]{.mark}. By [2100]{.mark}, IPCC projects [the global economy will
be 300 to 500% larger than it is today]{.mark}. Both [IPCC]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} the [Nobel-winning Yale economist]{.mark}, William
Nordhaus, [predict that warming]{.mark} of 2.5°C and 4°C [would
reduce]{.mark} gross domestic product ([GDP)]{.mark} [by 2% and 5% over
that same period.]{.mark}]{.underline} Does this mean we shouldn't worry
about climate change? Not at all. One of the reasons I work on climate
change is because I worry about the impact it could have on endangered
species. Climate change may threaten one million species globally and
half of all mammals, reptiles, and amphibians in diverse places like the
Albertine Rift in central Africa, home to the endangered mountain
gorilla. [But [it's not]{.mark} the case [that "we're putting our own
survival in danger" through extinctions]{.mark}, as Elizabeth Kolbert
claimed in her book, Sixth Extinction. [As tragic as animal extinctions
are, they do not threaten human civilization]{.mark}. If we want to save
endangered species, we need to do so because we care about wildlife for
spiritual, ethical, or aesthetic reasons, not survival
ones.]{.underline}

\]

Canada's chattering classes claim that climate change is one of the
country's pre-eminent threats. This is extraordinary. Canada is
experiencing a productivity showdown the worst decline in living
standards in 40 years, and growth rates that lag in most developed
countries. Geopolitical threats loom, the healthcare system is under
stress and education is faltering. Yet the federal government has spent
or committed more than \$160 billion on climate initiatives since 2015,
and is funneling \$5.3 billion to help poor countries respond to climate
change. Like most nations, Canada faces tough decisions in coming
decades. Resources spent on climate will not be not available for
health, education, security or boosting prosperity. Global warming is a
problem. Science has shown quite clearly that [[more
CO₂]{.underline}](https://financialpost.com/tag/greenhouse-gases/),
mostly from fossil fuel use, increases global temperatures. Climate
economics has shown how this brings both problems and benefits (for
instance, more deaths caused by heat, fewer by cold) but, overall, more
problems than benefits. More CO₂ means higher social costs, so reducing
CO₂ does have real benefits. [[But climate policies also have
costs]{.underline}]{.mark}. They force families and businesses to use
more expensive energy, which slows economic growth. You might have heard
otherwise but if the new ways really were cheaper, no regulations or
mandates would be needed. [If climate change were treated like any other
political issue, we would openly recognize these trade-offs and try to
balance them to get the most climate benefits for the least cost,
recognizing that climate policies need to compete against many other
worthy policies. First, [people say --- wrongly --- that global warming
is an existential challenge, risking the end of mankind.]{.mark} Of
course, if the world is about to end, it follows that any spending is
justified. After all, if a world-obliterating meteor is hurtling towards
us, we don't ask about the costs of avoiding it.]{.underline} Second, it
is also often claimed --- somewhat contradictorily --- that the [[green
transition]{.underline}](https://financialpost.com/tag/green-transition/)
will make energy cheaper, societies safer and everyone richer. In this
"rainbows and unicorns" scenario, there are no trade-offs and we can
afford climate policy *and* everything else. Both claims
[[are]{.underline}](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/news/2024/05/budget-2024-a-clean-and-safe-environment-for-the-next-generation.html)
[[repeated]{.underline}](https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2024/07/09/prime-ministers-remarks-celebration-event-nato-climate-change-and-security)
ad nauseam by Canadian politicians and activists and spread by media
hooked on selling climate catastrophes and green utopias. But both are
quite untrue. That is why I'm writing this series. I will outline how
many of the most sensationalist, scary climate stories are misleading or
wrong and ignore the best climate science. Being data-driven, I will
show you this with the best peer-reviewed data and numbers. So: *Is*
climate change the world's all-encompassing problem today? One way to
test this is to look at [[extreme
weather]{.underline}](https://financialpost.com/tag/extreme-weather/),
which we constantly hear is having an ever-larger impact on our
societies. But the data paint a very different picture (see chart). [We
have good evidence for the number of people killed [in climate-related
disasters,]{.mark} i.e., floods, storms, droughts, and fires. (We'll
look at temperature deaths next week.) [A century ago, such disasters
routinely killed hundreds of thousands, even millions of people in a
single disaster.]{.mark} On average, about half a million people a year
died in such disasters. Since then, [the death toll has]{.mark} declined
precipitously. The last decade saw an average of fewer than 10,000
deaths per year, [a decline of more than 97 per cent.]{.mark} Of course,
over the past century the [world's population has quadrupled, which
means the risk per person has dropped even more, and is now down by more
than 99 per cent]{.mark}. Why this great success story? Because richer,
more resilient societies with better technology and forecasting are much
better able to protect their citizens. That doesn't mean there is no
climate signal at all, but rather that [technology and adaptation
entirely swamp its impact]{.mark}. In the same way, [climate's impact on
overall human welfare is also quite small.]{.mark} In proportion to
the]{.underline} [[total
economy](https://financialpost.com/tag/green-economy/), the [cost of
climate-related disasters has been]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[[declining](https://x.com/BjornLomborg/status/1881623527922536687)
since 1990.]{.mark} Looking to the future, the best estimates of the
total economic impact of climate change come from]{.underline}
[[two]{.underline}](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2312030121)
[[major](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421523005074)
meta-studies by two of the most respected climate economists. Each shows
that end-of-century GDP, instead of being 350 per cent higher, will only
be 335 per cent higher.]{.underline} "Only" becoming 335 per cent richer
is a problem, to be sure, but not an existential threat. Despite that,
as this series will show, many of the most draconian climate policy
proposals so casually tossed around these days will do little to fix
climate but could dramatically lower future growth and the opportunities
of future generations.

### AT Arctic Tipping Points

#### No tipping points for Arctic sea ice -- winter seasons prevents runaway ice melt

**NSIDC**, 12/17/**21**, (National Snow and Ice Data Center), "Does
Arctic sea ice have a tipping point?"
https://nsidc.org/learn/ask-scientist/does-arctic-sea-ice-have-tipping-point,
mm

[Scientists once thought that [Arctic sea ice]{.mark} could have a
[tipping point]{.mark}]{.underline} because the upper ocean layer would
retain too much heat, warming too much for sea ice to form again once
melted. "[This]{.underline}, however, [[has not stood up to
modeling]{.underline},]{.mark}" said Ted Scambos from the University of
Colorado Boulder. Though Arctic sea ice has no definitive threshold, it
is showing a rather significant trend in sea ice loss. Since the early
2000s, tipping points have emerged on the Antarctic and Greenland Ice
Sheets, with a major global current known as the Atlantic Meridional
Overturning Circulation (AMOC), and permafrost thaw. The question then
begged to be asked of Arctic sea ice. [A tipping point in the Arctic
Ocean would mean losing so much ice that its heat-reflecting effects are
severely diminished, leading to more and more ice loss]{.underline}.
With this vicious cycle in place, ice could not recover to its previous
summertime levels. After Arctic sea ice hit a record low in 2007, some
scientists considered the possibility that sea ice has already passed
this tipping point. [A 2011 modeling study]{.underline} from researchers
at the Max Planck Institute in Germany [suggeste]{.underline}d that sea
ice could recover quickly, **[[even if all the ice melted in the
summer]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[showing that the [feedback effects that
would lead to a downward spiral in ice extent may be weaker than
suspected]{.mark}. The study shed some good news for the
Arctic.]{.underline} Researchers from the study do not argue against the
mainstream view that a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean is inevitable.
The issue is how we get there---with or without a tipping point.
[Another study from 2016 showed that]{.underline} the decline in the
observed sea ice extent correlates well with the increase in CO2
emissions. It is not a perfect match because there is variability in the
ice extent from year-to-year, but "[[runaway" ice loss is not
seen]{.underline}]{.mark}. This agrees with the 2011 modeling study.
[[The key]{.mark} to Arctic sea ice not having a tipping point
[is]{.mark} its [winter]{.mark}s]{.underline}. [[Arctic winters are
shrouded in complete darkness and air temperatures drop below
freezing]{.underline}]{.mark}. [This causes the ocean to lose
heat---enough for ice to rapidly form and grow and survive the next
summer\'s melt]{.underline}

[**[Indigenous leaders are urging The United States]{.mark}** and other
arctic states [**to step up** cooperation to tackle wildfires,
as]{.mark} record b[lazes tear across the region.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[Unusually hot weather along with dry thunderstorms [this summer]{.mark}
have combined to turn [the Arctic Circle]{.mark} into a tinder
box.]{.underline} More than 2.4 million acres of forest have burst into
flames in Alaska. 13 million acres -- an area bigger than Belgium --
have burned in Siberia, Russia, unleashing plumes of smoke the size of
the European Union. Meanwhile, fires continues to sweep through Northern
Canada. Edward Alexander, co-chair of Gwich'in Council International
(GCI), a body representing the rights of 11,000 people in the indigenous
territory of Alaska and permanent member of the Arctic Council, told
Climate Home News that the region could no longer look south for
emergency assistance, but had to build its own resilience. In the event
of extreme wildfires, states have been known to request firefighters
from southern countries. July of last year was one example, when Sweden
sought emergency assistance from the European Union and Turkey. "What
we've tried to say is: 'Let's look to the north to solve some of these
problems, let's look across the pole, and remember that there are
resources around the table that we could bring to bear on new
problems'," Alexander said. "Whether that's understanding the problems
from a scientific point of view, or coordinating our emergency
management systems and having some sort of agreement that's based on the
best practices of the region." US breaks from Arctic consensus on
climate change The group submitted a proposal to increase cooperation
among Arctic states at the the Emergency Prevention, Preparedness and
Response (EPPR) working group of the Arctic Council in June. Founded in
1996, the Arctic Council seeks to encourage cooperation between Arctic
countries, especially in the area of environmental protection. Member
states include Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden
and the United States, while six indigenous groups also sit in the
negotiations as permanent participants. The proposal would see states
develop training partnerships to fight fires specific to the local
ecosystems such as the taiga and pool expertise on fire management,
including from indigenous communities. It garnered enthusiasm, one
source told CHN, with the US also stepping in to suggest creating a
regional inventory of firefighters. "It's a big deal," said Alexander.
"[[Not just as an emergency response, but as a response to climate
change]{.mark}. [Wildland fire is not just an effect of climate change
anymore, it's also becoming a significant driver of climate
change]{.mark}, and we really need to understand what's going on there
in the north. **[We also need to better work together to address the

Understanding fire behavior is a crucial step in wildfire risk
assessment and management. Accurate and near real-time knowledge of the
spatio-temporal characteristics of fuels is critical for analyzing
pre-fire risk mitigation and managing active-fire emergency response.
[[Geospatial modeling and land cover mapping using remote sensing
combined with artificial intelligence techniques can provide fuel
information at regional scales with high accuracy and
resolution]{.underline}]{.mark}, as evidenced by the extensive recent
work in the literature that appeared with increasing volume in the open
literature. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the
state-of-the-art in wildfire fuel mapping, focusing on the research
frontier of fire fuel models, fuel mapping methods, remote sensing data
sources, existing datasets/reference maps, and applicable artificial
intelligence techniques. The main findings highlight the increasing
research on fire fuel mapping worldwide, with a considerable emphasis on
multispectral imagery and the Random Forest classifier for its efficacy
with limited data. The majority of these studies concentrate on
relatively limited geographical scales spanning a small variety of fuel
types, thus leaving a gap in regional and national-scale mapping.
Further, this review focuses on identifying the major challenges in
wildfire fuel mapping and viable solutions as they relate to (i) ground
truth data scarcity, (ii) mapping understory vegetation, (iii) temporal
latency, and (iv) lack of uncertainty-aware models. Lastly, this paper
identifies potential AI-driven solutions that promise a significant leap
in fuel mapping and discusses the latest developments and potential
future trends in AI-based fuel mapping applications.

## 2AC -- Canada Counterplan

#### Coop [fails]{.underline}\-\--Trump thinks he doesn't [need]{.underline} Canada and won't cooperate. Current disagreements prove.

**Associated Press 25** \[The Associated Press; "Trump says Canada would
'cease to exist' if it weren't for the U.S., days before pivotal
election: 'I have to be honest, as a state, it works great'," Fortune,
4/24/25;
https://fortune.com/article/trump-canada-cease-to-exist-werent-for-us-days-before-pivotal-election/\]//EG

- \*Can probably make argument that only US doing the plan first and
  then follow-on works, because otherwise Trump ego prevents coop.

[Trump reinserted himself]{.underline} into Canada's election during a
signing ceremony inside the Oval Office, [saying **Canada** "**would
cease to exist** as a country" if the U.S. stopped buying its
goods.]{.underline}

"I have to be honest, as a state, it works great," said Trump, who
previously threatened to make the country the 51st state through
economic coercion.

[Trump reiterated his claim that the **U.S. doesn't need anything from
Canada** --- including autos and oil.]{.underline}

["We don't really want Canada to make cars for us, to put it bluntly. We
want to make our own cars," Trump said.]{.underline}

In recent weeks, Trump has dialed back his talk of Canada becoming the
51st state. He stopped saying it after a call with new Prime Minister
Mark Carney last month.

Trump also suggested Wednesday that he might increase import taxes on
cars from Canada. Trump has a 25% tariff on autos, although there are
some exemptions related to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement on
trade, and automakers are seeking other policy changes to minimize the
tariff burden. Trump has separate 25% tariffs on Canadian goods ---
ostensibly to address drug smuggling into the U.S.

["I really don't want cars from Canada," Trump said. "So when I put
tariffs on Canada, they're paying 25%, but that could go up in terms of
cars. When we put tariffs on, all we're doing is we're saying, '**We
don't want your cars**, in all due respect.'"]{.underline}

[Trump cautioned that he's not currently considering additional auto
tariffs, but he said there could be an increase.]{.underline}

Carney said last week that eliminating trade barriers within Canada
would benefit Canadians as he made his case to retain power ahead of an
April 28 vote. Carney has set a goal of free trade within the country's
10 provinces and three territories by July 1. Canada has long had
interprovincial trade barriers.

#### Canada doesn't have the [experience]{.underline} nor [funds]{.underline}.

**Green '23** \[Kenneth P. Green, Fraser Institute senior fellow and

and a bachelor's degree in general biology from UCLA; "Canada's burning
because of bad forest policy, not climate change," Fraser Institute,
6/9/23;
https://www.fraserinstitute.org/commentary/canadas-burning-because-bad-forest-policy-not-climate-change\]//EG

But what about Canada per se? [Is it clear that Canada's fire issues are
climate-driven?]{.underline} Unless one believes that inverse
correlations suggest causality, [the answer is no. That's according to a
2020 study in the journal Progress in Disaster Science where authors
Tymstra et al. show a fairly sharp declining trend in the number of
fires (annually) over time, and a mixed record of areas burned, though
the authors note an apparent increase in areas burned over the last two
decades.]{.underline}

[In fact, as average atmospheric temperatures have risen from 1970 to
2017, Canadian forest fires have declined sharply in number and show
little obvious trend in areas burnt.]{.underline}

Crucially, Tymstra's study also finds that [wildfire management policy
in Canada comes up short. "A major barrier in Canada... is the
**inadequate funding** to support the vision of an innovative and
integrated approach to wildfire management]{.underline}. Mitigation
funding has followed wildfire disasters but not at the same level to
mitigate flood and earthquake disasters. [Despite the increasing
occurrence of wildfire disasters in Canada, funding to support wildfire
prevention, mitigation and preparedness have **not kept pace** with the
increasing need to mitigate the impacts from wildfires, and be better
prepared when they do arrive."]{.underline}

[More specifically, Tymstra et al. find that Canada has **failed** to
fund the **proactive management** of forest fires sufficiently and is
**not poised to do better** moving forward]{.underline}. "Wildfire
management agencies in Canada are at a tipping point. Presuppression
\[sic\] and suppression costs are increasing but program budgets are
not." But clearly, [a lack of fire suppression is also a
problem:]{.underline} "Wildfire suppression contributes to a wildfire
problem but paradoxically it is wildfire use that will help to solve
this problem. [The wildfire management toolbox must include wildfire use
to manage wildfires at the landscape scale because it is not feasible to
effectively use prescribed burns and/or fuel management treatments alone
to restore expansive wildfire-dependent ecosystems]{.underline}." That's
a somewhat academic long-winded way of saying you need to fight fire
with fire, but the point is valid nonetheless.

[Canada is having a hell of a fire season, there's no disputing
that.]{.underline} And it's producing hellish landscapes across Canada
and North America. What it is not, however, is a call to more of the
same old "climate action." [But rather, a call for more sane real-world
real-time management of fire risk in Canada's forests, a practise that
Canadian governments have **failed** at for **decades**.]{.underline}

#### Canada [can't]{.underline} lead wildfire management\-\--capacity low now. 

**Isai & Austen 23** \[Vjosa Isai, reporter and researcher for NYT,

Behind the Need," The New York Times, 6/9/23;
https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/09/world/canada/canada-firefighting-capacity.html\]//EG

[Canada's capacity to prevent wildfires has been **shrinking for
decades** because of **budget cuts**, a loss of some of the country's
forest service **staff**, and **onerous rules** for fire prevention,
turning some of its forests into a tinderbox.]{.underline}

As residents braced for what could be the worst wildfire season on
record, and one that is far from over, the air slowly cleared over the
Northeastern United States on Friday, but hundreds of wildfires
continued to burn across Canada.

Thanks to some rain and cloud cover near wildfire areas, with scattered
rains expected in parts of southern Ontario on Sunday, Steven Flisfeder,
a warning preparedness meteorologist at Environment and Climate Change
Canada, predicted that the weekend could bring better air quality in
Toronto, the country's largest city.

"That's going to help flush out the contaminants from the air a little
bit," he said.

[More than 1,100 firefighters from around the world have been dispatched
across Canada to help combat the country's raging fire season, officials
said, including groups from France, Chile, Costa Rica, the United
States, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.]{.underline}

Wildfire emergency response management is handled by each of the 10
provinces and three territories in Canada, but hundreds of blazes across
the country have stretched local resources thin, and renewed calls for a
national firefighting service.

[At a time when many Canadians are asking if the country has enough
wildfire fighting resources, several experts say the government should
be focused on doing all it can to prevent wildfires, a focus from which
it has strayed since budget cuts imposed in the 1990s that hampered the
nation's forest service.]{.underline}

["We need to do more to get ahead of the problem," said Mike Flannigan,
who studies wildfires at Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops, British
Columbia, a community in the heart of that province's wildfire country.
"And progress on that has been slow, primarily because we are kind of
stuck in this paradigm that fire suppression is the
solution."]{.underline}

[People who study Canada's response say it's been weakened by a variety
of forces, including local and national budget cuts for forests,
cumbersome safeguards for fire prevention and a steep reduction in the
number of forest service employees.]{.underline}

British Columbia spent 801 million Canadian dollars (about \$601
million) on fighting forest fires during the unusually hot year 2021
wildfire season, which saw fire wipe out the town of Lytton. But the
province's current wildfire prevention budget is just 32 million dollars
a year.

[Similar disparities exist in other provinces, which tend to invest in
small, community-based programs that protect villages and towns rather
than mitigating the risk of fire throughout forests, increasing the
threat of out-of-control wildfires.]{.underline}

The small programs are helpful, involving measures like clearing forest
floors on the periphery of towns and creating fire breaks between
settlements and forests. But to reduce runaway wildfires, broader
measures are necessary, experts said.

One of the fire prevention methods that Canada should expand, experts
said, is prescribed burns, a practice that involves setting a specific
area on fire under controlled conditions to incinerate trees, dead
branches, brush and other materials that could otherwise be fuel for
wildfires.

It also stimulates ecological restoration, clearing the canopy cover to
allow sunlight to reach the forest floor and promote new growth, as well
as opening the cones of some tree species to free seeds.

"It's a great technique, but we haven't used it that much in Canada,"
said Daniel Perrakis, a fire scientist at the Canadian Forest Service.
"With climate change, we're clearly seeing different fire behavior."

Some communities of Indigenous people --- whom wildfires
disproportionately affect because they often live in fire-prone areas
--- have hewed to the practice of controlled burning.

Two years ago, while a record-breaking heat wave exacerbated wildfires
across British Columbia, some of the flames roared close to the Westbank
First Nation, an Indigenous community in the Okanagan Valley. But years
of thinning the forest and managing their land using cultural burning
practices prevented the fire from causing any major damage to the
community.

Across Canada, there are a handful of controlled burns each year,
according to partial figures compiled by the National Forestry Database.
Foresters seeking to perform them must go through a lengthy process to
get approval from a province.

The burns are generally unpopular in places like public parks, and even
more so when they go wrong. In 1995, more than 1,000 people were
evacuated after a prescribed burn got out of control and threatened the
town of Dubreuilville, Ontario.

In some fire seasons, the duration of the approval process exceeds the
narrow window when weather conditions are favorable for controlled
burns.

[The rules minimize the risk of an out-of-control prescribed burn, but
they increase the risk of an out-of-control wildfire.]{.underline}

["Essentially, you've handcuffed folks --- foresters and silviculturists
--- from being able to get off successful prescribed burns because we
made the rules so onerous and so restrictive" causing more wildfire fuel
to be left on the forest floor, said Sarah Bros, a forester and co-owner
at Merin Forest Management based in North Bay, Ontario, who has done
prescribed burning. "Harvesting doesn't do what Mother Nature
does."]{.underline}

[Budget cuts in the late 1990s, called for by the finance minister at
the time, Paul Martin --- known as a "deficit slayer" --- left few
government agencies untouched, shrinking the Canadian Forest Service's
staff size from **2,200** to the **700** people it now
employs.]{.underline}

"There was an incredible brain drain," said Edward Struzik, a fellow at
the Institute for Energy and Environmental Policy at Queen's University
in Ontario and author of the book "Dark Days at Noon: The Future of
Fire."

"People were mortified, and continue to be mortified, by the fact that
we have this situation that's unfolding, this new fire paradigm, and the
forest service's just getting chump change to address it," he said.

The Wildland Fire Community

In wildland fire management, you really can't go it alone. Facing the
challenges posed by a force of nature that burns across landscapes,
without regard for ownership or administrative boundaries, requires
collaboration. On any wildfire, you\'ll find people wearing yellow
shirts, green pants, high leather boots, and low-slung packs. The
uniformity of their appearance might give the impression that a single
command guides their efforts. In fact, a firefighter may work for any
one of the dozens of federal agencies, Tribes, state institutions,
cities, or private companies that work together to meet the challenges
of one of the most complex and high-risk activities in land management.
Welcome to the wildland fire community.

The core of today\'s wildland fire management \"all hands, all lands\"
approach recognizes the importance of shared priorities on shared
landscapes. The strategy identifies three goals that anchor holistic
wildland fire management across the country:

1.  Restore and maintain landscapes

2.  Create fire-adapted communities

3.  Improve fire response

[Cooperative agreements between members of the wildland fire community
allow us to share resources (including people and equipment) to
efficiently protect people and communities. An Executive Order issued in
December 2018 reaffirmed the federal government's commitment to
collaboration and partnerships at the state and local
level.]{.underline}

Wildland fire will always be with us. It's an element of nature with the
power to restore as well as ruin. [After spending a **century** fighting
fire, even trying to stamp it out entirely, we now work to build
**resilience** to it. Partnerships hold the key to long-term wildland
fire management that protects people, their property, and the natural
and cultural resources we all enjoy.]{.underline}

Federal Partners

One of the primary wildland fire partnerships is between the two
Cabinet-level departments that manage wildland fire on behalf of the
federal government. [The U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S.
Department of the Interior collaborate on planning, policy, response,
technology, and many other aspects of wildland fire management. Within
the Department of the Interior, several offices support wildland fire
management, including the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Bureau of Land
Management, the National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service.]{.underline}

[Within the Department of the Interior, several offices support wildland
fire management work, including the Office of Wildland Fire, the Office
of Aviation Services, and the Office of Policy Analysis.]{.underline}

[A handful of other government agencies play specific roles in the
wildland fire community, like the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
the U.S. Fire Administration, the Natural Resources Conservation
Service, the Department of Defense, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the
National Weather Service.]{.underline}

Non-Federal Partners

[Many organizations facilitate collaboration with local governments,
state agencies, Tribal entities, and other stakeholders in the wildland
fire community, including:]{.underline}

- [International Association of Fire Chiefs]{.underline}

- [Intertribal Timber Council\*]{.underline}

- [National Association of State Foresters]{.underline}

- [The Nature Conservancy]{.underline}

\* Lands managed by the Department of the Interior share 23,900 miles of
border with Native American and Alaska Native lands. Their proximity and
interconnectedness necessitates collaboration in order to protect Tribal
communities, economies, sacred landscapes, and traditional uses of
natural resources from wildfires. On June 15, 2021, the U.S. Department
of the Interior signed a memorandum of understanding with the
Intertribal Timber Council to improve collaboration on wildland fire
management across department and Tribal lands.

International Partners

Since the threat of wildfires extends beyond our borders, the wildland
fire community reaches beyond them as well. [We exchange wildland fire
knowledge, expertise, equipment, and personnel through international
agreements with **Australia, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand,** and
**Portugal**. Australia and New Zealand have sent fire suppression
personnel to the United States six times]{.underline} since 2000, most
recently in 2018, and [Australia sent an airtanker to assist the U.S. in
2022. We've sent fire suppression personnel to Australia six times since
2003 -- most recently in 2019 and 2020. We share personnel and equipment
with Canada virtually **every year**. In 2020, 100 firefighters from
Mexico mobilized to assist firefighting efforts in the Western United
States.]{.underline}

Coordinating Groups

[Many interagency groups and partnerships support coordination and
collaboration around specific issues:]{.underline}

- [**Joint Fire Science Program**: provides leadership, funding, and
  peer review of scientific research about wildland fire.]{.underline}

- [**National Interagency Fire Center**: coordinates the deployment of
  resources to wildland fires and other emergencies throughout the
  country.]{.underline}

- [**National Wildfire Coordinating Group**: establishes standards (like
  position qualifications) so that wildfire management can function
  across organizational boundaries.]{.underline}

- [**Wildland Fire Information Technology Program**: coordinates
  technology development that supports wildland fire.]{.underline}

- [**Wildland Fire Leadership Council**: promotes effective and
  consistent implementation of wildland fire policies and goals
  throughout the wildland fire community.]{.underline}

#### US leadership is key\-\--we're already leading global cooperation.

[This week marks the **historic** inaugural session of the World Fire
Congress (WFC) in Washington D.C., an initiative spearheaded by U.S.
Fire Administrator Dr. Lori Moore-Merrell]{.underline}. Designed to
address the myriad challenges faced by fire services globally, the [WFC
brings together representatives from **over 50 countries** to foster
**international collaboration** and share solutions to critical issues
like wildfire management, firefighter health, and emerging energy
technologies.]{.underline}

Dr. Moore-Merrell emphasized the significance of the gathering: "[The
inaugural session of the WFC meets against the backdrop of complex,
interlocking issues facing fire services, including structure fire,
wildfire, and climate change, emerging energy technology, and
firefighter health and safety." Her leadership has been **pivotal** in
conceptualizing and launching this biannual event that will rotate host
countries, **ensuring** a **continuous and evolving dialogue** among the
world's fire services.]{.underline}

Attendees of the WFC are set to establish a pathway for future meetings,
with the next Congress scheduled for the United Kingdom in 2026. This
ongoing work aims to ensure that the interests and voices of first
responders globally are heard and addressed in perpetuity.

During the event, [fire officials are tackling pressing concerns such as
the rising scale and frequency of wildfires, as highlighted by FEMA
Administrator Deanne Criswell. "I was just talking with some of my
colleagues in Europe and we are hearing about fires in Germany and
Greece at a scale that they have never seen them before," Criswell
noted, underscoring the growing significance of these threats even in
countries unaccustomed to such disasters.]{.underline}

[The Congress also delves into the challenges posed by new technologies,
particularly the risks associated with lithium-ion batteries. District
of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services Chief John Donnelly
expressed the urgency of adapting to these new risks safely: "There are
things like emerging technologies, and how do we implement them to be
safe and to be safe in our community?"]{.underline}

The broad scope of challenges discussed at the WFC reflects the diverse
responsibilities of firefighters today, who are called upon to respond
to a variety of disasters beyond fires, including earthquakes, floods,
severe weather, and volcanic eruptions. [This wide-ranging
responsibility underscores the need for a global dialogue to enhance the
capabilities and safety of firefighters worldwide.]{.underline}

[The establishment of the World Fire Congress under the guidance of Dr.
Lori Moore-Merrell marks a significant step forward in international
firefighting collaboration, promising to enhance strategies and
technologies to better protect communities and first responders across
the globe.]{.underline}

#### Trump is a [sovereign decisionist]{.underline}. He [hates]{.underline} being tread on.

**Gardels 25** \[Nathan Gardels, editor-in-chief of Noema Magazine,
co-founder of and a senior adviser to the Berggruen Institute, holds
degrees in Theory and Comparative Politics and in Architecture and Urban
Planning from UCLA. ; "Trump As Sovereign Decisionist," Noema, 2/14/25;
https://www.noemamag.com/trump-as-sovereign-decisionist/\]//EG

[As President Donald Trump unfolds his agenda, two theories of strong
governance]{.underline} from the pre-liberal world order [**fit his
instincts** like a glove.]{.underline}

In justifying his barrage of rapid-fire executive orders and tariff
proclamations as an urgent response to a "national emergency," [the
hyper-active commander-in-chief brings to mind the Weimar-era
"decisionist" theory of conservative legal scholar Carl
Schmitt.]{.underline}

Writing amid the "cosmopolitan decadence," flailing chaos and
parliamentary paralysis of inter-war Germany, Schmitt argued that
[politics is fundamentally about "**friends versus enemies**." In this
view, absolute sovereign authority derives from the decision to suspend
normal constitutional rule in a "state of exception" where enemies,
within or without, threaten the nation. Whatever action is taken to
address the danger and establish order by the person or group comprising
the sovereign is a priori regarded as legitimate.]{.underline}

This [conception of politics and authority is closely connected to the
"sovereigntist" worldview in global affairs.]{.underline}

[Sovereigntism, simply put, is a **my-country-first**, "**don't tread on
me**" approach to international and planetary relations that abjures any
entanglement in the rules or norms of others that might constrain the
absolute autonomy of a state to act unilaterally in its own
interests.]{.underline}

As Rutgers historian Jennifer Mittelstadt has noted, [sovereigntism is
not isolationism, though it has a long history in America of opposing
any internationally sanctioned authority,]{.underline} from Woodrow
Wilson's League of Nations to the United Nations, the World Trade
Organization, the International Criminal Court or binding alliances and
treaties.

Rather, [it favors building up robust military prowess to ward off any
challengers and is not shy about coveting the territory of others if
incorporating those frontiers would manifest its destiny as a singular
"exception" on the world stage.]{.underline}

[The president's **aggressive musings** about annexing **Greenland**,
the **Panama Canal** and even **Canada fit within this
context.**]{.underline}
