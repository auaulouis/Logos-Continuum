[[Whether a]{.underline}]{.mark} conviction under this [[statute

**[[all]{.underline}]{.mark}** ([as opposed to **any**]{.underline}) of
the chemicals or equipment necessary to manufacture \[\*\*24\]

P.S.C., 207 F.3d 335, 338-39 (6th Cir. 2000) HN9 (\"The starting point
in a statutory interpretation case is the language of the statute
itself.\"). Obviously, the multiple manufacturing methods and the
availability of a broad range of readily available chemicals and
equipment necessary for each manufacturing process militates against
itemizing within the statute all of the possible chemical and equipment
combinations by which methamphetamine could be manufactured.
Nevertheless, KRS 218A.1432(1)(b) does not read \"\[p\]ossesses
chemicals or equipment,\" or \"\[p\]ossesses some of the chemicals or
equipment,\" or \"\[p\]ossesses any of the chemicals or equipment.\" It
reads \"\[p\]ossesses the chemicals or equipment for the manufacture of
methamphetamine.\" [The presence of [the article \"**the**\" is

That fact does not distinguish Goodyear. A generic term may suggest that
it is associated with a specific entity. That does not render it
nongeneric. For example, "Wine, Inc." implies the existence of a
specific legal entity incorporated under the laws of some State.

specific company rather than a genus of companies. But [the [addition of

### USFG\-\--Singular Whole\-\--1NC

#### 'United States' is a singular noun referring to the whole.

Dr. James R. **Hurford 94**, General Linguistics Professor at the
University of Edinburgh, Grammar: A Student's Guide, p. 224

Singular

Explanation

[A [**singular** noun]{.mark}]{.underline} or pronoun in a language
[typically [refers to **just one** thing]{.mark}]{.underline} or person,
or to a mass of stuff, [[rather than]{.mark} to [a
**collection**]{.mark} of things]{.underline} or people. Other nouns
which occur in the same grammatical patterns as typical singular nouns
may be classified as grammatically singular.

Examples

Some singular nouns in English are waiter, inability, objection, cat,
frostbite, garlic, refusal, gatepost, liair and region.

The English personal pronouns I, he. she and it are singular.

Contrasts

Singular contrasts with plural. A word cannot simultaneously be both
singular and plural.

Relationships Singular and plural in a language belong to its system of
number. It is common in languages for singular to be the unmarked member
of the system, and for plural nouns to have some special marker, such as
a suffix; this is true of English, where, for instance, the noun dog is
singular, and its plural is formed by adding an \~s. The singular is
rarely formed by adding something in this way.

The basic parts of speech to which singular applies are nouns and
pronouns; other parts of speech or word-classes may be marked as
singular by agreement with a singular noun or pronoun. In English, only
verbs and demonstratives show this agreement; this and that are singular
demonstratives, and is and was are forms of the verb be which show
singular agreement.

Among the nouns, mass nouns are always singular. So we may say *This
stuff is sticky* and *That wine tastes of bananas*. Count nouns show the
distinction between singular and plural. Thus we have singular/plural
pairs such as *tree/trees*, *diagram/diagrams* and *burial/burials*.
Proper names are almost always singular. [Even proper names formed from
plural common nouns, **such as *[the United States]{.mark}***[, tend to
be singular]{.mark}]{.underline}, as in *The United States is ready to
defend its vital interests*.

### USFG\-\--Singular Whole\-\--2NC

#### 'United States' isn't one branch.

University. Summer 1986. "Congress, the Constitution, and First Use of
Nuclear Weapons." Review of Politics. Vol. 48, No. 3.

Three other points merit mention in this discussion of collective
decision-making. First, both the formal and the secret constitutions
allocate power over foreign relations and defense to the central
government, to, that is, the United States of America visualized as a
single entity. [What]{.underline}, however, [is \"the\"
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates[?]{.underline} The question has
never been definitively answered; and indeed has seldom been asked in
judicial opinion or scholarly discourse.42 Asked another way, the
question is this: Where does sovereignty lie in the American polity? The
formal constitution is supposedly based on popular sovereignty, with
ultimate power resting in the people. That, however, is far from
accurate. Proof positive that sovereignty lies in the \"state\" came
when General Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox: \"the people\" of
the South were not to be permitted to exercise their \"sovereignty.\"
The powers of the national government are supposedly only those
delegated to it, either expressly or impliedly. But that is scarcely
accurate, as 200 years of constitutional development attest. The Framers
of the formal constitution established a governmental system that, as
Justice Robert Jackson commented, would ensure that the dispersed powers
of the federal government would be integrated into a workable
government. \"Separateness but interdependence, autonomy but
reciprocity\" was the constitutional command.43 [The meaning is
unmistakable: [\"the\" U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[is a **single**]{.mark}]{.underline}
metaphysical [[**entity**, encompassing]{.underline}]{.mark} state,
society, and [[government in one]{.mark} artificial
[being]{.mark}]{.underline}. These terms are not synonymous. The state
is the fundamental entity; government its apparatus; and society is
composed of the individuals and groups governed. Much like the business
corporation, the state-\"the\" United States-is an artificial construct,
more a method than a thing. It exists in constitutional theory-in, for
example, the state secrets privilege in litigation-even though judges
and commentators alike often confuse the term with government and with
society. A legal fiction that by itself can do no act, speak no work,
and think no thought, the state (like the corporation) has \"no
anatomical parts to be kicked or consigned to the calaboose; no soul for
whose salvation the parson may struggle; no body to be roasted in hell
or purged for celestial enjoyment.\" 44 [Despite loose language to the
contrary]{.underline} from executive branch lawyers and even the Supreme
Court, \"the\" state or [\"the\" government-or \"the\"
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates-[is **[not to be equated
with]{.mark}**]{.underline} the executive branch. Nor with
**[[any]{.mark} one [branch]{.mark}]{.underline}**, for that matter;
[[each branch is part of an **indivisible** whole]{.underline}]{.mark}.

**'Government' is a [collective]{.underline} noun, meaning the
[whole]{.underline} body**

Dr. Loreto **Todd 5**, Professor and Reader in International English at
the University of Leeds & Author of More Than 20 Books on Linguistics &
English Usage, International English Usage, Ed. Hancock and Todd, p. 133

[The]{.underline} term [[***collective noun*** refers to a **singular
noun**]{.mark} that has a plural implication (e.g. \[for example,\]
***government***) [and is used when the **whole body**]{.mark} **(and
[not]{.mark} the constituent [members]{.mark})** [is]{.mark} being
[considered]{.mark}]{.underline}. The category *collective nouns* is not
discrete, and it can be argued that some usages are midway between
collective and mass nouns. For example, *team* is clearly a collective
noun and *butter* is clearly a mass noun but it is not so easy to decide
the status of such nouns as: hair linen royalty.

[As regards **the mandatory character** of the rule, the word "should"
is **not only an auxiliary verb**, it is also **the preterite of the
verb, "shall,"** and has]{.underline} for one of [its
meanings]{.underline}, as defined in the Century Dictionary: ["Obliged
or compelled (to); would have (to); must; ought (to); used with an

**necessity** or **duty** in connection with some act **yet to be

sense]{.underline} that [the word "should" is used]{.underline} in this
rule, [not **merely advisory**]{.underline}. When the judge in charging
a jury tells them that, unless they find from all the evidence, beyond a
reasonable doubt, that the defendant is guilty of the offense charged,
they should acquit, [the word "should" is **not used** in **an advisory

something in direct violation of law must not be so indulged as to
fritter away, or nullify, provisions which have been enacted to
safeguard and protect the welfare of thousands who are engaged in the
hazardous occupation of mining.

### Should\-\--Certain\-\--2NC

#### 'Should' is obligatory, [NOT]{.underline} advisory.

**Riddle '14** \[Finis E; December 22; Justice on the Supreme Court of
Oklahoma; Westlaw, "St. Louis & S. F. R. Co. v. Brown," 45 Okla. 143\]

[The]{.underline} specific grounds of [objection]{.underline} are that
the court should have used the word "shall" instead of "should," that
[the word "should" is **merely advisory**]{.underline}, and that the
jury was left at its discretion in the matter of reduction of the
damages. It has been said that [the word "should" is **the past tense**
of the word "shall,"]{.underline} and we think, in the connection in
which it was used, the jury understood that it meant **[more than simply
advisory]{.underline}**.

In the case of Smith v. State, 142 Ind. 288, 41 N. E. 595, the Supreme
Court of Indiana held that [it was **more imperative** than the word
"may."]{.underline}

In the case of Lynch v. Bates, 139 Ind. 206, 38 N. E. 806, where the
court charged the jury that in passing upon the weight of the evidence,
etc., they "should" take into consideration \*1081 the interest of the
witness, etc., the court reversed the case, holding that [the word
"should"]{.underline} there [was]{.underline} too
**[imperative]{.underline}**.

In the case of Durand\'s Adm\'r v. N. Y. & L. B. R. Co., 65 N. J. Law,
656, 48 Atl. 1013, the court held that [the word "should"
implies]{.underline} the performance of some **[obligation or
duty]{.underline}**. Often the word "shall" is used to mean "may." So,
it will be seen that either of the terms cannot be considered
abstractly, but must be considered in connection with the subject-matter
and sense in which it is used.

#### 'Should' means 'must.'

**Stroud '2k** \[John F Jr; July 7; Judge on the Court of Appeals of
Arkansas; Westlaw, "Guest v. San Pedro," 70 Ark. App. 389\]

[The interpretation]{.underline} of this section, which appears to be a
question of first impression, [turns upon **the meaning** of the word
"**should**"]{.underline} in the phrase "\[a\]ny partial abatement or
reduction of child support should not exceed 50% of the child-support
obligation during the extended visitation period." In Little v. State,
261 Ark. 859, 554 S.W.2d 312 (1977), the supreme court ruled that the
trial court, giving an instruction on circumstantial evidence, had not
misled the jury by using the word "should" instead of "must" in stating
that circumstances should point to and be consistent with guilt but
should be inconsistent with any other reasonable hypothesis.
[The]{.underline} Little [court opined]{.underline} that use of the word
"must" would have been preferable to the use of "should," but the court
noted that [the]{.underline} \*396 [words are]{.underline} often
**[synonymous]{.underline}**. 261 Ark. at 884, 554 S.W.2d at 324, citing
Rodale, The Synonym Finder 780 (Special Deluxe Ed.).

Similarly, [we hold]{.underline} that [the word "**should**" is
equivalent to the word "**must**"]{.underline} as used in the phrase
"any partial abatement or reduction of child support should not exceed
50% of the child-support obligation during the extended visitation
period." We hold that the 50% limitation in Administrative Order No. 10
is mandatory: abatement or reduction of child support during an extended
visitation period cannot exceed 50% of the child-support obligation
during the extended visitation period.

### Should\-\--AT: Certain\-\--2AC

#### 'Should' is [advisory]{.underline}, not certain. It also [equals]{.underline} 'ought.'

**Richman '16** \[James; August 17; Judge on the Second Circuit,
California's Court of Appeals; Westlaw, "Marin Assn. of Pub. Emps. v.
Marin Cty. Employees\' Ret. Assn.," 2 Cal. App. 5th 674\]

There is, of course, no bar to the Supreme Court adopting a Court of
Appeal\'s reasoning as its own. Yet there is legitimate reason to
question whether that was what the Supreme Court intended in 1983.
First, as just shown, [**only the least authoritative** of the three
sources]{.underline} cited \*\*385 [**actually supports** the word
"must,"]{.underline} while [the]{.underline} two [Supreme Court
decisions employ "**should**."]{.underline} Second, barely a month
later, the Supreme Court---speaking though the same justice---filed
another decision which used the "should" formulation from the 1955 Allen
decision as quoted in Abbott.20 Third, the 1983 Allen decision involved
retirees (and Flournoy the widow of a retiree), who historically receive
a heightened degree of judicial protection. (See fn. 19, ante.) Fourth,
and most significantly, [the "must" formulation has never been
reiterated by the Supreme Court, which has **instead uniformly
employed** the "should"]{.underline} \*699 [language]{.underline} from
the 1955 Allen decision. (Olson v. Cory, supra, 27 Cal.3d 532, 541, 178
Cal.Rptr. 568, 636 P.2d 532 \["Although an employee does not obtain any
'absolute right to fixed or specific benefits \... there \[are\] strict
limitation\[s\] on the conditions which may modify the pension system in
effect during employment.' \[Citation.\] Such modifications must be
reasonable and any ' "changes in a pension plan which result in
disadvantage to employees should be accompanied by comparable new
advantages" ' "\]; Legislature v. Eu (1991) 54 Cal.3d 492, 529--530, 286
Cal.Rptr. 283, 816 P.2d 1309 \[quoting Olson\]; City of Huntington Beach
v. Board of Administration (1992) 4 Cal.4th 462, 472, 14 Cal.Rptr.2d
514, 841 P.2d 1034 \["changes in a pension plan which result in
disadvantage to employees should be accompanied by comparable new
advantages," citing Allen v. City of Long Beach, supra, 45 Cal.2d 128,
131, 287 P.2d 765\].)

It thus appears unlikely that the Supreme Court\'s use of "must" in the
1983 Allen decision was intended to herald a fundamental doctrinal
shift. ["Should," not "must," remains the **court\'s preferred
expression**]{.underline}. And ["should" does not convey **imperative
obligation**, **no more compulsion** than "ought."]{.underline} (Lashley
v. Koerber (1945) 26 Cal.2d 83, 90, 156 P.2d 441; see People v. Webb
(1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 401, 409, fn. 2, 230 Cal.Rptr. 755 \[["the word
'should' is **advisory only**]{.underline} [and not
mandatory"]{.underline}\].) [In **plain effect**, "should" is "**a
recommendation**, not \... **a mandate**."]{.underline} (Cuevas v.
Superior Court (1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 406, 409, 130 Cal.Rptr. 238.)

### Should\-\--AT: Certain\-\--1AR

**White '26** \[Warren L; January 8; Judge on the Springfield Court of
Appeals of Missouri; Westlaw, "Hubbard v. Turner Department Store Co.,"
220 Mo.App. 95\]

3 [The verb ["should"]{.mark} has **various shades of meaning**. In
**its ordinary meaning** it [does not express **certainty** as the word
"will" **sometimes does**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the telegram under
consideration it seems to be used in the sense that, from the
anticipated profits, plaintiff might receive a bonus of \$25 to \$50 per
month. It is nothing more than an expression of opinion, with no
definite assurance that such would be the result. The expression,
"twenty--five to fifty dollars per month extra," adds nothing to the
certainty or definiteness of the proposal but is merely suggestive. The
whole expression, "a part of profits that should mean from twenty--five
to fifty dollars per month extra, to our minds cannot possibly be
construed as guaranty or an unconditional promise to pay a minimum of
\$25 per month or a maximum of \$50 per month out of the profits, in
addition to the agreed salary. It is merely suggestive. Moreover, no
method is provided for determining what the share of plaintiff in the
profits might be; no per cent. is named. Whether net or gross profits or
whether profits from the whole store or only the furniture department,
were to be the basis of settlement, is all left to conjecture. There is
no stipulation as to when settlements were to be made, which, obviously,
might be either weekly, monthly, annually, or whenever the employment
should cease. The expression in the telegram, "if you want to come and
work hard, we will take care of you in good shape," avails plaintiff
nothing from the standpoint of law. The whole telegram is one well
calculated to mislead, whether deliberate or not. Morally, defendant was
under some obligation to increase plaintiff\'s salary in the event the
concern prospered and plaintiff worked hard; but, legally, we are
confronted with an insurmountable obstacle in so far as affording relief
to plaintiff is concerned. It is an elemental and fundamental rule of
law that a contract, to be valid, "must be certain and unequivocal in
its essential terms, either within itself or by reference to some other
agreement or matter." 6 R. C. L. 644; 9 Cyc. 245; 18 R. C. L. 494; Burks

**Superior Court of Alaska '20** \[Alaska Super. Ct. Third Judicial
District, August 12; "Nabors Int\'l v. Dep\'t of Revenue," Case No.
3AN-18-09155CI\]

VI\. The statute is unclear as to how taxpayers must comply with
Subparts (A) and (B) given the missing conjunction between the two
clauses, rendering the statute void in violation of the Due Process
Clause

\"A statute is ambiguous if it can be reasonably interpreted in more
than one way.\"105 A statute containing two alternatives that are
connected by the disjunctive \"or\" generally means \[\*41\] that the
listed alternatives must be treated separately, whereas a statute that
uses the conjunctive \"and\" means that both alternatives must be
met.106 Applying these rules of statutory interpretation to Section
145(a)(5) means that if \"or\" is the missing conjunction between
Subparts (A) and (B), the requirements of either clause, if met, would
require a corporation to include an affiliated group in its Alaska
return. However, if \"and\" is used, the requirements of both clauses
must be met before the corporation is required to include an affiliated
group in the return.

So, under Subpart (A), a corporation doing business in a foreign country
with a tax rate of 90 percent or less than the U.S. tax rate that also
directly or indirectly attributes to one or more members of a group of
corporations filing an Alaska return 50 percent or more of its sales,
purchases, or payments of income or expenses is required to include its
affiliated group income on the group\'s Alaska return. Whereas, Subpart
(B) requires inclusion of an affiliated corporation\'s income in its
unitary Alaska return if it meets the 90 percent tax threshold test and
it does not conduct significant economic activity.

\"Economic activities\" include \[\*42\] making, providing, purchasing,
or selling goods or services, such as producing, distributing and
consuming products or services, and any activities involving money or
the exchange of products or services.107 \"[**Significant**\" is defined
as \"of a **noticeably** or **measurably large**
amount.]{.underline}\"108 Accordingly, the statute means that a
corporation that conducts significant economic activity is one that has
a noticeably or measurably large amount of activities relating to
making, providing, purchasing, or selling goods or services, or any
activities involving money or the exchange of products or services.
Conversely, [a corporation that does not conduct significant economic
activity would not have a noticeably or measurably large amount of these
types of activities.]{.underline}

[The plain meaning of \"significant\" could be argued to
render]{.underline} [Subparts]{.underline} (A) and (B) as
[disjunctive]{.underline}, because it seems unlikely that a corporation
would ever comply with both subparts simultaneously. That is, making 50
percent or more of sales, purchases or payments in a location where an
entity does not conduct significant sales, purchases or payments seems
improbable, unless the combined group \[\*43\] does little or no
business at all. And, as discussed above, Subparts (A) and (B) of
Section 145(a)(5) are nearly identical to Footnote 2 of the Working
Group\'s Common Elements of Water\'s Edge Options Two --- Six.109 In
that part of the Working Group report, the two statements are connected
by a disjunctive \"or.\"110 So, an \"or\" makes the most sense. But [it
is not the only logical reading]{.underline}, as discussed below.

In April 2020 the UK Supreme Court had reason to discuss [the
**difference** between '**significant**' and
'**substantial**']{.underline} in the context of what is a 'significant
reduction in life expectancy'. The court said that '[like the **skin**
of a **chameleon**, the adjective takes a **different colour** so as to
**suit** a **different context'**.]{.underline}

[The word 'significant' often means something **less** than the word
'**substantial'**. But in **context** it can mean
'**substantial'**]{.underline}.

The court gave an example of the reduction of normal life expectancy of
a 74 year-old to two years as not being significant whereas such a
reduction for a 24 year-old would be a significant and therefore
substantial reduction.

These words are often used in legal documents and care must be taken to
use them correctly in the context. [The fact that the **meaning
changes** with **context** may be a reason **not to use** them **at
all** and, if **possible**, be **specific**]{.underline}.

§ 1508.27 Significantly.

\"[Significantly]{.underline}\" as used in NEPA [requires considerations
of]{.underline} both [context]{.underline} and intensity:

\(a\) Context. This means that the significance of an action must be
analyzed in several contexts such as society as a whole (human,
national), the affected region, the affected interests, and the
locality. [Significance **varies with the setting** of the proposed
action]{.underline}. For instance, [in the case of a site-specific
action, significance would usually depend upon the effects in the
**locale**]{.underline} rather than in the world as a whole. Both short-
and long-term effects are relevant.

\(b\) Intensity. This refers to the severity of impact. Responsible
officials must bear in mind that more than one agency may make decisions
about partial aspects of a major action.

In determining the plain meaning of the phrase "increases the obligor\'s
insolvency," the Court initially notes that this phrase makes no
reference whatsoever to a "reasonably equivalent value" test26 or even
to the "fair consideration" test of the Section 3 of the UFCA.27
Instead, Article 2036 of the Civil Code merely uses the word
"increases," and the absence of "reasonably equivalent value" language
or "fair consideration" language rings loudly in the Court\'s judicial
ear. Accordingly, [the Court will focus on **the plain meaning** of the
term "**increases**." Taking note from **one of the dictionaries of
choice** of the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates **[Supreme
Court]{.underline}**,28 [the Court finds that the definition of the word
"**increase**" in Webster\'s]{.underline} Ninth New Collegiate
Dictionary [reads as **follows**:]{.underline}

\*270 \[T\]o become progressively greater (as in size, amount, number,
or intensity) \.... [to make **greater**]{.underline}: AUGMENT \....
INCREASE, ENLARGE, AUGMENT, MULTIPLY mean to make or become greater.
INCREASE used intransitively implies progressive growth in size, amount,
intensity; [**used transitively** it may imply **simple not necessarily
progressive addition**]{.underline} \... the act or process of
increasing: [as]{.underline} \... [**addition or enlargement**
in]{.underline} size, **[extent]{.underline}**, quantity.

Specifically, EPA claims that, even when a change causes emissions to
rise to the highest level reached in the past ten years, it does not
"increase\[\]" them. EPA Br. 69-71, 86. According to EPA\'s untenable
argument, Congress did not specify how an increase is to be measured,
and thus left EPA free to interpret "increases" as it wishes. Id.

**McGuffey '20** \[Carroll; Summer; partner at Troutman Pepper Hamilton
Sanders LLP; Natural Resources & Environment, "Reforming New Source
Review: What Project Emissions Accounting Really Means, and Why It
Should Survive," p. 37\]

The debate over how to count changes in emissions when determining NSR
applicability is as old as the program itself. [The CAA]{.underline}
requires permitting for any "increase" in emissions, 42 U.S.C. §§ 7411,
7475, 7479, but it [does not define the word "**increase**," leaving
room for interpretation. Such ambiguity leaves **EPA** in charge of
deciding how]{.underline} sources must determine whether [an
"**increase**" will occur]{.underline}. New York, 413 F.3d at 22-24. In
fact, a different dispute over the ambiguities in the very same
statutory provision resulted in the Supreme Court\'s now famous (or
infamous) Chevron decision on agency deference. Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v.
Natural Res. Def. Council, 467 U.S. 837, 865 (1984) (concluding that the
EPA\'s method of calculating emissions is a reasonable policy choice).

In an attempt [to define]{.underline} the ambiguous word ["increase,"
EPA]{.underline} has adopted increasingly complex
[regulations]{.underline}, but those rules have consistently maintained
that source owners [must]{.underline} be allowed to [consider
the]{.underline} overall ["**net effect**"]{.underline} of a project [on
the]{.underline} stationary source as a **[whole]{.underline}**. This
idea has taken on many names and forms over time\--referred to variously
as the "bubble concept," "contemporaneous netting," "project netting,"
and now "Project Emissions Accounting." The only debate has been in
deciding what rules are needed to right-size the NSR permitting program
so that permits are required only for those projects that truly warrant
such review.

No one can predict with any certainty how the D.C. Circuit will receive
PEA. However, the D.C. Circuit already decided long ago that the CAA
allows EPA significant discretion in deciding how sources should
calculate emissions increases and decreases in applying NSR permitting
requirements.

The issue of whether and how to count multiple changes in emissions
under NSR arose in the context of legal challenges to EPA\'s 1978 NSR
rules. Alabama Power Co. v. Costle, 636 F.2d 323, 399-403 (D.C. Cir.
1980). In that lengthy opinion, specifically the portion authored by
[Judge Wilkey]{.underline}, the court [recognized]{.underline} that
[there were]{.underline} two [**logical ways** to interpret the word
"**increase**" in the statute]{.underline}\--a source must either
determine the "net effect" or count only increases and ignore decreases.

[The court **resoundingly rejected** the idea that decreases should be
**ignored**]{.underline}, calling the idea "unreasonable and contrary to
the expressed purposes of the \[Act\]." Instead, the court decided that
the statute requires EPA to "look at any change proposed for a plant,
and decide whether the net effect of all the steps involved in that
change is to increase the emission of any air pollutant \[;\] this is
commonly termed the 'bubble' concept." Id. at 401 (emphasis added). To
explain its reasoning, the court noted that "\[t\]he bubble concept is
precisely suited to preserve air quality within a framework that allows
cost-efficient, flexible planning for industrial expansion and
improvement." Id. at 402.

### Increase\-\--Preexistence\-\--1NC

#### To "increase" means expanding [already-existing cooperation]{.underline}.

**Buckley '6** \[Jeremiah S, Joseph M. Kolar; November 13; partners at
Buckley Kolar LLP; Westlaw, Brief of Amici Curiae for "Mortgage
Insurance Companies of America and Consumer Mortgage Coalition," WL
3309503\]

First, [t]{.underline}he court said that the ordinary meaning of the
word "increase" is "to make something greater," which it believed should
not "be limited to cases in which a company raises the rate that an
individual has previously been charged." 435 F.3d at 1091. Yet [**the
definition** offered by the Ninth Circuit compels **the opposite
conclusion**. Because "increase" means "to make **something greater**,"
there must necessarily have been **an existing**]{.underline} premium,
[to]{.underline} which Edo\'s actual premium may [**be compared**, to
determine whether an]{.underline} \*26 ["increase" **occurred**.
Congress]{.underline} could have provided that "adverse action" in the
insurance context means charging an amount greater than the optimal
premium, but instead **[chose]{.underline}** to define adverse action in
terms of an ["increase." That definitional choice must be **respected,
not ignored**]{.underline}. See Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379,
392-93 n.10 (1979) ("\[a\] definition which declares what a term
'means\' ... excludes any meaning that is not stated").

Next, the Ninth Circuit reasoned that because the Insurance Prong
includes the words "existing or applied for," Congress intended that an
"increase in any charge" for insurance must "apply to all insurance
transactions - from an initial policy of insurance to a renewal of a
long-held policy." 435 F.3d at 1091. This interpretation reads the words
"existing or applied for" in isolation. Other types of adverse action
described in the Insurance Prong apply only to situations where a
consumer had an existing policy of insurance, such as a "cancellation,"
"reduction," or "change" in insurance. [Each]{.underline} of these forms
of adverse action [**presupposes an already-existing policy**, and under
**usual canons of statutory construction** the term "increase" also
should be **construed** to apply to **increases** of **an
already-existing policy**]{.underline}. See Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U.S. 88,
101 (2004) ("a phrase gathers meaning from the words around it")
(citation omitted).

### Increase\-\--Preexistence\-\--2NC

#### [Plain language]{.underline} agrees.

**Brown '3** \[Anna J; July 17; Federal District Court Judge in Oregon;
Westlaw, Mark v. Valley Insurance Company, 275 F. Supp. 2d 1307\]

[FCRA does not **define** the term "increase." **The plain and ordinary
meaning** of **the verb** "to increase" is to make]{.underline}
something **[greater or larger]{.underline}**.4 [Merriam--Webster\'s
Collegiate Dictionary]{.underline} 589 (10th ed.1998). The "something"
that is increased in the statute is the "charge for any insurance." The
plain and common meaning of the noun "charge" is "the price demanded for
something." Id. at 192. Thus, the statute plainly means an insurer takes
adverse action if the insurer makes greater (i.e., larger) the price
demanded for insurance.

[An insurer cannot "**make greater**" something that did not **exist
previously**]{.underline}. The statutory definition of adverse action,
therefore, clearly anticipates an insurer must have made an initial
charge or demand for payment before the insurer can increase that
charge. In other words, an insurer cannot increase the charge for
insurance unless the insurer previously set and demanded payment of the
premium for that insured\'s insurance coverage at a lower price.

The NCLAT took note of the observations of the Adjudicating Authority in
the order under challenge wherein the provision relating to moratorium
under section 14 was discussed and clarified as to which property is to
be attached while passing order for initiation of moratorium. The
relevant portion of the Order of the Adjudicating Authority is
reproduced hereunder:

\"8.1. On careful reading I have noticed that [the term \"its\" is
significant]{.underline}. The plain language of the Section is that on
the commencement of the Insolvency process [the \'Moratorium\' shall be
declared for]{.underline} prohibiting any action to recover or enforce
[any security interest created by the Corporate Debtor in respect of
\"its\" property.]{.underline} Relevant section which needs in-depth
examination is Section 14 (1) (c) of The Code. There are recognized
canons of interpretation. [Language of the Statute should be read as it
existed.]{.underline} This is a trite law that [no word can be added or
substituted or deleted]{.underline} from the enacted Code duly
legislated. Every word is to be read and interpreted as it exists in the
statute with the natural meaning attached to the word. Rather in this
Section the language is so simple that there is no scope even to supply
casus omissus I hasten to add that the doctrine of Noscitura Sociis\' is
somewhat applicable that the associated words take their meaning from
one another so that common sense meaning coupled together in their
cognate sense be interpreted. As a result, \"[[its\" denotes the
property owned by the]{.mark} Corporate [Debtor]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[The [property **not owned** by the]{.mark} Corporate [Debtor]{.mark}
**[do not fall within the ambits]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the
Moratorium. Even Section 10 is confined to the Book of the Accounts of
the Corporate Debtor, due to the reason that Section 10(3) has specified
that the Corporate Applicant shall furnish \"its\" Books of Accounts.
[This Bench has no legislative authority to expand the meaning of the
term \"its\"]{.underline} even under the umbrella of \'ejusdem

**Singh Associates '17** \[Singh Associates; September 1; Indian law
firm; Mondaq, "India: Liability Of The Promoter With Regards To The
Personal Property Given As Security When The Moratorium Has Been Issued"
Mondaq Business Briefing, Nexis Uni\]

Recently in the case of Schweitzer Systemtek vs. Phoenix ARC Limited3,
the Mumbai bench of the NCLT was asked to adjudicate on the issue that
whether the personal properties of the promoters which have been given
as security to the bank/creditor come under the purview of the
moratorium as envisaged under Section 14 of the Code or not. In this
case, Dhanlaxmi Bank had lent Rs 4.5 crore to the company wherein the
promoter had pledged personal properties. The bank sold the loan along
with security to Phoenix ARC. M/s Schweitzer Systemtek had filed for the
initiation of CIRP under Section 10 (3) which was opposed by Phoenix ARC
fearing that if the case is admitted, a moratorium under Section 14 of
the Code will be issued, which could thwart the action taken so far for
recovery of the outstanding loans which included selling personal
properties of the promoters which were in an advanced stage.

The Tribunal perused the facts and came to the conclusion that the
admitted position of the debtor is that the personal properties have
been given as a \"Security\" to the banks which clearly implies that the
properties are currently not under the ownership of the Corporate
Debtor. In that regard, to ascertain that whether the properties which
are not owned by a Corporate Debtor will come within the ambits of the
Moratorium or not, the Tribunal examined Section 14 (c) of the Code and
observed that the canon of interpretation is a very important tool for
gauging the intention of the legislature and language of the Statute is
such that no word can be added, or substituted or deleted from the
enacted Code, thereby [the term \"its\"]{.underline} in the
aforementioned section becomes very important because on a plain reading
of the section it is understood that on the commencement of the
Insolvency Process, the Moratorium shall be declared for prohibiting any
action to recover or enforce any security interest created by the
Corporate Debtor in respect of its property, the [usage of the word
[\"its\"]{.mark} clearly [makes a distinction between the property owned
by the]{.mark} Corporate [Debtor and **other** properties]{.mark},
[which means that the Moratorium will have **no application on the
properties beyond the ownership** of the]{.mark} Corporate
[Debtor]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this case, since the property in
question was given as security to the bank, the moratorium would not
apply on the personal properties.

In this case, NCLT, has interpreted Section 14(1)(c) in its literal
sense. It was held that the term [[\'its\' refers to the property of
the]{.mark} corporate [debtor]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Therefore,
the [[property **not owned**]{.mark} by the corporate debtor [would not
fall under the ambit]{.mark}]{.underline} of moratorium. NCLAT vide its
order dated July 31, 2017, has also upheld the decision of NCLT that
moratorium would not be applicable to any assets, movable or immovable,
that does not belong to the corporate debtor.

Judgment dated July 3, 2018 passed by NCLT Mumbai Bench (T.C.P. No.
1059/I&BP/NCLT/MB/MAH/2017) and Judgment dated August 9, 2017 \[Company

of Schweitzer Systemtek India Private Limited vs. Phoenix ARC Private
Limited & Ors.

The issue \'whether the personal property of the guarantors that was
given as security would fall under the purview of moratorium declared
under Section 14 of IBC\' was also discussed in the aforesaid matter.

NCLT inter alia held that \"\.....the Moratorium shall prohibit the
action against the properties reflected in the Balance Sheet of the

On its face, the written instrument granting easement rights in this
case is ambiguous. The same sentence which refers to the right to lay a

only previous reference has been to a \"line\" (singular). [The [writing

preceding the \"sentence\" which does not begin with a capital letter,
there appears a dangling  \[\*236\]  semicolon which makes no sense at

AT&T also argues that Merger Commitment 7.4 only permits extension of
"any given" interconnection agreement for a single three year term. AT&T
Brief at 12. Specifically, AT&T asserts that because Cricket adopted the
interconnection agreement between Sprint and AT&T, which itself was
extended, Cricket is precluded from extending the term of its agreement
with AT&T. Id This argument relies upon an inaccurate assumption: that
the agreement (contract) between Sprint and AT&T, and the agreement
(contract) between Cricket and AT&T, are one and the same. In other
words, to accept AT&T's argument the Commission must conclude that two
separate contracts, i.e. the interconnection between Sprint and AT&T in
Kentucky ("Sprint Kentucky Agreement") and the interconnection between
Cricket and AT&T in Kentucky ("Cricket Kentucky Agreement"), are one and
the same. Upon this unstated (and inaccurate) premise AT&T asserts that
"***the ICA*** was already extended"; id. at 14, and "***the ICA***
Cricket seeks to extend was extended by Sprint . . . ."; id. at 15, and,
finally, "Cricket cannot extend ***the same ICA*** a second time . . .
." Id. (emphasis added in all). Note that in the quoted portions of the
AT&T brief (and elsewhere) [AT&T uses vague and imprecise
language]{.underline} when referring to either the Sprint Kentucky
Agreement, or the Cricket Kentucky Agreement, i[n hopes that the
Commission will treat the two contracts as]{.underline} one and [the
same]{.underline}. But it would be a mistake to do so. The contract
governing AT&T's duties and obligations with Sprint is a legally
distinct and separate contract from that which governs AT&T's duties
with Cricket. The Sprint Kentucky Agreement was approved by the
Commission in September of 2001 in Case Number 2000-00480. The Cricket
Kentucky Agreement was approved by the Commission in September of 2008
in Case Number 2008-033 1. [AT&T ignores]{.underline} the fact [that
these are two separate and distinct contracts because it knows that the
merger commitments apply to ***each*** agreement]{.underline} that an
individual telecommunications carrier has with AT&T. Notably, Merger
Commitment 7.4 states that "AT&T/BellSouth ILECs shall permit ***a
requesting telecommunications carrier*** to extend ***its*** current
interconnection agreement . . . . As written, [the commitment allows any
carrier to extend "***its***" agreement]{.underline}. Clearly, the use
of the pronoun ["[its]{.mark}"]{.underline} in this context [[is
possessive]{.underline}]{.mark}, such that [the term "its" [means -
***that*** particular]{.mark} carrier's [agreement]{.mark}]{.underline}
with AT&T **[([and not any]{.mark} other carrier's
[agreement]{.mark}]{.underline}**). Thus, the merger commitment applies
to each agreement that an individual carrier may have with AT&T. It
necessarily follows then, that Cricket's right to extend its agreement
under Merger Commitment 7.4 is separate and distinct right from another
carrier's right to extend its agreement with AT&T (or whether such
agreement has been extended).

In support of this contention appellant again argues that when any
ambiguity exists in a will it is the duty of the court to construe the
will under guidance of the presumption that the testatrix intended her
property to go to her next of kin, unless there is a strong intention to
the contrary. Again we say, there is intrinsic proof of a  \[\*1074\] 
strong intention to the contrary. In the first place, testatrix only
named two of her blood relatives in the will and had she
desired \[\*\*\*37\]  them to take the residuary estate she doubtless
would have mentioned them by name in the residuary clause. In the second
place, if she used the word \"heirs\" in the sense of blood relatives
she certainly would have dispelled all ambiguity by stating whose blood
relatives were intended. Not only had  \[\*\*53\]  she taken pains in
the will to identify her own two blood relatives but she had also
identified certain blood relatives of her deceased husband. [[Had it
been her intention to vest the residuary estate in her blood relatives
**solely**]{.mark}, she [would certainly]{.mark} have [use]{.mark}d the
**[possessive pronoun]{.mark}** \"my\" instead of the indefinite article
\"the\"]{.underline} in the clause, \"the above heirs.\"its is

On its face, the written instrument granting easement rights in this
case is ambiguous. The same sentence which refers to the right to lay a
14 inch pipeline (singular) has a later reference to \"said lines\"
(plural). The use of the plural \"lines\" makes no sense because the
only previous reference has been to a \"line\" (singular). [The writing
is]{.underline} additionally [ambiguous because]{.underline} other key
words which are \"also may change the size of its pipes\" are dangling
in that [the possessive [pronoun \"its]{.mark}\"]{.underline} before the
word \"pipes\" [[does not have any subject preceding]{.mark}, to which
the possessive pronoun refers]{.underline}. The dangling phrase is the
beginning of a sentence, the first word of which does not begin with a
capital letter as is customary in normal English \[\*\*\*10\]  usage.
Immediately preceding the \"sentence\" which does not begin with a
capital letter, there appears a dangling  \[\*236\]  semicolon which
makes no sense at the beginning of a sentence and can hardly relate to
the preceding sentence which is already properly punctuated by a closing
period. [The above deviations from accepted grammatical usage
**[make]{.mark} difficult, if not [impossible, a clear

**Frederiksen '23** \[Mads; March 13; Executive Director of the Arctic
Economic Council; Arctic Economic Council, "If we want an energy
transition, we must have more mining,"
https://arcticeconomiccouncil.com/news/if-we-want-an-energy-transition-we-must-have-more-mining\]

As we can see, [we [must diversify our **raw materials**]{.mark}
[supply]{.mark} and develop mining]{.underline} [operations in **new
places**, instead of outsourcing to developing countries. [**The Arctic
region** contains **many**]{.mark} of the **[minerals]{.mark}** that are
[currently mined elsewhere]{.mark}, even though [the]{.mark}
[**quality** of the **ore**]{.mark} [could **possibly be better in the
north.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

We cannot get anywhere close to the quantity of required raw materials
in a sustainable manner unless developed countries are also pursuing
mining opportunities.

The good news is that there is growing consumer demand for more supply
chain transparency, tighter environmental regulations, and labour
rights. This, combined with the strategic importance, may lead to more
mining in the Arctic. The first obstacle to overcome is the idea of
"NIMBY -- not in my backyard" or "Green colonialism" which some interest
groups are promoting. Some of the interest groups don't even live in the
front yard of the Arctic but believe that the region should be kept
separate from wider global development.

[I believe that when presented with the options of where and how
[mining]{.mark} takes place today, and how it [**could take place** in
the **Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline}, this information could bring more
people together. Local communities ultimately benefit from having a mine
close-by. They create new jobs and the supply and demand for supporting
services. In some parts of the Arctic, it is the mining companies that
construct and develop the infrastructure to improve the lives in the
north. For example, through investment in schools and renewable energy.

It was the demand for metal that drove industrialization from
approximately 1700 to 1900, followed by the demand of new infrastructure
and two world wars which led to the development of modern materials.
Subsequently, the growth of big science and high-tech, combined with the
rise of China from early 2000 has resulted in not only an exponential
increase in energy demand but also in the demand for minerals.

The production of copper, zinc and steel has escalated drastically in
the past 50 years. By 2030, the 20 million project EV charging points,
that are anticipated globally, will consume 250% more copper than
produced today. Wood Mackenzie estimated in 2022 that 9.7 million tonnes
(Mt) of new copper supply is needed over 10 years from projects yet to
be sanctioned, equivalent to nearly a third of current refined
consumption, if industry is to meet the Paris Climate Agreement targets.
They also estimate that more than US\$23 billion a year will be called
for over 30 years, to deliver new projects under an accelerated energy
transition scenario.

According to World Bank study from 2017, [we need to increase our
production of nickel by 100%, indium by **more than 200%**, and
**cobalt**, **lithium** and **graphite** by more than 450% no later than
2050 in order to reach our climate targets.]{.underline}

The challenge is now that we have mined our way through history, so the
quality -- or the grade -- of the minerals is getting worse at the
surface. We must dig deeper to retrieve useful material. We must also
use new and innovative methods to find "hidden" or "blind" deposits.

Another challenge we face is that [50 years we did not mine for many of
these critical minerals and as such some rocks containing key materials
were not processed correctly and ended up in tailings
piles]{.underline}. Consequently, our understanding of, and current
mining practices around these metals, is poor in comparison to others.
[Therefore [**we need to increase exploration** for these critical raw
materials]{.mark}. This is where the Arctic region can come in to
help]{.underline}.

[[The Arctic got the opportunities to be a prime area for
mining]{.underline}]{.mark}

The solution to the supply problem is relatively straightforward. We can
either mine more, recycle better, or massively reduce our consumption.
[The main challenge with the latter solution is that many of the
elements used in modern devices were not used in older products. And
that the amounts we need are greater]{.underline} than historically
mined. For just copper, we use four times more of it in an electric car
than in an internal combustion engine.

Therefore, we need to mine.

There is a saying, when is the right time to plant a tree? The answer is
yesterday, but when is the second-best time? And the answer is today.
The same goes for mining. We should have started to invest a long time
ago but we can still make it if we start today.

[First the good news, we don't lack the raw materials.]{.underline} [In
fact, for example, the so-called [rare earth **elements** are not **very
rare at all**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [What we lack is **robust finance**
for **mining**]{.underline}, quicker permitting, and customers who are
willing to pay a premium for more responsible mining.

While mining activities have been undertaken for thousands of years, the
**[mining]{.underline}** industry [in the Arctic is moving towards
**maximum benefits** with **minimum impact.**]{.underline} Whilst
**[mining]{.underline}** by its nature is not sustainable, it [can be
responsible]{.underline}. [The [**latest technologies** in **mining**
can help to mitigate and minimize **environmental** a]{.mark}nd
**societal [impacts]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Some of the main obstacles facing mining are the absolutist anti-mining
positions taken by some interest groups and well-meaning forces in the
developed world. However, these harsh line policies can often result in
the opposite outcome in regard to biodiversity and global impact. As
without support we instead experience a "mining leakage" where the
projects don't disappear but are instead shifted to faraway places.
Mines are shifted from nations with benign practices, strict human
rights, and environmental regulations to regions with less stringent
social and environmental policies.

Some Examples of Inefficient Public Resource Management.

Historically, [federal development of natural resources on federal
lands]{.underline} has received much political support. However,
economic theory over the last few decades has begun to recognize and
document the inefficiencies of resource management practices on federal
lands. For example, Alexander Annett examined federal resource
management and found many examples of the government itself reporting on
its own resource development inefficiencies. For instance:

■ The U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) reported that, in 1999, all
federal land agencies together amassed a backlog of unresolved resource
maintenance problems totaling about \$12 billion. This is an example of
the resource users avoiding the full cost of making poor decisions that
diminish resource values by sharing these costs across U.S. taxpayers.

■ The Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Agriculture found
"pervasive errors" in the accounting and financial reporting processes
of the U.S. Forest Service. This is an example of not using trustworthy
and accurate cost estimates to make good resource development decisions
when the developer's personal funds are not at risk.

■ A 1999 Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report addressed a request by
the major federal land management agencies to expand their management
practices to greater swaths of public lands. The CBO suggested that
"environmental objectives such as habitat protection... might be best
met by improving the quality of management in currently held areas,
rather than trying to manage an even larger domain." It appears the CBO
recognized that further centralization of resource development [would
produce less efficient]{.underline}, rather than more efficient,
[resource development.]{.underline}

Public Resource Managers Do Not Face Effective Incentives.

Clearly, public-sector managers of the country's natural resources do
not face the same incentive structure as private resource owners when
trying to develop resources efficiently. In fact, they are insulated
from the same incentives facing private resource developers. For
example:

■ Public resource managers are not allowed to enjoy the full benefits
from making good resource development decisions that raise the market
value of the resource. It is perceived as unethical for public resource
managers to seek private gains from public resource use.

■ Public resource managers are not forced to bear the full costs of
making bad resource development decisions that lower the value of the
resource. The public resource manager is insulated from making bad
resource development decisions, because any resulting losses from
diminished resource values are shared across all of the taxpayers.

■ [Public resource managers are less likely to explore and discover
innovative uses of the resource that enhance its value through
entrepreneurial activity]{.underline}. The cost and risks of innovation
and discovery outweigh the minimal public-sector rewards a public
resource manager can expect for making good resource development
choices.

■ Public sector managers are less likely to accurately compare true
benefits against true costs. When direct rewards and penalties are not
connected to specific resource development decisions, public resource
managers are motivated to under-estimate the costs, and exaggerate the
benefits, of their development policies. Further, it is difficult for
voters or members of Congress --- the vast majority of whom are not
specialists in the resources being managed --- to adequately determine
the legitimacy of these claims and determine whether the resource is
being developed in a way that enhances its economic value to society.

Indeed, when public resource managers are insulated from being held
directly accountable for the quality of their resource development
decisions, they are often perceived as being more effective only when
their management scope, program budget and agency staffing continue to
grow over time. Non-specialists can only assume that demands for ever
more funding and staffing will enable public resource managers to make
even better resource development decisions. In other words, failure to
support these programs with additional funds and staff is perceived by
the public as not adequately caring about the resource development
issues that the public sector managers are facing. This misperception
provides an incentive for public sector resource managers to
artificially inflate the potential benefit measures assigned to their
proposed resource development decisions, and to artificially deflate the
true cost of taking funding away from other important but competing
public sector programs. This strategy helps fund an ever larger scope of
operations, which justifies bigger budgets and larger staffing needs.

Who Owns the Earth's Ocean Resources?

It is worth considering to what extent the U.S. federal government
retains a claim over the Earth's ocean resources in a way that is
recognized by other nations. Indeed, ownership rights for most of the
Earth's vast ocean resources have not yet been fully defined and
globally allocated. International maritime laws have been widely
recognized since the 17th century. However, under this global
institution, a nation's ownership rights over ocean resources were
limited to a relatively small, three-nauticalmile belt of water
extending from a nation's coastlines. All ocean waters beyond that limit
were considered international waters where all nations could navigate
and exploit the resources in and under the oceans. For the bulk of the
Earth's vast ocean resources, any claims by private parties or
governments have not been broadly recognized. Any development that did
occur resulted from a nation's unilateral claim to that specific
resource, backed by observable efforts to extract or otherwise utilize
the claimed ocean resource. This perspective reflected the natural law
principle of mare liberum.

The Law of the Sea. More recently, however, international treaties that
govern ocean resources along the continental shelf outside of national
boundaries have been broadly (but not universally) adopted. The largest,
most comprehensive treaty is the United Nations Convention on the Law of
the Sea (UNCLOS), established in 1982. However, it has been recognized
by only 60 of the over 200 countries around the world. This treaty
stipulates that:

■ Ownership rights to all ocean resources, from the sea surface down to
the seabed and below, are granted to a nation within a roughly a
12-nautical-mile extension of that nation's coastal boundaries.

■ Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) are defined as roughly 200 nautical
miles from the nation's costal boundaries. In this zone, the country
retains all ocean resource ownership rights, but that country must allow
free transit (termed innocent passage) to peaceful ocean transport by
all private and government-owned shipping vessels.

■ When a nation's continental shelf extends beyond its EEZ, that nation
has unlimited ownership rights to the nonrenewable resources on and
under the seabed, but does not have ownership rights to the renewable
resources within the sea or on the seabed.

■ Outside the EEZ or continental shelf zone, ownership rights to any
renewable or nonrenewable ocean resources are not recognized by any one
nation. However, many countries have negotiated various multiparty
treaties regarding the renewable resources that transit across
neighboring ocean areas. Further, some nations have tried to amend
UNCLOS to allocate ownership rights to nonrenewable resources within the
vast areas of the open ocean. The United States does not currently
recognize this amendment.

**[Private Development of the Earth's Ocean Resources is the Best
Option]{.underline}**

Aligning private rewards with public interests in resource development
would encourage private ocean resource owners to develop these resources
to their highest market value[. This is made possible when the federal
government creates innovative institutions that allow for the
privatization of common use resource development]{.underline}. Indeed,
an example can be seen from Burnett's examination of world fisheries
that was discussed earlier. His research reveals that some countries
have tried privatizing certain types of fish stocks within their own
EEZs. A process for scientifically maintaining a healthy fish stock is
used to identify a maximum limit on total annual fish harvests. This
total limit is then divided into individual transferable quotas (called
ITQs), which are tradable units that can be bought and sold by fishing
boat captains in a market exchange.

#### Private vs. federal development are distinct concepts that structure the expectation of all negative ground

the Rusche College of Business; NCPA, "Economics of the 2014-2015 Debate

[A careful examination of **public versus private ocean resource
development** indicates that federal policies for ocean resource
development should **avoid direct public management**]{.underline} of
these common use resources. The incentive structure facing public sector
resource managers does not align private rewards with the public
interest in developing ocean resources to their highest market value. As
shown above, even a truly democratic setting can fail to produce
economically efficient public resource development practices. [Instead,
the federal government should promote innovative ways to allow private
ownership]{.underline} over common use ocean resources. [When
private]{.underline} resource [development decisions are made while
facing the full potential costs and rewards for enhancing the value of
ocean resources, this maximizes the motivation for these resource owners
to make development decisions that raise the ocean resource to its
highest market value]{.underline}.

Provisions for Federal Agency Actions

Congress ensured the representation of federal agency interests when
implementing the CZMA by providing administrative grants only to those
states that allowed full participation of relevant federal agencies in
the development of their management programs (Section 306\[d\]\[1\]).
After such participation in the development of its state management
program, Section 307(c)(1)(A) mandates that:

Each federal agency activity within or outside the coastal zone that
affects any land or water use or natural resource of the coastal zone
shall be carried out in a manner which is consistent to the maximum
extent practicable with the enforceable policies of approved state
management programs.

An extensive review and evaluation process (implemented by regulations
at 15 Code of Federal Regulations \[CFR\] part 930) ensures such
\"federal consistency.\" The process includes preliminary measures,
project review guidelines, and notification and consultation. DOE must
comply with federal consistency requirements when construction or other
activities potentially affect the coastal zone.

Federal consistency is required for federal agency actions that include:

federal agency activities, including development projects (15 CFR part
930, subpart C) (see definitions below);

actions requiring a federal license or permit (15 CFR part 930, subpart
D);

outer continental shelf (OCS) exploration, development, and production
activities (15 CFR part 930, subpart E); and,

federal assistance to state and local governments (15 CFR part 930,
subpart F).

\"[The term \'federal agency activity\' means any function performed
by]{.underline} or on behalf of [a federal agency]{.underline} in the
exercise of its statutory responsibilities.\" (15 CFR 930.31\[a\]) The
term encompasses a wide range of federal agency activities that initiate
an event or series of events where coastal effects are reasonably
foreseeable (e.g., a proposal to physically alter coastal resources, a
proposed plan that would direct future agency actions, a proposed
rulemaking that would alter uses of the coastal zone). [The term does
not include issuing a federal license or permit to an
applicant]{.underline} or person [or granting federal
assistance]{.underline} to an applicant agency.

[\"The term federal \'development project\' means a federal agency
activity involving the planning, construction, modification, or removal
of public works]{.underline}, facilities, or other structures [and

**Bullen 8** -- JD (Linda, "SPECIAL FEATURE: NEPA 101: INTRODUCTION TO
THE RIM WILAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT," 16 Nevada Lawyer 6, Lexis)

The NEPA statute is divided into two parts. Title I establishes the
policy behind NEPA. Recognizing the profound impact of man\'s activity
on the natural environment, Congress declared \"that it is the
continuing policy of the Federal Government, in cooperation with state
and local governments and other concerned public and private
organizations, to use all practicable means and measures, including
financial and technical assistance, in a manner calculated to foster and
promote the general welfare, to create and maintain conditions under
which man and nature can exist in productive harmony, and fulfill the
social, economic, and other requirements of present and future
generations of Americans.\'\" Consistent with its overarching policy,
NEPA makes three specific demands. First, it requires that the federal
government conform to the following six goals: 1) to fulfill the
responsibilities of each generation as trustee of the environment for
succeeding generations; 2) to assure for all Americans safe, healthful,
productive and aesthetically and culturally pleasing surroundings; 3) to
attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the environment without
degradation, risk to health or safety, or other undesirable and
unintended consequences; \[7\] 4) to preserve important historic,
cultural and natural aspects of our national heritage, and maintain,
wherever possible, an environment which supports diversity and variety
of individual choice; 5) to achieve a balance between population and
resource use that will permit high standards of living and a wide
sharing of life\'s amenities; and 6) to enhance the quality of renewable
resources and approach the maximum attainable recycling of depletable
resources.\' Second, NEPA recognizes that each person deserves to enjoy
a healthful environment and requires that each person contribute to the
preservation and betterment of the environment. 4 Third, NEPA mandates
that \"the policies, regulations, and public laws of the United
States\...be interpreted and administered in accordance with the
policies set forth in this Act.\"\' The Environmental Impact Statement
(EIS) is the aspect of NEPA that is most well-known to the public, and
NEPA requires an EIS on all \"major Federal actions significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment.\' Each EIS must contain
a detailed statement on the environmental impact of the proposed action,
any unavoidable adverse environmental effects, the relationship between
short-term uses and long-term productivity, and any irreversible and
irretrievable commitment of resources associated with implementation of
the proposed action.\' [The term \"[action]{.mark}\" [includes]{.mark}

International Collaboration in the Arctic

The Arctic research community has long been a beacon and a bastion of
international collaborations. International partnerships with European
and Asian partners greatly advanced our understanding of the role of the
Arctic in the global climate system. Such cooperation promotes more
rapid learning and more efficient achievements.

[Following Russia\'s]{.underline} further [invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline} in February, [[the U.S. ceased
**gov**]{.mark}ernment**[-to-gov]{.mark}**ernment]{.underline} and
multilateral [[engagement with Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} that was not
in the U.S. national security interest. [[Research]{.mark} that has been
[disrupted]{.mark} [includes]{.mark} [field studies]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} natural carbon emissions, [[permafrost]{.mark}
degradation]{.underline}, large river discharges, and population
dynamics of walrus, polar bears, and waterfowl. Since Russia decided to
escalate this brutal war, [[**Federal** scientists]{.mark} have [ceased
these partnerships]{.mark} and shelved plans for new joint
efforts]{.underline}. [We have had no choice but to forgo the regular
collegial communications that enriched our understanding of Arctic
science since the thawing of the Cold War]{.underline}.

Russia's unlawful invasion of Ukraine has caused tremendous suffering
and a cascade of misery throughout Europe; the disruption of Arctic
science is but one negative outcome that is far outweighed by the loss
of life and threats to democracy. However, we must not ignore the impact
to science, and we remain hopeful that Russia will fully withdraw from
Ukraine and end this war. It was through scientific partnerships and
collaborations that the U.S. and Russia developed a more open working
relationship at various points in history. We remain hopeful that the
scientific friendships we developed in the past can one day pave the way
for mutual respect and cooperation in science and policy. It is for this
reason that I worry about proposals to erect barriers to future
scientific collaboration, such as a policy contained in Section 535 of
H.R. 8256, the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies
Appropriations Act, 2023, which would prohibit OSTP, NASA, and the
National Space Council from collaborating with Russia.

[The magnitude of the challenges associated with climate change in the
Arctic are simply too great for any nation to resolve in
isolation]{.underline}. [We must continue to collaborate]{.underline}
with our international partners, particularly [in field studies and
observations]{.underline}, but also by sharing results, accomplishments,
and understanding.

[The US Arctic Research Commission]{.underline}
([[USARC]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[is a]{.mark}n independent [federal

#### The plan only governs federally funded and controlled research

Mitch **Ambrose,** 20**22** -- Mitch manages AIP's science policy
newsletters and resources. He previously was a fellow at the Science and
Technology Policy Institute and worked for the Senate Commerce, Science,
and Transportation Committee. "US Restricts Science Collaborations with
Russia" American Institute of Physics, 6/17,

https://www.aip.org/fyi/2022/us-restricts-science-collaborations-russia

The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy announced on
June 11 that [[the U.S. will "wind down" research collaborations with
Russia]{.mark} in response to its invasion of Ukraine. [The policy
applies to **federally funded projects**]{.mark} involving research
institutions and individuals affiliated with the Russian
government]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} it [permits non-government
organizations]{.mark} in the U.S. [to make their own decisions]{.mark}
on whether to continue collaborations]{.underline}.

The announcement arrived just before OSTP Acting Director Alondra Nelson
participated in a summit of science ministers from the G7 countries,
comprising the U.S., U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Canada. In
a joint statement, the ministers declared their commitment to
restricting government-funded research projects involving participation
by the Russian government, though they left the door open for engagement
with individual scientists.

"In the spirit of science diplomacy, we will continue the dialogue
between civil societies, including exchanges with Russian scientists and
students to the furthest extent possible, especially through the
promotion of individual academic and student mobility," they wrote.

US follows Europe in cutting official science ties

While the U.S. was quick to implement sweeping economic sanctions and
technology export controls on Russia, the White House had until now been
silent on whether it would pause or sever scientific ties between the
countries. By contrast, many European countries moved quickly to impose
official restrictions on science collaborations.

OSTP and the State Department declined requests for interviews about the
new U.S. policy but provided written responses to some questions.

Explaining why the U.S. chose to take an explicit stance on restricting
science collaborations, [a State Department spokesperson
stated]{.underline}, "Considering Russia's war crimes and other
atrocities committed by Russia's forces in Ukraine, [we recognize the
importance that we make clear what our research policy is to those who
are ultimately responsible for implementing it.]{.underline}"

[[The policy applies to both federal agencies and organizations they
sponsor, such as **national labs**]{.mark}, and instructs such
organizations to contact their agency sponsor for further
guidance]{.underline}.

In general, the policy prohibits new projects in "affected subject
areas," but ones begun before the start of the invasion on Feb. 24 will
be allowed to continue to completion. [[Federal agencies
will]{.underline}]{.mark} also "[[curtail interaction" with]{.mark}
leaders of [institutions affiliated with the Russian
government]{.mark}]{.underline} as well as with "those who have publicly
expressed support for the invasion of Ukraine."

While the policy states the U.S. will limit engagement with Russia in
"various international projects and initiatives related to science and
technology," it indicates partnerships will continue in areas where
required by "international law."

An OSTP spokesperson identified the ITER fusion facility under
construction in France as an example of a multilateral project where the
U.S. is compelled to continue engagement with Russia, which is a
founding member of ITER.

"There is no provision for expulsion of a member state from the ITER
project," the spokesperson stated. "The U.S. is in close cooperation
with its European, Indian, Japanese, and Korean partners concerning
Russia's future participation. Fusion energy science, including our
continued membership in ITER, continues to be a priority for the
Biden-Harris administration."

The spokesperson also offered one example of the U.S. curtailing
interaction with Russia, pointing to its decision in March to freeze
participation in the Arctic Council, a forum currently chaired by Russia
that coordinates multilateral activities in the region, including
research. The spokesperson noted that on June 8 the U.S. and other
Arctic Council nations announced they would resume some projects so long
as they do not involve participation by the Russian government.

Vice tightening on collaborations with Russian scientists

Beyond ITER, the U.S. also has significant partnerships with Russia
through the CERN particle physics lab in Europe. Russia and the U.S. are
not CERN member states but both are among the largest contributors to
the facility, with more than 1,000 scientists affiliated with Russian
institutions currently involved in the lab's experimental program.

CERN began to suspend interactions with the Russian government in March,
while permitting scientists affiliated with Russian institutions to
continue working there. However, today CERN announced its intent to not
renew its cooperation agreement with Russia, which expires in December
2024, meaning scientists affiliated with Russian institutions will be
unable to work at CERN after that date. CERN also plans to not renew its
cooperation agreement with Belarus, which served as a staging ground for
Russia's invasion.

Confirming the decision's impact on scientists, a CERN spokesperson
stated, "They can continue their scientific work on current activities
until the expiry. If at that time their institutions are outside Russia
and Belarus, they may continue to work at CERN. The Council's decision
applies to the countries and their institutions, not to individuals."

One outstanding question is whether Russian scientists will be permitted
to participate in projects involving the Department of Energy's user
facilities, such as its X-ray and neutron sources, which are open to
scientists from around the world. Based on statistics compiled by DOE,
220 Russian scientists used the facilities in the fiscal year preceding
the pandemic. Two Russian nuclear science institutions are also partners
on the internationally administered Deep Underground Neutrino
Experiment, which will be built in South Dakota.

OSTP deferred to individual science agencies for examples of projects
that will be affected by the new policy. A spokesperson for the DOE
Office of Science declined to comment, while a spokesperson for [[the
National Science Foundation]{.underline}]{.mark} indicated the agency
[[is "unlikely to make new \[grant\] awards with Russian
collaboration]{.underline}]{.mark}."

The spokesperson noted [NSF generally does not directly fund Russian
institutions but has a "handful" of grants to U.S. institutions with
subawards to Russian entities,]{.underline} often for field technicians.
"We encourage all researchers to consider whether this is the best time
for activity involving Russian collaboration or fieldwork, given the
current situation and risks associated with it. Researchers are
encouraged to consider whether their research objectives can be
accomplished through other means," the spokesperson stated.

[In NSF's grant database, a few dozen active projects reference Russia,
primarily in relation to Arctic research]{.underline}. The database
lists three grants where the primary recipient was a Russian
institution, all involving cases where NSF paid for a Russian icebreaker
to resupply McMurdo Station in Antarctica a handful of times prior to
2014.

In general, U.S. government collaboration with Russia chilled
significantly following its seizure of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, with
a key exception being the continued joint operation of the International
Space Station, which is a legally binding partnership. Although Russian
space agency head Dmitry Rogozin has made some inflammatory statements
about the ISS partnership, it has to date weathered strain from the war.

#### State-funded scientists make it [governmental]{.underline} action

Pavel **Devyatkin,** 20**23** -- senior associate at the Arctic
Institute (Washington, DC) and a PhD fellow and lecturer at HSE
University (Moscow) "Can Arctic Cooperation be Restored?" 3/28,
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/can-arctic-cooperation-restored/

[We are witnessing a severing of state-to-state cooperation after
Russia's military actions in Ukraine]{.underline}. Right up
[until]{.underline} February 24, [2022, there was effective interstate
circumpolar cooperation across various institutions and
frameworks]{.underline}. Even just the day before, on February 23, 2022,
Russia's ambassador to Norway read an opening speech written by Russian
Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov at the Kirkenes Conference in the
Norwegian Arctic. The speech mentioned "mutual assistance and
good-neighborly relations" in the Arctic and complimented the Kirkenes
conference as a setting for "constructive and depoliticized discussion
of the pressing issues of international cooperation."1)

From my experience as an American scholar based in Russia during this
volatile period, I believe most [[Russian decision makers would]{.mark}
still [be supportive of Arctic cooperation, but **government-level**
cooperation, such as **collaboration between state funded scientists**,
is]{.mark}]{.underline} more [[difficult]{.underline}]{.mark} than ever.
Some Russian decision makers are wholly pessimistic about the return of
cooperation. Alexey Drobinin, director of the Russian Ministry of
Foreign Affairs' (MFA) policy planning department, said, "The period of
constructive cooperation between Russia and Western countries is gone
for good, regardless of the outcome of Russia's special operation in
Ukraine."2)

After seven of the AC states boycotted Russia's AC chairmanship in
March, Nikolay [Korchunov, Russia's Senior Arctic Official and Arctic
Ambassador]{.underline}, called the pause "regrettable" and warned that
it would pose "risks and challenges to soft security." Korchunov
stressed that Arctic cooperation "should not be subject to the
spill-over effect of any extra-regional events." Korchunov [said, "it is
of utmost importance to safeguard the project activities of the Arctic
Council]{.underline} in order to be able to pick up where we paused [and
**step up cooperation.**"]{.underline}3)

Evidently, [Russia places great importance on its position in the
AC]{.underline}. Russian experts and diplomats have said Russia's
exclusion is counterproductive and irrational. Russian Ambassador to the
United States, Anatoly Antonov, and Minister of Natural Resources,
Alexander Kozlov, have gone as far as calling it illegitimate and
claiming that the boycott violates the principles of consensus given
that Russia is the chair of the AC during this period.4) Russian and
international scientists have also drawn attention to data gaps that
result from cutting off Russian Arctic scientists. Arctic climate
research is crucial since warming in the region is a bellwether for
global climate change. As such statements demonstrate, [Arctic
cooperation with Western states is important to Russia, especially in
regard to its recognition as a great power]{.underline}.

#### Plan's funded and directed by the US government, even if on Russian territory

Pavel **Devyatkin,** 20**22** -- senior associate at the Arctic
Institute (Washington, DC) and a PhD fellow and lecturer at HSE
University (Moscow) "Environmental Détente: U.S.-Russia Arctic science
diplomacy through political tensions" The Polar Journal, v12, Taylor &
Francis database, accessed via University of Michigan

**NSF = National Science Foundation, a US government agency**

[There are now fears that science diplomacy is dead in the
Arctic]{.underline}. The escalation of [the Ukraine
conflict]{.underline} in 2022 has [severely strained Arctic
cooperation]{.underline}. In March 2022, the other seven AC member
states condemned Russia and called for a pause of the Council's work
during Russia's chairmanship in March 2022. 101 AC Working and Expert
groups have been halted. Arctic scientists continue to work on research,
but 'there should be no exchange of data or official publishing,'
according to Norway's Senior Arctic Official Morten Høglund. 102 Many
other Arctic organisations, such as the IASC, likewise criticised Russia
and/or paused work. 103 Russia's Arctic officials called the suspension
'regrettable' and declared that it was important to preserve AC
activities, 'so that -- when circumstances allow -- cooperation can
continue without prejudice to those who depend on these projects.' 104
Russia has subsequently reoriented its chairmanship agenda towards a
domestic scope on the Russian North.

Meanwhile, John Kerry, serving as Biden's climate change envoy,
nevertheless expressed his hope that Putin would 'stay on track' in
combatting climate change.105 Still, high-level U.S.-Russia science
cooperation was further blunted after [[the White House announced a
termination of scientific cooperation with Russian government-affiliated
institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}. 106 [[The move]{.underline}]{.mark}
ostensibly [[suspends]{.mark} numerous **[NSF-funded
projects]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[that]{.mark} have [enabled
collaborations]{.mark} between U.S. and Russian scientists [such as
studies of]{.mark}]{.underline} Indigenous communities in Kamchatka,
Chukotka, and Alaska, the interaction of social and natural systems in
Yamal, and [[permafrost degradation across the Russian
Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline}107 It is now up to non-government
institutions and researchers to make their own decisions regarding
continued cooperation.

The situation is dismal as Russia's AC chairmanship and the Biden
administration share mutual interests in environmental protection and
climate change. For example, both countries are parties to the Agreement
to Prevent Unregulated High Seas Fisheries in the Central Arctic Ocean,
which commits the parties to establish a Joint Program of Scientific
Research and Monitoring to study the Arctic ecosystem. 108 [There
are]{.underline} still calls [from international Arctic scholars for
cooperation in such crucial spheres and to support the collective
benefit of a functioning AC]{.underline}. 109 Scientists who had
participated in MOSAiC said that tensions over the conflict cripple
Arctic research: ['If we limit access \[to the Russian Arctic\], we will
miss some important insights to better understand how and why the Arctic
system is changing]{.underline},' said Matthew Shupe, an atmospheric
scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder. 110 In working towards
improving Arctic science diplomacy, it is important to remember these
challenges and conditions. Science diplomacy is essential for
maintaining scientific cooperation; when science diplomacy breaks down,
science cooperation deteriorates as well. In this case, science
diplomacy holds the key to reigniting scientific cooperation if Arctic
cooperation is ever fully resumed.

In conclusion, the historical legacies and modern examples of
U.S.-Russia collaborations demonstrate the value of Arctic science
cooperation and the importance of science diplomacy to realise such
initiatives. When tensions were reduced, science diplomacy as a process
produced beneficial outcomes, but it is also an important instrument to
maintain some relations even during aggravated international relations.
This is evidenced by the proliferation of scientific knowledge as well
as the opening of communication channels that builds confidence. On one
hand, cooperation can bridge inequalities in resources, capabilities,
experience, and knowledge between countries. On the other hand,
[scientific collaboration serves as a foundation for relationships
between nations and builds trust among involved actors]{.underline}.
[This is especially valuable for maintaining stability amid changes in
the global balance of power.]{.underline} Science diplomacy can lead to
dialogue between people who would otherwise be adversaries to think in
terms of common interests.

Arctic.

The Strategy's Ways and Means

To deter Russia and China from threatening U.S. interests in the Arctic,
the U.S. military needs to demonstrate presence in the region beyond
submarines. Submarines can deter large-scale attacks but are less useful
against coercion and intimidation. Deterring Russia will require Navy
surface assets (manned and unmanned) and a more robust air and ground
presence in the European and North Atlantic Arctic. It is difficult to
police fisheries, monitor potentially hostile surface ships, or target
airborne intruders without capabilities in the region. As Adm. James
Foggo said of the Arctic when commanding Allied Joint Forces Command in
Italy, "In order to deter, you have to be present. You've got to be
there and you've got to be there quickly." Gen. Glen VanHerck, commander
of U.S. Northern Command and the North American Aerospace Defense
Command, made similar remarks in late April 2021.

Capabilities

Budget constraints, however, will prevent large-scale acquisition of
military equipment designed for the Arctic. There are just too many
competing demands on the defense budget. A handful of modern icebreakers
and limited numbers of the Army's new cold-weather vehicle may be the
extent of new, manned Arctic capabilities funded for the foreseeable
future. That said, the United States could shift cold-weather-capable
equipment to the region, especially unmanned intelligence, surveillance,
and reconnaissance platforms. Unmanned capabilities need not have been
developed for the Arctic per se but could be adapted for use in the
region.

[[There is a role for the U.S. private sector in **developing**
Arctic]{.mark} capabilities and **[infrastructure]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[if given the right government
**inducement**]{.mark}**s**]{.underline}. [[One promising area is
satellite communication]{.underline}]{.mark} and positioning systems.
Satellite [companies are potentially attractive government partners. The
U.S. military is looking into private-sector efforts such as the OneWeb
and Starlink polar communication satellites]{.underline}. The European
Space Agency is doing the same with Arctic weather satellites. There is
no reason these initiatives could not be expanded.

[The Biden administration's [**Arctic** strategy should consider the
role of extractive industries]{.mark}]{.underline} ([oil, mining,
timber, fishing) in the region]{.underline}. [Those industries have
built much of the nonmilitary infrastructure in Alaska. In the future,
as the global economy shifts from hydrocarbons to green energy,
government [efforts to foster **infrastructure
development**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[could focus on]{.mark} distributed
**electricity [grids]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[[port]{.mark}
facilitie[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[and]{.mark} overland
[freight]{.mark} transport]{.underline} [[associated with]{.mark}
**mineral extraction**]{.underline} (particularly **[[rare earth
minerals]{.underline}]{.mark}**) rather than on oil and gas. All are
consistent with the Biden climate plan. [New ports and rail lines could
be [funded through **cost**-**sharing** agreements between the
government and business]{.mark}, which could make **infrastructure**
cost-effective for business while saving the taxpayer
money.]{.underline} [The **private sector** could use the
**infrastructure** during **normal times**]{.underline}, [with the U.S.
military having priority use during military exercises or national
emergencies.]{.underline}

Political Will

Demonstrating the political will to use Arctic capabilities unilaterally
or in conjuncture with allies and partners is the other prerequisite for
successful deterrence and defense. The most important priority should be
to convince allies that the United States is a reliable security
partner. Some of that persuasion has already begun with the Biden
administration's reaffirmation of the U.S. commitment to NATO's Article
5 security guarantees and Blinken's consultations in Denmark before the
May 2021 Arctic Council ministerial meeting.

Persuading allies also requires demonstrating the ability to come to
their defense if needed, regardless of climate conditions. Unilateral,
bilateral, and "mini-multilateral" military exercises are all useful as
practice and as international signals in the Arctic. Unilaterally, the
U.S. Army is starting to relearn how to operate in the Arctic, as
highlighted in its Arctic strategy. The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps
learned important lessons from NATO's Trident Juncture exercise in 2018
and smaller exercises since then. More exercises are needed to
demonstrate to friend and foe alike that the U.S. military can again
operate in cold climates.

In addition, **[[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[should expand]{.underline} **[its
use]{.underline}** [of flexible basing and **deployment** agreements
with allies]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The recent agreement covering the
U.S. military's use of the Ramsund naval facility and Evenes air base in
northern Norway are a good start. A similar arrangement could be made
for the Danish air force to have permanent facilities at the U.S. base
in Thule,]{.underline} Greenland, for search and rescue, air
surveillance, anti-submarine warfare, and air interdiction missions,
something that could tie allied forces more closely together, better
defend this early warning facility, and improve surveillance in the
Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom gap. Expansion of the runway and
facilities on Norway's Jan Mayen island and refurbishing an additional
airfield in Greenland in conjunction with the Danes could serve similar
purposes. Finally, [the [United States could coordinate existing niche
capabilities]{.mark} amongst Arctic allies, an]{.underline} Arctic
version of NATO's Connected Forces Initiative.

As noted above, under NEPA, federal agencies are only required to
prepare an EIS for "major federal actions significantly affecting the
quality of the human environment." For the purposes of NEPA[, [federal
actions include "projects]{.mark}]{.underline} and programs [entirely or
[partly financed]{.mark}]{.underline}, assisted, conducted, regulated,
[[or]{.underline} [approved by Federal
agencies]{.underline}]{.mark}."121 Thus, where a federal agency proposes
to undertake a soil amendment project, that would qualify as a "federal
action" under NEPA. Soil amendment [[projects]{.mark} proposed
[by]{.mark} non-federal actors (e.g., [private
individuals]{.mark}]{.underline} or companies) might also [[qualify if
the projects are funded, approved]{.mark}, or otherwise regulated [by a
federal agency]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In the latter case,
however, [[the project will]{.mark} only [be considered a federal
action]{.mark}]{.underline} under NEPA [[if]{.mark} it is "[subject to
Federal control]{.mark} and responsibility]{.underline}."122 As
discussed in Part 4.1.4 below, many privately developed soil amendment
projects will likely require federal permits and thus be subject to
federal control.

[[Renewable energy]{.mark} developments [that **take federal**]{.mark}

sufficient funding for renewable energy construction. Therefore, the
federal government affects the outcome of renewable energy development
through the availability of tax credits/grants. Hence, [when the

Permitting decisions by the Army Corps of Engineers under either CWA or
the Rivers and Harbors Act are themselves subject to environmental
review under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). NEPA mandates
preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) for any "major
Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human
environment."184 "[Major Federal actions" include "projects and programs
entirely or partly financed]{.underline}, assisted, conducted,
regulated, [or approved by federal agencies," even if those projects are
primarily conducted by private parties]{.underline}.185 NEPA requires
the Army Corps of Engineers to review the environmental impact of its
permits under CWA and the Rivers and Harbors Act, but other actions by
federal agencies may also trigger NEPA review. While actions by CO2
pipeline regulators that do not issue discretionary permits, like PHMSA,
will not implicate NEPA,186 more discretionary functions, like BLM's
issuance of pipeline rights-of-way, often will.187 However, "NEPA is a
procedural statute only; it makes no substantive demands on the federal
agencies" and "mandates no particular result from the consideration of
environmental impacts, but only that those impacts be identified and
considered."188

P21. At the outset of our analysis, we note our disagreement with the
dissent\'s narrow interpretation of the phrase \"its schools\" in
Article 8, Section 206. Miss. Const. art. 8, § 206. While \"its\" is a
possessive-case pronoun that refers to the antecedent \"county or
separate school district,\" the dissent\'s interpretation unnecessarily
restricts the meaning of \"its\" in Article 8, Section 206. First,
[possessive-case pronouns convey more than mere possession.]{.underline}
Bryan A. Garner, The Redbook: A Manual on Legal Style § 10.17, at 186

P22. Within the context of the broad grant of authority given to the
Legislature under Article 8, Section 201, and [given the plain

Under the statutory requirements for exemption, it is not enough that
the taxpayer\'s \[\*\*\*12\] investments were \"loans secured by the
mortgage of real estate.\" The investments must also have been its \--
that is, the taxpayer\'s \-- loans. [The Commissioner]{.underline}
apparently [would have us construe the term \"its\" as requiring direct
legal ownership]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} we think [the plain and
ordinary meaning of the term \"its\" does not support such an
interpretation]{.underline}. A bank may come into possession of a
mortgage loan either by directly issuing a loan secured by the mortgage
of real estate or by acquiring a loan previously issued by another
lender. See, e.g., G. L. c. 167E, § 2(A), as appearing in St. 1982, c.
155, § 9 (a bank \"may make, acquire by purchase, participate in or
service first mortgage real estate loans of \[certain\] classes\").
Similarly, a bank\'s ownership of a mortgage loan may be legal or
equitable. See, e.g., G. L. c. 167E, § 2(B)(12), as appearing in St.
1982, c. 155, \[\*\*467\] § 9 (authorizing participation loans in which
the participating entities enter into a written agreement including
\"provisions for the custody of the note and mortgage in the
commonwealth and for the servicing and foreclosure thereof\"). [The term
\"its\"]{.underline} certainly [connotates ownership, but does not
itself provide a basis for distinguishing]{.underline} \[\*\*\*13\]
[between direct and indirect]{.underline} or between legal and equitable
[ownership]{.underline}.

in Arlington, Virginia, and in Anchorage, Alaska. In addition to
establishing the goals in this report, [[the Commission]{.underline}
[develops]{.underline}]{.mark} and recommends [an integrated [national
Arctic research policy and builds cooperative links]{.mark} in Arctic
research]{.underline} within the federal government, with the State of

review the Arctic research budget \"crosscut\* in the President\'s
annual budget request and report to Congress on how the crosscut adheres
to the five- year Arctic Research Plan produced by the Interagency
Arctic Research Policy Committee (IARPC).

[USARC plays a significant role in planning and

Maddock, 2015; Henderson & Loe, 2014). In 2003, the Russian Ministry of
Natural Resources and Ecology and the Russian Federal Agency of Mineral
Resources initiated cooperation on a series of Circum-Arctic geological
and geophysical maps. In 2005, the key Arctic states such as Canada,
Denmark, Finland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the USA signed the
agreement. After three years of teamwork, the first results were gained
(Government of Finland, 2013).

international cooperation within the framework of the exploration of the
Arctic, as well as forecasts its development in the future. It is
expected that the long-standing comprehensive studies of the Arctic will
be continued due to the specific importance of this region for the
future of the mankind. Robotic marine expeditions will start a new era
in the exploration of the Arctic Ocean. Taking into account the
complexity and high costs of polar studies and the growing interest of
many countries to the High North, the international collaboration in the
Arctic is expected to grow.

roadblocks to successful collaboration. What barriers exist to effective
international partnerships in the Arctic? How can scientists and
governments forge closer ties, and what lessons can successful
collaborations provide? Answering these questions will shed light on
important issues that will affect research in the High North for decades
to come.

[[The commission]{.underline}]{.mark} has also [[worked with]{.mark} the
[State]{.mark} Department [to foster international cooperation in Arctic
research]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, in 2016, [[the commission
organized]{.underline}]{.mark} and helped conduct
[[the]{.mark}]{.underline} inaugural, biennial [[Arctic Science
Ministerial meeting, on **behalf of the White
House**]{.mark}.]{.underline} This meeting involved senior officials
from over two dozen nations and from Arctic Indigenous peoples'
organizations. [The [USARC]{.mark} has supported and [helped]{.mark}
shape the agendas of international partnerships]{.underline} [like
the]{.underline} 2007-09 International Polar Year, and [[the creation
of]{.mark} [the International Arctic Research

[the]{.mark}]{.underline} international [[Arctic
Council,]{.underline}]{.mark} formed a decade after ARPA, [[is informed
by coordinated Arctic research]{.mark} and monitoring.]{.underline}

The [USARC]{.underline} also [had a leading role in the drafting and
formal adoption of the Agreement on Enhancing International Arctic
Science Cooperation]{.underline} in 2017, [for which USARC continues to
serve as our nation's "**competent national authority**.]{.underline}"
[The agreement facilitates access by scientists of the eight Arctic
governments to Arctic areas that each government has
identified]{.underline}, including entry and exit of persons, equipment,
and materials; access to research infrastructure and facilities; and
access to data. The agreement also calls for the parties to promote
education, career development, and training opportunities, and
encourages activities associated with traditional and local knowledge.

#### US actions pursuant to the science cooperation agreement are legally under the auspices of the Arctic Council

John **Farrell,** 20**17** - is the Executive Director of the U.S.
Arctic Research Commission "New Agreement to Enhance International
Arctic Scientific Cooperation" October,
https://www.arcus.org/witness-the-arctic/2017/2/article/27780

[The eight [member states of the Arctic Council vowed to improve
cooperation on Arctic science via a legally binding
agreement]{.mark}]{.underline}, entitled \"Agreement
[[on]{.underline}]{.mark} Enhancing International [[Arctic Scientific
Cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}\" signed on 11 May 2017 at the Arctic
Council Ministerial meeting in Fairbanks, Alaska. This was the third
binding agreement initiated in the 20-year history of the Arctic
Council. The first two focused on search-and-rescue and on oil-spill
response.

In short, the goal of this science agreement is to facilitate access,
whether to territory and research areas, platforms, infrastructure,
facilities, materials, samples, data, or equipment. In the words of
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, [[the document promises to ease \"the
movement of scientists, scientific equipment and]{.mark},]{.underline}
importantly, [[data sharing\"]{.underline}]{.mark} across the North.
[Barriers to research, such as denied visas, the inability to carry
equipment and samples across national borders, or denial of access to
data, preclude scientific investigation, slow progress, increase cost,
and retard the growth of knowledge]{.underline}.

In addition to access, the agreement, which was designed to be
inclusive, contains articles that discuss education, career development
and training, traditional and local knowledge, and cooperation with
parties other than the eight Arctic nations.

[[The U.S. and Russia]{.mark} successfully [co-led the effort to reach
this agreement]{.mark}]{.underline}, which required several years of
discussion and negotiation **[[under the auspices
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** an **[[Arctic Council]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Task Force. This cooperative effort was an uncommon bright light in a
currently dark chapter of U.S.-Russia relations. This agreement, and the
Arctic Science Ministerial meeting held at the White House on 28
September 2016, are examples of how science and research across borders
can advance diplomatic efforts through soft power, rather than coercion.
Paul Berkman and co-authors published a paper on this agreement titled,
\"The Arctic Science Agreement propels science diplomacy\" in the 3
November 2017 issue of Science.

Although signed, the agreement will not \"enter into force\" until 30
days after all eight parties have indicated that they have completed all
necessary internal procedures required to enforce the agreement. At the
time of this publication, the U.S., Sweden, Norway, and Finland have
informed Denmark, the \"depositary\" for the agreement, that they have
completed the steps necessary to implement the agreement. The final four
signatories (Russia, Canada, Iceland, and Denmark) have yet to inform
the depositary.

Each party identified geographic areas over which the agreement
pertains. These are contained in an annex to the agreement. The U.S.
Department of State has created a map that graphically displays these
areas (see Figure 1).

For the U.S., the area is the Arctic region as defined in the Arctic
Research and Policy Act of 1984 as amended, and is \"All United States
territory north of the Arctic Circle and north and west of the boundary
formed by the Porcupine, Yukon, and Kuskokwim Rivers; the Aleutian
chain; and adjacent marine areas in the Arctic Ocean and the Beaufort,
Bering, and Chukchi Seas.\" Maps of the U.S. Arctic may be found on the
U.S. Arctic Research Commission (USARC) website.

In practice, will this agreement enhance Arctic scientific cooperation?
While the intent is positive, some question whether it will do so, as
the document has several escape clauses.

For example, the agreement includes phrases such as, \"...shall use
their best efforts...,\" and \"Implementation of this Agreement shall be
subject to the availability of relevant resources.\" And Article 10
reads, \"Activities and obligations under this Agreement shall be
conducted subject to applicable international law and the applicable
laws, regulations, procedures, and policies of the Parties concerned.
For those Parties that have subnational governments, the applicable
laws, regulations, procedures, and policies include those of their
subnational governments.\"

So, it remains possible to deny access despite best efforts that fail,
or to insufficient resources to facilitate access, or to existing
procedures or policies that run counter to the goals of the agreement.

In essence, the validity of the agreement will only be determined when
it is exercised. If denials of access and other challenges can be
overcome through discussion and negotiation facilitated under this
agreement, then it will have merit. The proof will be in the pudding.

The parties to the agreement are currently in the process of
establishing specific procedures and processes necessary to implement
the agreement, and a Terms of Reference may be established.

Generally speaking, Arctic researchers have benefitted from good access
to the pan-Arctic region, but this is not always the case. For example,
entering the Russian Federation has sometimes proven difficult. Between
1990 and 2014, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. [[Department of]{.mark}
[State submitted 48 requests to Russia for U.S. vessels to conduct
marine scientific research in the Russian Exclusive Economic
Zone]{.mark}]{.underline}. Of those requests, 20, representing 42%, were
either denied or elicited no response, which the State Department
considers to be denial of access (See Figure 2).

[In the agreement, each party designated an entity to serve as [the
\"competent national authority\" as the]{.mark} responsible point of
contact]{.underline} for the agreement. [The United States selected the
[U.S. Arctic Research Commission]{.mark}]{.underline}. Projecting
forward, we look forward to exercising the optimism and enthusiasm for
cooperation displayed in the effort to reach this agreement and to
facilitating research for the greater good.

b\. What constitutes production, development, exploration?

The statutory definitions of exploration, development, and production
are as follows:

> "[The [term "**exploration**" means]{.mark} the [process of

> (1) geophysical [surveys]{.mark}]{.underline} where magnetic, gravity,

It appears that the terms [["exploration" and
"development"]{.underline}]{.mark} are not as frequently litigated as
the terms "production" or "operation." Perhaps this is because these
terms [[are confined to]{.mark} the **[initial process of
discovering]{.mark} minerals**]{.underline} and the activities following
thereafter.

#### Exploration and development of the Arctic means exclusively resource exploitation

https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2023-title16/pdf/USCODE-2023-title16-chap44B-sec2461.pdf

\(3\) The term ''[development'' means any activity]{.underline},
including logistic support, [which takes place following exploration,
the purpose of which is the exploitation of specific mineral resource
deposits]{.underline}, including processing, storage, and transport
activities.

\(4\) The term ''[exploration'' means any activity]{.underline},
including logistic support, [the purpose of which is the identification
or evaluation of specific mineral resource deposits. The term includes
exploratory drilling, dredging, and other surface or subsurface
excavations]{.underline} required to determine the nature and size of
mineral resource deposits and the feasibility of their development.

The vast mineral and hydrocarbon reserves make the Alaskan Arctic
attractive for investment. However, [[**development** is
**challenged**]{.underline} [by **distance to markets**]{.underline},
**[limited infrastructure]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [costs and risks
attendant to its remoteness, challenging]{.underline}

[weather and environmental conditions and a dwindling subfreezing
season]{.underline} necessary for maintaining ice roads and conditions
suitable for safe travel and operation within the Arctic.4 [[Despite
this]{.underline}]{.mark} challenging environment,
[**[exploration]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[development]{.underline}** [investment in the **Arctic**]{.underline}
[has steadily **increased**]{.underline}]{.mark} and will continue to do
so if commodity prices remain high and Alaska remains competitive for
investment dollars.5 Alaska is in a global race to attract investment
that will open new opportunities in the Arctic.

[To encourage new capital investment and secure the benefits of new
resource development]{.underline} upon which state and local communities
depend, [Alaska and its [federal counterparts must continue to spearhead
new strategies]{.mark}]{.underline} to keep Alaska competitive. [The
state has some of the most sophisticated interagency coordination and
permitting processes in the country, with the expertise]{.underline},
experience and commitment to safely develop the Alaskan Arctic's vast
resources. With this history and experience, Alaska is well-positioned
to respond to increased resource development activity in the Arctic.

Some Alaskan Arctic communities are currently supporting **[[new
resource extraction projects]{.underline}]{.mark}**. These communities
recognize that oil, gas and mining industries offer meaningful
employment, stable cash economies and reliable municipal revenues that
support clean water, sanitation, health clinics, airports and other
infrastructure necessary for strong, safe and healthy communities. While
circumstances differ among local governments, resource development
projects often generate an influx of new revenue sources. This new
revenue has, in many cases, afforded local governments the resources to
expand emergency response and search and rescue capabilities, take an
active role in oil spill preparedness and implement meaningful measures
to protect regional ecosystems and local food sources that are critical
to a subsistence culture. Resource development also holds the potential
to increase access to affordable energy in remote communities with
staggering energy costs.

[It is imperative to **balance** new **resource
development**]{.underline} opportunities -- both on- and offshore --
[with **safeguards** that consider]{.underline} possible environmental
impacts. Although debate of potential risks to the environment and
impact on subsistence resources is contentious, dialogue that addresses
these issues is constructive and solution-oriented. This discourse
includes ensuring that rural development includes protections for
subsistence resources, cultural identity and lands, while providing
needed infrastructure, services and employment training opportunities.

[[Emerging resource development opportunities]{.mark}, newly accessible
[**maritime routes** and **public investment**]{.mark} in construction
and infrastructure [will create an increased deman]{.mark}d]{.underline}
for educational resources and skilled workforces. The state university
system, with industry and nonprofit partners, is actively engaged in
delivering quality training and meeting the needs of a future workforce.

II\. Resources and Economic Change

The [[**resources** of the **Arctic**]{.underline}, [broadly defined,
include **living resources**]{.underline}]{.mark} [such as fish, timber,
waterfowl, and mammals; [**nonrenewable resources** such as
hydrocarbons,]{.mark} metal ores, and coal; [**aesthetic resources**
such as wilderness and wildlife]{.mark}; [and **cultural**
**resources**]{.mark}]{.underline} [such as arts, dances, stories,
traditional practices and skills, and museums. **Traditional economi**es
have used many of these **resources** for **millennia**]{.underline}.
[Modern economies may combine some elements of traditional practices
with largescale resource]{.underline} [development]{.underline} and
small-scale innovations and services such as tourism (Caulfield 1997,
Condon et al. 1995, Wenzel 1995).

Large-scale [[**economic development** dates back
**centuries**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [starting with fish, furs, and
whales and eventually incorporating oil and minerals. Today, the Arctic
remains a rich source of raw natural resources, many of which interest
southern markets]{.underline}. Due to inaccessibility and lack of
infrastructure, however, in most cases only large-scale projects are
economically viable. [Large-scale [**development** entails costs for the
**Arctic**]{.mark} as well as offering]{.underline} benefits. Costs
include the potential for causing environmental, social, economic,
cultural, and political dislocation of arctic residents, among whom
traditional land and resource uses remain prevalent. To predict and
avoid such dislocation, a better understanding is needed of the
characteristics of resource extraction industries and their markets and
of the extent to which they affect local economies and cultures
(Andréeva et al. 1996, Chance and Andréeva 1995, Flanders et al. 1998).
Reviews of resource use through time as well as of past development can
offer insights into the impacts of future projects. Culture may help
northern peoples adapt to social and economic changes, and comparative
studies can help illuminate its role in determining the nature and scope
of impacts (Chance and Andréeva 1995, McGovern et al. 1996, McNabb et
al. in press).

2\. Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA)

OCSLA would regulate those methane hydrates within U.S. territorial
waters. The OCSLA provides for the recognition of the mineral assets of
the U.S. offshore in its territorial and EEZ waters. It also provides
the regulatory framework to lease those minerals.

The onset of methane hydrate development is also limited by previous
efforts to prevent offshore development of oil and gas within the U.S. A
variety of specific statutes banning offshore developments, e.g. the
North Carolina Outer Banks Protection Act, and presidential executive
moratoria have either directly prevented the leasing of areas offshore
both the West and East Coasts or have prevented budget allocations from
supporting the administrative costs of that licensing. Today, only the
areas offshore Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas are active in development
activities. 705

and economically managing methane hydrates within the U.S.\'s EEZ.

What might not be expected though, is that OCSLA provides to the
Secretary of Commerce, not the Department of the Interior or the EPA,
the duties to perform EAs on prospective and on-going methane hydrate
leases and operations. 713 Nevertheless, NEPA remains in application, as
it applies to all federal agencies. 714

In any event, such a delineation may not be sustainable considering the
third paragraph of Article I refers to States having a "freedom of
scientific investigation" and thus [the [term "**exploration**" must
have a meaning **other** than scientific research]{.mark}]{.underline}.
This is further supported by Article IX of the Outer Space Treaty, which
provides, among other requirements, that States:

This is clearly inconsistent with the proposition that "exploration" of
outer space means scientific research in outer space, as the drafters of
the Outer Space Treaty are unlikely to have repeated themselves in such
blatant fashion. Consequently, other possible definitions for the word
"exploration", vis-à-vis the meaning of the word "use", must be
contemplated. If one chose to consider the results from activities

[a [**distinction** may be drawn on]{.mark}]{.underline} the

[Ocean exploration is distinguished from research by the fact that
exploration leads to questions, while research leads to
answers]{.underline}. [When one undertakes exploration, it is **without
any preconceived notion of what one might find**]{.underline} [or **who
might benefit from the discoveries**]{.underline}. [Research, on the
other hand, is undertaken to test a certain hypothesis]{.underline},
with the clear understanding of the benefits of either supporting or
refuting the hypothesis under consideration. Often novel discoveries are
made accidentally in the process of performing hypothesis-driven
research, but with a purposeful exploration program, those discoveries
are more likely to be appreciated for what they are, properly
documented, and followed-up.

Here is a concrete example. One of the greatest surprises in
oceanography in the 20th century was the discovery of the hot-vent
communities, deep-sea oases that thrive in sea water geothermally heated
to several hundred degrees centigrade. These animals form an entire
ecosystem completely independent of the sun\'s energy, and their
existence opens up huge new possibilities for how life might be
sustained elsewhere in the universe. This discovery led to a host of new
research questions. What is the energy source for this new style of
community? How do proteins fold at such high temperatures? By what
reproductive strategy do deep-sea vent organisms manage to find and
colonize new, isolated vent systems as the old ones die? These are
important questions, but ones that we would not know enough to even ask
had the discovery not happened. And it almost didn\'t. The shipboard
party involved was entirely geologists and geophysicists. There wasn\'t
a single biologist on board to appreciate the significance of what was
to become the most important discovery in marine biology. Ever. Lacking
basic biological supplies, the geophysicists had to sacrifice all of
their vodka to preserve the novel specimens they collected.

Such discoveries don\'t need to be rare, accidental, or potentially
unappreciated with a strong, vigorous, and systematic ocean exploration
program. I created a graphic (Figure 1) to show how NOAA\'s OE program
might ideally relate to the broader ocean research agenda and to the
NURP program.

The upper box is meant to represent NOAA\'s Ocean Exploration program.
[New discoveries are made by exploring new places, and/or by deploying
new tools which \`\`see\'\' the ocean in new dimensions]{.underline}.
With roughly 95 percent of the ocean still unexplored, and new tools
that image the physics, chemistry, biology, and geology of the ocean at
all scales being developed constantly, the opportunities for discovery
are virtually limitless. The greatest strength of having a federal
organization such as NOAA leading this effort is the fact that it can
undertake a systematic, multi-disciplinary exploration of the ocean.
However, if I had to identify NOAA\'s weakness in terms of being the
lead agency for this effort, it is the fact that NOAA is not widely
known for its prowess in developing new technology. For this reason, I
support the provision in H.R. 3835 that establishes an interagency task
force which includes NASA and ONR to facilitate the transfer of new
exploration technology to the program.

#### Exploration is the study of the unknown -- research is the attempt to understand things previously discovered

**Keener, 14** -- Marine Biologist and Education Director at the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Paula, "Introduction to

**bold in original**

On August 13, 2008, the NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer was commissioned as
"America's Ship for Ocean Exploration;" the only U.S. ship whose sole
assignment is to systematically explore Earth's largely unknown ocean. A
key part of the vision underlying this assignment is that the Okeanos
Explorer is a ship of discovery. Her mission is to find anomalies;
things that are unusual and unexpected. When anomalies are found,
[explorers aboard the ship collect basic information that can guide
future expeditions to investigate hypotheses based on this information.
This process underscores an important distinction between exploration
and research:]{.underline}

[Exploration is about making new discoveries to expand our fundamental
scientific knowledge]{.underline} and understanding and to lay the
foundation for more detailed scientific investigations;

[Research is about the attempt to understand things that have previously
been discovered]{.underline} and leads to informed decision-making.

#### Exploration seeks to establish new hypotheses; research seeks to prove or disprove existing hypotheses

**Malik et al, 13 --** The Smithsonian/NASA Astrophysics Data System
("To Explore or to Research: Trends in modern age ocean studies"
American Geophysical Union, Fall Meeting 2013, abstract #OS33B-1763,
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013AGUFMOS33B1763M)

The recommendations of President\'s Panel Report on Ocean Exploration
gave rise to NOAA\'s Office of Ocean Exploration in 2001, and helped
establish NOAA as the lead agency for a federal ocean exploration
program. The panel defined exploration as discovery through disciplined,
diverse observations and recordings of findings including rigorous,
systematic observations and documentation of biological, chemical,
physical, geological, and archaeological aspects of the ocean in the
three dimensions of space and in time. Here we ask the question about
[the fine line that separates \';Exploration\' and
\';Research\']{.underline}. We contend that successful [exploration aims
to establish new lines of knowledge or give rise to new hypothesis as
compared to research where primary goal is to prove or disprove an
existing hypothesis.]{.underline} However, there can be considerable
time lag before a hypothesis can be established after an initial
observation. [This creates interesting challenges for ocean exploration
because instant \';return on investment\' can not be readily
shown]{.underline}. Strong media and public interest is garnered by far
and apart exciting discoveries about new biological species or
processes. However, most of the ocean exploration work goes to
systematically extract basic information about a previously unknown
area. We refer to this activity as baseline characterization in
providing information about an area which can support hypothesis
generation and further research to prove or disprove this hypothesis.
[Examples of such successful characterization include OER endeavors in
the Gulf of Mexico that spanned over 10 years and it provided baseline
characterization in terms of biological diversity and distribution on
basin-wide scale]{.underline}. This baseline characterization was also
conveniently used by scientists to conduct research on benthic
communities to study effects of deep water horizon incident. [More
recently similar characterization has been attempted by NOAA Ship
Okeanos Explorer]{.underline} from 2011 - 2013 field season in NE
Atlantic canyon. [This has been one of the first ever campaigns to
systematically map the NE canyons from US-Canada border t]{.underline}o
Cape Hatteras. After the 3D mapping of the canyons that included
multibeam sonar derived bathymetry and backscatter, OER provided the
first ever comprehensive maps of the seafloor and water column which
have become the basis for further exploration and research in this
region. NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer currently remains the only federal
vessel dedicated solely to Ocean Exploration. Examples of some of the
recent discoveries of the ship will be provided to explain as how
Exploration and Research are merging together in modern era of ocean
sciences.

#### Exploration is discovery, not research -- means it has to be open-ended

**NOAA, 12 --** National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office
of Ocean Exploration and Research ("Independent Review of the Ocean

http://explore.noaa.gov/sites/OER/Documents/about-oer/program-review/oe-program-history-overview.pdf)

2.1 What is Exploration?

[As described in the President's Panel Report, ocean exploration is
defined as "discovery through disciplined diverse observations and the
recording of the findings]{.underline}. [An explorer is distinguished
from a researcher by virtue of the fact that an explorer has not
narrowly designed the observing strategy to test a specific
hypothesis]{.underline}. A successful explorer leaves a legacy of new
knowledge that can be used by those not yet born to answer questions not
yet posed at the time of the exploration." [Above all, the overarching
purpose of ocean exploration is to increase our knowledge of the ocean
environment; its features, habitats, and species; and how it functions
as part of the global ecosystem.]{.underline}

In practice, [the NOAA Ocean Exploration Program adopted and continues
to promote an approach to engage teams of scientists representing
multiple disciplines to explore unknown and poorly known ocean areas and
phenomena]{.underline}. This approach also includes recruiting natural
resource managers, educators, journalists, documentary filmmakers, and
others to join expeditions and provide a unique perspective on the areas
being investigated. [The objective is to generate a comprehensive
characterization of the area and phenomena explored, providing a rich
foundation to stimulate follow-on research, as well as new lines of
scientific inquiry]{.underline}.

[[Exploration might be]{.mark} an act of [discovering an **unexplored
place** **or**]{.mark} discovering [**an unfamiliar subject**; in
both]{.mark} cases, **[an "unknown" is required]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
John Franklin sought to sail through an unknown passage; Robert Peary
and Frederick Cook tried to reach the mythic North Pole. Explorers made
the imaginary Thule real.

Depending on the era of exploration, [the principal actors in the Arctic
have changed]{.underline} over the centuries. Until the start of the
twenty-first century, traditional "explorers" acted in the Arctic.
Compared to the explorations in the previous centuries, [[contemporary
efforts to explore the Arctic originate from **oil**]{.mark} and gas
[**companies** and **scientists**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline}
[[who]{.underline}]{.mark} employ different methods and techniques and
[[have different motives for exploration]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Consequently, [[as the "unknown" elements of the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} have evolved and
[[changed]{.underline}]{.mark}, so has [[the "subject" of exploration
transformed as well.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Previous explorations leading up to the twenty-first century certainly
increased the geopolitical importance of the Arctic, as nations
developed new fishing grounds and new shipping routes. Subsequent
colonization of parts of the Arctic (Russian rule in Alaska, the Hudson
Bay Company in Canada, and the Bergen Greenland Company of Norway and
Denmark) paved the way for additional economic activities, such as fur
trading (Norman, 2018: 2).

Early economic and scientific explorations were financed by states
primarily to promote their interests in expanding their reach in the
areas of the Arctic considered terra nullius. Since then, the increasing
pressure of globalization on the nation-state system in the twenty-first
century promoted new actors in Arctic exploration, such as IGOs
(intergovernmental organizations), NGOs (non-governmental
organizations), private companies and multinational investors. Indeed,
the term "explorer" today is largely used as a metaphor, since the type
of exploration has evolved from discovering unknown territory to
developing new economic activities, such as the exploration of oil and
gas deposits by companies. In such cases, the new explorers are
companies.

[[Climate change has become]{.underline}]{.mark} one of [[the most
important]{.mark} [motive]{.mark}s [for scientific
exploration]{.mark},]{.underline} as we seek to understand the causes
and impacts of the warming Arctic[. [These explorations
are]{.mark}]{.underline} not only [[financed by
states]{.underline}]{.mark} but also by NGOs, private companies or
international organizations. Scientists, Indigenous peoples and other
Arctic residents also take part in these projects.

#### Exploration means [scientific]{.underline} or [economic]{.underline} discovery

[The nature of [exploration in the Arctic has changed]{.mark} in the
twenty-first century [because of]{.mark}]{.underline} the increasing
effects of [[climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}, which has created a
new political and economic Arctic agenda in terms of physical changes of
the ocean, easier access to oil and gas deposits, new shipping routes,
new fishing areas and growing global interest in the Arctic Council.
Climate change has also magnified the effect of globalization in the
Arctic as a new global phenomenon. Thus, the Arctic is attracting the
attention of non-Arctic world.

[During this new era in the Arctic, [scientific and economic exploration
go hand in hand]{.mark}]{.underline} for some Arctic states such as
Russia, where including scientists in economic exploration efforts is
compulsory. Scientists from Russia interviewed for this chapter indicate
that they joined several explorations with Rosneft and conducted their
own scientific research on sea ice.4 In Norway, Equinor has always
cooperated with universities and other research institutions. Ørjan
Birkeland5 says that it is expected that the industry creates
sustainable ripple effects in the societies in which they work, and this
also implies engagement of universities. Equinor has agreements and
sponsorship programs with several universities and supports research
programs in their areas of interest, such as geology and energy
distribution; sometimes the company sponsors independent research
projects of universities (e.g., from Norway, United Kingdom, Germany and
other countries). In other situations, Equinor funds research projects
to examine a specific issue that it wants to be analyzed. In these ways,
scientific involvement on the part of private companies is implemented
on different levels.6

On the other hand, oil and gas exploration involves very different
methods and means from the type of exploration undertaken in previous
times. [Modern efforts related to oil and gas development require
expertise in geology and seismology]{.underline} and in related
technological fields. Oil and gas companies must plan their explorations
years in advance, and sometimes face failure. For example, Norway
conducted an important oil exploration in Barents Sea in 2017 with
disappointing results. However, the chief executive of Statoil (by 2018
Equinor) stated that the government-controlled company was "very
patient" when it came to exploring new areas and that it would return to
the Norwegian and Barents Seas the following year with "optimism but
realism" (Milne, 2017). Indeed, Statoil resumed exploration between 2017
and 2019 in the Barents Sea, developing exploration wells in the areas
of Jøkåsen, Gjøkåsen Deep, Korpfjell Deep, Sputnik and Mist.7 The
"exploration" page of the Norwegian state-owned company Equinor's
website displays its purpose as: "Inspiration from a history of
explorers. Building on a heritage of adventurers, Equinor has become a
world-leading explorer for oil and gas."8 It is obvious that
[**[scientific exploration]{.mark}** [and **economic exploration**
methods differ greatly, but the notion of "exploration" is fundamental
in this new era]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Conducting **[science-based explorations]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
order [[to understand]{.underline}]{.mark} the how and whys of [[climate
change is necessary]{.underline}]{.mark} to mitigate its effects.
However, if the United States, as a superpower, remains unsupportive of
these kinds of scientific endeavors, it would have significant economic
and symbolic impacts. First, the conduct of long-term or short-term
[[scientific exploration in the Arctic is very expensive]{.mark} because
of the remoteness]{.underline} of the region. Therefore, [[U.S.
financial aid is crucial]{.underline}]{.mark}. Second, the contribution
and presence of one of the great powers of the Arctic symbolically
enhances the significance of scientific efforts. The Third International
Polar Year was organized in 1957 in the middle of the Cold War and
suffered from political tensions. The bipolar world of those days
undermined both eastern and western scientific effort. Ironically, in
today's multipolar era, science suffers again because of power politics.

[c[oncept]{.mark}]{.underline}s [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} their
**[[contemporary context]{.underline}]{.mark}**. What we may regard
today as a pure discovery expedition might have been viewed in the past
as advanced science.

Polar research as a specific term probably originated in Germany in the
19th century -- "Polarforschung" became a scientific discipline. Today,
however, we realize that polar research is not defined as a particular
discipline but is a geographical definition: research that is dedicated
to polar areas of the world. Typically, it is field based,
multidisciplinary, international, and very expensive. It is also typical
that polar research is motivated by more than scientific curiosity --
individual and national prestige, economic and political interests are
also important. Nonetheless, international cooperation is prevalent in
polar research.

Karl Weyprecht and Georg von Neumayer's initiative in the 1870s to
organize the first International Polar Year (1882--83) was a turning
point in making polar research more focussed on science, less on heroic
exploration and discovery. On Svalbard the Swedes manned the IPY station
at Kapp Thordsen, with great success.

The [([scientific) exploration of Svalbard may be divided into different
phases]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example:

• 1596--[[1720: First discovery, geographical
exploration]{.underline}]{.mark}, mapping

• 1720--1850: Development of natural science, North Pole expeditions

• 1850--1900: First "golden age" of Svalbard science; Swedish hegemony

• 1900--1945: Geology and land claims; Norwegian hegemony; economic
crisis

• 1945--[**[today]{.mark}**: [International

Montserrat Gorina-Ysern, American University, is an expert on the Law of
the Sea Convention (LOSC). She provided a brief background on the
regulation of fundamental oceanographic research and marine science
research as distinct from exploration in the 1958 Geneva Convention on
the Continental Shelf and the 1982 LOSC, Part XIII, respectively. She
outlined the main principles, rights and duties concerning the conduct
of marine science research in different jurisdictional maritime zones
and proposed how these would apply to IGOE activities.

["Exploration" has different meanings for different purposes (i.e.,
marine science research versus discovery of natural
resources]{.underline}). The definition problem is compounded because
[marine science research has not been defined in LOSC]{.underline}. IOC
has defined marine science research as referring to the scientific
investigation of the ocean, its biota and its physical boundaries with
the solid Earth and the atmosphere. [The results of marine science
research]{.underline}, normally published in journals of international
circulation, [are said to benefit humankind at large; whereas,
exploration]{.underline} [(also referred to as applied research) is
concerned with ocean resources, and the results of this type of research
are considered to be the property of the persons, corporations, or
governments initiating the research]{.underline}.

#### Arctic exploration means [discovery of the unknown]{.underline} -- that's either [research]{.underline} or [resources]{.underline}

[[Exploration might be]{.mark} an act of [discovering an **unexplored
place** **or**]{.mark} discovering [**an unfamiliar subject**; in
both]{.mark} cases, **[an "unknown" is required]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
John Franklin sought to sail through an unknown passage; Robert Peary
and Frederick Cook tried to reach the mythic North Pole. Explorers made
the imaginary Thule real.

Depending on the era of exploration, [the principal actors in the Arctic
have changed]{.underline} over the centuries. Until the start of the
twenty-first century, traditional "explorers" acted in the Arctic.
Compared to the explorations in the previous centuries, [[contemporary
efforts to explore the Arctic originate from **oil**]{.mark} and gas
[**companies** and **scientists**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline}
[[who]{.underline}]{.mark} employ different methods and techniques and
[[have different motives for exploration]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Consequently, [[as the "unknown" elements of the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} have evolved and
[[changed]{.underline}]{.mark}, so has [[the "subject" of exploration
transformed as well.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Previous explorations leading up to the twenty-first century certainly
increased the geopolitical importance of the Arctic, as nations
developed new fishing grounds and new shipping routes. Subsequent
colonization of parts of the Arctic (Russian rule in Alaska, the Hudson
Bay Company in Canada, and the Bergen Greenland Company of Norway and
Denmark) paved the way for additional economic activities, such as fur
trading (Norman, 2018: 2).

Early economic and scientific explorations were financed by states
primarily to promote their interests in expanding their reach in the
areas of the Arctic considered terra nullius. Since then, the increasing
pressure of globalization on the nation-state system in the twenty-first
century promoted new actors in Arctic exploration, such as IGOs
(intergovernmental organizations), NGOs (non-governmental
organizations), private companies and multinational investors. Indeed,
the term "explorer" today is largely used as a metaphor, since the type
of exploration has evolved from discovering unknown territory to
developing new economic activities, such as the exploration of oil and
gas deposits by companies. In such cases, the new explorers are
companies.

[[Climate change has become]{.underline}]{.mark} one of [[the most
important]{.mark} [motive]{.mark}s [for scientific
exploration]{.mark},]{.underline} as we seek to understand the causes
and impacts of the warming Arctic[. [These explorations
are]{.mark}]{.underline} not only [[financed by
states]{.underline}]{.mark} but also by NGOs, private companies or
international organizations. Scientists, Indigenous peoples and other
Arctic residents also take part in these projects.

#### Exploration is the first stage of research

**National Research Council, 3 -** Committee on Exploration of the Seas,
Ocean Studies Board, Division on Earth and Life Studies, National
Research Council (Exploration of the Seas: Voyage into the Unknown, p.
17)

As defined by the President\'s Panel on Ocean Exploration (National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2000), [exploration is discovery
through disciplined, diverse observations and the recording of findings.
Ocean exploration has included rigorous, systematic observation and
documentation of the biological, chemical, physical, geological and
archaeological aspects of the ocean]{.underline} in the three dimensions
of space and in time. [This definition of exploration is much broader
than the definition one would find]{.underline}, for example, [within
the context for the extractive industries, where exploration is a search
for hydrocarbon or mineral deposits]{.underline}. More general
approaches allow researchers to develop and ask questions that are not
rooted in specific hypotheses and that often lead to unexpected
answers--- a difficult task to promote within the current approaches to
research funding.

[Exploration is an early component of the research process; it focuses
on new areas of inquiry and develops descriptions of phenomena that
inform the direction of further study]{.underline}. [It is the
collection of basic observations that later allow hypotheses to be posed
to connect those observations with the laws of physics, chemistry, and
biology]{.underline}. In some disciplines, such as physics, exploration
has been pursued aggressively, and the resources are best invested in
testing hypotheses and conducting controlled experiments. In other
disciplines, the system under investigation is so vast, complex, or
remote that exploration is still the necessary first step. Outer space,
the human genome, and the oceans are excellent examples. This nation and
others have invested heavily in the exploration of outer space and the
functioning of the human genome, and each program has both captured the
imagination of the public and produced tangible, valuable discoveries.
No similar systematic program exists for ocean exploration, despite its
promise.

In June 2000, a panel of experts from the ocean science community was
convened to fulfill a presidential request to provide recommendations
for a national ocean exploration strategy (National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, 2000). In October, [the President's Panel on
Ocean Exploration recommended that the United States add a national
program of ocean exploration to its current marine research
portfolio]{.underline} (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
2000). That program would provide the opportunity to explore the Earth's
oceans through broad-based observations and through interdisciplinary
and cross-cultural investigations. The panel's vision was to "not only
go where no one has ever gone, but to 'see' the oceans through a new set
of technological 'eyes,' and record those journeys for posterity"
(National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2000).

### Exploration/Development\-\--CI Not Only Minerals\-\--2AC

University and RAND Graduate Student Fellow; Journal of Geovisualization
and Spatial Analysis"Visualizing Convergent Pressures on Arctic
Development," vol. 8, no. 36\]

These three themes---**[[climate]{.underline}]{.mark}** change, natural
**[[resource extraction]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [and
tourism]{.underline}---[[constitute a small subset of a
multitude]{.mark} of economic, political, and environmental pressures
shaping Arctic development in complex]{.underline}, often competing
ways. Accordingly, "[**[development]{.underline}**" [itself is a
**contested concept**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the region, implicitly
evoking a range of processes spanning from colonialist capital
accumulation to preserving traditional Indigenous lifeways. As numerous
scholars have noted (e.g., Bennett 2016; Veland & Lynch 2017; Graybill
and Petrov 2020), the nature of the intersections of these pressures on
development is explicitly spatial. Development always occurs (or fails
to occur) somewhere, driven (or inhibited) by a confluence of enabling
(or constraining) factors ranging from global to local that converge on
a particular location. Identifying places with potential for a specific
mode of development thus becomes, partially, an exercise in locating and
characterizing convergences in pre-existing factors that tell a story of
past and present development through a modal lens.

[Development centered on resource extraction in the
**Arctic**]{.underline}, for example, [would depend on the presence of
**raw materials**]{.underline} (e.g., hard [**[minerals]{.underline}**,
**[oil]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [and **[gas]{.mark}**]{.underline}) [[and
could be facilitated by **infrastructure**]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g.,
**[[pipelines]{.underline}]{.mark}**), [a robust
**[transportation]{.mark} network**]{.underline} (e.g., seaports,
railways, roads), [and other amenities]{.underline} (e.g., healthcare
facilities, schools/[universities) to enable the import/export of
inputs/outputs as well as to attract and retain a skilled
workforce]{.underline} (Myllylä et al. 2016[). Even so, [such factors
are only incomplete indicators of **development
potential**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Resource extraction may justify the
need for novel accessways where few roads exist, and a limited range of
amenities in remote communities may underrepresent fluctuations in human
presence by a transient workforce.

A comprehensive examination of the development potential of a location
typically involves fieldwork-informed case study analysis (e.g.,
Pashkevich et al. 2016). However, an initial screening of sites based on
a small number of critical enabling/constraining factors is possible
through mapping and spatial analysis. Despite the recent proliferation
of publicly available geospatial data, thematic mapping of development
indicators as an analytical technique has tended to focus on a single
variable or metric, whether relating to human presence directly (e.g.,
population change as in Heleniak 2021) or to second-order effects of
human activity (e.g., urban night lights, as in Morshed et al. 2022).

### Exploration\-\--CI\-\--2AC

#### Any [attempt]{.underline} to [push the boundaries]{.underline} of [what society knows]{.underline} through intervening in a [physical space]{.underline} is [exploration]{.underline}.

**Brett '18** \[Annie and Kenneth Broad; 2018; J.D., PhD, University of
Miami; Director of the Abess Center and Professor of Marine Ecosystems
and Society at University of Miami and the National Geographic Explorer
of the Year; Villanova Law Review, "The Litigation of Exploration," 63
Vill. L. Rev. 241\]

However, this is not dispositive. Exploration uniquely occurs at the
limits of human experience and ability. At these limits, our laws are
tested in ways that we don\'t necessarily see in any other field.
Exploration thus is a fantastic, and underutilized, lens to explore risk
and responsibility in our society, as well as the role of the law in
limiting or allowing boundary-pushing activities. Many explorers blame
the legal system for limiting behaviors that they would like to engage
in - are these limitations reasonable given the potential societal
costs?

Moreover, understanding the litigation of exploration allows us to
better understand exploration itself. [The intersections of the legal
system and exploration over time are an invaluable tool in illustrating
what exploration is and what it means]{.underline}. Legal analysis gives
insight into the problems that explorers are faced with and how this
influences their behavior (and ultimately the societal goods that they
provide). The increase in litigation recently provides an insight into
what the future of exploration may look like. Exploration remains a
relatively unstudied academic area, despite the major theoretical and
practical outcomes of expeditions. Here, we subject exploration to legal
analysis both to better understand exploration itself and to gain
insight into how litigation shapes our regime of exploration.

First, however, [it is important to briefly delineate what exploration
is and how it differs from other related activities]{.underline}
(extreme sports, adventure travel, etc.). Developing a definition for
exploration is not an easy task. There are some things that culturally
we agree are clear examples of exploration: Columbus sailing to discover
the new world, Ponce de Leon \[\*246\] searching for the fountain of
youth, Magellan circumnavigating the globe. But does exploration include
someone using a GoPro to film themselves running whitewater on a remote
river? Was Jane Goodall exploring when she conducted research on chimps
in Africa? 28 Are children investigating the inhabitants of their yard
with a magnifying glass exploring?

Colloquially, it wouldn\'t be out of place to describe any of these
people as \"exploring.\" This fits with [the general dictionary
definition of exploration as \"to travel in a region previously unknown
or little known in order to learn about its natural features,
inhabitants,]{.underline} etc.\" 29 [This broad definition can encompass
many different activities]{.underline} - [from purely personal
exploration]{.underline} ([discovering something unfamiliar to yourself)
to exploration with huge societal]{.underline}
[implications]{.underline} ([discovering something **unfamiliar** to
**mankind**]{.underline}) and is in line with the diverse roles and
cultures of exploration historically. 30 Geographer Felix Driver, one of
the few academics whose studies have focused on exploration, notes that
\"far from being a homogenous field, the culture of exploration was
riven with differences over the style, methods and function of the
explorer.\" 31

However, in coming to his own definition of exploration [Driver
incorporates an additional clarifying element, newness]{.underline}:
\"[exploration was conceived of as a particular kind of travel
associated with the sight of new landscapes, peoples, plants and
animals]{.underline}.\" 32 [He further clarifies this newness as laying
\"eyes upon a lake, a peak, a species, for the first
time]{.underline}.\" 33 [This definition **narrows** the **field of
reference**]{.underline} [for exploration]{.underline}: [the things
being explored must not just be unfamiliar to the explorer, but **new**
to **society** as a **whole**]{.underline}. National Geographic concurs
with this definition, describing exploration in a 125-year retrospective
as \"**[pushing beyond the]{.underline}** **[boundaries]{.underline}**
[of what is **known**]{.underline}, [seeking **new territories** and new
**opportunities**]{.underline}.\" 34 [This is the **exploration** this
Article is concerned with and the **definition** that we will use
here]{.underline}. Within this definition of exploration, there are
several major subcategories of exploration. Understanding these helps to
characterize the field and set the stage for a legal analysis, but also
helps to understand how exploration has evolved over time.

Executive Summary

The United States seeks an Arctic region that is peaceful, stable,
prosperous, and cooperative. The National Strategy for the Arctic Region
articulates an affirmative U.S. agenda over the next ten years, from
2022 to 2032, to realize this vision. This strategy, an update of its
2013 predecessor, addresses the climate crisis with greater urgency and
directs new investments in sustainable development to improve
livelihoods for Arctic residents, while conserving the environment. It
also acknowledges increasing strategic competition in the Arctic since
2013, exacerbated by Russia's unprovoked war in Ukraine, and seeks to
position the United States to both effectively compete and manage
tensions.

Realizing our vision during this dynamic and challenging period will
require U.S. leadership at home and abroad. We will advance U.S.
interests across four mutually reinforcing pillars spanning both
domestic and international issues.

• **[[Pillar 1---Security]{.underline}]{.mark}**: We will deter threats
to the U.S. homeland and our allies by enhancing the capabilities
required to defend our interests in the Arctic, while coordinating
shared approaches with allies and partners and mitigating risks of
unintended escalation. We will exercise U.S. government presence in the
Arctic region as required to protect the American people and defend our
sovereign territory.

• [Pillar 2---**[Climate Change]{.mark}**]{.underline} and Environmental
Protection: The U.S. government will partner with Alaskan communities
and the State of Alaska to build resilience to the impacts of climate
change, while working to reduce emissions from the Arctic as part of
broader global mitigation efforts, to improve scientific understanding,
and to conserve Arctic ecosystems.

• Pillar 3---Sustainable **[[Economic
Development]{.underline}]{.mark}**: We will pursue sustainable
development and improve livelihoods in Alaska, including for Alaska
Native communities, [[by investing in
infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[improving access to
services]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and supporting growing economic
sectors]{.underline}]{.mark}. We will also work with allies and partners
to expand high- standard investment and sustainable development across
the Arctic region.

• [Pillar 4---**[International Cooperation]{.mark}** and
Governance]{.underline}: Despite the challenges to Arctic cooperation
resulting from Russia's aggression in Ukraine, the United States will
work to sustain institutions for Arctic cooperation, including the
Arctic Council, and position these institutions to manage the impacts of
increasing activity in the region. We also seek to uphold international
law, rules, norms, and standards in the Arctic.

[[This strategy is intended to serve as a framework to guide the U.S.
government's approach to]{.underline}]{.mark} tackling emerging
challenges and opportunities in **[[the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Our work will be guided by five principles that will be applied across
all four pillars.

II\. SEPARATION OF POWERS IN ALASKA\'S NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT

A. Constitutional Natural Resource \[\*\*4\] Policy And Framework ---
Article VIII

It was widely recognized that the Alaska Territory\'s future success as
a state would depend upon natural resource development.4 Statehood bills
pending during the Constitutional Convention contemplated transferring
\[\*783\] to the proposed state substantial federal land, subsurface
mineral rights, and the authority to manage fish and wildlife.5 The
convention delegates \"sought to enshrine in the state constitution the
principle that the resources of Alaska must be managed for the long-run
benefit of the people as a whole.\"6 Rather than developing a detailed
constitutional code governing resource management,7 the delegates sought
to protect the long-term viability of Alaska\'s natural resources from
\"the indifference or avarice of future generations\" by fixing \"the
general concept of the public interest\" in both Alaska law and \"the
consciousness of Alaskans.\"8 The delegates incorporated concepts such
as \"common use\"9 and \"sustained yield\"10 to promote \"a harmonious
balance between consumption, preservation, and expansion of natural
resources.\"11 They further protected the public interest by requiring
public notice and development of statutory guidelines for state property
\[\*\*5\] disposals.12

Article VIII, sections 1 and 2 of the Alaska Constitution express
[[Alaska\'s resource development]{.underline}]{.mark} \[\*784\]
[[policy]{.underline}]{.mark} and direct the legislature to implement
it:

Section 1. Statement of Policy. [It is the policy of the State to
encourage the settlement of its land and the development of its
resources by making them available for maximum use consistent with the
public interest]{.underline}.13 \[Footnote 13\] See Harrison, supra note
4, at 131 (\"[This is an emphatic statement that [the policy of the
state is to encourage the **development** of its **land**
and]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[resources]{.underline}**,]{.mark} [but in a
manner that recognizes the collective interests of the people as the
owners of these lands and resources]{.underline}.\"); see also McBeath,
supra note 11, at 159 (\"Delegates to the constitutional convention were
uniform in their belief that Alaska\'s natural resources had been
\'locked up\' and devalued by the negligent actions of the federal
government and absentee owners . . . . Thus, the delegates were
committed to the maximum development of Alaska\'s resources. However,
they hedged their need to exploit resources with the requirement that
resource use was a public trust.\"). \[End Footnote 13\]

Section 2. General Authority. [The legislature shall provide for
the]{.underline} utilization, [development]{.underline}, and
conservation [of all natural resources belonging to the State, including
land and waters, for the maximum benefit of its people]{.underline}.14
\[Footnote 14\] 14See Harrison, supra note 4, at 131 (\"This section is
a broad grant of legislative authority to implement the policy
enunciated in Section 1 . . . . In addition to utilization and
development, conservation appears as an objective of resource
management. The delegates understood the term in its traditional sense
of \'wise use.\' \"); McBeath \[\*\*6\] , supra note 11, at 159 (stating
that delegates \"were influenced by the modern principles of resource
conservation and use, such as sustained yield and multiple use, which
they made the constitutional objectives for all resource policy

public interest\' \" (quoting AlaskaConst. art. VIII, §1)); see also

The term \"develop\" is not defined in the statute, and there is a
dearth of case law on the subject. In the \"absence of statutory
guidance as to the meaning of a particular term, it is appropriate to
look to its dictionary definition in order to discern its meaning in a
given context.\" Connecticut v. Clifton Owens, 100 Conn. App. 619, 639,
918 A.2d 1041 (2007). There are various definitions of the term
\"develop,\" some of which connote commercial and industrial progress,
and some of which imply natural growth. See BLACK\'S LAW DICTIONARY 462

the definition of \"**develop**\"]{.underline} must have a [natural,

Congress intended the CZMA to balance
**[[conservation]{.underline}]{.mark}** of environmental resources with
commercial development in the coastal zone. See, e.g., COASTAL AND OCEAN

\"**[develop]{.mark}**\" [has been defined to mean **commercial

of uses of the coastal zones, including economic development).

New/Emerging Trends of Arctic States

1\) State domination. The Arctic States dominate Arctic geopolitics and
governance, and play a crucial role in controlling the region. The new
Arctic dynamics has been influenced by the involvement of Indigenous
peoples and their demands, which has put human and social issues on the
agenda, and by the visibly growing interest of non-Arctic states in the
future of the Arctic. This is based on the high level of geopolitical
stability and constructive cooperation---in this context, even the
Ukrainian conflict has had very limited impact on Arctic cooperation.
Thus, the Arctic has become 'exceptional' in world politics, with State
sovereignty firmly legitimized.

On the other hand, the intention of Arctic States to dominate in the
region is due to globalization and rapidly advancing climate change,
which means better access to Arctic resources and better chances for
economic activities and development. However, this does not necessarily
mean that there is a willingness yet to adopt globalization per se into
national Arctic policies---there is more of an interest in accepting a
transformation of the Arctic Council from being the leading regional
council to becoming a leading international one.

development**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Although the [**Arctic States** are
searching for a balance between]{.mark} environmental [**protection**
and economic activities]{.mark}, and proclaim that there must be such a
balance, there is ambivalence [when it comes to]{.mark}
environmental]{.underline} **[[protection]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[versus]{.mark} economic **[development]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Climate change]{.underline}---due to rapid changes in fragile

economic activities in the public and private [sectors]{.underline}.
There are environmental initiatives, as well as small steps, such as
protected areas and legally binding agreements under the auspices of the
Arctic Council, such as the SAR and Oil Spill agreements.

Although one of the narratives mentioned is environmental protection and
implementation of sustainability, neither stricter environmental
regulations nor an 'Arctic Treaty' are preferred by the Arctic States.
It is thus not surprising that most of the States focus their economic
activities on the extractive resources (e.g., mining, energy). Tourism,
which is not reflected in most of the policies has also been on the
increase. This has created an overall sense that infrastructure
development should support economic activities, especially in the
shipping industry (in spite of safety concerns).

#### They can take actions towards marine preservation but it has to be in the context of [increasing exploitation]{.underline} of resources

Development, Government of India Ocean Engineering Centre, Indian
Institute of Technology ("IOC-Unesco Regional Training Workshop on Ocean
Engineering and Its Interface with Ocean Sciences in the Indian Ocean
Region" http://www.jodc.go.jp/info/ioc_doc/Training/085239eo.pdf)

[The term \"ocean development\" has often been used to denote all
activities, including ocean sciences, ocean engineering and related
marine technology, directed to resource exploration and exploitation and
the use of ocean space]{.underline}. [The underlying guiding principle
in all these activities has been that these be conducted in a manner
that insure the preservation of the marine environment]{.underline}
without detriment to its quality and the resources with which it
abounds. From the statements given by the participants, it became
apparent that in some countries, such as China, Indonesia, India,
Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand, ocean development programmes and
activities, over the years, have evolved from fisheries oriented needs
towards mineral resources exploitation. In some of these countries
exploitation of these resources has brought about new adjustments to
their priority needs which have progressively involved the strengthening
of their marine scientific and technological capability demanded by
these new situations.

the Earth Summit, nations agreed to implement Agenda 21, a global plan
of action for sustainable development.77 [The concept of sustainable
development incorporates environmental protection and restoration into
the definition of development]{.underline}. [The idea is to work toward
**both** conventional development and environmental protection,
**instead of** making progress in conventional development at the
environment\'s expense or **only** protecting the
environment]{.underline}.

#### Development requires commercial resource expansion

**Byron, 88 -** Neil Byron, Department of Forestry, Australian National
University (Asian-Pacif ic Economic Literature Vol. 2, No. 1, (March
19881, pp. 46-80, Wiley Online)

[The notion of harnessing more of un-utilized]{.underline} or
under-utilized [resources is]{.underline} generally [implicit in any
definition of \'development\'. Thus the thrust of many development
agencies is to expand sectors of the economy in which such slack
resources exist]{.underline}, particularly by incorporation into the
world economy through trade. [Characteristic examples are]{.underline}
plantation estates (of rubber, tea, coffee, etc), [export-oriented
fisheries]{.underline}, mining and forestry development programs, all
utilizing indigenous labour, land and natural resources, plus foreign
capital, typically to produce primary commodities for world markets. It
is within this context that many of the resource and environmental
issues reported in the Asian-Pacific region, have arisen.

#### Sustainable development makes the topic bidirectional

SIDS expect Rio+20 to provide support for [sustainable ocean
development]{.underline} and protection of resources. Measures [could
include actions to reduce fishing overcapacity, to establish MPAs,
enhance and support local coastal management efforts]{.underline},
improve wastewater treatment as well as solid waste management and
recycling. Significantly, capacity development could take place through
SIDS-SIDS partnerships based on the sharing and consolidation of unique
SIDS approaches to coastal management; such as the Pacific Locally
Managed Marine Areas (LMMA) network, the recognition and transmission of
local and indigenous knowledge and customary management of the coastal
environment, and community participation in scientific coastal
monitoring, management and decision-making as practiced in UNESCO's
Sandwatch programme.

Capabilities

Budget constraints, however, will prevent large-scale acquisition of
military equipment designed for the Arctic. There are just too many
competing demands on the defense budget. A handful of modern icebreakers
and limited numbers of the Army's new cold-weather vehicle may be the
extent of new, manned Arctic capabilities funded for the foreseeable
future. That said, the United States could shift cold-weather-capable
equipment to the region, especially unmanned intelligence, surveillance,
and reconnaissance platforms. Unmanned capabilities need not have been
developed for the Arctic per se but could be adapted for use in the
region.

[[There is a role for the U.S. private sector in **developing**
Arctic]{.mark} capabilities and **[infrastructure]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[if given the right government
**inducement**]{.mark}**s**]{.underline}. [[One promising area is
satellite communication]{.underline}]{.mark} and positioning systems.
Satellite [companies are potentially attractive government partners. The
U.S. military is looking into private-sector efforts such as the OneWeb
and Starlink polar communication satellites]{.underline}. The European
Space Agency is doing the same with Arctic weather satellites. There is
no reason these initiatives could not be expanded.

[The Biden administration's [**Arctic** strategy should consider the
role of extractive industries]{.mark}]{.underline} ([oil, mining,
timber, fishing) in the region]{.underline}. [Those industries have
built much of the nonmilitary infrastructure in Alaska. In the future,
as the global economy shifts from hydrocarbons to green energy,
government [efforts to foster **infrastructure
development**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[could focus on]{.mark} distributed
**electricity [grids]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[[port]{.mark}
facilitie[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[and]{.mark} overland
[freight]{.mark} transport]{.underline} [[associated with]{.mark}
**mineral extraction**]{.underline} (particularly **[[rare earth
minerals]{.underline}]{.mark}**) rather than on oil and gas. All are
consistent with the Biden climate plan. [New ports and rail lines could
be [funded through **cost**-**sharing** agreements between the
government and business]{.mark}, which could make **infrastructure**
cost-effective for business while saving the taxpayer
money.]{.underline} [The **private sector** could use the
**infrastructure** during **normal times**]{.underline}, [with the U.S.
military having priority use during military exercises or national
emergencies.]{.underline}

Political Will

Demonstrating the political will to use Arctic capabilities unilaterally
or in conjuncture with allies and partners is the other prerequisite for
successful deterrence and defense. The most important priority should be
to convince allies that the United States is a reliable security
partner. Some of that persuasion has already begun with the Biden
administration's reaffirmation of the U.S. commitment to NATO's Article
5 security guarantees and Blinken's consultations in Denmark before the
May 2021 Arctic Council ministerial meeting.

Persuading allies also requires demonstrating the ability to come to
their defense if needed, regardless of climate conditions. Unilateral,
bilateral, and "mini-multilateral" military exercises are all useful as
practice and as international signals in the Arctic. Unilaterally, the
U.S. Army is starting to relearn how to operate in the Arctic, as
highlighted in its Arctic strategy. The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps
learned important lessons from NATO's Trident Juncture exercise in 2018
and smaller exercises since then. More exercises are needed to
demonstrate to friend and foe alike that the U.S. military can again
operate in cold climates.

In addition, **[[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[should expand]{.underline} **[its
use]{.underline}** [of flexible basing and **deployment** agreements
with allies]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The recent agreement covering the
U.S. military's use of the Ramsund naval facility and Evenes air base in
northern Norway are a good start. A similar arrangement could be made
for the Danish air force to have permanent facilities at the U.S. base
in Thule,]{.underline} Greenland, for search and rescue, air
surveillance, anti-submarine warfare, and air interdiction missions,
something that could tie allied forces more closely together, better
defend this early warning facility, and improve surveillance in the
Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom gap. Expansion of the runway and
facilities on Norway's Jan Mayen island and refurbishing an additional
airfield in Greenland in conjunction with the Danes could serve similar
purposes. Finally, [the United States could coordinate existing niche
capabilities amongst Arctic allies, an]{.underline} Arctic version of
NATO's Connected Forces Initiative.

Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and Bureau of Safety and
Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), and federal interagency coordinating

Alaska. We chose these site visits based on a variety of criteria,
including geographic location in the state, number of interviews to be
conducted, infrastructure activity, cultural considerations, and
recommendations from stakeholders. During these site visits, we
collected relevant documentation and interviewed a range of U.S. Arctic
stakeholders such as officials from state and local government agencies,
and representatives from Alaska Native organizations, Alaska Native
corporations, 4 academic and research institutions, and companies. We
also reviewed relevant documentation and interviewed representatives
from other U.S. Arctic stakeholders such as engineering entities,
environmental groups, and industry associations and companies. The
results of these interviews are not generalizable, but do provide
insights regarding current and planned-maritime activities in the U.S.
Arctic. We reviewed prior GAO reports on several topics, including our
body of work on Arctic issues and interagency collaboration. To describe
what is known about commercial activity in the U.S. Arctic, we
interviewed companies and industry trade associations from the
commercial-shipping, cruise, commercial-fishing, oil, and mining
industries. To describe actions federal, state, and local government
entities have taken in support of the U.S. Arctic marine transportation
system, we interviewed and collected documentation from 7 federal, 10
state, and 6 local government entities to identify infrastructure within
the scope of responsibility for each entity. We also identified specific
efforts each entity has taken related to mapping, ports, port
connectors, weather and sea-ice data, polar icebreakers, and aids to
navigation. To describe federal interagency efforts taken to identify
and prioritize Arctic maritime infrastructure investments, we reviewed a
key federal government report and prior GAO reports on several topics
including our body of work on Arctic issues and interagency
collaboration. See appendix I for additional information on our scope

### Development\-\--Context/Precision Key\-\--2AC/1AR

#### Development lacks precise meaning

**Saku '10** \[James; 2010; Department of Geography, Frostburg State
University; Geography Research Forum, "Development Theory and the
Canadian North," vol. 30\]

The term [development has no precise meaning and accepted
definition]{.underline}. Hoggart and Buller (1987, 18) noted that "[when
commentators]{.underline} speak or [write about development,
they]{.underline} frequently [mean very different things ... what
development actually is, is a personal evaluation\".]{.underline}
Similarly, Black (1991) indicated that [development]{.underline} is a
user-friendly term and therefore [has]{.underline} virtually [as many
potential meanings as potential users.]{.underline}

Development is narrowly perceived by some as economic growth. Todaro
(1989) for example, indicated that development means the capacity of a
region to generate and sustain an annual increase in its Gross National
Product (GNP) at a rate of more than 5 percent. This definition equates
development with increase in GNP. Apart from economic growth,
development also involves other aspects of human life (Lele 1975). It
includes positive changes in the demographic, social, and political
characteristics of a society or region. For example, among others, a
region or country experiencing development would experience improvements
in health, education and housing, changes that may be partly attributed
to economic growth but development is a multi-dimensional process of
societal change. These changes usually occur over a period of time.

[Institutions]{.underline} such as the World Bank, the IMF and the WTO
continued to [bow to the idea of development-as-growth,
while]{.underline} the UN Development Programme, UN Environment
Programme and most [NGOs emphasized the idea of development-as-social

glue, which could refer to the building of airports just as much as to
the drilling of waterholes]{.underline}. The Millennium Development

legacy.

V. Application of Impact Categories Analysis to Consultation in Arctic
Contexts

Part IV has identified a number of different impact categories that are
pertinent to the analysis of consultation with and participation by
Arctic Indigenous communities in energy-related resource development.
The diversity of the Arctic, a large region of the Earth, has rapidly
multiplied the number of these impact categories such that it will not
be possible to analyze the application of the Part III principles to
each of the Part IV impact categories individually within this Article.
However, Part IV impact categories nonetheless pattern the application
of the Part III principles. They also allow for a more detailed comment
on the practices of Arctic states described in Part II. 392

One key division in Part IV was between [[marine and terrestrial
contexts]{.underline}]{.mark}, with energy development posing much more
significant issues in marine contexts. 393 Indeed, Indigenous rights in
marine contexts have generally received relatively little attention. 394
Thus, one innovative point immediately arising from this Article is that
the circumstances of \[\*505\] Arctic Indigenous peoples point to a real
need for detailed research on Indigenous rights in marine contexts,
quite possibly drawing upon literatures in some states that have engaged
more with those issues, such as Australia. 395

In the meantime, Arctic states should continue to try to find ways of
involving Indigenous communities in decisions affecting marine contexts
pertinent to the particular Indigenous communities. Their differing
relationships with various Indigenous communities may imply differences
between states. For example, to the extent that Saami cultural practices
relate much more to reindeer husbandry than to marine food sources or
practices, it may be justifiable in certain respects that the Nordic
Saami Convention does not seek to involve the Saami into offshore energy
development issues. 396 On the other hand, where certain Inuit
communities in Canada have very close relations to marine resources,
Canada has even negotiated one marine \"land claims\" treaty. 397 But
Canadian law on Indigenous rights in marine contexts is extremely
underdeveloped, and the relation of Inuit communities to marine
resources implies the need for further work in this area. Similar
considerations would very likely apply to Alaskan communities that have
whaling practices or make other uses of marine resources. 398

The impact categories discussed in Part IV also serve as a (partial) set
of categories to help identify possible general impacts on matters like
marine impacts that might not have been first within contemplation. 399
Therefore, it is important, pursuant to the principles addressed in Part
III, to consider how severe the potential impacts of a development
project are on Indigenous interests. The categories can help to
schematize different possible impacts with those matters of most
pertinence varying in different parts of the Arctic. 400

Therefore, Arctic states should pursue the ongoing development of
consultation and participation frameworks that enable consideration of
those impact categories that are most pertinent within their regions of
the Arctic. Some of the differences between state frameworks are
explicable in terms of these differing impact categories. However, an
application of the principled framework of Part III to the impact
categories of Part IV also highlights areas where there is room for
improvement in particular \[\*506\] state practices. For example, the
Russian Federation, in grappling with a vast and differing geographic
region of the Arctic, 401 as well as a vast number of different ethnic
groups, 402 has developed only relatively informal consultation
mechanisms. 403 While the circumstances of operating across many
different impact categories in a variety of different ways make the
development of more formal frameworks obviously challenging, there are
real dangers in an informal system. The key danger is that Russia may
have positive intentions and good law on the books, but
operationalization of this law in terms of actual consultation and
participation outcomes for Indigenous communities will be lacking. 404

[Ongoing policy development is pertinent]{.underline} even in states
with existing policies. Scandinavian states, like Norway, have different
impact categories that are [[most pertinent]{.underline}]{.mark} to
their Indigenous communities. The ongoing developments around the Nordic
Saami Convention 405 present an opportunity to ensure respect for Saami
communities. The developments [[take into account impacts
of]{.underline}]{.mark} [[**different sorts** of
**development**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[which may not
be]{.underline}]{.mark} as **[[related]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to
**energy development**]{.underline}]{.mark} as [in the context of Arctic
Indigenous peoples in other Arctic states]{.underline}. 406 The
description of Greenland in Part II alluded to a place on the possible
cusp of development, with possibly significant energy development ahead.
407 Greenland has the opportunity to ensure that appropriate policies
are in place in advance of this development, and it should actively seek
to develop appropriate policies for the impact categories most pertinent
to its Indigenous communities.

Canada has established a number of different frameworks for its
different Indigenous communities. 408 That may be a reasonable choice in
the context of different Indigenous communities spread across a vast
Arctic region with very different circumstances and with practices
falling into different impact categories. As discussed, the need for
further articulation and development of Indigenous marine rights issues
has not received much attention in Canada thus far. As energy
development continues, \[\*507\] Canada should generally monitor closely
whether its set of different arrangements is successful in addressing
the issues associated with consultation and participation.

The United States, in the context of Alaska, should consider whether the
participation aspects of its policy framework have left sufficient room
for consultation on future energy development. The articulation in
recent years of further consultation norms 409 certainly works in the
direction of consultation, but there is further work to be done in this
area. The impact categories in this Article can help identify a number
of areas in which there may be needs for consultation as Alaska further
develops.

### Development\-\--Includes Conservation\-\--2AC-1AR

#### Conservation efforts are development -- they allow more sustained use of resources

Montpellier (Gilbert, [Ecology and Management of Coastal Waters: The
Aquatic Environment]{.underline}, p. 3-4)

1.3 DEFINITIONS OF COASTAL DEVELOPMENT

[[In ecological terms, development is defined as the organisation of a
space by modifying an ecosystem in order to exploit it,]{.mark} or the
creation of habitats with a view to encouraging reproduction or settling
of particular species]{.underline} (Parent, 1990). Thus, pastoral, rural
or forestry developments have become well known on land and involve the
development and careful exploitation of natural resources with respect
to the environment, since development also requires judicious
organisation. [The development of]{.underline} European [coastal
waters]{.underline} which is aimed first at animal and, to a lesser
degree, at plant resources can be defined in the same way. This
[consists of the application of scientific and technical principles and
concepts to animal or plant populations, as well as to their habitats,
with a view to encouraging the reproduction or settling of particular
species or ensuring their healthy survival]{.underline}. These aims are
of no direct benefit to man, whereas those of land management concern
human ecology and are defined as the organisation of space so as to
improve living conditions for populations, to develop economic
activities and to develop natural resources while avoiding disturbance
of natural ecosystems (Parent, 1990). According to Lamotte (1985), the
concept of [[development consists of the
transformation]{.underline}]{.mark} by man [[of a
system]{.underline}]{.mark}---extending to the land, productivity, or
some complex combination of these---[[with a view to more rational or
efficient utilisation of resources]{.underline}]{.mark}; he added that
it involves an activity which is essential to human society \... man\'s
objective is to free himself from the constraints of the functioning of
natural ecosystems in which he evolves and which he transforms. The
coastal domain is not very well defined; in France, it is considered to
be a zone approximately 40 km on either side of the water\'s edge
(Anon., 1994). Coastal waters thus extend 40 km out from the coast.
Development of coastal waters must aim to compromise between man\'s
requirements (in terms of food, leisure, etc.) and safeguarding aquatic
ecosystems. There is no contradiction between these two objectives, even
from the point of view of strict human utilitarianism; this goal can
also be attained by conservation of ecosystems (since reserves or
wildlife parks constitute developments) as well as by modifications. It
has been said that it has now become essential to save the whales and
the elephants \... not for the whales and elephants themselves, but in
order that we develop the qualities that will save them and which will
save ourselves (Panneau, 1990). [[This compromise between strict human
utilisation and conservation of natural ecosystems can also be shown by
sustainable development]{.underline}]{.mark}\*, [which consists of
management and development that are limited with respect to nature but
are permanently renewable]{.underline}, as advocated by the Rio
Conference in 1992.

#### Sustainable development is still resource exploitation -- it just manages it so that long-term exploitation is possible

[[The word \"development]{.underline}]{.mark},\" in its international
setting too readily associated with \"economic development,\"
[[refers]{.mark} here [to]{.mark} the use or [exploitation of a natural
resource]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The word
\"[sustainable]{.mark}]{.underline},\" which conveys the idea of holding
up or support, in this context [[means]{.mark} [development]{.mark} that
is conservative, and [is conducive to continued viability of a
resource.]{.mark}]{.underline} The term \"[[sustainable
development]{.underline}]{.mark}\" which appeared in the World
Conservation Strategy published in 1980 by the International Union for
the Conservation of Nature and was adopted by the World Commission on
Environment and Development, [is used to describe management (i.e.
regulation of use and exploitation, and conservation) of a given
resource in such a manner that the benefits of the resource are
optimized]{.underline}, that is, made available on an equitable basis to
the largest number over the longest term. [It [requires]{.mark} the
[sparing]{.mark} and economical [use of non-renewable resources, and
maintenance]{.mark} of the productivity of renewable
resources]{.underline}, as well as avoidance of or compensation for,
irreversible effects caused to the resource through use or exploitation
that does not meet these standards. [Such equitable allocation of
benefits from a resource necessarily implies regulation of access to the
resource, whether that resource is a stock of fish, a deposit of
minerals, or the air or water]{.underline}; and whether the resource is
fixed, or mobile and fluctuating across national boundaries, or beyond
national jurisdiction in areas sometimes referred to as \"global
commons.\" The Report of the World Commission declares that \...
physical sustainability cannot be secured unless development policies
pay attention to such considerations as changes in access to resources
and in the distribution of costs and benefits. Even the narrow notion or
physical sustainability implies a concern for social equity between
generations, a concern that must logically be extended to equity within
each generation. (emphasis added)1 Thus, according to the Report,
\"sustainable development\" requires, inter alia, (1) \"that \[the\]
poor get their fair share of the resources required to sustain
\[economic\] growth\"; and (2) \"that those who are more affluent adopt
lifestyles within the planet\'s ecological means\.... Painful choices
have to be made\....\" The Report is right to conclude, therefore, that
\"sustainable development\" implies nothing less than the \"progressive
transformation of economy and society\"; and to emphasize that \"in the
final analysis, sustainable development must rest on political will.\"2

#### Sustainable development still requires growth -- conservation doesn't exclude it

**Clancy, 98 -** Indiana University School of Law (Erin, "The Tragedy of
the Global Commons", Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies: Vol. 5:
Iss. 2, Article 12. Available at:
http://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/ijgls/vol5/iss2/12)

Sustainable development is equally fixated with the utilization of
resources and distribution of economic gains. [[Inherent in the term
\"development\" is the concept of growth]{.mark}. This growth is fueled
by the consumption of natural resources]{.underline}. [The term
\"sustainable\" pertains to the distribution of that growth.\"
Ultimately, [sustainable development seeks to promote economic growth so
that current needs can be sated, without jeopardizing the needs of
future generations]{.mark}]{.underline}.34 Arguably, [[conservation is
an integral part]{.mark} of this]{.underline} theory. Clearly, [future
generations cannot prosper if there are no resources to
exploit]{.underline}. The goal then becomes to accurately assess the
highest level of exploitation of resources possible while maintaining a
large enough resource base for future support. This calculation is what
is known scientifically as \"maximum sustainable yield.\"\"

**Sustainable development means resource exploitation without depleting
natural capital stock**

**Pearce et al, 90 -** Professor of Economics at University College
London (David, [Sustainable Development: Economics and the Environment
in the Third World]{.underline}, p. 1)

In this chapter [[we suggest a simple definition of sustainable
development]{.mark}, and elaborate a set of minimum conditions for
development to be sustainable, [the conditions being]{.mark} based on
the requirement that [the natural capital stock should not decrease over
time]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Natural capital stock]{.underline},]{.mark}
in this context, [[is]{.mark} the stock of [all environmental and
natural resource assets]{.mark}, from oil]{.underline} in the ground to
the quality of soil and groundwater, [from the stock of fish in the
oceans to the capacity of the globe to recycle and absorb
carbon]{.underline}. We keep the definition of natural capital stock
deliberately vague in order to capture the more general picture, and in
the belief that a more detailed investigation will not raise insuperable
problems. The meaning of a constant natural capital stock is more
problematic, however, and we therefore devote a little time to
alternative meanings.

#### Development implies management for sustainable use

**Barnabe, 97** -- professor of marine ecology at the University of
Montpellier (Gilbert, [Ecology and Management of Coastal Waters: The
Aquatic Environment]{.underline}, p. 167-168)

It is thus necessary to change strategy, which is what we propose in the
following chapters. Our proposals are based on the work on developing
the rearing of sea bream and sea bass in our laboratory (Barnabe and
Rene, 1972, 1973; Barnabe, 1974, 1976, 1990a), fisheries studies
(Barnabe, 1973. 1976), eco-ethological studies offish in the littoral
zone (Barnabe and Chauvet, 1992; Chauvet et a!., 1991), and also on the
coordination of studies examining aquaculture and aquatic resources
(Barnabe, 1990c, 1991). In order to expose what is happening elsewhere
in the area of exploitation of aquatic resources, [we have chosen the
term \"[development]{.mark}\", as it also [implies]{.mark}
\"[management]{.mark}\" [and]{.mark} comes under the perspective of
\"[sustainable development]{.mark}\" as it has been called since the Rio
Conference]{.underline} in 1992.

### Development\-\--New\-\--2AC

#### Development means new activity

Sigrid Eskeland **Schütz**, 20**18** -- University of Bergen, Norway
"Marine Spatial Planning -- Prospects for the Arctic" Arctic Review of
Law and Politics, v. 9,
https://arcticreview.no/index.php/arctic/article/view/899/2322 //DH

Treaties of particular interest from a European perspective are those
constituting the European Union and any (minimum) requirements on
national MSP-regulation deriving from these. The EU has a strong marine
policy, and regulatory framework in which marine spatial planning now
plays a part. In section 4, I discuss the EU approach to marine planning
and the vital question of whether EU regulations, through the Union's
relationship to Denmark/Greenland and Norway, apply to the European
Marine Arctic. In section 5, [I outline the status of marine planning in
the Arctic,]{.underline} limited to the European/Asian side of the globe
and the Arctic communities in Greenland, Russia and Norway.

Finally, in section 6, I will look at the prospects of using marine
spatial planning as a management strategy for the Arctic. The Arctic is
at the meeting point of common law and civil law systems, drawing a line
between the US and Canada, on the one hand, and the other Arctic states
on the other, with different sub-categories of civil law systems at play
as well. Thus, it is difficult to envisage any kind of potential
political consensus on cooperation on marine spatial planning or
transboundary spatial planning in the Arctic, and how such instruments,
or treaties, could play out in the different legal cultures.

2\. The concept of MSP -- in comparison to land use (terrestrial)
planning

It has been claimed that marine spatial planning is not radically
different from terrestrial spatial planning or land use planning,12 also
named the land-based cousin of marine spatial planning.13 This leads us
to an interesting question: How does marine spatial planning differ from
land use planning? In terms of appearance, a municipal land use plan in
Norway looks similar to a marine plan in the Netherlands, with different
geographical zones marked and hatched on a map, reflecting different
qualities of or uses of the areas.

The purpose of, or reasoning behind, planning has similarities both on
land and at sea. It can be argued that, as an overall objective, the
sustainable [development of land and marine areas should take place in
an economic, social and environmental context]{.underline}, in line with
the principles set out by the World Commission on Environment and
Development.14 Although [the term 'development' suggests new
activity]{.underline}, in the same way as UNESCO's talk of "spatial and
temporal distribution of human activities", it should be noted that
protection or non-use of areas can be just as important.

### Development\-\--Living Standards\-\--2AC

#### Development means to improve the living standards of the population in a region

Alberta, Canada "Arctic Canada and Zambia: A Comparison of Development
Processes in the Fourth and Third Worlds", ARCTIC VOL. 42, NO. 3
(SEPTEMBER 1989) P. 208-216 JSTOR

An overview of development is discussed in the first section of this
paper. In the second part[, processes of development are]{.underline}
more specifically [analyzed by describing the agents of development in
the]{.underline} Canadian [Arctic]{.underline} and a Third World region,
Africa. Then, the consequences of one aspect of development, education,
are presented using a regional comparison between the Canadian Arctic
and a specific Third World country, Zambia. DEVELOPMENT

[As a basic definition, development sets out to improve \"living
standards]{.underline} of the mass [of the low-income population
residing in rural areas]{.underline} [and making]{.underline} the
process of [their development self-sustaining]{.underline}\" (Lele,
1975). However, within this statement are components that, when analyzed
further, make a definition of development far from basic. [Development
consists of directed strategies and programs implementing ways and means
to improve living standards, processes that]{.underline}, whether formal
policy or not, [lead to change in a people\'s societal and economic
structures,]{.underline} and theories that seek to explain and/or
predict why and how strategies and processes affect any given target
population. These three components are briefly discussed before a more
in-depth analysis of processes of development is presented.

#### Arctic development is human development, not resource extraction

Victoria **Hermann**, 20**15** - Gates Scholar and PhD student at the
Scott Polar Research Institute at the University of Cambridge "ARCTIC
MELT TURNING RESOURCE EXTRACTION INTO HUMAN DEVELOPMENT" April,

https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Arctic_Melt_2015_report.pdf

[Development in the Arctic has traditionally focused on economic outputs
and natural resource extraction]{.underline} and production. Policy and
business discussions on how to develop the circumpolar north regularly
measure current and future success on gross regional production,
petroleum field performance, reserves in metric tons, and the price of a
barrel of oil. Climate change has served to exacerbate the focus of
development on the economies of resources. Melting sea ice provides the
potential for easier access to extract and ship natural resources to
international markets and southern centers of consumption. [But
development is more than resource production and economic output -- it
is about people too.]{.underline} Historically, development has been
defined as the structural and long-term transformations of both
economies and societies, and the actions taken to make those changes.8
After World War II and the need to invest in the reconstruction of
Europe, development was transformed into a primarily economic endeavor.
As Europe recovered and colonies gained independence, Western powers
looked to transpose economic development to areas of Africa, Latin
America, Eastern Europe, and Asia.

Over the past five decades, the ideas behind development policy and
financing have moved beyond the singular dimension of economic growth.
The Millennium Development Goals, set in September 2000 by the United
Nations, hold testament to that transformation. They include public
health, equality, education, environmental sustainability, and extreme
poverty and hunger in their targets for world development.9 Through
initiatives like the Millennium Development Goals, [the
U]{.underline}nited [N]{.underline}ations, along with a number of other
local and international actors, have [reformulated the narrow focus of
development based on economic growth and strong markets towards a new
definition based on the wellbeing of communities]{.underline} and the
individuals that form them.

Human development is defined as being "about people, about expanding
their choices to lead lives they value. Economic growth, increased
international trade and investment, technological advance -- all are
very important. But they are means, not ends. Whether they contribute to
human development in the 21st Century will depend on whether they expand
people's choices, whether they help create an environment for people to
develop their full potential and lead productive, creative lives."10

In spite of this global paradigm shift from economic to human
development, conversations and policy proposals concerning the North
today still revolve around growth, profits, and the production of
natural resources. And yet, volatile global commodity prices and
maturing oil fields compel Alaska to think beyond oil revenue to ensure
human development for its residents. [Climate change]{.underline} also
[necessitates a shift to a human-centric definition of development as it
begins to affect health, education, safety, decent employment, and
cultural traditions]{.underline}.

Now more than ever before, [Alaska's development policy must transcend
resource extraction and economic growth to prioritize the wellbeing of
people and communities.]{.underline} The United States must harness the
momentum of their upcoming Arctic Council Chairmanship in April to set
an example of how to combine economic growth, human welfare, and
community resiliency through local infrastructure investments for
long-term prosperity and happiness of its Arctic residents.

#### Development is more than resource extraction

[Development in the Arctic has traditionally focused on economic outputs
and natural resource extraction]{.underline} and production. Exploration
of natural resources is the second largest sector in the circumpolar
economy as a region, and represents roughly USD-PPP 70 billion and
contributes 31% to Arctic GDP (Glomsrød & Aslaksen, 2009). Hydrocarbon
production alone in the region accounts for nearly USD-PPP 9 billion,
imprinting a strong and enduring narrative of the Arctic as a reservoir
of natural resources for world markets. Economies in Alaska are in many
instances based on large-scale exploitation of non-renewable resources
in support of national policies for industrial development and energy
security (Glomsrød & Aslaksen, 2009).

Accordingly, policy and business discussions on how to invest in the
circumpolar north regularly measure current and future success on gross
regional production, petroleum field performance, reserves in metric
tons, and the price of a barrel of oil. Climate change has served to
exacerbate the focus of development on the economies of resources.
Melting sea ice provides the potential for easier access to extract and
ship natural resources to international markets and southern centers of
consumption.

[But development is more than resource production and economic output --
it is about people]{.underline} too. Historically, [development has been
defined as the structural and long-term transformations of both
economies and societies]{.underline}, and the actions taken to make
those changes (Thomas, 2000). After World War II and the need to invest
in the reconstruction of Europe, development was transformed into a
primarily economic endeavor. As Europe recovered and colonies gained
independence, Western powers looked to transpose economic development to
areas of Africa, Latin America, Eastern Europe, Asia, and the
peripheries of the developed world -- including the Arctic.

Over the past five decades, the ideas behind [development
policy]{.underline} and financing have [moved beyond the singular
dimension of economic growth.]{.underline} The Millennium Development
Goals, set in September 2000 by the United Nations, hold testament to
that transformation. They include public health, equality, education,
environmental sustainability, and extreme poverty and hunger in their
targets for world development (United Nations, 2007). Through
initiatives like the Millennium Development Goals, the United Nations,
along with a number of other local and international actors, have
reformulated the narrow focus of development based on economic growth
and strong markets toward a new definition based on the well-being of
communities and the individuals that form them.

In spite of [a rich scholarship on human development research in the
Arctic]{.underline} as noted below, investment proposals concerning the
North today still largely revolve around growth, profits, and the
production of natural resources from a strong path dependence on
hydrocarbon extraction. And yet, volatile global commodity prices and
maturing oil fields [compel Alaska to think beyond oil revenue to
buttress human capital]{.underline}, based on a strong education
foundation. [Climate change also necessitates a shift to a human-centric
definition of development]{.underline} as it begins to affect health,
education, safety, decent employment, and cultural traditions.

[Promoting green tech]{.underline}nology [and innovation is]{.underline}
another [critical aspect of sustainable development in the
Arctic]{.underline}. Investments in [research and development of
renewable energy sources]{.underline}, such as wind and solar power, can
reduce reliance on fossil fuels and decrease the environmental impact of
economic activities. Advanced navigation and [shipping technologies,
such as icebreaker ships powered by cleaner fuels]{.underline} and
remote sensing systems for real-time environmental monitoring, [can
enhance the safety and efficiency of Arctic operations while minimizing
their ecological footprint]{.underline}. Encouraging public-private
partnerships and international [collaborations can accelerate the
development and deployment of these technologies, fostering sustainable
economic growth in the Arctic]{.underline}.

#### Environmental impact statements are Arctic development

Effective governance is crucial for managing the Arctic's evolving
dynamics. Strengthening existing frameworks like the Arctic Council and
ensuring adherence to international legal standards such as UNCLOS can
help maintain stability and prevent conflicts. Enhancing international
cooperation through joint research initiatives and multilateral
platforms can facilitate knowledge sharing and promote collaborative
solutions to common challenges. [Sustainable development practices,
including rigorous environmental impact assessments]{.underline} and the
adoption of green technologies[, are essential for balancing economic
ambitions with environmental protection]{.underline}.

This paper explores the broad contours of climate resilient industrial
development paths. [It defines development as an increase in local
capacities for production and innovation]{.underline} and argues that
[the overarching goal of development is the generation of sustainable
livelihoods]{.underline}. It suggests that. [to be climate
resilient]{.underline}, industry [policies should]{.underline} have four
key design features: 1) they are pro-active; 2) they promote industrial
diversification; 3) they focus on [mobilizing investment in

#### Transport and logistics infrastructure is essential for Arctic development

The exploration of the Arctic has seen a keen interest from government
bodies, scientific communities, and businesses. Special approaches need
to be taken to the development of the region due to the following
characteristics: extreme climatic conditions; pivotal importance of
developing the territories; low population density, insufficient labor
force; remoteness from major industrial centers, inaccessibility of
regional facilities; high resource intensity, dependence on the supply
of resources from other regions; low sustainability of ecosystems. The
Arctic is the region with the highest undiscovered hydrocarbon potential
in the world. [The development of hydrocarbon deposits in the Arctic
requires]{.underline}, among other aspects, [a sufficient transport and
logistics infrastructure for oil and gas transportation]{.underline}
from the offshore zone to the next point of the supply chain. The
[transport and logistics infrastructure]{.underline} of the shelf zone
and the region as a whole [is one of the key factors for]{.underline}
the economic, social, and environmental efficiency of [shelf field
development]{.underline}. Container shipping along the NSR is supposed
to play a major role in the transportation of oil and gas from the
Arctic offshore zone.

### Development\-\--Broad\-\--2AC/1AR

#### Development means economic, political or social progress -- in the Arctic context, that means boosting quality of life, public services, infrastructure for the people that live there

Few concepts are as contested as '[**development'**.]{.underline} It
[can have economic, political, or social implications, but in most cases
connotes progress or improvement]{.underline}.

And then there is the concept of ['sustainable
development']{.underline}, which has [found substantial currency in the
Arctic region, even consisting of one of the Arctic Council's two
mandates.]{.underline} [It adds an environmental caveat to the concept
of development, contending that progress only happens if there isn't a
permanent environmental cost]{.underline} to it.

Although Arctic governance, policy and social science is overwhelmingly
concerned with development, it can be argued that the art and the
science of it is poorly understood, though not for lack of effort.
[Arctic development is hard: tensions exist between industrial activity
and environmental protection]{.underline}; [and between Western and
Indigenous perceptions of quality of life]{.underline}. [Populations are
sparse and remote, and so difficult to provide public services for.
There is a widespread lack of labour and financial capital, affecting
investment and prosperity. Infrastructure]{.underline} -- roads,
airports, ports, broadband, housing and hospitals - [is expensive, where
it exists at all]{.underline}. [Southern]{.underline} or urban [models
of development don't]{.underline} usually [apply]{.underline}, and even
within the Arctic lessons learned do not always transfer across regions.

#### Development is either altering existing infrastructure or the use of new technology for economic growth.

California, Los Angeles, Arctic Research Professor at the U.S. Coast

The Delphi exercise relied on questionnaires [about]{.underline}
possible **[[Arctic development]{.underline}]{.mark}** outcomes in 2050.

[[defined ]{.mark}***development***]{.underline} by combining ideas in
several sources [to arrive at *[the act of **altering existing
infrastructure**]{.mark} (fixed or mobile) or land, ocean, atmosphere,
and/or electromagnetic spectrum use [for]{.mark}*]{.underline} *the
[[purpose of **economic growth**]{.mark} or]{.underline} to improve
[**quality of life**[; or]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[application of
tech]{.mark}nology [for]{.mark}]{.underline} the [production of **[new
goods and services]{.mark}**]{.underline}* (Arctic Council undated;
Arctic Economic Council undated; Wynne Houck 2022). The research team
used a dictionary definition for *outcome*, namely *something that
follows as a result or consequence* (Merriam Webster undated).

#### Political development means the growth in formalized governance and legal structures

**Exner-Pirot '18** \[Heather and Lassi Heininen; 2018; Professor of
Arctic Politics at University of Lapland, Finland; Senior Fellow and
Director of Energy, Natural Resources and Environment at the

Political

[One bright spot in Arctic development has been political
development]{.underline}. Few places in the world can claim to have
assumed the level of innovation and ingenuity in political development
as the Arctic since the 1970s, [driven]{.underline} largely [by
Indigenous self-determination]{.underline} efforts at the local and
subnational levels; [and by a proliferation at the regional level of
international organizations such as the Arctic Council]{.underline}.
While far from terra nullius before the Cold War period, [the growth in
formalized governance and legal structures in the region is
remarkable]{.underline}.

At the same time political development in the Arctic is far from
complete. There is an ongoing incongruity at the local level between
ambitions for self-government and greater independence, and the tyranny
of finances, whereby the tax base of northern polities is almost always
inadequate to the need for public sector spending. Northern and
Indigenous governments will not soon relinquish their dependence on
resource revenues and/or southern capitals, though there are guidelines,
such as the Circumpolar Inuit Declaration on Sovereignty in the Arctic
and that on Resource Development Principles in Inuit Nunaat (in 2009),
for economic self-sufficiency that redefine (state) sovereignty,
including resource sovereignty.

#### Social development means policies directed at improving quality of life

Arctic Politics at University of Lapland, Finland; Senior Fellow and
Director of Energy, Natural Resources and Environment at the

https://arcticyearbook.com/arctic-yearbook/2018/34-yearbook/2018-arctic-development-in-theory-in-practice/301-introduction-arctic-development-in-theory-and-in-practice\]

Social

[Social elements of development are hard to define]{.underline}. While
much of the world accepts the basic parameters of [the UN Human
Development Index]{.underline} -- life expectancy, education and income
per capita -- it **[is considered inadequate]{.underline}** **[in an
Arctic context]{.underline}**. [Considerable effort has gone to
quantifying Arctic social development, for example via the Arctic Social
Indicators]{.underline} (ASI) and Survey of Living Conditions in the
Arctic (SLiCA). [Fate control and cultural vitality, for example, have a
disproportionate importance in the Indigenous Arctic. And health
encompasses much more than mortality]{.underline}, especially given the
disproportionate burden of mental illness in the region, including
substance abuse, depression, family violence and suicide, a result of
colonialism and marginalization.

[Having influence and control over education, health care, research; and
the rate and nature of resource development; are **essential elements to
the quality of social development** in the Arctic]{.underline}. [So is
meaningful occupation, whether in the form of wage employment,
subsistence activities, school attendance or care giving]{.underline}.
The transition from a traditional to a wage economy, and towards a
globalized society, has disrupted social norms and ties. Arctic
communities are seeking a new equilibrium in their social development,
but there remains little consensus on what that should or will look
like.

#### Economic development is either promoting industries, or regional investment

**Exner-Pirot '18** \[Heather and Lassi Heininen; 2018; Professor of
Arctic Politics at University of Lapland, Finland; Senior Fellow and
Director of Energy, Natural Resources and Environment at the
Macdonald-Laurier Institute in Ottawa, Special Advisor to the Business
Council of Canada, Research Advisor to the Indigenous Resource Network,

Practice,"
https://arcticyearbook.com/arctic-yearbook/2018/34-yearbook/2018-arctic-development-in-theory-in-practice/301-introduction-arctic-development-in-theory-and-in-practice\]

Economic

[Economic development in the Arctic comes]{.underline} primarily [in
two]{.underline} very different [shapes: industrial and
local]{.underline}. Public [discussions about Arctic development mostly
focus on]{.underline} the former: [oil & gas, large scale mineral
development and global shipping.]{.underline} There is a reasonable
amount of academic analyses on these topics, though they are often
written from a commodities or markets-centred perspective, rather than
an Arctic-specific one. Popular approaches to the subject often fall
into a hype trap, assuming that Arctic commodities will be exploited
based on conventional market forces without looking closely at the
larger political, social, technical and environmental context dominated
the aspect of centralization and controlled by states and their
State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), as well as Trans National Corporations
(TNCs). Arctic resource development is highly subject to boom and bust
periods, not only in exploration but in attention. The nuance and
broader perspective provided by scholarly analyses is needed.

[Local regional development in the Arctic remains a puzzle. We do not
have a good handle on strategies to diversify economies, create jobs or
attract investment in the rural Arctic beyond large scale resource
development]{.underline}. This is exacerbated in the Indigenous
territories of the North American and most of the Russian Arctic, where
distances are vast, infrastructure is more limited, and a
market-oriented culture has yet to develop. In the absence of a market
economy, the public sector has flourished, but with the unintended
consequence of making the development of small business a challenge in
the North due to wage inflation, high costs and competition from
government employers. Traditional economies -- hunting, fishing,
gathering and reindeer herding -- remain important but often require
participation in the wage economy to support the purchase of gasoline,
snow machines/mobiles, rifles and other equipment. Tourism is often
pointed to as a solution but is better seen as complementing, rather
than leading, rural Arctic growth.

above, the OCSLA codifies federal control of the OCS, declaring that the
submerged lands seaward of the state's offshore boundaries appertain to
the U.S. federal government. More than simply declaring federal control,
the OCSLA has as its primary purpose "expeditious and orderly
development \[of OCS resources\], subject to environmental safeguards,
in a manner which is consistent with the maintenance of competition and
other national needs\.... "17 To effectuate this purpose, the
[[OCSLA]{.underline}]{.mark} extends application of federal laws to
certain structures and devices located on the OCS;18 provides that the
law of adjacent states will apply to the OCS when it does not conflict
with federal law;19 and, significantly, [[provides a]{.mark}
comprehensive [leasing process for]{.mark}]{.underline} certain
[[OCS]{.mark} mineral [resources]{.mark} and a system for collecting and
distributing royalties from the sale of these federal mineral
resources]{.underline}.20 The OCSLA thus provides comprehensive
regulation of the development of OCS oil and gas resources.

Other activities which courts have deemed \"major federal action\"
include the grant of a license to construct a high voltage line, 34 the
issuance of an interim operating license for a nuclear power plant, 35
and the authorization for the abandonment of a railroad line. 36 Even
when the project is constructed with non-federal funds, federal
government action may rise to the level of a \"major action\" if it
makes possible significant effects on the human environment. 37 In City

government. 39 These steps taken by the FAA made possible increased air

Arctic is bounded by a line at 60 degrees north that crosses the Bering
Sea, as part of its]{.underline} International Code for Ships Operating
in Polar Waters (**[Polar Code]{.underline}**), which includes
requirements for ships operating in the Arctic. [This definition differs
from the one established by the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984,

[[There is no consensus defining geographic boundaries for the Arctic as
a region]{.mark}. Various delineators, such as geophysical, climatic,
environmental, and political, are used depending on the
context]{.underline}.5 The Arctic Circle is a latitudinal circle
directly correlated to the tilt of the Earth's rotation about its axis
that varies slightly over relatively long periods of time, currently
approximately 66 degrees North of the equator. Other geophysical
boundaries often used include river drainages, such as the Yukon river
in Alaska, and maritime boundaries as far South as Hudson Bay. Climatic
definitions can rely on isotherms, or cartographical lines drawn based
on average temperatures, and environmental definitions can study tree
line boundaries. Political definitions draw regional boundaries along
administrative borders, such as Russian districts6, or along contiguous
zones such as along the Aleutian Islands chain.7 See Figure 1 for a
depiction of some cartographical definitions of the Arctic.

[[Most U.S. policy definitions of the "Arctic" jut far south of the
Arctic circle, encompassing the entirety of Alaska
including]{.underline}]{.mark} all [[the Aleutian
Islands]{.underline}]{.mark}.8 The southernmost Aleutian Island, Adak,
at 52°N Latitude, is over 1000 miles from the Arctic circle. At the same
time, U.S. officials regularly mock China's claim to be a "near-Arctic"
state. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Arctic and Global
Resilience said "they \[the Chinese\] aren't remotely near the Arctic."9
The Army Arctic strategy calls the Chinese near-Arctic claim
"questionable."10 The Air Force's Arctic Strategy, in referring to
China's near-Arctic claim, mistakenly points out that China's
"northernmost city, Mohe \[52°58'\], shares roughly the same latitude of
Philadelphia \[39°57'\] and Dublin \[53°21'\]."11 Ironically, the Air
Force document also includes the COBRA DANE radar on Shemya Island as an
Air Force Arctic "equity" despite it being at 52°41', further south than
both Mohe and Dublin. [[The]{.mark} geographical mistake and [arbitrary
definition over what is or is not "Arctic]{.mark}" or "near Arctic" [is

To develop a comprehensive understanding of Arctic security, it is
essential to identify the critical drivers of regional strategic trends.
The warming Arctic climate is the primary catalyst for increased
interest, activity, and transformation within the region. [This article
adopts the most common definition of the Arctic, identifying it as the
area north of the Arctic Circle]{.underline} {66.5 degrees North) [while
acknowledging that other definitions exist based on factors such as
temperature, forest line, permafrost, ice coverage, population, and
political boundaries]{.underline}. Further, each Arctic sub-region has
unique characteristics, including economic activity, population density,
military presence, weather patterns, ice coverage, temperature
fluctuations, ocean currents, and ecosystems. Although this article will
address the Arctic as a single region, it does so with an awareness of
the substantial differences among its sub-regions.

[The **[most common]{.mark}** and basic **[definition]{.mark}** of the
[**Arctic** defines]{.mark} the region as the [land and sea area north

[the sun is]{.mark} generally above]{.underline} the horizon [[for 24
continuous hours at least once per year]{.underline}]{.mark} (at the
summer solstice) and below the horizon for 24 continuous hours at least
once per year (at the winter solstice). The land and sea area within the
Arctic Circle is about 8.14 million square miles,4 which is about 4.1%
(or between 1/24th and 1/25th) of the Earth\'s surface, and more than
twice the land area of the United States, which is about 3.5 million
square miles.

The Arctic Circle definition of the Arctic includes the northernmost
part of Alaska---more than one-quarter of the state\'s land area5---as
well as the Chukchi Sea, which separates that part of Alaska from
Russia, and U.S. territorial and Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) waters
north of Alaska. It does not include the more southerly parts of Alaska
or the Bering Sea, which separates that lower part of the state from
Russia.

area of about 6.01 million square miles, which is about 4.3% of the
Earth\'s ocean area.6 This figure uses boundaries for the Arctic Ocean
that include some waters south of the Arctic Circle.7 Other sources,
using different boundaries for the Arctic Ocean, put the size of the
Arctic Ocean at about 5.4 million square miles.8

In May 2017, the eight Arctic States signed the Agreement on Enhancing
International Arctic Scientific Cooperation during the 10th Arctic
Council Ministerial in Fairbanks, Alaska. This is the third legally
binding agreement negotiated under the auspices of the Arctic Council.
The agreement facilitates access by scientists of the eight Arctic
States to Arctic areas that each State has identified, including entry
and exit of persons, equipment, and materials; access to research
infrastructure and facilities; and access to research areas. The
agreement also calls for the parties to promote education and training
of scientists working on Arctic matters.

Arctic Circle Definition

The most common and basic definition of the Arctic defines the region as
the land and sea area north of the Arctic Circle (a circle of latitude
at about 66° 34′ North).3 For surface locations within this zone, the
sun is generally above the horizon for 24 continuous hours at least once
per year (at the summer solstice) and below the horizon for 24
continuous hours at least once per year (at the winter solstice). The
land and sea area within the Arctic Circle is about 8.14 million square
miles,4 which is about 4.1% (or between 1/24th and 1/25th) of the
Earth's surface, and more than twice the land area of the United States,
which is about 3.5 million square miles.

The Arctic Circle definition of the Arctic includes the northernmost
third or so of Alaska, as well as the Chukchi Sea, which separates that
part of Alaska from Russia, and U.S. territorial and Exclusive Economic
Zone (EEZ) waters north of Alaska. It does not include the lower
two-thirds or so of Alaska or the Bering Sea, which separates that lower
part of the state from Russia.

The Arctic Ocean, which is roughly at the center of the Arctic region,
accounts for much of the region's total area. By one calculation, the
Arctic Ocean has an area of about 6.01 million square miles, which is
about 4.3% of the Earth's ocean area.5 This figure uses boundaries for
the Arctic Ocean that include some waters south of the Arctic Circle.6
Other sources, using different boundaries for the Arctic Ocean, put the
size of the Arctic Ocean at about 5.4 million square miles.7

Definition in Arctic Research and Policy Act (ARPA) of 1984

Section 112 of [the Arctic Research and Policy Act]{.underline} (ARPA)
of 1984 (Title I of P.L. 98-373 of July 31, 1984)8 [defines the Arctic
as]{.underline} follows:

As used in this title, the term "Arctic" means all United States and
foreign [territory north of the Arctic Circle and all United States
territory north and west of the boundary formed by the Porcupine, Yukon,
and Kuskokwim Rivers]{.underline} \[in Alaska\]; [all contiguous seas,
including the Arctic Ocean]{.underline} and the Beaufort, Bering, and
Chukchi Seas; and the Aleutian chain.

[This]{.underline} definition, which is codified at 15 U.S.C. 4111,9
[includes certain parts of Alaska below the Arctic Circle]{.underline},
including the Aleutian Islands and portions of central and western
mainland Alaska, such as the Seward Peninsula and the Yukon Delta.

The U.S. Coast Guard states that "The U.S. Arctic encompasses some 2,521
miles of shoreline, an international strait adjacent to the Russian
Federation, and 647 miles of land border with Canada above the Arctic
Circle. The U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the Arctic contains
approximately 889,000 square miles of ocean."10 Figure 1 shows the
Arctic area of Alaska as defined by ARPA; Figure 2 shows the entire

D. Distinctions and Impact Categories for Terrestrial Areas

[The terrestrial environment can be subdivided into the High Arctic, Low
Arctic, and Subarctic]{.underline}. 331 [These categories capture the
largest difference in the Arctic environment, especially with respect to
climate and vegetation]{.underline}. However, [there is still much
**variation** within each **category**]{.underline}, [especially in the
**Low Arctic** and **Subarctic**]{.underline}. For example, the [geology
of the Arctic varies from shield in much of Canada]{.underline},
Greenland, and Fennoscandia to landscapes dominated by sedimentary
deposits in much of Russia and northern Canada\'s Mackenzie River
Valley. 332 Additionally, Arctic geology varies from the mountain ranges
caused by the folding of sedimentary deposits in the Ural Mountains,
Alaska, the Canadian archipelago, and the Yukon Territory in Canada to
volcanic islands, such as Iceland and the Aleutian Islands. 333
[Features such as **glaciers**, **rivers**, **permafrost**, s**ea ice**,
and **forests** also contain many **local variations**]{.underline}. 334
Landforms include the highly glaciated and ice-dominated regions
characteristic of Greenland and the Canadian archipelago, 335 the Arctic
tundra - which is pervasive in Fennoscandia and western Canada, 336 and
boreal forests, also known as taiga, which dominate at lower latitudes.
337

[Defining the exact lines between the High Arctic, Low Arctic, and
Subarctic can be difficult]{.underline}. The boundary of the Arctic is
not a precise line, and can vary quite significantly depending on what
characteristics are used to define where the Arctic begins. 338
Different countries have different geopolitical conventions as to where
the Arctic boundary lies. For example, in Canada it is popular to use
60oN as the boundary since it correlates across much of the country with
the southern border of Canada\'s territories. 339 However, those
conventions often do not transfer seamlessly from one country to
another. 340 Other examples of criteria used to delineate the bounds of
the Arctic are the Arctic Circle, which lies at 66o32 N, the 10oC July
isotherm (the area north of where the mean \[\*498\] temperature in July
is 10oC), or the treeline. 341 None of these is an entirely useful
delineation across all Arctic countries and, thus, there is no
\"official\" boundary to the Arctic. 342 These difficulties in defining
the Arctic manifest equally in the attempt to differentiate between the
High Arctic, Low Arctic, and Subarctic. [Therefore, there is no **hard
line between** the **groups**,]{.underline} but rather general
characteristics of each with some resulting areas displaying
characteristics typical of more than one category. The climate and
geography of the High Arctic, Low Arctic, and Subarctic are each able to
support different kinds of plant and animal life, 343 and, thus, the
biology of a region can be a good indicator of what geographical
category it is in.

Denmark's Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia. These
eight countries are sometimes called the Arctic Eight. The only area of
the Arctic that doesn't belong to the Arctic Eight is a mostly frozen
area called the central Arctic ocean. So when China announced the Arctic
as one of its "new strategic frontiers", it ruffled some feathers.

## Predictability

### Plain Meaning\-\--2AC

#### Prefer plain meaning.

[Words are to be understood in **their ordinary, everyday

of interpretation]{.underline}.1 [It governs constitutions, statutes,
rules, **and** private instruments. Interpreters should **not** be
required to divine **arcane nuances** or]{.underline} to [discover
**hidden meanings**]{.underline}. Justice Joseph Story's words are as
true today as they were when written in the middle of the 19th century,

### General Terms\-\--2AC

#### General terms like "strengthen" or "protection" should be understood [broadly]{.underline}.

**Scalia '12** \[Antonin Scalia and Bryan Garner; 2012; Justice on the
Supreme Court of the United States; American lawyer, lexicographer, and
teacher; Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts, "General-Terms
Canon," Ch. 9\]

[General terms are to be given their **general meaning**]{.underline}
(generalia verba sunt generaliter intelligenda).

[Without]{.underline} some [**indication** to the contrary, general
words]{.underline} (like all words, general or not) [are to be accorded
their **full and fair scope**. They are not to be **arbitrarily
limited**]{.underline}. This is [the general-terms canon]{.underline},
which [is based on the **reality**]{.underline} that [it is **possible
and useful** to formulate categories]{.underline} (e.g., "dangerous
weapons") [without knowing **all the items that may
fit**]{.underline}---or may later, once invented, come to fit---[within
those categories]{.underline}.

### Intent To Exclude Unnecessary\-\--2NC

#### A definition need not [specify]{.underline} something is excluded to [actually exclude]{.underline} something.

**Scalia '12** \[Antonin Scalia and Bryan Garner; 2012; Justice on the
Supreme Court of the United States; American lawyer, lexicographer, and
teacher; Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts, "General-Terms
Canon," Ch. 10\]

[The expression of one thing **implies** the exclusion of
others]{.underline} (expressio unius est exclusio alterius).

Expressio unius, also known as inclusio unius, is a Latin name for the
communicative device known as negative implication. In English, it is
known as the negative-implication canon. We encounter the device---and
recognize it---frequently in our daily lives. [When a car dealer
promises a **low financing rate** to "purchasers with good credit," it
is **entirely clear** that the rate is ***not* available** to purchasers
with spotty credit]{.underline}.

### Intent to Exclude Necessary\-\--2AC

#### Disagreed with the above.

**Scalia '12** \[Antonin Scalia and Bryan Garner; 2012; Justice on the
Supreme Court of the United States; American lawyer, lexicographer, and
teacher; Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts, "General-Terms
Canon," Ch. 10\]

**[Virtually all]{.underline}** the [**authorities** who discuss the
negative-implication canon emphasize]{.underline} that [it must be
applied with **great caution**]{.underline}, since its application
depends so much on context.1 Indeed, one commentator suggests that it is
not a proper canon at all but merely a description of the result gleaned
from context.2 That goes too far. Context establishes the conditions for
applying the canon, but where those conditions exist, the principle that
specification of the one implies exclusion of the other validly
describes how people express themselves and understand verbal
expression.

The doctrine properly applies only when the unius (or technically, unum,
the thing specified) can reasonably be thought to be an expression of
all that shares in the grant or prohibition involved. Common sense often
suggests when this is or is not so. [The sign outside a restaurant "No
dogs allowed" **cannot** be thought to mean that **no other creatures**
are excluded---as if **pet monkeys**, **potbellied pigs**, and **baby
elephants** might be **quite welcome**]{.underline}. Dogs are
specifically addressed because they are the animals that customers are
most likely to bring in; [**nothing** is implied about **other
animals**]{.underline}. On the other hand, the sign outside a veterinary
clinic saying "Open for treatment of dogs, cats, horses, and all other
farm and domestic animals" does suggest (by its detail) that the circus
lion with a health problem is out of luck. (Notice how ejusdem generis
\[§ 32\] also comes into play with this example.) The more specific the
enumeration, the greater the force of the canon:

### "Include" Does Not Exclude\-\--2AC

#### When a "definition" is based on the word "include," it does not [exclude]{.underline} any aff.

**Scalia '12** \[Antonin Scalia and Bryan Garner; 2012; Justice on the
Supreme Court of the United States; American lawyer, lexicographer, and
teacher; Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts, "Presumption of
Nonexclusive Include," Ch. 15\]

[The verb to **include** introduces **examples**, **not** an exhaustive
list]{.underline}.

[In **normal English usage**, if a group "consists of" or "comprises"
300 lawyers, it contains **precisely** that number. If it "includes" 300
lawyers, there may well be **thousands of other members** from **all
walks of life** as well]{.underline}. That is, [the word include does
**not**]{.underline} ordinarily [introduce an **exhaustive
list**]{.underline}, while comprise---with an exception that we will
discuss shortly---ordinarily does. [That is the rule]{.underline} both
[in **good English usage**]{.underline}1 and in textualist
decision-making.2 Some jurisdictions have even codified a rule about
include.3

### No Redundancy\-\--2NC

#### [Reject]{.underline} interpretations that make words [redundant]{.underline}.

**Scalia '12** \[Antonin Scalia and Bryan Garner; 2012; Justice on the
Supreme Court of the United States; American lawyer, lexicographer, and
teacher; Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts, "Surplusage
Canon," Ch. 26\]

[If **possible**, **every word**]{.underline} and every provision [is to
be **given effect**]{.underline} (verba cum effectu sunt accipienda1).
[**None** should be ignored. None should **needlessly** be given an
interpretation that causes it to **duplicate** another provision or to
have **no consequence**]{.underline}.

"These [words cannot be **meaningless**, else they would **not have been
used**]{.underline}."

> United States v. Butler,
>
> 297 U.S. 1, 65 (1936) (per Roberts, J.).

The surplusage canon holds that it is no more the court's function to
revise by subtraction than by addition. [A provision that
seems]{.underline} to the court **[unjust or unfortunate]{.underline}**
(creating the so-called casus male inclusus) [must]{.underline}
nonetheless [be given effect]{.underline}. As Chief Justice John
Marshall explained: "It would be dangerous in the extreme, to infer from
extrinsic circumstances, that a case for which the words of an
instrument expressly provide, shall be exempted from its operation."2 Or
in the words of Thomas M. Cooley: "\[T\]he courts must . . . [**lean**
in favor of a construction which will render **every word operative**,
rather than one which may make some **idle and
nugatory**]{.underline}."3 [This is true not just of legal texts but of
**all sensible writing**]{.underline}: "Whenever a reading arbitrarily
ignores linguistic components or inadequately accounts for them, the
reading may be presumed improbable."4
