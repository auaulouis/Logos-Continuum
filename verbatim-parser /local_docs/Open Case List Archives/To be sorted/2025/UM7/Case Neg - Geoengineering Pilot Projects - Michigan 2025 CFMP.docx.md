[The rollercoaster ride of President Donald Trump's second
administration has caused numerous **ruptures in world
order**]{.underline}. The president's 'America First' agenda has
dominated global headlines with dramas including 'Liberation Day'
tariffs; the unprecedent rupture in relations with Canada and with
European allies; and by the president's attempts to insert himself as a
peacemaker first between Russia and Ukraine and now in a more ambiguous
way between Israel and Iran.

Yet [it is in the US retreat from collective efforts to alleviate
international problems where really profound changes to the
international order can be seen.]{.underline}

The latest US withdrawal from the Paris Climate Change treaty was to be
expected, given President Trump had already done so in his first
presidency. But his second presidency has brought many other new
manifestations of this US global retreat, including the closing of USAID
and the withdrawal from the World Health Organization (WHO).

Equally serious was Trump's signature of an executive order,
'Withdrawing the United States from and Ending Funding to Certain United
Nations Organizations and Reviewing United States Support to All
International Organizations'. The order -- barely recalled now since it
was announced a week before Vice President JD Vance's controversial
February speech in Munich -- withdrew US support from or participation
in several UN agencies and initiatives for their apparent criticism of
Israel.

Other major global initiatives where the US plays a leading role,
including NATO, the World Bank and IMF, have been undermined by some of
President Trump's foreign policies. There is no sense yet that the US is
seeking to withdraw from any of them. But were this to change, the
notion of a US global retreat would heighten.

It is doubtful that President Trump uses the term 'global governance' --
or even knows the term. [But the historic importance of the US when it
comes to underpinning collective responses to global problems cannot be
underestimated. America led the building of the post-1945 world order
and sustained it, overseeing its expansion following the collapse of the
USSR in 1991, which left the US as undisputed global
hegemon.]{.underline}

The ending of one international order does not necessarily beget the
sudden arrival of another.

The US retreat from global governance has already been substantial,
creating space for a remaking of that order. Given this fact, plus the
fraying of nerves among so many US allies and partners though Trump's
tariff policy, the question has to be asked: why aren't Washington's
rivals making more of this moment?

It seems that the ending of one international order does not necessarily
beget the sudden arrival of another in its wake. The vacuums created by
the US's sudden retreat from multilateralism and global governance will
not be automatically filled by others.

Filling the vacuums left by the US

[This is clearly **China's moment** to win big]{.underline}. Indeed, its
ministry of foreign affairs issues a steady stream of propaganda videos
portraying the US as a self-interested, bullying, and unreliable
superpower whose tariffs policy is undermining the free trading system.

[Chinese President Xi Jinping sought direct gains for China at the US's
expense during his tour of three Southeast Asian countries in April --
all hit by US tariffs]{.underline}. And Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi
noted at this year's Munich Security Conference (just a day after
Vance's speech), that China is committed to both the UN system and its
role as a stabilizing international force.

Yet there is no expectation that China would replace the US as the
guarantor of global governance. President Xi has a three-part foreign
policy concept that expresses China's aspiration in this regard.

[China seems to prefer banking the gains it makes as the US alienates
global audiences and institutions]{.underline}.

But so far, its Global Civilization Initiative (GCI), Global Security
Initiative (GSI), and Global Development Initiative (GDI) -- each of
which could herald a more explicit role for China as a global goods
provider -- are not yet matched by commensurate action (Though Xi's
initiatives are still new: the GSI was only launched in 2022).

[Rather than seeking quick and dramatic wins, China seems to prefer
banking the gains it makes as the US alienates global audiences and
institutions, while responding to those destabilizing actions directed
against it, notably in the trade war]{.underline}.

\[AY\]

There are several concerns for the governance of both research and
deployment of geoengineering measures. This moves beyond the first
initial stage of deciding whether to geoengineer and directly addresses
the implementation of geoengineering solutions. [The Arctic is home to
numerous indigenous and local communities. If geoengineering is
undertaken, these communities are at a higher risk (Chuffart et al.
2023) of being **disproportionately affected** by negative side effects.
Including Indigenous communities in the decision-making processes in the
**scientific research phase**]{.underline} (Buck 2018), [already
**before the deployment** of established technologies, thus appears
vital]{.underline}. In that regard, it has been argued that
[participation in decision-making, for example, through communities
providing input to models, may enhance the local communities\'
acceptance of possible geoengineering measures but also contribute to
scientific research on geoengineering itself]{.underline} (Mettiäinen et
al. 2022). This is especially relevant, as the literature currently
reveals a lack of inclusion of Indigenous and local knowledge. Based on
arguments in the literature (Chuffart et al. 2023), future governance
approaches should therefore already address the people dimension in the
testing stages.

[The notion of **consent** plays a dominant role in the people
dimension]{.underline} (Chuffart et al. 2023; Dalby 2015; Parthasarathy
et al. 2012). [Respecting, protecting and fulfilling Indigenous Rights,
such as the right to **f**]{.underline}ree **[p]{.underline}**rior and
**[i]{.underline}**nformed **[c]{.underline}**onsent, [and the provision
of adequate information to base the consent upon, is essential (Chuffart
et al. 2023). Lack of consultation with local communities and indigenous
peoples can **jeopardize the initiation and testing of geoengineering
solutions** (Cooper 2023). This is especially relevant as geoengineering
may further enhance power asymmetries between Indigenous Peoples and the
state, with a **risk for Indigenous self-determination**]{.underline}.
This risk is enhanced in cases where states do not have sufficient
measures in place to ensure free, prior and informed consent (Chuffart
et al. 2023). [Respecting and protecting human and Indigenous rights
before geoengineering solutions are deployed is therefore necessary to
avoid perpetuating patterns of colonialism (Cooper 2023). This is
especially important as geoengineering is seen by some as an act of
colonialism in itself, as the geoengineering discourse often uses a
"terra-nullius logic" in finding "remote sparsely populated areas for
conducting outdoor experiments" (Oksanen 2023, 7).]{.underline} Due to
the history of colonization, Indigenous communities in particular cannot
be assumed to trust that decisions made by others will be in their best
interest (Versen et al. 2022). Geoengineering governance therefore needs
to recognize underlying issues related to indigenous rights, such as
questions of sovereignty (Whyte 2012), and reflect these in the
governance process, should testing and deployment become a reality.

**Only [consent]{.underline} can prevent geoengineering from becoming a
colonial activity.**

\[AY\]

So why does geoengineering pose a problem? Turning to the broader
context within international law, [the ability to 'consent' to any
manner of relations or developments in international law is contingent
on the recognition of a 'sovereign space', which is a prerequisite for
the exercise of self- determination]{.underline}. Historically, in the
crafting of sovereignty and statehood, Indigenous peoples were not
granted such recognition. They were marginalized and subject to colonial
rule -- effectively classed as outsiders of the system (Shrinkhal,
2021). This system (and the lack of recognition of the place of
Indigenous peoples) produced an inequitable distribution of social and
economic benefits, which then produced injustice and claims for
injustice that were seldom respected (Fraser, 2013). However, the post-
Cold War Arctic saw a new world take shape. This new world would take
steps to promote greater Indigenous inclusion and recognition within the
region (Fitzmaurice, 2017). [Generally, within the Arctic states,
Indigenous peoples enjoy benefits such as: welfare, insurance,
employment, recognized property rights (although not directly related to
their status as Indigenous peoples) and some cultural protections. Yet
within the context of the 'green transition' that is, the shift away
from reliance on fossil fuels, the legacy of these colonial power
structures is still evident]{.underline}.

Both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)
and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
(ICESCR) have been key in the evolution of Indigenous self-determination
within international law (Art. 1(1)): 'All peoples have the right to
self- determination by virtue of the right that they freely determine
their political status and freely pursue their economic, social, and
cultural development.'

This did raise questions on how to adequately balance priorities.
Moreover, in relation to the covenants, the United Nations Human Rights
Council (UNHRC) has said that states would not be prejudiced by offering
more protections under existing and future legal frameworks where
Indigenous peoples were concerned -- offering recognition of their place
(UNHRC, 2014). In this respect, the International Labour Organization
Convention No. 169 (ILO, 1989) has been a key part of this recognition
as it does provide guidance on the definition of Indigenous and tribal
peoples, within Art. 1(1)(b):

Peoples in independent countries who are regarded as indigenous on
account of their descent from population which inhabited the country, or
a geographical region to which the country belongs, at the time of
conquest or colonisation or the establishment of present state
boundaries and who, irrespective of their legal status, retain some or
all of their own social economic, cultural, and political institutions.

With the added issues that have arisen through delayed decarbonization
-- [development of geoengineering as a response represents **another
potential avenue of colonial activity**, so consent is a core part of
the discussion when attempting to reconcile any potential implications.
For the Indigenous peoples in the Arctic, the relationship to the
environment carries cultural significance]{.underline}. The Sámi have
knowledge of snow and ice formations and it is an integral part of their
culture (Riseth et al, 2011), for example in traditional activities such
as reindeer husbandry that have a unique tie to their cultural heritage
and identity. Further, concepts such as common property management, the
relational world view and intergenerational equity all have a
significant place in Indigenous culture (Fitzmaurice, 2017), and Sámi
relationships are defined by these characteristics. The United Nations
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, UNDRIP (UN, 2007)
further adds to the framework for the realization of Indigenous rights
in this context. Nevertheless, the acknowledgement of these
characteristics is a feature in the mandate of the Arctic Council. The
Council sought to reflect these characteristics and honour these
commitments when it was established in the 1996 Ottawa Declaration,
noting its duty to 'Promote cooperation and interaction with the
involvement of the Arctic indigenous communities'.

[It is implicit then within this obligation that adequate consultation
should take place with the Sámi should any development occur on what is
traditionally the territory of Sápmi]{.underline}. Thus, based upon the
existing framework, their cultural links to the environment and their
ancestral land, [they are entitled to being consulted before there is
any preliminary testing]{.underline}.

Geoengineering, justice and consent

The nature of harms caused by climate change is that they are unequally
distributed across the globe, from both a spatial and temporal
perspective. Examining these issues through the lens of justice is still
pertinent to our consideration. Whether it is through SRM or through a
more direct modification of the ice, [before even engaging with
geoengineering, governance will need to adequately address this
inability to effectively meet the requirements of justice]{.underline}.
We can effectively relate this to the preservation of economic and
political self-determination of Indigenous peoples. [The FPIC in this
context could be instrumental in addressing how the costs and benefits
are spread when we manage the shortcomings of
geoengineering]{.underline}.

\[AY\]

The development of marine geoengineering as a result of climate change
needs to be incorporated into global ocean law and governance, not only
to prevent environmental harm in transboundary contexts, but also with
respect to Arctic Indigenous peoples. Current international law already
seems to provide a legal framework for geoengineering from a stricto
sensu state perspective. However, whether there is a legal framework
flexible enough to incorporate and regulate new activities will not
matter if this legal framework is not responsive enough and does not
include some level of environmental or climate justice. Such an approach
requires going beyond state's anxieties of control and involving
Indigenous people(s) and local communities in any legal measures that
try to address climate change -- whether this is climate mitigation or
adaptation -- and its harmful effects, especially (but not only) when
such measures will affect their traditional spaces and
practices.Footnote53

From a human rights perspective, this issue of geoengineering is of
particular interest to the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) which provides
the most comprehensive legal guidance for sea-ice geoengineering and
Arctic Indigenous Peoples. For example, in its Resolution 48/14 in 2021
the HRC requested the Advisory Committee (AC) to conduct a study and to
prepare a report on the 'impact of new technologies for climate
protection on the enjoyment of human rights'. The premise of the report
is that geoengineering is not compatible with human rights. The
precautionary approach and States' human rights obligations entail a
duty not to deploy or develop geoengineering technologies, 'given the
associated high risks and uncertainties for the rights of present and
future generations ... and the availability of proven low-risk
alternatives to prevent climate harm'.Footnote54

By considering New Technologies for Climate Protection (NTCP), the HRC
AC emphasised that decisions and impacts of NTCPs could significantly
impact the ability of marginalised socio-economic groups to exercise and
fulfil their human rights, Footnote55 suggesting that 'Indigenous
Peoples and other frontline communities may be particularly exposed to
the negative impacts of NTCPs'.Footnote56 Since 'Indigenous lands and
territories are particularly exposed and at risk of experimental use',
the report argues for the implementation of UN Declaration on the Rights
of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) standards such as their free, prior and
informed consent 'before adopting and implementing any legislative or
administrative measure that may affect them' (UNDRIP Art. 19). The HRC
report also draws from the ScoPEx project that had been planned without
respecting FPIC requirements as well as the Alaska Native opposition to
the Arctic Ice project.Footnote57 The latter drew on the right of
Indigenous peoples not to have the storage or disposal of hazardous
materials on their lands or territories without their free, prior and
informed consent (UNDRIP Art. 29). The report's approach to the
implementation of human rights standards illustrates why in the context
of geoengineering it is vital to have consultation. Each state has the
obligation to implement appropriate measures, and this includes the
inherent duty to consult with those who may be affected to ensure they
are aware of the risks and can consent (or withhold consent). Otherwise,
the report argues, 'it risks compromising the progress on Indigenous
self-determination and increasing existing divisions on geoengineering
research'.Footnote58

However, the conceptualisation of the development of human rights in
NTCPs in the HRC Report still lacks an oceanic component in relation to
Indigenous peoples. Whereas it is alluded to in the case of the
opposition from Alaska Iñupiaq communities to the Arctic Ice Project,
there is still a paucity of thinking about the ocean spaces in light of
both Indigenous rights and geoengineering. This is critical given that
Indigenous peoples rely on the use of oceans, seabed and their
associated environments to ensure their food, health, economic, and
cultural securities and practices. This relationship with ocean-space
that goes beyond 'usage' and 'possession' as traditionally reflected in
international law, is little developed in UNDRIP. In fact, only Art. 25
textually mentions wet non-land spaces providing 'the right to maintain
and strengthen their distinctive spiritual relationship with their
traditionally owned or otherwise occupied and used \[...\] waters and
coastal seas \[...\]'. Equally, there is no mention of ocean-space in
the 1989 International Labour Convention 169 on Indigenous and Tribal
Peoples Convention (ILO 169), the only legally binding instrument that
applies specifically to Indigenous issues and rights. However, ILO 169
Article 13(2) suggests that Indigenous 'land' in international law is
not limited to terra firma but extends to 'the total environment of the
areas which the peoples concerned occupy or otherwise use'.Footnote59 In
effect, international human rights standards that limit state
sovereignty can also apply to the rights of Indigenous peoples and
especially in relation to the land and resource rights of Indigenous
peoples.Footnote60 Since the use of ocean space and access to marine
living resources remain at the core of continued existence of coastal
Indigenous peoples as culturally distinct peoples,Footnote61 it is worth
considering the implementation of Indigenous rights in the marine
Arctic, not least for recognition of their status as rightsholders in
the region.

Consultation and prior consent underpin state-to-state relations at the
international stage and can be used to limit state
sovereignty.Footnote62 States are bound to provide for effective means
of consultation with Indigenous communities in the development of
projects that may affect Indigenous traditional territories, which
includes either scientific or commercial geoengineering activities.
While at least some Arctic states, for instance, have developed robust
consultations and impact assessment mechanisms to fulfil their
obligation to consult with other states on potential transboundary
impacts. However, the application of the right of Indigenous Peoples to
FPIC still lags behind and is seldom implemented within a domestic
context,Footnote63 let alone in a potentially more complex scenario of
transboundary and transnational issues such sea ice use by Indigenous
communities in multiple Arctic states.

In the Arctic, the introduction of geoengineering policies would
therefore represent yet another complex chapter in state-Indigenous
colonial relationships. Even after the formal UN Decolonization process
took place, through the 1960 UN General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) on
the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries
and Peoples Indigenous Peoples across the world have found themselves
trapped within sovereign states with only limited possibilities for
internal self-determination. As a result of colonial policies, they were
either marginalised or forcefully assimilatedFootnote64 and post-cold
war Arctic governance has seen Indigenous Peoples' rights and claims for
more autonomy gain greater recognition.Footnote65 There is still
significant asymmetry in Arctic governance between States and Indigenous
peoples.Footnote66 While broad generalities are often the characteristic
of colonisers and should be avoided, in many Indigenous cosmologies, the
relationship to the environment carries a legal, cultural and spiritual
significance.Footnote67 Given that traditional activities rely on the
environment and have unique ties to Indigenous cultural heritage and
identity, especially as they relate to traditional use of
nature,Footnote68 this makes Indigenous rights and culture more
vulnerable to environmental degradation.Footnote69

As discussed above, the frozen state of ocean space and their
traditional uses have more than mere cultural significance for Arctic
Indigenous peoples, they are an integral component of life of coastal
communities across the regionFootnote70 and beyond the structural
integrity of sea ice, its lack of interaction with other ecosystems
could lead to dramatic consequences for traditional activities. However,
the urgency of the issue also requires including Indigenous perspective
and rights in ocean governance, ordinarily seen as a space for
international relations between states only. Although marine protection,
the rights-based approach to environmental and marine protection in the
UNDRIP and the ILO 169 is broad enough and might even be sufficient to
apply to traditional use of ocean space, if seen as a space for
protection or common heritage. For instance, the right to Indigenous-led
conservation and environmental protection as well as to the productive
capacity of their lands or territories and resources in UNDRIP Art. 29
should be read in conjunction with general international environmental
law.Footnote71 Environmental obligations could therefore be used as
means to bridge the gap between ocean governance and Indigenous rights
as both the UNDRIP and ILO 169 provide 'specific rules for the
protection, conservation and sustainable use of the environment in the
interest of an identified group of beneficiaries'Footnote72 which need
to be understood as part of the corpus of international environmental
law that informs the application of marine environment protection and
preservation provisions, such as UNCLOS Art. 192.Footnote73

However, questions remain. How can the potential effects of ocean-based
technological climate solutions be regulated in a way that includes
Indigenous rights and Indigenous perspectives within ocean governance
when these solutions would be done in the name of global environmental
protection? New marine activities often have a disruptive potential. For
instance, deep-sea mining, which is already governed by the UNCLOS (Part
XI), has already been flagged by the UN as having the potential to
disrupt Indigenous traditional livelihoods. The development of such
activities under the principle of sustainable development therefore
requires Indigenous peoples to engage in the governance of oceans and
the seabed. However, how does the urgency of dealing with climate change
globally materialise with local climate solutions that deal with
specific traditional sea ice use and the services coastal Indigenous
communities derive from the ice cover? The governance of sea ice through
UNCLOS Art. 234 may not adequately provide a framework to include both
the temporal urgency of climate change and the need for consultation at
local scales.

This therefore prompts the question of how ice and not ice-covered areas
would be regulated with the emergence of a technology that produces ice
to cover marine areas. Ice as a resource to be exploited and whose
production and (re)production through technological means need to be
regulated does not come as a shock or a novelty to the international
legal mind. The exploitation of living and non-living resources has come
to define the law of the sea and negotiations to codify the sea and its
resources have also often offered alternative models to collective
extractive imaginaries.Footnote74 If understanding the production of new
sea ice as a resource-intensive activity could lead to the inclusion of
state obligations regarding consultation and consent with Indigenous
communities, it still relies on legal interpretations of physical
environment-human realities as exploitative. It finds roots in the
translation of nature into the language of international law. In the
context of oil and gas development in the marine Arctic, for example,
scholars such as Johnstone have argued that it needs to be and can be
made compatible with international Indigenous rights standards. For this
work, such enterprises need to implement the right of Indigenous peoples
to self-determination and land rights, including rights to traditionally
used coastal and marine areas.Footnote75

As an exploitable resource, ice loses its identity as a physical space
where humans and non-humans interact and as a biota that supports a rich
diversity of species. It omits the intrinsic nature of sea ice as
sustaining life. Ocean connectivities have always had a social
component. Even in western ontologies, the ocean as space to be
navigated and crossed allowed the development of capitalism.Footnote76
Beyond Western legal realities, thus far, local and Indigenous
perspectives have rarely been included in ocean management. As a result,
the social component of ice is completely ignored. To address our new
climate reality with fairness, Indigenous stewardship and
self-determination over ice-covered ocean-space need to be brought to
the fore of global ocean governance. However, as posited above, the type
of marine geoengineering we cover in this paper will be exploitative in
nature. Even if sea ice cannot be conceived of as a resource, marine
geoengineering as a commercial activity is set to exploit ocean space to
produce ice. Therefore, a slight ontological shift is needed. Because
marine geoengineering is and will be an activity that involves the
transformation of a specific part of nature into a resource, we argue
that it should be treated as other resource extractive activities in
ocean governance.

The protection of the environmental integrity of ecosystems is crucial
for Indigenous peoples' cultural wellbeing and to fulfil their right to
self-determination.Footnote77 Protecting marine spaces also is a matter
of decolonisation. As calls to decolonise ocean governance have been
advanced, law of the sea scholars have posited the need to provide a
counter-narrative to the law of the sea's exclusiveness. Ranganathan
argues that while we need to understand that the law of the sea
consolidated an extractive imaginary of the ocean and global prosperity,
two concepts firmly in the same semantic field as global capitalism, the
making of ocean governance nevertheless 'offers insights into the
contingencies and countercurrents of the decolonization moment ... and
... reveals fluid political geographies, alternative models within
extractivism, and divergent understandings of epistemic community'
.Footnote78 In this respect, the development of another form of
extraction and exploitation activity in the form of sea ice
geoengineering could build up a new ius generative momentum and create
room for more inclusion of Indigenous views on ocean and ice
connectivities.

There are nonetheless obvious ontological limits to this argument as it
would effectively commodify sea ice as a resource and would demonstrate
yet again the inherent nature of international law to enable and
facilitate the circulation of capital. At its core, the Anthropocene's
climate crisis, which spurs a desperate need for deus ex machina
solutions such as geoengineering, has been enabled by the flow of
capital. Currently arguments within international law cannot escape
this. However, as Enyew et al. argue, it might be possible to
counterbalance anthropocentrism in international law by favouring the
implementation of nature-centred visions, Indigenous-driven and
-regulated climate actions as well as by 'prioritizing and reporting the
voices of Indigenous representatives'.Footnote79 In resource governance,
this also means considering local and community-level conceptions of
marine resource management.Footnote80 However, one missing piece of this
legal puzzle remains to be found. How does one link ice geoengineering
and ocean governance with a right-based approach? Derived from both
general international human rights law and from the rights of Indigenous
peoples, norms of international Indigenous rights have already been able
to shape the development of environmental protection on land and
conservation policies at sea.Footnote81 Moreover, Indigenous peoples
have often been a driving force behind the development of environmental
protection.Footnote82

The concept of the "Geoclique" originated from the journalist Eli

the most important international conferences on geoengineering
to-date."282 Although some authors may disagree over who exactly belongs
under the Geoclique umbrella, it has been universally agreed upon that
David Keith was a leading figure and driving force of the Geoclique
agenda.

Keith began researching geoengineering in the early 1990s, but it was
not until the boom-period after 2006 when he became a figurehead to the
whole geoengineering sector. Keith has enjoyed an extremely successful
career both financially and academically and graduated with a PhD from
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1991. Keith was entrenched
in academia, teaching science and public policy at institutions
including the University of Chicago, Harvard University, and Carnegie
Mellon University. In 2009 he founded the company Carbon Engineering
Ltd., which was established as another for-profit geoengineering
company, and in 2019 Carbon Engineering secured \$68 million dollars
"mostly from fossil fuel corporations, including Chevron, BHP, and
Occidental Petroleum."283 Most importantly, Keith was selected to advise
bodies such as the Royal Society and IPCC, the Canadian House of
Commons, the UK House of Commons, and the US House of Representatives on
issues relating to climate change and geoengineering.284 Since 2007,
[Keith has been a leading member of the Fund for Innovative Climate and
Energy Research, financed by Bill Gates, to award millions of dollars to
support potential geoengineering projects. This is not an exhaustive
list of his involvement in the history of geoengineering, but it should
be clear that **[Keith]{.mark} continually [occupied]{.mark} a
[position]{.mark} of [incredible]{.mark} [influenc]{.mark}**[e in
**geoengineering's**]{.mark} modern era, which was made [**possible**
**due**]{.mark} to his **[gender, race, class,]{.mark}
[education]{.mark}, and other privileges.**]{.underline}

[Keith]{.underline} stood as an example of the kind of person who
dominates the makeup of the Geoclique, the [[archetype of the
**white**]{.mark} **[male]{.mark} scientist** who had been the **driving
force** of **geoengineering** throughout its existence.]{.underline} The
other scientist most associated with this group was Ken Caldeira, whose
influence eventually exceeded his past LLNL associates.285 Keith and
Caldeira exemplified the modern generation of geoengineering
representatives, as both men inherited the mantle from [Paul Crutzen and
came to embody the new generation of ecomodern male
geoengineer]{.underline}s. In Keith's 2013 book, The Case for Climate
Engineering, he supplemented his arguments by including personal asides
that described his love for nature.286 Keith, alongside his scientific
or public policy-related arguments, also had to demonstrate his own
character and positive relationship to the environment in order to
legitimize his reputation. This was not an insubstantial part of his
argument; Keith deliberately distanced himself from an older generation
of scientists who sought to dominate nature, and he accomplished this
through a carefully curated gendered presentation while expressing
frustration towards those in power who took nature for granted.287

Like Crutzen, Keith was not a publicly enthusiastic geoengineer, but he
has framed his work according to more feminine principles as a means of
nurturing and protecting future generations.288 [Keith's work and his
[public image]{.mark} appealed to the wider cultural [shift]{.mark} from
industrial masculinity [towards eco-modern
masculinity]{.mark}]{.underline}, as [**callousness** towards nature was
**no** **longer** universally celebrated as a **form of masculine
conquest**]{.underline}. In the modern era, even those trying to
recolour the sky with sulfur and the ocean with iron were expected to
give the appearance of appreciating the natural world. The scientific
aspects of geoengineering were unable to support its growth into the
public sphere, geoengineering needed to be associated with social
consciousness and environmental progressivism, while remaining committed
to a techno-scientific solution.

However, while Keith's gender presentation and framing of geoengineering
in his book represented important evolutions in how geoengineering was
introduced to the public, [Keith]{.underline} [failed to address the
many criticisms that have been made against geoengineering over the
years.289]{.underline} While Keith strategically responded to some
criticism, he also ignored many of the more difficult points of
contention. Keith and the modern Geoclique had already established
foundational geoengineering techniques in the 1990s, in the 2000s and
2010s, they focused on revitalising the field by refining and marketing
long-standing geoengineering projects like SAI, iron fertilization, and
carbon capture technology; they did not create wholly new geoengineering
methods.290 This meant that geoengineering experienced significant
growth with very little substantial improvement to its methodology.

For example, the [most well-publicised challenge to geoengineering in
its modern era was an article published in 2008 titled "20 Reasons Why
Geoengineering May be a Bad Idea",]{.underline} by prolific
environmental scientist Alan Robock (1949-). Robock, although he was
outspoken against geoengineering, still shared many of the
characteristics of the pro-geoengineering scientists. While his critique
displayed a greater level of social awareness than some geoengineering,
like Budyko and Wexler before him, Robock demonstrated how [both sides
of the geoengineering conversation were dominated by white male
scientist]{.underline}s. Although Robock presented a number of valid
attacks against geoengineering, his voice was elevated above other
critics on account of his own scientific pedigree. [Robock raised the
issue of ocean acidification, which was a known consequence of carbon
emissions for many years.2]{.underline}91 Keith briefly addressed ocean
acidification, recognised that SAI would not prevent it from worsening,
but buried that fact by surrounding this admission of inadequacy with
ways he believed SAI might help oceans.292 [Several of Robock's
criticisms pertained to the unknown effects of SAI, including monetary
cost, the effects on clouds, effects on agriculture, and other
unknowable consequences.293 Rather than engaging with this well-known
criticism]{.underline}, [Keith failed to even acknowledge these points
of contention]{.underline}.294 Despite the fact that Keith's book was
published five years after Robock's article, Keith did not manage to
produce a credible defence of geoengineering's undeniable problems.

Therefore, [[Keith's book]{.mark} was **[not a defence]{.mark}**
[along]{.mark} **technical or [scientific]{.mark}**
[**lines**]{.mark}]{.underline}[;]{.mark} the more important
[[mission]{.mark} of Keith and the rest of the Geoclique geoengineering
was to **[garner]{.mark}** greater societal and **institutional
[acceptance]{.mark}** by other means]{.underline}. Critically, the
**[[repackaging]{.underline}]{.mark}** of geoengineering **[[rested
upon]{.mark} a foundation of [eco-modern
masculinity]{.mark}]{.underline}**, distinguishing it from the
industrial masculine machismo of the LLNL era that came before.
[However, eco-modern masculinity [**did not fundamentally
challenge**]{.mark} the **[colonial aspects]{.mark} of
geoengineering**]{.underline}, the **[[whiteness]{.mark} of those
involved]{.underline}**, [[or]{.mark} how geoengineering fundamentally
[**supported** a **status quo built** **upon fossil fuel
capitalism**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Keith's social legitimacy
stemmed from all of the same white and masculine sources as
before.]{.underline} As an aged white man who spent the majority of his
life attached to a series of prestigious institutions where he engaged
in serious scientific research, he had a "look" of someone with
authority on any scientific matter and drew upon the same social and
cultural capital as Crutzen and others.

As part of Keith's goal to establish his progressive
pro-environmentalist credentials, he claimed that most critics of
geoengineering identified "with the right end of the political
spectrum."295 In that same section, he conflated those against
geoengineering with conspiracy theorists who believed world governments
poisoned their citizens with chemicals released by planes.296 [Keith
made this argument despite the fact that **conservative institutions**
such as the **military**, **oil** **industry**, and **venture
capitalists** were **fueling** the development of geoengineering
research]{.underline}.297 In fact, a little later in his book, Keith
attempted a rebuttal against well known leftwing anti-capitalist author
Naomi Klein. [Klein was in all likelihood selected due to her popularity
and the fact that, in reality, the most prominent opponents of
geoengineering were left-wing environmental activists and
schola]{.underline}rs.298 Keith again attempted to out-flank Klein on
the left, and criticised her book for attempting to "weaken the power of
the rich rather than...help the poor."299 Keith defended his position by
stating that leftists attempted to hijack the climate debate as a means
of challenging capitalism; Keith presented himself as someone more
committed to stopping climate change than anti-capitalist
environmentalists, while also promoting a technology that fundamentally
supported capitalism.300

Keith's attempt to equate opposition to geoengineering with reactionary
conspiracism was extremely disingenuous and disguised the fact that
Keith's own work largely supported wealthy conservative elements within
society. [Keith's [strategy]{.mark} [mirrored]{.mark} broader
[trends]{.mark} emerging [within **eco-modern masculinity**]{.mark}, as
other eco-modern men [**appropriated leftist rhetoric** to]{.mark}
**[greenwash]{.mark}** their fundamentally [**conservative agendas** in
**support of traditional industries**]{.mark} and the **modern**
**technology** **sector** also [dominated by]{.mark} faux-progressive
**[rich white men]{.mark}**]{.underline}.301 Not only did Keith continue
to support the conservative institutional agenda, he also actively
discredited genuine left wing environmental figures.

In public, such as during his TedTalks on geoengineering, [Keith
presented himself as someone critical of geoengineering who had
advocated for nothing beyond increased research and
regulation]{.underline}.302 In private, Keith personally profited
immensely from his work in geoengineering and did more than any other
person to transform geoengineering from theoretical research into
material reality. Not only did Keith's own company secure millions of
dollars in funding from the fossil fuel industry, but influence over the
wider field granted him significant social capital as well.303 It would
be impossible to say what Keith genuinely believed, whether his stated
reluctance was legitimate or if he recognised that over-enthusiasm hurt
geoengineering in the past, but his for-profit company went beyond his
public calls for greater research and institutional regulation. His
cautionary public persona did not align with his active pursuit towards
concrete geoengineering advancements

Carbon Engineering, despite having been founded by Keith, was not even
engaged in SRM research, which was the type of geoengineering he most
commonly promoted and something he began researching in 1992.304
Instead, Carbon Engineering was founded as a forprofit company engaged
in CDR. As stated previously, one of CDR's major hurdles was its
cost-inefficiency. As uncovered by Clive Hamiton, Keith began this
company with the help of two primary investors, Bill Gates, the largest
geoengineering investor in the world, and Norman Edwards, a Canadian oil
sands billionaire.305 Despite the fact that Keith criticised the
ultrawealthy polluting class within his book, Keith was still willing to
accept Edwards' funding. Keith was also not unaware of the personal
benefit that would have come from cracking the CDR cost problem,
admitting that if it worked, they would be "printing money."306

There can be [no clearer [example]{.mark} of how the Geoclique laundered
geoengineering than by tracking the [source of]{.mark} their
[funding]{.mark}.]{.underline} **[[Bill Gates was a crucial
financier]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [as were similarly white eco-modern
male billionaires]{.underline}: Richard
**[[Branson]{.underline}]{.mark}** of Virgin, Elon
**[[Musk]{.underline}]{.mark}** of Tesla and SpaceX, and Niklas
**[[Zennstrom]{.underline}]{.mark}** of Skype. While these men [were
vocal [supporters]{.mark} of environmental projects]{.underline}, they
were [equally [**unwilling to challenge systemic** **roots**]{.mark} or
institutions that drove climate change.]{.underline} Gates could have
spent his money on all manner of projects, including proven
environmentally beneficial technology; instead, Gates belittled solar
energy as "cute", and was only interested in novel forms of technology
that promised to erase problems while benefiting those already in
power.307 [Despite Gates' attempts to whitewash his image with
philanthropy, he still embodied many of the same counterproductive
qualities present in eco-modern masculinity,]{.underline} including his
technology fetish directed towards geoengineering. [For [**eco-modern**
**masculinity**]{.mark}, boring, **[reliable]{.mark}, or
socially-oriented [technology]{.mark}** was **[less v]{.mark}aluable**
[than]{.mark} the theoretical innovation that has driven hype-cycles in
the also **[male-dominated technology industry.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

In addition to white tech billionaires, [the Geoclique became bedfellows
with radical conservative climate deniers and the oil
industry.]{.underline} Beyond Edwards' investment in Keith's company,
conservative think-tanks including The Cato Institute, The Hudson
Institute, and The American Enterprise Institute emerged as outspoken
supporters of geoengineering.308 The American Enterprise Institute
published an article in 2013 stating that "the economic benefits of a
successful SRM program would flow from a reduction in climate damages
owing to warming, and a reduction in economic damage caused by
\[greenhouse gas\] controls."309 As think-tanks supported by profits
from the fossil fuel industry, these bodies were created to thwart any
action that could harm their profits, both from the negative effects of
climate change or from governments halting their emissions.

In this system of funding, the [[personal beliefs]{.mark} or morality of
geoengineers like Keith and Caldeira [did not]{.mark}
[matter]{.mark};]{.underline} like the scientists who worked on
Operation Stormfury, geoengineering research served a purpose
independent of individual intention. [Those [most invested in
geoengineering]{.mark} were [nearly universally white, male, rich, and
Western]{.mark}]{.underline}. Billionaires, conservatives, and the oil
industry recognised that climate change represented an [**[existential
threat to their wealth]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} [their **sources** of
**system power**,]{.mark} and therefore **[needed a solution]{.mark}**
that [did not involve]{.mark} sweeping societal
[change]{.mark}.]{.underline} Geoengineering was the technology that
many of them decided was the silver bullet they needed, and they
financed geoengineering's growth because it served their own interests.
The technological aspect of geoengineering was especially appealing to
those already attached to the tech industry, like Gates and Musk, but it
also aligned with masculine ideals more generally.

### K\-\--Foucault\-\--Link

#### SAI and solar geoengineering are forms of [environmental biopolitics]{.underline}, reproducing colonial power structures and extending the apparatus of state control of the human onto the planet as a whole, reducing life to statistics and entrenching Western thought at the cost of marginalized and indigenous voices.

7.2 Power and Democracy The [discussion on the **governance of SAI** is
deeply **intertwined** with **power** **dynamics** that reflect broader
modern socioeconomic structures]{.underline}. SAI [cannot be seen in
isolation from the political and market spheres]{.underline}. Several
criticisms emerged during the interviews, and in literature critical to
SAI, in terms of [how **capitalist practices** are the **root cause** of
the ongoing climate crisis]{.underline}. While the discussion on
capitalism is not the focus of my study, one cannot discuss [**modern
power relations** and **technology** without discussing politics
alongside capitalist practices and vice-versa]{.underline}. At the same
time, other socioeconomic practices and short-term thinking should not
be seen solely as oriented by capitalism. As cited by David Keith, a
good example is the use (and industry) of fossil fuels. Saying that
climate change and environmental degradation are inevitable consequences
of capitalist practices may risk reducing and limit the discussion on
what needs to be done to deal with climate change at different levels.
Such practices need to be unpacked in order to have a better grasp of
what criticisms toward the coming together of 'capitalism' actually
mean. [Power in a broader sense, scrutinizes social, environmental, and
economic relations.]{.underline} To Foucault, [power is a matter of
domination or the overextension of power's reach]{.underline}, and it's
worth noting that it [does not apply strictly to de facto politics, but
to **all aspects of** **life** (]{.underline}Cisney and Morar 2015). For
[power to be legitimized]{.underline} there must be [certain actors that
produce its own rules and]{.underline} [truths]{.underline}. Power
"cannot be exercised unless a certain 'economy' of discourses in which
'truth' functions, on the basis of, and thanks to, that power"
(Foucault, 1975a/1995; Cisney, Morar 2015: 2-4). [Currently, the
structures for these relations influence and perpetuate ethical
compromises and systemic inequities.]{.underline} For Kevin Anderson,
inequality and massive concentration of power are the principal drivers
of inaction. He argues how not only politicians, [but several
stakeholders in society share the responsibility for continued failure
to address climate change]{.underline}, as he explains it is "[the
wealthy few,"]{.underline} including top and senior academics,
[journalists, **policymakers**, and entrepreneurs]{.underline} who have
enough power to change the course of action but deliberately "choose not
to do something different." To him, stories about technological
development for the future are used to "avoid the difficult challenges
which are more equity-based, and we have to add that."

The [**role of industries** in modern society and how they are
economically and socially oriented plays a **distinguished role in the
SAI discourse**]{.underline}, [oscillating between innovation and
exploitation]{.underline}. Although researchers of SAI argue about the
physical -- and increasingly social -- [interplay of SAI with the planet
and people, the capitalist hegemony and its power in framing perceptions
is still often ignored.]{.underline} Jason W. Moore critiques this
process in our interview, [arguing how the focus on domination and
**alienation from capitalism** undermines humanity's potential to
engage]{.underline} [cooperatively with the]{.underline} planet. The
idea of humans and other [species as "ecosystem engineers]{.underline}"
[emphasizes the transformative potential of cooperative, conscious
labor]{.underline}. However, the prevailing focus on [domination and
alienation]{.underline}, as argued by Moore, is [also seen in
geoengineering and undermines this potential (]{.underline}see also
Commoner (1972) for a similar discussion). The [governance]{.underline}
of **[SAI]{.underline}** also [raises previously **demonstrated
questions** about **knowledge production** and its underlying
assumptions]{.underline}. The Harvard Solar Geoengineering Research
Program's [inclusion of diverse perspectives is a step
forward]{.underline}, but it [remains **insufficient** to **address**
the marginalization and **exclusion of** **knowledge**]{.underline},
reflection of the [**hegemony of western-scientific thought** as the
only valid way to produce knowledg]{.underline}e (cf. Akena, 2012; Held,
2023). In a scenario in which [SAI is presupposed as a planetary-scale
technology]{.underline}, there is [a **risk** that people are **not
able** to **bring their knowledges** to the debate, thus limiting
democratic participation and freedom]{.underline}. As Kevin Anderson
argues, "My high point is freedom \[...\] you shouldn't be forcing
things on other people, [so freedom from and freedom to
debat]{.underline}e. **[There is no debate that should never be fully
solved]{.underline}**." [Without a seriously comprehensive and inclusive
participation in SAI discussions,]{.underline} with people from all over
the world, [we risk undermining democratic systems by **leaving the
decision to "ruling elites**" who "**manufacture consent**"]{.underline}
(cf. Gare, 2017: 145). David Keith also recognizes there are limitations
to the possibility of a democratic participation in SAI saying "That\'s
one of the evil inequalities of the world. But of course, that\'s not
special for geoengineering." To Keith, "[concentration of power is the
central bad thing]{.underline}." In the context of capitalist dominance,
[there are **clear risks** in having a **centralized authority** in
managing a planetary-scale technology.]{.underline} Effective
[governance requires distributed, balanced power structures]{.underline}
to ensure accountability and equity in every sphere of society[. At the
same time, the **scale proposed for SAI** **requires** **robust
frameworks** to manage its environmental, social, and ethical
dimensions]{.underline}, but [existing governance **mechanisms remain
insufficient**]{.underline}. The [global north's dominance in scientific
and technological governance exacerbates this imbalance,
r]{.underline}aising **[concerns about neocolonialism]{.underline}** and
the **[sidelining of Indigenous knowledge systems]{.underline}** (as was
discussed in chapters 5.5 and 6.3). Control therefore is a crucial theme
for SAI discussions. [**Foucault's** notion of **power as fluid and
relational** provides a lens to examine how stakeholders exert influence
across these domains]{.underline}. **[Control in SAI]{.underline}**
debates manifests not only in the tangible aspect of
**[controlling]{.underline}** the planet's temperature but in various
other domains: [control of the environment, control of temporalities,
and regulation of SAI research and deployment. As]{.underline} reliance
on [technocratic governance grows,]{.underline} the [concept of
**accountability** becomes more **ambiguous**.]{.underline} The
delegation of planetary-scale interventions to institutions --
governmental or corporate -- risks [marginalizing public engagement and
supervision.]{.underline} Moreover, Stacy van DeVeer poses a rhetorical
question regarding societal trust, essential in democratic participation
and governance of SAI: "[Who would society trust to alter what's in the
atmosphere?]{.underline}": My concerns revolve around the fact that it
[seems to be much more likely to be run by, **decided o**n, managed **by
a small subset** of the global or international community]{.underline}.
And it\'s **[a big experiment]{.underline}**. So in that sense,
[**wealthier, higher-tech societies** will be **experimenting** not just
on the atmosphere, but on **people around the world**]{.underline}. And
they won\'t be able to consent.43 [This issue becomes more pressing when
considering **marginalized communities**, whose **voices are often
downplayed** and even **excluded** from decision-making
processes]{.underline}. This argument is fundamental to understanding
how the modern political and geopolitical systems may not be ready to
support or govern SAI through a democratic and just basis in terms of
trust, as van DeVeer explains. While David Keith describes SAI as
cost-efficient, and possibly safe, Kevin Anderson brings the point of
how "it's not only about technology, it's about how the public sees the
technology," thus describing another aspect that needs to be taken into
consideration. A similar argument is given by Ryan Carolan with his idea
of fragmentation versus reconciliation. It may be difficult to envision
under current conditions a shift as expressed by Alf Hornborg: In the
normal course of events, I don\'t see how democratically governed
countries will ever get their populations to vote for politicians who
are going to reduce their consumption levels so drastically.44 However,
for Jason W. Moore who explicitly presents himself against solar
geoengineering, it is not democracy as such which is the problem but
rather the opposite: People think of solutions as technical \[...\] what
we need is more democracy to solve these problems and 'oh, by the way,
[it's no mystery what we need to do: we need to decarbonize' that's not
hard to do. I mean, given the political imbalance of forces in the world
today, it is very hard to do, but technologically in the abstract, it's
not difficult given democratic control over these processes.45 For
Moore, it is rather the lack of democracy that is the
problem.]{.underline}

7.3 Biopower and Apparatuses The [governance of life, both human and
non-human, is central to understanding the ethical and political
implications of SAI and other geoengineering alternatives.]{.underline}
Foucault's concepts of **[biopower and apparatus]{.underline}**
(dispositif) provide a [distinct tool to **analyze
governance**]{.underline}. Biopower refers to the techniques and
mechanisms that regulate life, governing populations through
surveillance, control, and normalization (Foucault 1978/2008: 241). This
[form of power shifts the sovereign power's right "to take life or let
live"]{.underline} with the **[imperative "to make live and to let
die"]{.underline}** -- a shift that [fundamentally restructures
political governance in the 18th century.]{.underline} Apparatus, as
explained in Chapter 2.1.2, constitutes the networks of institutions,
discourses, and technologies through which biopower operates. Together,
these concepts allow for sc[rutiny of how life is currently governed and
allow a more nuanced understanding of how geoengineering governance
intersects with power, life, and technology.]{.underline} These
[dimensions]{.underline} [shape how sociotechnical systems]{.underline}
-- such as **[solar geoengineering]{.underline}** -- are envisioned,
implemented, and contested. [In the **context of SAI**, the
**technology** itself functions as an **apparatus**, **reinforcing
infrastructures**, **experiments**, **policies**, and **narratives**
that **seek to regulate planetary systems.**]{.underline} If traditional
bi opower targets human health, birth rates, and mortality, [SAI
**expands** this logic to the Earth's climate system, **translating**
**power** into the **control** of **atmospheric** dynamics]{.underline},
**[radiation]{.underline}** balance, and **[stratospheric
composition]{.underline}**. For the discussion on SAI, I [propose the
emergence of **environmental** **biopolitics** --]{.underline} one in
which the [regulation of life extends beyond human populations to the
nonhuman world.]{.underline} Foucault (1975a/1995) argues that [modern
governance is characterized by a transition from
anatomo-politics]{.underline} -- the disciplining of individual bodies
-- to biopolitics, which manages populations as statistical entities.
While [biopolitics coincided with the rise of scientific management,
data-driven governance, and colonial expansion]{.underline}, all of
which sought to optimize life through rationalization, [**SAI**
introduces a **mode of environmental biopower** that seeks to **optimize
the planet's climate** through **scientific and statistical
interventions**]{.underline}. As discussed here, this [raises a series
of difficult questions about who benefits, who is exposed to risks, how
populations are disciplined and governed in the name of climate
management, and how planetary life is to be governed.]{.underline} One
also needs to ask [crucial questions]{.underline} such as: to [what
extent does SAI]{.underline}, as an apparatus, **[serve the interests of
powerful actors]{.underline}** [while presenting itself as a neutral
tool of planetary management]{.underline}? [**Who has the authority** to
regulate planetary systems? And can the climate be governed in such a
way without reinforcing historical inequalities and colonial patterns of
control?]{.underline}

for the [possibility of nuclear war.]{.underline}Footnote87 Preemptive
[security practices of anticipating]{.underline} or imagining [possible
future catastrophes has been closely linked to potential health and
environmental threats]{.underline},Footnote88 and the
[[prospect]{.underline}]{.mark} of developing [[SAI

[Cold War]{.mark} context of attempting to '**[control the

military purposes of mastery and strategic advantage **against potential
threats**]{.underline}.Footnote89 In addition, **[[SAI parallels nuclear
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}** as a technology with [planetary-altering
capabilities]{.underline} that has [already sparked concerns about who
will control and potentially use the technology.]{.underline}Footnote90
A [[key element of **preemptive** **security thinking**]{.mark} and
practice in the nuclear context during the Cold War was [racing to
control]{.mark} and secure the technology]{.underline},Footnote91 [and
**[governance]{.mark}** of nuclear weapons technology is
**[centralised]{.mark}**, hierarchical, and
**[hyper-securitised]{.mark}** [despite]{.mark} the open, cooperative,
and [science-led governance]{.mark} of the technology
[envisioned]{.mark} by its developers]{.underline}.Footnote92
[[SAI]{.mark} governance]{.underline} differs technologically and
historically but could **[encounter [similar]{.mark}

already existing concerns about **domination of SAI** by the **Global

**response**]{.underline} even if that requires contravening a
governance regime and [regardless of the breach of actual scientific
thresholds for such an emergency]{.underline}.Footnote97 According to
Claudia Aradau and Rens van Munster, [preemptive security
practices]{.underline} 'aim to [[**act on threats**]{.mark} that are
unknown and recognized to be to be **[unknowable]{.mark}**]{.underline},
yet **[[deemed potentially catastrophic]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[**[requiring]{.mark}** security **[intervention]{.mark}** at the
**[earliest]{.mark}** **possible**
[stage']{.mark}]{.underline}.Footnote98 In [securitisation
theory]{.underline}, a [distinction is usually made between threat and
risk, [where **threats**]{.mark} are '[**existential**,
**imminent**,]{.mark} and clearly]{.underline}
**[[identifiable']{.underline}]{.mark}**,Footnote99 [which
**[justify]{.mark}** or legitimate **[exceptional
practices]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [**[climate]{.mark}** has had an
uneven career as a [**securitised referent** **object**]{.mark} because
of the challenges associated with understanding it as immediate and
clearly identifiable.]{.underline} However, as the [systemic risks of
climate change proliferate and intensify,]{.underline} the
[**distinction** between risk **and threat in** securitisation theory
blur]{.underline}. As William Clapton writes:

In a period of change, [contingency, and widespread
**[anxiety]{.mark}**]{.underline} produced by the collapse of control
over debounded risks and the [subsequent emphasis on their
**[catastrophic potential]{.mark},**]{.underline} [exceptional
[behaviours]{.mark} on the part of states and other actors [can be
**justified**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Gone is the emergency produced by a
clearly identifiable, existential, and imminent threat, replaced instead
by an urgency generated by collective imaginaries of future catastrophic
possibilities.Footnote100

[Climate change presents us with an uncertain future]{.underline}.
[[**Preemptive** security **framings**]{.underline}]{.mark} and
[[practices]{.mark} of [**risk** calculation]{.mark} are **[resistant to
uncertainty]{.mark}** and try to respond to a crisis before it
happens]{.underline}. In preemptive security logics [[disasters]{.mark}
are a **[negative]{.mark} [outcome]{.mark}**]{.underline} of [**[failing
to prevent]{.mark} a [crisis]{.mark}** from passing a particular
threshold.]{.underline}Footnote101 The notion of
[[crisis]{.underline}]{.mark} associated with climate change is
**[[slippery]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which creates [[room to
claim]{.mark} that [if]{.mark} something is [not done]{.mark}, such as
SAI, [disaster will happen]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is an
[intelligible]{.underline} [process to traditional security
actors]{.underline}. As Claudia Aradau and Rens van Munster explain, 'As
an object of knowledge and governance, [[**catastrophes are made**
**knowable**]{.mark} and amenable to action through the deployment of
particular styles of reasoning']{.underline},[Footnote102 meaning that
making sense of something, like climate change, as a crisis or emergency
requires an available response that can be demonstrably directed at the
problem.]{.underline}

In contemporary security logics, accuracy or efficacy of a calculation
or a technology does not solely determine its application.Footnote103
Whether something is intelligible as a response matters. [SAI could
easily fall under this category in a situation where an emergency or
crisis is declared]{.underline} and a sense that '[something must be
done']{.underline} to [respond]{.underline} to a [potential catastrophic
future]{.underline} emerges. Research has found that [public
perceptions]{.underline} of climate change are strongly
[influenced]{.underline} [by]{.underline} [extreme
weather/climate]{.underline} [events]{.underline},Footnote104 and if a
[high-impact climate event]{.underline} like a mass wildfire, damaging
storm system, or flood focuses [public demands for action SAI is
something that can be done]{.underline} (if the technology is
developed), **[even if it does not solve the problem]{.underline}**. In
the context of preemptive security logics, [[decision-makers]{.mark}
face a [trap]{.mark}]{.underline} in which '[we will call to account
those who **confront the incalculability**]{.underline} and say it is
[undecidable in advance]{.underline}; we will say that they failed to
secure us.'Footnote105 [**Security [officials]{.mark}** []{.mark}may be
[**moved to** **act**]{.mark} at a much [lower threshold]{.mark} than we
should be comfortable with when it comes to use of SAI]{.underline}. As
climate change becomes further securitised through the [**[language of
'climate emergency']{.mark}**, the [drive]{.mark} towards **[technofix
solutions]{.mark}** may **[merge]{.mark} with preemptive [security
frameworks]{.mark}** because 'the notion of **[crisis]{.mark}** refers
not just to the actual moment of decision but [includes]{.mark} the
**[broader]{.mark} prior [strategic choices]{.mark}** and actions [that
move]{.mark} or prevent a [situation]{.mark} from moving in the
direction of the decisive moment of victory or
defeat.]{.underline}'Footnote106 An [extreme weather event]{.underline},
for example, may [create a call for action]{.underline} that leads to
[deployment of geoengineering]{.underline} to demonstrate that
policymakers are responsive to the political and security demands of the
public. A scenario like this was recently imagined in Kim Stanley
Robinson's 2021 science-fiction work Ministry for the Future. The book
imagines a [heat wave]{.underline} in India that [kills approximately 20
million people]{.underline} and [spurs]{.underline} India to begin a
unilateral [SAI programme,]{.underline} which is largely successful in
both climatological and political terms.Footnote107 Robinson's book
posits a scenario that [echoes the thinking evinced in much of the
literature and among investors and researchers interested in solar
geoengineering that considers the conditions under which SAI might be
used]{.underline}. Indeed, Chris Sacca, a billionaire [venture
capitalist]{.underline} heavily [invested]{.underline} in solar
geoengineering research,Footnote108 drew on Kim Stanley Robinson's
imagined scenario when he recently stated: 'The odds are 100 percent
that some country pursues sunlight reflection, particularly in the wake
of seeing millions of their citizens die from extreme weather', because
'The world will not stand idly by and leaders will feel compelled to
take action.'Footnote109 A serious climate event in the context of the
broader climate emergency leads a vulnerable state to deploy SAI as a
fast-acting response, which may help spur international cooperation and
an effective, fair governance regime. This is a plausible sequence of
events, but it is not the only plausible scenario, and may not be the
most likely.

[**SAI** is not especially technologically difficult to
implement]{.underline} -- 'Any country that is able to operate airports,
and has access to sulphur (including from coal) could implement SAI,
provided that it can procure planes able to spray aerosol'Footnote110 --
but keeping it up indefinitely would be a logistical, resource intensive
challenge.Footnote111 [More importantly, **[managing the
potential]{.mark}** environmental and political **[risks]{.mark}** of
the technology [in the **absence**]{.mark} **of effective
[international]{.mark}** **[governance]{.mark}** would
**[require]{.mark} strong [military]{.mark} capabilities** to both
[organise]{.mark} and protect the critical **[infrastructure]{.mark}**
needed]{.underline}Footnote112 and [resist political
pressure]{.underline} and [sanctions]{.underline} against unauthorised
use that may or may not cause unacceptable side effects for other actors
or communities. [Large militarily and economically powerful actors are
less likely to be hit with sanctions than smaller powers]{.underline}
and there is currently [no clear sanction regime under the
UNFCC]{.underline} in the case of unilateral use.Footnote113 Given these
considerations, a perhaps more plausible scenario might be one in which
a powerful actor [unilaterally deploys SAI not on their own
behalf]{.underline}, but for ostensibly altruistic purposes, to
[demonstrate responsible leadership]{.underline} in the climate
emergency.Footnote114

By the **[[mid-1960s]{.underline}]{.mark}**, it was [[reasonable]{.mark}
to argue that [war]{.mark} was the primary [focus]{.mark} of
[American]{.mark} [meteorology]{.mark},]{.underline} illustrated no
better by the fact that "in 1965, [**14,[300 meteorologists]{.mark}**
[worked]{.mark} for the **[U.S.]{.mark} [military]{.mark}** while only
4,500 worked for the Weather Bureau]{.underline}."145 While the field of
[meteorology was useful and important for all manner of
reasons]{.underline}, [the mid-20th century was **overwhelmingly
focused** on how weather was **applicable in wartime
situations**]{.underline}. Based on the research accomplished in the
prior two decades, [scientists had developed a much better understanding
of cloud seeding.]{.underline} Through their research, they determined
silver iodide to be the most promising material to generate
precipitation. [The **[US military]{.mark}**, after its years of
preparation, deployed its [**first use of offensive**
**weather**]{.mark} **manipulation** using silver iodide
between]{.underline} 1967 and 1972 [**[against]{.mark}** the Democratic
Republic of **Vietnam**]{.underline}.146

During this time, the [US [Air Force engaged]{.mark} in over 2,[000
attempts]{.mark} at offensive cloud seeding, known as Operation
Popeye.]{.underline} These missions were conducted with the **[[express
permission]{.underline}]{.mark}** of both presidents **[[Lyndon
B.]{.mark} [Johnson and Richard]{.mark} [Nixon]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
but were [[kept]{.mark} [secret]{.mark} from the rest of the world, even
though they operated out of a Thai military base]{.underline}.147
However, [while the US made advances in meteorological
knowledge]{.underline}, the experts in the field encountered
difficulties in their attempt to predict and measure the effects their
work had on weather.148 [Once again, climate **[scientists]{.mark}**
continued to [**overestimate** their **ability**]{.mark} to
[control]{.mark} or even discernibly influence the [weather]{.mark}, as
minor advances were insufficient to gain effective control]{.underline}.
Amongst the military leaders in Vietnam, there was a [cloud of
uncertainty over whether Operation Popeye made an impact of any
measurable significance]{.underline}, and General William
[Westmoreland]{.underline} (1914-2005) [believed]{.underline} it caused
["no appreciable increase" in rainfall]{.underline}.149 Much more
[[important]{.mark} than the effectiveness of Popeye was the fallout
caused by its discovery]{.underline}. The general
[[public]{.underline}]{.mark}, upon hearing of the project in the 1971
Pentagon Papers, [believed]{.mark} the [military's [manipulation]{.mark}
of weather was an [unacceptable tactic]{.mark}]{.underline}, and some
observers described environmental warfare as potentially genocidal.150
The [uncovering of militarized weather manipulation became an
international embarrassment for the US, and Soviet politicians
capitalised on the incident as a means of disgracing their
rival]{.underline}s, while incidentally causing a de-escalation in
weaponized weather research. Soon after the information became public,
the [USSR spearheaded the UN treaty that came to be known as The
Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Hostile Use of
Environmental Modification Techniques, or ENMOD, in 1977]{.underline}.
ENMOD became one of the oldest and most important documents overseeing
the legality of weather modification, and the whole ordeal significantly
contributed to the practice developing its unsavoury reputation until
the mid-2000s.151 However, [ENMOD's wording critically restricted itself
to prohibiting only aggressive use of environmental
modification]{.underline}, and stated that the UN would "not hinder the
use of environmental modification techniques for peaceful purposes."152

Operation **[[Popeye]{.mark} clearly [demonstrated]{.mark} the
[temptation to abuse climate science]{.mark}]{.underline}** by [those in
power]{.underline}. Despite its negligible impact, the [potential for
controllable weather was highly attractive for military leaders who
understood]{.underline} the importance that [weather events had played
in the history of warfare.]{.underline} Moreover, by [the 1960s, the US
military had already become a global leader in meteorological
research;]{.underline} the [influence of the]{.underline} **[military
was able to pervade the entire field.]{.underline}** Not only that, but
Popeye's use in the [[Vietnam war]{.underline}
[demonstrated]{.underline}]{.mark} how [readily [climate
science]{.mark}]{.underline} [could be [put to use in a war]{.mark} in
[service]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [Western colonial military
hegemony]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although this [episode disgraced
weather]{.underline} modification in the context of warfare, it did not
signal the end of the US military as chief patron for the future of
geoengineering. [ENMOD, which continues to remain in effect, forced the
scientists involved to discover new applications for their research, and
in the latter half of the 20th century, climate change answered their
need.]{.underline}

[Governance is a central theme when it comes to **SAI**]{.underline} and
**[other geoengineering]{.underline}** alternatives. It
[reflects]{.underline} how [knowledge, power, authority, decision-making
processes,]{.underline} and [visions for the future]{.underline} are
organized to address different challenges. I am inspired here by
Foucault's discussion on biopower (cf. Foucault, 1977/2007), what
mechanisms of power, knowledge, and security can be traced in relation
to geoengineering. I will elaborate on how it is operating in current
constructions and proposals to mitigate -- or at least contain -- major
transformations and impacts caused by the climate crisis through the
notion of apparatus of security

7.1 International Cooperation [Geoengineering]{.underline} is being
[suggested precisely because governments]{.underline} have [failed to
address]{.underline} [climate]{.underline} change over the past five
decades41. Given this failure of governance then, the problems
surrounding the governance of geoengineering also is daunting. [Once
tested out and deployed at a local or, should it be possible, global
level, who will own and govern that tool on which all the human and
non-human world would be dependent]{.underline}? [**[Two main
concerns]{.mark}** permeate]{.underline} the [scenario]{.underline} of
an actual [[deployment]{.underline}]{.mark} of the technology: the
[[responsibility attributed]{.mark} and the [fragmentation of
international politics]{.mark}. The first is posed by Corner and
Pidgeon]{.underline} (2010) and complemented by Stacy van DeVeer in our
interview: [**[distinguishing between extreme]{.mark}**
**[events]{.mark}** as a result of [climate change]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
unforeseen [negative effects of SAI]{.mark} deployment]{.underline}.
This uncertainty makes it [[difficult]{.mark} to [assess]{.mark}
potential [disasters]{.mark} if stratospheric aerosol deployment were to
start]{.underline}. Van DeVeer asks, "How will we know whether or not
the bad things that happen in the world are as a result of the changing
climate \[...\] or the result of the solar radiation management?" [SAI
can be extremely contentious, especially in a future where extreme
events are projected to become more frequent and more
intense.]{.underline} Another example is how, in the [**[case]{.mark}**
of a [nation]{.mark} [supporting deployment]{.mark}, were to proceed
**[unilaterally with SAI]{.mark}** while [neighboring countries]{.mark}
[opposed]{.mark} it, [tensions]{.mark} would [likely
**escalate**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Corner and Pidgeon (2010: 30) also
observed, "while similar disputes might be envisioned over the uneven
distribution of climatic changes from unabated greenhouse gas emissions,
**[the act of geoengineering might well be considered more problematic
than doing nothing]{.underline}**." The [[second concern]{.mark} has to
do with the [possibility]{.mark} of achieving [international
cooperation]{.mark} toward a responsible and democratic deployment of
SAI.]{.underline} The [fragmentation]{.underline} and divisiveness of
modern politics and [policymaking when it comes to climate change is but
one example of the geopolitical challenges]{.underline}. The [[unstable
geopolitical scenario]{.mark}]{.underline} and the [[lack]{.mark} of
ethical [commitments]{.mark}]{.underline} from negotiators are raised by
Alf Hornborg, Kevin Anderson, and Stacy van DeVeer as concerns toward
SAI. Practices of colonization, exploitation, hegemony, and power as
discussed in previous chapters all contribute to a complex and
challenging context that prevents a coordinated and cooperative
international governance of SAI. [Although the [financial costs]{.mark}
of deploying aerosols in the stratosphere are relatively
[low]{.mark}]{.underline}, for van DeVeer the [[technology]{.mark} is
[costly]{.mark} because it would be **[politically]{.mark}
[contentious]{.mark}**:]{.underline} It would [[necessitate]{.mark} a
[centralized authority]{.mark} to coordinate and manage]{.underline}.
And for me, all of those things are very bad signs. I don\'t know of
another kind of global technological project that is global in scale,
really well coordinated, \[which is\] particularly democratic.42 Ryan
Carolan discusses more in-depth how [[SAI]{.mark} is usually [justified
on]{.mark} a narrow [cost-benefit basis]{.mark} and [illustrates]{.mark}
the [bigger costs geoengineering]{.mark}]{.underline} could
[[pose]{.mark} if say geoengineering would become a [**smokescreen fo**r
**governments** and businesses to **delay
decarbonization**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is a common argument that
was brought forth already by Schelling in 1996 who warned that it might
threaten the geopolitical order (Schelling 1996). Today, the 'threat' of
geopolitical instability created in such scenarios appears to be the
least severe of possible negative outcomes.

**[1NC\-\--AT: Tipping points]{.underline}**

**Climate tipping point studies are wrong. Uncertainties in data mean we
will never be able to be certain and you should doubt aff ev.**

**Ben-Yami et al. 24**\-\--Master of Science in Astrophysics from the
University of Cambridge and researcher for the Technical University of
Munich. (Maya, Andreas Morr, Sebastian Bathiany, and Niklas Boers;

components from historical data", Science Advances, 8/2/24,

sh

Regardless of the Earth system component under consideration, [it is
inevitable that at least some of the assumptions discussed above will be
broken in reality and that the types of **uncertainties addressed in
this work will indeed arise when attempting to extrapolate tipping
time** from past historical dat]{.underline}a. First, simplified
modeling assumptions will almost always be necessary for extrapolation,
since the future behavior of the system will be different depending on
the governing dynamics. Past data can inform us about the relevant
model, but typically, many different models can match the data, as seen
above. Second, the problem of finding a time series that accurately
represents the dynamics of the system is common to all tipping elements.
Last, [the problems caused by nonstationary data coverage and data
processing methods described above are unavoidable]{.underline}, since
data processing is always necessary to assimilate and calibrate
observations and proxies, especially for longer records.

However[, it is important to emphasize that the criticisms in this work
apply to attempts to predict the exact tipping time of tipping
elements]{.underline} such as the AMOC, based on extrapolating from
uncertain data. CSD detection in terms of trends in robust indicators
such as the autocorrelation or the restoring rate is much less sensitive
to the discussed uncertainties, whereas the variance should indeed be
used with caution (8, 25, 26). In principle, CSD is applicable to any
sort of dynamical system that is approaching a transition induced by a
codimension one bifurcation. In addition, fingerprints that are not an
exact representation of a dynamical system will still show CSD as long
as the stability of the subsystem they represent is connected to the
stability of the overall system. Crucially, the uncertainties presented
in this work can be taken into account by using multiple different
fingerprints and propagating the dataset uncertainties to the CSD
analysis. Such an analysis has already been applied to the AMOC by
Ben-Yami et al. (26), who found that CSD in AMOC fingerprints in terms
of a restoring rate tending toward zero, is still significant although
the trends in the CSD indicators have a large spread. Taking into
account the same observational uncertainty spread for the tipping time,
however, gives time ranges from 2050 to infinity, practically making
this prediction noninformative. This is [because **tipping time
prediction is** not only **more sensitive to uncertainties** but also
relies on more assumptions and in particular presumes that there will be
a tipping time in the future. Therefore, for the prediction method to be
useful, it needs to narrow down the future range of tipping times to an
informative range.]{.underline} In contrast, a detection of CSD does not
make statements about future tipping, only about the fact that the
system is now less stable than it was in the past.

Although the example we put most focus on was the predicted tipping time
of the AMOC, the work of Boers and Rypdal (2021) (9) (hereafter BR21)
could also be interpreted as a prediction of tipping time for the
central-western part of the GIS. The same kinds of uncertainties apply
to that work. BR21 derive the potential landscape of the ice sheet
height by fitting a previously introduced nonlinear model (71), which
makes many assumptions. The change in ice sheet height is calculated
from average annual melt rates obtained from three ice cores in
central-western Greenland, and in addition to uncertainties in the
underlying data that are difficult to quantify, it is highly uncertain
how well this location represents the whole ice sheet (49). A potential
tipping time could be identified with the bifurcation point of the
fitted model (red vertical dashed line in figure 3 of BR21). However,
the uncertainties from the assumptions of the simplified model and the
reconstruction uncertainties imply that the estimated bifurcation point
should not be understood as an estimate of the actual critical threshold
and should certainly not be translated into a tipping time (9).

We have discussed [**multiple sources of uncertainty** in the prediction
of future tipping times of Earth system components]{.underline}. These
uncertainties are as follows:

[1) The modeling assumptions underlying the methods for tipping time
estimation]{.underline}

[2) The viability of extrapolating past forcing trends into the
future]{.underline}

3\) The reliability of using indirect fingerprints to predict tipping
times of climate tipping elements

[4) The uncertainties that arise from the bias and preprocessing in
observational datasets with measurement uncertainties and
gaps]{.underline}

The latter two points above may be addressed in time by improved Earth
system observations and waiting (possibly for hundreds of years,
depending on the characteristic timescale of the system) until
sufficiently long records are available. Regarding the first point, it
[is unclear whether the highly nonlinear and complex dynamics governing
the proposed tipping elements will ever be reliably modeled at the
accuracy needed for tipping time prediction]{.underline}. Last,
regarding the second point, [**it will never be possible to know the
change in future forcing, so any extrapolation will always be
uncertain** as it would assume a specific future scenario.]{.underline}

In addition, we have described in detail how these uncertainties
manifest for the specific example of predicting a future AMOC tipping
time, using the MLE method introduced by DD23 (14): 1) The modeling
assumptions underlying DD23's MLE method for tipping time predictions
are too simple and do not necessarily hold for the AMOC. We have shown
that breaking these assumptions by, e.g., changing the dynamical model
for the AMOC or the model for the forcing introduces large biases in the
tipping time estimation (Fig. 4). In particular, their method also
predicts a tipping time for a linear model that cannot tip, if forced by
red noise with increasing correlation strength. 2) The connection of the
SPG-based AMOC fingerprint (computed from SSTs) to the AMOC is uncertain
and nonstationary and therefore is problematic for exact predictions of
tipping times. Using different SST fingerprints with the HadISST dataset
can change the predicted tipping time by 70 years (table S2). 3) The
inherent uncertainties of SST datasets and the preprocessing methods
used to fill in missing data can be nonstationary and thus affect
higher-order statistics such as the variance or autocorrelation. In
particular, the HadISST dataset used by DD23 is known to have an
artificial variance increase. Using different SST datasets and their
uncertainty ensembles, the tipping time varies by thousands of years
(tables S1 and S2). In the foreseeable future, points 2 and 3 will
essentially form impassable barriers to predicting the time of a future
AMOC collapse from historical data. The available data are simply not
accurate or precise enough to make such an extrapolation.

In conclusion, we showed that [the **uncertainties** discussed in this
work **are too large to allow for reliable estimates of the tipping time
of major Earth system tipping elements**, **including** the AMOC, **the
polar ice sheets**, or tropical rainforests, based on extrapolating
results from historical data. We emphasize that these
uncertainties,]{.underline} originating from underlying modeling or
mechanistic assumptions as well as from the used empirical data[, need
to be taken into account and propagated thoroughly before attempting to
estimate a future tipping time of any potential Earth system tipping
element.]{.underline}

3 Controversy Arisen Due to Increased Observations of Non-Negative
Effects [The **[pessimistic view]{.mark} [that ocean acidification would
jeopardize]{.mark}** the **[survival]{.mark}**]{.underline} of
calcifiers in the near future [appears to **become a common belief**
among marine scientists]{.underline} as it is widely written in
textbooks and disseminated in media.\[39\] However[, **this view** seems
to **[focus disproportionately on]{.mark}** the **[studies showing
negative effects]{.mark}**, while those showing neutral or positive
effects are rarely emphasized]{.underline}. Negative results (i.e.,
showing minimal or no effects) are also less likely to be published than
positive results. [These reasons would create a perception bias about
the effects of ocean acidification]{.underline} on calcifiers. On the
other hand, some early [**[studies infer]{.mark} the** ecological
**[consequences]{.mark}** of ocean acidification from the biological
responses shown **[at extreme CO2 levels]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\[29,
33, 40, 41\] Despite being not quite ecologically relevant, the
implications made in these studies would generate a very negative
perception of ocean acidification. When considering the plausible RCP6.0
scenario (≈700 ppm atmospheric CO2), or even less plausible RCP8.5
scenario (≈1000 ppm atmospheric CO2) by the year 2100, the impacts of
ocean acidification on calcifiers may be less deleterious than initially
thought. Furthermore, [short-term experiments of only a few days to
weeks **[using unrealistic methods]{.mark}**]{.underline}, such as the
addition of hydrochloric acid or manipulation of total alkalinity to
lower seawater pH, are often conducted in early studies,\[26, 27, 42\]
[which tend to **[elicit stress responses]{.mark}** of the tested
organisms [and]{.mark} thus [create a negative perception]{.mark} of
ocean acidification]{.underline}. Instead, these short-term experiments
may better represent pulse acidification events that occur in coastal
ecosystems. In fact[, growing evidence shows that [calcifiers]{.mark}
can [maintain growth]{.mark} and calcification [under]{.mark}
near-future ocean [acidification]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example,
shell weight and shell diameter of foraminifera Baculogypsina
sphaerulata, Calcarina gaudichaudii and Amphisorus hemprichii can be
maintained or even boosted at 770 μatm CO2 following 12 week
exposure;\[43\] mussel Mytilus edulis reared at pH 7.7 for 7 weeks has
normal somatic growth and shell growth without shell dissolution;\[44\]
calcification of corals Stylophora pistillata and Acropora muricata is
unaffected by ocean acidification at pH 7.8;\[45\] sea urchin
Echinometra sp. has enhanced growth after 17 month exposure at natural
volcanic CO2 vents (pH 7.73), indicating its capacity to persist in the
acidifying ocean.\[46\] Apart from growth and calcification,
non-negative responses to near-future ocean acidification have been
observed in various traits. For example, photosynthetic efficiency,
symbiont density, and chlorophyll content of corals Acropora digitifera,
Montipora digitata, and Porites cylindrica are unaffected by acidified
seawater (1000 μatm CO2) after 26 day exposure;\[47\] calcifying algae
Halimeda cuneata, Padina gymnospora, and Tricleocarpa cylindrica
cultured at pH 7.85 for 24 d can maintain carbonic anhydrase activity
and photosynthetic efficiency;\[48\] sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus
can maintain the mechanical strength of tests at pH 7.78 under both
laboratory and field conditions;\[49\] gastropod Austrocochlea
concamerata upregulates respiration rates at 940 ppm CO2, whereas [shell
organic matter content, mechanical strength, crystallinity and body
condition are maintained.\[50\] The above examples unequivocally show
that **some [calcifiers are tolerant]{.mark} to acidified seawater**,
[which]{.mark} not only [implies]{.mark} their [adaptability]{.mark} to
near-future ocean acidification, but also draws concerns over
experimental **confirmation of prevailing negative
effects**.]{.underline} The capacity of some calcifiers to sustain
calcification under ocean acidification seems counter-intuitive and is
contradictory to the early paradigm,\[5, 6\] suggesting that seawater
carbonate chemistry is not strongly associated with calcification.
Indeed, calcification is a physiological process where calcifiers per se
can create an optimal alkaline condition for precipitating CaCO3
minerals at the calcification site. It is also important to note that
CO32− in seawater is not directly utilized, but HCO3− or
metabolically-produced CO2, by calcifiers for calcification,\[51, 52\]
implying that seawater Ω is not the key driver of calcification. This
concept can help explain why some calcifiers can maintain or even
enhance calcification under carbonate undersaturated conditions.\[53\]
Given the increased observations of non-negative effects as well as
rapid development of ocean acidification research in the last decade,
time has come to reassess the effects of ocean acidification on
calcifiers systematically, which can be achieved by conducting a
meta-analysis that identifies the key traits, taxa and life stages that
are sensitive or resistant to ocean acidification. By being open to
non-negative effects, which conflicts the widely recognized paradigm of
negative effects, this systematic review and meta-analysis can offer new
directions for the advancement of knowledge and progress in ocean
acidification research. 4 Meta-Analysis on the Effects of Ocean
Acidification on Calcifiers Data Collection and Selection Criteria for
the Meta-Analysis To gather the data from relevant studies assessing
biological responses of calcifiers to ocean acidification, an exhaustive
literature review was performed using the search engine Google Scholar,
where keywords "carbon dioxide," "marine organism," "calcification" and
"ocean acidification" were input for each search per year from 1998 to
2020 using custom range function. A total of 1000 search results, sorted
by relevance, were obtained per year (i.e., a total of 23 000 search
results for 23 years). A two-step screening process for all search
results was performed to include relevant studies for the meta-analysis
(Figure S1, Supporting Information for the PRISMA flow diagram). First,
we only considered peer-reviewed journal articles and excluded those
without reporting biological responses of calcifiers to ocean
acidification after reading the abstract. Then, we checked the details
of all the studies passing the first screening step and excluded those
studies if they fail to meet the selection criteria for the
meta-analysis, which are described as follows. Studies were excluded if
variance (e.g., standard deviation, standard error, and 95% confidence
interval) was not reported in the main text or Supporting Information,
or could not be obtained through calculation. Since not all marine algae
are able to produce CaCO3 minerals, we only included calcifying algae
for the meta-analysis by checking the biology of species in the
literature when necessary. Some crustaceans, such as krill and copepods,
do not produce CaCO3 as the structural material; therefore, we only
included those crustaceans which can produce heavily calcified
structures (e.g., shrimps, crabs, and lobsters). Field studies were
included for the meta-analysis if the seawater conditions were mainly
influenced by CO2 concentrations, whereas other environmental variables
(e.g., salinity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen concentrations) were
comparable to the ambient levels. As for laboratory studies, we included
those using either CO2 aeration or acid--base addition method to
manipulate seawater pH.\[54\] For those studies employing a factorial
design with variables in addition to pH or CO2 concentration (e.g.,
salinity, temperature, light intensity, dissolved oxygen concentration,
food availability, and nutrient concentration), we only included the
treatments with these variables maintained at the ambient level so that
the selected data are only subject to pH or CO2 concentration. When the
ambient food/nutrient concentration was not reported, we chose the
fed/high nutrient treatment as the experimental organisms can be
stressed by starvation or malnutrition that confounds interpretation.
For those laboratory studies exploring the effects of ocean
acidification on multiple species and their interactions (e.g.,
predator--prey interaction, intra- and interspecific competition), we
excluded the treatments influenced by species interactions. Some studies
examined biological responses to ocean acidification using the same
species collected from different locations or populations. The data from
each location or population were included in the meta-analysis because
they are independent. For those laboratory studies with time-series
measurements, we collected the data from the last time point unless
severe mortality was observed (either control or acidified treatment)
that can cause large errors for comparisons. In this case, we chose the
time point that is the closest to the nominal end point without severe
mortality for both control or acidified treatments. A few studies
investigated the effect of pH fluctuations on biological responses. We
only selected the data from the treatments with static pH level. We
included studies on carry-over effect and transgenerational effect, but
only the data from treatments with seawater conditions maintained across
life stages or generations were chosen. While data extraction was done
by the first author, all authors were involved in the initial step of
this process by extracting data from the same papers (n = 20) and
cross-checking the results. This step can ensure that the same protocol
was used to minimize extractor bias. In the meta-analysis, we compared
the biological responses of calcifiers caused by pH reduction, which
allows best standardized comparisons among studies,\[37\] despite the
inevitable differences in total alkalinity and pCO2 (Supporting
Information). Besides, pH is a sensible indicator of the impact of ocean
acidification on calcifiers because pH (a measure of H+ concentration)
rather than pCO2 can directly affect the acid--base balance of
calcifiers for calcification. Four categories of seawater acidity with a
pH range were used: current (pH 8.2-- 7.91), near-future (pH 7.90--
7.61), far-future (pH 7.60--7.21) and extreme (pH ≤ 7.20). These pH
ranges were commonly used in the literature to represent the respective
category, where the near-future and far-future levels are based on the
prediction models.\[1\] Coastal acidification can particularly be
represented by the far-future and extreme levels. In each study, we also
checked the difference in seawater pH between control (i.e., ambient pH
level) and acidified treatments to ensure correct categorization. The
ambient pH level was designated by authors, but we excluded those
studies using abnormally low pH (or high CO2 level) for the control,
which possibly results from the impact of upwelling in field sites or
acid sulfate soils in coastal areas. To ensure more accurate comparisons
of biological responses, we did not mix plausibly related variables to
create response categories because the direction of change among these
variables is not always the same. For example, we did not create a
category "photosynthesis" by pooling the data of photosynthetic rate and
photosynthetic efficiency for the meta-analysis. Instead, we reported
these responses separately. Similarly, "growth" was classified into two
types based on 1) change in body size and 2) change in body weight
because they do not necessarily show the same direction of change.
Concerning the change in body size, we chose the variable with the
largest number of dimensions (i.e., volume \> area \> length) as
possible to better reflect growth in body size. Only one of these growth
variables was included for the meta-analysis to avoid pseudo-replication
(e.g., length data excluded when area data included). Change in shell or
skeletal size may not perfectly indicate calcification as mineral
density or porosity should be taken into account; therefore, we defined
calcification based on the weight change in CaCO3 minerals. We did not
include mortality (or survival) of juveniles/adults in the meta-analysis
because it depends strongly on experimental duration and is difficult to
standardize this duration with the life span of organisms among studies.
Yet, larval mortality was included and converted to survival given by:
1---mortality. Data Analysis [To estimate the effect of ocean
acidification on the biological responses]{.underline} of calcifiers,
[we calculated Hedges' g, which is the bias-corrected standardized mean
difference between the control]{.underline} (i.e., ambient pH level)
[and treatment]{.underline} (i.e., reduced pH level). Hedges' g is
widely used as a measure of effect size in academic research and
calculated using the following formula:\[55\] where \[xt\] and \[xc\]
are the mean in treatment and control, respectively; n is the sample
size; s is the standard deviation; J is a correction factor for the bias
due to small sample size and is given by: [To account for the inequality
in study variance, effect sizes were weighted by the inverse of the
sampling variance]{.underline}, where the variance for each effect size
(Vg) is calculated using the following formula: Meta-analysis was
conducted to estimate the effects of ocean acidification on the commonly
measured biological responses of calcifiers using software JASP 0.15
(University of Amsterdam, Netherlands), which is based on the metafor
package for R. Since experimental design and species vary across
studies, random-effect model was used to enable heterogeneity of true
effect sizes among the studies.\[57\] The pooled effect sizes with the
associated 95% confidence intervals were shown in a forest plot for each
biological response. Effect sizes are generally interpreted as follows:
\|g\| \< 0.2 (small); 0.2 ≤ \|g\| \< 0.5 (medium); 0.5 ≤ \|g\| \< 0.8
(large); \|g\| ≥ 0.8 (very large).\[56\] Effect sizes are significant
when their 95% confidence intervals did not overlap with zero.
[Publication bias, caused by selective publication of articles reporting
significant effects over those reporting nonsignificant effects, may
distort meta-analysis results.\[]{.underline}56\] To identify potential
publication bias, funnel plots were used to visualize the outliers among
studies and Egger\'s regression test was applied to evaluate funnel plot
asymmetry. While it is suggested to remove the outliers causing funnel
plot asymmetry, careful judgment was made because the heterogeneity
among studies can be true, especially considering the differences in
physiology among species. Thus, funnel plot asymmetry does not
necessarily indicate publication bias and inappropriate use of funnel
plots can even worsen the meta-analysis results.\[58\] After considering
the outliers shown in funnel plots and checking the quality control of
the associated studies, we only removed those outliers that can
substantially drive funnel plot asymmetry (typically \|g\| ≥ 7 due to
large treatment effect, but unusually small standard deviations within
each group). Results [Our meta-analysis comprises 985 studies with a
total of 5153 observations]{.underline} (68 outliers excluded) from
various calcifiers in different life stages, where bivalves, corals, sea
urchins, gastropods, and calcifying algae are the five most studied taxa
(Supporting Information). According to mobility and mode of life,
calcifiers are classified into five groups, including 1) planktonic
calcifiers, 2) sessile photosynthetic calcifiers, 3) sessile
filter-feeding calcifiers, 4) benthic calcifiers of low mobility, and 5)
highly mobile calcifiers. 4.3.1 Planktonic Calcifiers
[Coccolithophores]{.underline} are the most studied planktonic
calcifiers. Their growth, PIC (i.e., an indicator of CaCO3 production)
and coccolith size are reduced by near-future ocean acidification (pH
7.90--7.61), but cell density, photosynthetic rate, POC, and PON are
promoted (Figure 1a). The reduction in growth and PIC is slightly
intensified by far-future ocean acidification (pH 7.60--7.21).
[Regarding foraminifera, only CaCO3 production is impaired]{.underline}
by ocean acidification, whereas [other variables (e.g., growth,
respiration rate, and photosynthetic rate) remain unchanged]{.underline}
(Figure 1b). Pteropods appear to be susceptible to ocean acidification
in view of the reduced growth in size and calcification (Figure 1c).
However, the [reduction in calcification is insignificant due to the
large variation among the few numbers of observations]{.underline}.

Photosynthetic Calcifiers Sponges are rarely studied in ocean
acidification research. Based on the few numbers of observations,
[[sponges]{.mark} [are]{.mark} found to be generally
[insensitive]{.mark} to ocean acidification,]{.underline} except that
their spicules can be eroded by acidified seawater at a higher rate
(Figure 2a). Calcifying algae appear to be vulnerable to ocean
acidification in view of the decrease in growth, calcifying fluid pH,
CaCO3 production, skeletal Ca2+ content, and chlorophyll a content
(Figure 2b). Ocean acidification at the far-future level further reduces
CaCO3 production, and lowers respiration rate and photosynthetic
efficiency in terms of Fv/Fm. [Carbonic anhydrase activity, nitrogen
content, and C/N ratio remain unchanged under ocean
acidification.]{.underline} Figure 2 Effects of ocean acidification on

studied in ocean acidification research, but studies on their early life
stages are scant. Based on the few numbers of observations, only larval
settlement and survival rate are reduced by ocean acidification, whereas
other variables (e.g., fertilization rate, [developmental]{.mark}
[success]{.mark}, larval [growth]{.mark}, [respiration]{.mark} rate, and
symbiont density) [remain unaltered]{.mark}]{.underline} (Figure 2c).
Adult corals are sensitive to ocean acidification as many variables,
including growth, calcifying fluid pH, CaCO3 production, skeletal
density, and symbiont density, are negatively affected especially at the
far-future level of acidification (Figure 2d). Yet, [several
physiological variables (e.g., respiration and photosynthesis) and

[unaffected]{.mark} by ocean acidification.]{.underline} 4.3.3 Sessile
Filter-Feeding Calcifiers Bryozoans are seldom used as the study
organism for ocean acidification research. Based on the currently
available observations in the literature, [bryozoans are found to be
tolerant to ocean acidification]{.underline} (Figure 3a[).
[Barnacles]{.mark} [are]{.mark} also [resistant]{.mark} to ocean
acidification since no variable is negatively affected]{.underline}
[(]{.underline}Figure 3b). **[[Instead, CaCO3 production is boosted by

indicates no effect. Significant difference is indicated by an asterisk
when the 95% confidence interval does not overlap the vertical dashed
line. CA activity: carbonic anhydrase activity. [[Bivalves]{.mark}
(e.g., oysters, mussels, clams and scallops; brachiopods]{.underline}
included given the similar biological features as bivalves) are the most
studied group of calcifiers in ocean acidification research. Bivalve
embryos/larvae are susceptible to pH reduction because many variables,
such as fertilization success, hatching rate, larval development rate,
growth, metamorphosis and survival, are reduced even by near-future
ocean acidification (Figure 3c). Their vulnerability generally increases
with the degree of acidification. In contrast, [juvenile/adult bivalves
**[are]{.mark} quite [tolerant]{.mark} to**]{.underline} [near-future
ocean **acidification** as many variables remain unaffected, such as
respiration, condition index and byssus parameters]{.underline} (Figure
3d). Yet, slight reduction is observed in growth, CaCO3 production,
feeding performance, and fracture resistance of shells. Ocean
acidification at the far-future level can usually exacerbate these
adverse effects. Shell organic matter and calcite to aragonite ratio are
slightly elevated by near-future acidification. Polychaetes are rarely
studied in ocean acidification research and thus the number of
observations is rather low. CaCO3 production and shell density of
polychaetes are reduced by ocean acidification (Figure 3e). 4.3.4
Benthic Calcifiers of Low Mobility Gastropod embryos/larvae are
sensitive to near-future ocean acidification, indicated by the decreased
hatching rate, larval developmental rate, growth, metamorphosis success,
feeding performance and survival, as well as increased hatching time and
abnormal larval development (Figure 4a). These negative effects are
often aggravated by the far-future level of acidification. In [contrast,
juvenile/adult gastropods are more tolerant to near-future ocean
acidification, despite the mild reduction in growth and CaCO3
production]{.underline} (Figure 4b). Ocean acidification at the
far-future level can undermine growth, CaCO3 production and shell
thickness. Shell organic matter, calcite to aragonite ratio and Mg/Ca
ratio tend to be elevated by ocean acidification. Figure 4 Effects of

stars, brittle stars, and sea cucumbers included in this meta-analysis)
[are generally tolerant to near-future ocean acidification as only
growth in weight and coelomic fluid pH are slightly reduced]{.underline}
(Figure 4c). However, ocean acidification at the far-future level can
pose obvious negative effects on fertilization success, larval growth,
and coelomic fluid pH. Sea urchins are separated from the group
"Echinoderms" not only because they are more frequently used than other
echinoderms for ocean acidification research, but also because they have
to build solid calcareous structures to cover their whole body, which
differs from other echinoderms. Sea urchin embryos/larvae are vulnerable
to near-future ocean acidification that poses adverse effects on many
variables, such as fertilization success, larval developmental rate,
growth, CaCO3 production, and survival (Figure 4d). Increased abnormal
embryonic and larval development due to increased arm asymmetry are also
observed. All these negative effects are usually intensified by a higher
degree of acidification. In contrast, juvenile/adult sea urchins are
more resistant to ocean acidification as only few variables are
negatively affected, such as growth in weight, test thickness, spine
mechanical strength, and feeding performance (Figure 4e). 4.3.5 Highly
Mobile Calcifiers **[[Crustaceans]{.mark} (]{.underline}**e.g.,

Acidification on Growth and Calcification [For calcifiers, growth and
calcification are regarded as the two key variables impacted by ocean
acidification. However, this notion is partially influenced by the
results of [previous]{.mark} [studies]{.mark} [using extreme pH
levels]{.mark}, which would have [overestimate]{.mark}d the [negative
effects of]{.mark} ocean [acidification]{.mark}]{.underline}. As such,
we gathered the data from studies that evaluate the effects of
near-future level of acidification (pH 7.90--7.61) on calcification,
juvenile/adult growth, and larval growth in various taxa of calcifiers.
In each study, t-test was used to compare these responses between the
control and acidified treatment (i.e., ambient pH vs near-future pH) at
a significance level of p ≤ 0.05. Considering the observations across
all taxa, only 29.6% of calcifiers respond negatively to ocean
acidification in calcification, while 66.4% of them have a neutral
response (Figure 6a[). Negative responses are not frequently
observed]{.underline} in many taxa (\<20%), including bryozoans,
barnacles, polychaetes, echinoderms, sea urchins, crustaceans, and
cephalopods. Similar observations as calcification are found in
juvenile/adult growth, where 26.1% and 67.4% of calcifiers across all
taxa show a negative response and neutral response, respectively (Figure
6b). [Many taxa have a high percentage of non-negative responses

### 1NC \-\-- Trump Rolls Back

**Trump hates climate science -- he'll make the plan ineffective.**

Scott **Waldman 25** Scott covers the White House as well as climate
policy and politics. Before he joined E&E News, he worked at Politico
New York, the Albany Times Union, the Erie Times-News and The Baltimore
Sun. His work also has appeared in Scientific American and Science
magazine. Waldman holds a master's degree in journalism from Syracuse
University and a bachelor's degree from Earlham College. "How Trump's
assault on science is blinding America to climate change" E&E by
POLITICO 6/16
https://www.eenews.net/articles/how-trumps-assault-on-science-is-blinding-america-to-climate-change/

President Donald [Trump long ago decided climate change was a
"hoax."]{.underline} Now his administration is trying to silence
government research that proves him wrong.

Since Trump returned to the White House in January, his [administration
has fired or let go hundreds of climate and weather
scientists]{.underline} --- and **[cut ties to hundreds
more]{.underline}** who work in academia or the private sector.

His team has [eliminated]{.underline} major climate programs, frozen or
cut [grants for climate research]{.underline} and moved to [shutter
EPA's greenhouse gas reporting program]{.underline}. The Trump
administration has slow-walked climate-related contracts --- including
one for the upkeep of two polar weather satellites. And it's begun to
wall off the United States from international climate cooperation.

That's not all.

Trump's blitzkrieg on federal climate work is only a start --- as his
[budget strategy calls for even deeper cuts in the months and years
ahead]{.underline}. That includes **[billions of dollars in cuts to
climate]{.underline}** and weather research [at NOAA and
NASA]{.underline}, widely considered two of the world's top science
agencies.

All told, it's an unprecedented [assault on humanity's understanding of
how global warming is transforming the planet,]{.underline} scientists
say. And they warn that Trump's actions will blind the United States and
the world to the ways people are rapidly heating the planet by burning
fossil fuels.

"They certainly are trying to create lasting damage," said Andrew
Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University.

The White House has framed the moves as cost-cutting measures designed
to shrink the size of government. Trump officials have said too that a
retreat from climate science is necessary, as the research underpins
regulations that could hinder U.S. production of fossil fuels --- a top
goal of the administration.

"Climate alarmism has had a terrible impact on human lives and freedom,"
Energy Secretary Chris Wright wrote Thursday on the social media site X.
"It belongs in the ash heap of history."

Wright, who led a fracking services company before joining the
administration, added, "Hydrocarbons are and will continue to be
essential to improving the wealth, health, and lives of all human
beings."

The White House echoed that sentiment in response to questions that
POLITICO's E&E News sent to NOAA, NASA and the Office of Management and
Budget.

"The last Administration wasted billions on 'research' and fake science
in Green New Scam and culturally Marxist programs," OMB spokesperson
Rachel Cauley said.

"Under President Trump, our science agencies are actually doing science
again," she added.

But scientists say the Trump team is doing just the opposite by
jettisoning climate scientists and abandoning respected climate
programs. Among the actions taken so far by administration:

[Dismissing hundreds of scientists who were working on the next version
of the National Climate Assessment]{.underline}, a congressionally
mandated report that is used to prepare U.S. communities for extreme
weather and sea-level rise.

Dismantling the U.S. Global Change Research Program, a 35-year-old
effort to track global climate change that was established by Congress
and signed into law by President George H.W. Bush.

Eliminating the State Department's Office of Global Change, which
oversees climate negotiations.

For U.S. climate science, each week of the Trump administration seems to
bring new losses, by design.

The National Science Foundation's funding for climate research at
universities has now evaporated after severe Trump administration cuts.

Spacecraft in orbit that have cost billions of dollars to launch --- and
a fraction of the cost to maintain --- will be mothballed if they
monitor climate change, under Trump's budget proposal.

NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, one of the world's leading
space and climate research labs, was kicked out of its longtime
building. The scientists who work there now face an uncertain future
under a proposed NASA budget that cuts science research nearly in half.

"[It's humiliating and it debilitates our standing in the world
community,"]{.underline} said Michael Mann, a climate scientist at the
University of Pennsylvania and director of its Penn Center for Science,
Sustainability and the Media.

[Climate science at EPA, the CDC, and the Interior, Agriculture and
Energy departments has been **proposed for elimination**]{.underline}.
That includes research that monitors human harms from pollution,
climatic conditions that can devastate farmers' crops and the health
risks of intense heat waves.

Yet Russ Vought --- who leads the White House [OMB --- wants
more.]{.underline}

Vought is attempting to strip away Congress' budget authority and its
ability to block some of the proposed cuts to climate science.

[Agencies such as NOAA and NAS]{.underline}A have been ordered by the
White House [to freeze billions of dollars in funding **--- including
money that goes toward climate research**]{.underline} --- before
Congress has a chance to act.

And that's just a small sample of the first wave of Trump climate
attacks.

"Despite the claims to the contrary, this isn't being done to cut
costs," Mann said. "It's being done because climate science --- and
simply measuring our climate --- has proven inconvenient to certain
special interests who hold sway today in Washington."

'There will be a lot to rebuild'

Climate denialists, including conservative politicians, foundations and
think tanks that oppose regulations, long have pined for a day when the
U.S. government stops providing clear evidence that global warming poses
a threat to America's economy, national security and way of life.

With Trump, their wishes are on the way to being granted. It's the
culmination of decades of funding from the oil, gas and coal industry to
tear down climate science.

[Weakening scientific research and creating long-term damage is the
goal]{.underline}, said Steve Milloy, who was part of Trump's EPA
transition team in his first term and has spent decades trying to
shatter federal climate science and regulations.

"If Democrats ever get back in power, there will be a lot to rebuild,"
he said.

That [reconstruction likely will include pillars of the nation's climate
research infrastructure]{.underline}.

Take, for example, the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. Last month, it
measured the highest level of atmospheric carbon dioxide recorded in
modern human history, at 430.2 parts per million.

For scientists, it's a troubling benchmark. For the [Trump
administration, it may identify the observatory as another target for
cuts]{.underline} --- the facility is being considered for closure, and
its lease may be canceled.

Other data streams are in danger too. More than a dozen spacecraft or
space-based instruments that capture climate data are proposed to be
shut down in the White House spending plan.

The [Trump administration justifies cost-cutting measures such as these
by saying they're intended to stop waste, fraud and abuse.]{.underline}

But eliminating the functions of satellites already in orbit --- which
represent decades of work and billions of dollars in sunk-cost spending
--- makes neither financial nor scientific sense, said Rick Spinrad, who
served as NOAA chief during the Biden administration.

"So [many of the observations that are made in support of understanding
climate are also being made to support the more immediate weather and
ocean applications]{.underline}," he said. "To say 'there's the word
climate, shut that down' means the same satellite isn't available to
give you an improved four to five day forecast on hurricane landfall."

And it's not just that valuable data would be lost --- whatever federal
research remains will be sidelined and blocked from informing government
policy and procedure.

Last month, [Trump issued an executive order on a new "gold standard"
for scientific research that effectively **blocks much of the science**
on greenhouse gas emissions]{.underline}, human health harms from
pollution [and environmental degradation **from being used by federal
agencies**]{.underline}.

As part of that process, political appointees would effectively
determine which scientific research can be used by the federal
government.

In effect, the moves would blind the country to the consequences of the
administration's actions to cut pollution regulations and increase the
country's reliance on fossil fuels while making it harder to build out
clean energy, Texas A&M's Dessler said.

"They hate science because it leads to regulation, so they want to do
everything they can to stop science from being used to regulate," he
said.

The [plan to eradicate climate science throughout the government is
reminiscent of the way Trump and his officials attacked Covid data
collection,]{.underline} which clearly showed cases and death rates
rising in his first term, said Spinrad, the former NOAA administrator.

"The Trump administration said we can reduce the number of cases by not
testing anymore," Spinrad said. "That's what is going on here. '[We can
reduce the impact of climate change by not monitoring
anymore]{.underline}.' That's what they're saying, which is just totally
**[incomprehensible."]{.underline}**

### 2NC -- Blocks Research

**Even if they do the research -- he will make sure it won't get seen.**

Oliver **Milman 25** Oliver Milman is an environment reporter for
Guardian US. "Trump officials axed an online portal for its key climate
report" The Guardian 7/10
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/10/national-climate-assessment-published

The future of the US government's [premier climate crisis report is
perilously uncertain]{.underline} after the Trump [administration
deleted]{.underline} the website that housed the periodic, [legally
mandated assessments that have been produced by scientists]{.underline}
over the past two decades.

Five national climate assessments have been compiled since 2000 by
researchers across a dozen US government agencies and outside
scientists, providing a gold standard report to city and state
officials, as well as the general public, of global heating and its
impacts upon human health, agriculture, water supplies, air pollution
and other aspects of American life.

But although the assessments are mandated to occur every four years
under legislation passed by Congress in 1990, the [Trump administration
has axed the online portal holding the reports]{.underline}, which went
dark last week. A contract to support this work has also been torn up
and researchers who were working on the next report, due around 2027,
have been dismissed.

A copy of the latest assessment, conducted in 2023, can be found deep on
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's website. The
Guardian is replicating the report here in full in a more visible way
for the public to access.

The [2023 assessment,]{.underline} which is more than 1,800 pages long,
[warns that the "effects of human-caused climate change are already
far-reaching and worsening]{.underline} across every region of the
United States". It adds that "without rapid and deep reductions in
global greenhouse gas emissions from human activities, the risks of
accelerating sea level rise, intensifying extreme weather and other
harmful climate impacts will continue to grow."

[Nasa said it is in the process of uploading the voluminous reports on
to its servers]{.underline}, although the administration did not respond
to questions over how, or in what form, future climate assessments will
be conducted after the shuttering of the research effort.

"The [USCGRP]{.underline} website is no longer active," a Nasa
spokesperson said, in reference to the US Global Change Research
Program, [a federally funded program to coordinate climate
research]{.underline}. "All preexisting reports will be hosted on the
Nasa website, ensuring continuity of reporting."

Researchers who have worked, for free, to produce the reports expressed
concern about the future direction of the assessments under Trump, who
has called the climate crisis "a giant scam" and "bullshit" in the past.

[As president, Trump has removed mentions of climate from federal
websites, scrapped research work on environmental issues, and cut staff
and funding for weather forecasting and climate agencies]{.underline},
and has just signed a major Republican spending bill that stymies clean
energy while [providing greater support for the fossil
fuels]{.underline} that are causing dangerous global heating.

### 2NC -- Yes Roll Back

**He doesn't care about popularity -- he will roll it back.**

science and current events that shape the planet, such as wildfires,

unpopular, even with Republican voters" Yale Climate Connections 7/3
https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2025/07/trumps-climate-research-cuts-are-unpopular-even-with-republicans/

As [the Trump administration]{.underline} takes steps [to dismantle
climate research **across NASA, NOAA, the EPA,**]{.underline} and other
agencies, recent polling shows that this move is deeply unpopular.

In May 2025, registered voters were asked whether they supported or
opposed government orders that would halt research on global warming.
Voters were also asked if they supported directives that would stop
federal agencies from sharing information about global warming with the
public.

This polling is part of ongoing research on Americans' views of climate
change conducted by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication
(the publisher of this website) and the George Mason University Center
for Climate Change Communication.

President Donald [Trump is seeking to cut or eliminate numerous programs
that conduct climate research across multiple federal agencies. Budget
proposals]{.underline} for the coming year **[paint a dire
future]{.underline}** [for NOAA's climate research
programs]{.underline}. NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research
would be cut completely, along with scores of collaborative research
efforts across the country.

The Global Monitoring Laboratory on Mauna Loa, Hawaii, is among many
programs slated to end. This one is of particular significance because
it carries out the world's longest-running direct measurements of
atmospheric carbon dioxide and provided early evidence that burning
fossil fuels is altering the chemistry of our atmosphere.

The [administration's proposed budget would cancel multiple ongoing NASA
missions]{.underline} that study Earth's climate system, such as the
[Orbiting Climate Observatories]{.underline} that measure carbon dioxide
from space. [NASA's Earth science program]{.underline} would **[lose
more than half its funding.]{.underline}** Meanwhile, the Trump
administration canceled the lease for the offices that house the
agency's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which compiles the
agency's long-term temperature record that documents our warming
climate. (Full disclosure: The author of this article is a contractor
with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.)

The [Department of Defense]{.underline} is abruptly [halting access to
the nation's primary data source for monitoring global sea
ice,]{.underline} citing cybersecurity concerns. The National Snow and
Ice Data Center, which maintains a long-term record of sea ice at both
poles, has announced that its sea ice index will cease at the end of
July. This [same data stream is also crucial for hurricane forecasts,
particularly for rapidly intensifying storms.]{.underline} The data
shut-off will occur during hurricane season, posing additional risks for
coastal communities. That's prompted dire warnings from meteorologists.

[At the EPA, the administration has pushed out hundreds of
staffers]{.underline} and is in the process of dissolving the agency's
primary office for scientific research. The few research positions that
remain will be restructured to align with administration priorities, and
the agency will reassign some scientists to work on approving new
chemicals and pesticides.

These policies are widely unpopular. Ne[arly **80% of registered
voters** say they **oppose** government-imposed orders to halt climate
research, including a **majority of Republicans**]{.underline}. Even
conservative Republicans, who are most likely to approve of Trump's
policies, say they are largely against shutting down these research
programs, according to the May survey.

Americans want climate information to be shared with the public

A graph shows that most Americans oppose policies that prohibit federal
agencies from sharing information about climate change with the public

In addition to canceling climate research, the [Trump administration is
also shuttering the channels that communicate this critical information
to the public]{.underline}.

**[These moves, too, are starkly out of step with public
views]{.underline}**, even among Republicans. A wide majority of
Republican voters said that government agencies should continue to share
information about global warming with the public; this view is also
shared by most Democrats. This solid bipartisan agreement is striking.

[NOAA's Climate.gov website was the agency's primary climate portal for
the public]{.underline}. The site published climate updates, data, maps,
explainers, and educational products designed for teachers. In late May,
the staff that produced this content [was terminated]{.underline},
according to the Guardian, and the website was taken offline as of June
24, 2025.

Only 28% of U.S. residents regularly hear about climate change in the
media, but 77% want that news. We can change that, and our only
limitation is the size of our budget. Unlike some outlets, we don't have
fossil-fuel backers. And we're not funded directly by Yale University.
Will you chip in to put more climate news in front of Americans in 2025?

In another example, the [Trump administration halted work on the
upcoming National Climate Assessment and dismissed the report's authors,
even though the **report is required by Congress**]{.underline}. As of
July 1, 2025, the website that hosts National Climate Assessment reports
was offline. (You can read an archived version of the most recent report

premier U.S. climate agency" Science 4/11
https://www.science.org/content/article/trump-seeks-end-climate-research-premier-u-s-climate-agency

President Donald [Trump's administration is seeking to end nearly all of
the climate researc]{.underline}h [conducted by]{.underline} the U.S.
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency ([NOAA]{.underline}), one of the
country's premier climate science agencies, according to an internal
budget document seen by Science. [The document indicates the White House
is ready to ask Congress to eliminate NOAA's]{.underline} climate
research centers and cut hundreds of federal and academic climate
scientists who track and study human-driven global warming.

The administration is also preparing to ask for deep cuts to NASA's
science programs, according to media reports today.

The proposed [NOAA cuts]{.underline}---which could be altered before the
administration sends its 2026 budget request to Congress in the coming
weeks---would [cut]{.underline} funding for the [agency's research
arm]{.underline}, the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research
([OAR]{.underline}), to just over \$171 million, **[a drop of \$485
million.]{.underline}** Any remaining research funding from previously
authorized budgets would be moved to other programs. "At this funding
level, OAR is eliminated as a line office," the document states.

If approved by Congress, the [plan would represent a huge blow to
efforts to understand climate change]{.underline}, says Craig McLean,
OAR's longtime director who retired in 2022. "It wouldn't just gut it.
It **[would shut it down]{.underline}**." Scientifically, he adds,
[obliterating OAR would send the United States back to the
1950s]{.underline}---all because the Trump administration doesn't like
the answers to scientific questions NOAA has been studying for a
half-century, according to McLean.

The administration's plan would "[eliminate all funding for
climate]{.underline}, weather, and ocean laboratories and cooperative
[institutes]{.underline}," says the document, which reflects discussions
between NOAA and the White House Office of Management and Budget
([OMB]{.underline}) about the agency's 2026 budget request. Currently,
NOAA operates 10 research labs around the country. [They
include]{.underline} influential ocean research centers in Florida and
Washington state; five [atmospheric science labs]{.underline} in
Boulder, Colorado, and Maryland; and a severe storm lab in Oklahoma. It
also operates the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in New Jersey,
the birthplace of [weather and climate modeling]{.underline}, as well as
a lab in Michigan devoted to the Great Lakes. The agency further funds
[cooperative institutes, which support a large collection of academic
scientists who work closely with the NOAA labs]{.underline}.

The [proposal would cut NOAA's competitive climate research grants
program]{.underline}, which awards roughly \$70 million a year to
academic scientists. It would end support for collecting regional
climate data and information, often used by farmers and other
industries. And it would terminate the agency's National Oceanographic
Partnership Program and college and aquaculture sea grant programs,
which support a host of research efforts.

NOAA officials [still have time to persuade OMB to alter the
request]{.underline}, but NOAA [sources said it is unlikely to
substantially change]{.underline}. But this proposal is only the first
stage of the budget process; Congress will have the final word in
setting NOAA's spending.

It will certainly face strong opposition from Democrats. "Trump's budget
plan for NOAA is both outrageous and dangerous," said Representative Zoe
Lofgren (D--CA), the ranking member of the U.S. House of
Representatives's science committee, in a statement to Science. "This
administration's hostility towards research and rejection of climate
science will have the consequence of eviscerating the weather
forecasting capabilities that this plan claims to preserve."

At NASA, [science programs also face severe cuts]{.underline}, according
to details first reported by Ars Technica. The White House is
considering requesting a [nearly 50% cut to NASA science's
office]{.underline}, down to an overall budget of \$3.9 billion.
According to Ars Technica, the plan calls for: "[a two-thirds cut to
astrophysics, down to \$487 million; a greater than two-thirds cut to
heliophysics]{.underline}, down to \$455 million; a greater than 50
percent cut to Earth science, down to \$1.033 billion; and a 30 percent
cut to Planetary science, down to \$1.929 billion."

Such NASA cuts would [require ending the operations of a huge host of
earth science satellites]{.underline}. They could also result in the
closure of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, which has
thousands of employees and is one of the agency's premier centers for
earth science research. The cuts would also end plans for Mars Sample
Return, the DAVINCI mission to Venus, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space
Telescope, which is almost fully assembled.

At NOAA, the [agency's budget would be cut by \$1.7
billion]{.underline}, the OMB memo said. The proposal also seeks to cut
the National Ocean Service in half, with "no funding for Integrated
Ocean Observing System Regional Observations, Competitive Research,
Coastal Zone Management Grants, National Coastal Resilience Fund, or the
National Estuarine Research Reserve System." The requests would also
close the National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science.

[Other NOAA divisions would also be hit]{.underline}. [OMB]{.underline}
is seeking [to radically rework]{.underline} the next-generation
[geostationary weather satellites planned by the agency's]{.underline}
National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service
(NESDIS). That [includes cutting its planned atmospheric pollution and
ocean color instruments because]{.underline}, as the document puts it,
the satellites will deliver exclusively "weather" data. It could also
cut the infrared sounder, which tracks changes in the vertical
distribution of temperature and moistures, catching storms before they
form, and a lightning mapper.

The request would also [cut funding for the National Center for
Environmental Information]{.underline}---the nation's [primary archive
of climate data---by \$18 million]{.underline}. And it trims mission
support for NOAA's satellites and data systems by \$141 million, among
many other proposals.

**He's already cut funding and laid off hundreds.**

## AT: Governance

### Geoengineering Regulated Now

#### Geoengineering's regulated \-\-- the aff just reinforces disrespect for those regulations.

Mary **Church** 3-5-20**25**, Mary Church is the Geoengineering Campaign
Manager at the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL).
"Geoengineering Governance: Restrictive Framework Must Be Upheld and
Strengthened" https://www.ciel.org/govern-geoengineering/ //MDC

[[Geoengineering]{.mark} --- the large-scale manipulation of Earth's
climate --- [is often framed as an unregulated new frontier, where a
lack of rules leaves the door open to dangerous experimentation.]{.mark}
But [this is simply **not true**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Across
international law, human rights frameworks, and United Nations
environmental agreements, [a strong foundation for
[geoengineering]{.mark} [governance already exists --- and]{.mark} it
[is **highly restrictive**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The [real [issue is]{.mark} not the absence of governance but [the
growing disregard for the restrictive framework that already
exists]{.mark}. In recent years, geoengineering proponents have
attempted to push forward research and field experiments despite clear
international decisions that prohibit or severely limit its
development]{.underline}. Even worse, the voluntary carbon markets and
decisions at the 2024 UN Climate Conference (COP29) risk creating a
backdoor for geoengineering commercialization, undermining climate
action while benefiting polluters.

[Existing [restrictive governance that **prevents geoengineering
development**]{.mark} and deployment [must be upheld and
enforced]{.mark} in the immediate term]{.underline}. Looking forward,
this precautionary framework must be the basis for developing any
additional agreements and rules and ultimately build up to a global ban
or nonuse agreement.

\[image omitted\]

Existing International Agreements Already Restrict Geoengineering

'The CBD reaffirmed its longstanding moratorium in 2024

[One of the [most robust restrictions]{.mark} on geoengineering [comes
from]{.mark} the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity
([**CBD**). Recognizing]{.mark} the [grave and]{.mark} potentially
[irreversible harm geoengineering could cause]{.mark} to biodiversity,
[the CBD]{.mark} had the foresight to [address geoengineering as early
as 2008 with]{.mark} a decision that put in place an effective
[moratorium]{.mark} on ocean fertilization and was quickly followed by a
wider decision for a de facto moratorium on all geoengineering in
2010.]{.underline}

The decision is clear: [[no geoengineering]{.mark} activities [should be
allowed]{.mark} unless there is robust scientific justification and
appropriate consideration of the environmental risks and broader social
impacts]{.underline}. Countries have repeatedly reaffirmed the
moratorium. In 2016, the CBD first reaffirmed its longstanding
moratorium and again in 2024 at the 16th Conference of the Parties
(COP16) to the CBD due to concerns over the proliferation of outdoor
experiments --- particularly in the marine environment. Furthermore,
over 100 organizations supported a statement calling on States to
prevent such geoengineering experiments.

The only exception under the CBD moratorium is for small-scale
scientific research studies conducted in a controlled setting, but even
this is heavily caveated and requires that research be:

Fully justified by the need to gather specific scientific data

Subject to environmental impact assessment

Not cause transboundary harm

Furthermore, [the [decision]{.mark} imposing the moratorium stresses
that it [is]{.mark} "in line and [consistent with]{.mark}" the earlier
[decision on ocean fertilization]{.mark}, which explicitly rules out any
commercial purpose, such as carbon offsetting in such research
studies.]{.underline}

[[It is doubtful]{.mark} that [any]{.mark} of the outdoor field
[experiments]{.mark} proposed or executed in recent years [meet the
required threshold]{.mark}]{.underline}. At COP16, countries explicitly
cited concern at the increase in outdoor field experiments in
negotiations.

The London Convention/London Protocol Also Restricts Marine
Geoengineering

Emerging in parallel to the CBD moratorium is a restrictive regime for
marine geoengineering at the London Convention/London Protocol (LC/LP),
which regulates pollution and dumping at sea. In 2008, the LC/PC
effectively prohibited the deployment of ocean fertilization, and in
2013, it amended the Protocol to allow for the regulation of marine
geoengineering.

Countries under the LC/PC have further indicated their intention to
include four additional categories of marine geoengineering that should
be restricted due to their potential for widespread harm:

Biomass cultivation and dumping

Ocean alkalinity enhancement

Marine cloud brightening

Microbubbles

In 2023, governments stated that activities "other than legitimate
scientific research should be deferred," as these techniques had "the
potential for deleterious effects that are widespread, long-lasting or
severe" and "there is considerable uncertainty regarding their effects
on the marine environment, human health, and on other uses of the
ocean."

While the Protocol and its amendment have yet to enter into force,
decisions of the LC/LP have been approved by resolution and clearly
ought to be implemented by countries. [Like the CBD, the [LC/LP also has
an exemption]{.mark} for what it refers to as "legitimate scientific
research" and has adopted pre-screening criteria for experiments.
Importantly, this exception excludes any projects with a commercial
aspect --- a critical safeguard that should prevent marine
geoengineering from being used for carbon credit schemes.]{.underline}

Geoengineering Contravenes Wider International Law and Human Rights
Obligations

The Precautionary Principle and the Obligation to Prevent Harm

Both the CBD and the LC/LP decisions are based on the precautionary
principle enshrined in the UN Rio Declaration. The precautionary
principle states that where there is scientific uncertainty, actions
that could cause severe or irreversible harm should not be taken. This
approach is highly applicable in the context of geoengineering
technologies because they are unprecedented., [[These technologies can
never be]{.mark} fully [tested other than]{.mark} via
[large-scale]{.mark} deployment --- [with]{.mark} the many [**novel
risks** this would generate]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The obligation not to cause transboundary harm is highly relevant in
relation to geoengineering and, again, is referenced in related
decisions of the CBD]{.underline}. This is particularly true in relation
to solar and marine approaches --- since the oceans and atmosphere know
no political borders --- and because of the scale at which these
technologies would have to be implemented to achieve their intended
impact on the climate. For example, around 10 percent of the ocean's
surface would be required for various marine geoengineering
interventions to theoretically have any meaningful climate impact, while
stratospheric aerosol injection proposes massive-scale pollution of the
atmosphere over hundreds of years. Furthermore, modeling shows that
techniques such as marine cloud brightening and stratospheric aerosol
injection would cause harmful impacts that far surpass mere
intervention, for example, interfering with monsoons. Moreover, such
technologies raise concerns about the challenges of determining
attribution. This is particularly relevant in the context of loss and
damage: how do we determine the contribution of climate change as
opposed to any potential future deployment of solar geoengineering to a
specific extreme weather event?

UNCLOS and ITLOS Advisory Opinion

[Under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea ([**UNCLOS**),
governments have an obligation not to pollute]{.mark} the marine
environment. In 2024, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea
(ITLOS) issued an Advisory Opinion emphasizing that [marine
geoengineering could violate]{.mark} UNCLOS if it introduces pollutants
to the marine environment, as well as if it has the effect of converting
one form of pollution into another]{.underline}. Indeed, proposals to
dump biomass, minerals, and chemicals into the oceans and sequester or
store carbon dioxide in the marine environment clearly have the
potential to do precisely that.

Human Rights Law Exposes Geoengineering's Global Risks

In highlighting "the urgency to implement actions aligned with the best
available science, respecting the human right to a healthy environment
and other human rights," last year, the UN Special Rapporteur on the
human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment identified
geoengineering as "worsening the situation, threatening climate safety
and thus a healthy environment."

Geoengineering runs counter to a wide range of human rights obligations,
including:

The right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment

The right to life, food, water, and health

Indigenous Peoples' right to Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC)

The rights of future generations

A 2023 Human Rights Council Advisory Committee report warned that
"[because \[[geoengineering]{.mark} approaches\] are meant to be applied
on a global scale, they [have the potential to affect everyone]{.mark}
indiscriminately," [which could]{.mark} adversely [impact the human
rights of]{.mark} "millions or perhaps [billions]{.mark} of
people."]{.underline}

The report also highlighted that Indigenous Peoples, peasants, rural
communities, and people on the front lines of the climate crisis were
most at risk and that "potential deployment ... would have a massive and
disproportionate impact on Indigenous Peoples whose traditional lands
and territories are particularly exposed and at risk of experimental
uses."

This points to the importance of upholding the principle of Free, Prior,
and Informed Consent of Indigenous Peoples, while broader rights of
access to information and participation in decision-making are also
worth noting, as is the implausibility of ever fully implementing these
in relation to geoengineering given its nature and scale.

Meanwhile, the Maastricht Principles on the Rights of Future
Generations, a comprehensive framework for understanding how
international law applies to the human rights of future generations,
highlights geoengineering as one of a number of areas that "pose\[s\] a
reasonably foreseeable and substantial risk to the human rights of
future generations."

The Dangerous Proliferation of Geoengineering Experiments

Taken together, [[international agreements]{.mark}, international
[customary law, and human rights law create a broad range of principles,
norms, and obligations]{.mark} squarely [applicable to geoengineering,
all of which are restrictive and precautionary]{.mark}.]{.underline}

However, in practice, [what [we are seeing]{.mark} is [a
**proliferation** of outdoor experiments]{.mark} --- open-air and
open-water --- that are planned or underway]{.underline}. An analysis of
data aggregated by the Heinrich Böll Foundation and ETC Group and
presented through the Geoengineering Monitor Map shows that:

At least 598 outdoor geoengineering experiment trials have been proposed
since 1971.

Over 90 percent were proposed between 2004 and 2023, and more than half
were proposed between 2019 and 2023.

Between 2019 and 2023, proposed marine carbon dioxide removal field
experiments quadrupled --- compared to the period from 2014 to 2018 ---
and solar geoengineering experiments tripled.

[A key risk of small-scale outdoor experiments is that [they]{.mark}
tend to [lead to technology development and]{.mark} potentially [a
**slippery slope** to deployment]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Carbon Markets an Open Door for Risky Geoengineering Technologies

This acceleration, particularly of marine carbon dioxide removal
experiments, is largely driven by voluntary carbon markets and the false
promise of carbon offsets, with many projects pre-selling carbon credits
despite a lack of evidence that such techniques are effective in the
long-term removal and storage of carbon dioxide.

At COP29, under questionable circumstances, rules for a decade-long
contested carbon market mechanism were approved that could permit the
trading of greenhouse gas removals and risks further fuelling the growth
of commercial geoengineering schemes.

However, both the CBD and the LC/LP clearly rule out projects with a
commercial element or those that sell carbon credits, and Member States
to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change must interpret their
obligations under that regime in alignment with their obligations under
other treaties, as well as the wider principles, norms, and obligations
of international law. This means that credits generated through
geoengineering experiments should not be allowed to be traded under the
climate regime.

Conclusion

The multiple inconsistencies and contradictions within the NASEM report
appear to follow a pattern in which risks and dangers of conducting
research are clearly acknowledged, but then the report's actual
recommendations disregard those very same dangers. These contradictions
raise serious questions about how the committee reached consensus on
such a contested and controversial set of recommendations. The report's
deliberations were conducted beyond the purview of public forums, and
the NASEM selects its own elite experts in a non-transparent process.
The majority of the committee were U.S. residents and the committee
lacked representation from critics of solar geoengineering. The minimal
representation from the social sciences and humanities is likely to have
contributed to a more narrow, technocratic assessment of the complex
political and social implications of advancing solar geoengineering
research. [This is problematic because [geoengineering governance
is]{.mark} an especially [wicked]{.mark} problem [which demands
engagement with complex]{.mark} social and political [processes in
a]{.mark} deeply unequal [world marked by **power asymmetries**]{.mark}
arising [from]{.mark} structural [racism and]{.mark} the legacies of
[colonialism]{.mark}. We fear that the [limited regional, epistemic, and
political diversity]{.mark} on the committee may have [contributed to
**inadequate consideration**]{.mark} of the social and political
implications of the recommendations.]{.underline}

[By wading into the [nitty-gritty of]{.mark} what a future
[geoengineering research]{.mark} program should focus on, the report
[preempts public deliberations and global discussion]{.mark} of the
design of a solar geoengineering research program]{.underline}. Given
the stature of the national academies as an institution, and the degree
of detail in the recommendations, the report itself constitutes a de
facto form of solar geoengineering governance (Gupta et al.
Citation2020). Yet, it was created in the absence of the very forms of
governance it recommends: international coordination, inclusive
participation, and a precautionary approach to maintain the strict
separation of research from deployment. The NASEM report is itself a
significant unilateral intervention in the global governance of solar
geoengineering. But the report reads as if those involved in the
processes of designing, writing, publishing and releasing this report
are separate from and therefore not accountable to following their own
recommendations. The process and context of this report raise serious
concerns about whose voices are being amplified, about whose
perspectives are being dismissed or minimized, and about the dangerous
politicization of solar geoengineering research. [The NASEM's
recommendation [to establish a new U.S. research program fails to
acknowledge that]{.mark} ultimately [neither scientists nor]{.mark}
those funding [research will have control over deployment]{.mark}; it
will be political and economic power that will determine how, when and
by whom solar geoengineering research will be applied]{.underline}.

Given the deeply contested and controversial nature of unilateral solar
geoengineering development, the recommendations of this report undermine
efforts on the part of the Biden-Harris Administration to establish
global leadership on climate change. [[The US,]{.mark} as the world's
largest historical polluter with a track record of diluting
international climate policy, [should not be advancing]{.mark} solar
[geoengineering]{.mark} research but should instead expand efforts to
invest directly in the transformative changes that are needed to phase
out fossil fuels and commit to multilateral, coordinated efforts to
advance global climate action and climate justice]{.underline}.

6\. Final Remarks

Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, one of the most influential
environmentalist books ever written, serves not only as a manifesto for
an ecological approach to addressing the impact of human activities on
our planet but also as a cautionary tale about the unintended
consequences of new technologies. She focuses on the harmful effects of
pesticides used in agriculture -- technologies that were designed to
enhance productivity but that carry substantial risks to both the
environment and human health. Carson argues that these innovations,
though promising immediate benefits, threaten the delicate balance of
ecosystems. In this context, in the last chapter of her book, she
remarks:

We stand now where two roads diverge. But unlike the roads in Robert
Frost's familiar poem, they are not equally fair. The road we have long
been traveling is deceptively easy, a smooth superhighway on which we
progress with great speed, but at its end lies disaster. The other fork
of the road -- the one "less traveled by" -- offers our last, our only
chance to reach a destination that assures the preservation of the
earth.187

Carson's poignant observation remains as relevant today as it was in
1962. We stand at a crossroads, faced with a choice between the
deceptive ease of technological solutions and the more challenging path
of systemic socioeconomic change. [The road of [techno-optimism is
alluring]{.mark} because it promises that we can maintain our current
lifestyles without making substantial sacrifices. [However, this]{.mark}
path [leads to a future where]{.mark} the root causes of [environmental
degradation remain unaddressed]{.mark}, and the consequences of climate
change become increasingly severe]{.underline}. The narrative that
technological advancements alone can solve the climate crisis is a
dangerous one. As highlighted throughout this article, while technology
can mitigate environmental degradation, it is not a panacea. [The
[reliance on technology]{.mark} as a primary solution to climate change
[overlooks]{.mark} the [**systemic issues** inherent in]{.mark} our
socioeconomic structures, particularly the growth-dependent nature of
[capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}.

International law has persisted in prioritising technological
innovation. From early regulatory efforts to contemporary sources, there
is a clear emphasis on technology transfer, investment and development.
While these measures are essential, they must be complemented by strong
regulatory frameworks, changes to consumption and production patterns
and a structural transformation of our economic systems. In this
respect, this article does not oppose technological innovation; instead,
it critiques the reliance on technology alone to solve the climate
crisis. A modest form of techno-optimism, guided by a post growth
approach and an ecological narrative may indeed be acceptable.188
[Unfortunately, the [mainstream eco-political]{.mark} [discourse]{.mark}
in international law [often falls]{.mark} into the trap of strong
[techno-optimism]{.mark}, thus [perpetuating]{.mark} the politics of
sustained [unsustainability]{.mark}, where systemic issues are managed
rather than resolved.]{.underline}

I must also acknowledge my own tendency towards an individualistic
perspective. By referring to international law in the third person, I
have removed myself from the equation, failing to recognise that
international law results from the actions of international actors,
including international law academics like me. We are responsible for
changing international law; it will not change on its own -- that will
only occur if we start with ourselves. While the degree of influence
varies, international legal practitioners, educators and researchers are
responsible for critically approaching their own practice. We must
question whether our staunch support of new technologies can solve the
world's problems. If we conclude -- as I have -- that it cannot, we must
ask what steps we need to take to effect meaningful change.

[[We must move beyond]{.mark} a **[narrow]{.mark} focus on
[technological solutions]{.mark}** and embrace a different
strategy]{.underline}. We must evolve the law to prioritise changes in
our socioeconomic system, ensuring a sustainable future for generations
to come. As legal practitioners, educators, and researchers, it is
incumbent upon us to adopt a self-reflective practice.189 We need to be
more critical of technology, wary of its promises, and recognise our
responsibility in shaping legal frameworks that address the structural
complexities of the climate crisis. [By doing so, [we can move beyond
individualistic perspectives and work]{.mark} collectively [toward
systemic changes that]{.mark} genuinely [contribute to solving]{.mark}
these pressing global [issues]{.mark}. The road less travelled, though
challenging, [offers our]{.mark} last and [**only chance** to avoid mass
extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}.

V. Conclusion: Testing the power of social technology in the face of SRM
technology

The above assessment reveals that the [development and deployment of
[SRM would put]{.mark} almost the entire structure of [international
legal obligations]{.mark} pertaining to environmental protection [under
strain, especially]{.mark} the [**harm prevention obligation** under
international customary law]{.mark}]{.underline}. Against this backdrop,
strong arguments can be made for reading this obligation as rendering
SRM deployment unlawful, even in the absence of a specific treaty to
that effect. The extent of legal constraints depends on how States
conceptualise the temporal scope and content of prevention. This paper
argues that [[strong doctrinal arguments can be made against]{.mark} the
[weak conceptualisations]{.mark} of the principle [that would relegate
its role to regulating only]{.mark} the [harmful]{.mark} side effects of
[SRM]{.mark} or would deem it an optional limit that States can modify
or circumvent by a treaty arrangement]{.underline}. Importantly,
stronger configurations of prevention not only arise as a logical
necessity from the positivist reading of relevant rules of international
law, but they also find budding support in the practice of influential
stakeholders. More concretely, the Scientific Advice Mechanism advised
the EU Commission in December 2024 to give effect to an EU wide
moratorium on SRM deployment and large-scale experiments and to work
towards a global governance framework with a position favouring
non-deployment in the foreseeable future.105

The future of SRM technology largely depends on how its social
perception will unfold; and how the risks, uncertainties, and
opportunities of this form of geoengineering are framed against the
background of the escalating effects of the climate crisis. This article
zeroed in on the specific role of international law in shaping this
public discourse. It is argued that [international law, a special type
of social technology, may even be capable of halting the advent of
harmful physical technologies]{.underline}. It depends on whether
international lawyers conceive the harm prevention obligation as one
that tolerates further technological research and development despite
their foreseeable harmful effects, or rather, they amplify a reading of
this obligation that has a binding, justiciable and future oriented
character, which can be breached even before respective harm occurs.

[This paper showed how the unique temporality of emerging
[geoengineering]{.mark} technologies, such as SRM, **[puts the normative
"teeth" and strength of the prevention principle to the
test]{.mark}**]{.underline}. SRM technologies do not yet exist in the
real world only in the shared imagination of experts, policy advisors,
and political stakeholders. So are the inevitable risks and potential
impacts triggered by SRM, which currently manifest themselves in model
calculations and projections. [[The international community is]{.mark}
currently [at a critical juncture]{.mark} with respect to our
technological future. The extent to which SRM technologies and the
accompanying harmful risks and impacts-- will materialise largely
depends on whether international law is capable of establishing some
bottom lines for technological innovation by giving effect to the duty
of prevention]{.underline}. This, in turn, depends on what international
lawyers think and project towards the wider public about the temporality
and normative implications of the harm prevention obligation under
customary international law.

B. The Modern World

[Today\'s [international legal structure is]{.mark}]{.underline} **[far
more [complicated]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Certain customary rules still
serve as background defaults governing many areas of state interaction,
and the majority of new treaties are still bilateral. But two factors
- [the rise of]{.underline} [[**multilateral treaties**
and]{.mark} swiftly developing [customary international law
- have changed the dynamic]{.mark} between treaty and customary
international law, resulting in treaties sometimes being the fixed
backdrop against which new state practice and norms
develop.]{.underline}

1\. Constitutive Treaties

The past century has seen a dramatic rise in multilateral treaties -
treaties \[\*244\] concluded by multiple countries that often aspire to
universal participation. As early as the 1920s, scholars were
recognizing that there were \"an increasing number of multilateral
treaties.\" According to one study, eighty-six multilateral treaties
were concluded in the century between 1648 through 1748 - but more than
two thousand such treaties were concluded in the twenty-five years
between 1951 and 1975! This [proliferation might be traced to
a]{.underline} **[growing conviction]{.underline}** [that
certain]{.underline} **[[global problems]{.underline}]{.mark}** [-
including [combating]{.mark} the training and financing
of]{.underline} [**transnational [terrorist organizations]{.mark}**,
[minimizing]{.mark} human-driven]{.underline} [[**climate change**,]{.underline} [and reducing]{.underline}]{.mark}[ the
development or use of [**weapons of mass destruction**-are best
addressed through global solutions]{.mark}.]{.underline}

5\. Conclusion

[In addition to its physical and environmental risks, which are
predicted to be significant, [SSI is **legally
hazardous**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although omnilateral SSI is legal,
there is a very low probability that it will occur. [There are many
descriptively politically legitimate states in the world. [As long as
one]{.mark} of them [does not have]{.mark} equal, effective, and
democratic [control over]{.mark} the management of the [technology, SSI
is unilateral]{.mark}. This [involves]{.mark} the [transfer of an
existential function]{.mark} -- the ecological function -- from a
descriptively politically legitimate state to a foreign state; due to
the termination effect, path dependency, and socio-technical lock-in,
this transfer is irrevocable on any meaningful timescale]{.underline}.
Hence, unilateral SSI constitutes perfect capture. Because [perfect
capture [violates]{.mark} the inherent right of [**self-defence**, it
breaches jus cogens]{.mark}, a very serious act that must be prevented
even at a high cost]{.underline}. 118

In this epilogue, I have explored the practical implications of the
finding that unilateral SSI breaches jus cogens, asking whether states
should conclude a multilateral treaty to prohibit SSI research. The
answer to this question, as we have seen, depends on four factors: (a)
the probability that such research will achieve omnilateral SSI, (b) the
probability that it will achieve unilateral SSI, (c) the benefits of
omnilateral SSI, and (d) the costs of unilateral SSI. The literature on
the ethics and governance of SSI research shows that proponents and
opponents of such research agree that, if this technology is used, it
will almost certainly be used for unilateral SSI rather than omnilateral
SSI. [Moreover, there is good reason to believe that, [if]{.mark}
[research]{.mark} were to [yield]{.mark} valuable [information
about]{.mark} the effects of [SSI, such **research would be unilateral**
and]{.mark} would itself [amount to full-scale, unilateral
deployment]{.mark}]{.underline}. I conclude that, because: (a) [there is
a very low probability that SSI research will achieve omnilateral SSI,
(b) there is a very high probability that such research will achieve
unilateral SSI, (c) the benefits of omnilateral SSI are low (because
unknown), and (d) the costs of unilateral SSI are very
high]{.underline}, states should conclude a multilateral treaty to
prohibit SSI research.
