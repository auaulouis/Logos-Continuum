**Philosophy**

Feminist International Relations (Fem IR) challenges traditional IR
theories, like realism and liberalism, for relying on masculinized
assumptions about power, security, and the state. Instead of viewing
states as unitary, rational actors competing for survival, Fem IR
emphasizes relationality, context, and the lived experiences of
marginalized groups, particularly women.

In Feminist IR, masculine and feminine refer to culturally assigned
traits, not biological sex. These categories are:

**Masculine** - Often associated with rationality, autonomy, aggression,
strength, dominance, and independence. These traits are valorized in
traditional IR theories like realism (e.g., the rational state, the
warrior hero).

**Feminine** - Linked to emotion, vulnerability, cooperation, nurturing,
interdependence, and care. These traits are often devalued or excluded
from mainstream IR.

Feminist theorists argue that IR privileges masculinized ways of knowing
and acting, while feminized perspectives, especially those centered on
care, empathy, and lived experience, are ignored or dismissed. This
gendered valuation reinforces hierarchies and limits our understanding
of global politics.

Key feminist scholars (e.g., Laura Sjoberg, J. Ann Tickner, Fiona
Robinson) argue that gender is not peripheral to global politics, it is
foundational. Patriarchy shapes not only how states interact, but also
how we define concepts like security, rationality, and sovereignty. Fem
IR calls for a care-based, human-centric, and contextually aware
approach to foreign policy that addresses structural violence,
ecological destruction, and gendered power hierarchies.

**Vocabulary Cheat Sheet**

**Hegemonic Masculinity** - A culturally dominant form of masculinity
that subordinates women and other masculinities; projected onto state
behavior in IR.

**Relationality** - The view that identities and ethics emerge from
relationships, not autonomy. Contrasts with rational, individualist
models.

**Structural Violence** - Systemic harm caused by social structures
(e.g., poverty, sexism, racism) rather than direct physical violence.

**Power-With** - A feminist alternative to "power-over," emphasizing
cooperation, collective action, and mutual empowerment.

**Unitary Actor Assumption** - The idea that states act with a single
coherent interest; Fem IR rejects this as masking internal inequality.

**Care Ethics** - A moral framework emphasizing empathy, context, and
response to others\' needs---central to feminist foreign policy.

**Epistemic Violence** - The harm caused by privileging certain (often
Western, male) ways of knowing while silencing others.

**Ecofeminism** - Links the domination of nature with the subjugation of
women, critiquing patriarchal dualisms like man/nature.

**Revisability -** The feminist idea that knowledge and moral principles
must be flexible, context-sensitive, and open to revision.

**Masculinized Security** - A model of security rooted in domination,
militarism, and control---contrasted with human or environmental
security.

**Justification Analysis** - A method for analyzing how actors justify
their actions, revealing the gendered moral frameworks behind policy
claims.

**Standpoint Epistemology -** A theory of knowledge that argues all
understanding is socially situated and shaped by one\'s experiences,
especially those of marginalized groups. Feminist scholars use
standpoint epistemology to argue that people at the margins of power
(e.g., women, racial minorities, colonized peoples) can produce more
complete or critical knowledge about social structures than dominant
perspectives allow. It rejects the idea of "objective,"
view-from-nowhere science and instead emphasizes contextual, embodied,
and political knowledge**.**

In Fem IR, this means the perspectives of those most affected by war,
displacement, and inequality---often women---should be central to
theorizing global politics.

Toward a Feminist Theory of War". Columbia University Press. //

Some dyadic accounts of war are interested in how states' interactions
lead to (or help prevent) conflict between them in the sense of
signaling, rather than in the sense of relating.
["**[Steps-to-war]{.mark}" [models ]{.mark}**[lay out]{.mark} "a set of
closely [related paths to war that involve]{.mark} a series of [steps
between states that]{.mark} [are]{.mark} roughly [equal in
power]{.mark}."]{.underline}50 As Levy and Thompson explain, "they show
each 'step' increases the probability of war, and that the process is
cumulative."51 [Relatedly, rivalry theories of war see specific
interstate relationships as more likely to lead to war than others. They
suggest that because states "focus selectively on the states that appear
to represent the greatest threat,"]{.underline} the act of singling out
antagonists is key in predicting interstate wars, suggesting that
"repetitive war behavior" points to conflict probability.[52 [In this
view, states' interactions are]{.mark} cumulative in [causing conflict
and war]{.mark}(s), [and]{.mark} some [states' rivalries account
for]{.mark} the majority of [wars]{.mark}."]{.underline} "Another
theoretical approach to war that takes account of interaction focuses on
bargaining. bargaining theories of war are interested in why war(s)
happen(s) despite the(ir) cost, and therefore focus on why war-fighting
parties were unable (or unwilling) to reach a (cheaper) negotiated
settlement to their dispute(s),53 with emphasis on possible pathologies
in negotiations[, including commitment problems,54 private information
(and/or incentives to misrepresent),55 the lack of a "bargaining" space
of outcomes that are mutually preferred to war,56 and/or indivisible
issues.]{.underline}57 This work implies that it is difficult to reach a
negotiated settlement even when such a deal would be optimal for all
parties involved.58" "[All [three]{.mark} of these [models
assume]{.mark} that [states interact with]{.mark} some **[linear
action]{.mark}** and reaction, [in which "the primary]{.mark} [factors
in determining war and peace are the foreign policy strategies]{.mark}
adopted by states to deal with their disputes."]{.underline}59 All three
models also assume an internal coherence, or unitary nature, of the
actors interacting, whereby each is making decisions for an internally
united whole. The bargaining models add the assumption that the unitary
actors interacting progressively do so rationally and calculate
cost--benefit analysis in conflict decision-making[. **[Feminist
research]{.mark} [has questioned]{.mark} each of these
[assumptions,]{.mark}** [arguing]{.mark} that [states interact more
relationally]{.mark} than reactively; [suggesting]{.mark} that [states
are]{.mark}, rather than [unitary, diverse and full of]{.mark} internal
[conflict]{.mark} that should not be neglected when defining (or
critiquing the idea of) "interest";]{.underline} and that states are not
the rational actors that bargaining theorists assume them to be.60"
"Action and Reaction As I mentioned above, a number of
[**[dyadic]{.mark}-level [theories]{.mark}** of the causes of war either
**[do not theorize how states interact explicitly]{.mark}**,61 or,
[in]{.mark} the case of [bargaining, rivalry, and steps-to-war
models]{.mark}, assume states' interactions are individuated and
progressive.]{.underline} by individuated and progressive[, I mean that
one state acts, the other (or others) respond, and then the first actor
acts again in a sequence of interaction that can be understood
chronologically62 and told as a coherent story.]{.underline} Feminist
theorists' understandings of the incomplete independence of decision
makers and their decisions 63 frequently suggest that this picture needs
to be complicated significantly. For our purposes now, [the idea of
state interaction in these theoretical approaches takes account of (as
discussed in chapter 3) Allen's ideas of power-over (as domination) and
power-to (as resistance of domination)64 but takes inadequate account of
power-with, both directly (as states can act together) and in its
implications for interpreting state interactions (as neither necessarily
individuated or progressive)."]{.underline} "Power-with, or the ability
to act in concert, pooling (symbolic or material) power, resources,
and/or knowledge, suggests that a model of state behavior in which we
understand actions and responses to actions dichotomously does not tell
the whole story. [Discussing methods such as participatory planning,65
multisited [feminist]{.mark} social [criticism]{.mark},66 and
empowerment,67 feminist theorists [have suggested]{.mark} both [that
actors are **interdependent** and]{.mark} that they **[can act
together]{.mark}**, simultaneously, and in role-similar and
role-differentiated ways.]{.underline}68 In this view, instead of seeing
policy as (always) assertion and/or response, it can be seen as
responsiveness, more complicated constitutively (in terms of who the
actor is) and directionally (in terms of where policies are going).69
[For process-based dyadic war theorizing, this suggests that [there may
be different]{.mark}, more empirically nuanced, [ways of looking at the
nature of relationships between states to understand]{.mark}
[how]{.mark} it is that [they end up in conflict]{.mark}, particularly
in terms of their (gendered) war narratives and (gendered) cycles of
violence. before sketching out what that might look like, this section
continues to think about the problems with assumptions of state unity,
state rationality, and the gender neutrality of the "gender neutrality
of the process to war in process-based theories.]{.underline} Unitary
Units Feminist scholars have also interrogated the unitary nature of the
state, pointing out that efforts to maximize the state's security
interests often threaten the security of people inside the state[.
Specifically, as I discussed in the previous section, [the]{.mark}
state's [most **marginalized citizens** are]{.mark} often
**[made]{.mark} [insecure]{.mark}** [by]{.mark} state
[security-seeking]{.mark}, making it clear that a state does not have a
single interest in interstate interaction but many that
conflic]{.underline}t. J. Ann Tickner contends that "an explanation of
the [historical development of state]{.underline} sovereignty and [state
identities]{.underline} as they have evolved over time [does indeed
suggest [deeply **gendered** constructions]{.mark} that [have not
included women]{.mark} on the same terms as men."]{.underline}70 This is
because, according to Tickner:" "From the time of their foundation,
states have sought to control the right to define political identity.
Since their legitimacy has constantly been threatened by the undermining
power of subnational and transnational loyalties, [states' [survival and
success]{.mark} have depended on the creation and maintenance of
legitimating national identities; often these identities [have depended
on the manipulation of gendered representation]{.mark}]{.underline}....
Drawing on metaphors that evoke matrimonial and familial relations, the
nation has been portrayed as both male and female.... [The sense of
community implicit in these family metaphors is deeply [gendered]{.mark}
in [ways]{.mark} that not only [legitimate foreign policy]{.mark}
practices [but also reinforce inequalities]{.mark} between men and
women.71"]{.underline} "Using these gendered metaphors, the state can,
while shoring up its "national interest," both threaten the interest of
marginalized citizens inside it and reinforce power inequalities among
its groups. Catherine MacKinnon has explained that the "[state's
structures and actions are driven by and institutionalize strategy based
on an epistemic angle of vision"]{.underline} that can "distinguish
public from private, naturalize dominance as difference, hide coercion
beyond consent, and conceal politics beyond morality."72 [These
[structures]{.mark} require a certain standard of behavior from some
members of the state,73 while [suppress]{.mark}ing [the voices of
others]{.mark} altogether.]{.underline}74" "With these tools, the state
can appear unitary by suppressing its diversity and presenting one
concept of national interest, autonomous of and not necessarily
representative of its citizens. [In this understanding, [the sovereign
state can be "an]{.mark} [extension of]{.mark} the separation-minded
realist [man]{.mark}, also autonomous to various degrees from the
diverse 'domestic' interests he-it allegedly exists to
protect."]{.underline}75 Additionally, states are complicit with gender
subordination when they fail to intervene in domestic violence,
perpetuate a heterosexist bias in education, exercise discrimination in
welfare policies, and operate on patriarchal laws.76" ["In this
conception, the unitary state is a misleading and malignant
construction. Two implications for the process of state interaction
follow: [states that interact]{.mark} often [promote unrepresentative
interests]{.mark}, and those unrepresentative interests exclude gender,
racial, and cultural minorities.]{.underline} In this sense, states'
[[elites]{.mark} often make wars (or fail to) "representing" a limited
group or groups among their populations, while [claim]{.mark}ing **[full
representativeness]{.mark}, effectively [rendering]{.mark}** a
significant [portion of their]{.mark} supposed "[constituency]{.mark}"
**[invisible]{.mark}** in the process of interacting with other
states.]{.underline} Empirically, this means that there are a number of
levels of interstate interaction, many of which are omitted from
process-based notions of dyadic war theorizing. Normatively, it suggests
that our conceptions of how states interact (and the content of those
interactions) are problematically skewed." "Rationality in Interaction
This skew is particularly evident in the assumption of rationality.77
[The rationality assumption implies that the knower/actor can separate
himself/herself from the "other" in interactions with that
other.]{.underline} Feminists have argued that knowledge is always
perspectival and political; therefore, states and their leaders'
decisions about how to interact with others are not rational, but
informed by their situational and political biases. [In this view, the
rationality assumption may be seen as at once itself a political bias
and obscuring other political biases.]{.underline} As Naomi Scheman
argues, perceived rational cost--benefit analysis about war-making and
war-fighting should "always be seen as especially problematical when...
constructed only by those in positions of privilege... \[which provide\]
only distorted views about the world."78 [In this view, rational
calculation is not an objective, attainable, and desirable end, but a
partial representation of both interest and actors' representation of
those interests.]{.underline} In this way, through gender lenses,
rationality has been seen as importantly incomplete, leaving out
significant (if not the most significant) factors that go into
decision-making.79" "In addition to understanding the rationality
assumption as partial (and therefore unrepresentative), feminist
research has pointed out links between rationality and masculinism.80 As
Karen Jones notes, advocates of rationality as a guide for interstate
interactions81 assume: 1. Available... conceptions of rationality and
reason represent genuinely human norms and ideals; 2. The list of norms
and ideals contained within available conceptions of rationality and
reason are sufficiently complete; and 3. The external normative
functions assigned to reason and rationality are unproblematic.82"
"Looking through gender lenses shows problems with each of these
assumptions. [[Feminists]{.mark} have [argued]{.mark} that "[the
identity of the]{.mark} [modern subject]{.mark}---in models of human
nature, citizenship, the rational actor, the knowing subject, economic
man, and political agency---[is]{.mark} not gender-neutral but
[masculine]{.mark} (and typically European and
heterosexual).]{.underline}"83 This impacts not only how we see the
rational subject, but how we predict and understand his decisions, at
the state level as well as at the individual level. According to
Margaret Atherton, the possibility of rationality has "been used in a
disturbing fashion to mark a gender distinction. We have, for example,
on the one hand, the man of reason, and, on the other, the woman of
passion."84 In rationality assumptions, [[traits associated with
masculinity are normalized]{.mark} and [traits]{.mark} [associated with
femininity are excluded]{.mark}.]{.underline} The impact is compounded
because (masculinized) rationality and its (feminized) alternatives are
not on equal playing fields. As a result, Karen Jones notes that
["women's assumed deficiency in rationality" has been used to exclude
both women and knowledge associated with femininity from accepted views
of the world.]{.underline}85 The alleged gender neutrality of
rationality, then, "is often a covert form of privileging maleness "and
omission of "what has traditionally counted as 'feminine.'"87 Still,
[adding women and values associated with femininity to current concepts
of rationality is unlikely to create a gender-neutral concept of
rationality.]{.underline}88 This is because, epistemologically, the
sovereign rational subject constructs artificial gendered boundaries
between rationality and emotion, male and female, and knower and
known.89 [Among states, [those boundaries]{.mark} are not benign.
Instead, they [breed competition]{.mark} and domination [that]{.mark}
inspire and [foster war(s]{.mark}) and conflict(s).]{.underline}90 This
competition frequently relies on contrasting the state's own masculinity
to the enemy's (actual or perceived) femininity. [This cycle of
[gendering]{.mark}s [is]{.mark} not [a]{.mark} series of events but a
[social continuum]{.mark}. In these gendered relationships, as Zillah
Eisenstein argues, ["gender differentiation will be mobilized for war
and peace]{.mark}," especially moving forward into the age of an
American empire focused on manliness.91]{.underline} Feminists have long
argued that [competitions between hegemonic masculinities and
subordinate masculinities play a role in causing war(s).92]{.underline}"
"Hidden beneath the assumed independence, rationality, and unity of
state interaction leading to war are gendered interstate interactions
that cause, constitute, and relate to war and wars. [Feminist scholars
have recognized the extent to which the preeminence of **[masculine
values]{.mark} [dominate]{.mark}s** (particularly conflictual) accounts
of [interstate interactions]{.mark}, wherein "rational" interactions
often become "a self-reproducing discourse of fear, suspicion,
anticipated violence, and violence" [in which "force is used to
checkmate force]{.mark}.]{.underline}"93 Interstate interactions leading
to wars often show the gendered nature of war narratives, war logics,
and war languages, which produce (and reproduce) gendered cycles of
violence."

#### Arctic Threat construction is Masculinized International Theory, that glamorizes the warrior and demonizes the enemy -- this form of securitization creates dualisms between Us and them, and humans and the environment, resulting in Patriarchal destruction

The state and hegemonic masculinity Feminism as an academic discipline
grew out of the feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s, but feminist
perspectives first entered the international relations discipline at the
end of the 1980s, about the same time as the end of the Cold War. A
landmark book in feminist writings in international relations is Ann
Tickner´s book Gender in International Relations published in 1992.
Tickner points out that because foreign and military [policy-making has
largely been conducted by men]{.underline}, it should not be surprising
that the discipline that analyses these activities is [primarily about
men and masculinity]{.underline}. "We seldom realize we think in these
terms," she writes, "...however; in most fields of knowledge [we have
become accustomed to equating what is **human** with what is
**masculine**]{.underline}," (Tickner 1992, p. 5). Tickner traces how in
realism, the most dominant school of thought within international
relations, the ideal of the [[glorified **male warrior**]{.mark} has
been [projected onto the behavior of **states**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Throughout history, [[characteristics associated with
**masculinity**]{.mark}, such as toughness, courage, power,
independence, and even physical strength, [have been]{.mark} those [most
**valued** in **international politics**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
glorification of male warrior attributes celebrates only one type of
masculinity, however, subordinating other types of masculinities.
Connell has used the term ["hegemonic masculinity" to explain how one
type of masculinity can occupy the hegemonic position in a pattern of
gender relations]{.underline}. She defines hegemonic masculinity as:
["... the configuration of gender practice which embodies the currently
accepted answer to the problem of the legitimacy of patriarchy, which
guarantees (or is taken to guarantee) the dominant position of men and
the subordination of women,"]{.underline} (Connell 1995, p. 77).
Hegemonic masculinity is sustained through its opposition to various
less valued masculinities (e.g. homosexuality), and through its
relations to various devalued feminine qualities, creating unequal power
relationships between different groups of men, and between men and
women. Tickner claims that in international politics, the
characteristics associated with [**[hegemonic masculinity]{.mark}** are
[projected onto]{.mark} the [behavior of states]{.mark} whose
**[success]{.mark}** as international actors is [**measured** in terms
of]{.mark} their **[power]{.mark}** capabilities [and]{.mark} capacity
for **self-help** and **[autonomy]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Tickner 1992).
Liberalism, the main competing theory of international relations to
realism, is not free from masculine values underpinning basic
assumptions, according to Tickner. While realists emphasize competition
and power struggles, liberals are advocates of free trade and
cooperation between states that will maximize benefits. According to
liberals, human beings are driven by rational self interest. "The
rational economic man" is offered in contrast to "the political man".
But perhaps the difference is not so great? The rational economic man
has many similarities to the political man, but his aggressive passions
have been tamed by the rational pursuit of profit (Tickner 1992). Women
are still absent from the picture and feminine values related to caring,
nurture and service, all of which are crucial for reproduction and the
survival of the younger generation, are nowhere to be found. After
drawing up the picture of international politics as a masculine domain,
Tickner asks: "How could feminist perspectives contribute anything new
to its academic discourses?" (1992, p. 17). She argues that by
privileging masculine values over feminine, the options available to
states and their policy-makers to tackle the global challenges of the
present are seriously constrained. Since [[knowledge about the behavior
of states]{.underline}]{.mark} and the international systems
[[depends]{.underline}]{.mark} almost entirely [[on
assumptions]{.underline}]{.mark} that are [[derived from men]{.mark}´s
experiences]{.underline}, a large part of human experience is ignored,
[[limiting our ability to come up with]{.mark} innovative and
transformative [solutions]{.mark}]{.underline} to problems. Competition
or cooperation? To evaluate if climate change is a security threat in
the Arctic, one must be clear on what is meant by security. Are the main
concerns with potential conflicts between states or should we be more
concerned with human security challenges at the local level? The focus
of attention is important, because it not only influences how policy is
shaped but it directs what types of policy measures are implemented.
Already, it has been established by scientific research that the Arctic
is extremely vulnerable to observed and projected climate change and
climate changes are being experienced particularly intensely in the
region. For example, in the past few decades, Arctic average temperature
has risen at almost twice the rate of the rest of the world (Arctic
Council 2004). The warming of the Arctic is causing thawing of the
permafrost soils of the tundra, melting of glaciers and increasing
erosion of the coasts by wave action and storms. These changes are
impacting the natural environment, but the effects on human communities
are also considerable. These [effects can be viewed both as threats and
opportunities]{.underline}. For example, the melting of ice can make
extraction of resources easier and new shipping routes more viable.
These new opportunities could, however, turn out to be potential sources
of conflict, and thus pose a threat to security in the region (German
Advisory Council 2008). In an article published in Foreign Affairs,
Borgerson (2008) argues that [global climate change has given birth to a
new scramble for territory and resources among Arctic
powers]{.underline}**. He warns that while other Arctic powers (Russia,
Norway, Denmark and Canada) are in a race to claim additional territory
in the region, the US is remaining on the sidelines. Borgerson is
concerned that without US leadership to help develop diplomatic
solutions to competing claims and potential conflicts, the region could
erupt in an armed conflict, asstates compete for newly accessible
resources. "Although the melting Arctic holds great promise, it also
poses grave dangers. The combination of new shipping routes, trillions
of dollars in possible oil and gas resources, and a poorly defined
picture of state ownership makes for a toxic brew," he says (Borgerson
2008, p. 73). Borgerson is approaching the topic from the traditional**
[realist perspective]{.underline}, claiming that climate change is
creating [new **threats** to US **national security**]{.underline}, [due
to the competing territorial claims of Arctic states]{.underline} in
order to gain access to and control over new shipping routes, energy
resources, fishing grounds and other potential assets. [[Although he
calls upon the US gov]{.mark}ernment [to]{.mark} provide leadership in
[negotiat]{.mark}ing [diplomatic solutions]{.mark}]{.underline}, rather
than using their military power, [he [clearly expects]{.mark} that if
left alone, the other [states will use the threat of military force to
sort out]{.mark} their [competing claims.]{.mark} The fear that the
melting of the Arctic ice will lead to a competitive "scramble for
resources**"**]{.underline} has been echoed in numerous media accounts
in recent years. However, other authors and commentators point out that
cooperation is a more logical path to follow. For example, in a paper on
the new security agenda in the High North, Bailes (2009) emphasizes the
importance of cooperation of both states and nonstate actors,: "Even at
this early stage in exploring the new northern agenda, it is crystal
clear that the only viable solutions are based on win-win cooperation
and on respect for planned, transparent, at least partly regulated
frameworks of action by state and non-state actors alike," (Bailes 2009,
p. 3). Whether competition or cooperation is the guiding light in
present day interaction among Arctic states is not always obvious. The
rhetoric is clearly one of cooperation. For the past two decades
interregional cooperation has increased and numerous regional
initiatives and forums have been created. The Arctic Council, for
example, was established in 1996 as a high level intergovernmental forum
to provide means for promoting cooperation, coordination and interaction
among the Arctic States, especially in the fields of sustainable
development and environmental protection (Arctic Council n.d.). Heininen
(2010b) argues that at the beginning of the 21st century the Arctic is a
stable and peaceful region with increased cooperation both within the
region and between the region and the outside world. However, he also
warns that this spirit of cooperation will not automatically continue
when new challenges arise. For example, even though climate change is an
environmental issue, [it also has a security dimension related to state
sovereignty and the national security of Arctic states]{.underline}.
Thus, the [issue may appear as a traditional security
issue]{.underline}, calling for [remilitarization of the
region]{.underline}, but this would be a mistake, since climate change
needs a more comprehensive approach to security, one that includes
issues related to both environmental security and human security
(Heininen 2010b). Feminist scholars have also highlighted this risk. For
example, MacGregor warns that the securitization of climate change can
lead to a "masculinization" of environmentalism. If climate change is
securitized it is constructed as a problem that requires the kinds of
solutions that are the traditional domain of men and hegemonic
masculinity. This could mean that [both **[military responses]{.mark}**
and **[exceptional measures]{.mark}** that depend on [**downgrading of
ethical concerns** would be **justified**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(MacGregor 2010). Challenging the traditional, state-centric view of
security thus seems to be an important component of any attempts to
securitize climate change in an effort to channel more resources into
political processes. Rather than focusing on states, the more
[[people-oriented approach]{.mark} of human security seems to be a [more
appropriate framework for analyzing threats]{.mark} posed by climate
change.]{.underline} The [human security approach is particularly
appealing for feminist researchers]{.underline}, who have generally
[sought to emphasize marginal groups and give voice to the
powerless]{.underline}, using gender as an analytical tool. In fact, one
can easily draw a [parallel between the human security agenda and
feminist security theory since the works of feminist
scholars]{.underline} on war; gender and security [have contributed to
the emergence of human security. **Feminist scholars**]{.underline}
writing about security have [focused on the [security of the
**individual**, rather than the **state**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
among other things they have contributed to the understanding of how
[**[structural violence]{.mark}** can [**threaten** the **security** of
**individuals**]{.mark} and groups]{.underline}. The concept
["structural violence", as a term to describe **social
injustice**]{.underline}, was first introduced by peace researcher Johan
Galtung, in his article Violence, Peace and Peace Research. He uses the
concept to explain how [systems created by society can
discriminate]{.underline} (often unintentionally) [against individuals
belonging to certain groups]{.underline} (Galtung 1969). Feminists have
developed [this concept to explain the [exploitation of women]{.mark}
under the patriarchal system]{.underline}, **and pointed at the
various** [[dangers **posed to** certain groups]{.mark} **in society,**
[even if **national security is** not threatened]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Although feminist scholars have been very critical of the traditional
definition of security, their criticism did not reach mainstream
discourse in security studies. The emergence of the human security
agenda, however, changed this. Although the human security concept can
be traced to policy institutions like the UNDP, or individual
governments like Canada and Norway, Thórarinsdóttir (2009) points at
three ways in which feminism influenced the human security agenda.
First, the writings of feminist scholars on security issues helped to
create fertile soil for the new concept. Second, women activist
organizations had prepared the ground, by drawing attention to gender
based violence in conflicts, and third, it can be argued that the
increasing number of women in position of power, both in national
governments and within international institutions, helped pave the way
for new ideas to emerge and gain acceptance. The broadening of the
security concept, and the increasing emphasis on human security, both
globally and in the Arctic context, point towards a shift, where
feminine values are given greater weight than before in security
discourses. The emergence of new challenges, like climate change, has no
doubt facilitated this shift. Yet, the more [traditional views of
security]{.underline} are still noticeable and might be more [evident in
state actions]{.underline} than rhetoric. For example, despite a
decreased military presence in the Arctic since the Cold War, there is
not any real evidence of disarmament in northern regions. While in some
parts of the Arctic military bases and radar stations have been closed
and troops have been withdrawn and activities stopped, in other parts
military activities have been extended and new areas have been
identified as strategically important (Heininen 2010a). Thus, it is
clear that a certain [tension exists between the need to cooperate and
the tendency to prioritize the protection of one's own
interests]{.underline}. When it comes to utilization of resources that
the melting of the Arctic ice will make more accessible, however, there
seems to be little disagreement about the prediction that states in the
region will be eager to exploit those resources. This is especially true
of the oil and gas reserves, in spite of the fact that the utilization
of those resources will further add to worldwide greenhouse gas
emission, intensifying the ecological and human security problems
created by climate change. When it comes to man´s right to exploit
nature, dominant values seem to be unchallenged. This brings us to the
feminist views of the relationship between humans and nature. Humans and
nature: domination or partnership? Climate change is an issue that does
not fit well with the power-seeking behavior of states described in
realist theories, since it is a phenomenon that has no respect for
national boundaries and calls for collective action. From the time of
the formation of the modern state in the 17th century Europe, natural
resources and geographical spaces have been viewed as resources for
increasing state power and wealth. Further strengthening this view was
the scientific revolution that also began in the 17th century; it
provided a more mechanistic view of nature than had been the previous
norm. Prior to this revolution, humans were considered to form an
integral part of nature, but during this period nature began to be
viewed as a machine to be exploited for human benefit (Tickner 1992).
Ecofeminism has made important contributions towards understanding the
relationship between humans and nature, pointing at the parallel between
the patriarchal system, where the masculine dominates the feminine, with
the domination of humans over nature. As MacGregor (2010) points out,
however, ecofeminism has been suffering from a negative reputation as
being spiritualist and essentialist and naturalizing of women´s
reproductive and domestic roles, and thus has received harsh criticism
from many feminist scholars. Yet, some more recent ecofeminist scholars
have rejected this essentialist connection between women and nature,
stressing instead that the oppression of women and the domination of
nature are both the result of patriarchy. "What all ecofeminists agree
about is that there are important connections between the domination of
women and the domination of nature," writes Warren (1998, p. 264). Part
of the problem is dualism in Western thought, whereby disjunctive pairs
are seen as opposite (rather than complementary) and exclusive (rather
than inclusive), and higher value (status, prestige) is attributed to
that which is higher than to that which is lower. Examples of this would
be twin concepts like: reason/emotion, mind/ body, culture/nature,
human/nature, and man/woman. [[Whatever is historically associated
with]{.mark} emotion, body, nature and [women]{.mark} is [regarded as
**inferior** to that which is associated with]{.mark} reason, mind,
culture, human (i.e. male), and [men]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
[[value-loaded dualism]{.mark} becomes a [part of a larger conceptual
framework]{.mark}, where **[socially constructed]{.mark}** sets of basic
beliefs, values, attitudes and [assumptions shape]{.mark} how one
[views]{.mark} oneself and others. A conceptual [framework is
**oppressive** when it]{.mark} **explains**, [**justifies**, and
**maintains**]{.mark} relationships of [**domination** and
**subordination**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Warren 1998). For ecofeminists,
[the [solution]{.mark} to these problems [includes]{.mark} [dismantling
the man made rift]{.mark} created between humans and
nature]{.underline}. For example, Ruether writes: "We need to think of
human consciousness not as separating us as a higher species from the
rest of nature, but rather as a gift to enable us to learn how to
harmonize our needs with the natural system around us, of which we are
dependent part," (Ruether 1993).

men prove their masculinity through performance such as military
combat.32 [The field of climate science has often been just another
function of this war machine that showed promise in allowing states to
predict, control and alter the natural world]{.underline}. Most
recently, resources have also been invested into investigating how
[geographic [areas]{.mark} vulnerable to climate change [can become

can prevent violent acts from being perpetrated in the homeland. Thus,
the alliance between the military and scientific research results in
solutions more consistent with military missions than with empowering
men and women to develop sustainable strategies for mitigation and
adaptation.34

#### Embrace a feminist ethic of care challenges patriarchy in the arctic and IR -- Epistemological and Ontological examinations are prior questions

Feminist care ethics and feminist foreign policy

In this final section, I want to suggest how an [[ethic of care]{.mark}
might [inform]{.mark} a [feminist foreign policy]{.mark} in ways that
allow it [to challenge]{.mark}, rather than reinforce, [gender]{.mark}ed
[binaries]{.mark} [between realism and idealism, order and justice and
masculine and feminine]{.mark}.]{.underline} I suggest that there are
three attributes of an [ethic of care]{.mark} that [allow]{.mark} it to
achieve this: [[relationality, contextualism]{.mark} and
[revisability]{.mark}]{.underline}.

As seen by Carol Gilligan, one of the first theorists of
[['care']{.mark} [as]{.mark} a voice of [**resistance to dominant**
modes]{.mark} of ethical reasoning, the ethics of care sees people not
as 'standing alone', but as gaining their selfhood through their
relations with others]{.underline}. Self and other are different but
connected rather than separate and opposed (Gilligan, 1993: 147).
Morality, on this view, is about responding to the needs of others in
ways that are characterized by attentive listening, patience and
understanding. Universal moral principles of right -- so [[rational,
clean]{.mark} and [appealing]{.mark} -- [give way]{.mark} here
[to]{.mark} the [messy, relentless]{.mark} juggling act of navigating
[complex moral dilemmas]{.mark} [and balanci]{.mark}ng the
[competing]{.mark} needs of real, **[embodied
others]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This means constant re-evaluation of
beliefs and reflexivity regarding our own claims to knowledge. It is a
feminist ethics, not because it 'belongs' to women or because it is
anti-men or somehow against the ethics of justice, but because it
demands a [[question]{.mark}ing of the [script of
patriarchy]{.mark}.]{.underline} As Gilligan puts it, in the culture of
patriarchy, the different voice with its ethic of care sounds feminine.
Heard in its own right and on its own terms, it is a human voice
([Gilligan,
2011](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1755088219828768#bibr6-1755088219828768):
25).

Relationality has been a key feature of the ethics of care since Carol
Gilligan's first edition of In a Different Voice. On this view, all
selves are the product of relations, all the way down. [The apparently
autonomous self, so often seen in men and gendered masculine, is a
product not of some essential feature of 'manhood' but of a response by
men to conform to the codes of gender within patriarchy.]{.underline}
Over the past 40 years, research into human psychology has undergone a
radical shift towards accepting the interpersonal and relational nature
of human development ([Gilligan and Snider,
2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1755088219828768#bibr7-1755088219828768):
191). Recognizing this and [[accepting]{.mark} the [relation]{.mark}al
voice]{.underline} not as morally or psychologically immature, but
[[as]{.mark} a [human voice]{.mark} that is [thwarted by]{.mark}
pervasive [gender norms]{.mark}]{.underline}, is the first step towards
[[reach]{.mark}ing [across divides]{.mark}]{.underline} of difference
hierarchy and [[build]{.mark}ing [real connection]{.mark} with
others]{.underline}.

[[Relationality is not]{.mark} a [static]{.mark} ethical
concept]{.underline} or set of principles -- like 'rights' or 'justice'
-- rather, it is a [[way of seeing]{.mark} the world
[that]{.mark}]{.underline} [[addresses]{.mark} not only
[ontology]{.mark}]{.underline} -- the relational self -- [[but also
epistemology]{.underline}]{.mark}. Thus, knowledge is also understood
relationally -- [we must [ask who makes]{.mark} the [knowledge
claims]{.mark} and [from what]{.mark} vantage point]{.underline}, what
[[material circumstances]{.underline}]{.mark} [and]{.mark} what [[degree
of power]{.underline}]{.mark} (Minow, 1990: 178). As famously argued by
Martha Minow, [relationality is perhaps most significant]{.underline} in
the way that it shifts our [understanding of the problem of
'difference']{.underline}; seeing [difference relationally means a shift
from a focus on the distinctions between people to a focus on the
relationships within]{.underline} which we notice and draw distinctions
([Minow,
1990](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1755088219828768#bibr23-1755088219828768):
15). Thus, [[relational]{.mark} [approach]{.mark}es, [unlike]{.mark},
say, [dominant liberal]{.mark} rights [analysis]{.mark}, enquire into
the institutional practices that determine a norm against which some
people seem different, or deviant]{.underline}. To address
relationships, Minow (1990) argues, is to [[resist abstraction
and]{.mark} to [demand context]{.mark}]{.underline} (1990: 216).

Clearly, there is a close connection between relationality and context.
[An [ethic of care eschews universalizable]{.mark} moral
[principles]{.mark}]{.underline} that can be applied across time and
space. By contrast, it [demands attention to context]{.underline} -- to
the particularities of social location, historical background,
structural conditions and relationships between relevant moral actors.
In this sense, it is opposed to the logic of traditional moral theory,
which demands abstraction from context in order to gain objectivity. But
this [[objectivity]{.mark} is elusive]{.underline}; more than this, [it
[acts to create]{.mark} a [dichotomy between those who]{.mark} are the
[know]{.mark}ers, keepers [and enforce]{.mark}rs]{.underline} of moral
principles, [[and those who are compelled]{.mark} -- sometimes [through
'foreign policy']{.mark}]{.underline} -- to enact those principles. The
morality of 'arms deals' cannot be assessed outside of the context of
both the violent histories of colonialism and the liberal militarism
that defines the contemporary world. Feminist foreign policy will not be
transformative if it is reduced to enacting a set of moral principles,
or seeking to protect, promote or empower women (often because this is,
in the long run, good for 'national security' or 'economic growth'). A
foreign policy that works towards feminist goals is more likely to be a
slow, plodding process which considers historical and contemporary
relations between actors and recognizes the importance of context in
making decisions and policies.

Finally, [[revisability]{.mark} [refers to]{.mark} the [requirement of
epistemological humility]{.mark}]{.underline} -- the need to embrace
uncertainty and recognize that there are only better or worse courses of
action at any given time and in any context. When 'Amy', one of
Gilligan's (1993) subjects, responds to a question posed regarding an
abstract moral dilemma, she says, 'Well, it depends' (1993: 35). As
Gilligan explains, when considered in the light of Kohlberg's definition
of the stages and sequence of moral development, her moral judgements
appear to be a full stage lower in maturity than those of the boy. They
appear to reveal an inability to think systematically about the concepts
of morality or law and a reluctance to examine the logic of received
moral truths (Gilligan, 1993: 30). But from the perspective of an ethic
of care, Amy's reluctance to make universalized judgements stems from a
heightened perception of the role of context and the nature of
relationships in moral judgement.

It is this willingness to [live with [uncertainty]{.mark}]{.underline}
that [[defines **feminist care ethics** as critical]{.underline}]{.mark}
and will allow it to be, potentially, [transformative [in the long
term]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Kimberly Hutchings (2001) argues,
'Critique is premised on the impossibility of a definitive answer to the
conditions of its own possibility and can only content itself with the
acknowledgment of the revisability of any grounds on which its specific
claims are based' (2001: 90). The implication of this is that we must
[[let go of]{.mark} the idea of feminist foreign policy as '[principled
foreign policy']{.mark}]{.underline}. Principles have an unmistakable
allure; they work very well when we take what Raymond Geuss (2008) calls
an 'ethics-first' approach to politics -- where we [attain an [ideal
theory]{.mark} [of]{.mark} how we should act]{.underline}, and then, in
a second step, [apply that ideal theory to the [action of political
agents]{.mark}]{.underline} (2008: 8). But the [dominance of this kind
of thinking [in]{.mark} the [realm of]{.mark} 'ethical [foreign
policy']{.mark} has [led to]{.mark} a
'[**hyper-rationalist**']{.mark}]{.underline} (Rengger, 2000: 769)
[[approach to]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[suffering]{.mark} of the
peoples of the world, [where '**useful knowledge'**]{.mark} has [blinded
us to]{.mark} contingency, [context, embodiment and
emotion]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Revisability in ethics is not the same thing as moral relativism. As
Susan Hekman points out, the category of 'relativism' is parasitic on
its opposite, the possibility of absolute knowledge. Perspectival,
connected, discursive knowledge does not obviate the possibility of
truth, evidence or critical judgement (Hekman, 1995: 31). It does not
mean that states cannot make judgements in their foreign (and domestic)
policy about the allocation of resources towards programmes and policies
that aim to increase the participation and representation of women in,
for example, formal peacemaking and peace-building processes. There is a
[requirement, however, to [view each policy]{.mark} and programme on its
own terms and [in its own context]{.mark}]{.underline} and to
[[recognize]{.underline}]{.mark} the ever-changing [context of
[actors-in-relation]{.mark} [across]{.mark}]{.underline} multiple,
intersecting locations and scales -- across [[racial,]{.mark}
socio-economic [and ethnic divides]{.mark}]{.underline} and from the
household [[to the **'global' level**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Assertions of ecological masculinity in the Arctic create destructive relationships with the environment, further ecological crisis, create security problems, and perpetuate violence against women

Gender, nature and ideology

My starting point is that an analysis of how [[far-right ideology
adopts]{.mark}, appropriates and communicates [varieties of
environmental thinking]{.mark}]{.underline} can be [[crystallised
through the **lens of gender**]{.underline}]{.mark}. According to
Forchtner and Kølvraa (2015), far-right ideology is connected to the
environment in different dimensions: the land is the [aesthetic
pride]{.underline} of the nation, a [material resource for its
survival]{.underline} and a symbol of [cultural hygiene]{.underline}.
Thus, the [[nation endures when]{.mark} its [territori]{.mark}al
integrity is [preserved and]{.mark} its **[purity
defended]{.mark}**]{.underline}. An examination of ELAM's visual
environmental communication shows that the concepts of [[purity and
control are central]{.mark} both [in]{.mark} nationalist ideology and
[patriarchal relations]{.mark}]{.underline} which, in turn, are
symbolically demonstrated in representations of the natural environment.
I echo here Douglas' (2003 \[1966\]) powerful thesis in Purity and
Danger where she argues that [[rituals of removing
pollution]{.underline}]{.mark} (dirt, dust, harmful substances) [are
[investments]{.mark} both [in cleanliness]{.mark}]{.underline} and in
communal formations of social boundaries. Indeed, as Forchtner (2019c)
has argued, the far right's [[quest for land purity]{.underline}]{.mark}
uses, among others, the language of 'invasive species' in the natural
world as a metaphor to describe the presence of migrants in the
territory of the endangered national group.

The gender symbolism of the natural environment has been meticulously
explored in Ortner's (1972) classic essay 'Is Female to Male as Nature
Is to Culture?', where she attempts to explain the question of women's
universal devaluation. Ortner argues that beyond the easily identifiable
practices of calling women inferior or assigning them to marginal
positions in society, there must be other symbolic ways through which
these practices are legitimised. She finds the answer in another
universal phenomenon: the relationship between nature and culture which
is a relationship of control. Thus, she points out: 'the pan-cultural
devaluation of woman could be accounted for, quite simply, by
postulating that [[woman]{.mark} is being [identified]{.mark}
[with]{.mark}, or symbolically associated with, [nature]{.mark}, as
[opposed to man]{.mark}, who is [identified with
culture']{.mark}]{.underline} (Ortner, 1972: 11--12).

Ortner argues that women's identification with nature begins with her
body and its reproductive function, is extended into the social roles
that reproduction entails (raising children, preparing food, sustaining
life) and ends with the belief that women are 'like nature' because they
are the key to procreation. Thus, women's physiology becomes their
destiny, and their mothering function reflects 'women's psyche'. In
contrast, men occupy the higher domain of culture and are seen as too
sophisticated to be tending to the needs of animal-like small species.
For Ortner, [[men]{.mark} are [tasked with]{.mark} developing [culture,
which]{.mark} oftentimes [involves]{.mark} regulating and [controlling
nature]{.mark} (hunting, [mining]{.mark}, [drilling]{.mark},
[exploring]{.mark}). As [women are, thus]{.mark}, seen as being closer
to nature than men, they are often [portrayed as]{.mark} driven by
[emotional]{.mark}, almost '[animalistic']{.mark}
instincts]{.underline}, while the cool, calm, collected figure of the
man is the rational voice in the room.

Beyond symbolism, connections between gender and the environment can be
traced on different levels. As a variable, gender determines differences
in attitudes between men and women, with women exhibiting greater
concern for environmental degradation (Joireman and Liu; 2014) even at a
young age (Zelezny et al., 2000). Interestingly, there are indications
that [[women's greater political participation]{.mark} in a country is
[linked to]{.mark} the country's [lower carbon]{.mark} dioxide
[emissions]{.mark}]{.underline} (Ergas and York, 2012). Other studies
have shown that gender effects are minimal compared to the explanatory
power of political affiliation and political ideology in accounting for
beliefs in climate change (Hornsey et al., 2016). Women also seem to
know more about climate change compared to men, although they tend to
underestimate the breadth of their knowledge (McCright, 2010). Men's
lack of urgency for the environment has been dubbed the 'cool dude'
effect (McCright and Dunlap, 2011), which is partially explained by the
type of white conservative male who overrates his understanding of
global warming while endorsing denialist views. Some of this variability
can be accounted for by differential gendered vulnerabilities in
relation to the immediate and long-term impact of climate change
(Pearse, 2017). [Feminist perspectives emphasise that [this is a direct
result of]{.mark} structural constraints in the [social positioning of
men and women]{.mark}]{.underline} and note that these constraints are
even more pronounced for women in the Global South (Roy, 2018).

This is where the space of ecofeminist thought has expanded the gender--
environment connection beyond mainstream approaches. Despite
essentialist undertones associated with its rise in the 1970s,
ecofeminism is not about women who believe they can save the earth
simply because they are women. Gaard (2015), for example, steers away
from approaches where women are called to 'mother the Earth' or are
constructed as victims of environmental destruction. Instead, she
proposes an ecofeminist, intersectional approach and argues that:

> [[\[C\]limate change and]{.mark} first world [overconsumption are
> produced by **Masculinist Ideology**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}
> and will [[not]{.mark} be [solved by **Masculinist
> Techno-Science**]{.mark}]{.underline} approaches.
> **[Instead]{.underline}**, I propose, [queer [feminist posthumanist
> climate justice]{.mark} perspectives [at the local, national,]{.mark}
> and [global levels]{.mark}]{.underline} are [**[needed]{.underline}**
> to]{.mark} intervene and [transform]{.mark} [both our
> [analyses]{.mark}]{.underline} [and]{.mark} our [[solutions to climate
> change]{.underline}]{.mark}. (Gaard, 2015: 20--21)

The [contribution of feminist theory to radicalising environmental
thought lies in [critiquing]{.mark} both [masculine ideals and]{.mark}
the [patriarchal practices]{.mark}]{.underline} [that underpin]{.mark}
the [[destruction of the environment]{.mark}]{.underline} (Warren, 2000;
Plumwood, 2002) while, at the same time, [[open]{.mark}ing up the
[debate]{.mark}]{.underline} [to]{.mark} other intersections of
[[dominance and exploitation]{.underline}]{.mark}. This has extended
feminist theoretical explorations of care into the animal world and our
relations with other non-human species (Kheel, 2008; Adams and Gruen,
2014). Kheel (2008), for example, develops Carol Gilligan's [['ethic of
care']{.underline}]{.mark} into the idea of 'contextualized care', that
is, employing empathy in our relations with the living world and
avoiding harm and exploitation. Thus, [ecofeminism [shift]{.mark}s
[ecological debates to questions of control, oppression and
domination]{.mark}]{.underline} that run as key themes in both gender
relations and relations between humans and the environment.

Building on these foundations is the notion of 'ecological
masculinities' (Hultman and Pulé, 2018; Pulé and Hultman, 2021), which
embraces the feminist critique of domination of nature and argues that a
critical examination of [[industrial masculinities needs to be part of
these debates.]{.underline}]{.mark} Indeed, [[hegemonic versions of
masculinity]{.mark} have been [at]{.mark} the
[forefront]{.mark}]{.underline} of encounters wit[h nature given that
hunting, [colonial conquest and oil rigging]{.mark}]{.underline} have
not only been [[means of]{.mark} [accumulating]{.mark} economic
[wealth]{.mark}]{.underline} or developing [[innovative
science]{.underline}]{.mark} but also [[domains of masculine
validation]{.mark}]{.underline} (Pulé et al., 2021). Thus, any [[effort
to address]{.mark} the current [climate crisis]{.mark}]{.underline} or
humanity's relationship with the environment [[must resist]{.mark} those
instances where a camouflaged [ecological
masculinity]{.mark}]{.underline} mimics ecological thinking. As I show,
the parochial environmental agenda of ELAM in Cyprus belongs in this
category as it serves narrow populist interests. More importantly, I
argue that [they]{.mark} do not adopt an ecological [approach]{.mark} to
[climate change]{.mark} but see this as an opportunity [to [restore
hegemonic masculinity]{.underline} through]{.mark} the brawny [[male
performance]{.mark} of saving the burning land]{.underline} and
liberating occupied areas

and elsewhere, the modern fields of science such as meteorology, physics

the bipolarization of gender identities]{.underline} in extremis for the
purpose of waging war.31 This bipolarization perpetuates a system where
men prove their masculinity through performance such as military
combat.32 [The field of climate science has often been just another
function of this war machine that showed promise in allowing states to
predict, control and alter the natural world]{.underline}. Most
recently, resources have also been invested into investigating how
[geographic [areas]{.mark} vulnerable to climate change [can become
breeding grounds for]{.mark} political [instability and
terrorism]{.mark}]{.underline} and ways in which military intervention
can prevent violent acts from being perpetrated in the homeland. Thus,
the alliance between the military and scientific research results in
solutions more consistent with military missions than with empowering
men and women to develop sustainable strategies for mitigation and
adaptation.34

#### Embrace a feminist ethic of care challenges patriarchy in the arctic and IR -- Epistemological and Ontological examinations are prior questions

Feminist care ethics and feminist foreign policy

In this final section, I want to suggest how an [[ethic of care]{.mark}
might [inform]{.mark} a [feminist foreign policy]{.mark} in ways that
allow it [to challenge]{.mark}, rather than reinforce, [gender]{.mark}ed
[binaries]{.mark} [between realism and idealism, order and justice and
masculine and feminine]{.mark}.]{.underline} I suggest that there are
three attributes of an [ethic of care]{.mark} that [allow]{.mark} it to
achieve this: [[relationality, contextualism]{.mark} and
[revisability]{.mark}]{.underline}.

As seen by Carol Gilligan, one of the first theorists of
[['care']{.mark} [as]{.mark} a voice of [**resistance to dominant**
modes]{.mark} of ethical reasoning, the ethics of care sees people not
as 'standing alone', but as gaining their selfhood through their
relations with others]{.underline}. Self and other are different but
connected rather than separate and opposed (Gilligan, 1993: 147).
Morality, on this view, is about responding to the needs of others in
ways that are characterized by attentive listening, patience and
understanding. Universal moral principles of right -- so [[rational,
clean]{.mark} and [appealing]{.mark} -- [give way]{.mark} here
[to]{.mark} the [messy, relentless]{.mark} juggling act of navigating
[complex moral dilemmas]{.mark} [and balanci]{.mark}ng the
[competing]{.mark} needs of real, **[embodied
others]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This means constant re-evaluation of
beliefs and reflexivity regarding our own claims to knowledge. It is a
feminist ethics, not because it 'belongs' to women or because it is
anti-men or somehow against the ethics of justice, but because it
demands a [[question]{.mark}ing of the [script of
patriarchy]{.mark}.]{.underline} As Gilligan puts it, in the culture of
patriarchy, the different voice with its ethic of care sounds feminine.
Heard in its own right and on its own terms, it is a human voice
([Gilligan,
2011](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1755088219828768#bibr6-1755088219828768):
25).

Relationality has been a key feature of the ethics of care since Carol
Gilligan's first edition of In a Different Voice. On this view, all
selves are the product of relations, all the way down. [The apparently
autonomous self, so often seen in men and gendered masculine, is a
product not of some essential feature of 'manhood' but of a response by
men to conform to the codes of gender within patriarchy.]{.underline}
Over the past 40 years, research into human psychology has undergone a
radical shift towards accepting the interpersonal and relational nature
of human development ([Gilligan and Snider,
2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1755088219828768#bibr7-1755088219828768):
191). Recognizing this and [[accepting]{.mark} the [relation]{.mark}al
voice]{.underline} not as morally or psychologically immature, but
[[as]{.mark} a [human voice]{.mark} that is [thwarted by]{.mark}
pervasive [gender norms]{.mark}]{.underline}, is the first step towards
[[reach]{.mark}ing [across divides]{.mark}]{.underline} of difference
hierarchy and [[build]{.mark}ing [real connection]{.mark} with
others]{.underline}.

[[Relationality is not]{.mark} a [static]{.mark} ethical
concept]{.underline} or set of principles -- like 'rights' or 'justice'
-- rather, it is a [[way of seeing]{.mark} the world
[that]{.mark}]{.underline} [[addresses]{.mark} not only
[ontology]{.mark}]{.underline} -- the relational self -- [[but also
epistemology]{.underline}]{.mark}. Thus, knowledge is also understood
relationally -- [we must [ask who makes]{.mark} the [knowledge
claims]{.mark} and [from what]{.mark} vantage point]{.underline}, what
[[material circumstances]{.underline}]{.mark} [and]{.mark} what [[degree
of power]{.underline}]{.mark} (Minow, 1990: 178). As famously argued by
Martha Minow, [relationality is perhaps most significant]{.underline} in
the way that it shifts our [understanding of the problem of
'difference']{.underline}; seeing [difference relationally means a shift
from a focus on the distinctions between people to a focus on the
relationships within]{.underline} which we notice and draw distinctions
([Minow,
1990](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1755088219828768#bibr23-1755088219828768):
15). Thus, [[relational]{.mark} [approach]{.mark}es, [unlike]{.mark},
say, [dominant liberal]{.mark} rights [analysis]{.mark}, enquire into
the institutional practices that determine a norm against which some
people seem different, or deviant]{.underline}. To address
relationships, Minow (1990) argues, is to [[resist abstraction
and]{.mark} to [demand context]{.mark}]{.underline} (1990: 216).

Clearly, there is a close connection between relationality and context.
[An [ethic of care eschews universalizable]{.mark} moral
[principles]{.mark}]{.underline} that can be applied across time and
space. By contrast, it [demands attention to context]{.underline} -- to
the particularities of social location, historical background,
structural conditions and relationships between relevant moral actors.
In this sense, it is opposed to the logic of traditional moral theory,
which demands abstraction from context in order to gain objectivity. But
this [[objectivity]{.mark} is elusive]{.underline}; more than this, [it
[acts to create]{.mark} a [dichotomy between those who]{.mark} are the
[know]{.mark}ers, keepers [and enforce]{.mark}rs]{.underline} of moral
principles, [[and those who are compelled]{.mark} -- sometimes [through
'foreign policy']{.mark}]{.underline} -- to enact those principles. The
morality of 'arms deals' cannot be assessed outside of the context of
both the violent histories of colonialism and the liberal militarism
that defines the contemporary world. Feminist foreign policy will not be
transformative if it is reduced to enacting a set of moral principles,
or seeking to protect, promote or empower women (often because this is,
in the long run, good for 'national security' or 'economic growth'). A
foreign policy that works towards feminist goals is more likely to be a
slow, plodding process which considers historical and contemporary
relations between actors and recognizes the importance of context in
making decisions and policies.

Finally, [[revisability]{.mark} [refers to]{.mark} the [requirement of
epistemological humility]{.mark}]{.underline} -- the need to embrace
uncertainty and recognize that there are only better or worse courses of
action at any given time and in any context. When 'Amy', one of
Gilligan's (1993) subjects, responds to a question posed regarding an
abstract moral dilemma, she says, 'Well, it depends' (1993: 35). As
Gilligan explains, when considered in the light of Kohlberg's definition
of the stages and sequence of moral development, her moral judgements
appear to be a full stage lower in maturity than those of the boy. They
appear to reveal an inability to think systematically about the concepts
of morality or law and a reluctance to examine the logic of received
moral truths (Gilligan, 1993: 30). But from the perspective of an ethic
of care, Amy's reluctance to make universalized judgements stems from a
heightened perception of the role of context and the nature of
relationships in moral judgement.

It is this willingness to [live with [uncertainty]{.mark}]{.underline}
that [[defines **feminist care ethics** as critical]{.underline}]{.mark}
and will allow it to be, potentially, [transformative [in the long
term]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Kimberly Hutchings (2001) argues,
'Critique is premised on the impossibility of a definitive answer to the
conditions of its own possibility and can only content itself with the
acknowledgment of the revisability of any grounds on which its specific
claims are based' (2001: 90). The implication of this is that we must
[[let go of]{.mark} the idea of feminist foreign policy as '[principled
foreign policy']{.mark}]{.underline}. Principles have an unmistakable
allure; they work very well when we take what Raymond Geuss (2008) calls
an 'ethics-first' approach to politics -- where we [attain an [ideal
theory]{.mark} [of]{.mark} how we should act]{.underline}, and then, in
a second step, [apply that ideal theory to the [action of political
agents]{.mark}]{.underline} (2008: 8). But the [dominance of this kind
of thinking [in]{.mark} the [realm of]{.mark} 'ethical [foreign
policy']{.mark} has [led to]{.mark} a
'[**hyper-rationalist**']{.mark}]{.underline} (Rengger, 2000: 769)
[[approach to]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[suffering]{.mark} of the
peoples of the world, [where '**useful knowledge'**]{.mark} has [blinded
us to]{.mark} contingency, [context, embodiment and
emotion]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Revisability in ethics is not the same thing as moral relativism. As
Susan Hekman points out, the category of 'relativism' is parasitic on
its opposite, the possibility of absolute knowledge. Perspectival,
connected, discursive knowledge does not obviate the possibility of
truth, evidence or critical judgement (Hekman, 1995: 31). It does not
mean that states cannot make judgements in their foreign (and domestic)
policy about the allocation of resources towards programmes and policies
that aim to increase the participation and representation of women in,
for example, formal peacemaking and peace-building processes. There is a
[requirement, however, to [view each policy]{.mark} and programme on its
own terms and [in its own context]{.mark}]{.underline} and to
[[recognize]{.underline}]{.mark} the ever-changing [context of
[actors-in-relation]{.mark} [across]{.mark}]{.underline} multiple,
intersecting locations and scales -- across [[racial,]{.mark}
socio-economic [and ethnic divides]{.mark}]{.underline} and from the
household [[to the **'global' level**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Method and material: justification analysis of Arctic hydrocarbon
companies' self-representation

This paper examines Norwegian and Russian companies' perceptions of the
Arctic and the image they model for the public with material consisting
of sections of three Arctic energy company webpages. I approach the
webpages through a feminist version of justification analysis, including
some discussion on visual methods. Justification analysis builds on the
work of Boltanski and Thévenot, De La Justification (On Justification,
1991\[2006\]). Their core idea is that [in order to convince other
people in public discussion, one must justify such a position by
referring to a generally accepted common goo]{.underline}d[.
[Within]{.mark} public [debates]{.mark}, a limited [set of moral
principles]{.mark} is [utilized to support]{.mark} such [arguments. For
example, justifying]{.mark} a [claim in econ]{.mark}omic [terms means
taking a moral stand wherein money is the measure of
worth]{.mark}]{.underline} (YläAnttila & Luhtakallio, 2016, p.2). Moral
principles are widely shared by different participants but are often
understood differently (Ylä-Anttila & Luhtakallio, 2016). [In the
[context of the Arctic hydrocarbon industry, justification
analysis]{.mark} is useful in [revealing and challenging]{.mark} the
[values]{.mark} on which the companies base their continuous
operations]{.underline}. Understandings of the "common good" vary across
time and society; however, Boltanski and Thevénot have proposed six
"worlds of justification" based on values commonly recognised by
societies in general. The seventh justification was added later. The
fixed [[frames, or worlds, of justification are based on values emerging
from the industrial, civic, market-oriented, fame-driven, ecological,
domestic and inspirational domains]{.underline}]{.mark}. Boltanski and
Thevénot (2006, pp.203--201) describe the industrial world as one
dominated by technology, efficiency and progress. In the context of this
article, the industrial world refers to the importance of new
technologies being utilised by the Arctic oil and gas industry as well
as the importance of technology in addressing environmental concerns.
The civic world is one where value is not given to individuals, but to
the collectives they form. Legal systems and civic rights are the basis
of this value (Boltanski & Thévenot, 2006, pp.185--193) as well as
democratic means of agreeing on the rules (Ylä-Anttila & Luhtakallio,
2016). In this research, the worlds based on civic values refer to the
companies' responsibility to produce energy for the world, to work
within the constraints of existing legislation and to bring benefits to
local communities. In the market world, "actions are motivated by
desire" (Boltanski & Thévenot, 2006, p.196). Objects considered worthy
of desire are those that have value or a strong position in the market.
Therefore, the market world refers here to the economic value of the
Arctic hydrocarbon industry both for the companies' shareholders and for
the respective countries. Within the world of fame, the opinion of
others plays a crucial role, in addition to visibility and notoriety.
Being recognised for what one does is important (Boltanski & Thévevnot,
2006). In the context of this study, fame is understood and presented as
the companies being perceived as leaders and pioneers in the Arctic
realm, much in the manner of early polar explorers. In the ecological
world well-being of the environment is the focal point (Thévevnot,
Moody, & Lafaye, 2000). In this study, the ecological world refers to
the well-being of the pristine Arctic environment and its flora and
fauna. In the domestic world, according to Boltanski and Thévenot (2006,
pp.164--165), the worth given to the objects is based on their
contribution to hierarchical relations among people, as connected to
generations and tradition. In the research material, the domestic world
can be understood as the value that, for example, the gas distribution
system in Russia brings to the country. The inspirational world was not
visible in the research material and so will not be a point of focus in
this research. From this initial premise, scholars have developed a
method of [justification analysis]{.underline} (Ylä-Anttila & Kukkonen,
2014; Ylä-Anttila & Luhtakallio, 2016[) to analyse the claims made and
the moral stands taken in public debates.]{.underline} Within public
media justification analysis, [[a unit of analysis consists of one
claim]{.mark}. A claim is [a "unit of action in the public
sphere"]{.mark}]{.underline} (Koopmans, 2006). [A claim can be [a
statement]{.mark}]{.underline} made to a reporter, [a [speech,
or]{.mark},]{.underline} for example, [a
[demonstration]{.mark}]{.underline} (Koopmans, 2006; Ylä-Anttila &
Luhtakallio, 2016). Once such a claim is made, justification analysis
assesses the given worth or value upon it is based. A combination of
values can be found in a single claim. As with many social science
methods, the coding of the claims is not inductive, but based on fixed
categories -- the worths. Therefore, [justification analysis is
[**especially** suitable for **comparative analysis**]{.mark}, as the
cases are approached from the same justification principles]{.underline}
(Ylä-Anttila & Luhtakallio, 2016). Justification analysis has been
utilised mainly for analysing mass media (Ylä-Anttila et al., 2018;
Ylä-Anttila & Kukkonen, 2014; Ylä-Anttila & Luhtakallio, 2016) but also
for Russian energy strategies (Salonen, 2018). Employing justification
analysis to assess company webpages differs somewhat from the analysis
of traditional media material. The webpages of hydrocarbon companies
exist for a certain reason -- the webpages themselves are crafted to
convince the audience of the validity of the claims. Therefore, while a
newspaper article may contain, for example, three claims for a story, I
argue that a webpage itself is one large claim, and the analysis aims to
identify the nature of the values upon which the individual underlying
claims are based. Following the path laid out by Ylä-Anttila and
Luhtakallio (2016) and Salonen (2018), I first determined the sections
of the material that contained a specific claim. Second, I identified
claims that make a reference to a world (or worlds). Finally, I
identified and categorised the claims and their references according to
the fixed worlds of justification. For example, going through the
webpages of Equinor, I first identified the sections that made a
specific claim (e.g. section Sustainability) and after that went through
the content sentence by sentence and identified the claims that refer to
the fixed worlds of justification (e.g. ecological world). Because this
research is qualitative in nature, the frequency of the claims is not
discussed extensively, but rather the focus is on their content. Since
the material consists of webpages, it would be limiting to exclude a
large portion of their content -- images. We live in an era of
visuality, and so visual analysis should not be ignored when analysing
webpages. Hence, this article also draws from discussions on visual
methodology to present the webpages in their entirety. Haraway (1988,
p.581) has explored social power relations with respect to the
availability of visual "gluttony" and how it is linked to a "history of
science tied to militarism, capitalism, colonialism, and male
supremacy." Such power relations produce social differences (e.g.
hierarchies of class, gender, race), while claiming to not belong to any
hierarchy (Haraway, 1988). This is especially interesting when
considering oil and gas companies, as the fossil fuel industry is one of
the most powerful industries in the world.

Webpages utilised to create a desire for Arctic exploration

The material for this article consists of certain sections from the
webpages of three hydrocarbon companies (collected in summer/fall 2019)
working in the Arctic. The webpages of energy companies tend to
represent a general company policy -- or at least what the companies
expect the public to perceive positively, and therefore, the webpages
help them gain public support. The webpages presumably target the
national political sphere, international consumer states, investors and
civil society. The audience is not homogeneous -- therefore,
justification strategies differ. [By studying the material produced by
the energy industry, one can "understand better what kind of power,
truths and identities" the industry is constructing]{.underline}
(Tynkkynen, 2016, p.375). The [energy industry utilises advertising to
"establish a desire for opening Arctic regions to commercial
exploitation"]{.underline} (Mason, 2016). I do not approach the
[webpages]{.underline} as sources of a single truth, but rather as a
[way for the industry to present its claims to the public]{.underline}.
The webpages of state-owned companies are clearly an aspect of
marketing, but also a tool and even a platform for discussion. The
webpages actively stake out a position for companies in societal
discussions. For example on Equinor's webpage, a section focusing on the
activities in the Barents Sea includes a sub-section Concerns and
Frequently asked questions, with both sections directly addressing the
concerns of environmental organisations about Arctic drilling (see, e.g.
Greenpeace Norge). Gazprom Neft's webpages only discuss the
environmental effects of an individual project regarding Prirazlomnoye,
an offshore platform that received much international attention in 2013
when Greenpeace activists were arrested for trying to seize the
operation for environmental reasons (Greenpeace Russia, 2019).
Prirazlomnoye, however, is currently the only offshore project in the
Russian Arctic, which could further raise environmental concerns linked
to it. Comparisons of the Norwegian, Russian and English webpages
revealed that the content on the webpages was approximately the same
regardless of the language. Hence, this study is limited to the English
versions of the company webpages. The webpages are rich in content and
consist of text, photos, videos and reports. To begin, I went through
all the sections to get an idea of their content. Next, I focused on the
sections connected to Arctic hydrocarbon activities. The homepages of
all the companies and company overviews provided were included in the
analysis. In addition, other parts focus on ongoing Arctic projects
(with subsections) as well as on activities in the Arctic (for example,
Equinor's webpages include sections such as Our activities in the North
and Safely exploring the Barents Sea). Sections focusing on the
environment, sustainability and engagement with indigenous peoples (for
example, Gazprom Neft's webpages include a section on Engaging with the
peoples of the Russian Far North) were included. The webpages ranged
from August to October 2019. Since the webpages are "living," meaning
they are being continuously updated, the material was transferred to
separate documents and the analysis was conducted from there.

**[The gendered worlds of justification]{.underline}**

After reading through the research material with the help of
justification analysis, six worlds of justification and their
combinations were identified. Based on the findings, the following four
subsections have been organized thematically. The first subsection
addresses the [importance of technology and its ability to overcome both
physical challenges as well as challenges related to climate change and
the environment]{.underline}. The second subsection focuses on the [role
of the economy]{.underline}. In addition, it also [compares early polar
explorers with the search for new oil and gas fields as well as the
[discourse of being]{.mark} an [Arctic leader]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
third subsection assesses the meaning of the ecological world in the
webpages. Furthermore, it also focuses on the [[representations of
gender]{.underline}]{.mark}. The fourth subsection discusses the
companies' [[emphasis on]{.mark} the [wider benefits]{.mark} of having
an industry in one's country and community]{.underline}. The [first two
subsections]{.underline} and the worlds they present navigate in the
discursive and cultural constructions [[historically associated with
masculine practices]{.mark}, working in the public domain instead of the
private]{.underline}. The last two subsections move somewhere in between
masculine and feminine discursive and cultural constructions (MacGregor,
2010). The analysis shows how the companies are [building the
justifications while [**reproducing** and **reinforcing** the **gendered
foundations**]{.mark} and stereotypes]{.underline}. Excerpts from the
research material are utilized to demonstrate how the justifications
serve the interests of oil and gas companies.

#### 5. The question of how you obtained your research is a prior question

In practice, this theoretical approach lets us think of the constitutive
other of the research subject as a social construction rather than as
separable from the would-be researcher/scholar. Thinking of the
constitutive other of the research subject as a social construction
broadens the ways that we can think about the impact of research in four
ways. First, the research has impact on the researcher: impact that is
political, sociological, economic, and psychological (e.g., Kusic and
Zahora 2020). Second, **[[research has everyday
impacts]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Thinking back to Marysia Zalewski's
(1996) typology of theories, *theory can be problem-solving (the
traditional use in mainstream IR), critique (the modal use in critical
IR), and action or lived. It is this last sort of theorizing that
deconstructing the subject/object dichotomy sheds light on: theory as
action*. **[When would-be [IR]{.mark} researchers do [research]{.mark},
that [itself]{.mark} is action "in the world" which [has impacts in that
world]{.mark}]{.underline}**---that is, **[the everyday]{.underline}**,
around the researcher and the researched---**[[in the community in
which]{.mark} the research is produced, in the community in which the
[research is done]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} in the community in which the
research is [disseminated]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Third, *research has
political, social, and economic impacts in its citation, repetition,
promotion, and publication*. **[Each time research is shared, tweeted,
and discussed, that is an act in itself with implications. Fourth,
research has impacts on the ways that readers of research understand and
see the people or institutions understood to be the subject of the
research]{.underline}***; such that research becomes a lens through
which those othered in it are consumed by those who read it*. Across
these four contexts, we make the argument that **[there is [no such
thing as non-violent]{.mark} or non-harmful
[research]{.mark}.]{.underline}** We contend that *reflection on the
violences involved in one's own participation both in the system of
research production in which we live and work, and in particular
research, is key to understanding the perverse effects and potential
harms of research*, in both substantive and methodological choice. *Each
research design choice includes and excludes some people; benefits and
harms some people; supports some people distributing benefits and harms
to others*; has political, economic, social, and planetary footprints.
*The question becomes not whether harm is done, but what harm and to
whom, and how it can be managed, understood, and minimized.*

In practice, this theoretical approach lets us think of the constitutive
other of the research subject as a social construction rather than as
separable from the would-be researcher/scholar. Thinking of the
constitutive other of the research subject as a social construction
broadens the ways that we can think about the impact of research in four
ways. First, the research has impact on the researcher: impact that is
political, sociological, economic, and psychological (e.g., Kusic and
Zahora 2020). Second, **[[research has everyday
impacts]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Thinking back to Marysia Zalewski's
(1996) typology of theories, *theory can be problem-solving (the
traditional use in mainstream IR), critique (the modal use in critical
IR), and action or lived. It is this last sort of theorizing that
deconstructing the subject/object dichotomy sheds light on: theory as
action*. **[When would-be [IR]{.mark} researchers do [research]{.mark},
that [itself]{.mark} is action "in the world" which [has impacts in that
world]{.mark}]{.underline}**---that is, **[the everyday]{.underline}**,
around the researcher and the researched---**[[in the community in
which]{.mark} the research is produced, in the community in which the
[research is done]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} in the community in which the
research is [disseminated]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Third, *research has
political, social, and economic impacts in its citation, repetition,
promotion, and publication*. **[Each time research is shared, tweeted,
and discussed, that is an act in itself with implications. Fourth,
research has impacts on the ways that readers of research understand and
see the people or institutions understood to be the subject of the
research]{.underline}***; such that research becomes a lens through
which those othered in it are consumed by those who read it*. Across
these four contexts, we make the argument that **[there is [no such
thing as non-violent]{.mark} or non-harmful
[research]{.mark}.]{.underline}** We contend that *reflection on the
violences involved in one's own participation both in the system of
research production in which we live and work, and in particular
research, is key to understanding the perverse effects and potential
harms of research*, in both substantive and methodological choice. *Each
research design choice includes and excludes some people; benefits and
harms some people; supports some people distributing benefits and harms
to others*; has political, economic, social, and planetary footprints.
*The question becomes not whether harm is done, but what harm and to
whom, and how it can be managed, understood, and minimized.*
*[Coming]{.mark} [to terms with]{.mark} the [violence]{.mark} in one's

[[Some]{.underline}]{.mark} might [[argue]{.mark} that [a specific focus
on women]{.mark} unduly [narrows the scope of our concerns]{.mark} and
fails to show the broader impact of feminist scholarship;]{.underline}
that [this is an old-fashioned approach]{.underline}. It is important to
point out that the focus of this volume is partly a political
move---much writing on war and violence (without explicitly stating
this) is on man and the state. In this volume, [[the focus is on
women]{.underline}]{.mark} and the everyday, even as men and states are
certainly part of the mix, [[because **we still know too little
about**]{.mark} **[women in global
politic]{.mark}**]{.underline}**[s]{.mark}**---and miss much about how
power in global politics works by not looking for them. As Cynthia Enloe
(1990, pp. 197--198) notes, [we need to look for women because '[it has
taken]{.mark} [power to deprive women]{.mark} of land titles [and leave
them little choice but]{.mark} to sexually [serve]{.mark} soldiers and
banana workers.]{.underline} [It has taken power [to keep women out
of]{.mark} their countries' diplomatic [corps and]{.mark} out of the
upper reaches of [the]{.mark} World [Bank]{.mark}.']{.underline} What is
more, it is also important that we dig deeper because 'it has taken
power to keep questions of inequity between local men and women off the
agendas of many national movements in industrialized as well as agrarian
societies. [[It]{.mark} [has taken power to construct]{.mark} popular
[culture]{.mark}---films, advertisements, books, fairs,

International Relations; akshaj\]

[[**Do-gooder** status]{.mark} seeking]{.underline}

For [certain small and middle [powers]{.mark}]{.underline}, conspicuous
**[[do-goodism]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- as [[opposed
to]{.underline}]{.mark} the conspicuous [consumption or
[competition]{.mark}]{.underline} to which [great powers]{.underline}
are [attracted]{.underline} -- seems to work in [realising]{.underline}
the same [basic **[drive for status]{.mark}**]{.underline} that the
[standard model assumes [generates **competition** and
**war**]{.mark}]{.underline}. At least, the examples discussed here
(Norway and its peers) suggest this is the case. Indeed, the Norwegian
case yields little evidence of much dissatisfaction with the country's
standing among either the elites or the voters. And this raises the
question of precisely how various kinds of [[behaviour]{.mark} are
[linked to the **desire** for status]{.mark}]{.underline}. The standard
model assumes that [[**conflictual behaviour** promises that if the
actor 'wins']{.underline}]{.mark} whatever the competitive game may be,
this will [solve the problem the actor is experiencing with
status]{.underline}. If all goes well, the [dissatisfied state will win
a war, prevail in a crisis]{.underline}, or build a gleaming new fleet
of aircraft carriers -- and somehow that will bring social responses
from key others that are more [[congenial to the state's
self-esteem]{.underline}]{.mark}. In most treatments, this appears to
[[arise from]{.mark} the clear [**demotion** of some other
actor]{.mark}]{.underline} -- the putative loser of the war or crisis,
or the state whose own [carrier fleet]{.underline} is somehow
[devalued]{.underline}. But for Norway, being conspicuously
[[useful]{.mark} or saliently [helping to solve
problems]{.mark}]{.underline} may well generate a similar result
[without [explicitly]{.mark} defeating or [**deflating**
others]{.mark}]{.underline}. And although this almost certainly has the
[effect of [diminishing]{.mark} the [social and psychological
**satisfaction**]{.mark}]{.underline} of some [competing do-good
states]{.underline} (say, Sweden or Denmark) with its own standing, it
[does not]{.underline} necessarily [[entail the defeat]{.mark} or
demotion [of]{.mark} a [rival]{.mark}]{.underline}.

This [raises the question of how similar the [two **manifestations** of
status politics]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [[dangerous]{.underline}]{.mark}
or expensive [[rivalry vs conspicuous do-goodism]{.underline}]{.mark} --
really are. Are we really comparing apples to apples? The absence of
evidence of deference does give one pause. Small states defer to great
powers, seem to win status from some, may indeed attain some standing in
their relevant community, but at first glance, do not saliently lord it
over other lesser actors. One promising case that needs more work in a
status perspective is the one of development aid. It is a standard point
in the literature on gift- and aid-giving that, when a gift is not
reciprocated, the result may be a fall in status on behalf of the
non-giver.Footnote 64 Such a fall in status may induce deference towards
the aid-giver. There is a lot of anecdotal evidence that Norway receives
this kind of deference in certain contexts, in certain small state
receivers of aid. We also note that, Norway's do-good status
notwithstanding, both Kenya and Ethiopia have in recent years broken off
diplomatic relations with Norway.Footnote 65 This may or may not have
happened in the [[context of status games]{.underline}]{.mark}. We do
not know, and these questions await further research. While we wait,
given that for some scholars deference is definitive of status, sceptics
may wonder how high any small or middle power's standing can be unless
more evidence of others' deference is produced.

If we set aside that reservation, [the [arguments and evidence
produced]{.mark}]{.underline} here strongly confirm the [claims in the
**[literature]{.mark}** that status [is social, relational, and
positional]{.mark}]{.underline}. States like Norway do not compete with
Russia or China for status, but seek instead to distinguish themselves
from other [[smaller states]{.mark} in a [setting in]{.mark} which both
rival do-gooders and [key relevant **status-superiors** value the
cooperative and socially desirable dimensions]{.mark}]{.underline} on
which they seek to maintain high standing. For most of recorded history,
states or other polities at the top of international systems have
[[valued]{.mark} [military **prowess** and awarded status to victorious
**competitors**]{.mark}]{.underline}.Footnote 66 But if Ned Lebow is
right that the [[current]{.mark} international [system]{.mark} is on the
[cusp of]{.mark} a major [change]{.mark} in status norms]{.underline},
it is tempting to speculate that, with a different set of status norms,
[[status]{.mark} politics [at]{.mark} the **[great power
level]{.mark}**]{.underline} could be [channeled]{.underline} in a
similarly benign direction in a kind of [inter-state version of a
potlatch]{.underline} society.Footnote 67 Exploring that hypothesis
would require careful dyadic studies of rivalry vs cooperation, and
conspicuous consumption vs conspicuous do-goodism, as modes of status
seeking.

Industrial world -- technology will save us?

Since the companies are working in harsh conditions, the role of
technology is important. All the companies put an especially visible
focus on the industrial world. Justifications based on technological
measures and the belief in technology are strong: Drawing on technology,
competence and experience from harsh weather operations, we are
approaching the North with a strong focus on safe operations and respect
for the environment. Research and development programs are tailored to
meet the technological challenges ahead, such as drilling and production
systems, long distance transportation of unprocessed oil and gas,
material science, oil spill response and health and working environment
in cold climates. (Equinor, 2019) Unique technological and logistical
solutions mean oil is being produced, stored, shipped and transported
all year round under the ultra-challenging environmental and climatic
conditions of the waters of the Arctic. (Gazprom Neft, 2019) Overcoming
the Yamal Peninsula's harsh climate and environment, Gazprom has made
Yamal its launch pad for efficient, safe and innovative technologies and
technical solutions. (Gazprom, 2019) An emphasis on technology and
infrastructure utilized within the operations conducted in the harsh
conditions of the Arctic is visible throughout the webpages. In
addition, technology is important for the challenges of addressing
environmental questions. The visual side of the material emphasises the
technologyoriented nature of the industry -- a large number of the
photos on all the company websites show production facilities and
provide technical details. Often, the images are from a bird's-eye
perspective observing the production facilities or the Arctic
wilderness. This reminds me of Haraway's concept of the god trick "of
seeing everything from nowhere," in which [modern technology has "put
the myth into ordinary practice. And like the god trick, this eye fucks
the world to make techno-monsters"]{.underline} (Haraway, 1988, p.581).
The opening image on Gazprom's website is an aerial image of Europe at
nighttime with electric lights shining in every corner of the region,
presumably powered by Russian gas. Equinor has a similar photo of
Scandinavia, in a section on Safely Exploring in the Barents Sea. In all
three cases, several images show oil rigs, production facilities and
ships surrounded by ice -- from the bird's-eye or "god" perspective. In
Haraway's writing, [god trick is connected to a larger **[dilemma of
objectivity]{.mark}**, which in [feminist understanding]{.mark} is
**[never]{.mark}** completely [possible]{.mark}, as [knowledge is
**always situated**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Such [[**objectivity** and
"knowing all"]{.underline}]{.mark} are also [related to]{.underline}
what Connell and Pearse (2014) write in relation to climate change,
specifically [how "gender research into environmental politics shows
that a [**masculine God-like view** of]{.mark} the [global
problem]{.mark} has merged into [**technocratic**, marketized
'solutions']{.mark} to environmental crisis.]{.underline}" The imagery
of industrial facilities supports justifications based on the
industrialized technological world. The [claims based on industrial
world **represent** and [**reproduce** a **masculine value
system**]{.mark} building on the ability to **control** nature and
harness its resources for a commodity of humans]{.underline}. Laying the
groundwork for ecomodern discourse, claims based on the
industrial-ecological world are substantial. The nature of the
references varies somewhat between the companies. While Gazprom's claims
with respect to technology and the environment are more pragmatic and
linked to direct environmental issues, those of Equinor and Gazprom Neft
[highlight technology as a tool for solving problems stemming from
climate change]{.underline}. Gazprom prioritizes innovative development
and advancement from the technological and organizational standpoints as
the key prerequisites for the efficient and sustainable development of
the oil and gas sector and Russia's fuel and energy complex at large.
(Gazprom, 2019) One of today's most urgent problems---climate
change---is connected to environmental emissions of \[greenhouse
gases\]. Gazprom Neft is doing its bit to address this problem with a
programme to increase the productive use of associated petroleum gas
(APG) produced in oil production as well as concurrently implementing
several major projects in this area. (Gazprom Neft, 2019). It's
supplying the world with energy, creating value for society---and not
least, reducing CO2 emissions from production by up to 90%. The Paris
Agreement is quite clear that the world will still need oil as part of
its energy mix. But which oil is produced, should be produced as cleanly
as possible. (Equinor, 2019) These descriptions draw attention to
technology's role in addressing environmental issues and to the
companies' pioneering role in dealing with environmental problems. [New
projects are justified through their capacity to operate as cleanly as
possible]{.underline}. According to the Norwegian actor, oil needs to be
drilled and Equinor can do it in the best (cleanest and safest) way
possible. [This **framing** of climate change via technological
solutions is an example of the **masculinization** of responses to
climate change, where solutions come from the traditional domain of men
and **hegemonic masculinity**]{.underline} (MacGregor, 2010). In Norway,
and to a certain extent in Russia too, the [discourse regarding the
harmony of economic growth via technology and environmental protection
can also be connected to the discussion on ecomodern
masculinities]{.underline} (Anshelm & Hultman, 2014; Hultman, 2013).

[Another important way in which [scholars can rise]{.mark} to this
challenge is [by **addressing**]{.mark} **our own** [**complicity** in
upholding]{.mark} these [structures]{.mark}]{.underline}, something that
we are rarely prompted to do as scholars of global politics and war. It
is crucial [that a politically conscious, [critical feminism draws
out]{.mark} the 'interconnections with [struggles]{.mark} across the
globe [without **obscuring the privilege** associated with]{.mark} our
social positioning in [the **\[Western\]
academy**]{.mark}]{.underline}**[']{.mark}** (The Santa Cruz Feminists
of Color Collective, 2014, p. 25). Many of the
**[[authors]{.underline}]{.mark}** featured in this book come from or
[**[live in]{.mark}** former **[colonizing powers]{.mark}** and current
settler colonial states]{.underline}, so how does this affect the
possibilities for global solidarity? Simple calls for equality can never
be enough as a feminist political goal, but [[we must always ask]{.mark}
questions [about the contexts within]{.mark} which [grievances]{.mark}
arise [and]{.mark} the [power relations embedded in
them]{.mark}]{.underline}. In their seminal critique of the demand for a
(singular) women's voice in feminism, María C. Lugones and Elizabeth V.
Spelman note [that '**[our visions]{.mark}** of what is better
[are]{.mark} always [informed by our **perception** of]{.mark} what is
bad about our present situation']{.underline} (1983, p. 579). Indeed,
'[how we think and what we think about does depend in large part on who
is there---not to mention [who is]{.mark} expected or [encouraged
to]{.mark} [speak']{.mark} (Lugones & Spelman, 1983, p.
579).]{.underline}

#### All research is situated within structures of power---affirmative knowledge production must be interrogated for its complicity in imperial and colonial epistemologies.

(pg 10) //KKang

While these questions are of concern in any research project, it is
important to remember them specifically in feminist scholarship when it
goes global, given historical and present power relations. Western
feminists in particular need to be aware that 'from the vantage point of
the colonized \[...\] [the term "[research" is]{.mark} inevitably
[linked to European imperialism and colonialism']{.mark}]{.underline}
(Tuhiwai Smith, 2012, p. 1). Knowledge creation about the Other always
involves drawing the Other into our frame; the identification of issues,
actors, and events suits our needs which too often have included the
settling of lands, the management of people(s) and the ruling of the
Other (cf. Said, 1978). [[A]{.mark} good feminist methodological
[discussion in]{.mark} the context of [global politics]{.mark} thus
[must]{.mark} [always]{.mark} also [include]{.mark} [considerations
about whose aims]{.mark} and interests [the research is serving]{.mark}:
[Do we, as]{.mark} privileged [researchers, have something to
offer]{.mark} the communities we are studying [or are we]{.mark} are
[appropriating]{.mark} [Others']{.mark} lives? To what end?]{.underline}
Linda Tuhiwai Smith describes how 'at the common sense level research
was talked about \[among the colonized\] both in terms of its absolute
worthlessness to us, the indigenous world, and its absolute usefulness
to those who wielded it as an instrument' (2012, p. 3). Given these
histories, feminist [[methodological considerations]{.mark},
particularly in the context of global politics, [must]{.mark} always
[include]{.mark} attention to [epistemic violence. Reflexive
practices]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[consider]{.underline}]{.mark} the
limits of knowledge generation in general and [[the researcher's
position as a knowledge producer]{.mark} in particular[, is a crucial
first step]{.mark}]{.underline}. For this volume, authors were thus
asked deeply to interrogate the processes by which they constructed
their findings and their own relation to them. Moreover, each chapter
ends with a reflection on why and how feminist sensibilities mattered in
that process.

### FW\-\--Social Ontology

The term 'gender' has largely displaced the term 'sex' in the English
language (Haig 2004) and is now a given part of our cultural landscape
in Western liberal societies. As such, critical realists are obliged to
take the term seriously despite possibly entertaining misgivings. The
use of the term '[[gender' as a human categorization rather than as a
grammatical part of speech]{.underline}]{.mark} first [[emerged during
the]{.underline}]{.mark} 19[[70s and]{.underline}]{.mark} 19[[80s as
part of social ontology]{.underline}]{.mark}, in parallel with the rise
of both critical realist ideas and the linguistic turn
(poststructuralism and postmodernism). However, as the editors are at
pains to note, poststructuralism and critical realism are not readily
aligned. Nevertheless, although the term 'gender' is ubiquitous, this
does not mean that it has been universally accepted. However, if stated
simplistically[, [there are problems with both the poststructural
position that gender is purely a social construct]{.underline}]{.mark}
(which denies ontology) [[and the positivist position that gender is no
different from sex]{.mark} ([which denies the social, epistemological
aspects of knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline}). Many of the chapters in this
book further explain this issue and call for more analysis and debate.
Nevertheless, to carry out such analysis and debate in the current
climate of identity politics is at one's peril. Stating that 'a
transwoman is still a man' or that 'a lesbian never had a penis' can
result in significant criticism[. [If 'gender' is now part of our social
ontology, then so too is the new authoritarianism and the cyber-mob
mentality of identity politics]{.underline}]{.mark}[,]{.underline}
especially, but not only, on the left. This menace to freedom of
expression is fundamentally at odds with creating a respectful space to
work through the challenges considered in this book.

#### Exploring gendered structures is key to identify basis for struggle and deconstruct the notions of gendered categories.

As many intersectional feminists have pointed out, [understanding the
life of a particular person is not a mechanical matter of 'adding' the
'contents' of the different positions that constitute her.]{.underline}
Theorising is a messy and never clear-cut project, taking place in the
dialectic between the concrete and the abstract, the subjective and the
objective, the speciﬁc and the general, and not the least between the
fundamentally processual character of concrete reality and the
irredeemably static quality of the words and signs which we employ to
understand and explain it. We [can never single out [gender]{.mark}
from]{.underline}, for example, [race and class in any neat and absolute
way]{.underline}, since [these [structures are in constant
transformation and only relatively autonomous from each
other.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Gender]{.underline}]{.mark} is not a
global monolith, but [[must be studied and theorised in all its local
variations]{.underline}]{.mark}. Nevertheless[, it is possible to think
of women as a group on a global level, because [although the gender
structure looks diﬀerent in diﬀerent locations, it possesses so much
internal coherence so as to deserve to be thought of as one
(diﬀerentiated) whole]{.mark}]{.underline}. 9 As Jónasdóttir puts it,
women's commonality has to be thought of as very 'thin' and cannot be
transferred to the empirical level in any direct sense. This thin
[[commonality implies neither a common experience nor a uniﬁed struggle,
but it entails '**a common basis for experience and thus a common basis
for struggle**']{.mark} (]{.underline}1994: 41; emphasis added). The
reason why [[it would be fatal to leave 'women' behind as a feminist
category of analysis]{.underline}]{.mark} is that we need it to denote
women's speciﬁc relation to a gender structure the properties of which
we may only then struggle to deﬁne. [We should]{.underline}, indeed,
[[continue to deconstruct deterministic]{.mark} and essentialist
[notions]{.mark} [of what it means to be man or woman, but such negative
relating to gendered categories can never be exhaustive of feminist
theorising]{.mark}]{.underline}.34 Feminist Theory 12(1)

Alternatively, [Williams argues that the [feminist theory provides a new
perspective to the table by]{.mark} [including gender as a key
element]{.mark} in the analysis. [It suggests viewing IR through gender
lenses]{.mark}.]{.underline} Therefore, feminist IR theories argue that
a "Reconceptualization" of central terms and issues in mainstream IR
like "Power" and "Security" is indispensable[. Relatedly, "Security" as
the main topic in IR neglects the gender dimension. [Fem]{.mark}inist
[IR scholars argue]{.mark} that [the state in conventional IR theories
is a masculine patriarchal entity]{.mark}.2 According to feminists,
"Security" is a national and international issue because women are more
exposed to violence domestically and internationally]{.underline}.3

Thus, Williams [highlights the interconnection between domestic violence
and international violence]{.underline}.4 [She emphasizes [the
connection between women's security and the state's security]{.mark}. In
other words, feminists state that [women are]{.mark} more [susceptible
to]{.mark} attacks, [violence]{.mark}, and rape [during]{.mark} times of
[war. If]{.mark} [gender is excluded]{.mark} and marginalized
[from]{.mark} the beginning of [IR discussions]{.mark}, policymakers
(namely men) will not take it into consideration, and therefore,
[foreign policies would be detrimental to women.5]{.mark}]{.underline}

Moreover, [Williams provides an overview of the feminist critique of the
distinction between "High politics" and "Low politics" put by key
players in IR]{.underline}. Women's issues are often regarded as "low
politics" issues which means that they are secondary or irrelevant to
the discipline[. [Conventional IR theories]{.mark} have a state-centric
approach, and thus, they totally [ignore the role of the
individual]{.mark}.]{.underline} It becomes then almost inconceivable to
introduce social and gender relations into the analysis. [[Omitting
women's experiences]{.mark} [leads to a]{.mark}n insufficient and even
[naïve political analysis]{.mark}.6 Seeing war, for instance, from a
woman's viewpoint can change the conception of war.]{.underline}
Alternatively, together with constructivism, feminism aims to make IR
discipline focus more on the individual and people's experiences[. In
addition, [Williams argues]{.mark} [that women remain excluded from
"hard politics" decision-making positions]{.mark}. Men are more likely
to be appointed in higher status positions, and women continue to be
found in lower-status positions which strengthen the gender hierarchy in
international relations.7]{.underline}

[[Against]{.mark} [essentialist arguments]{.mark} that [see inequality
between women and men as causing violence and]{.mark} [war, and equality
as productive]{.mark} of peace, post-positivist feminists have more
often treated war and gender as co-constituted. [Gender]{.mark} does not
cause war, but it [inhabits war]{.mark}. [Gender is a pervasive]{.mark}
[force, a power relation that defines identities, informs symbolic
orders and directs material processes]{.mark}]{.underline} (Cockburn
2010; Cohn 2012, 3--5; Sjoberg 2013, 2009).[Gender [relations
are]{.mark} imbricated [in processes of]{.mark} [militarization]{.mark},
and [war]{.mark} [reproduces binary gender constructions, militarist
masculinities]{.mark}, and corresponding femininities]{.underline}
(Crane-Seeber 2016; Joachim and Schneiker 2012).Researchers employing
these types of arguments tend to generalize, not by establishing laws,
but by identifying social mechanisms that give force to gendered
processes[. [Two]{.mark} examples of such mechanisms [are]{.mark} first,
the "logic of [masculinist protection]{.mark}" (Young 2003), which calls
on men to defend]{.underline} women and the homeland, making it possible
to think of war as an honorable activity in which to engage; [and
second, the militarization of masculinities, typically
associated]{.underline} with a denigration of women and everything
considered [feminine in order to encourage male war fighting. This
disparagement of women is most virulently]{.underline} expressed in
sexual violence. As men are being trained for war and societies are
being militarized, [violence against women becomes part of the fabric of
everyday lives]{.underline} (Detraz 2012; Duncanson 2009; Whitworth
2007;Goldstein 2003).

#### Ontology first -- it shapes our understanding of the world

**Jenkins et al. '24**. \[\] \"Feminist Metaphysics\", The Stanford
Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2025 Edition), Edward N. Zalta & Uri
Nodelman (eds.),
<https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2025/entries/feminism-metaphysics>

[Whilst there has been work looking at the constitutive social
construction of sex, it may be easier to begin by thinking about this
idea using the example of gender. In the case of gender[, the point
is]{.mark} that gender is [not a classification scheme]{.mark} based
simply on anatomical or biological differences, [but]{.mark} rather
marks social]{.underline} differences between individuals. We can think
of gender in these constitutive terms. [Gender, in this sense at least,
is]{.underline} not about testicles and ovaries, the penis and the
uterus, but [[about a]{.mark} [system of social categories]{.mark},
social practices, social roles, and/or social structures which
constitute what it is to be a member of a given gender]{.underline}
(see, e.g., Haslanger 2012; also Wittig 1992; Delphy 1984; MacKinnon
1989). Consider, for example, the category of landlords. To be a
landlord one must be located within a broad system of social and
economic relations which includes tenants, private property, and the
like. Imagine that, by some coincidence, all and only landlords have a
mole behind their left ear. Even if this were the case, having this
physical mark is not what it is to be a landlord. [What makes one a
landlord is that one holds a certain position in an economic structure,
and plays a roles in certain economic practices by leasing out one's
property.\[4\]]{.underline}

Could sex also be constitutively socially constructed? Certainly it's a
much more controversial claim: whilst an individual's genitalia might be
causally socially constructed (via e.g., gender-affirming surgery) it
seems much harder to argue that (say) vaginas are constituted by social
practices. One strategy that some feminists have adopted here is to
attempt to show that sex as a set of categories is dependent on gender.
[After all, if gender is a set of social practices, and [our norms for
categorising]{.mark} [people]{.mark} into different sexes [is
s]{.mark}omehow [dependent o]{.mark}n or constituted by [gender, then
sex]{.mark} (at least in this sense) [is socially
constructed]{.mark}.]{.underline} Drawing on Monique Wittig, Judith
Butler makes an argument that can be read in this way:

\[Paragraphs ommitted\]

[Social [ontology in feminist thought can be traced to a number of
sources]{.mark}, but [perhaps the most]{.mark} [prominent is Simone de
Beauvoir's claim that "One is not born, but rather becomes,
woman]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Beauvoir 1949/2011, 293). In claiming that
one is not born a woman, Beauvoir was not suggesting that one is never
born with body parts like breasts or ovaries; rather, her concern was
that possession of certain body parts, in and of itself, does not imply
how one could or should be socially situated. In spite of this,
societies (for the most part) reserve for people with vaginas and
breasts certain social roles, norms, and activities that disadvantage
them in relation to those with penises and testes[. [This]{.mark}
[hierarchy of advantage is legitimated]{.mark}, claims de Beauvoir, by
casting the social order as necessary because it is tied to these
apparently natural features of men and women (Beauvoir 1949/2011: Ch.1;
the literature on de Beauvoir interpretation here is also vast: see the
entry on Simone de Beauvoir).]{.underline}

[[This theme]{.mark}---that hierarchies are sustained through myths of
their natural basis, and that their social basis is obscured---[has
prompted a tremendous amount of work on the construction of gender,
race, sexuality and beyond]{.mark}.\[]{.underline}5\] Research in
history, anthropology, literature, and sociology has chronicled the
various mechanisms by which gender and other such categories are
enforced, and research in psychology and biology has further loosened
the ties between body types and social roles. [Having witnessed the
power of naturalizing "myths", feminists tend to be wary of any
suggestion that a category is "natural" or that what's "natural" should
dictate how we organize ourselves socially. By contrast, if it is
recognized, as Beauvoir urged, that what women and men are is at least
partly a social matter, this opens up the possibility that gender roles
could and indeed should be made more equitable through social
change.]{.underline}

As such, [many [feminist metaphysicians have argued that a necessary
part of feminist praxis will involve debunking claims that gender and
other]{.mark} such [categories are i) natural, ii) inevitable, and iii)
without need of justification]{.mark}.]{.underline} (Note that, contrary
to a popular misconception, claiming that something is socially
constructed is not about claiming that that something isn't real[!
Social constructionists broadly tend to be realists about the things
that get socially constructed, though this realism comes in stronger and
weaker forms---see the entry on Social Ontology.) As Ásta puts
it,]{.underline}

[[A paradigm case of]{.mark} such a [debunking project is to reveal a
kind or category as a social category when it is widely held to be a
natural one]{.mark}.]{.underline} The consequences of this are that the
constraints and enablements that come with membership in the kind are
then revealed to need justification; these constraints and enablements
are shown not to be the result of some natural order of things, beyond
the demand for justification. (Ásta 2018, 36).

[[If Ásta is right, then feminist metaphysicians are]{.mark}, at least
in part asserting the constructedness of gender [in order to show that
it is not inevitable that we order our society in the way that we
currently organise things.]{.mark}]{.underline} Once we recognise that
things might be otherwise, we can demand justification for the current
gender order, and, finding such putative justifications of an oppressive
social structure unconvincing, we sow the seeds for political change.

However, [some [feminist metaphysicians have]{.mark} disputed the link
between i) on the one hand, and ii) and iii) on the other. That is, they
have [denied that something being natural implies that it is inevitable
and not in need of justification]{.mark}.]{.underline} As Louise Antony
pointed out, it is uncontroversial that many people are nearsighted
naturally, but we would be simply wrong to suggest that this is
unchangeable: we can, using things like glasses and laser surgery,
alleviate nearsightedness [(Antony 2000, 12). Moreover, given that such
options can be made available, the nearsighted person is well within
their rights to call into question any justification that might be
offered for not giving them access to those options. Applying this
thought directly to the case of gender, the Xenofeminist collective
Laboria Cuboniks put it forcefully: "[If nature is unjust, change
nature!"]{.mark} (Cuboniks 2018, 93).\[6\]]{.underline}

The upshot of this Antony-Cuboniks line of argument is that we don't
need a debunking project in order to undermine the claims that the
current order of things is inevitable and that it is not in need of
justification[. But this leaves us with a question: what is the role
that claims about the social construction of categories like gender are
playing in feminist metaphysics? Sure, they may well be true, but absent
the debunking project, it's unclear what role such construction claims
play in politically engaged metaphysics.]{.underline} One option here is
to argue that "gender is a social construct" is a political slogan, akin
to Audre Lorde's "For the master's tools will never dismantle the
master's house" (Lorde 2017, 91). [Of course, there are lots of ways to
read political slogans, but one such way is as
action-guiding.]{.underline} By employing the slogan "gender is a social
construct", we suggest that gender is to be changed by a particular
group of social mechanisms[. In doing so, we avoid using the wrong
methods for attempting to change gender. The claim that gender is a
social construct, on this account, becomes a claim about the tactics and
strategies that we ought to use in order to disrupt the current gender
order.\[7\]]{.underline}

### FW\-\--Discourse

#### K Representations are a Prior Question before policy

Ronald **Bleiker 2k**, Prof of IR @ Queensland, *Contending Images as
World Politics*, pp. 227-8//jrc

While the conceptual contours of the postmodern will always remain
elusive, the substantial issues that this image of world politics has
brought to the forefront have clear and important implications. Critical
engagements with modernity have emerged from a dissatisfaction with what
Lyotard famously described as a long modern tendency to ground and
legitimize knowledge in reference to a grand narrative, that is, a
universalizing framework which seeks to emancipate the individual by
mastering the conditions of life (Lyotard, 1979, pp. 7-9). [Even
when]{.underline} such [[a]{.underline}]{.mark} master
[[narrative]{.mark} seems **unquestionably desirable**, it [inevitably
legitimizes]{.mark} and objectivizes **certain
[interpretations]{.mark}** and political agendas, thereby [excluding
**everything that does not fit**]{.mark} into its corresponding view of
life.]{.underline} Authors who are said to represent a postmodern image
of the world politics grapple with the implications that emerge from the
prevalence of master narratives in world politics. They challenge the
way in which scientific discourses that have emerged from the Cartesian
separation of the object and subject mask the constituted dimensions of
life. They engage prevalent thinking patterns so that we can see the
world from more that one perspective, and that marginalized voices can
be brought into the realm of dialogue. This search for epistemological
tolerance and inclusion is as much political as it is philosophical. Ant
its practical applicability is -- needless to say -- virtually
unlimited. It is in this sense that, for instance, all feminisms can be
thought of as a postmodern' (Sylvester, 1994, p. 16).

The purpose of this essay is not to summarize the great variety of
postmodern approaches to the world politics. Several authors have
already done so (see for instance, Brown, 1994; Devetak, 1996). The main
effort of this essay thus revolves around demonstrating how something
termed postmodernism may work. From such a perspective [the **'how'** is
as important as the **'is'**.]{.underline} In fact, the 'how' becomes
the 'is' insofar as the nature of something is identified primarily as
the process through which it works. [The prime task]{.underline} of such
an approach [consists]{.underline} not of looking at modernity or
postmodernity as metaphors of contemporary world politics, but [of
understanding]{.underline} -- and acting upon -- [[the]{.mark} more
fundamental [recognition that **all**]{.mark} **forms of [thought are
metaphorical]{.mark}**]{.underline} in nature. They cannot be anything
else, for [language itself is a series of metaphors through which **we
make sense of the world**]{.underline} that surrounds us. And since [we
need language]{.underline} not only to communicate, but also [to form
our **opinions of social phenomena**, [we inevitably]{.mark} think, live
and [politicize through]{.mark} a **series of
[metaphors]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- that is, [[through]{.mark} forms of
[conceptualizing that contain]{.mark} **inevitable [gaps]{.mark}**
between]{.underline} a [representation]{.underline} of an event [and the
event itself]{.underline}.

Various implications follow from an approach that acknowledges the
metaphorical nature of our understanding of world politics. At the
beginning is perhaps the simple recognition that representation is an
essential aspect of the political process. [[Political
reality]{.underline}]{.mark}, F.R. Ankersmit stresses, ['[is' not first
given to us and subsequently represented; **political**]{.mark}
**[reality]{.mark}** [only comes into being after and **due to
representations'**]{.mark}]{.underline} (1996, pg. 47). What this means
for an analysis of world politics is that [[before being able to
move]{.mark} it [to **any other in question**, one has to deal]{.mark}
with [how the **representation has structured the
object**]{.mark}]{.underline} it seeks to represent.

[Discourse analysis is more widely located within or associated with the
field of poststructuralism. While there is some discussion over
'discourse analysis' as a methodology]{.underline} (see for instance
Schiffrin, Tannen, & Hamilton, 2008), this chapter takes the approach
that it is indeed a method informed by the epistemological positioning
of poststructural feminism. Poststructuralism's ontological starting
point is anti- or non-foundationalist; this means [[the material world
is not]{.mark} necessarily rationally and [objectively independent of
our conceptualization]{.mark} of it because we mediate reality through
our interpretations and emphases]{.underline}. Discourse is the mode of
interpretation; therefore, 'discourse ... does not employ "an epistemic
realism, whereby the world comprises material objects"'. Instead it
examines the political 24 Caron E. Gentry impact of 'adopting one mode
of representation over another' (Milliken, 1999, pp. 225--226).
[Scholars use discourse analysis to 'illustrate how ... [textual
and]{.mark} [social processes are intrinsically connected]{.mark} and
[to]{.mark} describe, in [specific contexts]{.mark}, the implications of
this connection for [the way we think and act in the]{.mark}
contemporary [world']{.mark}]{.underline} (George, 1994, p. 191 as cited
in Milliken, 1999, p. 225). Therefore, what [counts as [knowledge and
what is seen as important]{.mark} to knowledge, [is constructed]{.mark}
and imbued [with power]{.mark}]{.underline}. Adopting a Foucauldian1

[Russians]{.mark} have a historical [view]{.mark} of [Chechens as

[justify]{.mark} intervention and military action in the past, it is not
such a significant leap to view Chechens as ruthless terrorists to
justify [further military action]{.mark} in the region.]{.underline}
Alternatively, Chechen construction of self as honourable justice
seekers also feeds into their violent resistance to Russian military
interference.

**Plumwood 02** Val Plumwood Australian Research Council Fellow @ Sydney
'2 Environmental Culture p. 127

Dobson and Norton both express concern over the unnecessary divisiveness
they think the critique of anthropocentrism engenders. There are some
valid points in their critique of the deep/shallow division and
especially the \'failure of ecophilosophy to make itself practical\'
which I take up below. However, division among environmentalists is not
necessarily as destructive or undesirable as Norton assumes. Some (if
not all) of what is involved in the worry about the division between the
deep and shallow approaches is an authentic, if sometimes unfortunate
and debilitating, problem about framework challenges which is by no
means peculiar to the environment movement. [[Any
movement]{.underline}]{.mark} (feminism is a good example) [involved in
forms of social change [which try to challenge]{.mark} major, entrenched
cultural [norms finds itself in a **conflict of choice**
between]{.mark}]{.underline}, on the one hand, [[moderate
strategies]{.mark} aiming for \'success\' in terms of
immediately]{.underline} achievable political [changes [within the
**framework** and]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}on the other, [radical
strategies of mounting more difficult, long-term and extensive forms of
cultural [challenge to **framework norms**. **To insist on unity is to
support the status quo and defeat the dynamic of**]{.mark} **change and
[challenge]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[While the]{.underline} level of [conflict between framework and
non-framework challenges]{.underline} (\'shallow\' and \'deep\') [can
often be]{.underline} augmented or [reduced]{.underline} by various
theoretical and practical strategies, **[it cannot]{.underline}** simply
**[be wished away by reconceiving the difference in terms of \'two
tasks\', different but in no way conflicting]{.underline}**. 5 [**The
conflict is real to the extent that a framework challenge is needed**,
and]{.underline} to the extent that [conventional [political
work]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}for change in a given society
**[[demands conformity to the problematic
framework]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Although serious splits and Othering
hinder the interchange process, [the search for
[\'unity\']{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}among environmentalists [on
terms which deny either side of this dilemma [is]{.mark} **seriously
[misguided. The conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}certainly
[**[cannot be]{.underline}**]{.mark} adequately [**[resolved by
abandoning the more strenuous]{.mark} and challenging forms of
[framework critique]{.mark} and the conceptual tools associated with
them, on the grounds that they prevent unity and make moderates
uncomfortable**, especially in the corridors of power]{.underline}. As
many social movements have shown, movement vigour and long-term
effectiveness depend not so much on unity as on an appropriate tension
and dynamic interchange between moderate and radical elements to enable
mutual goal maintenance and redefinition; loss of either vigour or
vision results when either party vanquishes the other, or when
productive interchange ceases. And **[[framework challenges and
conflicts are the very place where philosophy most clearly show its
practical value]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Recently, I was asked to write a response to Mike Desch's argument that
high-tech methodology hurts the policy relevance of Security Studies for
Perspectives on Politics. The **[[policy]{.underline}]{.mark}**
relevance that Desch *[is interested in]{.mark}* is *[relevance
to]{.mark}* **[the [Washington]{.mark} establishment]{.underline}** in
the US. There's nothing ground-breaking about my response -- it repeats
things feminists have been saying for decades. It suggests that *seeing
the US government as the location of relevance may be not only wrong but
morally insidious*, then makes the argument that *[the notion of
objective knowledge]{.mark} and scientific process* that Desch shares
with the quantitative work he criticizes *[might be the root of]{.mark}*
a differently understood 'relevance problem' for Security Studies --
[**[hierarchy]{.underline}** *and* **[exclusion]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
Even though this response is, in my view, strikingly unoriginal -- it
seems to be getting the same reaction it got 20 years ago. Desch was
able to write a response to the response -- well, a response to other
people's responses anyway. All of the other pieces (including the other
two in the sentence below) are addressed substantively. My piece is
mentioned in one sentence. Brace yourself. "Finally, Tutton, Voeten, and
Laura Sjoberg all make an important point about policy-relevance
involving much more than government policy-makers." Yep. That's it. I
say: *gender analysis shows your conception* of Security Studies *is*
**[normatively harmful]{.underline}** *and* **[[intellectually
counterproductive]{.underline}]{.mark}**. He says: oh, nice of you to
tell me that we need to pay attention to policy-making outside of
government. I meant that, I just didn't say it. But my catch-all point
applies to that. In other words, I know there's stuff I didn't talk
about, and that's enough to dispense with the gender critique. My
colleagues from outside of the United States often wonder why I engage
with the American mainstream of IR, and, when I first read Desch's
response to the response, I'll admit, I got on the skeptical bandwagon.
But then I thought -- that response is exactly why it has to keep
getting said. There, and then here, and then anyplace else that it can
be. **[[Gender analysis is]{.mark} not just something you mean but don't

#### Locating violence at the institutional level abdicates individual responsibility, and is a conscious decision to participate in that violence

Susanne **Kappeler '95**, a lecturer in English at the U. of East Anglia
and an associate professor at the School of Humanities and Social
Sciences @ Al Akhawayn U., The Will To Violence: The Politics of
Personal Behavior, pg 8-11//jrc

Moreover, personal behaviour is no alternative to \`political\' action;
there is no question of either/or. My concern, on the contrary, is the
connection between these recognized forms of violence and the forms of
everyday behaviour which we consider \`normal\' but which betray our own
will to violence - the connection, in other words, between our own
actions and those acts of violence which are normally the focus of our
political critiques. Precisely [because there is no choice between
[dedicating oneself]{.mark} either [to \`political issues\' or]{.mark}
to \`[personal behaviour\']{.mark}, the question of [the politics of
personal behaviour has]{.mark} (also) [to be moved into the centre of
our politics and]{.mark} our [critique]{.mark}. Violence]{.underline} -
what we usually recognize as such - [is [no exception to the
rules]{.mark}]{.underline}, no deviation from the normal and nothing out
of the ordinary, [in a society in which exploitation and oppression are
the norm, the ordinary and the rule.]{.underline} It is no misbehaviour
of a minority amid good behaviour by the majority, nor the deeds of
inhuman monsters amid humane humans, in a society in which there is no
equality, in which people divide others according to race, class, sex
and many other factors in order to rule, exploit, use, objectify,
enslave, sell, torture and kill them, in which millions of animals are
tortured, genetically manipulated, enslaved and slaughtered daily for
\`harmless\' consumption by humans. It is no error of judgement, no
moral lapse and no transgression against the customs of a culture which
is thoroughly steeped in the values of profit and desire, of
self-realization, expansion and progress. [Violence as we usually
perceive it is \`simply\' a specific - and to us still visible - form of
violence, the consistent and logical application of the principles of
our culture and everyday life.]{.underline} War does not suddenly break
out in a peaceful society; sexual violence is not the disturbance of
otherwise equal gender relations. Racist attacks do not shoot like
lightning out of a non-racist sky, and the sexual exploitation of
children is no solitary problem in a world otherwise just to children.
[[The violence of our most commonsense everyday thinking]{.mark}, and
[especially our personal will to violence]{.mark}, constitute the
conceptual preparation, the ideological armament and the intellectual
mobilization which make]{.underline} the \`outbreak\' of war, of sexual
violence, of racist attacks, of murder and [destruction possible at all.
**[\'We are the war\']{.mark}**,]{.underline} writes Slavenka Drakulic
at the end of her existential analysis of the question, \`what is
war?\': I do not know what war is, I want to tell \[my friend\], but I
see it everywhere. It is in the blood-soaked street in Sarajevo, after
20 people have been killed while they queued for bread. But it is also
in your non-comprehension, in my unconscious cruelty towards you, in the
fact that you have a yellow form \[for refugees\] and I don\'t, in the
way in which it grows inside ourselves and changes our feelings,
relationships, values - in short: us. We are the war \... And I am
afraid that we cannot hold anyone else responsible[. [We make this war
possible, we permit it to happen]{.underline}]{.mark}[.\' \`We are the
war\']{.underline} - and we also \`are\' the sexual violence, the racist
violence, the exploitation and the will to violence in all its
manifestations in a society in so-called \`peacetime\', for [[we make
them possible and we permit them to happen.]{.mark} \`We are the war\'
does not mean that the responsibility for a war is shared collectively
and diffusely by an entire society]{.underline} - which would be
equivalent to exonerating warlords and politicians and profiteers or, as
Ulrich Beck says, upholding the notion of \`collective
irresponsibility\', where people are no longer held responsible for
their actions, and where the conception of universal responsibility
becomes the equivalent of a universal acquittal.\' On the contrary, the
object is precisely to analyse the specific and differential
responsibility of everyone in their diverse situations. [[Decisions to
unleash a war are indeed taken at particular levels of power]{.mark} by
those in a position to make them and to command such collective action.
[We need to hold them clearly responsible for their
decisions]{.mark}]{.underline} and actions without lessening theirs by
any collective \`assumption\' of responsibility. Yet our habit of
focusing on the stage where the major dramas of power take place tends
to obscure our sight in relation to our own sphere of competence, our
own power and our own responsibility - [[leading to the]{.mark}
well-known [illusion of our apparent]{.mark} \`powerlessness\' and its
accompanying phenomenon, [our so-called political
disillusionment]{.mark}.]{.underline} Single citizens - even more so
those of other nations - have come to feel secure in their obvious
non-responsibility for such large-scale political events as, say, the
wars in Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina or Somalia - since the decisions
for such events are always made elsewhere. Yet [[our insight that indeed
we are not responsible for]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[decisions]{.underline}]{.mark} of a Serbian general or a Croatian
president [[tends to mislead us into thinking that therefore we have no
responsibility at all]{.mark}, [not even for forming our own
judgement]{.mark}, [and thus into underrating the responsibility we do
have within our own sphere of action]{.mark}. In particular, it seems to
absolve us from having to try to see any relation between our own
actions and those events, or to recognize the connections between those
political decisions and our own personal decisions. It not only shows
that [we]{.mark} [participate in]{.mark}]{.underline} what Beck calls
[\`[organized irresponsibility\', upholding the apparent lack of
connection between]{.mark} bureaucratically, institutionally,
[nationally and also individually organized separate
competences]{.mark}. It also proves the phenomenal and unquestioned
alliance of our personal thinking with the thinking of the major
powermongers. For we tend to think that we cannot \`do\' anything, say,
about a war, because we deem ourselves to be in the wrong situation;
because we are not where the major decisions are made.]{.underline}
Which is why many of those not yet entirely disillusioned with politics
tend to engage in a form of mental deputy politics, in the style of
\`What would I do if I were the general, the prime minister, the
president, the foreign minister or the minister of defence?\' Since we
seem to regard their mega spheres of action as the only worthwhile and
truly effective ones, and since our political analyses tend to dwell
there first of all, any question of what I would do if I were indeed
myself tends to peter out in the comparative insignificance of having
what is perceived as \`virtually no possibilities\': what I could do
seems petty and futile. For my own action I obviously desire the range
of action of a general, a prime minister, or a General Secretary of the
UN - finding expression in ever more prevalent formulations like \`I
want to stop this war\', \`I want military intervention\', \`I want to
stop this backlash\', or \`I want a moral revolution.\' 7 , We are this
war\', however, even if we do not command the troops or participate in
so-called peace talks, namely as Drakulic says, in our
\'non-comprehension\': our willed refusal to feel responsible for our
own thinking and for working out our own understanding, preferring
innocently to drift along the ideological current of prefabricated
arguments or less than innocently taking advantage of the advantages
these offer. And we \`are\' the war in our \`unconscious cruelty towards
you\', our tolerance of the \`fact that you have a yellow form for
refugees and I don\'t\' - our readiness, in other words, to build
identities, one for ourselves and one for refugees, one of our own and
one for the \`others\'. [[We]{.mark} [share in the responsibility
for]{.mark}]{.underline} this [[war and its violence in the way we let
them grow inside]{.mark} [us]{.mark}, that is, [in the way we
shape]{.mark} \`[our feelings, our relationships, our values\' according
to the structures and the values of war and violence]{.mark}. So [if we
move beyond the usual frame of violence]{.mark}, towards the structures
of thought employed in decisions to act, [this]{.mark} also **[means
making an analysis of action]{.mark}**. This seems all the more urgent
as action seems barely to be perceived any longer. [There is talk of the
government doing \`nothing]{.mark}\', [of its \`inaction\', of the need
for action]{.mark}, the time for action, the need for strategies, our
inability to act as well as our desire to become \`active\' again.
[We]{.mark} seem to [deem ourselves in a]{.mark} kind of [action
vacuum]{.mark} which, like the cosmic black hole, tends to consume any
renewed effort only to increase its size. Hence [this is]{.mark} also
a[n attempt to shift the focus]{.mark} again to the fact that we are
continually acting and doing, and that [there is no such thing as not
acting or doing nothing]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Structural Analysis of violence that does not attend to one's role in the violence causes greater domination and suffering. 

Jayan **Nayar** '99 , U. of Warwick School of Law, "RE-FRAMING
INTERNATIONAL LAW FOR THE 21ST CENTURY", 9 Transnat\'l L. & Contemp.
Probs. 599, Fall of 1999//jrc

My questioning is not of intent, or of commitment, or of the sincerity
of those who advocate world-order transformations. Rather, [my
questionings relate to a perspective on \"implications.\" Here, [there
is a very different]{.mark},]{.underline} and more subtle, sort of
globalized [[world-order]{.underline}]{.mark} that we need to
consider\--[[the globalization of violence,]{.mark} wherein [human
relationships become disconnected from the personal and]{.mark} are
instead [conjoined into ]{.mark}]{.underline}distant and [[distanced
chains of violence,]{.mark} an [alienation of human and human]{.mark}.
And [by the nature of this new world-ordering]{.mark}, as the web of
implication in **[relational violence is increasingly
extended]{.mark}**, so too, [the vision of violence itself becomes
blurred]{.mark} and the voice, muted. Through this implication into
violence, therefore, [the order(ing) of emancipatory imagination is
reinforced. What we cannot see]{.mark}, after all, we cannot speak; what
[we refuse to see]{.mark}, we dare not speak.]{.underline}\
[So]{.underline}, back to the question: to what extent, for this, \"our
world,\" [[do we contemplate change when \"we\" imagine transformed
\"world-orders]{.underline}]{.mark}?\" In addition to the familiar
culprits of violent orderings, such as government, financial
institutions, transnational corporations, the World Bank, the IMF, and
the WTO (as significant culprits they indeed are), do we, in our
contemplations of violent orders, vision our locations within corporate
\"educational\" institutions as \"professional academics\" and
\"researchers,\" our locations within corporate NGOs as \"professional
activists,\" our locations within \"think-tanks\" and \"research
organizations\" as \"professional policy-formulators,\" and whatever
other locations of elite \"expertise\" we have been \"trained\" to
possess, as ordered sites, complicit and parasitic, within a violent
\"world-order\"? [[Do we see in our critiques of
world-orderings,]{.mark} out there, [the orderings we find, right here,
in our bodies, minds, relationships, expectations, fears and
hopes]{.mark}?]{.underline} [Would we be willing to see \"our (ordered)
world\" dismantled in order that other worlds, wherein our
\"privileges\" become extinguished, may flourish?]{.underline} These
concerns are, then, I believe, the real complexities of judgment and
action. [[Consideration should be given]{.mark}, not only to those of
the political-structural, so often honed in on, but also [to
the]{.mark}]{.underline}  \[\*628\] [[issue of the
political-personal]{.mark}, which [ultimately]{.mark} is [the \"unit\"
of \"worlds]{.mark}\" and of \"orders.\" [If]{.mark}
\"[globalization]{.mark},\" as a recent obsession of intellectual minds,
[has contributed]{.mark} [anything]{.mark} to an understanding of the
ways of the \"world,\"]{.underline} I suggest, [[it is that we cannot
escape \"our\" implication within the violence of \"world
(mis)orders.\"]{.underline}]{.mark}

### XTN -- Institutional vs Behavior 

#### The affirmative's concept of violence as external from their own lives allows individuals to [abdicate]{.underline} their responsibility. Denial of our [individual culpability]{.underline} with violence forecloses the possibility of [meaningful change]{.underline}\-\--in the process, violence becomes more likely. 

Susanne **Kappeler 95**, lecturer in English at the University of East
Anglia and an associate professor at the School of Humanities and Social
Sciences, Al Akhawayn University, "The Will To Violence: The Politics of
Personal Behavior," p. 1-4

What is striking is that the [violence]{.underline} which is talked
about [is always the violence committed by **someone
else**]{.underline}: women talk about the violence of men, adults about
the violence of young people; the left, liberals and the centre about
the violence of right extremists; the right, centre and liberals about
the violence of leftist extremists; [**political [activists]{.mark}**
[talk about **structural violence**]{.mark}]{.underline}, police and
politicians about violence in the \`street\', [[and]{.mark} all together
about [the violence in our society]{.mark}]{.underline}. Similarly,
Westerners talk about violence in the Balkans, Western citizens together
with their generals about the violence of the Serbian army. [[Violence
is **recognized** and **measured** by its **visible effects**]{.mark},
the spectacular **blood** of **wounded bodies**, the **material
destruction** of objects, the **visible damage** left in the world of
'objects'. [In its]{.mark} **measurable [damage]{.mark}** [we see the
**proof** that violence has taken place]{.mark}, the violence being
reduced to this damage. [The violation as such]{.mark}, or **invisible
forms of violence**]{.underline} - the non-physical violence of threat
and terror, of insult and humiliation, the violation of human dignity -
[[are **hardly ever the issue**]{.underline}]{.mark} except to some
extent in feminist and anti-racist analyses, or under the name of
psychological violence. Here violence is recognized by the victims and
defined from their perspective - an important step away from the
catalogue of violent acts and the exclusive evidence of material traces
in the object. Yet even here the focus tends to be on the effects and
experience of violence, either the objective and scientific measure of
psychological damage, or the increasingly subjective definition of
violence as experience. [[Violence]{.mark} is [perceived as a
**phenomenon for science** to research]{.mark} and for politics **to get
a grip on**. But [violence is not a phenomenon]{.mark}: it is [the
behaviour of people]{.mark}, human [action which may be
analysed.]{.mark} What is missing is an **analysis of violence as
action** - not just as acts of violence, or the cause of its effects,
but as the **actions of people** in relation to **other people and
beings** or things.]{.underline} Feminist critique, as well as other
political critiques, has analysed the preconditions of violence, the
unequal power relations which enable it to take place. However, under
the pressure of mainstream science and a sociological perspective which
increasingly dominates our thinking, it is becoming standard to argue as
if it were these power relations which cause the violence. [Underlying
is a]{.underline} behaviourist [model which prefers to see human action
as the **exclusive product** of **circumstances**, ignoring the personal
decision of the agent to act, implying in turn that circumstances
virtually dictate **certain forms of behaviour**. Even though we would
probably not underwrite these propositions in their **crass form**,
there is nevertheless a **growing tendency**, not just in social
science, to explain **violent behaviour** by its
**circumstances**]{.underline}. (Compare the question, \`Does
pornography cause violence?\') The circumstances identified may differ
according to the politics of the explainers, but the method of
explanation remains the same. While consideration of mitigating
circumstances has its rightful place in a court of law trying (and
defending) an offender, this does not automatically make it an adequate
or sufficient practice for political analysis. It begs the question, in
particular, \`What is considered to be part of the circumstances (and by
whom)?\' Thus in the case of sexual offenders, there is a routine
search - on the part of the tabloid press or professionals of violence -
for experiences of violence in the offender\'s own past, an
understanding which is rapidly solidifying in scientific model of a
\`cycle of violence\'. That is, the relevant factors are sought in the
distant past and in other contexts of action, e a crucial factor in the
present context is ignored, namely the agent\'s decision to act as he
did. Even politically oppositional groups are not immune to this
mainstream sociologizing. Some left groups have tried to explain men\'s
sexual violence as the result of class oppression, while some Black
theoreticians have explained the violence of Black men as the result of
racist oppression. [[The]{.mark} **ostensible [aim]{.mark}** [of these
arguments may be to draw attention to]{.mark} the [**pervasive** and
**structural violence**]{.mark}]{.underline} of classism and racism,
[[yet they not only fail to **combat** such **inequality**, **they
actively contribute to it**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Although such
oppression is a very real part of an agent\'s life context, [these
'[explanations' **ignore**]{.mark} the fact [that not everyone
experiencing the **same oppression** uses violence]{.mark}, that is,
that [these **circumstances** do not 'cause' **violent behaviour**. They
overlook]{.mark}, in other words, [that the **perpetrator has decided to
violate**]{.mark}, even if this decision was made in circumstances of
limited choice. To overlook this decision, however, is itself a
**political decision**]{.underline}, serving particular interests. In
the first instance [[it serves to **exonerate the
perpetrators**]{.mark}, whose responsibility is thus [transferred to
**circumstances** and a **history** for which other
people]{.mark}]{.underline} (who remain beyond reach) [[are
responsible]{.mark}.]{.underline} Moreover, [it [helps to **stigmatize**
all those living in]{.mark}]{.underline} poverty and
[**[oppression]{.mark}**; because they are obvious victims of violence
and oppression, they are held to be potential perpetrators themselves.\'
This slanders all]{.underline} the women [who]{.underline} have
[experienced]{.underline} sexual [violence, yet do not use violence
against others]{.underline}, and libels those experiencing racist and
class oppression, yet do not necessarily act out violence. Far from
supporting those oppressed by classist, racist or sexist oppression, it
sells out these entire groups in the interest of exonerating individual
members. It is a version of collective victim-blaming, of stigmatizing
entire social strata as potential hotbeds of violence, which rests on
and perpetuates the mainstream division of society into so-called
marginal groups - the classic clienteles of social work and care
politics (and of police repression) - and an implied \`centre\' to which
all the speakers, explainers, researchers and careers themselves belong,
and which we are to assume to be a zone of non-violence. [Explaining
people\'s **violent behaviour** by their circumstances also has the
advantage of implying that the '**solution**' lies in a change to
circumstances.]{.underline} Thus it has become fashionable among
socially minded politicians and intellectuals in Germany to argue that
the rising neo-Nazi violence of young people (men), especially in former
East Germany, needs to be countered by combating poverty and
unemployment in these areas. Likewise anti-racist groups like the Anti.
Racist Alliance or the Anti-Nazi League in Britain argue that \`the
causes of racism, like poverty and unemployment, should be tackled and
that it is \`problems like unemployment and bad housing which lead to
racism\'.\' Besides being no explanation at all of why (white poverty
and unemployment should lead specifically to racist violence (and what
would explain middle- and upper-class racism), [[it is **more than
questionable** to combat]{.mark}]{.underline} poverty only (but
precisely) when and where violence is exercised. It not only legitimates
the violence (by \`explaining\' it), but constitutes an incentive to
violence, confirming that [[social problems]{.underline}]{.mark} will be
taken seriously [[when and where 'they attract attention by **means of
violence**]{.underline}]{.mark} - just as the most unruly children in
schools (mostly boys) tend to get more attention from teachers than
well-behaved and quiet children (mostly girls). Thus if German neo-Nazi
youths and youth groups, since their murderous assaults on refugees and
migrants in Hoyerswerda, Rostock, Dresden etc., are treated to special
youth projects and social care measures (to the tune of DM 20 million
per year), including \`educative\' trips to Morocco and Israel,\' this
is am unmistakable signal to society that racist violence does indeed
\'pay off\'.

### 2NC\-\--L\-\--Arctic Security

#### Every component of their Arctic impact is a masculine fantasy, projected by conservatives who assert indefensible assumptions about space, state behavior, and the possibility of stable control\-\--the [image]{.underline} of instability provokes an [affective]{.underline} response that recenters the [most extreme]{.underline} and [destructive]{.underline} forms of militarism

[[The idea of the Arctic as]{.mark} an open]{.underline} e or opening e
[and [uncertain]{.mark} space]{.underline} also [[calls forth]{.mark}
future-oriented imaginative techniques]{.underline}, notably scenario
analysis and the booming trade in "Arctic futures" (Anderson, 2010).
[The rhetorical orientation of such exercises inevitably reproduces and
gives free rein to divergent conceptualizations of the
future]{.underline}. Thus, [on]{.underline} the [one hand are [dystopian
imaginations]{.mark} of the Arctic [as a locus of]{.mark} social,
**political, economic, cultural and ecological**
[disaster]{.mark}]{.underline}. While during the 1990s Arctic space was
infused with political idealism and hope as the end of the Cold War
seemed to open the possibility of a less explicitly territorialized
governance regime (the Arctic Council), [current interventions in Arctic
space raise the spectres of conﬂict, environmental degradation and the
"resource curse"]{.underline} (Emmerson, 2010). [[The notion of]{.mark}
the Arctic as [a]{.mark}n open, [**'melting space'** is]{.mark} thus
[represented as]{.mark} posing [a]{.mark} **multi-faceted
[security]{.mark}** [risk]{.mark}]{.underline}. Scott
[Borgerson]{.underline} (2008) [published a]{.underline} notably
[neo-realist intervention in Foreign Affairs which considered this kind
of scenario in more detail; he argued that the decrease in sea
ice]{.underline} cover [is directly correlated to evidence of a new
'scramble for resources']{.underline} in the region, involving the ﬁve
Arctic Ocean coastal states and their national security interests.
According to Borgerson (2008: 65), **[[the Arctic]{.mark} "region [could
erupt in an armed]{.mark} mad [dash for]{.mark} its
[resources"]{.mark}]{.underline}**. More generally, [melting ice is
correlated with enhanced accessibility and hence opportunities for new
actors]{.underline} ranging from commercial shipping to illegal migrants
and terrorist groups [to migrate]{.underline} within and beyond the
Arctic. At the most extreme, [neorealists have contended that Arctic
installations such as pipelines or terminals might be potential targets
for terrorist organizations]{.underline} hell-bent on undermining North
American energy security (Byers, 2009). At the same time, [the Arctic is
also framed as a space of promise]{.underline}: the locus of a potential
oil bonanza, new strategic trade routes and huge ﬁshing grounds (Powell,
2008a). No wonder then that the [Arctic possibilities have resulted in a
number of scenarios on the relationship between Arctic resources and
Arctic geopolitical order.]{.underline} Lawson [Brigham]{.underline}, a
well known Arctic expert, [has imagined an "Arctic race", a scenario in
which "high demand and unstable governance set the stage for a 'no holds
barred' rush for Arctic wealth and resources]{.underline}" (described in
Bennett, 2010, n.p.). This vision, which is [opposite to "Arctic
saga]{.underline}", can be regarded as a liberal warning message.
Accordingly, without new governance structures based on new
international agreements, [high demand in the Arctic region could lead
to political chaos which could also jeopardize Arctic ecosystems and
cultures]{.underline}. The emphasis on the economic potential of the
Arctic maritime areas further highlights the dominance of future over
present in contemporary geopolitical discourses. **[[The image of
disaster]{.underline}]{.mark}** (as epitomised by the Exxon Valdez
sinking in 1989) [thus [forms a counterpoint to the image of]{.mark} a
[treasure chest]{.mark}]{.underline} (the Russian ﬂagplanting in
2007).We suggest that [[these assertions]{.mark} of Arctic **disaster**
are **used to [justify]{.mark} a [strengthened military
presence]{.mark}** in Arctic waters [in the name of]{.mark} national
[security]{.mark} along with a range of futuristic
possibilities]{.underline} (Jensen & Rottem, 2009). Here
[[**neo-realism** feeds off the idea of the Arctic as]{.mark} opening,
shifting and potentially [**chaotic space**. It]{.mark} thus [has an
**affective**]{.mark} as well as descriptive [quality invoking a]{.mark}
mood change and associated ["call]{.mark}s [to
arms"]{.mark}]{.underline} (Dodds, 2010). This theme of '[fearing the
future' has emerged periodically within]{.underline} Canadian [political
discourse, with]{.underline} Stephen Harper's famous "[use it or lose
it" dictum]{.underline} traceable through previous governments, which
have emphasized the threat of incursion by the Soviets or the United
States (Dodds, in press; Head, 1963; Huebert, 2003). [The disaster
argumentation]{.underline} (Berkman & Young, 2009) [also underwrites
liberal calls for a new multilateral Arctic legal agreement]{.underline}
which would set out rules, for example, on how to exploit Arctic
resources. [In these representations, "multilateralism" denotes peace,
prosperity, stability and environmental rescue whilst national control
and interest denote increasing tension, environmental degradation and
conﬂict. Arctic 'openness' is **central to the performance** of Arctic
geopolitics]{.underline}, enabling sabre-rattling by the ﬁve Arctic
Ocean coastal states. [The region's **[coding as a]{.mark} [feminine
space to be tamed by masculine exploits]{.mark} [provides an arena for
national magniﬁcation]{.mark}**. The remoteness and difﬁculty of
maintaining permanent occupation]{.underline} of the far north also
[makes it a space where overlapping territorial claims and competing
understandings of access to transit passages can]{.underline} (at the
moment) [co-exist with relatively little chance of actual
combat]{.underline} (Baev, 2007). As we shall see, this is particularly
true of the US/Canadian arguments over the legal status of the NorthWest
Passage. In this way [the [discursive formation]{.mark} of Arctic
geopolitics [is]{.mark} also [bound up with]{.mark} neo-realist [ideas
about]{.mark} the [inherent tendencies]{.mark} of 'states' [towards
'conﬂict' over 'resources']{.mark}, 'sovereignty' and so on
e]{.underline} [ideas [that have been subject to **extensive critical
deconstruction**]{.mark} in IR and political geography, [but which
are]{.mark} being rapidly [reassembled]{.mark} in relation to the
Arctic. [The Arctic is]{.mark} thus [a space in which]{.mark} the
**[foundational myths of orthodox i]{.mark}nternational
[r]{.mark}elations [are]{.mark} being
[reasserted]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It might be said that it is not just
the Arctic climate that is changing, with knock on effects for state
politics and international relations, but rather that the region is
being reconstituted within a discursive formation that renders it
amenable to neo-realist understandings and practices inconceivable for
other, more inhabited regions. [[Accepting]{.mark} the [premises
of]{.mark} 'Arctic [geopolitics' risks]{.mark} both obscuring the
liveliness of Arctic geography]{.underline} (Vannini, Baldacchino, Guay,
Royle, & Steinberg, 2009) [and [**enabling the sovereign fantasy**
that]{.mark}]{.underline} coastal states and their civilian and
[[military representatives]{.mark} have [previously enjoyed security via
effective]{.mark} territorial [control]{.mark} and may establish it once
again]{.underline}.

Even a brief examination of the competing narratives of security in and
for the region suggests that [[there is **no consensus** about what
constitutes 'Arctic security]{.mark}']{.underline} and its attendant
practices. [[Conventional analyses employ a **militarized lens**
reminiscent of the Cold War,]{.mark} or an updated focus upon
unconventional threats to state sovereignt]{.underline}y transmitted
through the Arctic, such as terrorism, drug trafficking, and illegal
migration. [Other commentators view Arctic security as inherently linked
to]{.underline} the environmental and human security implications of
[climate change]{.underline} for the people (particularly indigenous
peoples) who inhabit the circumpolar North. Still others link Arctic
security to domestic or continental energy security, and the development
of large-scale hydrocarbon resources in the comparatively stable
neighbourhood of the Euro-American Arctic region. In short[, 'Arctic
[security' remains **fundamentally contested**]{.mark}. These [competing
conceptualizations]{.mark} of security [can be understood not as
objective]{.mark} analyses of conditions of (in)security in the Arctic,
[but as efforts to]{.mark} securitize -- to [raise to the
**extra-political level** of 'security threat']{.mark} -- issues that
affect the interests of particular actors. Regardless of their accuracy
or normativity, these [representations]{.mark} of Arctic security
[constitute speech acts, or 'securitizing moves,']{.mark}]{.underline}
attempting to designate particular phenomena as threats requiring
emergency measures and superordinate status within relevant policy
discussions. [Given the discursive power of security logic, and the
extra-political authority that accrues to governments whenever states of
emergency are invoked and issues successfully 'securitized,' the
struggle to define (in)security in the Arctic is central to the region's
future]{.underline}.This paper investigates how Arctic security is
understood by people who live in the region. How have indigenous actors
conceptualized Arctic security in the Canadian North? What explains the
failure of indigenous efforts to securitize Arctic climate change? It
undertakes textual analysis of indigenous securitizing moves in the
Arctic through the publicly available online documents of four actors:
the three Permanent Participants of the Arctic Council representing
Canadian indigenous peoples (Arctic Athabaskan Council, Gwich'in Council
International, and the Inuit Circumpolar Council), and the national
Inuit organization in Canada, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (ITK). The paper
a) lays out a revised securitization framework for understanding
security claims; b) maps how Arctic security has been articulated by
these indigenous actors in the Canadian North; and c) applies the
revised securitization theory to partially explain the failure of
indigenous efforts to securitize Arctic climate change. The findings
suggests that the Page \| 3 traditional indigenous concern over
'cultural security' driven by modernization and Southern Canadian
influence is giving way to a central security concern over climate
change as the greatest threat to traditional indigenous ways of life.
The paper further hypothesizes that indigenous securitization claims,
especially as related to climate change, are particularly susceptible to
failed or unsuccessful securitization because of the 'insecurity of
non-dominance' that discursively and practically constructs indigenous
Canadians outside the scope of acceptable securitizing actors in Canada.
The findings provide some insight into securitization processes in
Canada, including the security priorities of the federal government and
indigenous groups; the nature of indigenous understandings of 'security'
in the Canadian Arctic; and the effectiveness (i.e. policy influence) of
indigenous securitizing moves.Constituting (In)Security The Copenhagen
School's Securitization Theory [The logic of security is [the logic of
emergency]{.mark}; it [invokes an **existential challenge** to a given
referent object to justify **extraordinary measures** in the protection
of that object]{.mark}. Security]{.underline}, however, [is]{.underline}
not an absolute property or fixed state, but rather an inter-subjective,
[aspirational condition characterized by effective response to the
threat of danger to a given referent object's continued existence or
wellbeing]{.underline}. The conceptualization of security as socially
constructed has been most prominently developed by the Copenhagen
School's (CS) securitization theory, particularly the work of Ole Wæver
and Barry Buzan. In the School's original theorization, security is
neither characterized by the absence of threat per se, nor is it a
binary opposite to insecurity; instead[, "insecurity is the situation
when there is a threat and no defence against it; security is a
situation with a threat and a defence against it." 1 Security is thus
not constituted by]{.underline} the absence of threat, but by [the
identification of a threat and a suitable defence-response]{.underline}.
The Copenhagen securitization theory, however, is explicitly not
concerned with identifying 'real' security threats, but rather
identifying the discursive and performative processes that transform a
given issue into a security threat "requiring emergency measures and
justifying actions outside the normal bounds of political procedure." 2
Thus, ['security threats' are not inherently so; rather "the
performative speech act part -- the securitising move -- only evolves
into a complete securitisation at the point when a designated 'audience'
accepts the speech act."]{.underline} 3 The CS theory is "radically
constructivist" in that ['security' is determined by the success of
particular security speech acts, or 'securitizing moves,'
in]{.underline} elevating an issue -- in theory, any issue -- to the
fore of the audience's consciousness and the apex of political priority.
4 [Spoken, written, and performed representations of (in)security can be
considered tactical manoeuvring by actors seeking to securitize 'their'
issue. The process of speaking and/or writing security and having those
security claims accepted by the appropriate audience is the essence of
securitization theory;]{.underline} "'security' is thus a
self-referential practice, because it is [in this practice that [the
issue becomes a security issue -- **not necessarily** because a real
existential threat exists but because the issue is **presented as
such**]{.mark} a threat." 5]{.underline} The radically constructed
nature of security is the source of the CS theory's analytical strength
and normative weakness. [Analytically, [examining the **discursive** and
**performative** ways that security is constructed provides
**explanatory leverage**]{.mark} over competing or contradictory
representations of]{.underline} security within a particular context or
for a particular referent object. Securitization theory offers a
powerful framework for examining the success and failure of different
securitizing moves, including the successful securitization of phenomena
that bear little resemblance to quantifiable security issues affecting
observable or valued referent objects. 6 [Indeed, it provides a
theoretical lens for understanding how security is always
contested]{.underline}, or at least is always susceptible to
contestation.

### 2NC\-\--L\-\--Arctic Environment

#### Assertions of ecological masculinity in the Arctic create destructive relationships with the environment, further ecological crisis, create security problems, and perpetuate violence against women

Gender, nature and ideology

My starting point is that an analysis of how [far-right ideology adopts,
appropriates and communicates varieties of environmental
thinking]{.underline} can be [crystallised through the **lens of
gender**]{.underline}. According to Forchtner and Kølvraa (2015),
far-right ideology is connected to the environment in different
dimensions: the land is the [aesthetic pride]{.underline} of the nation,
a [material resource for its survival]{.underline} and a symbol of
[cultural hygiene]{.underline}. Thus, the [[nation endures when]{.mark}
its [territori]{.mark}al integrity is [preserved and]{.mark} its
**[purity defended]{.mark}**]{.underline}. An examination of ELAM's
visual environmental communication shows that the concepts of [[purity
and control are central]{.mark} both [in]{.mark} nationalist ideology
and [patriarchal relations]{.mark}]{.underline} which, in turn, are
symbolically demonstrated in representations of the natural environment.
I echo here Douglas' (2003 \[1966\]) powerful thesis in Purity and
Danger where she argues that [[rituals of removing
pollution]{.underline}]{.mark} (dirt, dust, harmful substances) [are
[investments]{.mark} both [in cleanliness]{.mark}]{.underline} and in
communal formations of social boundaries. Indeed, as Forchtner (2019c)
has argued, the far right's [[quest for land purity]{.underline}]{.mark}
uses, among others, the language of 'invasive species' in the natural
world as a metaphor to describe the presence of migrants in the
territory of the endangered national group.

The gender symbolism of the natural environment has been meticulously
explored in Ortner's (1972) classic essay 'Is Female to Male as Nature
Is to Culture?', where she attempts to explain the question of women's
universal devaluation. Ortner argues that beyond the easily identifiable
practices of calling women inferior or assigning them to marginal
positions in society, there must be other symbolic ways through which
these practices are legitimised. She finds the answer in another
universal phenomenon: the relationship between nature and culture which
is a relationship of control. Thus, she points out: 'the pan-cultural
devaluation of woman could be accounted for, quite simply, by
postulating that [[woman]{.mark} is being [identified]{.mark}
[with]{.mark}, or symbolically associated with, [nature]{.mark}, as
[opposed to man]{.mark}, who is [identified with
culture']{.mark}]{.underline} (Ortner, 1972: 11--12).

Ortner argues that women's identification with nature begins with her
body and its reproductive function, is extended into the social roles
that reproduction entails (raising children, preparing food, sustaining
life) and ends with the belief that women are 'like nature' because they
are the key to procreation. Thus, women's physiology becomes their
destiny, and their mothering function reflects 'women's psyche'. In
contrast, men occupy the higher domain of culture and are seen as too
sophisticated to be tending to the needs of animal-like small species.
For Ortner, [[men]{.mark} are [tasked with]{.mark} developing [culture,
which]{.mark} oftentimes [involves]{.mark} regulating and [controlling
nature]{.mark} (hunting, [mining]{.mark}, [drilling]{.mark},
[exploring]{.mark}). As [women are, thus]{.mark}, seen as being closer
to nature than men, they are often [portrayed as]{.mark} driven by
[emotional]{.mark}, almost '[animalistic']{.mark}
instincts]{.underline}, while the cool, calm, collected figure of the
man is the rational voice in the room.

Beyond symbolism, connections between gender and the environment can be
traced on different levels. As a variable, gender determines differences
in attitudes between men and women, with women exhibiting greater
concern for environmental degradation (Joireman and Liu; 2014) even at a
young age (Zelezny et al., 2000). Interestingly, there are indications
that [[women's greater political participation]{.mark} in a country is
[linked to]{.mark} the country's [lower carbon]{.mark} dioxide
[emissions]{.mark}]{.underline} (Ergas and York, 2012). Other studies
have shown that gender effects are minimal compared to the explanatory
power of political affiliation and political ideology in accounting for
beliefs in climate change (Hornsey et al., 2016). Women also seem to
know more about climate change compared to men, although they tend to
underestimate the breadth of their knowledge (McCright, 2010). Men's
lack of urgency for the environment has been dubbed the 'cool dude'
effect (McCright and Dunlap, 2011), which is partially explained by the
type of white conservative male who overrates his understanding of
global warming while endorsing denialist views. Some of this variability
can be accounted for by differential gendered vulnerabilities in
relation to the immediate and long-term impact of climate change
(Pearse, 2017). [Feminist perspectives emphasise that [this is a direct
result of]{.mark} structural constraints in the [social positioning of
men and women]{.mark}]{.underline} and note that these constraints are
even more pronounced for women in the Global South (Roy, 2018).

This is where the space of ecofeminist thought has expanded the gender--
environment connection beyond mainstream approaches. Despite
essentialist undertones associated with its rise in the 1970s,
ecofeminism is not about women who believe they can save the earth
simply because they are women. Gaard (2015), for example, steers away
from approaches where women are called to 'mother the Earth' or are
constructed as victims of environmental destruction. Instead, she
proposes an ecofeminist, intersectional approach and argues that:

> [[\[C\]limate change and]{.mark} first world [overconsumption are
> produced by **Masculinist Ideology**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}
> and will [[not]{.mark} be [solved by **Masculinist
> Techno-Science**]{.mark}]{.underline} approaches.
> **[Instead]{.underline}**, I propose, [queer [feminist posthumanist
> climate justice]{.mark} perspectives [at the local, national,]{.mark}
> and [global levels]{.mark}]{.underline} are [**[needed]{.underline}**
> to]{.mark} intervene and [transform]{.mark} [both our
> [analyses]{.mark}]{.underline} [and]{.mark} our [[solutions to climate
> change]{.underline}]{.mark}. (Gaard, 2015: 20--21)

The [contribution of feminist theory to radicalising environmental
thought lies in [critiquing]{.mark} both [masculine ideals and]{.mark}
the [patriarchal practices]{.mark}]{.underline} [that underpin]{.mark}
the [[destruction of the environment]{.mark}]{.underline} (Warren, 2000;
Plumwood, 2002) while, at the same time, [[open]{.mark}ing up the
[debate]{.mark}]{.underline} [to]{.mark} other intersections of
[[dominance and exploitation]{.underline}]{.mark}. This has extended
feminist theoretical explorations of care into the animal world and our
relations with other non-human species (Kheel, 2008; Adams and Gruen,
2014). Kheel (2008), for example, develops Carol Gilligan's [['ethic of
care']{.underline}]{.mark} into the idea of 'contextualized care', that
is, employing empathy in our relations with the living world and
avoiding harm and exploitation. Thus, [ecofeminism [shift]{.mark}s
[ecological debates to questions of control, oppression and
domination]{.mark}]{.underline} that run as key themes in both gender
relations and relations between humans and the environment.

Building on these foundations is the notion of 'ecological
masculinities' (Hultman and Pulé, 2018; Pulé and Hultman, 2021), which
embraces the feminist critique of domination of nature and argues that a
critical examination of [[industrial masculinities needs to be part of
these debates.]{.underline}]{.mark} Indeed, [[hegemonic versions of
masculinity]{.mark} have been [at]{.mark} the
[forefront]{.mark}]{.underline} of encounters wit[h nature given that
hunting, [colonial conquest and oil rigging]{.mark}]{.underline} have
not only been [[means of]{.mark} [accumulating]{.mark} economic
[wealth]{.mark}]{.underline} or developing [[innovative
science]{.underline}]{.mark} but also [[domains of masculine
validation]{.mark}]{.underline} (Pulé et al., 2021). Thus, any [[effort
to address]{.mark} the current [climate crisis]{.mark}]{.underline} or
humanity's relationship with the environment [[must resist]{.mark} those
instances where a camouflaged [ecological
masculinity]{.mark}]{.underline} mimics ecological thinking. As I show,
the parochial environmental agenda of ELAM in Cyprus belongs in this
category as it serves narrow populist interests. More importantly, I
argue that [they]{.mark} do not adopt an ecological [approach]{.mark} to
[climate change]{.mark} but see this as an opportunity [to [restore
hegemonic masculinity]{.underline} through]{.mark} the brawny [[male
performance]{.mark} of saving the burning land]{.underline} and
liberating occupied areas.

Theoretical underpinnings: feminist approaches to Arctic oil and gas
Feminist scholarship has brought attention to the role of gender,
intersectionality and gendered structures within Arctic research, which
have previously been overlooked (see, e.g. Hoogensen Gjørv, 2017;
Kuokkanen, 2007; Seag, Badhe, & Choudhry, 2020; Sinevaara-Niskanen,
2015, 2019; Vladimirova & Habeck, 2018). Nevertheless, even though
gender has emerged to the agenda of Arctic politics and research already
20 years ago (see, e.g. Taking Wing conference 2002), "gender has
remained a 'feature' relevant to certain issues only and an attribute of
certain people (women) only" (Sinevaara-Niskanen, 2015). While some
research exists on masculinities in the Arctic (see, e.g. Ventsel,
2018), in addition to other intersecting identities, gender has yet to
become a primary category for defining social and political relations in
the Arctic (Hoogensen Gjørv, 2017). The [[historical
**narrative**]{.mark} of the [Arctic as]{.mark} a **[frontier]{.mark}**,
as a territory to be **conquered**]{.underline} (Aarekol, 2016; Ryall et
al., 2010; Vladimirova & Habeck, 2018), has also [impacted the ways in
which energy companies frame the Arctic region]{.underline}. Jackman et
al. (2020) reflect on the concepts of terrain and territory, encouraging
a feminist perspective for approaching and re-crafting them. This allows
expanding the historical approach towards understanding a region like
the Arctic, which has been ["told and retold as a story of **control**
enabled by calculative technologies"]{.underline} (Jackman et al., 2020,
p.3). The history of Arctic (male) explorers and, for example,
[glaciology, in which the performance of masculinity determined the
dominant knowledge within the field]{.underline} (Carey et al., 2016;
Hevly, 1996), have also [impacted current narratives]{.underline} on the
region. Jackman et al. (2020) argue that the [**historical**
conceptualizations linked with masculinity]{.underline}, such as those
positioned within the Arctic as a space, [should be questioned to better
understand the **current** ones]{.underline}. One reason for the narrow
focus on gender issues within Arctic research has to do with the
[[modernist project of mastering nature]{.mark} and the image of the
Arctic,]{.underline} which underlines the [[**heroism** of the (male)
explorers]{.mark} or male workers [overcoming]{.mark} the [harsh
conditions]{.mark} affecting the oil, reindeer herding or mineral
**extraction** industries]{.underline} (Vladimirova & Habeck, 2018).
Introducing feminist approaches to the masculine arena of the Arctic
hydrocarbon industry is a way to shed light on the values underpinning
it. Tickner, a pioneer in feminist international relations, suggested
already in 1992 that in order to achieve an ecologically secure future,
the system of values must simultaneously respect nature, women and
diversity of cultures -- "norms that have been missing from the
historical practices of statecraft" (Tickner, 1992, p.126) and
undoubtedly from the global oil regime as well. In this article, I
approach the oil and gas production from a feminist social
constructivist perspective, building on valuable discussions in feminist
international relations and feminist geography. By applying a feminist
constructivist approach to identify how energy companies justify their
practices, the article adopts three underlining assumptions: first, the
understanding that [language **matters** and has the power to construct
the world and the dominant narratives and discourses within
it]{.underline}. Second, the assumption that [the material produced by
the companies has a **political** meaning and the power to **shape
narratives** in relation to Arctic politics]{.underline} (Lempinen,
2019b; Livesey, 2002; Scarce & Ockwell, 2010), and third, [the
recognition that the **role of gender** and unequal power dynamics
between gendered discourses **impact Arctic issues**]{.underline}
(Hoogensen Gjørv, 2017; Sinevaara-Niskanen, 2019; 2015). Entanglements
of gender and fossil fuels Comprehending fossil fuel production requires
accounting for its multiple societal dimensions, such as gender, race
and class. The literature discussing gender within extractive industries
usually refers to women's roles; however, [gender as an analytical tool
could and should be broadened to examine the masculinities and
femininities within the oil and gas industry]{.underline} as well as
other intersecting identities and structures. In this paper, the
[concept of gender refers to **socially constructed** identities and
differences between the categories of men and women, which allude to the
characteristics assigned to the categories of masculine and
feminine]{.underline}. These categories are always culturally specific
and change over time (Connell & Pearse, 2014; Hoogensen Gjørv, 2017;
Tickner, 2001). [[Extractive industries]{.underline}]{.mark} have been
argued to [[belong to a culture of masculinity]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Daggett, 2018; Kojola, 2019; Miller, 2004), and they have
[**[historically]{.mark}** been rather **[male
dominated]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Daggett (2018) has forcefully argued
that [[there is a relationship between **fossil fuels** and the **white
patriarchal order**]{.underline}]{.mark}, proposing the concept of
**[[petro-masculinity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Miller (2004) has examined
the oil industry in Alberta, Canada, and concluded [three aspects
constructing masculinity [within the industr]{.mark}y]{.underline}:
"[everyday interactions which **exclude** women; values and beliefs
specific to the dominant occupation of engineering which **reinforce**
gender divisions; and a consciousness derived from the powerful symbols
of the **frontier myth** and the romanticized cowboy
**hero**"]{.underline} (Miller, 2004, p.47). In the Arctic, the [history
of exploration together with the [idea of **conquering**]{.mark}
**nature** has been updated and [**transferred** to]{.mark} the [modern
**hydrocarbon industry**]{.mark}]{.underline}. (Female) gender is
missing from the energyscape in the Barents region (Lempinen, 2018). The
imagery and role models visible to the public to affect perceptions of
the industry (European Institute for Gender Equity, 2016, p.6).
Nevertheless, the dichotomy between femininity and masculinity is no
longer so simplistic within the modern hydrocarbon industry in Norway
and Russia, or within the Arctic, and "the debate is already moving
beyond such stereotypes and structural limitations" (Vladimirova &
Habeck, 2018, p.148). In this article I focus on the justifications
utilized to support the continuing production as well as on the
construction of gender. When analyzing the material, it became evident
that especially in the Russian context, [the presentation of gender
meant a presentation of masculinity]{.underline}, as the majority of the
people presented in the webpages were male. Connell, a pioneer in
masculinity studies, emphasizes that [we should discuss masculinities,
not masculinity]{.underline}. Multiple masculinities exist within a
certain gender order (Connell, 1995) and the performance on masculinity
relies "on maneuvering between several competing [[gender
regimes]{.mark} which [function within historical gender
orders]{.mark}]{.underline}" such as the Soviet and post-Soviet context
(Yusupova, 2016, p.31). [The construction and [performance]{.mark} of
various masculinities can be only [done within]{.mark} a certain
[framework laid out by the state]{.mark}]{.underline} (Yusupova, 2016).
For instance, Vladimir Putin's "hypermasculinity" is playing a crucial
role in the contemporary re-masculinization of Russia (Sperling, 2015;
Yusupova, 2016). Ventsel (2018) has examined the dominant masculinities
in Siberia, specifically in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), where the
[discourse of conquering nature has **deep roots**]{.underline}. In
Soviet times, Yakutia was one of the nation's resource-extraction
frontiers, characterized by a pronounced proletarian "hard" masculinity
that continued well into the 2000s. Recently, according to Ventsel, more
urban, "softer" masculinities have emerged (Ventsel 2018, pp.210-- 211).
The [masculine identity of an oil worker]{.underline} that provides for
his family is an important incentive to [work in the "extreme"
North]{.underline} (Saxinger 2015, p.95). However, it is noteworthy that
the [evolution towards stricter definition of gender roles can be
interpreted as a result of **colonial** regimes and
**modernization**]{.underline}, also in the context of the Russian (and
Norwegian) north (Vladimirova & Habeck, 2018; Ziker, 2010), since many
[**indigenous** cultures have traditionally not had binary gender
division and roles]{.underline}. What do masculinities look like in the
Nordic context, specifically in Norway? An interesting concept
introduced by Hultman (2013) is **[ecomodern masculinity]{.underline}**.
In the 1990s, the discourse of ecomodernism began to expand globally,
wherein economic growth provides the basis for transition to a more
sustainable future (Hultman, 2013; Anshelm & Hultman, 2014). Hultman
suggests that with ecomodern masculinity, [gender identity is connected
to care for the environment and economic growth]{.underline}. Anshelm &
Hultman (2014) noted that with industrial masculinity shifting towards
ecomodern masculinity, an emphasis on toughness and hardness is replaced
by care and responsibility. Those ascribing to the new ecomodern
masculinity still desire to expand economic growth via technological
progress but do so while simultaneously caring for the environment
(Anshelm & Hultman, 2014). The notion of ecomodern masculinity therefore
encompasses attempts to address environmental problems, especially
climate change, while supporting policies and technologies connected to
climate-destroying systems (Anshelm & Hultman, 2014; Hultman 2013).
Ecomodern masculinity can be linked to the concept of green economy, in
which the green economy offers an arena for economic opportunities,
achieved by technological solutions (Caprotti & Bailey, 2014). The
ecomodern discourse is strongly present within the claims currently made
by Arctic hydrocompanies, which argue that they are combining technology
and ecology, an argument that [ultimately serves the interests of
continuing to drill for oil and gas]{.underline}. [The narrative of
territory (especially in the Arctic context) has been characterized by
the "dominance of a calculative lens"]{.underline} (Jackman et al.,
2020, p.2) emphasizing the role of technology. In a similar vein,
feminist scholars have criticized the [[framing]{.mark} of [climate
change as]{.mark} a [tech]{.mark}nological
[challenge]{.mark}]{.underline} (see, e.g. Haraway, 2016; MacGregor,
2010, 2009) and likewise politics of energy transitions have been
criticized for their [technocratic description that [ignores]{.mark}
gender and [social dimensions]{.mark}]{.underline} (Lieu et al., 2020).
[While responding to the challenges of ecological crises with green
techno-scientific innovations **has value**, the technological focus
**also** [enables "searching for the new rather than improving the
old]{.mark}]{.underline}; more omnipotence rather than humble reflection
on the benefits and the costs of male-dominated scientific ingenuity to
date" (MacGregor, 2009, p.133). In her writing, MacGregor (2010) has
examined the [politics of climate change and argues that it is framed by
gendered discourses]{.underline}. She has demonstrated how the social
constructs of masculinity and femininity emerge and are reproduced
within the dominant discourses. Her work identifies [[**ecological
modernization** and **environmental security**]{.mark} as [**top-down**
approaches connected to **masculinity**]{.mark}]{.underline}, whereas,
for example, the [[**individual** duty]{.mark} to protect the
environment is [linked to **femininity**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(MacGregor, 2010). Feminist scholars have criticized traditional
[[ecomodernist solutions]{.underline}]{.mark} that have [simultaneously
[facilitated]{.mark} a "[**downgrading** of **ethical**
concerns,]{.mark}" such as justice, economic equity or
healt]{.underline}h (MacGregor, 2009, p.128). Feminist (and
postcolonial) perspectives should be laid out as a counterpoint to
technological understandings of the earth (Jackman et al., 2020) and
remain at the center when new terrains are explored (Jackman et al.,
2020; Squire & Dodds, 2020). Feminist discussions on environment
[highlight the significance of care and ethics within climate
change]{.underline}, especially in relation to future generations and
global inequalities (see, e.g. Powys & Cuomo, 2017; Robinson, 2011).
Care is not a property of feminist research; however, its idea is often
embedded within feminist ideas on, for example, human and non-human
(Bauhardt & Harcourt, 2019). The question of future generations is
embedded within feminist ethics of care, which becomes an important
issue with the opening of new oil and gas fields in the Arctic.
[**[Extractivism]{.mark}**, and more specifically oil and gas drilling,
arises from the **[ontological premise]{.mark}** where understanding of
the [land]{.mark} and having ["permission" to use]{.mark} it are based
on an [**anthropocentric**, Western **division** between
**human**]{.mark} beings [and **nature**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is
[extremely visible in the exploitation of the Arctic fossil fuels, made
possible with the help of modern technology]{.underline}. [Technology is
not created in a vacuum; rather, it is the product of longstanding
historical sociopolitical developments]{.underline} (Jasanoff, 2015). In
a similar manner to Haraway, who has identified how [society worships
science and forgets its own role in its creatio]{.underline}n (1991,
p.8), the present study identifies and problematizes the dominance of
technology, especially within an industry that greatly contributes to
global emissions, and hence, has an influence on more than just the
Arctic region. Method and material: justification analysis of Arctic
hydrocarbon companies' self-representation This paper examines Norwegian
and Russian companies' perceptions of the Arctic and the image they
model for the public with material consisting of sections of three
Arctic energy company webpages. I approach the webpages through a
feminist version of justification analysis, including some discussion on
visual methods. Justification analysis builds on the work of Boltanski
and Thévenot, De La Justification (On Justification, 1991\[2006\]).
Their core idea is that [in order to convince other people in public
discussion, one must justify such a position by referring to a generally
accepted common goo]{.underline}d[. Within public debates, a limited set
of moral principles is utilised to support such arguments. For example,
justifying a claim in economic terms means taking a moral stand wherein
money is the measure of worth]{.underline} (YläAnttila & Luhtakallio,
2016, p.2). Moral principles are widely shared by different participants
but are often understood differently (Ylä-Anttila & Luhtakallio, 2016).
[In the context of the Arctic hydrocarbon industry, justification
analysis is useful in revealing and challenging the values on which the
companies base their continuous operations]{.underline}. Understandings
of the "common good" vary across time and society; however, Boltanski
and Thevénot have proposed six "worlds of justification" based on values
commonly recognised by societies in general. The seventh justification
was added later. The fixed [frames, or worlds, of justification are
based on values emerging from the industrial, civic, market-oriented,
fame-driven, ecological, domestic and inspirational
domains]{.underline}. Boltanski and Thevénot (2006, pp.203--201)
describe the industrial world as one dominated by technology, efficiency
and progress. In the context of this article, the industrial world
refers to the importance of new technologies being utilised by the
Arctic oil and gas industry as well as the importance of technology in
addressing environmental concerns. The civic world is one where value is
not given to individuals, but to the collectives they form. Legal
systems and civic rights are the basis of this value (Boltanski &
Thévenot, 2006, pp.185--193) as well as democratic means of agreeing on
the rules (Ylä-Anttila & Luhtakallio, 2016). In this research, the
worlds based on civic values refer to the companies' responsibility to
produce energy for the world, to work within the constraints of existing
legislation and to bring benefits to local communities. In the market
world, "actions are motivated by desire" (Boltanski & Thévenot, 2006,
p.196). Objects considered worthy of desire are those that have value or
a strong position in the market. Therefore, the market world refers here
to the economic value of the Arctic hydrocarbon industry both for the
companies' shareholders and for the respective countries. Within the
world of fame, the opinion of others plays a crucial role, in addition
to visibility and notoriety. Being recognised for what one does is
important (Boltanski & Thévevnot, 2006). In the context of this study,
fame is understood and presented as the companies being perceived as
leaders and pioneers in the Arctic realm, much in the manner of early
polar explorers. In the ecological world well-being of the environment
is the focal point (Thévevnot, Moody, & Lafaye, 2000). In this study,
the ecological world refers to the well-being of the pristine Arctic
environment and its flora and fauna. In the domestic world, according to
Boltanski and Thévenot (2006, pp.164--165), the worth given to the
objects is based on their contribution to hierarchical relations among
people, as connected to generations and tradition. In the research
material, the domestic world can be understood as the value that, for
example, the gas distribution system in Russia brings to the country.
The inspirational world was not visible in the research material and so
will not be a point of focus in this research. From this initial
premise, scholars have developed a method of [justification
analysis]{.underline} (Ylä-Anttila & Kukkonen, 2014; Ylä-Anttila &
Luhtakallio, 2016[) to analyse the claims made and the moral stands
taken in public debates.]{.underline} Within public media justification
analysis, [a unit of analysis consists of one claim. A claim is a "unit
of action in the public sphere"]{.underline} (Koopmans, 2006). [A claim
can be a statement]{.underline} made to a reporter, [a speech,
or,]{.underline} for example, [a demonstration]{.underline} (Koopmans,
2006; Ylä-Anttila & Luhtakallio, 2016). Once such a claim is made,
justification analysis assesses the given worth or value upon it is
based. A combination of values can be found in a single claim. As with
many social science methods, the coding of the claims is not inductive,
but based on fixed categories -- the worths. Therefore, [justification
analysis is **especially** suitable for **comparative analysis**, as the
cases are approached from the same justification principles]{.underline}
(Ylä-Anttila & Luhtakallio, 2016). Justification analysis has been
utilised mainly for analysing mass media (Ylä-Anttila et al., 2018;
Ylä-Anttila & Kukkonen, 2014; Ylä-Anttila & Luhtakallio, 2016) but also
for Russian energy strategies (Salonen, 2018). Employing justification
analysis to assess company webpages differs somewhat from the analysis
of traditional media material. The webpages of hydrocarbon companies
exist for a certain reason -- the webpages themselves are crafted to
convince the audience of the validity of the claims. Therefore, while a
newspaper article may contain, for example, three claims for a story, I
argue that a webpage itself is one large claim, and the analysis aims to
identify the nature of the values upon which the individual underlying
claims are based. Following the path laid out by Ylä-Anttila and
Luhtakallio (2016) and Salonen (2018), I first determined the sections
of the material that contained a specific claim. Second, I identified
claims that make a reference to a world (or worlds). Finally, I
identified and categorised the claims and their references according to
the fixed worlds of justification. For example, going through the
webpages of Equinor, I first identified the sections that made a
specific claim (e.g. section Sustainability) and after that went through
the content sentence by sentence and identified the claims that refer to
the fixed worlds of justification (e.g. ecological world). Because this
research is qualitative in nature, the frequency of the claims is not
discussed extensively, but rather the focus is on their content. Since
the material consists of webpages, it would be limiting to exclude a
large portion of their content -- images. We live in an era of
visuality, and so visual analysis should not be ignored when analysing
webpages. Hence, this article also draws from discussions on visual
methodology to present the webpages in their entirety. Haraway (1988,
p.581) has explored social power relations with respect to the
availability of visual "gluttony" and how it is linked to a "history of
science tied to militarism, capitalism, colonialism, and male
supremacy." Such power relations produce social differences (e.g.
hierarchies of class, gender, race), while claiming to not belong to any
hierarchy (Haraway, 1988). This is especially interesting when
considering oil and gas companies, as the fossil fuel industry is one of
the most powerful industries in the world. Webpages utilised to create a
desire for Arctic exploration The material for this article consists of
certain sections from the webpages of three hydrocarbon companies
(collected in summer/fall 2019) working in the Arctic. The webpages of
energy companies tend to represent a general company policy -- or at
least what the companies expect the public to perceive positively, and
therefore, the webpages help them gain public support. The webpages
presumably target the national political sphere, international consumer
states, investors and civil society. The audience is not homogeneous --
therefore, justification strategies differ. [By studying the material
produced by the energy industry, one can "understand better what kind of
power, truths and identities" the industry is constructing]{.underline}
(Tynkkynen, 2016, p.375). The [energy industry utilises advertising to
"establish a desire for opening Arctic regions to commercial
exploitation"]{.underline} (Mason, 2016). I do not approach the
[webpages]{.underline} as sources of a single truth, but rather as a
[way for the industry to present its claims to the public]{.underline}.
The webpages of state-owned companies are clearly an aspect of
marketing, but also a tool and even a platform for discussion. The
webpages actively stake out a position for companies in societal
discussions. For example on Equinor's webpage, a section focusing on the
activities in the Barents Sea includes a sub-section Concerns and
Frequently asked questions, with both sections directly addressing the
concerns of environmental organisations about Arctic drilling (see, e.g.
Greenpeace Norge). Gazprom Neft's webpages only discuss the
environmental effects of an individual project regarding Prirazlomnoye,
an offshore platform that received much international attention in 2013
when Greenpeace activists were arrested for trying to seize the
operation for environmental reasons (Greenpeace Russia, 2019).
Prirazlomnoye, however, is currently the only offshore project in the
Russian Arctic, which could further raise environmental concerns linked
to it. Comparisons of the Norwegian, Russian and English webpages
revealed that the content on the webpages was approximately the same
regardless of the language. Hence, this study is limited to the English
versions of the company webpages. The webpages are rich in content and
consist of text, photos, videos and reports. To begin, I went through
all the sections to get an idea of their content. Next, I focused on the
sections connected to Arctic hydrocarbon activities. The homepages of
all the companies and company overviews provided were included in the
analysis. In addition, other parts focus on ongoing Arctic projects
(with subsections) as well as on activities in the Arctic (for example,
Equinor's webpages include sections such as Our activities in the North
and Safely exploring the Barents Sea). Sections focusing on the
environment, sustainability and engagement with indigenous peoples (for
example, Gazprom Neft's webpages include a section on Engaging with the
peoples of the Russian Far North) were included. The webpages ranged
from August to October 2019. Since the webpages are "living," meaning
they are being continuously updated, the material was transferred to
separate documents and the analysis was conducted from there. **[The
gendered worlds of justification]{.underline}** After reading through
the research material with the help of justification analysis, six
worlds of justification and their combinations were identified. Based on
the findings, the following four subsections have been organized
thematically. The first subsection addresses the [importance of
technology and its ability to overcome both physical challenges as well
as challenges related to climate change and the
environment]{.underline}. The second subsection focuses on the [role of
the economy]{.underline}. In addition, it also [compares early polar
explorers with the search for new oil and gas fields as well as the
discourse of being an Arctic leader]{.underline}. The third subsection
assesses the meaning of the ecological world in the webpages.
Furthermore, it also focuses on the [representations of
gender]{.underline}. The fourth subsection discusses the companies'
[emphasis on the wider benefits of having an industry in one's country
and community]{.underline}. The [first two subsections]{.underline} and
the worlds they present navigate in the discursive and cultural
constructions [historically associated with masculine practices, working
in the public domain instead of the private]{.underline}. The last two
subsections move somewhere in between masculine and feminine discursive
and cultural constructions (MacGregor, 2010). The analysis shows how the
companies are [building the justifications while **reproducing** and
**reinforcing** the **gendered foundations** and
stereotypes]{.underline}. Excerpts from the research material are
utilized to demonstrate how the justifications serve the interests of
oil and gas companies. Industrial world -- technology will save us?
Since the companies are working in harsh conditions, the role of
technology is important. All the companies put an especially visible
focus on the industrial world. Justifications based on technological
measures and the belief in technology are strong: Drawing on technology,
competence and experience from harsh weather operations, we are
approaching the North with a strong focus on safe operations and respect
for the environment. Research and development programs are tailored to
meet the technological challenges ahead, such as drilling and production
systems, long distance transportation of unprocessed oil and gas,
material science, oil spill response and health and working environment
in cold climates. (Equinor, 2019) Unique technological and logistical
solutions mean oil is being produced, stored, shipped and transported
all year round under the ultra-challenging environmental and climatic
conditions of the waters of the Arctic. (Gazprom Neft, 2019) Overcoming
the Yamal Peninsula's harsh climate and environment, Gazprom has made
Yamal its launch pad for efficient, safe and innovative technologies and
technical solutions. (Gazprom, 2019) An emphasis on technology and
infrastructure utilized within the operations conducted in the harsh
conditions of the Arctic is visible throughout the webpages. In
addition, technology is important for the challenges of addressing
environmental questions. The visual side of the material emphasises the
technologyoriented nature of the industry -- a large number of the
photos on all the company websites show production facilities and
provide technical details. Often, the images are from a bird's-eye
perspective observing the production facilities or the Arctic
wilderness. This reminds me of Haraway's concept of the god trick "of
seeing everything from nowhere," in which [modern technology has "put
the myth into ordinary practice. And like the god trick, this eye fucks
the world to make techno-monsters"]{.underline} (Haraway, 1988, p.581).
The opening image on Gazprom's website is an aerial image of Europe at
nighttime with electric lights shining in every corner of the region,
presumably powered by Russian gas. Equinor has a similar photo of
Scandinavia, in a section on Safely Exploring in the Barents Sea. In all
three cases, several images show oil rigs, production facilities and
ships surrounded by ice -- from the bird's-eye or "god" perspective. In
Haraway's writing, [god trick is connected to a larger **dilemma of
objectivity**, which in feminist understanding is **never** completely
possible, as knowledge is **always situated**.]{.underline} Such
[**objectivity** and "knowing all"]{.underline} are also [related
to]{.underline} what Connell and Pearse (2014) write in relation to
climate change, specifically [how "gender research into environmental
politics shows that a **masculine God-like view** of the global problem
has merged into **technocratic**, marketized 'solutions' to
environmental crisis.]{.underline}" The imagery of industrial facilities
supports justifications based on the industrialized technological world.
The [claims based on industrial world **represent** and **reproduce** a
**masculine value system** building on the ability to **control** nature
and harness its resources for a commodity of humans]{.underline}. Laying
the groundwork for ecomodern discourse, claims based on the
industrial-ecological world are substantial. The nature of the
references varies somewhat between the companies. While Gazprom's claims
with respect to technology and the environment are more pragmatic and
linked to direct environmental issues, those of Equinor and Gazprom Neft
[highlight technology as a tool for solving problems stemming from
climate change]{.underline}. Gazprom prioritizes innovative development
and advancement from the technological and organizational standpoints as
the key prerequisites for the efficient and sustainable development of
the oil and gas sector and Russia's fuel and energy complex at large.
(Gazprom, 2019) One of today's most urgent problems---climate
change---is connected to environmental emissions of \[greenhouse
gases\]. Gazprom Neft is doing its bit to address this problem with a
programme to increase the productive use of associated petroleum gas
(APG) produced in oil production as well as concurrently implementing
several major projects in this area. (Gazprom Neft, 2019). It's
supplying the world with energy, creating value for society---and not
least, reducing CO2 emissions from production by up to 90%. The Paris
Agreement is quite clear that the world will still need oil as part of
its energy mix. But which oil is produced, should be produced as cleanly
as possible. (Equinor, 2019) These descriptions draw attention to
technology's role in addressing environmental issues and to the
companies' pioneering role in dealing with environmental problems. [[New
projects]{.mark} are [justified through their capacity to
operate]{.mark} as cleanly as possible]{.underline}. According to the
Norwegian actor, oil needs to be drilled and Equinor can do it in the
best (cleanest and safest) way possible. [This [**framing** of climate
change via technological solutions is]{.mark} an example of the
[**masculinization** of responses to c]{.mark}limate [c]{.mark}hange,
where [solutions]{.mark} come [from]{.mark} the traditional [domain of
men and **hegemonic masculinity**]{.mark}]{.underline} (MacGregor,
2010). In Norway, and to a certain extent in Russia too, the [discourse
regarding the harmony of economic growth via technology and
environmental protection can also be connected to the discussion on
ecomodern masculinities]{.underline} (Anshelm & Hultman, 2014; Hultman,
2013). Worlds of market and fame -- economic heroism When discussing the
justifications offered by the energy companies working in the Arctic, a
rationalist approach would assume that economic reasons are the main
objective for expanding production. However, all three companies rarely
make claims based purely on market worth. Claims based on the market
world thus refer to economic value, but not solely. Gazprom and Gazprom
Neft refer to [pragmatic actions aiming at cost efficiency]{.underline}.
Equinor's claims emphasize local economic development and the creation
of value for its stakeholders. When bringing promising fields into
production, Gazprom aims to ensure economic efficiency by expanding gas
production facilities concurrently with gas transmission, comprehensive
processing and storage capacities. (Gazprom, 2019) Supported by this the
company is able to ensure year-round shipments of all oil produced, at
minimal cost. (Gazprom Neft, 2019) Through our core business and supply
chain, we create economic value and opportunities for society and
communities. We create jobs and develop capabilities among our own
employees and beyond our company. (Equinor, 2019) The lack of claims
based purely on market worth indicates that the companies are responding
to changing expectations in the international context surrounding
emerging climate concerns, by recognizing that it is not acceptable to
base arguments purely on economic growth. [Like technology, economy is
not something created in a **vacuum**, but instead it is always a
**gendered** human **construct**]{.underline} (Mellor, 2017). The
ecofeminist notion on political economy is relevant for discussing the
market world and the capitalist system where the companies are working:
"[Instead of seeing economies as natural forms based on universal
economic laws, ecofeminist political economy sees modern economies as
ecologically unsustainable and socially unjust]{.underline}" (Mellor,
2017, p.86). Economy, as we currently know it, is based on the
exploitation of nature and its resources. The circulation of the concept
of [[green economy]{.mark} has [impacted]{.mark} the ways [how companies
**address** the public]{.mark}]{.underline}. The renaissance of the
concept has affected how businesses work and frame themselves in order
to survive (Caprotti & Bailey, 2014). Earlier research on the U.S-based
oil company Exxon Mobil's advertorial [campaign addressing climate
change in 2000 reveals the company's [aim to present]{.mark} business
and [technology as **saviors**]{.mark} while at the same time showcasing
environmental protection as the enemy]{.underline} (Livesey, 2002). In
today's world, even Russian companies cannot deny the environmental
impact of the industry, and therefore such claims have dropped the
business rhetoric but retained the idea of [technology as a
savior]{.underline}. The [notion of [competition]{.mark} found in the
research material does [not]{.mark} refer [only]{.mark} to [market
competition]{.mark}, but similarly to the [**competition** for]{.mark}
Arctic **[leadership]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This can be linked to the
world of fame. The companies' websites make frequent references to being
an Arctic leader and refer to the polar explorers of earlier times.
[Equinor actively compares the current explorations for new hydrocarbon
fields with the polar explorers of the early 20th century]{.underline}.
The polar explorers of Norway, already a source of national pride, are
portrayed as "paving the way" for modern explorers like Equinor. Thanks
to a long lasting maritime tradition and experience dealing with harsh
environments, Norway has fostered some of the greatest ocean and polar
explorers in history. Building on a heritage of adventures, Equinor has
become a world-leading explorer for oil and gas. (Equinor, 2019) The
characteristics of early polar explorers, such as "aspirations,
persistence, boldness, creativity and knowledge" (Equinor, 2019), are
crucial for the modern explorer as well. This is notable from a feminist
perspective, as [the celebrated early polar explorers were virtually
always men]{.underline}. [Representations of their deeds stood at the
intersection of "heroic adventure, patriotism, honor and
manliness"]{.underline} (Ryall et al., 2010). Even though the early
polar explorers did not exactly aim to secure the large-scale
utilization of natural resources in the same way as modern hydrocarbon
companies, a certain discourse of conquering the north and nature
already existed. [The idea of **conquering** the Arctic as polar
explorers or [being a **leader**]{.mark} in the region speaks again in
the language of **Anthropocene** and **coloniality**, [ignoring]{.mark}
the possible [harm to nature or]{.mark} the ([indigenous]{.mark}) people
living in the area.]{.underline} [The will to be a leader in the Arctic
hydrocarbon industry refers not only to the actual oil and gas industry
but also to the wider political context within the Arctic.]{.underline}
Both Equinor and Gazprom emphasize being Arctic leaders, especially
Gazprom. No other country in the world has ever created anything like
this in the Arctic. [This project has no precedent]{.underline} in the
history of the global gas industry. By creating a brand new gas
production center beyond the Arctic Circle, Russia has proven its
leadership in the Arctic. (Gazprom, 2019, quoting CEO Alexey Miller)
World of ecology and the presentation of gender The biggest and [most
obvious]{.underline} controversy arising regarding oil and gas
operations has to do with their consequences for the environment via
global emissions. The Russian discourse on climate change has different
expectations for the need to address climate issues than the Norwegian
one, due to widespread climate denialism in Russia (Tynkkynen &
Tynkkynen, 2018). The extent to which the Russian companies choose to
address climate change, however, differs -- Gazprom Neft's material
mentions climate change or manmade environmental impacts in several
instances, while Gazprom's material refers to climate change only
rarely, with the words greenhouse gas or climate protection occurring
just a couple of times. Gazprom Neft's website focuses on global climate
change in certain sections (such as Environment and Prirazlomnaye),
whereas Gazprom discusses local environmental impacts. In contrast,
Equinor addresses climate change throughout its webpages. It responds to
the problem of global emissions by noting its responsibility to provide
energy: "The world needs more energy than renewables can provide"
(Equinor, 2019). Environmental and ecological values recently have
assumed a prominent place in the public sphere due to growing awareness
about climate change. However, the companies rarely address the
ecological world as such. Equinor offers more frequent reflection, with
Gazprom and Gazprom Neft having less to say about their impacts on the
ecological world: Delaying climate action increases the challenge.
Current climate actions are far from enough to put the world on a path
to keep global warming well below 2 degrees. Global emissions increased
in 2018 to reach an all-time high---and the longer this continues, the
stronger measures will be necessary to reach common goals. The need is
ever more urgent for rapid and significant change. (Equinor, 2019)
Gazprom operates both in densely-populated Russian regions and in
pristine areas across Eastern Siberia, the Far East, the Extreme North,
and the Arctic shelf. No matter the region, the Company seeks to
minimize its environmental impacts. (Gazprom, 2019) Gazprom Neft
endeavours to minimise the negative environmental impact of oil
production and refining whilst ensuring its products meet high
ecological standards. (Gazprom Neft, 2019) The global and local aspects
of the Arctic hydrocarbon industry are at the core of these
justifications. Local problems, such as possible oil spills, can be
solved with technology, while global emissions are harder to tackle. The
global effects of climate change are argued to affect women more
drastically than men, due to the larger proportion of women within the
poorest segments of the population globally. Though this claim is not
unproblematic and has been questioned (see, e.g. Arora-Jonsson, 2011),
it sheds light on the unequal effects of global climate change. Another
issue that must be critically assessed as a part of the hydrocarbon
companies' ecological justifications is the ontology of the environment.
At the centre of ecological well-being is often the idea that the
environment provides sustenance and well-being for all people. Such an
anthropocentric worldview tends to ignore, for example, the well-being
of animals. The division between humans and non-humans is deeply rooted
in most contemporary Western worldviews (see, e.g. Haraway, 1991;
Plumwood, 1993). Arctic animals are well represented in the imagery
utilised by the companies, especially by the Russian companies. However,
hydrocarbon companies may well interpret ecological well-being rather
differently than, for instance, what would constitute ecological
well-being for an Arctic codfish. Though each company discuss
sustainability of the industry, the different dimensions of the concept
need to be evaluated in more detail. Lempinen (2019a) has examined
Arctic energy and sustainability and notes that sustainability means
different things when looked at from different angles. Turning her
attention to the fossil fuel industry, Lempinen (2019a, p.31) asks how
can the extraction of something that is finite by nature ever be
sustainable. Furthermore, when the resource extracted is itself
exacerbating the climate crisis, the framing of it as sustainable is
difficult to justify. Ecofeminism, an approach introduced in earlier
scholarship regarding the connections between gender and the
environment, has embraced the natural connection between women and
nature. Though the essentialist nature of this claim has since been
problematized, for example, sustainable consumption decisions have been
linked more strongly to the female gender (see, e.g. Brough et al.,
2016; Oldrup & Breengaard, 2009). I argue that this idea of females
being more connected to nature is utilized in Equinors webpage and in
their rebranding process. The most significant and visible difference
between the material produced by the Norwegian and Russian companies has
to do with the representation of gender. Roughly half of the images on
Equinor's website depicting people working in various capacities are of
(assumed) women. Equinor also includes a more varied group of ethnic
backgrounds within its imagery. In contrast, Gazprom's and Gazprom
Neft's material typically only show women in the corporate social
responsibility sections, or in a few images of office workers. Equinor's
material shows women working in office jobs as well as in the field, and
especially in contexts related to sustainability. One example of
gendered imagery in Equinor's material can be found in the section on
Johan Svedrup, a new flagship production site presented in the
frontpage. An image shows two women (young, white) in working clothes
(with helmets, ear protectors and yellow overalls) looking happy, with
the caption "It's 2019 and climate strikes are taking place the world
over. So why are we so proud of our new oil field?". I argue that the
combination of the image displaying young females in work overalls and
this caption is intentionally meant to assuage and shift perceptions
regarding the traditional high-emission oil industry and help form an
impression of an industry that is truly changing. The story continues
with a description of the project's low level of emissions compared to
global averages in oil production. Gazprom's and Gazprom Neft's
representation of gender is a masculine one: strong (assumed) men
working in harsh conditions. The visual imagery perpetuates a
traditional "oilman" type of masculinity among white men. In addition,
especially Gazprom utilises many images of "important" (male) figures,
such as politicians, signing deals and so forth. A descriptive example
of such imagery can be found in the section of Gazprom Neft's website on
the Messoyakha field and its levels of production, where three men
wearing warm winter clothes and helmets are shown walking in front of
industrial machinery. The text accompanying the picture states that oil
production at the field has increased 30% since 2018, which is due to
technical and geological initiatives. Several pictures on Gazprom's and
Gazprom Neft's websites show men either at a control board or with
machinery, working inside or outside in harsh climate. The imagery fits
the concept of petromachismo (Etkind, 2014) or petro-masculinity
(Daggett, 2018). While both concepts also refer to the connections
between wealth and fossil fuels, the material presents the men as
hardworking workers, which is also connected to the Soviet heritage.
Domestic and civic worlds -- caring for the communities In the local
context, the Arctic hydrocarbon industry can be seen to bring numerous
benefits. The fossil fuel industry plays significant role in the local
level via revenues as well as by providing energy security (see, e.g.
Arctic Council, 2009). Claims based on the domestic world highlight the
benefits the industry brings to the national and local levels. Equinor
emphasises its instrumentality with respect to local communities,
especially in economic terms (domestic-market worth). In many sections
of its website, Equinor focuses on employment, highlighting the tax
revenue Norway is gaining from the industry. The oil and gas industry
creates positive economic ripple effects, not only for the many tens of
thousands of people directly employed by the oil industry, but for all
Norwegians, in the form of significant tax revenues for the state.
(Equinor, 2019) Gazprom attaches great importance to its domestic world
as well, but in a different way. The company's website dedicates much
space to describing the role of the gas distribution system for Russia
and how it provides energy for all areas. Moreover, almost every section
that discusses machinery mentions they are produced in Russia. The gas
distribution system has become an important part of peripheral Russia,
thereafter creating a hierarchical position for the different areas of
Russia (Tynkkynen, 2016). Through its gas distribution system, Gazprom
places more importance on the domestic-civic worth strategy as well,
emphasising the value created for Russia and Russians. This perspective
is also visible in the website's discussion of a new Gazprom Neft
corporate social responsibility program called "Home Towns" (Rodnye
goroda): We operate on the premise that anyone living in a small town
deserves the same quality of environment as someone living in a major
city. For that reason, the approach we take is innovative and unusual:
investing in our"Home Towns," we strive for the highest possible
standards in all projects we undertake---many of which are genuinely
unique in Russia. (Gazprom Neft, 2019) Equinor's justification
strategies, in contrast, focus more strongly on the civic world, since
its justifications are based on the global need for providing energy.
Gazprom and Gazprom Neft also utilise this argument, but not as visibly
as Equinor. Providing energy for the growing population of the world can
be marketed as caring for the people. The companies highlight their
domestic and civic worth by expressing care for the people, though from
a perspective of a hydrocarbon company. Each companies' justifications
rely strongly on Norwegian and Russian laws and regulations. In several
sections, Equinor justifies its role of providing more oil and gas
(especially from the north) for the growing population, while
simultaneously acknowledging the acuteness of climate change. [The
attention given to future generations is not in the context of climate
change, but that of context of energy security]{.underline}. There is
considerable interest in this exploration since many geologists believe
that most of the remaining undiscovered resources on the Norwegian
continental shelf may be right here in the Barents Sea---and could be of
major benefit to future generations of Norwegians, as well as a valuable
source of energy for the world. (Equinor, 2019) In Norway, the
discussion on future generations is topical. Opposition to the
hydrocarbon industry has grown significantly, for example, in the form
of the court case mentioned earlier. Civic world is also present in the
Russian material in relation to indigenous people, with the websites
providing text as well as imagery to address indigenous concerns. In the
Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, both Gazprom and Gazprom Neft [operate
on land that has traditionally provided home and subsistence to
indigenous people. Relationships of power undeniably impact interactions
between a parastatal company and local indigenous peoples]{.underline},
such as the Nenets. Gazprom and Gazprom Neft both briefly discuss
cooperation efforts with indigenous people in the Yamal district. The
story Bovanenkovo stands still letting deer herds pass portrays an image
of indigenous people, reindeer, and the hydrocarbon company currently
coexisting well. While indigenous Sámi people live in northern Norway,
the context of Norwegian hydrocarbon projects being offshore makes their
situation rather different. All three companies foreground the idea of
caring about people and bringing benefits to local communities when
justifying their worth and contribution to the domestic and civic world
domains. In their view, the fossil fuel industry in the Arctic is caring
for the people and their economic security. Conclusions [Continuing to
drill for oil and gas in the Arctic is not a value neutral
decision.]{.underline} The acceleration of climate change and its
implications are already visible -- it is not a future phenomenon. The
image the Arctic hydrocarbon companies produce of their oil and gas
operations as an inevitable and viable operation needs to be challenged.
[The justifications utilised by the companies push for certain
narratives and produce a certain reality]{.underline} in relation to
Arctic fossil fuels. The premise of [continuing oil and gas drilling in
the Arctic arises from the capitalist, patriarchal and anthropocentric
worldview, in which the [earth is understood as resources]{.mark} for
human beings]{.underline}. This paper reveals the dominant
conceptualisations of which the justifications of the Arctic hydrocarbon
companies are based on. In addition, the paper contributes to emerging
discussions on feminist approaches to the Arctic and demonstrates how
the hydrocarbon industry shapes the discussion through gendered
justifications for continued drilling operations. Furthermore, this
article contributes to the growing body of literature on justification
analysis and moreover acknowledges that visual communication is an
important side of justification, making analysis of visual data an
essential part of justification analysis. The "gendered environmental
discourses frame and shape dominant understandings of the issue", notes
MacGregor (2009, p.127), a point clearly supported by the research
findings presented here. In this paper, I drew attention to the gendered
foundations underpinning the justifications and the social constructs of
masculinity and femininity embedded in the narratives promoted by the
three companies. Furthermore, the article demonstrates how the
justifications of Norwegian and Russian actors rely mainly on values
belonging to masculinist conceptualisations of space (Jackman et al.,
2020) and masculine discursive constructs (MacGregor, 2010, 2009), such
as the belief in techno-scientific solutionism or the need for
leadership in the Arctic. The justifications relying mainly on feminine
sets of values are more subtle, but nonetheless present. The
justifications connected to social constructs of femininity include, for
example, caring about the well-being of local communities and providing
energy for future generations. In addition, I have shown that the
justifications utilised by Norwegian and Russian companies are rather
similar, even though the respective countries are quite different. This
reveals a global paradigm shift in the hydrocarbon industry. At least in
terms of public marketing, firms have gone from simply selling oil to
being sustainable energy companies, even, to a certain extent in Russia.
The choice of research material, the webpages focusing on Arctic oil and
gas exploration, set certain premises and limitations for the worlds
discussed throughout the article. The justifications employed on the
company websites do not necessarily reflect the real-life actions being
taken by them to tackle climate change and conduct operations in a
sustainable manner. In real-life terms, the differences between
Norwegian and Russian companies and their carbon footprints are likely
to be greater. In the Russian Arctic, frequent oil spills from the
pipelines, methane emissions and flaring (burning of any "unnecessary"
petroleum gas) occur, yet reliable numbers are impossible to obtain
(Tynkkynen, 2019). In addition, the justifications found on the webpages
of the two Russian companies must be understood as the result of
mounting global public pressure to express accountability for
environmental impacts. If we assume that economic reasons are the actual
drivers of continuing Arctic oil and gas production, then the companies
would not need to utilise other justifications. Furthermore, the
webpages and the public image of the companies are aimed at the general
public, which is not homogeneous. Therefore, several justification
strategies are offered for different audiences. The Arctic is becoming
an increasingly important, yet vulnerable region because of the warming
climate. As feminism and gender have started to work their way into
Arctic discourses, it is increasingly evident that "gender is everywhere
and nowhere at the same time::: but the relevance of socially embedded
gender hierarchies and practices (for example in the economy) is
ignored" (Sinevaara-Niskanen, 2012, cited in Sinevaara-Niskanen, 2015).
As the environmental crisis of our planet accelerates, it is important
to scrutinise the underlying values and ideas behind the practices
actively contributing to the destruction of the planet. However, instead
of focusing merely on gender, the future (feminist) research on Arctic,
extractivism and environment should focus on the intersections and
explorations of identity and nature.

### 2NC\-\--L\-\--Arctic Exploration

#### Struggles over nature and the environment have exposed gender differences or created social structures that employ gender biases, specifically in the "gendered economy" of the Arctic.

Another strand that offers important input to the study of gendered
economies is [[Feminist Political Ecology]{.underline}]{.mark} -- one of
the fields in geography that recently regained attention (Rocheleau,
Thomas-Slayter, & Wangari, Citation2013). It [[emphasizes gendered power
relations in]{.underline}]{.mark} the 'ongoing rounds of
[[accumulation]{.underline}]{.mark}, enclosure and dispossession' [[of
existential resources]{.underline}]{.mark} (Elmhirst, Citation2011, p.
129). Feminist Political Ecology takes its momentum from Gender Studies
to explore the connections between 'nature' and unequal access to its
resources, the formation of a gendered subject, and the body. Of central
interest are the [[gender dimensions of struggles over 'nature' and the
environment]{.underline}]{.mark}, and how their study can contribute to
female empowerment. In the context of Feminist Political Ecology the
[[dominant conceptions of 'nature']{.underline}]{.mark} and knowledge
[[are revealed]{.underline}]{.mark} and questioned in order [[to open
the space for study of marginal perspectives]{.underline}]{.mark} and
[[stakeholders and to offer alternative
epistemologies]{.underline}]{.mark} (Elmhirst, Citation2015). The
conference on 'Gender Asymmetry and Resource Use in the Arctic'
(Uppsala, February 2017), which gave rise to this special issue of Polar
Geography, was inspired by these concerns and theoretical approaches. It
emphasized [[different factors of human-environment
relations]{.underline}]{.mark} and resource politics [[at their
intersection with gender]{.underline}]{.mark}. A goal of the conference
was to reveal the particular ways in which different [[Arctic regions
currently experience gender shifts in]{.underline}]{.mark} the context
of local [[historical, economic and environmental
conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}. Further, we wanted to establish the
global processes that trigger such changes and the diversity of ways in
which they shape them in different localities. Literature on [[gendered
economy in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} has already been mentioned
earlier in this introduction in relation to other phenomena, [[such as
the politics of tradition and identity]{.underline}]{.mark}. As we
pointed out, interest in gendered economy is relatively new in the field
of Arctic Studies, and it is marked by an immanent interest in
intersectionality even when it is not explicitly stated. To be sure,
[[female labor and subsistence activities were studied in previous
decades]{.underline}]{.mark}; but with the [[growing interest in
political leadership]{.underline}]{.mark} there [[is now a
stronger]{.underline}]{.mark}, albeit still implicit, [[attention to the
complexity and intersections between economic activities and other
aspects of life, such as gender, ethnicity, social class and
locality]{.underline}]{.mark}. Hugh Beach's above-mentioned works point
out the gender inequality in Swedish Sámi reindeer herding communities
(Beach, Citation1982, Citation2004, Citation2012, Citation2013,
Citation2015; Beach & Rasmussen, Citation2015) and explicate its
economic aspects (cf. Eikjok, Citation2007; Kuokkanen, Citation2007).
Further [[examination of economic strategies]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[[include]{.mark}]{.underline} but are not limited to [[gendered
relations over time]{.underline}]{.mark}, can be found in the work of
Hovelsrud-Broda and Bodenhorn (Bodenhorn, Citation1988, Citation1993,
Citation1997, Citation2012; Hovelsrud, Poppel, van Oort, & Reist,
Citation2011; Vom Bruck & Bodenhorn, Citation2006). The anthropological
literature on migration in the North also offers insights on how the
privileged development of certain economic branches exerts an immediate
influence on men's and women's life strategies. [[Mineral resource
extraction often creates temporary material and social structures and
relies]{.mark}]{.underline} to a large extent [[on imported labor
force.]{.underline}]{.mark} In Soviet time, industrial migration was
informed by the idea of long-term occupation and generally of
'mastering' and 'civilising' the Arctic wilderness, i.e. in qualitative
transformation. This created social transformations of a scale hardly
experienced before. The increase in mixed marriages and the new
employment possibilities are only a small part of this change, but one
that has not received enough focus in research yet. At present, mine and
oil workers are becoming predominantly short-term immigrants or even
commuters and shift-workers. In some cases, they are residents of
previous Soviet republics in Central Asia and elsewhere, who sustain
their families 'back home'. This phenomenon triggers new social
processes with equally long-term consequences for the residents of
Arctic regions.

[These [masculinist]{.mark} and heroic [narratives persist
today]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Ohio State University glaciologist
Lonnie Thompson, who extracts and studies high-mountain ice cores, for
example, has been described as today's 'Indiana Jones' and 'one of the
true scientific heroes of our age' (Struck, 2006; Krajick, 2002). While
Thompson conscientiously studies ice and works with local communities
(Bowen, 2005), media and popular accounts cast him, regardless of his
actual intentions, as a pioneer explorer, overcoming hardships and
conquering supposedly unknown mountains in distant places. [Most popular
accounts of Thompson -- which often **overlook** the **presence of his
wife**, Ellen Mosley Thompson, a world-renowned ice researcher -- focus
explicitly on his overcoming asthma and a host of other obstacles while
conducting fieldwork.]{.underline} Overcoming personal hardship is also
at the center of the documentary film Chasing Ice (Exposure, 2012), and
its protagonist, the filmmaker photographer James Balog. Instead of
focusing on the glaciers that Balog photographs, the film follows him
and his Extreme Ice Survey into 'treacherous terrain' where Balog
struggles with failing knees, strenuous conditions, falling rocks and
ice, and existential risk to tell the tale of vanishing glaciers.
Balog's assistants even wonder in one scene if they should have stuck to
their office job given [[the risks they face in]{.underline}]{.mark} the
field. Balog may not have chosen this approach, [but the filmmakers and
media **adhere** to [tropes of **masculine vigor**]{.mark}, risk,
adventurous exploration, [and heroic science to attract audiences and
validate research]{.mark}, thereby sustaining these masculinist glacier
narratives into the 21st century.]{.underline}

Thompson and Balog's work is impressive to be sure because collecting
the data they gathered was no easy feat and they are yielding insights
for science and climate change impacts. But [read alongside older
[heroic scientific narratives, the masculinist attributions ascribed to
this type of field science remain prevalent over three
centuries]{.mark}.]{.underline} To be credible, glaciologists, according
to most commentators, still need to be experienced mountain climbers to
overcome high altitude, limited oxygen, cold temperatures, circumscribed
logistical support, and overall rugged working conditions. As Savage
(2015: 396) reports in the journal Nature, 'Young scientists who are
considering a career in ice-core palaeoclimatology ought to have some
experience with climbing, says Doug Hardy of the University of
Massachusetts Amherst, if only to know whether or not they can handle
it.' While Savage recognizes that those without 'the inclination or the
ability to climb glaciers' can find other positions in glaciology, such
as computer modeling, the article's sub-headline ('Climb any mountain:
Glaciology is an outdoors game') certainly does not celebrate these
indoor desk jobs. [Nor does such a [depiction **consider** class
barriers for entry into the field]{.mark}, such as the high costs of
acquiring and maintaining necessary alpine skills. [Alternative
knowledges and practices are **marginalized**]{.mark} in this sustained
[masculinist **atmosphere**, **restricting** scientific
questions]{.mark} asked, practitioners involved, methods employed, sites
studied, and results achieved.]{.underline}

[[**Manliness** in the field]{.mark} thus [makes the science (and
scientist) more credible]{.mark}.]{.underline} A recent feature in the
New York Times follows researchers onto the Greenland ice sheet, for
example, where they race against time and a precarious helicopter,
survive the 'frozen landscape' of this hostile environment, and
altruistically overcome death to get glacier runoff data. As Lincoln
Pitcher was quoted as saying, if his fellow researcher fell into the
river atop the ice sheet, 'the death rate is 100 percent' (Davenport et
al., 2015). [The [article focuses very **little** on the **scientific
questions**]{.mark} asked, or [even the scientific implications]{.mark}
of the study beyond broad claims about glacier shrinkage and sea level
rise.]{.underline} It focuses instead on the processes of doing
glaciological science, not the science itself. Yet New York Times
coverage for these researchers -- especially the graduate student at the
center of it -- can significantly enhance a career. [In this way, the
portrayal of [masculinist researchers in the media]{.mark} (because that
is what sells, presumably) can [shape scientific credibility]{.mark} in
the academy, such as with [hiring and possibly even with peer
reviewing]{.mark}. Being a pioneer, being first, enduring physical
hardship, risking death, overcoming wild nature -- in short, being as
manly as the Victorian mountaineer-glaciologists were more than a
century ago -- continues to influence scientists' credibility, or on the
other side, [their lack of credibility for those who cannot pitch their
research through such masculinist frameworks.]{.mark}]{.underline}

V Systems of scientific domination

Feminist glaciology builds on feminist postcolonial science studies and
feminist political ecology to understand how gender, power, and
inequality are embedded in systems of scientific domination
(Schiebinger, 2014). Such power structures maintain glaciology as a
discipline concentrated in the wealthy developed world, often termed the
Global North, with generally weak institutional representation from the
developing world or indigenous communities. [This [pattern exists for
global climate simulations]{.mark} in general, which are [conducted by
European and North American scientists]{.mark} with little to no
representation from Central and South America, Africa, the Middle
East,]{.underline} or South Asia (Edwards, 2011). The feminist lens is
crucial for effective analysis of what might look on the surface like
postcolonial or hegemonic structures of development[. But global power
imbalances and gender inequality co-constitute each other -- and the
natural sciences and glaciology in particular. **[Current climate change
discussions]{.mark}**, for example, [**perpetuate power discrepancies**
through]{.mark} what Israel and Sachs (2013: 34--5) refer to as 'the
centrality of mathematical and technological science \...structured by
masculinist ideologies of domination and mastery', thus [**determining**
who can or cannot **participate** in climate science and
policy-making]{.mark}.]{.underline} Such institutional, cultural, and
scientific practices also affect glaciological knowledge. While there
are, on paper, few recognized glaciologists from the Global South (for
exceptions see Carey, 2010), such recognition is predicated upon a
specific type of knowledge production that is restricted to a group of
scientists who often cannot be divorced from larger processes of
colonialism, imperialism, patriarchy, and capitalist resource
extraction.

Questions of who produces glaciological knowledge, and how such
knowledge is used or shared, take on real implications when considered
through feminist postcolonial science studies and feminist political
ecology lenses. [Specifically, [the feminist approach opens up
**marginalized** knowledge]{.mark} and [exposes]{.mark} how larger
[structures of domination]{.mark} have worked [historically to
**suppress** certain voices]{.mark}. It [reveals]{.mark} how
[people]{.mark} across the planet [have been living with glaciers for
centuries]{.mark} and have [produced]{.mark} wide ranges of
[glaciological knowledge -- **folk glaciology**]{.mark} -- that is
[rarely recognized within the scientific discipline]{.mark} of modern
glaciology.]{.underline} We use the term 'folk glaciology' to refer to
significant glacier-oriented knowledges produced at different times and
places by diverse peoples, cultures, and social groups.

For instance, in Canada's Yukon Territory[, glacier knowledge of elder
indigenous women has both a gendered context and offers alternative
visions of ice compared to Western sciences]{.underline}. Cruikshank
(2005) explains for Northwest North America that knowledge of the
landscape is influenced profoundly by culture, gender, age, and the
personal experiences of each individual living with glaciers.
Additionally, whereas glaciologists may try to measure glaciers and
understand ice physics by studying the glacial ice itself, indigenous
accounts do not portray the ice as passive, to be measured and mastered
in a stereotypically masculinist sense. '[The [glaciers]{.mark} these
[women speak of']{.mark}, explains Cruikshank (2005: 51--3), '[engage
all the senses.]{.mark} \[The glaciers\] are willful, capricious, easily
excited by human intemperance, but equally placated by quick-witted
human responses. Proper behavior is deferential[. I was warned,]{.mark}
for instance, about [firm taboos against ''cooking with grease'' near
glaciers]{.mark} that are offended by such smells. \...[Cooked food,
especially fat, might grow into a glacier overnight if improperly
handled.]{.mark}]{.underline}' The narratives Cruikshank collected show
how humans and nature are intimately linked, and subsequently
demonstrate the capacity of [[folk glaciologies to **diversify** the
field of glaciology and subvert the **hegemony** of natural
sciences]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### The 1AC reenacts imperial masculinity---its Arctic framing mirrors conquest narratives that cast the region as a proving ground for heroic men, erasing feminist and nonviolent alternatives.

In providing her critique of masculinist knowledge projects with Arctic
bookends, Mary Shelley not only underlines women's exclusion from such
projects but also draws our attention once again [to how [Arctic]{.mark}
space, although geographically peripheral, [was]{.mark} understood as [a
place for British self-realization]{.mark}.]{.underline} Robert Walton's
appetite for discovery is set in motion when as a youth he reads
exploration accounts in his uncle's library. As a result he believes
[that [the Arctic will be a place where]{.mark}, if he "put\[s\] some
trust in preceding navigators," "[snow and frost are banished]{.mark}"
and he will be wafted to "a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty
every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe]{.underline}."
Work by Mary-Louise Pratt and others has made visible the way travel
writing produced "the rest of the world" for European readerships," and
in turn how the resulting narratives produced the origin and originators
of the journey by expressing and perpetuating the cultural mores,
biases, and behaviors of the explorers. Yet authors and readers of
exploration accounts understood this early on as well; in 1710 the Earl
of Shaftesbury observed of [[voyage narratives]{.mark} that they
[were]{.mark} "in our present days what [books of **chivalry**]{.mark}
were in those of our forefathers." Voyage narratives, like earlier books
of chivalry, [outlined and historicized codes of **gendered heroic
behavior**]{.mark} that then performed local functions.]{.underline}
When Walton's discovery of Victor Frankenstein and the monster in a
frozen, hostile Arctic coincides with the mutiny of Walton's crew and
the failure of his mission, the texts Walton trusts are shown to be
faulty[. Shelley suggests that [their lie encompasses]{.mark} both
[polar geography and the "heroic" males who produce and document that
geography in exploration accounts.]{.mark}]{.underline}

\[paragraphs ommitted\]

The title of [[Markham]{.mark}'s first book, In Franklin's Footsteps,
[indicates his sens]{.mark}e of his own genealogy and trajectory [as a
heroic explorer, citizen, and author]{.mark}]{.underline}. Later, as
president of the Royal Geographic Society, Markham was responsible for
sponsoring Robert Scott's Antarctic expedition of 1901; that Scott, like
Franklin, would die on a polar mission closes the circuit[. [The
chronological torch-passing]{.mark} from Barrow to Franklin to Markham
to Scott [reveals polar genealogy to be **entirely
male**]{.mark},]{.underline} and not surprisingly the [narratives of
national identity produced there privilege male national
participation]{.underline}. Building on gendering of Arctic experience
explored by Southey, Franklin, Mary Shelley, Eleanor Porden, and Jane
Austen in the early century, mid-century discussions of the Franklin
expedition and the homosocial nature of Arctic exploration addressed
fears of female contamination associated with both colonial spaces and
British domesticity.[26 [The Arctic itself was gendered male:
unforgiving, but constant]{.mark}, a geography that corresponded to an
ideal and thus would bring out the best in the men who mapped
it.]{.underline}As a result[, [the Arctic could produce a British male
**separate from** the moral space of British domesticity]{.mark} so
clearly [associated with **female authority**]{.mark}]{.underline}. When
Sarah Stickney Ellis famously claimed moral primacy for women in The
Women of England (1839), she situated the civilizing forces of religion,
education, and gentle manners in middle-class women. [While early
century exploration had participated in the re-masculinization of public
culture, the masculinist fantasy of mid-century Arctic exploration
promised to reappropriate domestic and private authority to males and
the public sphere.]{.underline}

But as Morley's hyperbole and Franklin's own experience on his first
mission indicate, there are dangers in locating authority in an overly
embodied national masculinity: any failure of Franklin and the men of
the Erebus and Terror was a failure of British character. [Perhaps the
Arctic, rather than being proving ground to and evidence of a British
male uniquely suited to dominating the natural world and other
countries, instead points out his limit.]{.underline} It follows that
the [[national obsession]{.mark} [with]{.mark} discovering the bodies of
Franklin and his [men]{.mark} was as much [driven by a desire to find
**the heroic masculinity**]{.mark} understood to [have been forged by
polar exploration]{.mark} as it was by curiosity about the men's
fates]{.underline}. As such, the human bodies---first thought to be
living, later widely accepted as dead---that were the object of almost
thirty years of search expeditions had a metonymic relation to Britain's
imperial endeavors, part of a metonymic chain that extended to Britons
at home. Not only did

[Franklin himself embody a national masculinity that was then deployed
at home]{.underline}, but the libraries of sermons, working pipe organs,
and fine crystal listed on the expedition manifest were the same
material posses- sions found in middle-class sitting rooms.

5.4 Discussion

The language used throughout the years has shown to become more
inclusive of the general public. As Song (2015) noted, [the analogical
comparison]{.underline} of the BRI [to a 'Trojan horse' is an effective
means to demonstrate and construct [the image of China as **threatening
and malicious**]{.mark} to a wider audience. The analogy]{.underline} of
the BRI as being a 'Trojan horse' [[can have many implications]{.mark}.
[The]{.mark} perception, or **[misperception]{.mark}**, of the
ideological 'Trojan horse' threat China poses may [lead to a
**self-fulfilling prophecy** as]{.mark} their [containment
policies]{.mark} can [drive]{.mark} or push [China toward]{.mark}
**initiating more [expansionist policies]{.mark}**. This self-fulfilling
prophecy also risks the escalation of securitizing discourse [leading to
a Thucydides trap]{.mark}]{.underline}, as mentioned in chapter 2.2. As
Ambrosio et al (2020: 189) have observed, [there is **little
acknowledgement** from the US and the role it had in either causing the
rise of China or engaging in a 'grand strategy which has led to
overextension and imperial decline.]{.underline}'; this also coincides
with Almén et al's (2021) findings that [[China views the US as
**increasingly antagonistic**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The strategic aspects outlined by Chengqiu (2020) and the identity the
US holds of itself could explain why they view China as an existential
threat. Ideologically, [[the US' identity is **tied to**]{.mark} it not
only [being the leader]{.mark} of the liberal and democratic world, but
also using its position to spread those ideals to other countries. Many
wars have been fought over the containment of communism,
[therefore]{.mark} there is an aspect of the US being
**[overreaching]{.mark}** that [is **objectively
true**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The vehement opposition to communism and
authoritarianism combined with the US identity of aspiring to transform
other countries into democracies has [led to the reproduction of the
**interior/exterior binary**]{.mark}. The 'spreading of democracy' along
with the interior/exterior resonates well with the American public,
therefore [there is **not much resistance** in viewing China as an
**existential threat**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

One of the main points of discord amongst scholars and researchers is
the idea of China exercising a debt trap strategy via the BRI. It is
apparent the individuals chosen in the analysis agree that China is
utilizing a debt trap strategy, which coincides with what Almén et al
(2021) say is contributing to a tributary system. If allowed to
continue, China will reinforce unequal power relations in BRI countries,
which can then be interpreted as a form of neocolonialism.

[While the economic and military sectors have been securitized, the
analysis showed the political sectors also being
securitized]{.underline}, albeit in a latent manner. [The [**ideological
differences** serve to securitize]{.mark} the political sector and it
can be argued the societal sector as well. The **perception** of China's
expansionist policies create anxieties about cultural and societal
expansion as well.]{.underline} As seen in 5.3.3, there are worries
concerning the degradation of workers' rights and labor practices that
China could introduce to BRI participating countries which could shift
the states to mirror China and become more authoritarian. If we alter
and broaden the scope of Chengqiu's (2020: 35) American strategic aspect
of 'integrating China into the Western-dominated international economic
system' to not be limited to the international economic system and to
also include BRI participating countries, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
interior/exterior [[binary]{.underline}]{.mark} is even more relevant.
It is perceived that if China is allowed to exercise their influence
over BRI countries, the interior politics of a country will reflect
Chinese practices and ideologies which are directly opposite of the US.
This [[can]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[raise anxieties about **national
security**]{.mark} as if China is allowed to expand its influence, other
states may participate in, for example, **cyber security attacks**
against the US.]{.underline}

6\. Conclusion

The hegemonic position held by America and its position in the
international system as a dominant state is central to its identity. As
Fukuyama's (1989) article noted, [the collapse of the Soviet Union
shaped American identity as a global hegemon]{.underline}, an example of
them as a leading Western liberal and democratic state, and a state
which aims to spread liberal and democratic values. [The US perceives
its hegemonic position, therefore its **core identity**, as being
threatened by China.]{.underline} The previous subsections have
demonstrated how there has been a rise in securitizing discourse
regarding the BRI which affects multiple sectors, not solely the
economic and military sectors. The analysis also demonstrates the role
that [conflicting ideologies play in **securitizing speech acts**.
While]{.underline} explicitly [stating that China is]{.underline} using
the BRI to actively spread \[[spreading]{.underline}\] [its
authoritarian and communist values]{.underline} in the economic sector,
[the analysis shows how the **[perceived ideological expansion]{.mark}**
and perceived threats further [contribute to]{.mark} the securitization
of China and [the **construction of the 'China
threat'**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The securitization of China is in no way a new and untouched subject of
study, however, the use of poststructuralism has been underutilized. The
aim of this thesis was to explore how securitization regarding the BRI
also includes differences in ideologies and perceptions, as ample
research has mainly focused on the economic, military, and strategic
elements. The use of Fairclough's three-dimensional model along with the
theoretical framework developed by Hansen has been used to highlight the
[perceptional and ideological differences which play key roles in the
securitization of China. It also reveals the latent power relations and
how the [discourse]{.mark} by US elites **[reproduces]{.mark} these
[unequal power relations]{.mark}hips**.]{.underline} The method and
theoretical framework were chosen to explore how historical context and
social contexts at a specific period in time affect speech acts. The
articles reviewed mainly focus on the economic and military sectors, and
while this is acknowledged to play a substantial role, the ideological
differences have shown to also securitize the political and societal
sectors as well. The inclusion of more sectors provides a more robust
and deeper understanding of the securitization process and how it
contributes to the further securitization of China. The addition of
poststructuralism contributes to the security field by emphasizing
different ontologies and epistemologies, which only serves to deepen the
understanding of the securitization process and if it will be successful
or not. It also allows us to understand why [US-Sino [relations have
been **strained**]{.mark}]{.underline} and how this
\[[[which]{.underline}]{.mark}\] [[can affect the current international
system]{.mark} dominated by Western liberal and democratic
concepts]{.underline}.

The guiding argument was that differences in ideologies and perceptions
contribute to the securitization of China. In the analysis, [we can
clearly note the increase in securitizing language being utilized by
political elites]{.underline} over the years. This may be due to the
change in the presidency or the fact that the BRI was implemented over a
longer period, nonetheless, [there is a clear correlation in how the
**discourse** has framed China as a threat]{.underline} in a more
obvious way. The language has also reflected the rising inclusion of the
general public. The historical construction of the American identity in
the international system has been shown to contextualize how their
identity being threatened plays a more considerable role in why there is
an escalation of securitizing discourse. Securitizing the BRI, therefore
further securitizing China as a whole, is advantageous to the US as
these efforts will assist in preserving the current status quo,
therefore retaining their unipolar and hegemonic identity.

#### This shapes how you understand every word the 1AR and 2AR says. The China threat is fake. It is only a construction by an [echo chamber]{.underline} of racist think tank operatives and US allies\-\--it's a [self-fulfilling prophecy]{.underline} that [increases militarization]{.underline}.

[[War]{.mark}: What [is]{.mark} it [good for]{.mark}? Apparently, in
Washington's world of think tanks, [the]{.mark} answer is: **the [bottom
line]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In fact, as the Biden presidency
approaches, [an era of [great-power competition]{.mark} between the
United States and China [is]{.mark} already [taken for
granted]{.mark}]{.underline} inside the Washington Beltway. [Much less
well known are the financial [incentives]{.mark} that [lurk]{.mark}
[behind]{.mark} so many of the voices clamoring for an
**[ever-more-militarized response]{.mark}** to China in the
Pacific.]{.underline} We're talking about groups that carefully avoid
the problems such an approach will provoke when it comes to the real
security of the United States or the planet. A new cold war is likely to
be dangerous and costly in an America gripped by a pandemic, its
infrastructure weakened, and so many of its citizens in dire economic
straits[. Still, [for]{.mark} foreign lobbyists, Pentagon contractors,
and Washington's many influential [think tanks,]{.mark} a "**[rising
China" means]{.mark} only one thing: [rising profits]{.mark}**. Defense
[contractors]{.mark} [and]{.mark} foreign [governments]{.mark} are
[spend]{.mark}ing [millions]{.mark} of dollars annually funding
establishment think tanks (sometimes in secret) in ways [that]{.mark}
will help [set the foreign-policy agenda]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
Biden years. In doing so[, they gain a distinctly unfair
advantage]{.underline} when it comes to influencing that policy,
especially which future tools of war this country should invest in and
how it should use them. [Not surprisingly, many of the top [think tank
recipients of foreign funding are]{.mark} also **top [recipients]{.mark}
of funding** [from]{.mark} this country's major [weapons makers]{.mark}.
The result: an ecosystem in which those **giant [outfits]{.mark}** and
some of the countries that will use their weaponry now play major roles
in **[bankrolli]{.mark}ng the creation of the very [rationales
for]{.mark} those future [sales]{.mark}**. It's a remarkably closed
system that works like a dream if you happen to be a giant weapons firm
or a major think tank. Right now, that system is helping
[a**ccelerate**]{.mark} **the further [militarization of the]{.mark}
whole [Indo-Pacific]{.mark}** region]{.underline}. In the Pacific,
[Japan finds itself facing an increasingly tough set of choices when it
comes to its most significant military alliance]{.underline} (with the
United States) and its most important economic partnership (with China).
[A growing US presence in the region aimed at counterbalancing China
will allow Japan to remain officially neutral, even as it reaps the
benefits of both partnerships. To walk that tightrope (along with the
defense contractors that will benefit financially from the further
militarization of the region), [Japan spends heavily to influence
thinking]{.mark} in Washington]{.underline}. Recent reports from the
Center for International Policy's Foreign Influence Initiative (FITI),
where the authors of this piece work, reveal just how
[countries]{.underline} like Japan and [giant arms firms like Lockheed
Martin and Boeing functionally purchase an inside track on a think tank
market that's hard at work creating future foreign-policy
options]{.underline} for this country's elite. HOW TO MAKE A THINK TANK
THINK [Take the prominent think tank the Center for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS), which houses programs focused on the
"China threat" and East Asian "security." Its Asia Maritime Transparency
Initiative, which gets funding from the governments of [Japan]{.mark}
and the Philippines, welcomes contributions "from all governments in
Asia, as well as corporate and foundation support."]{.underline}
Unsurprisingly, the program also paints a picture of Japan as central
"to preserving the liberal international order" in the face of the
dangers of an "increasingly assertive China." It highlights that
country's role as Washington's maritime security partner in the region.
There's no question that Japan is indeed an important ally of
Washington[. Still, positioning its government [as a linchpin]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} the international [peace]{.mark} (or war) process [seems a
dubious proposition]{.mark} at best. CSIS is anything but alone when it
comes to the moneyed interests pushing Washington to invest ever more in
what now passes for "security" in the Pacific region. A [FITI report on
Japanese operations]{.mark} in the United States, for instance, [reveals
at least 3,209 lobbying activities]{.mark} in 2019 alone, as various
lobbyists hired by that country and registered under the Foreign Agents
Registration Act targeted both Congress and think tanks like CSIS on
behalf of the Japanese government. Such firms, in fact, raked in more
than \$30 million from that government last year alone. From 2014 to
2019, Japan was also the largest East Asian donor to the top 50 most
influential US think tanks. The results of such investments have been
obvious when it comes to both the products of those think tanks and
congressional policies]{.underline}. Think-tank recipients of Japanese
funding are numerous and, because that country is such a staunch ally of
Washington, its government can be more open about its activities than is
typical. Projects like the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace's
"China Risk and China Opportunity for the U.S.-Japan Alliance," funded
by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, are now the norm inside the
Beltway. [You won't be surprised to learn that the [think tank
scholars]{.mark} working on such projects almost inevitably end up
[highlight]{.mark}ing [Japan's integral role in countering "the China
threat]{.mark}" in the influential studies they produce. **[That threat
itself, of course, is rarely questioned. Instead, its dangers and the
need to confront them are invariably reinforced.]{.mark}**]{.underline}
Another Carnegie Endowment study, "Bolstering the Alliance Amid China's
Military Resurgence," is typical in that regard[. It's [filled with
warnings about China's]{.mark} growing [military]{.mark} power---[never
mind that,]{.mark} in 2019, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
**[spent]{.mark}** nearly **[triple]{.mark} what China did on its
military**, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute. Like so many similarly funded projects inside the Beltway,
this one recommended further growth in military cooperation between the
United States and Japan. Important as well, it claimed, was developing
"the capability to wage combined multidomain joint operations" which
"would require accelerating operational response times to enhance
firepower."]{.underline} The Carnegie project lists its funding and, as
it turns out, that foundation has taken in at least \$825,000 from Japan
and approximately the same amount from defense contractors and US
government sources over the past six years. And Carnegie's
recommendations recently came to fruition when the Trump administration
announced the second-largest sale of US weaponry to Japan, worth more
than \$23 billion worth. If the Japanese government has a stake in
funding such think tanks to get what it wants, so does the defense
industry. The top 50 think tanks have received more than \$1 billion
from the US government and defense contractors over those same six
years. Such contractors alone lobby Congress to the tune of more than
\$20 million each election cycle. Combine such sums with Japanese
funding (not to speak of the money spent by other governments that
desire policy influence in Washington) and you have a confluence of
interests that propels US military expenditures and the sale of weapons
globally on a mind-boggling scale. A DEFENSE BUILD-UP IS THE ORDER OF
THE DAY An April 2020 report on the "Future of US-Japan Defense
Collaboration" by the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft Center for Strategy
and Security offers a typical example of how such pro-militarization
interests are promoted. That report, produced in partnership with the
Japanese embassy, begins with the premise that "the United States and
Japan must accelerate and intensify their long-standing military and
defense-focused coordination and collaboration." Specifically, it urges
the United States to "take measures to incentivize Japan to work with
Lockheed Martin on the F-2 replacement program," known as the F-3. (The
F-2 Support Fighter is the jet Lockheed developed and produced in
partnership with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for the Japanese Defense
Forces.) While the report does acknowledge its partnership with the
embassy of Japan, it fails to acknowledge that Lockheed donated three
quarters of a million dollars to the influential Atlantic Council
between 2014 and 2019 and that Japan generally prefers to produce its
own military equipment domestically. The Atlantic Council report
continues to recommend the F-3 as the proper replacement for the F-2,
"despite political challenges, technology-transfer concerns," and
"frustration from all parties" involved. This recommendation comes at a
time when Japan has increasingly sought to develop its own defense
industry. Generally speaking, no matter the Japanese embassy's support
for the Atlantic Council, that country's military is eager to develop a
new stealth fighter of its own without the help of either Lockheed
Martin or Boeing. While both companies wish to stay involved in the
behemoth project, the Atlantic Council specifically advocates only for
Lockheed, which just happens to have contributed more than three times
what Boeing did to that think tank's coffers. [A 2019 report by the
Hudson Institute on the Japan-US alliance echoed similar sentiments,
outlining a security context in which Japan and the United States should
focus continually on deterring "aggression by China." To do so, the
report suggested, American-made ground-launched missiles (GCLMs) were
one of several potential weapons Japan would need in order to prepare a
robust "defense" strategy against China]{.underline}. Notably, the first
American GCLM test since the United States withdrew from the Cold War
era Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 2019 used a Lockheed
Martin Mark 41 Launch System and Raytheon's Tomahawk Land Attack Cruise
Missile. The Hudson Institute had not only received at least \$270,000
from Japan between 2014 and 2018, but also a minimum of \$100,000 from
Lockheed Martin. In 2020, CSIS organized an unofficial working group for
industry professionals and government officials that it called the CSIS
Alliance Interoperability Series to discuss the development of the
future F-3 fighter jet. While Japanese and American defense contractors
fight for the revenue that will come from its production, the think tank
claims that American, Japanese, and Australian industry representatives
and officials will "consider the political-military and technical issues
that the F-3 debate raises." Such working groups are far from rare and
offer think tanks incredible access to key decision-makers who often
happen to be their benefactors as well. All told, between 2014 and 2019,
CSIS received at least \$5 million from the US government and Pentagon
contractors, including at least \$400,000 from Lockheed Martin and more
than \$200,000 from Boeing. In this fashion, a privileged think-tank
elite has cajoled its way into the inner circles of policy formation
(and it matters little whether we're talking about the Trump
administration or the future Biden one). [Think about it for a moment:
**Possibly [the most crucial relationship on the planet]{.mark}**
between what looks like a rising and a falling great power (in a world
that desperately needs their cooperation) [is **being**
]{.mark}**significantly [influenced]{.mark}** [by]{.mark} experts and
[officials **invested in the industry guaranteed to militarize that very
relationship and create a** ]{.mark}**21st century version of the [Cold
War.]{.mark}** Any [administration]{.mark}, in other words, **[lives
in]{.mark} something like [an echo chamber]{.mark}** [that]{.mark}
continually [affirms]{.mark} the need for a **yet [greater defense
build-up]{.mark} led by those who would gain most from
it.**]{.underline} PROFITING FROM GREAT POWER COMPETITION [Japan is
singled out in this analysis because the Center for International
Policy's Foreign Influence Transparency Initiative, where we work, had
striking access to its influence data. There are, however, [many other
nations]{.mark} [with]{.mark} defense [agendas]{.mark} in the
Indo-Pacific region who act similarly. As a Norwegian think tank
document put it, "Funding powerful think tanks is one way to gain such
access, and some think tanks in Washington are openly conveying that
they can service only those foreign governments that provide
funding.]{.underline}" A Japanese official publicly noted that such
funding of US think tanks "is an investment." You can't put it much more
bluntly or accurately than that. [Foreign [governments]{.mark} and the
defense industry [debate]{.mark} the nitty-gritty of how best to arm a
region whose continued [militarization]{.mark} is accepted [as a
given]{.mark}. The need to stand up to the [Chinese "aggressor" is a
foregone conclusion]{.mark} of most thought leaders in Washington. [They
ought]{.mark}, of course, [to]{.mark} be [weigh]{.mark}ing and debating
**[the entire security picture]{.mark}**, [including]{.mark} the
**potential future [devastation of climate
change]{.mark}**,]{.underline} rather than simply piling yet more
weaponry atop the outdated tools of war. To be sure, [[think
tanks]{.mark} don't make US foreign policy, nor do foreign lobbyists and
defense contractors. But their [money]{.mark}, distributed in copious
amounts, does [buy them crucial seats at that]{.mark} policymaking
[table]{.mark}, **while dissenters are generally left out in the
cold.**]{.underline} What's the solution? For starters, a little
transparency in Washington foreign-policy-making circles would be useful
so that the public can be made more aware of the conflicts of interest
that rule the roost when it comes to China policy. All think tanks
should be required to publicly disclose their donors and funders. At
least the Atlantic Council and CSIS report their funders by levels of
donations and note certain sponsors of events or reports (a basic level
of transparency that makes a piece like this possible). Such a standard
of transparency should minimally be practiced by all think tanks,
including prominent organizations like the American Enterprise Institute
and the Earth Institute, neither of which releases any information about
its funders, to highlight potential conflicts of interests. Without
transparency, [the defense contractors and foreign governments that
donate to think tanks help create foreign-policy thinking in which this
world is, above all**, in constant need of more weapons systems**.
[This]{.mark} only **[increases military tensions globally,]{.mark}**
while helping [to perpetuate the interests and profits of a defense
industry]{.mark} that is, in truth, antithetical to the interests of
most Americans, so many of whom would prefer diplomatic, peaceful, and
coordinated solutions to the challenges of a rising China.]{.underline}
Unfortunately, as foreign policy is now made, a rising China is also
guaranteed to lift all boats (submarines, aircraft carriers, and surface
ships) as well as fighter planes aiding the military-industrial complex
on a planet increasingly at war with itself.

Introduction

[Underlying Russia\'s rejection of "the West" and the deteriorating
relations between these two political entities in recent years, there
lie multiple drivers.]{.underline} Russian domestic politics and the
changing approach of the Kremlin are at the heart of many explanations
(Grigas 2016; McFaul 2018; Taylor 2018). Other accounts emphasize how
deteriorating Russia--West relations are somehow the result of a mutual
process (Legvold 2014; Mearsheimer 2014; Charap and Colton 2017; Conradi
2017; Monaghan 2019). This article can be placed in the latter school;
it shows how what some call [[the]{.mark} [**"new Cold War"** has
developed]{.mark} out of interaction [between Russia and the
West]{.mark}]{.underline}, bringing these political entities into a
relation where [the threat of [war appears
**imminent**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It does so by investigating the dyad
of Russia--West relations, which was particularly benign and where
military hostilities seemed highly unlikely for twenty-five years
following the end of the Cold War.

Focusing on the changing relations between Norway and Russia, I show how
rising tension spread from the 2014 crises in Ukraine to the North.1
Initially, both parties declared that they neither wanted nor believed
that the new strategic tension between Russia and the West would spread
to or define relations in this region. This was not surprising. [[Norway
and Russia]{.mark} had managed to build a close and practical
partnership in the North [following the end of the Cold
War]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Relations]{.underline} in the region
[[had]{.mark} been characterized as]{.underline} pervaded by a spirit of
cooperation and [[a **"culture of compromise"**]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Hønneland and Jensen 2015). [However]{.underline}, by October 2018,
[**NATO** was conducting "Trident Juncture,"]{.underline} the largest
military [exercise]{.underline} since the Cold War on Norwegian
territory, with twenty-nine NATO countries participating, as well as
Finland and Sweden, involving 50,000 troops in all.2 [While this
exercise was underway, Russia unexpectedly announced that it would
conduct missile tests in the Norwegian Sea simultaneously]{.underline}.3
Few could deny that the new Russia--West tensions had spread to the
North. [Although the Norwegian authorities were **reluctant** to
identify Russia as a "threat" for an entire year after the annexation of
Crimea, [**today** they **openly** speak of and prepare for
**hostilities**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Russia, for its part, recently
claimed that Norway has become "the frontier of deterrence of Russia" in
the policy plans of the United States and NATO.4

This development will be explained with reference to [[changing Russian
and Norwegian representations]{.underline}]{.mark} of each other:
[toward **[construing the other]{.mark}**]{.underline} part [**more [as
a threat]{.mark}** than a **partner**]{.underline} in one issue-area,
the rippling outward of this representation to other issue-areas, the
policy changes effectuated in line with these shifting representations,
and how these changes have been (re-)acted upon by the other side.
Within such a process of mutual and multifaceted securitization,
attention to domestic audiences, quests for internal unity, and coherent
identity articulation in volatile times send signals of offense and
non-recognition across the border to the foreign state
audience---playing into a mutual blame game, shaping interaction, and
further escalating tensions to the point where the threat of hostilities
seems imminent. As long acknowledged by security-dilemma theorists, both
the classical realist and newer constructivist proponents, interaction
has a dynamics of its own (Herz 1950; Jervis 1978; Mitzen 2006; Booth
and Wheeler 2008). I argue that [[the emerging and mutual
pattern]{.mark} of representing the other as a threat, not only in the
military sphere, but also across issue-areas, [has become an
**"autonomous" driver of conflict**]{.mark}---[**regardless** of
whether]{.mark}]{.underline} either side
(Norway/**[[NATO]{.mark}/West]{.underline}**, [[and]{.mark}
**[Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline}) [might [originally]{.mark} have [had
offensive designs]{.mark} on the other]{.underline}.5

By invoking the new Cold War in this article, I do not intend to measure
the level of threat and distribution of power between the parties or
suggest that these are the same as in the old Cold War. This article
does not speak to the recent discussion on the similarities and
differences between the old and the new Cold Wars (Legvold 2016; Lieven
2018). Rather, I put the spotlight on the mutual and evolving social
identification processes between political entities that can help to
push a relation to the point where an outbreak of hostilities seems
imminent. Just as during the Cold War, [the parties today hold
**increasingly and mutually incompatible descriptions of self and
other**]{.underline} (Ringmar 2002) [and focus on blaming each
other]{.underline} (Legvold 2016). I believe **[[the totalizing "blame
game"]{.underline}]{.mark}** now underway and the mutual and
intensifying descriptions of the other, [metastasizing to a level [where
the other stands out as an **"existential threat"**]{.mark} at every
encounter, [are central to understanding the **unlikely return** of high
military tension in the North]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Drawing on a detailed study of Russian and Norwegian official texts in
the years following the annexation of Crimea in 2014, and applying a
discourse-theoretical approach to securitization theory, this article
offers two theoretical contributions to second-generation securitization
theory post-Copenhagen School (Balzacq 2005; Stritzel 2007; McDonald
2008; Salter 2008; Floyd 2010; Hagmann 2015; Wilhelmsen 2017; Stengel
2019, building on Wæver 1994 and 1996; Buzan et al. 1998). First, I
propose that securitization processes should be understood and studied
in dyads because the shift to more radical representations of the
other---i.e., a higher degree of securitization---often unfolds in a
mutual pattern of identification and interaction between political
entities. Second, an issue-specific securitization---say, representing
the other part as an existential threat in the military domain---may
spread to other dimensions of the relationship, making the other part
appear as different and dangerous at every encounter. [[Such]{.mark}
multifaceted [securitization can intensify a **negative
spiral**]{.mark}, ultimately [blocking]{.mark} the chances for
[positive]{.mark} mutual representation and [recognition]{.mark}.
[Military]{.mark} [means]{.mark} then [become a]{.mark} logical and
[legitimate way of relating to the other]{.mark}]{.underline}: contact
and collaboration in other issue-areas are precluded. With this
approach, I seek to expand on and integrate a discourse-theoretical
version of securitization theory into the study of how
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} why **[[relations escalate to]{.mark} the
brink of [war]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Conceptualizing Russophobia

As Time magazine's person of the year in 2007, Vladimir Putin took the
opportunity to publicly address the negative views of Russia that exist
in the West, accusing "some" Americans of perpetuating false view of
Russians as "a little bit savage still or they just climbed down from
the trees, you know, and probably need to have their hair brushed or
their beards trimmed. And have the dirt washed out of their beards and
hair. That's the civilizing mission to be accomplished."14 Though
Putin's characterization may be somewhat extreme, Russophobia is well
documented in Russia, with politicians and analysts giving voice to this
phenomenon and its influences on policy makers. However, much less has
been written on Russophobia in English, and for Western audiences. But
[if we ever hope [to truly understand]{.mark} the many facets of the
[Russia]{.mark}-US relationship, [we must consider the ways]{.mark} in
which **[attitudes]{.mark}** toward Russia may be **[influenc]{.mark}ing
American [decision making]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[**Western characterizations** of Putin are that he is an evil dictator,
abusing democracy, human rights and the rule of law, bent upon
re-drawing Europe's map, asserting Russia's influence and balancing
against American power at every turn]{.underline}. This characterization
of Russia's president is reflected in a 2009 Economist article in which
Putin was said to be looking for a war with the West, having "tantrums"
over controversial disagreements in the Middle East and Georgia,
"stumbling" into disputes with the West, and driven by "paranoia" and
"encirclement."15 While some of these criticisms of Putin may not be
entirely unreasonable, there is more to such critiques of Putin than
simply policy disagreement. [An inherent mistrust of Russia and of
Russians themselves, has colored western, and especially American, views
about post-Soviet Russia dating back to the Yeltsin
presidency]{.underline}.

DW Benn, writing about [the **misunderstanding** of Russia in the
West]{.underline}, notes the presence of these ideas in the centuries
old words of Lord Palmerston himself, who once described a Russian
colleague as "'civil and courteous' but with 'all the cunning of a
half-educated savage.'"16 According to Benn, a special disdain for the
Russian people permeates the discourse about Russia, and is easily
hidden in the above criticisms about contemporary Russian politics and
foreign policy.17 George Kennan once famously wrote that the political
personality of the Soviet Union was one that could not tolerate rivals,
and was too "insensitive," "fierce" and "jealous" to share power. The
Soviets were absorbed with securing absolute power consistent with an
ideology that instructs them to believe that the outside world is
hostile and must be resisted.18 One does not have to look very hard to
find these same sentiments about contemporary Russian leaders.

Andrei [Tsygankov accurately identifies]{.underline} anti-Russianism, or
[**[Russophobia]{.mark}**, in American decision making]{.underline},
defined as "a fear of Russia's political system on the grounds that it
is incompatible with the interests and values of the West in general and
the United States in particular. [This fear finds expression [in]{.mark}
various forms of [criticism]{.mark} of Russia [that are **unbalanced**
and **distorted**]{.mark}. [**No matter** which]{.mark} independent
[actions Moscow may pursue, they are]{.mark} sure to be perceived... as
reflecting Russia's [expansionist]{.mark} interests]{.underline}, not as
a legitimate pursuit of national interests." 19 Russophobia transcends
ideological and partisan lines, as both neo-conservative and liberal
minded groups demonize Russia in fairly equal measure. These attitudes
are more than simply a cultural animosity toward Russians; rather, they
reflect "a very real fear of Russia's political influence" that finds
expression in a distorted critique of Russia and its politics.20 [This
[animosity results in a]{.mark} **persistent [need to contain]{.mark}**
Russia's influence, [even in]{.mark} times of relative [peace]{.mark}
and cooperation between the two nations]{.underline}. This is [evidenced
by the impulse to expand NATO]{.underline} just a few short years after
the end of the Cold War and before the reversal of early expectations
for Russia's democratic consolidation. This will be discussed later in
the paper.

For Tsygankov, [Russia is viewed as an expansionist state]{.underline}
that refuses to abide by "acceptable rules of international behavior,"
owing either to its political culture or its questionable leadership;
either way, it must be "contained or fundamentally transformed."21
[Russophobia is [informed by a **misinterpretation** of]{.mark} Russia's
[history]{.mark}, one [in which Russia has been **forced to respond**
to]{.mark} the actions of [the West,]{.mark} **rather than** represent
some sort of **ingrained** need to conquer and dominate]{.underline}.22
Russia is viewed as an autocratic empire that perpetually oppresses
nationalities, denies its citizens basic rights, "concentrates economic
and military resources in the hands of the state," and doggedly pursues
its inherent and illegitimate expansionist national interests.23 This
last point bears re-stating: Russia is not accorded the courtesy of
being seen to possess legitimate national interests, owing to the above
assumptions about its nature and motivations. Tsygankov notes that,
"[even during the 1990s, when Russia looked]{.underline} more [like a
failing state]{.underline} than one capable of projecting power, some
members of [the American political class were worried about
the]{.underline} future [revival of]{.underline} the Eurasian giant as
[a **revisionist** power]{.underline}."24 He attributes the rampant
triumphalism in the US at the end of the Cold War to this fear of
Russia, noting it reached its zenith in the mid-1990s.25 In fact, it was
actually the Clinton administration that "entrenched the rhetoric of
victorious thinking by drawing the analogy between Russia and the defeat
of Germany and Japan in World War II."26 This triumphalism implied
something inherently superior, and therefore inferior, about the US and
Russia, respectively.

Tsygankov is quick to label American Russophobia as a political
phenomenon rather than a cultural phenomenon, leaving open the
possibility for its willful reversal.27 While it may be the case that
Russophobia's presence in American foreign policy making may not be a
fait accompli, [its presence in the American discourse may reflect more
of a cultural presence of anti-Russianism that is
**self-reinforcing**]{.underline}. In fact, Tsygankov himself notes that
public opinion followed elite opinion and policy,28 which testifies to
its presence in the popular discourse. Tsygankov claims that [the
infusion of Russophobia into elite and popular attitudes about Russia is
the result of a willful construction of an **[anti-Russian
lobby]{.mark}** in order to [advance a particular]{.mark} foreign policy
[agenda]{.mark}]{.underline}. "The Lobby," is [a **deliberate cabal of
anti-Russian military hawks**, or those who presume American
geopolitical hegemony can best be achieved by the military defeat of
Russia]{.underline}, as well as those who assertively presume the
hegemony of so-called liberal values of democracy, rule of law and human
rights.29 This Lobby allegedly dates back to the early 20th Century, its
views solidified by the Cold War, to which members of Congress and
policy makers in the White House have been sympathetic.30 While
Tsygankov acknowledges that some of the Lobby's success could be
attributed to the absence of a pro-Russia lobby in the US,31 his
attention is trained on the Lobby's political goal of fostering
anti-Russian sentiment in the West in support of a "global power
struggle" against a potential "resurgent" Russia, [rife
with]{.underline} what Zbigniew Brzezinski once labeled **["neo-colonial
thinkers."]{.underline}**32

Tsygankov seeks to explain [the construction and persistence of an
anti-Russian lobby]{.underline} that [is purposefully **distorting**
Russia's role in the world]{.underline}, its history and its interests
to advance an anti-Russia agenda; however, this is not the precise case
made herein. Tsygankov's premise is not fundamentally rejected here, but
it is not fully embraced either. There does seem to be a culture of
anti-Russianism present in Washington that has influenced foreign policy
elites, but it may not necessarily be the result of an intentional drive
to keep Russia down. What this paper shares with Tsygankov is the
conviction that Russophobia exists, has a significant influence on
American foreign policy concerning Russia, and therefore must be better
identified and understood. The goal here is not to reveal malevolence
toward Russia, but rather to name this Russophobia, discuss its genesis,
and connect it with foreign policy outcomes in the hope of illuminating
what remains a significant impediment to a more constructive Russia-US
relationship.

In his writing on Russophobia, Anatol Lieven suggests that
[anti-Russianism is [derived]{.mark} in part [from the **myth of
America's**]{.mark} **own [exceptionalism]{.mark}**. This mythology sees
the US standing taller than other nations, able to make objective
observations about other states' motives, and thereby construct
appropriate policy in response]{.underline}. Lieven warns of the dangers
of [such assumptions]{.underline}, because they [render US policy makers
"**incapable of understanding** the opposition of other nations" to its
own policies]{.underline}.33 Lieven takes on NATO expansion directly,
noting that, among the many reasons Russia opposes it, is the US'
failure to appreciate what it means for Russia. US policy makers have
been genuinely puzzled by Russia's failure to perceive its enlargement
as benign, which is due in part to the American rhetoric that exists
alongside the policy decision itself. [It is not only the physical
expansion of NATO that is **problematic**, but the corresponding failure
to bother understanding Russia's interests.]{.underline} This
unwillingness to understand Russia, combined with the embrace of
longstanding and outworn stereotypes about Russia, assumptions about the
pattern of history in Russia, as well [as [a **Cold War
"hangover"**]{.mark}]{.underline} of sorts, [which cannot shake the
image of **Russia-as-threat**,]{.underline} all [contribute to
define]{.underline} Russophobia and [the discourse within which American
foreign policy is made]{.underline}.

Lieven speculates that the intellectual basis for this Russophobia may
stem from 19th Century British propaganda regarding Russian expansionism
and its inherent wickedness. Lieven notes that this demonization of
other peoples, sometimes taking on a racist tone, has long been present
within Western, and American, foreign policy making.34 Moreover, there
is a tendency to assume that what was once assumed about a nation and
its peoples shall forever be true about them, even in the absence of
supporting evidence. This sort of historical determinism denies a
nuanced appreciation for cultural evolution and very much denies the
potential for American leaders to view post-Soviet Russia's
disappointing struggles with democracy for what they are. Instead, they
have been viewed against the backdrop of Russia's Tsarist and Communist
experiences and are therefore "wicked."35 This is evidenced by Henry
Kissinger's 2000 remark that Russian imperialism has continued for
centuries, characterized by subjugation of its neighbours and "overawing
those not under its direct control" and in Zbigniew Brzezinski's
assigning of blame for Stalinist-era policies to present day Russians.36
[For Lieven, to view past conduct as less a product of history and more
a product of culture or "national DNA" of sorts, [comes **perilously
close to racism**]{.mark}. There is a certain **essentialism** in the
American discourse on Russia that equates these acts with
"Russianness."]{.underline} Perhaps, as Tsygankov suggests,
[[**demonizing** Russia]{.mark} continued to [help **justify US
strategy**]{.mark} toward the USSR in the Cold War.]{.underline} For
Lieven, [[this **legitimized**]{.mark} **the [military
buildup]{.mark}**, the **containment**, the worldview and actions that
stemmed from the need to balance Soviet power]{.underline}.37 Yet, as
Lieven importantly notes, even those who demonize Russia for its past
seem to have little problem embracing Communist China,38 so perhaps it
is not communism in Russia's past the Western leaders fear, but rather
something cultural, something innately "Russian."

Lieven concurs about [the self-reinforcing nature of Russophobia, noting
the US' **"need for enemies"**]{.underline}39 [as an instrumental
component of its **own narrative of exceptionalism**]{.underline}.
Perhaps [**[the result of viewing Russia as the enemy]{.mark}** for so
long **[is]{.mark}** the reason **[it has become
one]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Russophobia has enabled the judging of
Russia "by utterly different standards than those applied to other
countries."40 Tsygankov and Lieven are correct to suggest a linkage
between Russophobia and America's own mythologies about its place in the
world. America's destiny is to be a cultural hegemon atop the global
hierarchy of nations. [The perception of [American superiority]{.mark}
seems to **[require an "other"]{.mark}** to assume a position of
inferiority]{.underline}. Russia has long represented a new cultural
frontier and a divergent history, one that was assumed to be far less
"exceptional" than the American experience. [Challenges to the
presumption of American hegemony have often been met with not simply
disagreement, but a **de-legitimizing** of the very existence of the
'other.']{.underline} Russia is not immune from ideas of exceptionalism
and the two nations have perpetuated a soft rivalry that possesses
"nationalist phobias"41 that can be mutually reinforcing.

Gertan Dijkink acknowledges that this "gross distinction between East
and West as opposite cultures" is part of the US discourse on Russia.42
For Dijkink, this does not have to be addressed directly, or be part of
a public discussion, because [it has become
**"naturalized,"**]{.underline} or considered to be common sense. He
notes that experience and [discourse create an **imaginative geography**
of the outside world, which contributes to the **construction** of
visions of the world]{.underline}."43 Dijkink notes that, after all,
["American foreign policy aims to perpetuate, serve and affirm the
American way of life,"]{.underline}44 [thus helping to explain why
Russia's alternative to "the American way," presents a
challenge]{.underline}. Georg [Lofflman confirms the impact of mythology
on discourse and the **influence** on foreign policy
outcomes]{.underline}.45 [**[Myths shape identity]{.mark}**, become
themselves part of identity, [and **influence
action**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is reasonable to suggest that
[American exceptionalism influences Russophobia]{.underline}. If the US
is unique, its values superior, and therefore its preeminence in the
international system assumed, and if Russia fundamentally challenges
these values -- America's very identity -- in some way, then fear of
what Russia represents may be a consequence. Putin himself famously
warned Americans in 2013 of the dangers of seeing themselves as
exceptional.46

Richard Sakwa notes the difficult time US leaders have had accepting
Russia as an equal.47 Russia did not see itself as a defeated power
after the Cold War and conducted itself as such, a view in opposition to
the prevailing Washington narrative. Sakwa notes that Russia as a
democratic state was no less revisionist than Russia as a communist
state and that this was threatening to the existing world order that
presumed the hegemony of western liberal ideas.48 [Even though Russian
foreign policy was **actually fairly unthreatening**, and could even be
characterized as **collaborative** for many years, it was not
universally viewed this way because of the geopolitical threat it was
perceived to represent]{.underline}.49 Sakwa also claims that some of
the anti-Russianism has a strong basis in history, as Russia has never
really [been]{.underline} considered to be a part of Europe. Its very
presence has motivated European integration; post WWII European identity
was constructed on the basis of Russian exclusion, a reality that was
confirmed by decades of the Cold War. That the fear of Russia and the
exclusionary attitude toward Russia persist, driven largely by the
United States and the derivative suspicion of Russia from the Cold War
period, is problematic but not surprising.50

Russophobia in Western discourse has been written about, by Russians
themselves - poets and writers - for nearly two centuries.51 Some have
suggested that Russian fears of American Russophobia fuel a siege
mentality present within Moscow since the end of the Cold War.
Russophobia has had an impact; it has influenced the manner in which
Russia approaches its own relations with the West. Valentina Feklyunina
confirms that [the assumption of American [Russophobia]{.mark} by
Russians themselves has **shaped Russia's self
perception**]{.underline}, and more importantly it has shaped Russia's
expectations for how foreign nations will engage with them.52 [Russian
leaders anticipate anti-Russianism in their dealings with the West,
which **shapes and [perpetuate]{.mark} an ["us vs. them"
discourse]{.mark}** among Russian decision makers that may be
[reinforcing the narrative of fear]{.mark} in Washington]{.underline}.

Russophobia ought not be confused with criticism of Russia. Heikki
Luostarinen cautions that Finland, for example, no longer exhibits
Russophobia, but that it remains free to offer social and political
criticism.53 Russophobia is more than a disagreement or even competing
values; in fact, during the Cold War, Russophobia took on what
Luostarinen identifies as racist tones reflected in movies about the
evils of the Soviet empire.54 The USSR was often cast not simply as the
enemy, but as an evil villain, which justified its complete evisceration
and for which no action taken toward this goal could be considered
illegitimate. This demonization of the enemy may have parallels with the
post 9/11 discourse about terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda and the
Islamic State (IS). During the Cold War, hostilities with the Soviet
Union gave way to "fear, moral disgust and ignorance," which were
coupled with a lack of knowledge about the Soviet Union. Luostarinen
explains that [this **enemy imaging**]{.underline} involves the belief,
by a cultural or political group and even a nation state itself, that
one's very security and fundamental values are purposefully and
meaningfully threatened by the other.55 This enemy [becomes essential to
**identity construction** and may even serve some **collective
psychological need** to perceive a threat for which a **harsh response**
is justified]{.underline}. Externalizing a common threat can be
essential to legitimizing a collective identity and historical
experience.56 [This **"us vs. them" narrative** can feed a **powerful
[nationalism]{.mark}**, which can provide a context for behaviors that
might otherwise be difficult to legitimize.]{.underline} This enemy
construction can become ingrained as mythology among members of a
society. The "enemy image may strengthen integration within a given
group and moderate internal conflicts; [it may help to **bring the rank
and file behind the group leaders**; it may be used [**(scapegoat)** to
**explain**]{.mark} **any [injustices]{.mark}** within the
group]{.underline}."57 Luostarinen is careful to note that the
construction of an enemy image does not mean that the so-called enemy
itself is not guilty of actions that contribute to its demonization. The
construction of an enemy image of Russia stems largely from the very
real fact that, for centuries, Russia has stood for much of what Western
values opposed: "autocracy, national repression, and conservatism" and
later "radicalism and social revolution."58 Fear of Russian aggression
has been in place since the 16th Century, blossoming alongside the
growth of Russian power.59 But [this **[fear]{.mark}** was [coupled with
the **racist view** of Russians as]{.mark} an [inferior]{.mark},
inherently violent race that could not be trusted, thereby necessitating
the conclusion that peaceful coexistence could not be countenanced;
mistrust of the Russian leadership [transformed into]{.mark} a
**[cultural loathing]{.mark}** of Russians themselves]{.underline}.60
John Gleason describes as deep seated fear or dislike of Russia, which
is the result of misunderstanding of Russian history and culture, rooted
in "competitive imperial ambitions."61 Gleason notes that it may be a
natural inclination to fear that which we know the least,62 which could
help to explain the presence of Russophobia in earlier periods when
connection with cultures across the globe was a rare occurrence. It does
far less to explain the persistence of Russophobia in a time in which,
notwithstanding the warnings of Samuel Huntington and others for whom
cultural difference is a basis for conflict,63 contemporary access to a
diversity of cultures can prompt cultural awareness, acceptance, and
even fusion. This does not appear to be the case with American views of
Russia, which remain imbued with an air of repugnance in which even
minor differences take on elevated significance.

This lingering hostility toward Russia -- [Russophobia - has fostered an
environment in which **cooperation is difficult** and missed
opportunities abound. [As a consequence]{.mark} of the perpetual
misinterpretation of Russia, US [leaders **miss**]{.mark} **key
[opportunities]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} finding [compatibility]{.mark}
with Russia, particularly in key matters of security such as fighting
terrorism, dealing with weapons proliferation, illegal drugs, energy
security and working together to address instability in strategic and
volatile regions]{.underline}64 [[and informs]{.mark} the pursuit of a
foreign [policy]{.mark} agenda [that **needlessly antagonizes**]{.mark}
Russia [in]{.mark} an already uncertain international system. Moreover,
the **[expansion of NATO]{.mark}** eastward is evidence for some that
the US continues to fight the Cold War and has perpetuated in response
an extant anti-Americanism in Russia that will continue to make it
difficult for the US to pursue its interests]{.underline}.

#### The fact that they can't really explain why Russia invaded is [our argument]{.underline}. Simple statements like "history and culture prove" are [racist Orientalist tropes]{.underline} which belie a broader investigation into Russian foreign policy. That means they make Russian invasions [likely]{.underline} and [worse]{.underline}, but the alt [solves]{.underline} them.

Western orientalism and russia Russia's invasion of Georgia, annexation
of Crimea and willingness to support Assad in Syria, challenged Western
presuppositions of the post-Cold War era. [The revival of tension
between NATO]{.underline} powers [and Russia has]{.underline} also
[ended]{.underline} the [post-Cold War optimism]{.underline} that Russia
would Westernize and become a Western style liberal democracy. The
following, aims to provide a critical examination of the discourse
surrounding tensions with Russia. [As [Western analysts]{.mark} have
rushed [to explain Russia's belligerence, there is a frequent **recourse
to simplistic cultural explanations**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In looking
to Russia's foreign policy actions since the Georgian war of 2008,
"[many]{.underline} Western observers," have [[concluded,
"**Russia**]{.mark} and the Russians **[defy
logic]{.mark}**."]{.underline} 52 [The **[failure to]{.mark} adequately
[engage with Russian politics]{.mark}** [and **develop a deeper
understanding of Russian foreign policy**]{.mark} reflects a **long
trend of Western discourse to see Russia as defined by its geography and
culture.**]{.underline} It is the legacy of a Soviet and Tsarist past
which is used to understand Russia's actions today.53 Thomas Graham even
argued that Europe has a "Russia problem" stretching back 200 years
based on a cultural "values gap." 54 Graham further argued that
contemporary tensions could essentially be traced to the Tsarist
policies of the post-Napoleonic era. Explanations of Russian foreign
policy have often relied on a primordialist perspective to explain
Russia's actions. That only by looking long back into Russia's history
and national identity can we understand Russia's contemporary foreign
policy. To explain Russia's actions in the international sphere, Western
observes look to Russia's long history and expansive geography;55 but
this primordial explanation is used in a deterministic manner. [[Because
of Russia's history and geography **it is accused of**
]{.mark}**following a [recurring]{.mark} "pattern" of [conflict]{.mark}
with the West**]{.underline}.56 [Historical and geopolitical
explanations are not orientalist by themselves, it is [the tendency to
**reduce these explanations to a deterministic
approach**]{.mark}]{.underline} which **[[is
orientalist]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[West]{.mark}ern foreign policy
then becomes [portrayed as rational]{.mark}]{.underline}, responding to
incentives, [while [Russia]{.mark} is portrayed [as]{.mark} being guided
by some [historic]{.mark} impulse [or]{.mark} flaw in its
[culture]{.mark}]{.underline}. The fighting in Ukraine and the
annexation of Crimea has been interpreted as a "frontal challenge to the
post-Cold War European regional order." 57 Russia's actions created
surprise and shock for analysts and policy makers alike, but there have
been few serious investigations into Russia's strategic decisions.
Instead, [Western public discourse has followed an **orientalist trend**
in **blaming an irrational leadership and its Eastern
culture**.]{.underline} The use of force by Russia is also seen as
uniquely linked to Putin's leadership. The Ukraine and Georgia crisis is
blamed on Putin's "unique response" 58 and Putin's "choice." 59 [[There
seems **little attempt to explore**]{.mark} either **[the workings
o]{.mark}f the [Russian leadership or]{.mark}** to **[consider]{.mark}**
in more detail **[why Russia chose to intervene]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Instead, [[there is a tendency to **embrace simplistic arguments**
blaming Putin's]{.mark} "unconstrained, [erratic
adventurism."]{.mark}]{.underline} 60 [Western analysts argue Putin's
"surprise policy decisions," and his "rashness," "have astounded even
expert analysis."]{.underline} 61 What is significant about the attempts
to blame solely Putin is that he is seen as uniquely responsible.
[[Putin]{.mark} as the **sole figure** involved is then [portrayed as an
"ideologue]{.mark}"]{.underline} 62 and as a "gambler." 63 His actions
are not seen as the rational choice of a leader responding to a
realpolitik environment. However, counter arguments have been made which
show Russia's hybrid war in Ukraine was not an irrational opportunistic
gamble, but an attempt to coerce Kiev into negotiations.64 But while
such alternative explanations have been discussed in academic
publications they have not been widely covered within the Western media.
The Ukraine crisis has, however, been widely covered in the media for
its use of hybrid warfare. The surprise and confusion these events
created within Western political commentary was intertwined with an
orientalist perspective that sought to highlight Russia's cultural
differences to the West. Hybrid warfare has been described as a conflict
between "East and West." 65 What is significant in this portrayal is
that [[Russia's hybrid warfare]{.mark} is]{.underline} then [**viewed in
omnipotent terms** which **[exaggerates]{.mark}** Russia's power and
ability]{.underline}.66 Western observers have long demonized Eastern
tactics in war as irrational, deceptive and underhanded.67 In describing
Russia's actions, Western analysts repeat this formula by accusing
Russia of using "shadowy tactics" 68 of being "sneaky" 69 and using
tactics based on "deceit." 70 Hybrid warfare is further interpreted with
reference to the Ancient Chinese strategist Sun Tzu.71 The reputation of
Sun Tzu as an Eastern general willing to use deception and secrecy to
win battles is then compared to Russia's own use of asymmetric
warfare.72 But crucially, this historical analogy devolves further into
an orientalist perspective when Russia is accused of being, not just a
"sneaky" Easterner, but by not playing by "the rules." 73 Russia's use
of asymmetric warfare is not interpreted as a rational response to
material or strategic constraints, but is blamed for being deceptive.
The significance of these critiques is that Russia is accused of not
acting in a manner acceptable to the West. Russia's hybrid war is
understood as breaking the rules and as Martin Zapfe argues, Russia
"seems to have rejected the established Western playbook." 74 It is the
"strategic culture" of Russia which is seen to be at fault in rejecting
Western ways of war.75 [These portrayals of a Russian East as enigmatic
and dangerous, diverging from Western norms **shows an orientalist
perspective**]{.underline}.76 Looking to Sun Tzu in order to understand
contemporary military strategy can be illuminating. But what makes these
perspectives problematic is the way Russia is viewed as acting in a way
that the West would never contemplate. For example, Russia is accused of
being uniquely better suited to hybrid warfare because of Putin's
"central guiding authority." 77 [This ignores that the concept of hybrid
warfare **originated with the US**]{.underline}78 [and **Western uses of
deception**, **covert tactics** or **proxy fighters becomes essentially
ignored**]{.underline}. Rod Thornton argues further that, "the basic
problem across the board is that liberal democracies have an inherent
distaste for producing anything at the strategic level that resembles
propaganda or could be classed as psychological warfare." 79 [The long
US history of propaganda and covert war in both the Cold War and the War
on Terror is therefore negated and exempt from
consideration.]{.underline} As Rory Cormac and Richard Aldrich have
argued, much of IR, "offers a simplistic view of secrecy" and Western
covert action by taking "plausible deniability at face value." 80
Attempts to critically analyze Russia's use of asymmetric warfare have
therefore failed to fully engage with the West's own use of covert
warfare. [[Russia's actions are]{.mark} **no doubt
[threatening]{.mark}** to the West **and** are **problematic in raising
tensions**]{.underline}. [[But in adapting an orientalist perspective,
**Western discourse surrounding Russia** ]{.mark}has **[limited our
understandings of]{.mark}** these **[conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
The US and its allies routinely use covert action as part of the War on
Terror but Western war is still seen as fundamentally different to
Russia's Eastern way of warfare. As Jonathan Caverley argues, Russia has
4,000 troops involved in the Syrian "war," while the US has had 10,000
personnel involved in Afghanistan 19 years after the invasion and yet,
this is not considered as a "war." 81 It is described as a NATO support
mission. Debates over the nuance of these definitions are not meant to
confuse our understandings of war, but can help to illustrate our
presuppositions. As this section has shown, Russia's actions in Ukraine,
Syria and Georgia have often been understood through cultural
explanations. There is a risk, however, of such cultural explanations
slipping into an essentialist and "ahistorical myth." 82 Conflicts are
not just about physical security, but raise existential questions in
relation to the self and the other. Narratives of conflict can also lead
to the reproduction of conflict as ontological security for one group
can lead to insecurity for another.83 The following section will
therefore examine how cultural explanations have led to an othering of
Russia as separate and distinct from an American led Western liberal
order.

[[Feminism **provides an alt**]{.mark}**ernate [world-view]{.mark}**
[where the]{.mark} life sustaining [activities women are
assigned]{.mark} the position of [prominence]{.mark} they
deserve]{.underline}. Critical analysis of the current state of affairs
by feminists [has led to envisioning a better future.]{.underline} Many
feminists have articulated these visions. There is a remarkable
convergence of broad principles underling these visions. [[They
**include a way of life**]{.mark} [where]{.mark} there is
[harmony]{.mark} with nature, [cooperation and]{.mark} mutual
[respect]{.mark} among people and a pervasive concern for justice and
care for all people.]{.underline} Such [**[visions promote a holistic,
interdependent world-view]{.mark}** and social relations]{.underline}
that emphasize cooperation (Mies and Shiva 1993; Gross 1996; Cooey 1991;
Goldenberg 1990). A holistic approach to life includes several
interrelated, interconnected and irreducible goals. Within this
perspective, [[reproduction of life and the maintenance of]{.mark}
health and [well-being]{.mark} of all people **[are placed at the
front]{.mark}** and center of societal and individual
objectives.]{.underline} This means that success in life is not measured
by the amount of money one has or the number of goods collected, nor by
the degree of control held over other lives[. It means that we become
conscious of the impact of our own lifestyles]{.underline} on others,
and learn to live our lives so as to promote, not only our own health
and well-being, but everyone else's. [[We learn to resolve conflicts
through **peaceful means**]{.mark} resisting the waste of resources for
military build-up and armed conflict.]{.underline} The consequence is
that [resources can be spent on the reproduction of life and peaceful
coexistence.]{.underline} We learn to think that difference does not
mean inequality and that one style of life is not necessarily better, as
long as it is lived in a nonexploitative manner[. [A holistic
approach]{.underline}]{.mark} [also [means]{.mark} that [we]{.mark} do
not [consider nature]{.mark}/environment [as something]{.mark} that is
'out there\', but consider it to be [intimately connected to our
lives]{.mark}]{.underline}. If we ruin the environment, we ruin our own
health and well-being. [The tendency to think in dualistic terms is
avoided.]{.underline} This is important because one of the problems with
the current life style is compartmentalization of activities in life.
[As producers/paid workers we do not care whether a given product has
use value and whether it promotes human welfare. The only concern is
whether it can sell and make maximum profit.]{.underline} Therefore
slick advertising and sophisticated public relations strategies are
adopted to sell the products. The products can be toxic chemicals,
biological weapons of human destruction, or genetically modified food,
the impact of which is not yet established. In addition, no attention is
paid to environmental depletion, degradation or pollution. [[We]{.mark},
as consumers, must [demand clean air]{.mark} and [water]{.mark}, a safe
environment [and]{.mark} healthy [food]{.mark}. As investors and
shareholders of various financial institutions, the overwhelming concern
is the return on our investment. Often **[no attention is paid
as]{.mark} [to how]{.mark} these [returns are
obtained]{.mark}**.]{.underline} They may easily have been obtained by
depriving people of their livelihood. We demand lower price on quality
products but do not generally stop to think how it is obtained. [As
citizens [we show concern]{.mark} about child labour in developing
countries [and make]{.mark} [pronouncements of condemnation]{.mark}
without stopping to think that, in most cases, child labour is required
to make ends meet as the people are exploited by capitalistic
greed.]{.underline} Relational analysis is required to shed light on
these inconsistencies. Such practices are in vogue not only because
pursuit of self-interest is [promoted, [but]{.mark} also because
[we]{.mark} are given to [believe that **some people are more**]{.mark}
**[deserving]{.mark}** than others. [This is]{.mark} particularly
[evident]{.mark} in contexts [where people are different on the basis
of]{.mark} [gender]{.mark}, [race]{.mark}/ethnicity, [class or sexual
orientation]{.mark} to name a few indices of social status.]{.underline}
Difference often means hierarchy. PhilomenaEssed(1991), for example, has
argued that EuroAmericans believe in racial and ethnic hierarchy because
the belief systems made popular during colonialism and imperialism have
become part of common sense knowledge[. In general people do not see any
inconsistency between believing in democracy and individual rights and
considering non-white people as inferior.]{.underline} Such a belief in
the coexistence of democracy and racism is labeled as democratic racism
by Francis Henry (1995[). Audre Lorde argues that [much of western
history]{.mark} has [conditioned people to see]{.mark} [themselves "**in
simplistic opposition to each other**]{.mark} dominant/ subordinate,
good/bad, superior/inferior"]{.underline} (1984:114). Such a belief
system, she argues, is functional because, in a society, where good is
defined in terms of profit rather than in terms of human need, there
must always be some group of people who, through systematized
oppression, can be made to feel surplus to occupy the place of the
dehumanized inferior. (1984:114) [She continues, somewhere, on the edge
of consciousness[, there is \... a mythical norm]{.mark}. In North
America **[it is usually]{.mark} defined as [white]{.mark},
[thin]{.mark}, [male,]{.mark} [young]{.mark}, [heterosexual,]{.mark}**
Christian, and financially secure]{.underline}. {116) Under these
circumstances acknowledging and respecting differences is threatening.
[Vandana Shiva (1994), arguing in a similar vein, writes that [there is
a link between the West's]{.mark} long thought-[war against]{.mark}
cultural [diversity and its]{.mark} legal and economic [war against
biodiversity,]{.mark}]{.underline} which currently threatens the global
environment. She shows how knowledge monopolies work by enclosing,
controlling and privatizing both biodiversity (diverse species) and
cultural diversity (marginalized and third world knowledges). Her
account of the links between western knowledge systems and the
world-wide environmental crisis illustrates that neoimperialism is a
world-system that privileges western countries and transnational
corporations and those institutions they control, such as the World bank
and the IMF. [**[Coalition building]{.mark}** is a difficult task under
these circumstances. It requires patience and perseverance.
[Difficulties are]{.mark} mainly [due to]{.mark} [differences in power
among groups **due to**]{.mark} **the [historical]{.mark} legacy of
[exploitation and domination]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} Patricia
Collins (1986) proposes a model which she labels 'matrix of differences'
to make a relational analysis among groups and individuals. She argues
that [various dimensions of social status such as gender, race,
ethnicity and class are all simultaneous systems of action and meaning
that intersect with one another and are interlocked to produce
particular types of experiences for all people.]{.underline} These
experiences become crystallized in institutional structures. Unequal
relationships among people are routinely reproduced. To build coalitions
across such differences, Kate Young (1988) argues that [everyone, those
who are in positions of domination and those who are in positions of
subordination, must agree that [it **is in everyone's**]{.mark}
**strategic [interest]{.mark}** [to stem]{.mark} the tide of
[enviro]{.mark}nmental [destruction]{.mark}, global [poverty]{.mark},
[consumerism and **deterioration of**]{.mark} **quality of
[life]{.mark}.** (7-9)]{.underline}

In New Atlantis (1624), Bacon describes the scientists of Solomon's
House practicing both observation and manipulation of the weather: "We
have high towers . . . for the view of divers meteors---as winds, rain,
snow, hail, and some of the fiery meteors also. And upon them in some
places are dwellings of hermits, whom we visit sometimes and instruct
what to observe . . . and engines for multiplying and enforcing of winds
to set also on divers motions" (399[). In great experimental spaces,
[researchers imitate and]{.mark} [demonstrate]{.mark} natural [meteors
such as snow, hail, rain, thunder, lightning, and]{.mark} "some
artificial rains of bodies and not of water]{.underline}" (400). Three
so-called mystery [men]{.underline} are in charge of expanding the
repertoire of practices not yet brought into the arts, and three
pioneers or miners try new experiments "such as themselves think good"
(410); that is, they [[manipulate nature without further review or
oversight,]{.mark} a task requiring perfect virtue and vision in the
experimentalist.]{.underline} Bacon was conversant with a venerable
humanistic tradition that divided history into three parts---ancient,
medieval, and modern---but his valuation of the three eras was
asymmetric. He granted grudging respect to the ancients, denigrated the
Middle Ages, and elevated modern accomplishments to equal or
soon-to-be-greater status than those of antiquity. For Bacon, the rise
of modern science was due to "the true method of experience . . .
commencing . . . with experience duly ordered and digested, not bungling
or erratic, and from it educing axioms, and from established axioms,
again new experiments" (115). "[New discoveries," [Bacon]{.mark} argued,
"must be sought from the light of nature, not fetched back out of the
darkness of antiquity" (154). He [elaborated at length,]{.mark} of
course, on [his new method]{.mark}, the important point being that, in
his view, [the sciences were]{.mark} about [to enter]{.mark} [a period
of great fertility]{.mark} because of his new metho]{.underline}d.
Bacon's communitarian campaign was taken over by innumerable
practitioners in the seventeenth century. His greatest legacy, without
doubt, was institutional, in that his outlook was absorbed by the Royal
Society of London and by many other scientific societies that dominate
the field to this day. Bacon has long been known as both [[the]{.mark}
founder ([father) of the scientific]{.mark} [method]{.mark} and as [a
chauvinist and misogynist who excluded women]{.mark} from the study of
nature]{.underline} (Merchant 1980). [[He employed sexualized language
to describe]{.mark} what a "[new science]{.mark}" should look like. He
claimed that the goddess of wisdom Minerva was born straight from
Jupiter's head, without female conception. For Bacon, [knowledge is
masculine power over nature, and]{.mark} "[science is a chaste]{.mark}
and lawful [marriage]{.mark} between Mind and Nature [that will bind
Nature to man's service and make her his slave]{.mark}." [Nature's
enslaved children]{.mark} [include]{.mark} natural resources---[mineral,
vegetable, animal---and other humans]{.mark}, i.e.,
everything.]{.underline} In his fragmentary essay, "The Masculine Birth
of Time" (1603), Bacon called for a "blessed race of Hermes and
Supermen" who could "hound," "conquer and subdue Nature," "shake her to
her foundations," and "storm and occupy her castles and strongholds"
(Fox-Keller 1985, 48--54). [[Today's]{.mark} Baconian ["Supermen" are

**Science seeks to mansplain objective truths, thwarting communicative
collaboration**

**[[Scientific standpointlessness]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, [[is
no longer the exclusive province of recognized
scientists]{.underline}]{.mark} and academics. [[So-called
\'scientificness\', a standpoint from \`above and beyond\',
is]{.underline}]{.mark} establishing itself
[[increasingly]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[in everyday
language]{.underline}]{.mark} and thought. As the scientific subject
speaks from nowhere, making [[an \`objective\' representation of reality
from a standpoint above and beyond that reality]{.underline}]{.mark}, so
the speaking subject increasingly **[[does not speak from a position
within a speech situation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as a person in
communication with another person: **[[the subject speaks from the
position of \`truth\', the \`objective\' view of reality, the
objectification of reality]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As a speaking subject
it refers not to the other\'s speech, but to [the alleged content of
that speech, of which it now makes its own representation]{.underline}.
The structure of [the interaction is not a process of establishing
mutual understanding, of searching for common points of
understanding]{.underline} between two communicants: **[[it is a
competition between representations of the \`state of
affairs\']{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[The emphasis is on the \`content\'
of discussion, at the expense of the process of
communication]{.underline}]{.mark}, the professed aim to understand the
\`matter\' under discussion rather than one\'s interlocutor. [The
communicative situation is seen no longer as the coming together of
people wishing to understand each other]{.underline}, nor is the process
of communication seen as another \`matter\' to be understood:
communication is seen as an encounter, an arena for a competition
between opinions and a struggle between rivalling representations - the
stage for a battle between speaking subjects. A semblance of critical
discussion is maintained in that some points of the critique, having
indeed been heard, turn up reworked in the subject\'s own discourse.
**[[The necessity for dialogue has thus been evaded and the subject
stays in control of the discourse.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Thus it became
common place to re-render Black women\'s critique by reformulations such
as that \`[Black women have been excluded]{.underline} from the women\'s
movement and from feminist discourse\', that they have been
\`invisible\' [and have been unable to contribute to
feminism]{.underline}, or that they are \`criticizing feminism\'. As
Black feminists have pointed out again and again, this renders the
women\'s movement identical with white women, feminism identical with
the feminism of white women, reproducing the very
white-women-centredness, the arrogant perspective of white women who
consider themselves to be \`the movement\' and declaring it to be
reality. It gathers \`us\' together as the movement and \`them\' as
those outside criticizing \`it\'. Hence the issue no longer is white
women\'s oppressive behaviour, but Black women\'s absence from the
movement - to which the quick response has been to issue an invitation
addressed to Black women to \'join\' the movement (ours), to participate
in our conferences and to fill the ranks of our rallies so that these
will no longer suffer from the stigma of exclusive whiteness. The
enterprise remains in the interest of the entrepreneurs, but Black women
are now in demand and needed to stave off any future critique that white
women are excluding Black women.

#### Science thwarts movement through objectification of women, defining reality, preventing the subjecthood of women or social movements

The refusal of large sections of the women\'s liberation movement to
designate leaders, directors and presidents has precisely been one of
its most characteristic features - and one of its most effective forms
of resisting the existing power relations and hierarchies of society. If
at the alleged \`centre\' self-styled leaders have none the less
emerged, this is a problem of the practice and understanding of these
particular women, as well as of those who have helped to \`elect\' them.
It does not mean a leadership, however, which has been recognized or
accepted in the women\'s movement at large, just as the \`centre\' is
not generally deemed to be the centre except by those who consider
themselves in it. What has been recognized, however, is that this
constitutes an attempt to take power and control the movement. Rather,
[[it is a problem of a feminist social science if it scientifically
declares as centre what deems itself to be the
centre]{.underline}]{.mark} - if, in other words, **[[it assumes the
dominant white point of view]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[The sociological
method constructs its object of study, the \`movement\', as if it were
an object and not a historical]{.mark}]{.underline} (even if
collective[[) subject. As object it becomes a thing, which the subject
may view from all sides and apparently is in a position to encompass as
a whole. The scientific subject describes and measures its object
according to standards and criteria which are not defined by the
movement itself, but which are imposed on it from
outside.]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[This]{.underline}]{.mark}** is a
**[[process of objectification]{.underline}]{.mark}** and hence an
exercise of power which is [**[identical to that which constitutes
scientific discourse as a whole, and which does not either differ from
the androcentric construction of women as
objects]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

### 2NC\-\--L\-\--Military 

#### The [military]{.underline} serves as a [patriarchal institution]{.underline}\-\--rejecting [adaptation]{.underline} under the concern of "[operational effectiveness]{.underline}" enforcing the [gender dynamics of war]{.underline}

Deploying Feminism might seem like a deliberately provocative title, but
it draws attention to [the [militarization of global]{.mark}
[norms]{.mark} that were originally [intended to advance gender
equality]{.mark}]{.underline}.5 In the military domain, these norms find
their endorsement in the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda, a
series of UN resolutions that were adopted to account for the gendered
nature of conflict. I argue that, in the process of implementation,
armed forces have interpreted this agenda with a predominant focus on
the gender composition of the armed forces and on the principles that
guide operational performance. Indeed, there are two main mechanisms by
which these norms are militarized when armed forces are tasked with
making their operational plans a reality[. The [first mechanism
employed]{.mark} by military forces consists of [presenting women as
**force**]{.mark} **[multipliers]{.mark}** on the basis of gender
considerations]{.underline}, as per the previous example from
Afghanistan where [women are referred to as a "secret
weapon."]{.underline} [The [second]{.mark} mechanism consists of
[leveraging **gender-based analysis**]{.mark} to improve mission
outcomes, which can be done by men or women]{.underline}. There are
other ways by which WPS principles are affecting military operations,
like placing a greater focus on conflict-related sexual violence or
preventing sexual exploitation and abuse; but they are secondary as
areas of operational focus, especially for NATO. While more and more
military institutions are adopting WPS norms and ostensibly subscribing
to the feminist ideas that propelled the creation of these norms, [the
[process of]{.mark} [translating]{.mark} them [into military]{.mark}
practice [**distorts** their original intent]{.mark}]{.underline}, what
I refer to as norm distortion. I define norm distortion as a mechanism
by which a norm's original meaning is transformed in the process of its
implementation. In practice, then, [the military **[rationale]{.mark}**
and narrative underpinning the WPS agenda are profoundly rooted in a
single, overarching [concern: **operational
effectiveness**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The practices described in this book are consistent with a particular
type of feminism that has flourished in security and defense
institutions; it is a type of feminism that is not anti-military but
instead open to the idea that military institutions can act as agents of
progressive change.6 British academic and feminist activist Cynthia
Cockburn has deplored this shift, commenting on how WPS norms, once
recognized as a global feminist victory, have been diverted:

It was "our" achievement. It was "our" project and "our" success. Yet
the [[more]{.mark} energetically we push for its
[implementation]{.mark}, the [more]{.mark} we see its
**[limitations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Worse, we realize how it can be
used for ends quite contrary to those we intended]{.underline}. In this
respect, NATO is a thought-provoking case. No. . . . more than that,
[it's an enraging example of how good [feminist work]{.mark} can be
[manipulated by a **patriarchal** and **militarist**
institution]{.mark}]{.underline}.7

[While the adoption of Resolution 1325 and the launch of the WPS agenda
were initially seen as [feminist]{.mark} achievements, the
[agenda]{.mark} was subsequently [implemented in ways that fueled
**cynicism**]{.mark}]{.underline}.8 NATO's adoption of the WPS agenda
was not done in consultation with civil society; it was packaged by NATO
for N=\\ATO and tailored to the pursuit of its own goals.9 As Shepherd
has perhaps best put it, feminists criticize the WPS agenda for making
war "safe for women" rather than challenging military entrenchment in
the way the international community approaches conflict resolution.10

[Deploying Feminism, with its oxymoronic undertones, illustrates the
[major shift]{.mark} that has occurred in military
institutions]{.underline}. [Most prevalent [within Western armed
forces]{.mark}, but certainly [visible elsewhere]{.mark}, the
[objections about]{.mark} including [women]{.mark} in the military on
the [basis]{.mark} that it would [**undermine** operational]{.mark}
[effectiveness]{.mark} have been [replaced by]{.mark} the **opposite
argument**: that [women improve operational]{.mark} [effectiveness
because of the **gendered dynamics of war**]{.mark}]{.underline}. If you
have seen the movie Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, you may recall that Tina
Fey's character, a journalist reporting from Afghanistan, gained
valuable information about the destruction of a well after talking to
Afghan women in a village, information that was not accessible to male
soldiers patrolling the area.11 In this instance, although the soldiers
are learning a valuable lesson about their operating environment, the
local women are no better off. Yet, this is an example of [the kind of
**[gender-based epiphany]{.mark}** that is being [embedded into
military]{.mark} training]{.underline}.

When soldiers and officers perpetrate violence against civilians rather
than combatants, state and society may interpret their violent acts as
excessive rather than heroic. Feminist scholars, however, argue that
[[excessive violence perpetrated by soldiers]{.underline}]{.mark} is not
incidental, but [[grows out of]{.mark} the very [processes that]{.mark}
help [construct **militarized masculinity**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Sandra
Whitworth (2004, 99) notes that military [training
["involves]{.underline} ]{.mark}[selecting for and [reinforcing
aggressive behaviour]{.mark}."]{.underline} Furthermore, the
[exaggerated ideals of manhood]{.mark} that are inculcated through
[military training]{.mark} often [[rely on]{.mark} the [devaluation of
(gender]{.mark}ed, [race]{.mark}d, and/or [homosexual)
"**others**."]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Excessive violence vis-à-vis the
"other" is an outcome inherent to the making of
soldiers]{.underline}]{.mark} (Whitworth 2004, Chapters 4 and 6). ["[The
other" is central]{.underline}]{.mark} [not only to the making but also
[to the reproduction of militarized masculinity.]{.mark}]{.underline}
For example, a clear-cut picture of [the "[other"]{.underline}]{.mark}
[in war helps to j[ustify more aggressive behavior]{.mark} toward the
enemy]{.underline}. When soldiers start [[empathi]{.mark}zing with the
enemy]{.underline}, they [[lose]{.mark} their [ability to commit]{.mark}
physical [violence]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Of course, I was wrong. There was no evidence that [any feminist
critiques had ever reached the ears, much less the minds, of these
men]{.underline}. [[**American military dependence** on nuc]{.mark}lear

talk of nuclear disarmament as perfectly resistable, not to mention
foolish. If disarmament is emasculation, how could any real man even

#### The 1AC mirrors masculinist technostrategic discourse that sanitizes mass violence through euphemism---its rhetoric obscures the human cost of war with abstract, clinical language that erases feminist critiques and naturalizes domination as rational security policy

Entering the world of [defense intellectuals was a bizarre experience-
bizarre because it is a world where [men spend their days]{.mark} calmly
and matter- of-factly [discussing nuc]{.mark}lear [weapons]{.mark},
nuclear strategy, and nuclear war.]{.underline} The
[discussions]{.underline} are carefully and intricately reasoned,
[occur]{.underline}ring seemingly [[without]{.underline}]{.mark} any
sense of [[horror, urgency, or moral outrage]{.underline}-]{.mark}in
fact, [[there seems to be no **graphic reality**]{.mark} [behind]{.mark}
the words, as they speak of [\"first strikes,\"]{.mark} \"counterforce
exchanges,\" [and]{.mark} [\"limited nuclear war,\" or as they debate
the]{.mark} comparative [values of]{.mark} a \"minimum deterrent
posture\" versus a [\"nuclear]{.mark} [war-fighting
capability.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}

Yet what is striking about the men themselves is not, as the content of
their conversations might suggest, their cold-bloodedness. Rather, it is
that they are a group of men unusually endowed with charm, humor,
intelligence, concern, and decency. Reader, I liked them. At least, I
liked many of them. [[The attempt to]{.underline}]{.mark} understand how
such men could [[contribute to an endeavor]{.mark} that I see as
[so]{.mark} [fundamentally destructive]{.mark} became a continuing
obsession for me, a lens through which I came to examine all of my
experiences in their world.]{.underline}

In this early stage, I was gripped by the extraordinary language used to
discuss nuclear war. What hit me first was [[the]{.mark} elaborate [use
of **abstraction and euphemism**]{.mark}, of words so bland that they
[never]{.mark} forced the speaker or [enabled the listener to touch the
realities of nuclear holocaust]{.mark} that lay behind the
words.]{.underline}

Anyone who has seen [pictures of Hiroshima burn victims or tried to
imagine the pain of hundreds of glass shards blasted into flesh may find
it perverse beyond imagination to hear a class of [nuclear]{.mark}
[devices]{.mark} matter-of- factly [referred to as \"clean
bombs]{.mark}.\" \"Clean bombs\"]{.underline} are nuclear devices that
are largely fusion rather than fission and that therefore release a
higher quantity of energy, not as radiation, but as blast, as
destructive explosive power.7 [\"Clean bombs\" may provide the perfect
metaphor for the language of defense analysts and arms controllers.
[This language has enormous **destructive power**]{.mark}, but [without
emotional fallout]{.mark}, without the emotional fallout that would
result if it were clear one was talking about plans for mass murder,
mangled bodies, and unspeakable human suffering. Defense]{.underline}
analysts talk about \"countervalue attacks\" rather than about
incinerating cities. Human death, in nuclear parlance, is most often
referred to as \"collateral damage\"; for, as one defense analyst said
wryly, \"The Air Force doesn\'t target people, it targets shoe
factories.\"8

Some phrases carry this cleaning-up to the point of inverting meaning.
[The MX missile]{.underline} will carry ten warheads, each with the
explosure power of 300-475 kilotons of TNT: one missile the bearer of
destruction approx- imately 250-400 times that of the Hiroshima
bombing.9 Ronald [[Reagan]{.underline}]{.mark} has

[[dubbed the MX missile \"**the Peacekeeper**]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}
While this renaming was the object of considerable scorn in the
community of defense analysts, these very same analysts refer to the MX
as a \"damage limitation weapon.\"\'? These phrases, only a few of the
hundreds that could be discussed, exemplify the astounding chasm between
image and reality that character- izes technostrategic language[.
[They]{.mark} also [hint at the]{.mark} terrifying [way]{.mark} in which
[the existence of nuclear devices has **distorted**]{.mark} **[our
perceptions]{.mark}** [and rede- fined the world]{.mark}. \"Clean
bombs\" tells us that radiation is the only \"dirty\" part of killing
people.]{.underline} To take this one step further, such phrases can
even seem healthful/ curative/corrective. So that we not only have
\"clean bombs\" but also \"surgically clean strikes\" (\"counterforce\"
attacks that can purportedly \"take out\"-i. e., accurately destroy-an
opponent\'s weapons or command cen- ters without causing significant
injury to anything else). The image of excision of the offending weapon
is unspeakably ludicrous when the surgi- cal tool is not a delicately
controlled scalpel but a nuclear warhead. And somehow it seems to be
forgotten that even scalpel

The [[militarisation-patriarchy interface]{.mark} of the state gets
[**reflected** in non-state structures]{.mark}]{.underline}, ideologies
and movements, unless they specifically challenge these. In turn,
right-wing fundamentalist movements use them to mobilise people for
political purposes. So [[**anything** can get militarised,]{.mark}
whether it is commodities, relations between people or
religion]{.underline}. For instance, the 5 per cent surcharge during the
India-Pakistan Kargil conflict instilled the message of war to the
consumer of daily commodities. There has been a concerted attempt to
militarise Hinduism. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad's (VHP) (the extreme
right-wing international Hindu organisation that is based on a political
formulation of Hinduism) international vice-president Giriraj Kishore
has stated that Hindu ideologue V. Savarkar's dictum on militarising
Hindus should be put into action, since, according to him this was the
route to oppose Islamic fundamentalism (Hindus tan Times,1 1 July 2002).
[Hindus were reminded that they are worshippers of goddesses like
Mahashakti and Kali, and of Shiva, who are represented with weapons in
their hands. They were [exhorted]{.mark}: 'Hindus! If you [want to
**preserve** your existence, you should **arm** yourself]{.mark} with
different [weapons]{.mark} dear to gods and goddesses.' This was
[necessary to overcome 'weakness, timidity and
**unmanliness**]{.mark}**'** that ['are great sins]{.mark}, and bravery
and masculinity of great punya-virtue']{.underline} (Shah 2002:
82\--85). [Such [a call legitimises arms and violence]{.mark} and its
[conflation with]{.mark} macho power and [patriarchal]{.mark}
[principles]{.mark} is evident]{.underline}

The Hindu right militarised elections, and the election campaign (1-12
December 2002) in Gujarat under the leadership of Chief Minister
Narendra Modi saw Pakistan and General Musharraf as his main opponent.
He alleged that a victory for the Congress Party would be a victory for
Pakistan, thereby making the minorities, the Congress Party, the liberal
intelligentsia or any opposition the disloyal enemy, the Other. The
VHP's general secretary Pravin Togadia then passed 'the sentence' when
he said, 'All those who opposed Hindutva philosophy would like cancer
patients, live under death sentence, which would be executed by the
people' (Times of India,18 December 2002). Militarisation of civil
society is clearly essential since it extends the militarisation of the
state.

[[Women get militarised]{.mark} and [use it to **derive**
agency]{.mark}, even though it is women who suffer from it the
most.]{.underline} Denise Kandiyoti (1998:136) explains how [[women use
violence to **gain agency**]{.mark} by evolving the concept of the
**'patriarchal bargain'**. Though she uses this notion with issues
concerning the household, Kandiyoti traces the link between promises of
protection and women's choices. Women get militarised and accept the use
of force to derive agency. They believe that [they too can achieve a
position of power if they use]{.mark} the instruments of [masculinity
even though it means **hurting women**]{.mark} and maintaining status
through the use of force.]{.underline}

For example, women cadres of the Sangh Parivar' proved equal to men in
leading rioting mobs during the Gujarat carnage of March 2002 (PUCL
2002). These women were trained in a militarist nationalist discourse
that identified the Muslim minority as the enemy Other. They sought to
challenge their own oppression by being violent aggressors and leaders
of mobs. But women remain the targets of such militarisation and militia
in multiple ways, as the works of feminist writers have shown (Copeland
1998: 63; Enloe 1998: 50).

[[Accepting militarisation means that women have to **accept** the codes
of **masculine**]{.mark} and 'muscular' politics [where they cannot be
equal on their own terms]{.mark}.]{.underline} Only recently militants
in Kashmir gunned down women who did not wear the veil (burqa) (Indian
Express, 21 December 2002). Global militarism thrives with the creation
of heroes and victims. Women as victims have always been built into a
positive ideology by religions and nationalism where self-sacrifice is
seen as the high virtue of womanhood. This is more so when she is the
wife of a hero/martyr (Mukta 2000: 170). The essentialist contrast is
more clearly imprinted on public memory and is useful in constructing
the Other and in binding the nation.

It is [through the [messages of nationalism]{.mark} that civil [society
can be militarised]{.mark}. Women are an important agency in
militarising civil I society and as carriers of the message of a
militant nationalism. The [nation itself is **symbolised** as a
woman]{.mark}, for example, Bharat Mata or Mother India. This symbolism
helps evoke the most fundamental of all imageries. It is in this context
that the forces that use militant nationalism]{.underline}, like the
Sangh Parivar in India, have insisted on using the patriotic song Vande
Mataram ('Hail Mother').' 7 This song and the images it evokes of the
nation as a mother are used by the Sangh as a slogan, and even as a
greeting in their morning assemblies. [With this, [women's bodies are
**identified** with national **territory**,]{.mark} to be protected and
**[to be possessed]{.mark}**, just as [the **Other** or enemy territory
(**symbolised** also by the **woman**]{.mark}-mother image body) [has to
be **violated and dispossessed.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Globalisation, [militarism and patriarchy intersect in multiple ways: as
globalisation breaks down barriers for markets, capital, goods,
technology and information transfers-primarily]{.underline} in a
unilateral direction-it gradually undermines the role of the state as an
economic agent[. [As state]{.mark} activity [weakens]{.mark} or
compromises [in the economic sphere]{.mark}, [its]{.mark} capacity and
**[control]{.mark}** are [often diverted to other areas]{.mark} like
national security and [the control of dissenting minorities, and
movements for rights, **including women's
movements**.]{.mark}]{.underline} This privileging of national security
like war is a gendering activity. All members of society are gendered
whether they be men or women or whether they are combatants or
non-combatants. [Since the less privileged suffer unequally, in such
circumstances the **oppression** of the less privileged
**increases**.]{.underline} Two recent examples from the Afghanistan and
Iraq wars show how militarised conflicts affect gender.

[[Feminist challenges to **masculinist technological
determinism**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Early virtual activism in [[feminist international relations
theory]{.mark} and [practice]{.mark} highlighted all these areas and
more, and their significance is only underlined further at a time when
**[technoagency]{.mark}** is increasingly to the fore]{.underline} as
part of the attention to pluses and minuses of AI applications and
[future innovation pathways driven by them]{.underline}. [Policy and
public debates]{.underline} on these areas have **[[expanded
awareness]{.underline}]{.mark}** that
[[technologies]{.underline}]{.mark} are [not neutral]{.underline} and
that they need to be understood as [[substantially]{.underline}]{.mark}
reflecting, supporting and working to [[perpetuate dominant **power
structures**]{.underline}]{.mark}, interests and values. The fear factor
about negative impacts, actual or potential, threatens to preponderate
in such circumstances in the [[absence of]{.mark} sufficiently [strong
**counter-narratives**]{.mark}]{.underline} emphasizing [[empowering
dimensions of technoagency]{.underline}]{.mark}. The history of
[masculinist technological determinism]{.underline} has weaknesses in
this area because of the way it [embeds technological
advances]{.underline} within the [[governing]{.mark} model of
[male-dominated **economic growth**]{.mark} in modernity]{.underline}.
This [paradigm]{.underline} is largely responsible for [[framing
technology]{.mark} as [neutral and masculinist forms of
**progress**]{.mark} inherently defined by it as given]{.underline}.
Over time the [[embedded]{.mark} nature of this schema [in
structures]{.mark} and processes of political economy]{.underline} has
resulted in an [[entrenched]{.mark} and **[complex ideology]{.mark}**
shrouding and [insulating]{.mark} the specifics of [technological
progress]{.mark} in theory and practice from open and critical
interrogation]{.underline}. [Feminist perspectives]{.underline} are a
[powerful corrective]{.underline} in their [[challenges]{.mark} to
multiple [assumptions]{.mark} underpinning [masculinist technological
determinism]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is notable that this power is drawn
from both theory and highly diverse forms of practice, including
activism, advocacy and the building of networks, knowledge and
communities. The dual nature of applying theory to practice and theory
being informed and enriched by what is learned during this application
is an [[illuminating]{.mark} characteristic of [feminist **digital
engagement**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The Women on the Net (WoN) project (see Chapter 7) launched in the 1990s
and supported by UNESCO and the Society for International Development
demonstrated this through, for instance: extensive online networking
linked to a raft of knowledge and community-building activities
including face-to-face working group meetings and conference
contributions; partnerships with grassroots organizations to undertake
hands-on discovery and development work with women on their digital
needs and interests; pamphlets and policy briefing material on women's
digital empowerment in global contexts; numerous research publications,
including in book and article form (see Figure 6.1). This was a
ground-breaking project in the diversity and breadth of its participants
and audiences as well as both its practice-based and theoretical
outputs. It was also one of the first international undertakings of its
kind to involve predominantly women, but also men, from Africa, Asia
Pacific, Latin America, North America, the Middle East and Europe. Those
involved crossed generations and sectors and included academics, activ-
ists, policymakers, social entrepreneurs and innovators, community
leaders and members, technologists and creatives. The focus of the
project in simple terms was women and cyberspace, with equal emphasis on
both. While it involved [[exploration of **sociospatial**]{.mark}
opportunities with women]{.underline}, it was equally [[**oriented**
towards discovering]{.mark} their different perspectives]{.underline} on
those opportunities, especially their priorities as users and potential
users of ICTs and their digital literacy needs and preferences. WoN was
concerned with [[open exploration]{.mark} of how a highly diverse
international range of women viewed sociospatial
possibilities]{.underline}, including why, how and for what purposes
they found or would find it useful to be online and how this informed
their own and wider thinking about digital empowerment. One fascinating
dimension of WoN was that it preceded the explosion of social media and
the immediacy of instant messaging, so the majority of the online com-
munication was undertaken via multitudinous email exchanges and mostly
among women who had not yet met face to face. One point of discussion
later, when face-to-face gatherings happened, was how individual women
had imagined one another having had only virtual contact up to that
time. Not surprisingly, this led to some interesting exchanges related
to embodiment, identity and meanings around online presence and
communication. Other topics of discussion resulting from the extensive
nature of the online threads included: language-based and other
inhibitions that can arise in multicultural communication and challenges
of sharing thoughts in online group settings; problems of ensuring
clarity of intended mean- ings in emails and addressing unexpected
misunderstandings; possible negative impacts of members lurking in group
messages without participating. WoN was distinctive for operating firmly
in [multiple]{.underline} and multi-locational [geospatial and
sociospatial international contexts]{.underline}. It is valuable to
reflect on the extent to which these multifaceted combinations of
offline and online components of the project over time were pivotal to
the richness of its outputs related to [**[cyberculture]{.mark}**
generally [and women]{.mark} and cyberculture in
particular]{.underline}. Overall the points raised here on the project
[[illustrate]{.underline}]{.mark} its deep [[connection to identity and
technoagency issues]{.underline}]{.mark} (see Chapter 8), including
central contributions of group dimensions and cross-cultural exchange.

WoN featured productive fusions of online and offline elements involving
varied virtual and in-person interactions, and while it supported paths
to digital empowerment, it was far from taking familiar parameters of
masculinist technological determinism as given and the full story.
Instead it charted fresh terrain focused on women's lived realities,
priorities and interests, and their shared knowledge about those as well
as about networks across the world working for women's digital con-
nectivity and engagement. It is informative to look back at the WoN
project and its emphasis on cross-cultural knowledge and
community-building in the local/ [global [framework]{.mark}]{.underline}
of the geospatial/[sociospatial]{.underline} nexus
[pre-dating]{.underline} the social media saturation of current times.
Experiments like WoN highlight the enabling power of Internet use for
both [[**accessing** existing knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark} sources and
[[**generating** new forms of knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark}, as well as
for building networks and communities even at distance through
sociospatial means across very [[different **geospatial** and
**socioeconomic** settings]{.underline}]{.mark}. The present-day
diversity of social media platforms offering a wide range of instant
(asynchronous and synchronous) text, image and video forms of
connectivity would have been transformative for the operation of pro-
jects like WoN. This [[prompts]{.underline}]{.mark} reflection on
whether the [[dominant market forces]{.underline}]{.mark} of this now
well-established social media age have intensified too greatly everyday
speed-driven [interactive [micro-communications and
consumption]{.mark}]{.underline} as the kingpins of online experience in
terms of amounts of time and priority given to them, the result being
far too much attention drawn away from more self-directed and
intentional online uses and the Internet's less instantaneously oriented
[informational and knowledge-based affordances]{.underline}. Social
media platforms have undoubtedly aided the exponential growth of online
communities but are these often too superficial and marketized through
numerically assessed 'likes' and 'hits' -- algorithmically rather than
purposefully generated through individual or group agency?

ICT = Information and Communication Technology

It can be argued that the hyper-rational character of the information
age, where ICTs become more and more integral to societies' operations
at structural and individual levels, makes technologies central to
ontological debates.

[The implications of the arguments developed above are that technologies
are inseparable from the ways in which states and societies
operate,]{.underline} including via major institutions, and the ways in
which power is exercised (including across public/private boundaries)
and experienced. In an information age how can we think about what
societies are without interrogating the intricate functions that
technologies play within them? It used to be feasible to think more in
terms of technologies related to various sectors such as different parts
of industry. Now ICTs operate far more pervasively to structure
organizational and communications processes and to facilitate production
and consumption, as well as being objects of that production and
consumption. [Thinking about technology has to move ahead to reflect
these fundamental shifts.]{.underline}

[The reach and competencies of the surveillance state and its many
agents have been substantially extended by technological innovations,
and more importantly, they are likely to go on being so.]{.underline}
The existence and operation of ICTs have changed the nature of the
surveillance state, not least by facilitating its reach into the
minutiae of everyday movements and communications as a matter of course.
The technologically enhanced automaticity of surveillance in a society
like the United Kingdom has made individual privacy a more compromised
commodity than prior to the information era.

I would argue that the established tendency of mainstream academic and
policy approaches to treat technology exogenously as a tool makes
navigating the ethics of this situation problematic. As I explored in
the previous section of this chapter, exogenous approaches fail to
promote deep critique of technological processes' social impacts and
meanings. Treating technologies as neutral does not encourage us to look
at the specificities of their capacities and ethical dilemmas that they
represent. [And of course [in the ICT world we are]{.mark} not just
[talking about hardware,]{.mark} we are talking about [intelligent
software]{.mark}, which in [artificial intelligence]{.mark} mode, is
often what is most responsible for enabling automaticity.]{.underline}

[[Feminist perspectives]{.mark} are one useful starting point for
developing endogenous (socially grounded) understandings of
technology.]{.underline} [Their specific contributions link to the kinds
of ontological concerns prominent in this discussion, because they
[address how technologies reflect]{.mark} the [dominant gendered power
characteristics]{.mark} of [societies]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[**Science
and technology** have been characterized as]{.mark} not only [the
**highest forms of (rational) knowledge**]{.mark} but also historically,
[and]{.mark} to a large extent contemporaneously, [as **primarily
masculine** realms]{.mark}. The [implications]{.mark} of this [include
**dominant** **tendencies towards gendered binary divisions** in society
that construct]{.mark} men and [masculine identities and agency as
'naturally' inhabiting]{.mark} the [realms of science]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} [technology,]{.mark} [and]{.mark} women and [feminine
identities as outside of them]{.mark}]{.underline} (for a range of
related debates see, for example: Harding 1991; Kirkup and Smith Keller
1992; Youngs 2000). [Furthermore, they probe the (white)
Western-centrism of the modern/postmodern masculinist technological
paradigm generated as it is from a history of Western
hegemony]{.underline} (see Harding 2008).

**[[Feminist critiques]{.mark} are powerful]{.underline}** [in
challenging a 'naturalized' view of masculinist science and
technology]{.underline} by considering their particularities rather than
assuming their universal relevance. [These **critiques [interrogate the
masculinist epistemologies]{.mark}** [of scientific traditions as
expressive of male domination within societies and the prioritization of
masculinist knowledge over marginalized (feminized and colonized) forms
of knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline} (see Harding 1998. See also Harcourt
1994). One of the major areas of [critique of such forms of [masculinist
knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline} [is]{.mark} their
**[disembodied]{.mark}** qualities: [their abstractions [that take
emphasis away from embodied **lived
experience**]{.mark}]{.underline}[**.** [Feminist perspectives emphasize
the priority of embodied approaches that]{.underline}]{.mark} [take
direct [**account** of such experience in]{.mark} [understanding social
processes, including]{.mark} importantly ones that are
[technologically]{.mark} mediated]{.underline} (see Youngs 2000. See
also Harcourt 2009). And it is almost impossible to think of any domain
of life which is not technologically mediated: work, travel, warfare,
health, leisure, to name just a few:

Technology is a neologism. Only in the 1930s did technology become a
keyword of American grammar and an all encompassing concept that could
explain human life itself. It then came to denote the useful application
of scientific knowledge for the benefit of humankind, and engineers were
designated as the sole bearers of that form of knowledge. [Rather than a
neutral term, technology is itself part of a narrative production or
plot of modernism, in which men are protagonists and women have been
denied their part]{.underline}. (Oldenziel 1999: 14 -- italics in the
original)

#### Industrial masculinity justifies it's prioritization of economic and technological growth over the environment by framing development as masculine accomplishments and the environment as feminine by nature. This leads to the environmental death and turns all the evd about econ decline outweighing because its blinded and structured by the industrial Masculine.

4.3 Development, Growth and the Environment

[In distancing itself from nature, [industrial masculinity]{.mark} is
[constructed through accomplishments based on]{.mark} positive
[masculine features such as **power, strength and
intelligence**]{.mark}.]{.underline} If [hard industries are dying,
these accomplishments must come from]{.underline} the development of
[other [traditionally **masculine interests**, such as
technology]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} But two types of
masculinity are constructed on the basis of technological development.
Demonstrating that technology is fundamental to masculinity, it is also
key to eco-modern masculinity[,]{.underline} which developed out of
1970's ecological masculinity as opposition to industrial masculinity
(Hultman 2016:5). It "demonstrated caring and responsibility for the
environment while, at the same time promoting economic growth and
technological expansion" (Anshelm & Hultman 2014:92). [[Promoting
economic growth and technological expansion is]{.mark} as we shall see
[fundamental to]{.mark} the renewed **[industrial
masculinity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But its lack of demonstrated caring
and responsibility for the environment is what separates it from
eco-modern masculinity. Regardless, [[technological development and
growth is key, so much so that it sees it as the way to build of the
future]{.underline}]{.mark} (GOP 2016:5). Republicans easily conflate
technological development with environmental conservation, but never
explicitly. It sees that "agriculture is directly impacted by the
constant advance in technology" (ibid.:18) having half a page before
announced that "Farmers and ranchers ... among this country's most
leading conservationists." (ibid.)

It is interesting to note that Republicans seem to suggest there is a
space for government interference to advance the protection of nature
through technological development:

> Modern farm practices and technologies, supported by programs from the
> Department of Agriculture, have led to reduced erosion, improved water
> and air quality, increased wildlife habitat, all the while maintaining
> improved agricultural yields (ibid.)

Noteworthy here is that the advancement of [technology is mainly in
focus. Environmental protection is simply a fortunate by-product of the
important agricultural yields]{.underline}. Large-scale technological
achievement is a recurring theme in the Platform. It seems to be the
solution to renewable energy: "Our nuclear industry, cleanly generating
almost 20 percent of our electricity from its 99 plants, has a
remarkable safety record." (ibid.:19)

The emphasis on energy as being clean would have been more significant
in this context had not coal also been referred to as such on the same
page. Clean seems to be a word used for appearance rather than
substance. [But [technology is opposed to nature]{.mark} in more subtle
ways]{.underline}. The Platform also suggests that "\[p\]ermitting for a
safe, non-polluting hydroelectric facility ... can take many years
because of the current President's hostility to dams" (ibid.). Here the
GOP invokes safety and nonpollution as central to their own concerns and
relates it to technological achievement. But it is a false image. By
reiterating the importance of allowing "responsible development of
nuclear energy" (ibid:20) the GOP seemingly ignores the very possible
threat that nuclear power also poses to nature. But technological
development requires investment. Which is why it is interesting to see
Republicans suggesting that "Poverty, not wealth, is the gravest threat
to the environment, while steady economic growth brings the
technological advances which make environmental progress possible."
(ibid.:21).

This demonstrates the artfulness of the Platform in weaving together
economic and technological development and growth seamlessly. By
relating environmental protection to technological development through
growth, Republicans suggest [[growth can only come if environmental
protection is less stringent, which enables]{.mark} more [technological
development. It holds nature as a **symbolic hostage** to economic
progress]{.mark} and future technology.]{.underline}

Opposing nature and government to people and economic growth is the most
frequent theme in the Platform. Republicans concern for Keystone XL
Pipeline clearly demonstrates this. The previous administration's
blocking of the pipe carrying oil from Canada to the U.S has according
to Republicans "\[...\] become a symbol in the contest between the
public's desire for economic development and the government's hostility
to growth." (ibid.:50)

It is suggested that the government is opposed to the people as well as
economic growth and prosperity. Yet it was the people protesting that
led the U.S state department to halt it due to environmental concerns
(BBC, 2017).

Whether it is the protection of nature or animals, the view of the
environment as opposed to growth and technological development keeps
reappearing. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is seen as having stunted
economic development, halted the construction of projects, burdened
landowners \[....\] (GOP 2016:22). The protection of endangered species
is not a worthwhile goal on its own, if it cannot be financially
motivated: The ESA should ensure that the listing of endangered species
and the designation of critical habitats are based upon sound science
and balance the protection of endangered species with the costs of
compliance and the rights of property owners. (ibid.) The view of
natural resources as predominantly a source of income is perhaps most
clearly evidenced in the beginning of the Agriculture, Energy and
Environment chapter: We are the party of America's growers, producers,
farmers, ranchers, foresters, miners, commercial fishermen, and all
those who bring from the earth the crops, minerals, energy and the
bounties of our seas that are the lifeblood of our economy. (emphasis
added) (ibid:17) Bounty may mean either bonus or monetary reward, and
resources are the lifeblood of many economies. Yet, it is another piece
of the puzzle demonstrating how emphasising growth commodifies nature.
This view is not limited to Republicans but is strongly advocated by
them and as such strengthens a narrative wherein "\[t\]he idea of
unlimited growth \[...\] is based on a lie that there is an infinite
supply of the earths goods, and this leads to the planet being squeezed
dry at every limit." (Godfrey in Godfrey & Torres 2016:49). The
preoccupancy with economic progress returns in Trump's budget proposal.
Government agencies, particularly the EPA, face deep spending cuts to
incentivise economic growth by redirecting money to infrastructure and
the military (The New York Times, 2017; Fox News, 2017). The
preoccupancy of [[industrial masculinity with development through
economy and technology]{.underline}]{.mark} is almost eco-modern in its
promotion of technology as key to environmental protection. However, it
fails in that [it [commodifies nature, making the environment a source
of enrichment, rather than our shared home]{.mark} by taking into
consideration the economy rather than the well-being of
nature]{.underline}, first: We firmly believe environmental problems are
best solved by giving incentives for human ingenuity and the development
of new technologies, not through top-down, command-and-control
regulations that stifle economic growth and cost thousands of jobs. (GOP
2016:22)

There is no place in conservative discourse for seeing [[nature]{.mark}
as our whole world and home]{.underline}. Instead[, [it is an obstacle
to growth]{.mark} and development]{.underline}, the answer to our
problems [[according to industrial masculinity]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Technological advancement may seem like a move towards environmental
protection and is a promising turn away from fossil fuels. But
technological development of safe renewable sources is practically
omitted from the text. Wind and solar is only mentioned briefly. With
emphasis on cost-effectiveness and private capital, Republicans seem
concerned with money rather than renewable energy as they "\[...\]
encourage the cost-effective development of renewable energy sources --
wind, solar, biomass, biofuel, geothermal, and tidal energy -- by
private capital." (ibid.:20) The phrasing suggests a desire to remain
free from state interference. This would make it harder on new
investments in renewable energy since hard industries are already
economically and politically established and profitable. It also
suggests that renewable energy does not fit in with the image of
large-scale technological developments that showcase intelligence,
strength, hard work and efficiency, fundamental to the society
industrial masculinity built (Winter 2010: Appendix Table 6).
Prioritizing large-scale engineering is the most visible way in which
the [GOP [Platform clearly deprioritizes nature as
femininity]{.mark},]{.underline} in favour of technology and progress of
human civilization. Another example of this is the suggestion that the
U.S "phase out the federal transit program and reform provisions of the
Environmental Policy Act which can delay and drive up costs for
transportation projects" (GOP 2016:5). Republicans seek to cut funding
for environmentally friendly transportation methods by suggesting that
"\[e\]veryone agrees on the need for clean water and safe roads, rails,
bridges, ports and airports." (ibid:4). This is in keeping with Trump's
newly proposed budget with increases in infrastructure spending, offset
by cuts in environmental protection. This is interesting because it has
a gendered impact on the gap in American public transport. Women use
public transport far more, and more often, than men, despite often being
afraid to do so. It is often a forced choice driven by unequal
employment opportunities resulting in women often being trapped in
lowpaying jobs that make car ownership difficult, or traditional gender
roles leading to the man utilizing the car, or a concern for the
environment (CityLab, 2015; Bell 2016:5). But progress is not only a
positive value in industrial masculinity nor in conservativism.

When it concerns the private life such as family and social values,
tradition is critical. By tradition, nature is god-given and "...the
Republican Party reaffirms the moral obligation to be good stewards of
the God-given natural beauty and resources of our country." (GOP
2016:20). Nature as god-given seems to be the same view it has of
marriage, as "between one man and one woman, is the foundation for a
free society and has for millennia been entrusted with rearing children
and instilling cultural values" (ibid.:11). The gender role hypothesis
of marriage suggests women have historically been unequal in traditional
marriage as wife and mother compared to their male counterpart
(Strohschein, 2016). If true in the U.S as in India, this traditional
institution upon which culture is based, reproduces a fundamentally
unequal society in which men are owners and stewards of both women and
nature. The devaluation of femininity then inherent to traditional
marriage (Strohschein & Ram, 2016) can only mean that the institution
sustains and reproduces hierarchical supremacy of industrial
masculinity. [[Industrial masculinity need **modernized technology** and
traditional values to retain power and ownership over femininity as
nature.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[Comprehending [fossil fuel production requires accounting for its

class.]{.underline} The literature discussing gender within extractive
industries usually refers to women's roles; however, gender as an
analytical tool could and should be broadened to examine the
masculinities and femininities within the oil and gas industry as well
as other intersecting identities and structures. In this paper, the
concept of gender refers to socially constructed identities and
differences between the categories of men and women, which allude to the
characteristics assigned to the categories of masculine and feminine.
These categories are always culturally specific and change over time
(Connell & Pearse, Reference Connell and Pearse2014; Hoogensen Gjørv,
Reference Hoogensen Gjørv, Latola and Savela2017; Tickner, Reference
Tickner2001). Extractive industries have been argued to belong to a
culture of masculinity (Daggett, Reference Daggett2018; Kojola,
Reference Kojola2019; Miller, Reference Miller2004), and they have
historically been rather male dominated. Daggett (Reference Daggett2018)
has forcefully argued that there is a relationship between fossil fuels
and the white patriarchal order, proposing the concept of
petro-masculinity. Miller (Reference Miller2004) has examined the oil
industry in Alberta, Canada, and concluded three aspects constructing
masculinity within the industry: "[[everyday interactions]{.mark} which
[exclude women]{.mark}; [values and beliefs specific to the dominant
occupation of engineering]{.mark} which [reinforce gender
divisions]{.mark}; and [a consciousness derived from]{.mark} the
powerful [symbols of the frontier myth]{.mark} and the romanticized
cowboy hero"]{.underline} (Miller, Reference Miller2004, p.47). [[In the
Arctic, the history of exploration together with the idea of conquering
nature has been updated and transferred to the modern hydrocarbon
industry]{.mark}.]{.underline} [(Female) [gender is missing from the
energyscape]{.mark} in the Barents region]{.underline} (Lempinen,
Reference Lempinen2018). [The imagery and role models visible to the
public to affect perceptions of the industry]{.underline} (European
Institute for Gender Equity, 2016, p.6). [Nevertheless, [the dichotomy
between femininity and masculinity is no longer so simplistic]{.mark}
[within the modern hydrocarbon industry]{.mark} in Norway and Russia,
[or within the Arctic]{.mark}, and "the debate is already moving beyond
such stereotypes and structural limitations"]{.underline} (Vladimirova &
Habeck, Reference Vladimirova and Habeck2018, p.148).

In this article I focus on the justifications utilised to support the
continuing production as well as on the construction of gender. When
analysing the material, it became evident that especially in the Russian
context, the presentation of gender meant a presentation of masculinity,
as the majority of the people presented in the webpages were male.
Connell, a pioneer in masculinity studies, emphasises that we should
discuss masculinities, not masculinity. Multiple masculinities exist
within a certain gender order (Connell, Reference Connell1995) and the
performance on masculinity relies "on maneuvering between several
competing gender regimes which function within historical gender orders"
such as the Soviet and post-Soviet context (Yusupova, Reference
Yusupova2016, p.31). The construction and performance of various
masculinities can be only done within a certain framework laid out by
the state (Yusupova, Reference Yusupova2016). For instance, Vladimir
Putin's "hypermasculinity" is playing a crucial role in the contemporary
re-masculinisation of Russia (Sperling, Reference Sperling2015;
Yusupova, Reference Yusupova2016). Ventsel (Reference Ventsel2018) has
examined the dominant masculinities in Siberia, specifically in the
Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), where the discourse of conquering nature
has deep roots. [In Soviet times, Yakutia was one of the nation's
[resource-extraction frontiers, characterised by a pronounced]{.mark}
proletarian ["hard" masculinity]{.mark} that continued well into the
2000s.]{.underline} [[Recently]{.mark}, according to Ventsel, [more
urban, "softer" masculinities have emerged]{.mark} (Ventsel Reference
Ventsel2018, pp.210--211).]{.underline} [The [masculine identity of an
oil worker that provides for his family is an important incentive to
work in the "extreme" North]{.mark}]{.underline} (Saxinger Reference
Saxinger2015, p.95). However, it is noteworthy that the evolution
towards stricter definition of gender roles can be interpreted as a
result of colonial regimes and modernisation, also in the context of the
Russian (and Norwegian) north (Vladimirova & Habeck, Reference
Vladimirova and Habeck2018; Ziker, Reference Ziker2010), since many
indigenous cultures have traditionally not had binary gender division
and roles.

[[What do masculinities look like in the Nordic context]{.mark},
specifically in Norway?]{.underline} [An interesting concept introduced
by Hultman (Reference Hultman2013) is ecomodern
masculinity.]{.underline} In the 1990s, [[the discourse of
ecomodernism]{.mark} began [to expand globally]{.mark}, [wherein
economic growth provides the basis for transition to a more sustainable
future]{.mark}]{.underline} (Hultman, Reference Hultman2013; Anshelm &
Hultman, Reference Anshelm and Hultman2014). Hultman suggests that with
[[ecomodern masculinity]{.mark}, gender identity [is connected to care
for the environment and economic growth]{.mark}.]{.underline} Anshelm &
Hultman (Reference Anshelm and Hultman2014) noted that [with industrial
masculinity shifting towards ecomodern masculinity, an emphasis on
toughness and hardness is replaced by care and
responsibility.]{.underline} Those ascribing to t[he ne[w ecomodern
masculinity still desire to expand economic growth via technological
progress]{.mark} but do so while simultaneously caring for the
environment]{.underline} (Anshelm & Hultman, Reference Anshelm and
Hultman2014). [The notion of [ecomodern masculinity therefore
encompasses attempts to address environmental problems]{.mark},
especially climate change, [while supporting policies and technologies

Hultman, Reference Anshelm and Hultman2014; Hultman Reference

discourse is strongly present within the claims currently made by Arctic

[**[Masculinist structures]{.underline}** of knowledge and

down, and in certain cases even reversing, all or some [elements of real
change achieved]{.mark} either [through **[feminist
resistance]{.underline}**]{.mark} or wider social impacts. The
[[**hegemonic position of science and technology** as knowledge base and
driver of modernity is a]{.mark} pivotal [part of this]{.mark}
**[masculinist bastion]{.mark}**, [as is the]{.mark} resulting
[technological determinism limiting horizons for thinking about the
future]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Feminist critiques are vital]{.mark} [for
unpacking the]{.mark} full [significance of this
scenario]{.mark}]{.underline} as well as for in-depth understanding of
its constraints on future-scoping. [[Masculinist]{.mark} [science and
technology]{.mark}]{.underline}, or, as it is generally referred to in
full, science, technology, engineering and maths ([[STEM]{.mark}), [is
an abstraction in human ]{.mark}]{.underline}[senses]{.mark} in its
considerable exclusion, historically as well as in the present, [[of
women's and feminine perspectives]{.mark}, insights and priorities. Even
on the surface, while growing numbers of [women]{.mark} are engaged
across STEM, they [continue to be concentrated]{.mark} well [below
leadership ranks]{.mark},]{.underline} and even if this were not the
case, we would be a long way from undermining significantly the
realities of the historically entrenched masculinist domination and its
effects.

[In straightforward respects **[masculinist technological
determinism]{.mark}** means that the world which has resulted from it
[can be considered a particularistic, partial and gendered one]{.mark}
(see Figure 1.1). [It is]{.mark} predominantly [an expression of
**masculinist agency** and signals a future reduced]{.mark} [along those
lines]{.mark}.]{.underline} Its substantial exclusion and
deprioritization of feminine agency through knowledge as well as
practice is noteworthy for many reasons. Not least among these is the
familiar alignment of the masculine with the [[core principle of
rationality in STEM]{.mark} in the binary construction of genders,
[positioning the feminine as the opposite -- irrational]{.mark}
(emotional).]{.underline} This is at the heart of the mutually
reinforcing sets of dominant mainstream masculine/feminine binaries --
subject/object, strong/weak, active/passive, mind/body, thought/emotion,
resilient/vulnerable to name a few. It can be argued that masculinist
technological determinism excludes feminine agency in a
mutually-reinforcing Feminist international relations through a
technospatial lens 7 dual manner and that this partly explains gendered
limits on future-scoping. [[This duality]{.mark} concerns the links
between past, present and future and [is represented by the binding of
**masculinist domination**]{.mark} and [agency to the hegemonic place of
**STEM** as driver of modernity]{.mark}]{.underline}. We are not only
talking here about the world that masculinist STEM has created but the
associated gendered hierarchies countering the possibility for feminine
agency to have influential future-oriented impact.

The paramount role of STEM in modernity, through technologies of
weaponry and the military, production and consumption, infrastructures
and transport, has intensified as we have moved through phases of
industrial into digital economy. This suggests that probing the gendered
power dynamics of STEM and masculinist technological determinism will
only grow in importance.

[[The impacts of]{.mark} [**masculinist technological determinism** have
grown in complexity as developments]{.mark} in industrial [economy sit
alongside those in digital economy]{.mark}, and [patterns of
transformation are shaped by linkages across them]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Evolutionary processes]{.mark} in industrial economy [have]{.mark}
increasingly [been impacted by]{.mark} the [disruptions and affordances
facilitated by **digital developments**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
All-encompassing characteristics of digital economy also raise new
stakes for thought about political economy and social change. Examples
of the breadth of digital impacts make this readily evident in areas as
diverse as: online activism linking global and local communities and the
exponential growth of web-enabled outreach and engagement involving
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and their supporters;
[[cyberattacks on businesses and state-based cyberwarfare and
cyberdefence]{.mark};]{.underline} multiplyingr forms of online
production consumption of goods and services; local and global networks
of professional, [[commercial and personal as well as criminal relations
and practices]{.underline}]{.mark}; virtual experience, play, leisure
and intimacy including gaming, entertainment and internet dating. Varied
and ever-changing forms of online presence, mobility and access are in
play throughout, whether concerning people or entities (for example
states, organizations and businesses), places, information or
opportunities to disrupt for positive or negative effects.
Transformations in reach and speed are core to understanding how digital
infrastructures, systems and activities have evolved, added to and
reshaped aspects of industrial society, as well as introducing
completely new possibilities which could not have been imagined in
earlier industrial times.

Contemporary modernity in its combination of industrial and digital
economy is a result of: the information and communication technologies
(ICTs) revolution through the latter half of the 20th into the 21st
centuries; the arrival of the personal computer and desktop computing;
the Internet and World Wide Web; and the growth of mobile telephony and
computing along with apps so that working, communicating, relating and
consuming on the move is an everyday reality. The [[driving momentum
through]{.mark} all these **[developments]{.mark}** has been [to make
instantaneity increasingly the norm]{.mark} whether in: [devastating
effects of **cyberattacks** on governments, businesses]{.mark} and
[organizations;]{.mark} [**proliferation of fake news** and its
distortions]{.mark} of offline processes; [**micro aggressions** of
cyberstalkers and internet trolling]{.mark}]{.underline}; or, on the
more positive side, global activism against ills such as slavery,
prejudice, political oppression and inequalities of all kinds; the
befriending and romantic possibilities of global gaming and internet
dating; as well as the familial, individual and collegial everyday
contact and intimacy of continuous communication. The embedding of ICTs
in these and other ways has introduced the need to think about economy
and society beyond the industrial model to incorporate fully virtual
phenomena and their implications.

[This perspective also falls in line with Westphalian rigidity,
prominent in global politics. [The]{.mark} overarching [legitimate actor
within Westphalian levels of analysis is the state, conceived as
possessing]{.mark}]{.underline} [sovereign [autonomy]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} the [monopoly on violence]{.mark}. As feminist and
post-colonial scholars have pointed out, [these traits are gendered
masculine]{.mark}.]{.underline} What is more, [[the state's]{.mark}
agency is also conceived in masculine terms: They are [rational]{.mark},
[logical]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} assertive, if not [aggressive]{.mark}.

are on a binary, and [[new terrorists are irrational and]{.mark}
[fanatical]{.mark}, then counter-terrorists become constructed as
rational, logical, and thus, legitimate]{.underline}, credible actors.
Counterterrorism scholarship makes this binary very clear. Throughout
several texts on terrorism and counterterrorism, scholars such as Robert
Pape (2005) and Boaz Ganor (2011) [assert that, while terrorist
leadership ascribes and conforms to a rational decision-maker model,

A [[feminist approach suggests]{.mark} two [additional]{.mark} lines of
[analysis of the war on terror within]{.mark}]{.underline}
IT/[IR]{.underline}: the ways in which the "unmanning" of combat
destabilizes already vexing discussions of women in combat, and its
possible [effects on [hierarchies of **Militarized Hegemonic
Masculinities.**]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}IR feminists have
enriched our understandings of the events of September 11, 2001 and the
war on terror by, for example, highlighting the ways in which a
resurgence of [[masculinity found in]{.mark} the [symbolism
surrounding]{.mark} the events of [September 11]{.mark}, 2001 [denied
women]{.mark} a chance to [participate in]{.mark} the [heroic
confrontation]{.mark}]{.underline} with terrorism, analyzing the use of
women\'s rights as justificatory strategy for the campaign in
Afghanistan, and shedding light on the ways in which high-profile cases
such as those of Jessica Lynch, Shoshana Johnson, Cindy Sheehan, and
Lynndie England acted to gender representations of the war on terror
(Tickner 2002; Sjoberg 2007; Steans 2008). Feminist analysis helps us
understand how [[war on terror discourses rely]{.mark} up[on gender
stereotypes]{.mark}]{.underline} even as they offer problematic ideals
of the women soldier, unsettle our expectations about female violence,
and contribute to the evolution of constructions of militarized
femininity.

Further, IR feminists have shown how [[narratives about (male)
protector]{.mark} and ([female) protected]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the [war
on terror]{.mark} have been "[central]{.mark}]{.underline} to boundary
drawing processes since [[they construct]{.underline}]{.mark} a clear
[division between [the **'war front'**]{.mark}---[a masculinist
domain]{.mark}]{.underline} in which masculinity if affirmed in the
heroic actions performed on the battlefield---[and]{.mark} the [**'[home
front']{.mark}**[---a feminised realm]{.mark} of domesticity and
peace]{.underline}" (Steans 2008, 160). The [unmanning of combat has
complicated these boundary]{.underline} drawing practices greatly,
troubling assumptions about women in combat (questions about women\'s
capability in performing equal roles in combat), the nature of heroism,
as well as problematizing the battlespace/domestic space dichotomy.

Ostensibly, advances in technology should favor women who want to
participate in the armed services allowing them to bypass debates about
the lack of upper-body strength that detractors often claim is a prime
obstacle to their participation. The right to die in combat has
historically been denied to women, and as Tickner observes, "giving
one\'s life for one\'s country has been considered the highest form of
patriotism, but it is an act from which women have been virtually
excluded" (Tickner 1992, 28). Traditionally consigned to domestic
nurturing roles, women have recently gained entry to the military ranks,
only to find positions that may very well be automated in the near
future. In the meantime, however, it is much more difficult to argue
that women lack the inherent physical ability to operate the keyboards
and joysticks that control UAVs or other unmanned weapons. However, the
female tele-operators of unmanned technologies will likely have to guard
against a similar devaluing of their work as took place during their
prominence as computer programmers.

Similarly, the evolving norm of riskless warfare also raises questions
for women. Stiehm (1983) argues that the [[state]{.mark} typically
[denies women]{.mark} the [opportunity to be societal
"protectors]{.mark}," [assigning]{.mark} to [them]{.mark} the [role of
"protected]{.mark}"]{.underline} despite the predatory threat often
posed by their ostensible state guardians. If [military
service]{.underline} is tied to [women\'s status [as
citizen]{.mark}s]{.underline} and opportunities for political
participation, then what effect will the "unmanning" of combat have on
this dynamic? In other words, when soldiers are no longer asked to put
their lives at risk for the state, what becomes of women\'s struggle to
overcome second-class citizenship and solidify the gains seen in the
hardwon privilege of military service? Also, the expansion of unmanned
warfare further frustrates the development of what Judith Stiehm calls a
["defender" society]{.underline}, one "composed of citizens equally
liable to experience violence and equally responsible for exercising
society\'s violence" (1983, 367), [already limited [by a masculinist
state]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[[Drone warfare]{.underline}]{.mark} represents a new stage in what Jean
Elshtain identified as the [American]{.mark} military [policy of
["combatant immunity,]{.underline}]{.mark}["]{.underline} the practice
of "riskless warfare" which relies upon aerial bombing campaigns that
[[punish]{.mark} foreign [noncombatants (especially women and
children]{.mark}]{.underline}) while prioritizing the avoidance of U.S.
casualties (Elshtain 2000, 447). Aside from the ethical issues this
practice raises, it is conceivable that the unmanning of combat will be
interpreted as American cowardice thus prompting perhaps a revision of
notions of heroism and an unsettling of certain American warrior
masculinities. Peter Singer of the Brookings Institute wonders whether
the message the American use of unmanned warfare is sending abroad may
be counterproductive, recounting the Lebanese editor who referred to
Israeli and American users of UAVs as "cowards because they send out
machines to fight us. ... They don\'t want to fight us like real men.
... So we just have to kill a few of their soldiers to defeat them"
(Singer 2009a).

[[Recognition of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [interplay of [masculinities
with technology reveal]{.mark}s [further
developments]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Lauren Wilcox has demonstrated in
her study of offense--defense theory, technologies during World War I
were interpreted, "not on their material contribution to offensive or
defensive combat strategies but instead on their relationship to
[idealized images of soldiers' masculinity bound up in strength,
bravery, and chivalry]{.underline}" (2009, 225). These images of
[warrior masculinity undergo a reconstitution when those prosecuting the
war]{.underline} are tele-present, yet operate at a physical remove,
suggesting new views of how gender works to bring meaning to warfare.
These shifts can be placed in historical perspective, and the unmanning
of warfare, both as an integral part of U.S. military strategy and as
on-going practice in the current military campaign, raises important
questions for hierarchies of masculinity within the armed forces. Steve
Niva argues that the media coverage of the Gulf War of 1990--91 marks a
shift in masculinity, whereby infantrymen "took a backseat in war
coverage to computer programmers, missile technologists, battle-tank
commanders, high-tech pilots, and those appropriately equipped and
educated for new world order warfare" (Niva 1998, 119). For Niva, the
feminization of American manhood caused by the Vietnam War was overcome
by the emergence of a [[new hegemonic military masculinity suited to
technowar conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}, one that "accentuated the
technological and civilizational superiority of the U.S. military and
society" re-asserting the pre-eminence of the Western type of man (1998,
119).

Reconfigurations of masculinity will undoubtedly intersect with
questions of honor and heroism. Feminist scholars have noted the dangers
of abstractions enabled by the use of precision guided munitions,
pointing out how they can foster indifference to the targets and the
illusion of safety, blinding the soldier to the brutality of their
actions (Cohn and Ruddick 2004, 414). The potential for moral
disengagement has long characterized modern warfare, yet the increasing
remove at which war is conducted would seem to have consequences for
some of the values that underwrite the meaning war has for participants.
For instance, the physical safety enjoyed by U.S. drone pilots
complicates honor claims. As one Afghanistan drone pilot comments: "It
sounds strange but being far away and safe is kind of a bummer. The
other guys are exposing themselves, and that to me is still quite an
honorable thing to do. So I feel like I'm cheating them. I'm relatively
safe" (Pitzke 2010). The meaning of heroism under conditions of remote
warfare will likely be subject to renegotiation. In an early indication
of the direction of this transformation, in 2007 Greg Harbin became the
first UAV pilot to receive the Distinguished Flying Cross for piloting
one of the first Predators over Bosnia from his desk in Hungary out of
the path of a school yard of children (Garreau, 2007). Soldiers engaged
in the removal of improvised explosive devices in Iraq also report
forging emotional connections with masculinized, anthromorphized robotic
assistants, giving the robots names, battle commendations, and even
taking them fishing.7 As Tickner, following Elshtain, has noted, a
society\'s war stories are key to galvanizing support for the war
effort; these stories depend on heroism, strength, and other qualities
characterized as masculine (2001, 56--57). What remains to be seen is in
what ways tele-operated combat can continue to be subject to heroic
narrativization.

These configurations of masculinity may need to be negotiated amidst
widening notions of what constitutes "battlespace." Media reports of the
drone program have focused on the ways in which the frontlines of war
have seeped into the domestic space. Representations have highlighted
the domestic lives of Nevada [[UAV pilots]{.underline}]{.mark},
particularly the ways in which these remote operators are [[susceptible
to stress and psychological problems]{.underline}]{.mark} seen in
"normal" combat participants (Zucchino 2010). Adjustment to this
[[encroachment of]{.mark} the [battlespace]{.mark}
[on]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[domestic space]{.mark} may [increase the
burden]{.mark}s [on]{.mark} (typically [female) care-givers]{.mark} on
the homefront, while [adding]{.mark} the [potential]{.mark} for
**[domestic violence]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Further, the circulation of
images of war over networks arguably expands the space of war without
prompting reflection on the ethical effects of mediated proximity. The
circulation of "war porn"---official (and unsanctioned) battlefield
videos taken from the Afghanistan and Iraq conflicts from UAV cameras
often accompanied by heavy metal music and violent commentary---has
become a troubling form of domestic entertainment. Critics argue these
one-sided video representations "with a videogame sensibility ...
fetishize---and warp---the most brutal parts of these high-tech wars"
(Ramirez 2010).

### 2NC\-\--L\-\--Nuclear War

#### The 1AC's technostrategic discourse invests in nuclear weapons as an object of fantasy instead of horror. [Feminist criticism]{.underline} is key to understanding security cooperation as constituted by [subject formation]{.underline} and not merely "[rational strategy.]{.underline}"

According to the first criticism, [the prevalence of [sexual
metaphors]{.mark} and phallic images [in]{.mark} public [discourse about
nuclear weapons]{.mark} provide a means "to create [excitement]{.mark}
about, support for and identification with both the weapons and the
political regime possessing them"]{.underline} (Duncanson and Eschle
2008, 548). For instance, feminist scholars Cohn and Ruddick (2004, 415,
418) argue that [nuclear "weapons (and their use) are theorized and
legitimated" with alluring and exciting sexual metaphors, which
["breed]{.mark} the [idea]{.mark} that [nuclear explosions give
'virility']{.mark} to the nation."]{.underline} Keep in mind that
[feminists make this argument about societies and national security
discourses, this is not a point targeted at Dr. Strangelove. However, it
certainly reflects a strange love. One standard popular and well-known
reference about phallic imagery is antinuclear activist]{.underline}
Helen [Caldicott's]{.underline} (1986, 238) [notion of ["missile envy"
and "the psychosexual overtones"]{.mark} of nuclear weapons
terminology.]{.underline} However, the empirical and theoretical work of
feminist scholar Carol Cohn is especially important on this theme. Cohn
(1987, 688) spent 1984 "immersed in the world of defense intellectuals"
as a "participant observer" in workshops and lectures focused on nuclear
strategy, weapons, and arms control. Since that time, she has also
devoted much of her career to studying nuclear weapons, strategy, and
gender. [Cohn]{.underline} (1987, 687, 696) [found that the men, "and
indeed, they are virtually all men," who work as ["defense
intellectuals"]{.mark} typically [employ]{.mark} language filled with
["sexual imagery."]{.mark}]{.underline} In a lengthy and much-cited
article about her experiences among defense intellectuals, Cohn points
out numerous examples of sexual images and language, [including standard
references to penetration, throw-weight, and spasm attacks]{.underline}
(see also Sylvester 1994, 176). Additionally, Cohn (1987, 694) noted
that "The history of the atomic bomb project itself is rife with overt
images of competitive male sexuality, as is the discourse of the early
nuclear physicists, strategists, and SAC commanders." Based on his
extensive personal experience in the field, nuclear physicist Brian
Easlea (1987, 146) likewise acknowledged that [military scientists and
nuclear strategists employ "frightening" and even "obscene" sexual
[metaphors]{.mark} in an effort [to "demonstrate]{.mark} indisputable
[masculine status."]{.mark}]{.underline}

As demonstrated in the prior section, [Dr. Strangelove is certainly
filled with sexual metaphors and phallic images. Again, "all of the
major characters have names which are either explicitly or subtly
sexually denotative]{.underline}" (Linden 1977, 76). In addition to the
phallic images already noted, General Ripper's scenes often include this
imagery. Notably, Ripper smokes a large phallic cigar in his meeting
with Group Captain Mandrake, which Kubrick made much more prominent by
use of another low-angled camera shot. Later, Ripper fires a long
cylindrical machine gun, another phallic symbol, when his base comes
under attack from American forces trying to learn the codes to recall
the bombers and stop the war he has initiated. In the ending, as Starck
(2010, 61) notes, Major Kong's "positioning on the rocket \[he
straddles\] and the camera angle produce the impression of a giant
penis." Film scholar M. Keith Booker (2007, 103--4) echoes the feminist
critique when he argues that [Kubrick's repeated use of sexual images
and metaphors work to characterize "the Cold War as a phallic
competition" as the military leaders attempt to demonstrate that they
"have the bigger and more effective weapons."]{.underline}

[The second strand of the feminist critique of nuclear weapons focuses
on the **["technostrategic"]{.mark}** (Cohn 1987, 690n)
**[abstractions]{.mark}** employed by specialists working in the field.
The language of defense intellectuals is peppered with euphemisms and
acronyms that [leave out]{.mark} "the emotional, the concrete, the
particular, human bodies and their vulnerability, **[human lives
and]{.mark} their [subjectivity]{.mark}**---all of which are marked
feminine"]{.underline} (Cohn, Hill and Ruddick 2005, 5). [In Dr.
Strangelove,]{.underline} this is most apparent in the language of
General Turgidson, who speaks almost nonchalantly to President Muffley
about the potential death of "ten to twenty million killed, tops." In
this passage, [Turgidson speaks obliquely about the number of American
lives that would be lost after Soviet retaliation to a US first strike.
His additional description of the nuclear attack on the Soviet Union is
just as abstract, not at all focused on the mass murder that would be
committed:]{.underline}

> Mr. President, about thirty-five minutes ago, General Jack Ripper, the
> commanding General of Burpleson Air Force Base, issued an order to the
> 34 B-52's of his wing which were airborne at the time as part of a
> special exercise we were holding called Operation Dropkick. Now, it
> appears that the order called for the planes to attack their targets
> inside Russia. The planes are fully armed with nuclear weapons with an
> average load of 40 megatons each. . . . The aircraft will begin
> penetrating Russian radar cover within 25 minutes.

In response, President Muffley, an effeminate male character, does
describe such an attack as mass murder and reminds Turgidson that the
United States had "avowed . . . never to strike first with nuclear
weapons."8 Turgidson notes technocratically that "General Ripper has
already invalidated that policy." In addition to these exchanges, much
of the military dialogue in the film is filled with mysterious and
abstract acronyms, including the scene on the B-52 when Major Kong and
his crew review the nuclear attack profile.9 They discuss the CRM114,
the ICBM complex at Laputa, and a secondary target at "November Bravo
X-Ray One Zero Eight."

The third strand of the feminist critique is that [[nuclear language
relies upon gendered]{.mark}, specifically masculine, [axioms about
security]{.mark}. Nuclear deterrence is a purposeful
strategy]{.underline}, reflecting the retaliatory destruction states
threaten when facing certain situations. [According to a standard
feminist understanding of IR, this is a ["stereotypically
masculine"]{.mark}]{.underline} (Wright 2010, 206) [perspective. By
viewing [ideas such as rationality, autonomy,]{.mark} and [power as
socially constructed masculine stereotypes]{.mark} rather than as
characteristics of human nature, feminist critics suggest that [IR
concepts]{.mark} that are long taken-for-granted, [**like deterrence,
are** actually **gendered.**]{.mark}]{.underline} Echoing these ideas
from Tickner's (1988) work discussed above, Cohn et al. (2005, 4)
explain how the use of **[[masculine language frames debates about
nuclear weapons]{.mark} and strategy:]{.underline}**

> Ideas about gender also shape, limit and distort the national and
> international political processes through which decisions about WMD
> \[weapons of mass destruction\] are made. [Ideas about strength,
> protection, rationality, security and control have a critical impact
> on governmental and intergovernmental policy, as well as functioning
> at a large-scale societal level, where a certain notion of aggressive
> masculinity is equated with human nature.]{.underline}

These concepts are apparent in the film, as IR scholars like Kuzma and
Haney (2001), Lindley (2001), and Valeriano (2013) emphasize. Strategist
Dr. Strangelove certainly describes and criticizes the Soviet doomsday
device in these terms: "Deterrence is the art of producing in the mind
of the enemy . . . the fear to attack. And so, because of the automated
and irrevocable decision-making process which rules out human meddling,
the doomsday machine is terrifying. It's simple to understand. And
completely credible, and convincing." A few moments later, Strangelove
notes that the "whole point of the doomsday machine is lost if you keep
it a secret!" He asks Ambassador de Sadeski, "Why didn't you tell the
world, eh?" For feminist critics, the practical and pedagogical value
that analysts and scholars have traditionally derived from discussing
and teaching Dr. Strangelove, which emphasize the alleged requirements
of nuclear deterrence, may well reinforce the gender stereotypes
embedded in the concepts.

Despite many decades of important feminist critiques of national
security policies, nuclear armaments, military life, war, and even the
definition of security itself, a large schism continues to divide most
IR academics and the field's feminist scholars (Cohn 2018). Whereas
Sjoberg (2010, 2) finds that [feminist theories have paved the way for
meaningful and even pragmatic changes in the policy world, and gender is
now a "salient concern of global governance," she emphasizes that
**feminists and mainstream security studies scholars rarely communicate.
The result is that national security curriculum, scholarship, and
practice remain reified as masculine spheres**]{.underline} (Zalewski
and Parpart 1998). Charli Carpenter (2007, 341) contends that a good
starting point for addressing this fissure is for scholars to provide
material that allows students learning about the discipline to recognize
the importance of masculinity in IR. Dr. Strangelove is precisely such a
text---and it is already widely used. However, IR and security scholars
would need to acknowledge and discuss sexual and gender-related themes
and images that have long been apparent to film critics and scholars
from other disciplines, even as they incorporate feminist criticisms
from the discipline.

Conclusions

The IR analysts and scholars who continue to discuss the classic film
Dr. Strangelove publicly, and/or utilize it in their classes, typically
reference or use the film to emphasize traditional points about
deterrence and national security. Indeed, as demonstrated, these experts
do not typically grapple with the film's gender themes or "sexual
subtext," though these ideas have long been highlighted by scholars from
other disciplines and film critics. IR experts recognize that Stanley
Kubrick's decision to employ satire allowed him to critique nuclear
deterrence and high-level decision-making, but they typically overlook
Dr. Strangelove's overt comparison of the logic of nuclear deterrence
strategy to absurd male sexual fantasies and exaggerated notions of
masculinity. While [Dr. Strangelove]{.underline} obviously depicts a
male-dominated world, the story does not follow established masculine
tropes of war narratives. It is neither a tragedy nor a heroic romance.
The film is not a straight-forward and serious story about autonomous
states and the men who lead them making rational calculations and
decisions about how to use military power. Those allegedly masculine
traits are referenced in the film, but many of the men are shown to be
irrational, and the autonomy and power of every man and nation is
ultimately challenged by the existence of a doomsday device that is
triggered automatically. [The film satirizes and thereby ridicules
top-level male national security elites by revealing them to be
buffoonish characters whose sexual fantasies and behaviors cannot
readily be separated from their outlandish ideas about nuclear weapons,
deterrence strategy, and war.]{.underline}

The field's failure to emphasize the sexual subtext of Dr. Strangelove
parallels more broadly the lack of scholarly engagement with feminist
contributions to IR and security studies. As both opinion and literature
surveys reveal, IR and security studies scholars do not normally discuss
feminist perspectives in their courses and generally overlook feminist
literature in their research. By acknowledging Dr. Strangelove's
numerous sexual metaphors and images and linking them to feminist
arguments about nuclear weapons and strategy, IR scholars and policy
experts could effectively grapple with the film's wargasm and start to
narrow divisions in the field. Because Dr. Strangelove is such an
important IR text, changing the way it is discussed and taught could
effectively provide a bridge to feminist scholarship about militarized
masculinity, nuclear weapons, and deterrence strategy. Artifacts of
popular culture increasingly influence the field of IR (Daniel and
Musgrave 2017). Scholars should take seriously the wider culture's
understanding of those artifacts--- especially when they so neatly align
with an important and critical subfield in the discipline (Grayson,
Davies, and Philpott 2009, 156).

Finally, as feminists like Cohn have demonstrated, real-world
contemporary depictions of nuclear weapons and strategy reveal an
ongoing need to identify and critique the sexual images and metaphors
still at work in public debates. [If a wider range of scholars
understood and embraced the feminist interpretation of Dr. Strangelove,
**[scholars could]{.mark} publicly [confront]{.mark} such
[depictions]{.mark} and [extend]{.mark} the [feminist critique]{.mark}
well beyond the academic IR classroom.**]{.underline} For example, Cohn
and Ruddick (2004, 422--23) reference an Indian newspaper's political
cartoon published after five 1998 nuclear tests. It featured the caption
"Made with Viagra." They likewise quote a Hindu nationalist leader
saying that the bomb helped "to prove that we are not eunuchs." Beyond
these examples related to nuclear proliferation, defense intellectuals,
military leaders, and prominent politicians continue to talk brazenly
about the links between sexual urges, macho competition, nuclear weapons
systems, and war. Tom Christie, "the Pentagon's chief weapons tester"
during the George W. Bush presidency (2001 to 2005), made sexually
tinged remarks about the latest F-35 stealth aircraft, which is expected
to be fitted with nuclear bombs by 2024: "[There's always this sexual
drive for a new airplane on the part of each \[armed\] service . . .
Persistent, urgent and natural"]{.underline} (quoted in Thompson 2013).
Identifying the same theme, retired General Lee Butler (quoted in Kazel
2015), who served in 1991 as the final commander of the US Strategic Air
Command, recently told an interviewer that nations amass nuclear weapons
for "testosterone-driven" reasons. Similarly, [General Stanley
McChrystal (quoted in Rose 2013, 8) provocatively declared, "If you look
at the role I had in Iraq, it is sexy, it is satisfying, it is manly, it
scratches an itch in the American culture that people
like."]{.underline} Notoriously, of course, the second Iraq war was
initially and primarily justified by the Bush administration because of
fears that Saddam Hussein would acquire nuclear weapons.

Most recently, [President Donald Trump prominently taunted North Korean
leader Kim Jong-un by calling him "little rocket man" and warning that
America would unleash "fire and fury" on North Korea should it make any
new threats against the United States.]{.underline} On January 2, 2018,
Trump tweeted (quoted in Ditum 2018) [that Kim Jong-un "stated that the
'Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.' Will someone . . . please
inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger &
more powerful one than his, and my Button works!"]{.underline} As Cohn
(2018) opined, [this "nuclear saber-rattling . . . sounded a lot like,
well, penismeasuring."]{.underline} Beatrice Fihn (Miles 2018),
executive director of the policy-oriented International Campaign to
Abolish Nuclear Weapons, criticized Trump for "threatening to mass
murder a whole country" and claimed [that Trump's "politics were imbued
with 'toxic masculinity.']{.underline}" Columnist Sarah Ditum used the
same "toxic masculinity" phrasing to describe Trump's threats but
pointed out that his reference to a nuclear button was "not the most
impressive penis euphemism ever." [These examples reveal that the
lessons about gender and nuclear weapons that can be learned from Dr.
Strangelove remain relevant today, and ongoing [**public debates**
provide ample opportunity for security analysts]{.mark} and IR scholars
[to take the feminist criticisms seriously.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--L\-\--Liberalism

#### The 1AC\'s liberal framing is masculinist at its core---its faith in rational self-interest excludes women and erases feminine values like care, nurture, and interdependence from Arctic climate policy.

[[Liberalism]{.underline}]{.mark}, the main competing theory of
international relations to realism, [[is not free from masculine]{.mark}
[values]{.mark} underpinning basic assumptions]{.underline}, according
to Tickner. While realists emphasize competition and power struggles,
liberals are advocates of free trade and cooperation between states that
will maximize benefits[. According [to liberals, human beings]{.mark}
[are driven by rational self interest]{.mark}]{.underline}. "The
rational economic man" is offered in contrast to "the political man".
But [perhaps [the difference is not]{.mark} so
[great]{.mark}]{.underline}? [[The rational]{.mark} economic
[man]{.mark} [has many similarities to the political ma]{.mark}n, but
**[his aggressive]{.mark} [passions]{.mark}** have been [**tamed** by
the]{.mark} rational **[pursuit of profit]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Tickner 1992). [[Women are still absent]{.mark} from the picture [and
feminine values]{.mark} related to caring, nurture and service, all of
which are crucial for reproduction and the survival of the younger
generation, [are nowhere to be found.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### **The Liberalist paradigm of international relations ignores the interior bounds of the public private sphere, empirically emboldening the masculine 'protector' while simultaneously objectifying the 'weak' feminine and bracketing them out of spaces of competition in the welfare state.**

Feminist critiques of liberalism have been addressed primarily to
liberalism in its broad sense. [Feminists see [problems in the dichotomy
between the private and the public]{.mark} which lies at the [**centre**
of liberal thought]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Because it [divides]{.mark}
the private [**domestic** life of women from]{.mark} the [public world
of men]{.mark}, they see this separation as inherently
gendered]{.underline}. [[Liberalism]{.mark} treats the [public and
private spheres as independent of one another]{.mark} when in reality
[they are inextricably connected]{.mark}, and so [obscures]{.mark} a
fundamental [source of inequality and oppression]{.mark} in relations
[between the sexes]{.mark}]{.underline}. Pateman (1989a) argues that the
liberal separation is actually two-fold, with the division between
public and private being concealed 4 within the larger one of state and
civil society. F[eminist critiques of the public/private split have
taken varying form, as a dichotomy between nature and culture, between
morality and power, and between the personal and the
political]{.underline}. Feminism's response to liberalism is complicated
by the fact that its own origins lie in the liberal tradition. Its claim
that woman is an independent being is premised on the eighteenthcentury
liberal conception of the independent and autonomous self. While
mainstream feminism arose as a recognisably liberal movement, its
socialist, radical, cultural variants have shared many liberal tenets
(Eisenstein, 1981: 4). All feminisms challenge the liberal separation of
public and private spheres of social life to some degree.

The individualism and universalism of liberal thought are both flawed on
this account. [[Liberal **individualism**]{.mark} acknowledges [only the
bounded self of the public sphere]{.mark}, and so [denies
recognition]{.mark} to the interdependencies and [social
**connectedness** of human society]{.mark} that are relatively more
[important]{.mark} in the [lives of women]{.mark} than of men (Graham,
1983; Hartsock, 1983: 252-9]{.underline}). Gilligan (1982) refers to
this as an 'ethic of care' in women's lives. [[Liberalism's claim to be
universalistic is false]{.mark} on the same account, for the [liberal
individual]{.mark} tacitly [refers only to the **male actor** of the
public sphere]{.mark}]{.underline}. J[ones (1990) takes this line of
argument further. She suggests that the [liberal citizen is modelled
on]{.mark} the behaviour of **[white male elites]{.mark}**, measuring
all citizens against a standard **defined** by particular race, gender
and class characteristics.]{.underline} She specifies three dimensions
in which the particulars of male identity are falsely universalised: the
body in both its symbolic and corporeal senses; the division of social
life into public and private domains in which the sphere of private life
is perceived as 'outside' both state and civil society; [and the
**recognition** of political behaviour only in the competitive,
individual terms of electoral activity, [**obscuring** women's relations
to the state as claimants and low-level service
workers]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[These [problems]{.mark} also [weaken liberalism's]{.mark} claims to be
[egalitarian and meliorist]{.mark}. How can it [treat individuals as
having equal worth without recognising the particularities of individual
and group identity]{.mark}]{.underline} (Vogel, 1988: 136; Yeatman,
1994)? How can social and political institutions be improved without
such recognition? As Jones puts it:

5 even if women achieve juridical/legal equality, gain more adequate
political representation in law-making and administrative bodies, and
possess the economic means and personal motivation to practice their
rights; [and even if women's duties to the state are **broadened** to
include military service, women's **membership** in the political
community still will be **less full** than men's.]{.underline} (Jones,
1990: 782)

Feminist critiques of liberalism have taken sharpest form in the
discussion of the welfare state. In 'The Patriarchal Welfare State',
Pateman maintains that, 'since the early twentieth century, welfare
policies have reached across from public to private and helped uphold a
patriarchal structure of familial life' (1989b: 183; see also Wilson,
1979). [Pateman argues that [welfare states have]{.mark} formed around
[ideals of citizenship based on **'independence'**]{.mark}, in which
independence is [defined by masculine attributes]{.mark} and abilities.
[Women's citizenship]{.mark} is [framed as womanly
**dependence**]{.mark} and [is]{.mark} accordingly
**[defective]{.mark}**.]{.underline} It is also riddled with paradoxes
and contradictions. [Pateman identifies [three elements of
independence]{.mark} through [which patriarchal structures]{.mark} are
**encoded** [in welfare state citizenship]{.mark}: the capacity to [bear
arms]{.mark}, the capacity to [own **property**]{.mark} including
[property in one's own labour]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} the capacity for
[self-government]{.mark}, including [as protector]{.mark} of the family
unit]{.underline}. Pateman sees women's claims to full citizenship as
fraught with 'Wollstonecraft's dilemma', in [which demands for
gender-neutral inclusion on equal terms with men seem to **conflict**
with wishes for recognition of gender-specific talents, needs and
concerns]{.underline}. Pateman sees the welfare state as oppressing
women, but at the same time also responsible for important improvements
in women's circumstances and democratic opportunities. Whatever its
flaws, the welfare state has given women a degree of choice in their
economic dependence on men, and opened the matter of their rights to
public politics.

Fraser (1987) similarly finds a [[gendered]{.mark} **[division]{.mark}**
between public and private at the heart of welfare state provision,
arguing that this division [underlies the distinction between social
insurance and social assistance programs]{.mark} typical [of]{.mark}
most [welfare states]{.mark}]{.underline}. Fraser suggests that [social
insurance [programs construct beneficiaries]{.mark} as rights [bearing
**possessive** individuals]{.mark} and hence [paradigmatically
**male**]{.mark}, while [social **assistance**]{.mark} arrangements
[frame]{.mark} theirs as [clients]{.mark} and [paradigmatically
**female**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Fraser 6 sees this as a double
distinction, in that the rights of social insurance recipients have a
contractual status while the entitlements of social assistance claimants
subject them to the guiding authority of welfare officers. In pointing
to the mediating role of administrative authority, she is less
optimistic about the democratic potential of the welfare state (Yeatman,
1990: 139-48). Fraser's argument leans heavily on the American example,
and the nature of both social insurance and social assistance varies a
good deal from one country to another (Eardley, 1996). It refers to one
of potentially various ways in which gender may be built into welfare
state structuring of public and private life.

Writing from the background of more highly developed welfare states,
Scandinavian feminists have seen the critiques of English-speaking
feminists as too negative about the role of social policy institutions
in the lives of women. Like Pateman, they have seen women's reliance on
the state as an improvement on circumstances in which they are dependent
on individual men (Hernes, 1988: 188; Siim, 1988: 182). In the same way,
they have seen women's active political participation as a potential
counter to the rendering of women as clients of welfare state authority.
Piven (1990) makes the same case with respect to the United States.

Hernes (1988: 202-09) in particular argues that Scandinavian social
policy arrangements bridge the liberal division between public and
private life. In these countries the mobilisation and political
incorporation of women in the second phase of welfare state development
has led to a 'public/private mix'. While these writers are not
uncritical of social policy in the countries of the region (Waerness,
1984; Leira, 1992), the comparative accounts suggest that Scandinavian
welfare states differ from others in this respect. In much of Catholic
Europe the tradition of subsidiarity secured the autonomy of the family
against intrusion by the state, often assigning a continuing welfare
role to church and voluntary bodies The German and Dutch welfare states
follow this pattern though the French is more ambiguous (Flora, 1986:
xviii; Esping-Andersen, 1990: 27; Borchorst, 1994: 32-5; Gustafsson,
1994: 53-6; Ostner, 1993: 103-6; Hantrais, 1993). Siim (1988: 176-9)
distinguishes between women's dependency on the welfare state as clients
and as consumers, and suggests that their dependency as clients
predominates in Britain and the USA while dependency as consumers is
more the norm in Denmark and Sweden. She regards the Danish welfare 7
state as having fostered a partnership between state and family, and to
some extent between women and the state, while the British welfare state
still largely leaves the support of reproductive life to the family.

### 2NC\-\--L\-\--Realism

#### The 1AC maps hegemonic masculinity onto state behavior, reflecting a patriarchal tradition in IR that privileges the glorified male warrior.

Tickner traces how [[in realism]{.mark}, the most dominant school of
thought within international relations, [the]{.mark} [idea]{.mark}l [of
the **glorified male warrior**]{.mark} has been [projected onto]{.mark}
the behavior of [states]{.mark}.]{.underline} Throughout history,
[[characteristics associated with masculinity]{.mark}, such as
[toughness, courage, power, independence]{.mark}, and even physical
strength, have been those most [valued in i]{.mark}nternational
[politics]{.mark}.]{.underline} This glorification of male warrior
attributes celebrates only one type of masculinity, however,
subordinating other types of masculinities. [Connell has used the term
"hegemonic masculinity" to explain how one type of [masculinity can
occupy the hegemonic position in a pattern of gender
relations]{.mark}.]{.underline} She defines [hegemonic masculinity as:
"... the configuration of gender practice which embodies the currently
accepted answer to the problem of the legitimacy of
patriarchy]{.underline}, which guarantees (or is taken to guarantee) the
dominant position of men and the subordination of women," (Connell 1995,
p. 77). [[Hegemonic masculinity is **sustained** through its
**opposition**]{.mark} to various [less valued masculinities]{.mark}
(e.g. homosexuality), [and]{.mark} through [its relations to]{.mark}
various devalued [feminine qualities]{.mark}, creating unequal power
relationships between different groups of men, and between men and
women]{.underline}. Tickner claims that in international politics, [the
[characteristics]{.mark} associated with hegemonic masculinity [are
projected]{.mark} [onto]{.mark} the behavior of [states whose success as

Tickner's book in particular presents an early feminist critique of the
realist tradition and the first step to evaluating prevalent notions of
security from a gender-sensitive perspective. With its military focus,
[IR security studies had become, according to Tickner, a "dysfunctional"
response to the challenges of human and environmental
security.]{.underline} As Tickner explains[, [realism
stresses]{.underline} ]{.mark}[rationality, strength, power, autonomy,
and independence, [qualities]{.mark} as [**associated** with foreign
policy and military affairs as they are with
**masculinity**]{.mark}]{.underline} (1992, 3). She problematizes as
well the exogeniety of domestic affairs in the realist account and shows
how ostensibly objective realist national security studies attempt to
explain the causes of war through a discourse that privileges a view
based on hegemonic masculinity. While realists take power as the
coercive means by which states obtain security at the expense of other
states, Tickner suggests instead that [an ethos of "mutual enablement
rather than domination" could underlie a positive-sum notion of security
inspired by peace activism]{.underline} (1992, 65). Like Elshtain,
Tickner challenges the [realist aversion to morality in IR, questioning
the adaptation of a set of public]{.underline} (and thus international)
[values as a basis for security so wildly at odds with the values we
"espouse at home"]{.underline} (1992, 138).

Applying gender as a category of analysis to show the possibility of a
more comprehensive notion of security, Tickner traces the linkage
between the system of international relations (and its theorization) and
multileveled, gendered insecurities. Against realism's assumption of
autonomous states and its prescription of self-help in a hostile
anarchical environment, Tickner argues that the threats of the nuclear
age, cross-border environmental degradation, and evidence of increasing
international cooperation demand that interdependence be taken seriously
(1992). [For Tickner, [the assumption that there is order within and
anarchy]{.mark} beyond the bounds of the community [effects a divide
between international and domestic politics]{.mark} that mirrors the
public-private split [that feminist theorists argue perpetuates domestic
violence.]{.mark}]{.underline} Tickner rejects the analytic separation
of explanations for war into distinct levels and the identification of
security with state borders, arguing that [violence at the
international, national, and family levels is interrelated, ironically
taking place in domestic and international spaces beyond the reaches of
law]{.underline} (1992, 58, 193). Feminists in IR find the
levels-of-analysis approach particularly inappropriate to their concerns
because [the [problem of the system of patriarchy cannot be addressed
**solely** by reference to particular **actors**, whether they are **men
or states**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Brown 1988, 473).

Recasting the state

Like Tickner, many IR feminists problematize the state and raise
questions as to its status as protector of women. Peterson argues that,
in addition to its relegation of sexual violence and its threat to the
private domestic realm, the state is implicated in the ways that [women
**become** "the objects of masculinist social control]{.mark} not only
through direct violence (murder, rape, battering, incest), [but also
[through ideological constructs, such as 'women's work]{.mark}' and the
[cult of motherhood, that justify structural
violence]{.mark}---[inadequate health care, sexual harassment, and
sex-segregated wages, rights and resources]{.mark}]{.underline}" (1992c,
46). However, while not denying the possibility of limited protection
offered by the state (Harrington 1992[), [FST contests the notion of
protection---"the exchange of obedience/subordination for (promises of)
security"---as a **justification** for state power]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Peterson 1992c, 50). Peterson likens the state's [provision of security
for women to a protection racket, "implicated in the reproduction of
hierarchies and in the structural violence against which they claim to
offer protection"]{.underline} (1992c, 51). In addition, Stiehm argues
that the state typically denies women the opportunity to be societal
"protectors," assigning to them the role of "protected" despite the
predatory threat often posed by their ostensible guardians (1983a).
[[Governmental attempts to achieve total security versus an external
threat can result in predictable oppression:]{.mark} "The problem is
that the [potential victim is both more accessible and compliant than
the marauder]{.mark}. Because the [protector is embarrassed and
frustrated by his failure to protect, he restricts his protectee
instead]{.mark}"]{.underline} (373). By circumscribing the possibilities
of the female deployment of legitimate force, [the masculine state
effectively denies the development of what Stiehm calls a "defender"
society, one "composed of citizens equally liable to experience violence
and equally responsible for exercising society's violence"]{.underline}
(367).

The sociology of the state has emphasized the [[connections between
**knowledge production** and the craft of the modern
state]{.underline}]{.mark} (Foucault 1978; Scott 1998). Feminist
knowledge has been mobilized to redesign state action, resulting in
critiques of collusion with the carceral state (Bernstein 2012; Kim
2020) and other conservative projects (Farris 2017). Thus, feminist
political struggles, successes, and failures against and within the
state have pushed [[feminists]{.underline}]{.mark} to put energy into
thinking about the state and gender dynamics (Halley et al. 2018; Haney
1996; Menon 2004; Morgan and Orloff 2017) while [[still being troubled
by the dilemma of gender justice.]{.underline}]{.mark}

In the case of activism against violence, this question is still very
present in feminist debates (Htun and Weldon 2017). First, [[there is
the **notorious gap** between law]{.mark} on the books [and]{.mark}
actual [state practices]{.mark}]{.underline} (Menjívar and Lakhani
2016), meaning that [the [adoption of]{.mark} specific [policies is not
translated]{.mark} [into real change on the ground]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Second, [the [**colonial nature** of]{.mark} the **modern
[state]{.mark}** [shows how]{.mark} historical [conditions shape
the]{.mark} contingent [relationship between]{.mark} [**gendered** and
**racialized relations**]{.mark}]{.underline} and state power, forging
state categories that include some groups and simultaneously exclude
others (Crenshaw 1991). These critiques support [[contemporary concerns
over]{.underline}]{.mark} the possible [[depoliticization of feminist
ideas and]{.underline}]{.mark} the decline of feminism as an
[[emancipatory]{.underline}]{.mark} collective
[[struggle]{.underline}]{.mark} (Eschle and Maiguashca 2014). Bearing
these critiques in mind, I [[approach the incorporation of feminist
frames]{.underline}]{.mark} on violence [[by the
state]{.underline}]{.mark} not merely as dynamics of co-optation or the
ending of powerful feminist projects, but [[as contextualized
processes]{.mark} that develop]{.underline} through time--space
[[with]{.underline}]{.mark} specific [[**repercussions** for feminist
communities.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Studies that focus on the institutionalization of social movement ideas
and frames also disclose how the local context and activists' strategies
shape dynamics of state incorporation. Nancy Whittier (2018), for
example, shows that throughout different legal reforms, [feminists
mobilized]{.underline} or de-emphasized controversial goals, [depending
on the concrete case]{.underline}. Feminists' strategies to mobilize
specific frames and discourses instead of others are linked to their
chances of influencing politics in a particular place and time,
considering "the arrangements of power" in society (Ferree 2003, 339).
However, activists can also frame against the odds. In Argentina,
feminists recently expanded the Ni Una a Menos movement frame on gender
violence to also encompass abortion rights, thereby raising a
significant issue that had long been politically untouchable (Daby and
Moseley 2022). Similarly, the same feminist frame might act as radical
by challenging power relations in the local context while being resonant
in the transnational sphere due to legal norms, as in the case of
feminicídio in Mexico (García-Del Moral 2016). Framing processes reveal
the articulation and diffusion of mobilizing ideas (Benford and Snow
2000) contingent on power relations that shape their outcomes (Ferree
2003). Feminist frames, therefore, are not stagnant but rather dynamic
meaning-making processes that interact with legal frameworks (Pedriana
2006) and movement opponents (McCammon 2012). Changes in the movement or
in the political context can provoke variations in framing processes,
leading to multiple possibilities in the development of a movement's
ideas (Benford and Snow 2000).

The state and hegemonic masculinity

Feminism as an academic discipline grew out of the feminist movement of
the 1960s and 1970s, but feminist perspectives first entered the
international relations discipline at the end of the 1980s, about the
same time as the end of the Cold War. A landmark book in feminist
writings in international relations is Ann Tickner´s book Gender in
International Relations published in 1992. Tickner points out that
because foreign and military [policy-making has largely been conducted
by men]{.underline}, it should not be surprising that the discipline
that analyses these activities is [primarily about men and
masculinity]{.underline}. "We seldom realize we think in these terms,"
she writes, "...however; in most fields of knowledge [we have become
accustomed to equating what is **human** with what is
**masculine**]{.underline}," (Tickner 1992, p. 5). Tickner traces how in
realism, the most dominant school of thought within international
relations, the ideal of the [[glorified **male warrior**]{.mark} has
been [projected onto the behavior of **states**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Throughout history, [[characteristics associated with
**masculinity**]{.mark}, such as toughness, courage, power,
independence, and even physical strength, [have been]{.mark} those [most
**valued** in **international politics**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
glorification of male warrior attributes celebrates only one type of
masculinity, however, subordinating other types of masculinities.
Connell has used the term ["hegemonic masculinity" to explain how one
type of masculinity can occupy the hegemonic position in a pattern of
gender relations]{.underline}. She defines hegemonic masculinity as:
["... the configuration of gender practice which embodies the currently
accepted answer to the problem of the legitimacy of patriarchy, which
guarantees (or is taken to guarantee) the dominant position of men and
the subordination of women,"]{.underline} (Connell 1995, p. 77).
Hegemonic masculinity is sustained through its opposition to various
less valued masculinities (e.g. homosexuality), and through its
relations to various devalued feminine qualities, creating unequal power
relationships between different groups of men, and between men and
women. Tickner claims that in international politics, the
characteristics associated with [**[hegemonic masculinity]{.mark}** are
[projected onto]{.mark} the [behavior of states]{.mark} whose
**[success]{.mark}** as international actors is [**measured** in terms
of]{.mark} their **[power]{.mark}** capabilities [and]{.mark} capacity
for **self-help** and **[autonomy]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Tickner 1992).
Liberalism, the main competing theory of international relations to
realism, is not free from masculine values underpinning basic
assumptions, according to Tickner. While realists emphasize competition
and power struggles, liberals are advocates of free trade and
cooperation between states that will maximize benefits. According to
liberals, human beings are driven by rational self interest. "The
rational economic man" is offered in contrast to "the political man".
But perhaps the difference is not so great? The rational economic man
has many similarities to the political man, but his aggressive passions
have been tamed by the rational pursuit of profit (Tickner 1992). Women
are still absent from the picture and feminine values related to caring,
nurture and service, all of which are crucial for reproduction and the
survival of the younger generation, are nowhere to be found. After
drawing up the picture of international politics as a masculine domain,
Tickner asks: "How could feminist perspectives contribute anything new
to its academic discourses?" (1992, p. 17). She argues that by
privileging masculine values over feminine, the options available to
states and their policy-makers to tackle the global challenges of the
present are seriously constrained. Since [[knowledge about the behavior
of states]{.underline}]{.mark} and the international systems
[[depends]{.underline}]{.mark} almost entirely [[on
assumptions]{.underline}]{.mark} that are [[derived from men]{.mark}´s
experiences]{.underline}, a large part of human experience is ignored,
[[limiting our ability to come up with]{.mark} innovative and
transformative [solutions]{.mark}]{.underline} to problems.

Competition or cooperation?

To evaluate if climate change is a security threat in the Arctic, one
must be clear on what is meant by security. Are the main concerns with
potential conflicts between states or should we be more concerned with
human security challenges at the local level? The focus of attention is
important, because it not only influences how policy is shaped but it
directs what types of policy measures are implemented. Already, it has
been established by scientific research that the Arctic is extremely
vulnerable to observed and projected climate change and climate changes
are being experienced particularly intensely in the region. For example,
in the past few decades, Arctic average temperature has risen at almost
twice the rate of the rest of the world (Arctic Council 2004). The
warming of the Arctic is causing thawing of the permafrost soils of the
tundra, melting of glaciers and increasing erosion of the coasts by wave
action and storms. These changes are impacting the natural environment,
but the effects on human communities are also considerable. These
[effects can be viewed both as threats and opportunities]{.underline}.
For example, the melting of ice can make extraction of resources easier
and new shipping routes more viable. These new opportunities could,
however, turn out to be potential sources of conflict, and thus pose a
threat to security in the region (German Advisory Council 2008). In an
article published in Foreign Affairs, Borgerson (2008) argues that
[global climate change has given birth to a new scramble for territory
and resources among Arctic powers]{.underline}. He warns that while
other Arctic powers (Russia, Norway, Denmark and Canada) are in a race
to claim additional territory in the region, the US is remaining on the
sidelines. Borgerson is concerned that without US leadership to help
develop diplomatic solutions to competing claims and potential
conflicts, the region could erupt in an armed conflict, asstates compete
for newly accessible resources. "Although the melting Arctic holds great
promise, it also poses grave dangers. The combination of new shipping
routes, trillions of dollars in possible oil and gas resources, and a
poorly defined picture of state ownership makes for a toxic brew," he
says (Borgerson 2008, p. 73). Borgerson is approaching the topic from
the traditional [realist perspective]{.underline}, claiming that climate
change is creating [new **threats** to US **national
security**]{.underline}, [due to the competing territorial claims of
Arctic states]{.underline} in order to gain access to and control over
new shipping routes, energy resources, fishing grounds and other
potential assets. [[Although he calls upon the US gov]{.mark}ernment
[to]{.mark} provide leadership in [negotiat]{.mark}ing [diplomatic
solutions]{.mark}]{.underline}, rather than using their military power,
[he [clearly expects]{.mark} that if left alone, the other [states will
use the threat of military force to sort out]{.mark} their [competing
claims.]{.mark} The fear that the melting of the Arctic ice will lead to
a competitive "scramble for resources"]{.underline} has been echoed in
numerous media accounts in recent years. However, other authors and
commentators point out that cooperation is a more logical path to
follow. For example, in a paper on the new security agenda in the High
North, Bailes (2009) emphasizes the importance of cooperation of both
states and nonstate actors,: "Even at this early stage in exploring the
new northern agenda, it is crystal clear that the only viable solutions
are based on win-win cooperation and on respect for planned,
transparent, at least partly regulated frameworks of action by state and
non-state actors alike," (Bailes 2009, p. 3). Whether competition or
cooperation is the guiding light in present day interaction among Arctic
states is not always obvious. The rhetoric is clearly one of
cooperation. For the past two decades interregional cooperation has
increased and numerous regional initiatives and forums have been
created. The Arctic Council, for example, was established in 1996 as a
high level intergovernmental forum to provide means for promoting
cooperation, coordination and interaction among the Arctic States,
especially in the fields of sustainable development and environmental
protection (Arctic Council n.d.). Heininen (2010b) argues that at the
beginning of the 21st century the Arctic is a stable and peaceful region
with increased cooperation both within the region and between the region
and the outside world. However, he also warns that this spirit of
cooperation will not automatically continue when new challenges arise.
For example, even though climate change is an environmental issue, [it
also has a security dimension related to state sovereignty and the
national security of Arctic states]{.underline}. Thus, the [issue may
appear as a traditional security issue]{.underline}, calling for
[remilitarization of the region]{.underline}, but this would be a
mistake, since climate change needs a more comprehensive approach to
security, one that includes issues related to both environmental
security and human security (Heininen 2010b). Feminist scholars have
also highlighted this risk. For example, MacGregor warns that the
securitization of climate change can lead to a "masculinization" of
environmentalism. If climate change is securitized it is constructed as
a problem that requires the kinds of solutions that are the traditional
domain of men and hegemonic masculinity. This could mean that [both
**[military responses]{.mark}** and **[exceptional measures]{.mark}**
that depend on [**downgrading of ethical concerns** would be
**justified**]{.mark}]{.underline} (MacGregor 2010). Challenging the
traditional, state-centric view of security thus seems to be an
important component of any attempts to securitize climate change in an
effort to channel more resources into political processes. Rather than
focusing on states, the more [[people-oriented approach]{.mark} of human
security seems to be a [more appropriate framework for analyzing
threats]{.mark} posed by climate change.]{.underline} The [human
security approach is particularly appealing for feminist
researchers]{.underline}, who have generally [sought to emphasize
marginal groups and give voice to the powerless]{.underline}, using
gender as an analytical tool. In fact, one can easily draw a [parallel
between the human security agenda and feminist security theory since the
works of feminist scholars]{.underline} on war; gender and security
[have contributed to the emergence of human security. **Feminist
scholars**]{.underline} writing about security have [focused on the
[security of the **individual**, rather than the
**state**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and among other things they have
contributed to the understanding of how [**[structural
violence]{.mark}** can [**threaten** the **security** of
**individuals**]{.mark} and groups]{.underline}. The concept
["structural violence", as a term to describe **social
injustice**]{.underline}, was first introduced by peace researcher Johan
Galtung, in his article Violence, Peace and Peace Research. He uses the
concept to explain how [systems created by society can
discriminate]{.underline} (often unintentionally) [against individuals
belonging to certain groups]{.underline} (Galtung 1969). Feminists have
developed [this concept to explain the [exploitation of women]{.mark}
under the patriarchal system]{.underline}, and pointed at the various
[[**dangers** posed to **certain groups**]{.mark} in society, [**even
if** national security is **not threatened**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Although feminist scholars have been very critical of the traditional
definition of security, their criticism did not reach mainstream
discourse in security studies. The emergence of the human security
agenda, however, changed this. Although the human security concept can
be traced to policy institutions like the UNDP, or individual
governments like Canada and Norway, Thórarinsdóttir (2009) points at
three ways in which feminism influenced the human security agenda.
First, the writings of feminist scholars on security issues helped to
create fertile soil for the new concept. Second, women activist
organizations had prepared the ground, by drawing attention to gender
based violence in conflicts, and third, it can be argued that the
increasing number of women in position of power, both in national
governments and within international institutions, helped pave the way
for new ideas to emerge and gain acceptance. The broadening of the
security concept, and the increasing emphasis on human security, both
globally and in the Arctic context, point towards a shift, where
feminine values are given greater weight than before in security
discourses. The emergence of new challenges, like climate change, has no
doubt facilitated this shift. Yet, the more [traditional views of
security]{.underline} are still noticeable and might be more [evident in
state actions]{.underline} than rhetoric. For example, despite a
decreased military presence in the Arctic since the Cold War, there is
not any real evidence of disarmament in northern regions. While in some
parts of the Arctic military bases and radar stations have been closed
and troops have been withdrawn and activities stopped, in other parts
military activities have been extended and new areas have been
identified as strategically important (Heininen 2010a). Thus, it is
clear that a certain [tension exists between the need to cooperate and
the tendency to prioritize the protection of one's own
interests]{.underline}. When it comes to utilization of resources that
the melting of the Arctic ice will make more accessible, however, there
seems to be little disagreement about the prediction that states in the
region will be eager to exploit those resources. This is especially true
of the oil and gas reserves, in spite of the fact that the utilization
of those resources will further add to worldwide greenhouse gas
emission, intensifying the ecological and human security problems
created by climate change. When it comes to man´s right to exploit
nature, dominant values seem to be unchallenged. This brings us to the
feminist views of the relationship between humans and nature. Humans and
nature: domination or partnership? Climate change is an issue that does
not fit well with the power-seeking behavior of states described in
realist theories, since it is a phenomenon that has no respect for
national boundaries and calls for collective action. From the time of
the formation of the modern state in the 17th century Europe, natural
resources and geographical spaces have been viewed as resources for
increasing state power and wealth. Further strengthening this view was
the scientific revolution that also began in the 17th century; it
provided a more mechanistic view of nature than had been the previous
norm. Prior to this revolution, humans were considered to form an
integral part of nature, but during this period nature began to be
viewed as a machine to be exploited for human benefit (Tickner 1992).
Ecofeminism has made important contributions towards understanding the
relationship between humans and nature, pointing at the parallel between
the patriarchal system, where the masculine dominates the feminine, with
the domination of humans over nature. As MacGregor (2010) points out,
however, ecofeminism has been suffering from a negative reputation as
being spiritualist and essentialist and naturalizing of women´s
reproductive and domestic roles, and thus has received harsh criticism
from many feminist scholars. Yet, some more recent ecofeminist scholars
have rejected this essentialist connection between women and nature,
stressing instead that the oppression of women and the domination of
nature are both the result of patriarchy. "What all ecofeminists agree
about is that there are important connections between the domination of
women and the domination of nature," writes Warren (1998, p. 264). Part
of the problem is dualism in Western thought, whereby disjunctive pairs
are seen as opposite (rather than complementary) and exclusive (rather
than inclusive), and higher value (status, prestige) is attributed to
that which is higher than to that which is lower. Examples of this would
be twin concepts like: reason/emotion, mind/ body, culture/nature,
human/nature, and man/woman. [[Whatever is historically associated
with]{.mark} emotion, body, nature and [women]{.mark} is [regarded as
**inferior** to that which is associated with]{.mark} reason, mind,
culture, human (i.e. male), and [men]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
[[value-loaded dualism]{.mark} becomes a [part of a larger conceptual
framework]{.mark}, where **[socially constructed]{.mark}** sets of basic
beliefs, values, attitudes and [assumptions shape]{.mark} how one
[views]{.mark} oneself and others. A conceptual [framework is
**oppressive** when it]{.mark} **explains**, [**justifies**, and
**maintains**]{.mark} relationships of [**domination** and
**subordination**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Warren 1998). For ecofeminists,
[the [solution]{.mark} to these problems [includes]{.mark} [dismantling
the man made rift]{.mark} created between humans and
nature]{.underline}. For example, Ruether writes: "We need to think of
human consciousness not as separating us as a higher species from the
rest of nature, but rather as a gift to enable us to learn how to
harmonize our needs with the natural system around us, of which we are
dependent part," (Ruether 1993).

In the past, the [Arctic has often been presented as a pristine
territory]{.underline}, waiting to be discovered. Arctic explorers´
travelogues created an [image of a cold, dangerous, distant but
mysterious region. Only the brave and heroic dared to
travel]{.underline} to there. [Whereas the [image of the explorer
is]{.mark} of [the **masculine hero**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [the
Arctic]{.underline} ]{.mark}[as a region [is
**feminized**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [[Arctic environment]{.mark} is
[pristine, untouched]{.mark}, and [almost **virgin** like]{.mark}. It is
[to be **conquered**]{.mark} by the brave explorer. [Masculine values
are]{.mark} also [dominant]{.mark}]{.underline} in more [recent
times]{.underline}[, [when the Arctic became a playing field for
superpowers to demonstrate]{.underline}]{.mark} [their [military
power]{.mark}]{.underline}. Heininen (2010a) identifies three different
stages of security in the Arctic in past decades. The first stage
started during World War II when the Arctic was militarized. During this
period open battle took place, e.g. bombings of the harbor of Kirkenes
in Norway, and the harbor and town of Murmansk in the Soviet Union. The
struggle between states about sovereignty had reached these northern
regions and military tension was high. The second stage of security
covers most of the Cold War and Heininen names this stage "military
theatre". During this period, political and military competition between
the two superpowers, the USA and the Soviet Union, was a dominant factor
and the arms race was at its heights. By the end of the Cold War, the
Arctic was heavily militarized, the region was one of the most important
platforms for nuclear weapons systems and there was a strong sense of
the enemy state being a threat to national security on both sides of the
conflict. The third stage is the transition stage, indicating the shift
towards demilitarization of the region after the Cold War. The
transition was inspired by the 1987 Murmansk speech of Mikhail
Gorbachev, then the president of the Soviet Union, and included not only
demilitarization but also an increase in civil cooperation in several
fields such as economics, environmental protection and science (Heininen
2010a). While masculine values of competition and control over territory
can easily be linked to the two first stages of security, the transition
phase brings in some new elements, indicating a possible shift in
values. Heininen and Southcott (2010) recognize this shift, pointing out
that a new vision has emerged, where the Arctic is increasingly being
viewed as homeland for indigenous peoples and as a platform for
international and interregional cooperation. This emerging vision is not
only challenging the vision of the Arctic as a military playing field,
but also the more traditional view of the region as primarily frozen,
extreme, and exotic; or as a sparsely populated frontier; or as an area
rich in natural resources, waiting to be exploited for the benefit of
the nation. But how does climate change and the melting of the Arctic
ice influence this picture? Will the environmental changes threaten the
peace and stability of the region, leading to a race for resources and
competition between and among states? Or will climate change provide
added incentives for cooperation among states and other stakeholders,
changing the third security stage identified by Heininen from a
transition stage to a more long term transformation stage? The answers
are not clear. Currently there are two competing discourses on climate
change and security in the Arctic. One draws from the realist
perspective in international relations, in which power politics between
states dominate, the other can be linked to liberalism, emphasizing the
mutual benefit of cooperation. However, certain aspects of the second
discourse could also be identified with alternative approaches, calling
for a more radical transformation of values and the relationship between
states and citizens and between humans and nature. One purpose of this
paper is to explore whether feminist approaches can be identified in
this second discourse. Are feminine values still pushed to the margins
in the field of geopolitics or have they entered the stage as an
accepted player, capable of useful contribution to the shaping and
implementation of policy? Before digging deeper into the two competing
discourses, some background information is needed, to explain the links
between feminism and key theoretical approaches within international
relations.

The state and hegemonic masculinity

Feminism as an academic discipline grew out of the feminist movement of
the 1960s and 1970s, but feminist perspectives first entered the
international relations discipline at the end of the 1980s, about the
same time as the end of the Cold War. A landmark book in feminist
writings in international relations is Ann Tickner´s book Gender in
International Relations published in 1992. Tickner points out that
because foreign and military [policy-making has largely been conducted
by men]{.underline}, it should not be surprising that the discipline
that analyses these activities is [primarily about men and
masculinity]{.underline}. "We seldom realize we think in these terms,"
she writes, "...however; in most fields of knowledge [we have become
accustomed to equating what is **human** with what is
**masculine**]{.underline}," (Tickner 1992, p. 5). Tickner traces how in
realism, the most dominant school of thought within international
relations, the ideal of the [[glorified **male warrior**]{.mark} has
been [projected onto the behavior of **states**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Throughout history, [[characteristics associated with
**masculinity**]{.mark}, such as toughness, courage, power,
independence, and even physical strength, [have been]{.mark} those [most
**valued** in **international politics**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
glorification of male warrior attributes celebrates only one type of
masculinity, however, subordinating other types of masculinities.
Connell has used the term ["hegemonic masculinity" to explain how one
type of masculinity can occupy the hegemonic position in a pattern of
gender relations]{.underline}. She defines hegemonic masculinity as:
["... the configuration of gender practice which embodies the currently
accepted answer to the problem of the legitimacy of patriarchy, which
guarantees (or is taken to guarantee) the dominant position of men and
the subordination of women,"]{.underline} (Connell 1995, p. 77).
Hegemonic masculinity is sustained through its opposition to various
less valued masculinities (e.g. homosexuality), and through its
relations to various devalued feminine qualities, creating unequal power
relationships between different groups of men, and between men and
women. Tickner claims that in international politics, the
[[characteristics associated with **hegemonic masculinity**]{.mark} are
[projected onto the behavior of states]{.mark} whose
**[success]{.mark}** as international actors is [**measured** in terms
of]{.mark} their **[power]{.mark}** capabilities and capacity for
**self-help** [and **autonomy**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Tickner 1992).
Liberalism, the main competing theory of international relations to
realism, is not free from masculine values underpinning basic
assumptions, according to Tickner. While realists emphasize competition
and power struggles, liberals are advocates of free trade and
cooperation between states that will maximize benefits. According to
liberals, human beings are driven by rational self interest. "The
rational economic man" is offered in contrast to "the political man".
But perhaps the difference is not so great? The rational economic man
has many similarities to the political man, but his aggressive passions
have been tamed by the rational pursuit of profit (Tickner 1992). Women
are still absent from the picture and feminine values related to caring,
nurture and service, all of which are crucial for reproduction and the
survival of the younger generation, are nowhere to be found. After
drawing up the picture of international politics as a masculine domain,
Tickner asks: "How could feminist perspectives contribute anything new
to its academic discourses?" (1992, p. 17). She argues that by
privileging masculine values over feminine, the options available to
states and their policy-makers to tackle the global challenges of the
present are seriously constrained. Since [[knowledge about the behavior
of states]{.underline}]{.mark} and the international systems
[[depends]{.underline}]{.mark} almost entirely [[on
assumptions]{.underline}]{.mark} that are [[derived from men]{.mark}´s
experiences]{.underline}, a large part of human experience is ignored,
[[limiting our ability to come up with]{.mark} innovative and
transformative [solutions]{.mark}]{.underline} to problems.

Competition or cooperation?

To evaluate if climate change is a security threat in the Arctic, one
must be clear on what is meant by security. Are the main concerns with
potential conflicts between states or should we be more concerned with
human security challenges at the local level? The focus of attention is
important, because it not only influences how policy is shaped but it
directs what types of policy measures are implemented. Already, it has
been established by scientific research that the Arctic is extremely
vulnerable to observed and projected climate change and climate changes
are being experienced particularly intensely in the region. For example,
in the past few decades, Arctic average temperature has risen at almost
twice the rate of the rest of the world (Arctic Council 2004). The
warming of the Arctic is causing thawing of the permafrost soils of the
tundra, melting of glaciers and increasing erosion of the coasts by wave
action and storms. These changes are impacting the natural environment,
but the effects on human communities are also considerable. These
[effects can be viewed both as threats and opportunities]{.underline}.
For example, the melting of ice can make extraction of resources easier
and new shipping routes more viable. These new opportunities could,
however, turn out to be potential sources of conflict, and thus pose a
threat to security in the region (German Advisory Council 2008). In an
article published in Foreign Affairs, Borgerson (2008) argues that
global climate change has given birth to a new scramble for territory
and resources among Arctic powers. He warns that while other Arctic
powers (Russia, Norway, Denmark and Canada) are in a race to claim
additional territory in the region, the US is remaining on the
sidelines. Borgerson is concerned that without US leadership to help
develop diplomatic solutions to competing claims and potential
conflicts, the region could erupt in an armed conflict, asstates compete
for newly accessible resources. "Although the melting Arctic holds great
promise, it also poses grave dangers. The combination of new shipping
routes, trillions of dollars in possible oil and gas resources, and a
poorly defined picture of state ownership makes for a toxic brew," he
says (Borgerson 2008, p. 73). Borgerson is approaching the topic from
the traditional [[realist perspective, claiming that climate change is
creating new threats to US national security]{.underline},]{.mark} [[due
to]{.mark} the [competing territorial claims]{.mark} of Arctic
states]{.underline} in order to gain access to and control over new
shipping routes, energy resources, fishing grounds and other potential
assets. Although he calls upon the US government to provide leadership
in negotiating diplomatic solutions, rather than using their military
power, he clearly expects that if left alone, the other states will use
the threat of military force to sort out their competing claims. The
fear that the melting of the Arctic ice will lead to a competitive
"scramble for resources" has been echoed in numerous media accounts in
recent years. However, other authors and commentators point out that
cooperation is a more logical path to follow. For example, in a paper on
the new security agenda in the High North, Bailes (2009) emphasizes the
importance of cooperation of both states and nonstate actors,: "Even at
this early stage in exploring the new northern agenda, it is crystal
clear that the only viable solutions are based on win-win cooperation
and on respect for planned, transparent, at least partly regulated
frameworks of action by state and non-state actors alike," (Bailes 2009,
p. 3). Whether competition or cooperation is the guiding light in
present day interaction among Arctic states is not always obvious. The
rhetoric is clearly one of cooperation. For the past two decades
interregional cooperation has increased and numerous regional
initiatives and forums have been created. The Arctic Council, for
example, was established in 1996 as a high level intergovernmental forum
to provide means for promoting cooperation, coordination and interaction
among the Arctic States, especially in the fields of sustainable
development and environmental protection (Arctic Council n.d.). Heininen
(2010b) argues that at the beginning of the 21st century the Arctic is a
stable and peaceful region with increased cooperation both within the
region and between the region and the outside world. However, he also
warns that this spirit of cooperation will not automatically continue
when new challenges arise. For example, [even though [climate
change]{.mark} is an environmental issue, it also [has]{.mark} a
[security dimension related to state sovereignty]{.mark} and the
national security of Arctic states]{.underline}. Thus, the [issue may
appear as a traditional security issue]{.underline}, calling for
[remilitarization of the region]{.underline}, but [this would be a
mistake, since climate change [needs]{.mark} a more [comprehensive
approach]{.mark} to security]{.underline}, one that [[includes]{.mark}
issues related to both [environmental security and human]{.mark}
security]{.underline} (Heininen 2010b). Feminist scholars have also
highlighted this risk. For example, MacGregor warns that the
securitization of climate change can lead to a "masculinization" of
environmentalism. If climate change is securitized it is constructed as
a problem that requires the kinds of solutions that are the traditional
domain of men and hegemonic masculinity. This could mean that both
military responses and exceptional measures that depend on downgrading
of ethical concerns would be justified (MacGregor 2010). Challenging the
traditional, state-centric view of security thus seems to be an
important component of any attempts to securitize climate change in an
effort to channel more resources into political processes. Rather than
focusing on states, the more people-oriented approach of human security
seems to be a more appropriate framework for analyzing threats posed by
climate change. The human security approach is particularly appealing
for feminist researchers, who have generally sought to emphasize
marginal groups and give voice to the powerless, using gender as an
analytical tool. In fact, one can easily draw a parallel between the
human security agenda and feminist security theory since the works of
feminist scholars on war; gender and security have contributed to the
emergence of human security. Feminist scholars writing about security
have focused on the security of the individual, rather than the state,
and among other things they have contributed to the understanding of how
structural violence can threaten the security of individuals and groups.
The concept "structural violence", as a term to describe social
injustice, was first introduced by peace researcher Johan Galtung, in
his article Violence, Peace and Peace Research. He uses the concept to
explain how systems created by society can discriminate (often
unintentionally) against individuals belonging to certain groups
(Galtung 1969). Feminists have developed this concept to explain the
exploitation of women under the patriarchal system, and pointed at the
various dangers posed to certain groups in society, even if national
security is not threatened. Although feminist scholars have been very
critical of the traditional definition of security, their criticism did
not reach mainstream discourse in security studies. The emergence of the
human security agenda, however, changed this. Although the human
security concept can be traced to policy institutions like the UNDP, or
individual governments like Canada and Norway, Thórarinsdóttir (2009)
points at three ways in which feminism influenced the human security
agenda. First, the writings of feminist scholars on security issues
helped to create fertile soil for the new concept. Second, women
activist organizations had prepared the ground, by drawing attention to
gender based violence in conflicts, and third, it can be argued that the
increasing number of women in position of power, both in national
governments and within international institutions, helped pave the way
for new ideas to emerge and gain acceptance. The broadening of the
security concept, and the increasing emphasis on human security, both
globally and in the Arctic context, point towards a shift, where
feminine values are given greater weight than before in security
discourses. The emergence of new challenges, like climate change, has no
doubt facilitated this shift. Yet, the more [traditional views of
security]{.underline} are still noticeable and might be more [evident in
state actions]{.underline} than rhetoric. For example, despite a
decreased military presence in the Arctic since the Cold War, there is
not any real evidence of disarmament in northern regions. While in some
parts of the Arctic military bases and radar stations have been closed
and troops have been withdrawn and activities stopped, in other parts
military activities have been extended and new areas have been
identified as strategically important (Heininen 2010a). Thus, it is
clear that a certain [tension exists between the need to cooperate and
the tendency to prioritize the protection of one's own
interests]{.underline}. When it comes to utilization of resources that
the melting of the Arctic ice will make more accessible, [however, there
seems to be **little disagreement**]{.underline} about the prediction
that [states in the region will be eager to **exploit** those
resources.]{.underline} This is especially true of the oil and gas
reserves, in spite of the fact that the utilization of those resources
will further add to worldwide greenhouse gas emission, intensifying the
ecological and human security problems created by climate change. [When
it comes to **man´s right to exploit nature,** dominant values seem to
be **unchallenged**.]{.underline} This brings us to the feminist views
of the relationship between humans and nature. Humans and nature:
domination or partnership? **[Climate change]{.underline}** is an issue
that [does not fit well with the power-seeking behavior of states
described in realist theories, since it is a phenomenon that has no
respect for national boundaries and **calls for collective
action.**]{.underline} From the time of the formation of the modern
state in the 17th century Europe, natural resources and geographical
spaces have been viewed as resources for increasing state power and
wealth. Further strengthening this view was the scientific revolution
that also began in the 17th century; it provided a more mechanistic view
of nature than had been the previous norm. Prior to this revolution,
humans were considered to form an integral part of nature, but during
this period nature began to be viewed as a machine to be exploited for
human benefit (Tickner 1992). Ecofeminism has made important
contributions towards understanding the relationship between humans and
nature, pointing at the [[**parallel** between the **patriarchal**
system]{.mark}, where the **masculine dominates** the **feminine**,
[with]{.mark} the [**domination of humans** over
nature]{.mark}.]{.underline} As MacGregor (2010) points out, however,
ecofeminism has been suffering from a negative reputation as being
spiritualist and essentialist and naturalizing of women´s reproductive
and domestic roles, and thus has received harsh criticism from many
feminist scholars. Yet, some more [recent ecofeminist scholars have
[reject]{.mark}ed this [essentialist connection]{.mark}]{.underline}
between women and nature, stressing instead that the
[[oppression]{.mark} of women [and]{.mark} the [domination]{.mark} of
nature are [both the **result** of **patriarchy**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
"What all ecofeminists agree about is that there are important
[connections between the domination of women and the domination of
nature]{.underline}," writes Warren (1998, p. 264). Part of the problem
is dualism in Western thought, whereby disjunctive pairs are seen as
opposite (rather than complementary) and exclusive (rather than
inclusive), and higher value (status, prestige) is attributed to that
which is higher than to that which is lower. Examples of this would be
twin concepts like: reason/emotion, mind/ body, culture/nature,
human/nature, and man/woman. [[Whatever is historically associated
with]{.mark} emotion, body, nature and [women]{.mark} is [regarded as
**inferior** to that which is associated with]{.mark} reason, mind,
culture, human (i.e. male), and [men]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
[[value-loaded dualism]{.mark} becomes a [part of a larger conceptual
framework]{.mark}, where **[socially constructed]{.mark}** sets of basic
beliefs, values, attitudes and [assumptions shape]{.mark} how one
[views]{.mark} oneself and others. A conceptual [framework is
**oppressive** when it]{.mark} **explains**, [**justifies**, and
**maintains**]{.mark} relationships of [**domination** and
**subordination**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Warren 1998). For ecofeminists,
[the [solution]{.mark} to these problems [includes]{.mark} [dismantling
the man made rift]{.mark} created between humans and
nature]{.underline}. For example, Ruether writes: "We need to think of
human consciousness not as separating us as a higher species from the
rest of nature, but rather as a gift to enable us to learn how to
harmonize our needs with the natural system around us, of which we are
dependent part," (Ruether 1993).

In their 2007 report, National Security and the Threat of Climate
Change, a group of prominent retired U.S. military advisors described
**[[climate change as a "threat multiplier]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
facing many countries in the world, especially the [United
States]{.underline}. They cataloged [[dangers to national
security]{.underline}]{.mark} from [[climate change-related flooding,
drought, extreme weather, disease, famine, and]{.mark} environmentally
forced [migration]{.mark}]{.underline}. The report's [[focus on dangers
and conflicts reflected]{.underline}]{.mark} the institutional
perspective and interests of its all-male military advisory board. They
recommended strategic planning to defend against the threat of climate
change. They did not call for action on the causes of climate change
such as the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The
[**[militarization of climate change]{.mark}**, by [defining it]{.mark}
primarily [as a **security threat**]{.mark}]{.underline}, represents one
of several ways in which climate change policy [[is
**gendered**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The international [[failure to respond]{.underline}]{.mark} effectively
[[to climate change]{.underline}]{.mark} also can be understood by
analyzing the gender dimensions of the institutions that dominate
international climate change research, planning, and negotiations. In
her 2010 Nature article, "Call in the Women," feminist geographer Susan
Buckingham argued that [[**gender imbalance** is a major reason
for]{.mark} the ongoing [stalemate in]{.mark} international [efforts to
curb g]{.mark}reen[h]{.mark}ouse [g]{.mark}as
emission[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. Starting in 1995, international
environmental leaders have gathered each year at United Nations
Conference of Parties (COP) meetings around the world to settle on a
response to escalating changes in the global climate. In the past twenty
years of annual COP meetings, these **[mainly [male
negotiators]{.mark}]{.underline}** have [[not managed to produce]{.mark}
any [significant]{.mark} binding [agreements to reduce]{.mark} the rate
and scale of [climate change]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Negotiators' inability to craft an international climate change
agreement has persisted in the face of mounting scientific evidence and
wide consensus about the dangerous consequences of climate change to the
planet's biosphere and human societies. Critics of negotiators'
ineffectiveness typically fault the economic interests of carbon
emitting countries in maintaining a global energy and economic system
that benefits them. They [[seldom attribute]{.mark} COP meeting
[failures to]{.mark} the enduring power of **[gender
privilege]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Buckingham, however, sees a more
gendered COP landscape marked by the gendered culture and approach of
male negotiators. To bolster this critique, she reports [consistent
[research findings supporting **improved decision making**
in]{.mark}]{.underline} economic and political [[settings where **women
are included**]{.underline}]{.mark} in adequate numbers. Not
surprisingly, [this [research is ignored by]{.mark} predominately [male
representatives]{.mark}]{.underline} who dominate the ranks of COP
representatives (women comprise less than thirty percent of COP
delegates). This is despite the fact that in 1995 the United Nations
called for including women in all levels of environmental decision
making. Buckingham's conclusion: "there is [[enough
evidence]{.underline}]{.mark} now [[to justify **increasing women's
involvement**]{.mark} in decision-making on climate]{.underline} change.
We should do so without delay."

gendered features of the international system responsible for
influencing climate change policy. As we saw above, [[the military
is]{.mark} another [gendered]{.mark} institution intimately related to
national governments and economies.]{.underline} National [militaries
are]{.underline} less responsible for stalling organized responses to

nat]{.mark}ional [security]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Despite the end of
the Cold War (characterized by a large-scale U.S.-USSR arms race) in
1990, in 2010 world military expenditures were higher than in any year
since the end of the Second World War in 1945. [The United States far
outpaces other countries in military expenditures. [The U.S. accounted
for **thirty-nine percent** of global military
expenditures]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2012, when military expenditures
consumed more than four percent of the U.S. gross domestic product. [The
United States is [among]{.mark} a handful [of the most militarized
countries]{.mark} in the world, as measured by military expenditures per
capita, including Israel, South Sudan, Saudi Arabia, North Korea,
Russia, Jordan, Algeria, and Azerbaijan.]{.underline} Even the world's
poorest countries sport national armies whose weapons and training are
subsidized by or purchased from the world's major arms dealers, most
notably the U.S., Russia, France, United Kingdom, and China. The world's
militaries are historically hyper-masculine institutions with cultures
embracing honor, bravery, loyalty, strength, and violence. [Men dominate
the ranks and leadership of military institutions just as they dominate
national politics and economics around the world.]{.underline} In the
United States, the military plays a critical role in scientific
research, including climate change research. [The U.S. Department of
Defense (DOD) has a basic scientific research and development budget
that is two and a half times greater than the National Science
Foundation (NSF)]{.underline} --- the agency tasked with funding basic
research across the sciences, mathematics, and engineering. The NSF has
a broad mission of supporting transformative research on all topics and
issues across disciplines[. The DOD's much narrower mission is to
protect national security. This focus on security --- food security,
energy security, water security, and environmental security ---
determines the research projects it supports.]{.underline} As a result,
the DOD has been a powerful voice in emphasizing national security
dangers from and defenses against climate change and in shaping the work
of the many researchers it supports in universities, industry, and
national labs and research facilities. [[The DOD's agenda
reflects]{.mark} classical military/[**masculine tactics** for attacking
c]{.mark}limate [c]{.mark}hange: [large-scale geo-engineering]{.mark}
approaches to manage solar radiation or [sequester carbon]{.mark},
energy research focused on [military missions]{.mark}, [conflict]{.mark}
scenario [planning]{.mark}, climate forecasting and modeling, and global
resource assessments.]{.underline} The DOD has very limited interest in
funding "softer" (feminine) research topics on the health, social,
racial, gender, or age disparities in climate change impacts, factors
that promote community resilience in the face of disasters, or
strategies for reducing the carbon emissions causing climate change.
[[Another]{.mark} important gendered feature of the climate change
policy landscape is the funding and organization of climate change
denialism. Major **[disinformation]{.mark}** **[campaigns]{.mark}**
[have been orchestrated by]{.mark} mainly **[male]{.mark} climate change
[skeptics]{.mark}** in the U.S.]{.underline} Their message has been
embraced by powerful partisan climate denialists in congress who have
obstructed federal governmental efforts to regulate or aggressively
reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Despite scientific agreement about the
causes of climate change and the necessary actions to slow the rise of
global temperatures and sea levels, climate skeptics have managed to
create political gridlock around climate change mitigation and
adaptation. [**[The]{.mark} U.S. [military's emphasis on
security]{.mark}** threats tends to set it above the fray, [and the
political vacuum]{.mark} created by denialists and their industry
supporters has [opened the door for]{.mark} research and planning on the
**[conflict]{.mark}** potential for climate change and the need to
prioritize defending our borders, resources, and way of

[The [displacement of women from productive activity by]{.mark} the

manner [in which]{.mark} development [projects]{.mark} appropriated or
[destroyed]{.mark} the natural resource base for [the production of

productivity]{.underline} both by removing land, water and forests from
their management and control, as well as through the ecological
destruction of soil, water and vegetation systems so that nature\'s
productivity and renewability were impaired. [[While gender
subordination and patriarchy are the oldest oppressions, they]{.mark}
have [take]{.mark}n on new and [more violent forms through]{.mark} the

[[\'Development\']{.mark} was to have been [a post-colonial project, a

**entire world remade itself**]{.mark} on the model of the colonising

exploitation that colonialism entailed. The assumption was that western
style progress was possible for all. [[Development]{.mark}, as the

development based on commercialisation of resource use for commodity
production in the newly independent countries created the internal
colonies.2 [Development was thus reduced to [a continuation of the

article is more analytical and specific. [Cohn addresses [the sexualized
specialized language in the field of nuc]{.mark}lear [weaponry and
strategy]{.mark}. She demonstrates the crucial role of language in
shaping the nuclear strategy.]{.underline} The author notes that this
specialized language is called "technostrategic". [[It contains]{.mark}
a plethora of [metaphors]{.mark}, sexual and religious [imageries,
and]{.mark} sexy [acronyms that distance]{.mark} the [users]{.mark} from
the disasters of war.]{.underline}11 She emphasizes that the use of
technostrategic language enables the defense intellectuals to lessen the
pain, terror, and anxiety of war. It allows the speakers to distance
themselves from the atrocities caused by nuclear weapons.12 Defence
intellectuals' language does not allow them to take into account the
impact of nuclear weapons on human beings[. By using this technical
[terminology such as "clean bombs]{.mark}" to refer to nuclear weapons
[and]{.mark} ["collateral damage]{.mark}" to [describe]{.mark} human
death and [mass murder,]{.mark} defense [intellectuals feel disconnected
from human reality]{.mark}.]{.underline} Using a sexualized language
that completely ignores the human dimension of nuclear technology,
strips away emotions and isolates the users from the destruction that
occurs, but it does not diminish or attenuate people's pain and
suffering.

[Besides, Cohn argues that this [technostrategic language was designated
from the beginning to discuss weapons]{.mark}, therefore, it does not
concern human life.]{.underline} Accordingly, since the human dimension
is completely neglected in this specialized language, talking about it
makes one's concerns and remarks illegitimate and irrelevant. [[If one
wants to discuss nucl]{.mark}ear [strategy, one needs to master]{.mark}
the [existing sexualized]{.mark} [terminology]{.mark}. Otherwise, their
points would not be taken into consideration. This puts the person in
front of a significant dilemma: using the correct terminology to be
heard by the defense intellectuals or speaking according to one's values
and principles.]{.underline} They silence voices from outside by forcing
others to use the sexualized concepts when they want to address nuclear
weaponry issues,. For instance, as a person who is not part of the
defense intellectuals' committee and does not have a technical
background in nuclear weaponry, whenever I think about nuclear
technology, I automatically visualize the horrifying devastation caused
by these terrifying weapons, injured people, wounded souls, severe pain,
and brutal cruel massacres.

[Cohn also demonstrates that the technostrategic language is essentially
used to address the issue of nuclear weaponry from the user's viewpoint
and not that of the victims. [The introduction of]{.mark} the
[sexual]{.mark} component in the [terminology]{.mark} of the abstract
language[, such as "erector launchers]{.mark}", "[deep
penetration]{.mark}", ["big stick"]{.mark} and the extensive use of
metaphors dehumanize and [minimize]{.mark} the [disasters caused by the
deadly murderous weapons]{.mark}.]{.underline} At the end of her
article, Cohn suggests that feminists need to deconstruct the euphemism
and abstractions used in the technostrategic

language and to reconstruct and develop an alternative conception of
rationality.13

Cohn has convincingly highlighted the masculinist nature of the nuclear
weaponry field. [[Most]{.mark} of the [intellectuals are males]{.mark}
and the language is sexist and sexualized.]{.underline} However, she did
not elaborate on how feminists should deconstruct and reconstruct the
technostrategic language. She also failed to address women's involvement
in nuclear technology and their accountability for crimes against
humanity and war crimes.

In fine, [[both authors criticize]{.mark} [the IR gendered paternalist
discourse]{.mark} and the masculinist world of IR, but they did not
suggest any solution to include women more into foreign policy
decision-making positions and how to introduce women's issues in foreign
policies.]{.underline} They also failed to assess whether the feminist
IR critique is deemed successful in reconstructing the IR discipline. It
is true that the main contribution that feminist IR theories made in the
field are to think beyond the existing dichotomies of public/private and
national/international. [[They provide a new perspective on crucial
issues]{.mark} discussed by IR scholars. Their introduction of gender
and women in the analysis, redefinition, and reconceptualization of IR
main [concepts like "Power" and "Security", made us rethink and change
the way in which we perceive and understand central concepts in the IR
discipline.]{.mark}]{.underline} Nevertheless, the question that keeps
arising is: is the feminist challenge to conventional IR theories
fruitful in reconstructing the IR discipline?

Theoretical underpinnings: feminist approaches to Arctic oil and gas

Feminist scholarship has brought attention to the role of gender,
intersectionality and gendered structures within Arctic research, which
have previously been overlooked (see, e.g. Hoogensen Gjørv, 2017;
Kuokkanen, 2007; Seag, Badhe, & Choudhry, 2020; Sinevaara-Niskanen,
2015, 2019; Vladimirova & Habeck, 2018). Nevertheless, even though
gender has emerged to the agenda of Arctic politics and research already
20 years ago (see, e.g. Taking Wing conference 2002), "gender has
remained a 'feature' relevant to certain issues only and an attribute of
certain people (women) only" (Sinevaara-Niskanen, 2015). While some
research exists on masculinities in the Arctic (see, e.g. Ventsel,
2018), in addition to other intersecting identities, gender has yet to
become a primary category for defining social and political relations in
the Arctic (Hoogensen Gjørv, 2017). The [[historical
**narrative**]{.mark} of the [Arctic as]{.mark} a **[frontier]{.mark}**,
as a territory to be **conquered**]{.underline} (Aarekol, 2016; Ryall et
al., 2010; Vladimirova & Habeck, 2018), has also [impacted the ways in
which energy companies frame the Arctic region]{.underline}. Jackman et
al. (2020) reflect on the concepts of terrain and territory, encouraging
a feminist perspective for approaching and re-crafting them. This allows
expanding the historical approach towards understanding a region like
the Arctic, which has been ["told and retold as a story of **control**
enabled by calculative technologies"]{.underline} (Jackman et al., 2020,
p.3). The history of Arctic (male) explorers and, for example,
[glaciology, in which the performance of masculinity determined the
dominant knowledge within the field]{.underline} (Carey et al., 2016;
Hevly, 1996), have also [impacted current narratives]{.underline} on the
region. Jackman et al. (2020) argue that the [**historical**
conceptualizations linked with masculinity]{.underline}, such as those
positioned within the Arctic as a space, [should be questioned to better
understand the **current** ones]{.underline}. One reason for the narrow
focus on gender issues within Arctic research has to do with the
[[modernist project of mastering nature]{.mark} and the image of the
Arctic,]{.underline} which underlines the [[**heroism** of the (male)
explorers]{.mark} or male workers [overcoming]{.mark} the [harsh
conditions]{.mark} affecting the oil, reindeer herding or mineral
**extraction** industries]{.underline} (Vladimirova & Habeck, 2018).
Introducing feminist approaches to the masculine arena of the Arctic
hydrocarbon industry is a way to shed light on the values underpinning
it. Tickner, a pioneer in feminist international relations, suggested
already in 1992 that in order to achieve an ecologically secure future,
the system of values must simultaneously respect nature, women and
diversity of cultures -- "norms that have been missing from the
historical practices of statecraft" (Tickner, 1992, p.126) and
undoubtedly from the global oil regime as well. In this article, I
approach the oil and gas production from a feminist social
constructivist perspective, building on valuable discussions in feminist
international relations and feminist geography. By applying a feminist
constructivist approach to identify how energy companies justify their
practices, the article adopts three underlining assumptions: first, the
understanding that [language **matters** and has the power to construct
the world and the dominant narratives and discourses within
it]{.underline}. Second, the assumption that [the material produced by
the companies has a **political** meaning and the power to **shape
narratives** in relation to Arctic politics]{.underline} (Lempinen,
2019b; Livesey, 2002; Scarce & Ockwell, 2010), and third, [the
recognition that the **role of gender** and unequal power dynamics
between gendered discourses **impact Arctic issues**]{.underline}
(Hoogensen Gjørv, 2017; Sinevaara-Niskanen, 2019; 2015).

Entanglements of gender and fossil fuels

Comprehending fossil fuel production requires accounting for its
multiple societal dimensions, such as gender, race and class. The
literature discussing gender within extractive industries usually refers
to women's roles; however, [gender as an analytical tool could and
should be broadened to examine the masculinities and femininities within
the oil and gas industry]{.underline} as well as other intersecting
identities and structures. In this paper, the [concept of gender refers
to **socially constructed** identities and differences between the
categories of men and women, which allude to the characteristics
assigned to the categories of masculine and feminine]{.underline}. These
categories are always culturally specific and change over time (Connell
& Pearse, 2014; Hoogensen Gjørv, 2017; Tickner, 2001). [[Extractive
industries]{.underline}]{.mark} have been argued to [[belong to a
culture of masculinity]{.underline}]{.mark} (Daggett, 2018; Kojola,
2019; Miller, 2004), and they have [**[historically]{.mark}** been
rather **[male dominated]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Daggett (2018) has
forcefully argued that [[there is a relationship between **fossil
fuels** and the **white patriarchal order**]{.underline}]{.mark},
proposing the concept of **[[petro-masculinity]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Miller (2004) has examined the oil industry in Alberta, Canada, and
concluded [three aspects constructing masculinity [within the
industr]{.mark}y]{.underline}: "[everyday interactions which **exclude**
women; values and beliefs specific to the dominant occupation of
engineering which **reinforce** gender divisions; and a consciousness
derived from the powerful symbols of the **frontier myth** and the
romanticized cowboy **hero**"]{.underline} (Miller, 2004, p.47). In the
Arctic, the [history of exploration together with the [idea of
**conquering**]{.mark} **nature** has been updated and [**transferred**
to]{.mark} the [modern **hydrocarbon industry**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
(Female) gender is missing from the energyscape in the Barents region
(Lempinen, 2018). The imagery and role models visible to the public to
affect perceptions of the industry (European Institute for Gender
Equity, 2016, p.6). Nevertheless, the dichotomy between femininity and
masculinity is no longer so simplistic within the modern hydrocarbon
industry in Norway and Russia, or within the Arctic, and "the debate is
already moving beyond such stereotypes and structural limitations"
(Vladimirova & Habeck, 2018, p.148). In this article I focus on the
justifications utilized to support the continuing production as well as
on the construction of gender. When analyzing the material, it became
evident that especially in the Russian context, [the presentation of
gender meant a presentation of masculinity]{.underline}, as the majority
of the people presented in the webpages were male. Connell, a pioneer in
masculinity studies, emphasizes that [we should discuss masculinities,
not masculinity]{.underline}. Multiple masculinities exist within a
certain gender order (Connell, 1995) and the performance on masculinity
relies "on maneuvering between several competing [[gender
regimes]{.mark} which [function within historical gender
orders]{.mark}]{.underline}" such as the Soviet and post-Soviet context
(Yusupova, 2016, p.31). [The construction and [performance]{.mark} of
various masculinities can be only [done within]{.mark} a certain
[framework laid out by the state]{.mark}]{.underline} (Yusupova, 2016).
For instance, Vladimir Putin's "hypermasculinity" is playing a crucial
role in the contemporary re-masculinization of Russia (Sperling, 2015;
Yusupova, 2016). Ventsel (2018) has examined the dominant masculinities
in Siberia, specifically in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), where the
[discourse of conquering nature has **deep roots**]{.underline}. In
Soviet times, Yakutia was one of the nation's resource-extraction
frontiers, characterized by a pronounced proletarian "hard" masculinity
that continued well into the 2000s. Recently, according to Ventsel, more
urban, "softer" masculinities have emerged (Ventsel 2018, pp.210-- 211).
The [masculine identity of an oil worker]{.underline} that provides for
his family is an important incentive to [work in the "extreme"
North]{.underline} (Saxinger 2015, p.95). However, it is noteworthy that
the [evolution towards stricter definition of gender roles can be
interpreted as a result of **colonial** regimes and
**modernization**]{.underline}, also in the context of the Russian (and
Norwegian) north (Vladimirova & Habeck, 2018; Ziker, 2010), since many
[**indigenous** cultures have traditionally not had binary gender
division and roles]{.underline}.

What do masculinities look like in the Nordic context, specifically in
Norway?

An interesting concept introduced by Hultman (2013) is **[ecomodern
masculinity]{.underline}**. In the 1990s, the discourse of ecomodernism
began to expand globally, wherein economic growth provides the basis for
transition to a more sustainable future (Hultman, 2013; Anshelm &
Hultman, 2014). Hultman suggests that with ecomodern masculinity,
[gender identity is connected to care for the environment and economic
growth]{.underline}. Anshelm & Hultman (2014) noted that with industrial
masculinity shifting towards ecomodern masculinity, an emphasis on
toughness and hardness is replaced by care and responsibility. Those
ascribing to the new ecomodern masculinity still desire to expand
economic growth via technological progress but do so while
simultaneously caring for the environment (Anshelm & Hultman, 2014). The
notion of ecomodern masculinity therefore encompasses attempts to
address environmental problems, especially climate change, while
supporting policies and technologies connected to climate-destroying
systems (Anshelm & Hultman, 2014; Hultman 2013). Ecomodern masculinity
can be linked to the concept of green economy, in which the green
economy offers an arena for economic opportunities, achieved by
technological solutions (Caprotti & Bailey, 2014). The ecomodern
discourse is strongly present within the claims currently made by Arctic
hydrocompanies, which argue that they are combining technology and
ecology, an argument that [ultimately serves the interests of continuing
to drill for oil and gas]{.underline}. [The narrative of territory
(especially in the Arctic context) has been characterized by the
"dominance of a calculative lens"]{.underline} (Jackman et al., 2020,
p.2) emphasizing the role of technology. In a similar vein, feminist
scholars have criticized the [[framing]{.mark} of [climate change
as]{.mark} a [tech]{.mark}nological [challenge]{.mark}]{.underline}
(see, e.g. Haraway, 2016; MacGregor, 2010, 2009) and likewise politics
of energy transitions have been criticized for their [technocratic
description that [ignores]{.mark} gender and [social
dimensions]{.mark}]{.underline} (Lieu et al., 2020). [While responding
to the challenges of ecological crises with green techno-scientific
innovations **has value**, the technological focus **also** [enables
"searching for the new rather than improving the
old]{.mark}]{.underline}; more omnipotence rather than humble reflection
on the benefits and the costs of male-dominated scientific ingenuity to
date" (MacGregor, 2009, p.133). In her writing, MacGregor (2010) has
examined the [politics of climate change and argues that it is framed by
gendered discourses]{.underline}. She has demonstrated how the social
constructs of masculinity and femininity emerge and are reproduced
within the dominant discourses. Her work identifies [[**ecological
modernization** and **environmental security**]{.mark} as [**top-down**
approaches connected to **masculinity**]{.mark}]{.underline}, whereas,
for example, the [[**individual** duty]{.mark} to protect the
environment is [linked to **femininity**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(MacGregor, 2010). Feminist scholars have criticized traditional
[[ecomodernist solutions]{.underline}]{.mark} that have [simultaneously
[facilitated]{.mark} a "[**downgrading** of **ethical**
concerns,]{.mark}" such as justice, economic equity or
healt]{.underline}h (MacGregor, 2009, p.128). Feminist (and
postcolonial) perspectives should be laid out as a counterpoint to
technological understandings of the earth (Jackman et al., 2020) and
remain at the center when new terrains are explored (Jackman et al.,
2020; Squire & Dodds, 2020). Feminist discussions on environment
[highlight the significance of care and ethics within climate
change]{.underline}, especially in relation to future generations and
global inequalities (see, e.g. Powys & Cuomo, 2017; Robinson, 2011).
Care is not a property of feminist research; however, its idea is often
embedded within feminist ideas on, for example, human and non-human
(Bauhardt & Harcourt, 2019). The question of future generations is
embedded within feminist ethics of care, which becomes an important
issue with the opening of new oil and gas fields in the Arctic.
[**[Extractivism]{.mark}**, and more specifically oil and gas drilling,
arises from the **[ontological premise]{.mark}** where understanding of
the [land]{.mark} and having ["permission" to use]{.mark} it are based
on an [**anthropocentric**, Western **division** between
**human**]{.mark} beings [and **nature**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is
[extremely visible in the exploitation of the Arctic fossil fuels, made
possible with the help of modern technology]{.underline}. [Technology is
not created in a vacuum; rather, it is the product of longstanding
historical sociopolitical developments]{.underline} (Jasanoff, 2015). In
a similar manner to Haraway, who has identified how [society worships
science and forgets its own role in its creatio]{.underline}n (1991,
p.8), the present study identifies and problematizes the dominance of
technology, especially within an industry that greatly contributes to
global emissions, and hence, has an influence on more than just the
Arctic region.

Method and material: justification analysis of Arctic hydrocarbon
companies' self-representation

This paper examines Norwegian and Russian companies' perceptions of the
Arctic and the image they model for the public with material consisting
of sections of three Arctic energy company webpages. I approach the
webpages through a feminist version of justification analysis, including
some discussion on visual methods. Justification analysis builds on the
work of Boltanski and Thévenot, De La Justification (On Justification,
1991\[2006\]). Their core idea is that [in order to convince other
people in public discussion, one must justify such a position by
referring to a generally accepted common goo]{.underline}d[. Within
public debates, a limited set of moral principles is utilised to support
such arguments. For example, justifying a claim in economic terms means
taking a moral stand wherein money is the measure of worth]{.underline}
(YläAnttila & Luhtakallio, 2016, p.2). Moral principles are widely
shared by different participants but are often understood differently
(Ylä-Anttila & Luhtakallio, 2016). [In the context of the Arctic
hydrocarbon industry, justification analysis is useful in revealing and
challenging the values on which the companies base their continuous
operations]{.underline}. Understandings of the "common good" vary across
time and society; however, Boltanski and Thevénot have proposed six
"worlds of justification" based on values commonly recognised by
societies in general. The seventh justification was added later. The
fixed [frames, or worlds, of justification are based on values emerging
from the industrial, civic, market-oriented, fame-driven, ecological,
domestic and inspirational domains]{.underline}. Boltanski and Thevénot
(2006, pp.203--201) describe the industrial world as one dominated by
technology, efficiency and progress. In the context of this article, the
industrial world refers to the importance of new technologies being
utilised by the Arctic oil and gas industry as well as the importance of
technology in addressing environmental concerns. The civic world is one
where value is not given to individuals, but to the collectives they
form. Legal systems and civic rights are the basis of this value
(Boltanski & Thévenot, 2006, pp.185--193) as well as democratic means of
agreeing on the rules (Ylä-Anttila & Luhtakallio, 2016). In this
research, the worlds based on civic values refer to the companies'
responsibility to produce energy for the world, to work within the
constraints of existing legislation and to bring benefits to local
communities. In the market world, "actions are motivated by desire"
(Boltanski & Thévenot, 2006, p.196). Objects considered worthy of desire
are those that have value or a strong position in the market. Therefore,
the market world refers here to the economic value of the Arctic
hydrocarbon industry both for the companies' shareholders and for the
respective countries. Within the world of fame, the opinion of others
plays a crucial role, in addition to visibility and notoriety. Being
recognised for what one does is important (Boltanski & Thévevnot, 2006).
In the context of this study, fame is understood and presented as the
companies being perceived as leaders and pioneers in the Arctic realm,
much in the manner of early polar explorers. In the ecological world
well-being of the environment is the focal point (Thévevnot, Moody, &
Lafaye, 2000). In this study, the ecological world refers to the
well-being of the pristine Arctic environment and its flora and fauna.
In the domestic world, according to Boltanski and Thévenot (2006,
pp.164--165), the worth given to the objects is based on their
contribution to hierarchical relations among people, as connected to
generations and tradition. In the research material, the domestic world
can be understood as the value that, for example, the gas distribution
system in Russia brings to the country. The inspirational world was not
visible in the research material and so will not be a point of focus in
this research. From this initial premise, scholars have developed a
method of [justification analysis]{.underline} (Ylä-Anttila & Kukkonen,
2014; Ylä-Anttila & Luhtakallio, 2016[) to analyse the claims made and
the moral stands taken in public debates.]{.underline} Within public
media justification analysis, [a unit of analysis consists of one claim.
A claim is a "unit of action in the public sphere"]{.underline}
(Koopmans, 2006). [A claim can be a statement]{.underline} made to a
reporter, [a speech, or,]{.underline} for example, [a
demonstration]{.underline} (Koopmans, 2006; Ylä-Anttila & Luhtakallio,
2016). Once such a claim is made, justification analysis assesses the
given worth or value upon it is based. A combination of values can be
found in a single claim. As with many social science methods, the coding
of the claims is not inductive, but based on fixed categories -- the
worths. Therefore, [justification analysis is **especially** suitable
for **comparative analysis**, as the cases are approached from the same
justification principles]{.underline} (Ylä-Anttila & Luhtakallio, 2016).
Justification analysis has been utilised mainly for analysing mass media
(Ylä-Anttila et al., 2018; Ylä-Anttila & Kukkonen, 2014; Ylä-Anttila &
Luhtakallio, 2016) but also for Russian energy strategies (Salonen,
2018). Employing justification analysis to assess company webpages
differs somewhat from the analysis of traditional media material. The
webpages of hydrocarbon companies exist for a certain reason -- the
webpages themselves are crafted to convince the audience of the validity
of the claims. Therefore, while a newspaper article may contain, for
example, three claims for a story, I argue that a webpage itself is one
large claim, and the analysis aims to identify the nature of the values
upon which the individual underlying claims are based. Following the
path laid out by Ylä-Anttila and Luhtakallio (2016) and Salonen (2018),
I first determined the sections of the material that contained a
specific claim. Second, I identified claims that make a reference to a
world (or worlds). Finally, I identified and categorised the claims and
their references according to the fixed worlds of justification. For
example, going through the webpages of Equinor, I first identified the
sections that made a specific claim (e.g. section Sustainability) and
after that went through the content sentence by sentence and identified
the claims that refer to the fixed worlds of justification (e.g.
ecological world). Because this research is qualitative in nature, the
frequency of the claims is not discussed extensively, but rather the
focus is on their content. Since the material consists of webpages, it
would be limiting to exclude a large portion of their content -- images.
We live in an era of visuality, and so visual analysis should not be
ignored when analysing webpages. Hence, this article also draws from
discussions on visual methodology to present the webpages in their
entirety. Haraway (1988, p.581) has explored social power relations with
respect to the availability of visual "gluttony" and how it is linked to
a "history of science tied to militarism, capitalism, colonialism, and
male supremacy." Such power relations produce social differences (e.g.
hierarchies of class, gender, race), while claiming to not belong to any
hierarchy (Haraway, 1988). This is especially interesting when
considering oil and gas companies, as the fossil fuel industry is one of
the most powerful industries in the world.

Webpages utilised to create a desire for Arctic exploration

The material for this article consists of certain sections from the
webpages of three hydrocarbon companies (collected in summer/fall 2019)
working in the Arctic. The webpages of energy companies tend to
represent a general company policy -- or at least what the companies
expect the public to perceive positively, and therefore, the webpages
help them gain public support. The webpages presumably target the
national political sphere, international consumer states, investors and
civil society. The audience is not homogeneous -- therefore,
justification strategies differ. [By studying the material produced by
the energy industry, one can "understand better what kind of power,
truths and identities" the industry is constructing]{.underline}
(Tynkkynen, 2016, p.375). The [energy industry utilises advertising to
"establish a desire for opening Arctic regions to commercial
exploitation"]{.underline} (Mason, 2016). I do not approach the
[webpages]{.underline} as sources of a single truth, but rather as a
[way for the industry to present its claims to the public]{.underline}.
The webpages of state-owned companies are clearly an aspect of
marketing, but also a tool and even a platform for discussion. The
webpages actively stake out a position for companies in societal
discussions. For example on Equinor's webpage, a section focusing on the
activities in the Barents Sea includes a sub-section Concerns and
Frequently asked questions, with both sections directly addressing the
concerns of environmental organisations about Arctic drilling (see, e.g.
Greenpeace Norge). Gazprom Neft's webpages only discuss the
environmental effects of an individual project regarding Prirazlomnoye,
an offshore platform that received much international attention in 2013
when Greenpeace activists were arrested for trying to seize the
operation for environmental reasons (Greenpeace Russia, 2019).
Prirazlomnoye, however, is currently the only offshore project in the
Russian Arctic, which could further raise environmental concerns linked
to it. Comparisons of the Norwegian, Russian and English webpages
revealed that the content on the webpages was approximately the same
regardless of the language. Hence, this study is limited to the English
versions of the company webpages. The webpages are rich in content and
consist of text, photos, videos and reports. To begin, I went through
all the sections to get an idea of their content. Next, I focused on the
sections connected to Arctic hydrocarbon activities. The homepages of
all the companies and company overviews provided were included in the
analysis. In addition, other parts focus on ongoing Arctic projects
(with subsections) as well as on activities in the Arctic (for example,
Equinor's webpages include sections such as Our activities in the North
and Safely exploring the Barents Sea). Sections focusing on the
environment, sustainability and engagement with indigenous peoples (for
example, Gazprom Neft's webpages include a section on Engaging with the
peoples of the Russian Far North) were included. The webpages ranged
from August to October 2019. Since the webpages are "living," meaning
they are being continuously updated, the material was transferred to
separate documents and the analysis was conducted from there.

**[The gendered worlds of justification]{.underline}**

After reading through the research material with the help of
justification analysis, six worlds of justification and their
combinations were identified. Based on the findings, the following four
subsections have been organized thematically. The first subsection
addresses the [importance of technology and its ability to overcome both
physical challenges as well as challenges related to climate change and
the environment]{.underline}. The second subsection focuses on the [role
of the economy]{.underline}. In addition, it also [compares early polar
explorers with the search for new oil and gas fields as well as the
discourse of being an Arctic leader]{.underline}. The third subsection
assesses the meaning of the ecological world in the webpages.
Furthermore, it also focuses on the [representations of
gender]{.underline}. The fourth subsection discusses the companies'
[emphasis on the wider benefits of having an industry in one's country
and community]{.underline}. The [first two subsections]{.underline} and
the worlds they present navigate in the discursive and cultural
constructions [historically associated with masculine practices, working
in the public domain instead of the private]{.underline}. The last two
subsections move somewhere in between masculine and feminine discursive
and cultural constructions (MacGregor, 2010). The analysis shows how the
companies are [building the justifications while **reproducing** and
**reinforcing** the **gendered foundations** and
stereotypes]{.underline}. Excerpts from the research material are
utilized to demonstrate how the justifications serve the interests of
oil and gas companies.

Industrial world -- technology will save us?

Since the companies are working in harsh conditions, the role of
technology is important. All the companies put an especially visible
focus on the industrial world. Justifications based on technological
measures and the belief in technology are strong: Drawing on technology,
competence and experience from harsh weather operations, we are
approaching the North with a strong focus on safe operations and respect
for the environment. Research and development programs are tailored to
meet the technological challenges ahead, such as drilling and production
systems, long distance transportation of unprocessed oil and gas,
material science, oil spill response and health and working environment
in cold climates. (Equinor, 2019) Unique technological and logistical
solutions mean oil is being produced, stored, shipped and transported
all year round under the ultra-challenging environmental and climatic
conditions of the waters of the Arctic. (Gazprom Neft, 2019) Overcoming
the Yamal Peninsula's harsh climate and environment, Gazprom has made
Yamal its launch pad for efficient, safe and innovative technologies and
technical solutions. (Gazprom, 2019) An emphasis on technology and
infrastructure utilized within the operations conducted in the harsh
conditions of the Arctic is visible throughout the webpages. In
addition, technology is important for the challenges of addressing
environmental questions. The visual side of the material emphasises the
technologyoriented nature of the industry -- a large number of the
photos on all the company websites show production facilities and
provide technical details. Often, the images are from a bird's-eye
perspective observing the production facilities or the Arctic
wilderness. This reminds me of Haraway's concept of the god trick "of
seeing everything from nowhere," in which [modern technology has "put
the myth into ordinary practice. And like the god trick, this eye fucks
the world to make techno-monsters"]{.underline} (Haraway, 1988, p.581).
The opening image on Gazprom's website is an aerial image of Europe at
nighttime with electric lights shining in every corner of the region,
presumably powered by Russian gas. Equinor has a similar photo of
Scandinavia, in a section on Safely Exploring in the Barents Sea. In all
three cases, several images show oil rigs, production facilities and
ships surrounded by ice -- from the bird's-eye or "god" perspective. In
Haraway's writing, [god trick is connected to a larger **dilemma of
objectivity**, which in feminist understanding is **never** completely
possible, as knowledge is **always situated**.]{.underline} Such
[**objectivity** and "knowing all"]{.underline} are also [related
to]{.underline} what Connell and Pearse (2014) write in relation to
climate change, specifically [how "gender research into environmental
politics shows that a **masculine God-like view** of the global problem
has merged into **technocratic**, marketized 'solutions' to
environmental crisis.]{.underline}" The imagery of industrial facilities
supports justifications based on the industrialized technological world.
The [claims based on industrial world **represent** and **reproduce** a
**masculine value system** building on the ability to **control** nature
and harness its resources for a commodity of humans]{.underline}. Laying
the groundwork for ecomodern discourse, claims based on the
industrial-ecological world are substantial. The nature of the
references varies somewhat between the companies. While Gazprom's claims
with respect to technology and the environment are more pragmatic and
linked to direct environmental issues, those of Equinor and Gazprom Neft
[highlight technology as a tool for solving problems stemming from
climate change]{.underline}. Gazprom prioritizes innovative development
and advancement from the technological and organizational standpoints as
the key prerequisites for the efficient and sustainable development of
the oil and gas sector and Russia's fuel and energy complex at large.
(Gazprom, 2019) One of today's most urgent problems---climate
change---is connected to environmental emissions of \[greenhouse
gases\]. Gazprom Neft is doing its bit to address this problem with a
programme to increase the productive use of associated petroleum gas
(APG) produced in oil production as well as concurrently implementing
several major projects in this area. (Gazprom Neft, 2019). It's
supplying the world with energy, creating value for society---and not
least, reducing CO2 emissions from production by up to 90%. The Paris
Agreement is quite clear that the world will still need oil as part of
its energy mix. But which oil is produced, should be produced as cleanly
as possible. (Equinor, 2019) These descriptions draw attention to
technology's role in addressing environmental issues and to the
companies' pioneering role in dealing with environmental problems. [[New
projects]{.mark} are [justified through their capacity to
operate]{.mark} as cleanly as possible]{.underline}. According to the
Norwegian actor, oil needs to be drilled and Equinor can do it in the
best (cleanest and safest) way possible. [This [**framing** of climate
change via technological solutions is]{.mark} an example of the
[**masculinization** of responses to c]{.mark}limate [c]{.mark}hange,
where [solutions]{.mark} come [from]{.mark} the traditional [domain of
men and **hegemonic masculinity**]{.mark}]{.underline} (MacGregor,
2010). In Norway, and to a certain extent in Russia too, the [discourse
regarding the harmony of economic growth via technology and
environmental protection can also be connected to the discussion on
ecomodern masculinities]{.underline} (Anshelm & Hultman, 2014; Hultman,
2013).

Worlds of market and fame -- economic heroism

When discussing the justifications offered by the energy companies
working in the Arctic, a rationalist approach would assume that economic
reasons are the main objective for expanding production. However, all
three companies rarely make claims based purely on market worth. Claims
based on the market world thus refer to economic value, but not solely.
Gazprom and Gazprom Neft refer to [pragmatic actions aiming at cost
efficiency]{.underline}. Equinor's claims emphasize local economic
development and the creation of value for its stakeholders. When
bringing promising fields into production, Gazprom aims to ensure
economic efficiency by expanding gas production facilities concurrently
with gas transmission, comprehensive processing and storage capacities.
(Gazprom, 2019) Supported by this the company is able to ensure
year-round shipments of all oil produced, at minimal cost. (Gazprom
Neft, 2019) Through our core business and supply chain, we create
economic value and opportunities for society and communities. We create
jobs and develop capabilities among our own employees and beyond our
company. (Equinor, 2019) The lack of claims based purely on market worth
indicates that the companies are responding to changing expectations in
the international context surrounding emerging climate concerns, by
recognizing that it is not acceptable to base arguments purely on
economic growth. [Like technology, economy is not something created in a
**vacuum**, but instead it is always a **gendered** human
**construct**]{.underline} (Mellor, 2017). The ecofeminist notion on
political economy is relevant for discussing the market world and the
capitalist system where the companies are working: "[Instead of seeing
economies as natural forms based on universal economic laws, ecofeminist
political economy sees modern economies as ecologically unsustainable
and socially unjust]{.underline}" (Mellor, 2017, p.86). Economy, as we
currently know it, is based on the exploitation of nature and its
resources. The circulation of the concept of [[green economy]{.mark} has
[impacted]{.mark} the ways [how companies **address** the
public]{.mark}]{.underline}. The renaissance of the concept has affected
how businesses work and frame themselves in order to survive (Caprotti &
Bailey, 2014). Earlier research on the U.S-based oil company Exxon
Mobil's advertorial [campaign addressing climate change in 2000 reveals
the company's [aim to present]{.mark} business and [technology as
**saviors**]{.mark} while at the same time showcasing environmental
protection as the enemy]{.underline} (Livesey, 2002). In today's world,
even Russian companies cannot deny the environmental impact of the
industry, and therefore such claims have dropped the business rhetoric
but retained the idea of [technology as a savior]{.underline}. The
[notion of [competition]{.mark} found in the research material does
[not]{.mark} refer [only]{.mark} to [market competition]{.mark}, but
similarly to the [**competition** for]{.mark} Arctic
**[leadership]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This can be linked to the world of
fame. The companies' websites make frequent references to being an
Arctic leader and refer to the polar explorers of earlier times.
[Equinor actively compares the current explorations for new hydrocarbon
fields with the polar explorers of the early 20th century]{.underline}.
The polar explorers of Norway, already a source of national pride, are
portrayed as "paving the way" for modern explorers like Equinor. Thanks
to a long lasting maritime tradition and experience dealing with harsh
environments, Norway has fostered some of the greatest ocean and polar
explorers in history. Building on a heritage of adventures, Equinor has
become a world-leading explorer for oil and gas. (Equinor, 2019) The
characteristics of early polar explorers, such as "aspirations,
persistence, boldness, creativity and knowledge" (Equinor, 2019), are
crucial for the modern explorer as well. This is notable from a feminist
perspective, as [the celebrated early polar explorers were virtually
always men]{.underline}. [Representations of their deeds stood at the
intersection of "heroic adventure, patriotism, honor and
manliness"]{.underline} (Ryall et al., 2010). Even though the early
polar explorers did not exactly aim to secure the large-scale
utilization of natural resources in the same way as modern hydrocarbon
companies, a certain discourse of conquering the north and nature
already existed. [The idea of **conquering** the Arctic as polar
explorers or [being a **leader**]{.mark} in the region speaks again in
the language of **Anthropocene** and **coloniality**, [ignoring]{.mark}
the possible [harm to nature or]{.mark} the ([indigenous]{.mark}) people
living in the area.]{.underline} [The will to be a leader in the Arctic
hydrocarbon industry refers not only to the actual oil and gas industry
but also to the wider political context within the Arctic.]{.underline}
Both Equinor and Gazprom emphasize being Arctic leaders, especially
Gazprom. No other country in the world has ever created anything like
this in the Arctic. [This project has no precedent]{.underline} in the
history of the global gas industry. By creating a brand new gas
production center beyond the Arctic Circle, Russia has proven its
leadership in the Arctic. (Gazprom, 2019, quoting CEO Alexey Miller)

World of ecology and the presentation of gender

The biggest and [most obvious]{.underline} controversy arising regarding
oil and gas operations has to do with their consequences for the
environment via global emissions. The Russian discourse on climate
change has different expectations for the need to address climate issues
than the Norwegian one, due to widespread climate denialism in Russia
(Tynkkynen & Tynkkynen, 2018). The extent to which the Russian companies
choose to address climate change, however, differs -- Gazprom Neft's
material mentions climate change or manmade environmental impacts in
several instances, while Gazprom's material refers to climate change
only rarely, with the words greenhouse gas or climate protection
occurring just a couple of times. Gazprom Neft's website focuses on
global climate change in certain sections (such as Environment and
Prirazlomnaye), whereas Gazprom discusses local environmental impacts.
In contrast, Equinor addresses climate change throughout its webpages.
It responds to the problem of global emissions by noting its
responsibility to provide energy: "The world needs more energy than
renewables can provide" (Equinor, 2019). Environmental and ecological
values recently have assumed a prominent place in the public sphere due
to growing awareness about climate change. However, the companies rarely
address the ecological world as such. Equinor offers more frequent
reflection, with Gazprom and Gazprom Neft having less to say about their
impacts on the ecological world: Delaying climate action increases the
challenge. Current climate actions are far from enough to put the world
on a path to keep global warming well below 2 degrees. Global emissions
increased in 2018 to reach an all-time high---and the longer this
continues, the stronger measures will be necessary to reach common
goals. The need is ever more urgent for rapid and significant change.
(Equinor, 2019) Gazprom operates both in densely-populated Russian
regions and in pristine areas across Eastern Siberia, the Far East, the
Extreme North, and the Arctic shelf. No matter the region, the Company
seeks to minimize its environmental impacts. (Gazprom, 2019) Gazprom
Neft endeavours to minimise the negative environmental impact of oil
production and refining whilst ensuring its products meet high
ecological standards. (Gazprom Neft, 2019) The global and local aspects
of the Arctic hydrocarbon industry are at the core of these
justifications. Local problems, such as possible oil spills, can be
solved with technology, while global emissions are harder to tackle. The
global effects of climate change are argued to affect women more
drastically than men, due to the larger proportion of women within the
poorest segments of the population globally. Though this claim is not
unproblematic and has been questioned (see, e.g. Arora-Jonsson, 2011),
it sheds light on the unequal effects of global climate change. Another
issue that must be critically assessed as a part of the hydrocarbon
companies' ecological justifications is the ontology of the environment.
At the centre of ecological well-being is often the idea that the
environment provides sustenance and well-being for all people. Such an
anthropocentric worldview tends to ignore, for example, the well-being
of animals. The division between humans and non-humans is deeply rooted
in most contemporary Western worldviews (see, e.g. Haraway, 1991;
Plumwood, 1993). Arctic animals are well represented in the imagery
utilised by the companies, especially by the Russian companies. However,
hydrocarbon companies may well interpret ecological well-being rather
differently than, for instance, what would constitute ecological
well-being for an Arctic codfish. Though each company discuss
sustainability of the industry, the different dimensions of the concept
need to be evaluated in more detail. Lempinen (2019a) has examined
Arctic energy and sustainability and notes that sustainability means
different things when looked at from different angles. Turning her
attention to the fossil fuel industry, Lempinen (2019a, p.31) asks how
can the extraction of something that is finite by nature ever be
sustainable. Furthermore, when the resource extracted is itself
exacerbating the climate crisis, the framing of it as sustainable is
difficult to justify. Ecofeminism, an approach introduced in earlier
scholarship regarding the connections between gender and the
environment, has embraced the natural connection between women and
nature. Though the essentialist nature of this claim has since been
problematized, for example, sustainable consumption decisions have been
linked more strongly to the female gender (see, e.g. Brough et al.,
2016; Oldrup & Breengaard, 2009). I argue that this idea of females
being more connected to nature is utilized in Equinors webpage and in
their rebranding process. The most significant and visible difference
between the material produced by the Norwegian and Russian companies has
to do with the representation of gender. Roughly half of the images on
Equinor's website depicting people working in various capacities are of
(assumed) women. Equinor also includes a more varied group of ethnic
backgrounds within its imagery. In contrast, Gazprom's and Gazprom
Neft's material typically only show women in the corporate social
responsibility sections, or in a few images of office workers. Equinor's
material shows women working in office jobs as well as in the field, and
especially in contexts related to sustainability. One example of
gendered imagery in Equinor's material can be found in the section on
Johan Svedrup, a new flagship production site presented in the
frontpage. An image shows two women (young, white) in working clothes
(with helmets, ear protectors and yellow overalls) looking happy, with
the caption "It's 2019 and climate strikes are taking place the world
over. So why are we so proud of our new oil field?". I argue that the
combination of the image displaying young females in work overalls and
this caption is intentionally meant to assuage and shift perceptions
regarding the traditional high-emission oil industry and help form an
impression of an industry that is truly changing. The story continues
with a description of the project's low level of emissions compared to
global averages in oil production. Gazprom's and Gazprom Neft's
representation of gender is a masculine one: strong (assumed) men
working in harsh conditions. The visual imagery perpetuates a
traditional "oilman" type of masculinity among white men. In addition,
especially Gazprom utilises many images of "important" (male) figures,
such as politicians, signing deals and so forth. A descriptive example
of such imagery can be found in the section of Gazprom Neft's website on
the Messoyakha field and its levels of production, where three men
wearing warm winter clothes and helmets are shown walking in front of
industrial machinery. The text accompanying the picture states that oil
production at the field has increased 30% since 2018, which is due to
technical and geological initiatives. Several pictures on Gazprom's and
Gazprom Neft's websites show men either at a control board or with
machinery, working inside or outside in harsh climate. The imagery fits
the concept of petromachismo (Etkind, 2014) or petro-masculinity
(Daggett, 2018). While both concepts also refer to the connections
between wealth and fossil fuels, the material presents the men as
hardworking workers, which is also connected to the Soviet heritage.

Domestic and civic worlds -- caring for the communities

In the local context, the Arctic hydrocarbon industry can be seen to
bring numerous benefits. The fossil fuel industry plays significant role
in the local level via revenues as well as by providing energy security
(see, e.g. Arctic Council, 2009). Claims based on the domestic world
highlight the benefits the industry brings to the national and local
levels. Equinor emphasises its instrumentality with respect to local
communities, especially in economic terms (domestic-market worth). In
many sections of its website, Equinor focuses on employment,
highlighting the tax revenue Norway is gaining from the industry. The
oil and gas industry creates positive economic ripple effects, not only
for the many tens of thousands of people directly employed by the oil
industry, but for all Norwegians, in the form of significant tax
revenues for the state. (Equinor, 2019) Gazprom attaches great
importance to its domestic world as well, but in a different way. The
company's website dedicates much space to describing the role of the gas
distribution system for Russia and how it provides energy for all areas.
Moreover, almost every section that discusses machinery mentions they
are produced in Russia. The gas distribution system has become an
important part of peripheral Russia, thereafter creating a hierarchical
position for the different areas of Russia (Tynkkynen, 2016). Through
its gas distribution system, Gazprom places more importance on the
domestic-civic worth strategy as well, emphasising the value created for
Russia and Russians. This perspective is also visible in the website's
discussion of a new Gazprom Neft corporate social responsibility program
called "Home Towns" (Rodnye goroda): We operate on the premise that
anyone living in a small town deserves the same quality of environment
as someone living in a major city. For that reason, the approach we take
is innovative and unusual: investing in our"Home Towns," we strive for
the highest possible standards in all projects we undertake---many of
which are genuinely unique in Russia. (Gazprom Neft, 2019) Equinor's
justification strategies, in contrast, focus more strongly on the civic
world, since its justifications are based on the global need for
providing energy. Gazprom and Gazprom Neft also utilise this argument,
but not as visibly as Equinor. Providing energy for the growing
population of the world can be marketed as caring for the people. The
companies highlight their domestic and civic worth by expressing care
for the people, though from a perspective of a hydrocarbon company. Each
companies' justifications rely strongly on Norwegian and Russian laws
and regulations. In several sections, Equinor justifies its role of
providing more oil and gas (especially from the north) for the growing
population, while simultaneously acknowledging the acuteness of climate
change. [The attention given to future generations is not in the context
of climate change, but that of context of energy security]{.underline}.
There is considerable interest in this exploration since many geologists
believe that most of the remaining undiscovered resources on the
Norwegian continental shelf may be right here in the Barents Sea---and
could be of major benefit to future generations of Norwegians, as well
as a valuable source of energy for the world. (Equinor, 2019) In Norway,
the discussion on future generations is topical. Opposition to the
hydrocarbon industry has grown significantly, for example, in the form
of the court case mentioned earlier. Civic world is also present in the
Russian material in relation to indigenous people, with the websites
providing text as well as imagery to address indigenous concerns. In the
Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, both Gazprom and Gazprom Neft [operate
on land that has traditionally provided home and subsistence to
indigenous people. Relationships of power undeniably impact interactions
between a parastatal company and local indigenous peoples]{.underline},
such as the Nenets. Gazprom and Gazprom Neft both briefly discuss
cooperation efforts with indigenous people in the Yamal district. The
story Bovanenkovo stands still letting deer herds pass portrays an image
of indigenous people, reindeer, and the hydrocarbon company currently
coexisting well. While indigenous Sámi people live in northern Norway,
the context of Norwegian hydrocarbon projects being offshore makes their
situation rather different. All three companies foreground the idea of
caring about people and bringing benefits to local communities when
justifying their worth and contribution to the domestic and civic world
domains. In their view, the fossil fuel industry in the Arctic is caring
for the people and their economic security. Conclusions [Continuing to
drill for oil and gas in the Arctic is not a value neutral
decision.]{.underline} The acceleration of climate change and its
implications are already visible -- it is not a future phenomenon. The
image the Arctic hydrocarbon companies produce of their oil and gas
operations as an inevitable and viable operation needs to be challenged.
[The justifications utilised by the companies push for certain
narratives and produce a certain reality]{.underline} in relation to
Arctic fossil fuels. The premise of [continuing oil and gas drilling in
the Arctic arises from the capitalist, patriarchal and anthropocentric
worldview, in which the [earth is understood as resources]{.mark} for
human beings]{.underline}. This paper reveals the dominant
conceptualisations of which the justifications of the Arctic hydrocarbon
companies are based on. In addition, the paper contributes to emerging
discussions on feminist approaches to the Arctic and demonstrates how
the hydrocarbon industry shapes the discussion through gendered
justifications for continued drilling operations. Furthermore, this
article contributes to the growing body of literature on justification
analysis and moreover acknowledges that visual communication is an
important side of justification, making analysis of visual data an
essential part of justification analysis. The "gendered environmental
discourses frame and shape dominant understandings of the issue", notes
MacGregor (2009, p.127), a point clearly supported by the research
findings presented here. In this paper, I drew attention to the gendered
foundations underpinning the justifications and the social constructs of
masculinity and femininity embedded in the narratives promoted by the
three companies. Furthermore, the article demonstrates how the
justifications of Norwegian and Russian actors rely mainly on values
belonging to masculinist conceptualisations of space (Jackman et al.,
2020) and masculine discursive constructs (MacGregor, 2010, 2009), such
as the belief in techno-scientific solutionism or the need for
leadership in the Arctic. The justifications relying mainly on feminine
sets of values are more subtle, but nonetheless present. The
justifications connected to social constructs of femininity include, for
example, caring about the well-being of local communities and providing
energy for future generations. In addition, I have shown that the
justifications utilised by Norwegian and Russian companies are rather
similar, even though the respective countries are quite different. This
reveals a global paradigm shift in the hydrocarbon industry. At least in
terms of public marketing, firms have gone from simply selling oil to
being sustainable energy companies, even, to a certain extent in Russia.
The choice of research material, the webpages focusing on Arctic oil and
gas exploration, set certain premises and limitations for the worlds
discussed throughout the article. The justifications employed on the
company websites do not necessarily reflect the real-life actions being
taken by them to tackle climate change and conduct operations in a
sustainable manner. In real-life terms, the differences between
Norwegian and Russian companies and their carbon footprints are likely
to be greater. In the Russian Arctic, frequent oil spills from the
pipelines, methane emissions and flaring (burning of any "unnecessary"
petroleum gas) occur, yet reliable numbers are impossible to obtain
(Tynkkynen, 2019). In addition, the justifications found on the webpages
of the two Russian companies must be understood as the result of
mounting global public pressure to express accountability for
environmental impacts. If we assume that economic reasons are the actual
drivers of continuing Arctic oil and gas production, then the companies
would not need to utilise other justifications. Furthermore, the
webpages and the public image of the companies are aimed at the general
public, which is not homogeneous. Therefore, several justification
strategies are offered for different audiences. The Arctic is becoming
an increasingly important, yet vulnerable region because of the warming
climate. As feminism and gender have started to work their way into
Arctic discourses, it is increasingly evident that "gender is everywhere
and nowhere at the same time::: but the relevance of socially embedded
gender hierarchies and practices (for example in the economy) is
ignored" (Sinevaara-Niskanen, 2012, cited in Sinevaara-Niskanen, 2015).
As the environmental crisis of our planet accelerates, it is important
to scrutinise the underlying values and ideas behind the practices
actively contributing to the destruction of the planet. However, instead
of focusing merely on gender, the future (feminist) research on Arctic,
extractivism and environment should focus on the intersections and
explorations of identity and nature.

An [exponentially increasing number of satellites]{.underline} are
forming something akin to a metallic belt around planet Earth. Many of
these [[remote sensors]{.underline}]{.mark} face down to Earth, making
it possible to [[gather]{.mark} various sets of [data from afar]{.mark}.
Without their presence being necessarily felt, they function as "eyes in
the sky"]{.underline} that can span wide distances. [Remote sensing
(RS)]{.underline} in its various forms, technologies, and histories has
sparked responses and criticism from researchers in different
disciplines. To [sense remotely---that is, to gather data through
sensors that exceed the range of the lived experience of the human eye
or the human senses in general1]{.underline} ---is a prolific subject of
research for political history, geography, science and technology
studies, and critical theory (Aday and Livingston, 2009; Bennett et al.,
2022; Cosgrove, 2001; Gabrys, 2019; Gärdebo, 2019; Kurgan, 2013; Parks,
2009). Critical inquiries into RS send us to military and logistical
history but also to questions of scientific (un)certainty, scale,
abstraction, alienation, domination, and objectivity. Early critiques,
like Hannah Arendt's 1958 work, The Human Condition, where she describes
Sputnik as causing not only an alienation from the world
(Weltentfremdung) but also from the Earth (Erdentfremdung) (Arendt,
2016), exemplifies various critical perspectives focused on humanist
questions amid rapid military and technological advancements. In more
recent decades, critical perspectives on RS and GIS (Geographical
Information Systems) have proliferated, especially tackling [the
[imbrication of]{.mark} these [tech]{.mark}nologies [in]{.mark} systems
of [classed, gendered, and racialized domination]{.mark}.]{.underline}2
This article shows how feminist critique of RS has witnessed significant
transformations over recent decades. Feminist critiques have
historically and conceptually been entangled with RS, here focused on
the period after the launch of Sputnik in 1957. This includes whole
Earth images of the 1960s and "70s (famously 'Blue Marble" in 1972) up
to nowadays' intensified usage of satellite composite imagery in public
and economic domains. RS as a set of technologies connected to practices
and imagery has been critiqued by feminist scholars from a variety of
angles and with notable changes over time. While some feminist
researchers critique on-the-ground methods for their assumption of
accessibility, others critique RS for its detached distance. Meanwhile,
yet others problematize these latter critiques for being external to any
practical implementation and, therefore, themselves "too distant." In
these different critiques, "distance" matters on different levels, which
this article addresses through an integrated historical and conceptual
review. As feminist thought has evolved, with [technology becoming more
ubiquitous]{.underline}, climate crises growing more urgent, and the
[gendered and colonial biases of ethnography]{.underline} becoming more
apparent, the concept of distance has shifted from being viewed with
suspicion to being regarded as potentially productive within feminist
circles. It will be argued that shifts in feminist critiques of RS
involve heterogeneous theoretical traditions and forms of critical
inquiry, and that the relationship between feminist critique and RS
practices can be understood as reciprocally impactful. Through an
inquiry that integrates historical and conceptual perspectives, it will
be demonstrated that feminist critiques of RS/GIS have brought about
remarkable shifts in the evaluation of concepts of distance. A review of
these debates as a history of critical practice will address
heterogeneous positions and the theoretical backgrounds that have
inspired them, thereby not only tracing conceptual developments but also
contextualizing their genesis. The following investigation will attempt
to undermine a dichotomy between internal and external critiques of RS
and show that other heuristics focusing on tropes of distance, gaze, and
access prove to be more fruitful. Starting off with approaches which
emphasize [RS's implication in [ways of seeing]{.mark} that are
[associated with masculinist science]{.mark}, as well as a masculinist
[perspective of dominance]{.mark} and control]{.underline}, I will
discuss problematizations of such critiques advanced in the 1990s and
contrast them with other feminist positions, which focus on potentially
productive aspects of distance and usages of RS/GIS. My questions
include, how have different factors shaped and reshaped the demands for
feminist critique of GIS and RS? How do feminist approaches to these
technologies differ conceptually over time, and in what ways exactly?
And how can we grasp the shifting role of "distance" as a practical and
epistemological paradigm according to feminist approaches?

Ecofeminist criticism of remotely sensed data, and the critique of
criticisms Satellites, GIS, and masculinism

The relationship between sensing and distance is a topic that feminism
has traditionally a lot to say about. By first giving a few examples of
feminist critiques of GIS and RS in the 1990s, I will draw attention to
some of their theoretical backgrounds and borrowings in ecofeminism and
French theory. I will then turn toward problematizations of these early
feminist critiques---in a way, the critique of criticism, leading to new
engagements with RS and GIS. Feminist critiques have significantly
influenced how geographers assess the (male) gaze as a key framework for
understanding subjectivities and landscapes. In this context, the
contributions of scholars such as Gillian Rose are particularly
noteworthy (Rose, 1993, 1995). Within a field broadly concerned with
gendered forms of looking at environments through technologies, one
significant line of feminist critique has scrutinized [masculinist and
[positivist underpinnings]{.mark} as a general and indispensable part of
RS and GIS]{.underline} (Bondi and Domosh, 1992; Curry, 1995; Garb,
1990; Roberts and Schein, 1995). Roberts and Schein, for example, assert
that [through the "view [from above]{.mark}, we are
[establishing]{.mark} our own [superiority]{.mark} and our domination of
the scene"; we "[imagine ourselves]{.mark} as [separate]{.mark} from the
view, [situated]{.mark} somehow [outside the data]{.mark}, and the view
or its [contents become ours to]{.mark} control and
[manage]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Roberts and Schein, 1995: 183). The
authors call this form of gaze a ["**[proprietorial
objectivism]{.mark}**"]{.underline} and claim that "[the [satellite's
way of seeing is that of the voyeur or]{.mark} even of the
**[violator]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (Roberts and Schein, 1995: 189).
[RS, here, appears as an amalgamation of a positivist, masculinist,
**[disembodied]{.mark}**, scientistic, **[abstracted]{.mark}**, and
**[imperial project.]{.mark}**]{.underline} In such ecofeminist
criticisms of picturing the Earth through satellite visions, what is at
stake is a "totalizing" view: part of this gaze generated through Earth
imagery [involves a [relationship with]{.mark} the [Earth]{.mark} and a
[desire to gain autonomy]{.mark} and independence [from
it]{.mark}]{.underline}. Other relatable positions in the 1990s take
issue with the incapability to recognize [women's work on a domestic
scale]{.underline}, which was [not visible from the satellite's
perspective]{.underline} (Rocheleau et al., 1995). In all these aspects,
it is argued, [RS technologies as such have **masculinist**
underpinnings]{.underline}. A prime example of such a view is Yaakov
Gerome Garb's (1990) paper "Perspective or Escape? Ecofeminist Musings
on Contemporary Earth Imagery." Here, Garb negotiates an ecofeminist
perspective of whole Earth images, clearly problematizing the imagery as
a masculinist endeavor. [Placing oneself into an outside]{.underline} in
such a way would "[create not only a physical distance but a
corresponding **[psychic aloofness]{.mark}**]{.underline}," giving rise
to "[a sense of detachment and
**[spectatorship]{.mark}**]{.underline}"---a "distancing flavor" (Garb,
1990: 266--267). On various occasions, Garb refers to Susan Sontag's
writings on photography to grapple with the [**voyeuristic** nature of
"full disc" Earth images]{.underline}, ultimately remaining the ["magnum
opus of **patriarchal consciousness**]{.underline}" (Garb, 1990: 275).
In pondering whether there might not be another way of relating or
looking at these images, Garb insists that "we should check carefully
whether we really want to view our relationship with the Earth through
genderized lenses" (Garb, 1990: 277). In her paper "The Gendered Eye in
the Sky: A Feminist Perspective on Earth Observation Satellites"
published in 1997, Karen T. Litfin also questions the social,
philosophical, and gendered underpinnings of the planetary gaze (Litfin,
1997: 26). Just as Liftin notes, the "key [catalyst of the remote
sensing project" in the 1980s and 1990s were climate change
debates]{.underline} (Litfin, 1997: 28), so climate change and ecology
have remained a point of focus for critique in subsequent decades.
Ecofeminist positions have unfolded as an influential voice in these
earlier critiques. Without reducing the complexity of the ecofeminist
tradition or overlooking the impact of a generalized pushback of
ecofeminism by "third-wave feminism" (Thompson, 2006),3 what appears
crucial is a widely shared concern with [modernity's gesture of
[dividing nature from]{.mark} the [human]{.mark} sphere]{.underline},
and a [[co-emergence of the domination of nature and
women]{.underline}]{.mark} (Merchant, 1980). For this reason,
ecofeminist positions have developed a sensitivity for registering the
impact and consequences of such domination in different practices.
Ecofeminists, according to Litfin, "would claim that the global gaze, by
virtue of its position apart from and above nature, does violence to
nature" (Litfin, 1997: 39). This gaze, which intends to [maximize the
"actual and felt distance,"]{.underline} is often [connected to
masculinist]{.underline} ideas of managing a posed problem or a
[["managerial impulse."]{.underline}]{.mark} In reference to Joni
Seager, Litfin draws critical attention to "the gendered division of
labor, whereby men think about the environment and women care about it"
(Litfin, 1997: 31, 43). I will return below to this [implicit
association of labor with distance and masculinity]{.underline}, as
opposed to [[proximity and intimacy as]{.mark} ostensibly [feminine
modes of relation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although Litfin takes up
ecofeminist critiques of objectification, her position is less firm as
to how far these violent ways of looking and objectifying are
necessarily inscribed into the technology. Still, she maintains a
skepticism toward RS as a celebrated opportunity for global welfare,
with questions that seem to motivate critical approaches to RS up until
now: "Must we not be skeptical of a technology that promises so much? If
celebratory discourses serve a masking function, then what might be said
of the shadow side of remote sensing" (Litfin, 1997: 29)? Before moving
on to contestations and transformations of these feminist critiques, I
would like to briefly outline some of the theoretical background to
these early critiques of RS and GIS. Feminist critiques of RS in many
cases coincide with 20th-century French theory, often assimilated under
the label "poststructuralism" or "postmodernism." A wide range of French
thinkers and scholars, such as Gaston Bachelard, Paul Virilio, Michel de
Certeau, and Henri Lefebvre, form major touchstones in these contexts.
Themes such as the "totalizing eye" or "views from above" (Barthes,
1997; de Certeau, 1990), are widely taken up in feminist critiques of
satellite imagery, whole Earth images, as well as GIS. For example,
references such as Bachelard's notion of an image's "psychic state" has
served ecofeminist approaches to Earth imagery (Garb, 1990), while
Lefebvre's concept of the production of space has been used to criticize
GIS data (Roberts and Schein, 1995). Jacques Derrida is a further
influence when it comes to [RS's "**[hauntological]{.mark}**"
affectivity]{.underline} (McCormack, 2010). The satellite's role as a
visual regime has furthermore been considered relatable to Foucault's
analyses of the panopticon as well as with his writings on the genesis
of the gaze from the 17th century onwards (Nardon, 2007). Elwood and
Leszczynski argue that "most critical GIS origin stories" would build up
on French theory rather than acknowledging the "direct take-up of
feminist critiques of scientific objectivity and vision" (Elwood and
Leszczynski, 2018: 2). This observation can be complemented by noting
that various strands of French-language philosophy and French theory
considerably influenced feminist approaches in this context. The reason
for this is not that all of these authors explicitly bring feminist
concerns to the fore; rather, it has to be understood in connection with
the ascendancy of "French theory" in US humanities departments
especially at this time, as well as with French theorists' critical
engagement with power, space, and ways of feeling, sensing, or being
affected, which provides feminist critiques with a critical vocabulary
of viewing from above or from afar.

Derek, "Calamity Theory: Three Critiques of Existential Risk," DKP\]

The theoretical models used by existential risk analysts vacillate among
deep time speculations, unknown risk horizons, and policy making in the
present. What kind of scientific reasoning best fits these timescales
and the "unprecedented" nature of the events in question? The
*philosophers of existential risk deploy a model of probability far more
than actual calculation. But they promise that their account of
"possible" extinctions and the actions that will help humans avoid them
can and will have a quantitative foundation. Their [claim]{.mark} is
that [low probability plus extinction]{.mark}-level significance [means
we should care]{.mark} [more about ex]{.mark}istential [risks]{.mark}
than anything else*---and that this level of analysis is truly the
ultimate priority of "effective altruism." In the case of avoiding
remotely probable existential risks, the benefits and rewards are
postponed for a future distant enough that it will be hard for most to
care deeply about it, with the added complication that many of these
extinction scenarios might not be possible in the first place. It would
not be fair to say that existential risk is fundamentally incoherent
when assessing risk probability and leave it at that. But this
caricature gets at something that we will take up with more rigor in
this chapter.

The field of existential risk *[combines util]{.mark}itarianism [and
probabilistic risk analysis]{.mark} toward a fortuitous "ok" outcome*
(Bostrom's "maxipok"). On the one hand, *existential risk analysts aim
at the utilitarian goal of establishing the greatest good for the
greatest number.* On the other hand, *they [seek to use
math]{.mark}ematical probability [models]{.mark} to estimate the chance
that a given cause will lead to the extinction of humanity,* or even of
life in general.2 *The crux of existential risk analysis is the
synthesis of these two modes of calculative reasoning. But*
**[[this]{.mark} crux [is]{.mark}]{.underline}** *also* **[a
failure:]{.underline}** as we show in this section, *existential risk
analysis is constituted by a* [**[radical mismatch]{.underline}**
*between* **[method]{.underline}** *and* **[object of
study]{.underline}***.*]{.mark} *This mismatch [leads to a
]{.mark}***[[comic effect:]{.underline}]{.mark}** *the wonderfully
strange spectacle of serious philosophers (Bostrom), scientists (Sir
Martin Rees), and entrepreneurs (Elon Musk) discussing how to mitigate
the risk of deep future extinction events as though they were
calculating the probability that one will die in a car accident based on
ample statistics about the frequency of such events in the past.* The
effect is similar to that of Michael Madsen's documentary Into Eternity,
when we watch engineers become speculative philosophers as they ponder
the one hundred thousand-year time frame of their deep geological
repository for storing nuclear waste, especially when Madsen asks them
what human societies might be like in such a distant future.3 What Mark
McGurl calls "posthuman comedy" is here the effect of rational solutions
applied to cover over the unthinkable, unimaginable, and uncontrollable
otherness of any future that stretches beyond a few human generations.4

Existential risk veers from "comic" analyses of *[extremely remote
scenarios]{.mark}*, such as the "aestivation hypothesis" (aliens are
sleeping so as to wait billions of years for the universe to cool down
enough to run cosmic-size computers), to *"tragic" assessments of the
high near-term likelihood of some massive extinction-inducing event that
would be predictable but not avoidable*.5 *If we were to start
calculating the probability that a climate tipping point or AI will
bring an end to our evolutionary line, then not only would we be unable
to arrive at a reliable estimate that bears any analogy with*, for
example, *finance or insurance risk analysis, we wouldn't even know if
the event is possible in the first place. We would be trying to estimate
the probability of something that can only happen once, without any
evidence to go on.* Not only that, *we would be trying to use this
knowledge to act in a way that will prevent it from happening.* Or at
least, because existential risk analysis operates within a fundamentally
probabilistic universe, the aim is to lower the fatal event's
probability: the closer to zero, the more immune humanity's potential
will have been.

For some, this might already be enough to dismiss the idea of rational
study of remote existential risk scenarios. As one AI researcher
reports, "I don't worry about \[AI induced extinction\] for the same
reason I don't worry about overpopulation on Mars."6 There is a
common-sense idea that *we should not spend too much time or too many
resources to prevent something when we don't know if it's possible*
(though Bostrom and others would remind us that common sense is what
prevents us from seeing the implications of probability theory clearly
enough to act). As our characterization of existential risk's model of
probability and utilitarianism suggests**[, we lean toward skepticism
about the field's claim to rationality and scientific
rigor.]{.underline}** For readers steeped in critical theory, such a
quantitative approach to politics, ethics, and extinction may look to be
another chapter of the dialectic of Enlightenment, bound to end badly.
But the epistemological assumptions of existential risk should attract
greater attention and critique---not dismissal as another overreach of
rationalism, but analysis and historicization.

The Rhetoric of Probability

Writing for Vox, journalist Dylan Matthews covered the Effective
Altruism Global Conference at the Google campus in Mountain View,
California, in the summer of 2015. The title of his article---"I Spent a
Weekend at Google Talking to Nerds about Charity. I Came Away . . .
Worried"---divulges his take on the ideas and affects that circulated at
the meeting.7 "Effective altruism" is the philanthropic practice of
attempting to do the greatest good through means that are efficient and
data-driven rather than sentimental. Many in the existential risk
community also subscribe to the effective altruism movement, such as
philosopher Toby Ord, founder of the society Giving What We Can (a group
admirably committed to donating at least 10 percent of income). In
Oxford, Bostrom's Future of Humanity Institute shares office space with
the Centre for Effective Altruism. Effective altruists see themselves
embracing "the cold, hard data necessary to prove what actually does
good."8 This makes the movement a candidate for study from the
perspective of science and technology studies, as an ethical philosophy
that claims for itself scientific imprimatur. Matthews says that he
identifies as an effective altruist; he also admits that "EA is very
white, very male, and dominated by tech industry workers."9 The topic of
existential risk occupied center stage at the conference in 2015, and it
gave him pause even as someone who embraces quantitative ethics.

Matthews's skeptical account of this *["X-risk"]{.mark} takeover* is a
good example of how existential risk *[combines fantastical]{.mark},
deep-time probability [calculations with util]{.mark}itarian ethics*. In
the example he cites, *a panel featuring Bostrom and Musk, the starting
point for determining the greatest good for the greatest number of
persons was to calculate the greatest number of lives.* The presenters
did so not with respect to a narrow time frame, as in the greatest
number alive on Earth today or during a 100-year period. Instead, *they
reasoned that if humanity lasts "another 50 million years," then "the
total number of humans who will ever live is . . . 3 quadrillion."*10
*But they went on to decide that this number fails to take into account
future extraterrestrial inhabitants of the solar system, "the potential
value of our posthuman future,"* or what Phil Torres calls the
"astronomical value thesis."11 Given the same arbitrary time scale of 50
million years, they concluded that the number of people we need to take
into account is more like 1052 lives of 100 years each---*a vastly
greater number than 3 quadrillion, so much greater that the mathematical
notation for exponents seems more accessible than obscure words like
sexdecillion.*

Bostrom then shifts from such uncountable numbers to discussing the
ethical implications for us today: *"Even if we give this 1054 estimate
'a mere [1% chance]{.mark} of being correct,' . . . we [find]{.mark}
that the expected [value of reducing existential risk by]{.mark} a mere
[one billionth of one billionth]{.mark} of one percentage point is
[worth]{.mark} a [hundred billion]{.mark} times as much as a [billion
human lives]{.mark}."*12 As Matthews continues to paraphrase,

> the number of future humans who will never exist if humans go extinct
> is so great that **[reducing the risk of extinction by
> 0.00000000000000001 percent can be expected to save 100 billion more
> lives than, say, preventing the genocide of 1 billion people.
> That]{.underline}** argues, in the judgment of Bostrom and others, for
> prioritizing efforts to prevent human extinction above other
> endeavors. This is what X-risk obsessives mean when they claim ending
> world poverty would be a "rounding error."13

Since we read this article, we have mentioned Matthews's rather
satirical report to a number of friends and colleagues. Their *reaction
is always amusement at the* **[[comical absurdity]{.mark}]{.underline}**
*of this scenario.* They are right, in a sense, but in this case the
reductio ad absurdum of deep-time utilitarianism is strange because it
is also perfectly rational, if "rational" means consistent with the
concepts thinkers like Bostrom have applied. Notwithstanding their
highly speculative assumptions about the time scale of fifty million
years and interplanetary travel, the numbers reported by Matthews are
faithfully deduced by combining probability theory with the first
principle of the mathematical ethics of utilitarianism, even if *the
greatest "good" is reduced to mere existence for the greatest number.*
This is the "effective" side of effective altruism, now stretched to an
unimaginable future.

In another example, Bostrom offers a box essay in Superintelligence
about the human lives and happiness that are really at stake when it
comes to the risk of malevolent AI. Different from Matthews's example,
he adds a quantification of happiness that goes beyond the negative
value of avoiding the foreclosure of countless future lives:

> Assuming that the observable universe is void of extraterrestrial
> civilizations, then what hangs in the balance is at least
> 10,000,000,00
> 0,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 ,000
> human lives. . . . If we represent all the happiness experienced
> during one entire such life with a single teardrop of joy, then the
> happiness of these souls could fill and refill the Earth's oceans
> every second, and keep doing so for a hundred billion billion
> millennia. It is really important that we make sure these truly are
> tears of joy.14

*[This]{.mark} implied utilitarian [calculus stretches]{.mark} the
[limits]{.mark}, to put it mildly, of any known means of deciding how we
should act, what is right and wrong, and how to calculate the odds of a
given extinction.* Yet they remain calculations. They have a certain
rationality despite the absurd ambition. They also provide the
foundations for a normative prescription for action, even if it reads
slightly tongue-in-cheek given the image of an ocean filled with tears
of joy. The aspiration here is to make an ethics of extinction avoidance
rational by grounding it in the relation between probability of a given
risk and the idea that doing the right thing means dividing the total
amount of total happiness, now and in the future, by the total number of
humans. *Working with such vast numbers is what gives the idea that even
slightly lowering the probability of an extinction event is worth
"astronomically" more than any justice achieved in the present.*

Another example of Bostrom's use of probability appears in the first
chapter of Superintelligence, where he posits that AI will reach
human-level intelligence during our century. In this case, the evidence
with which to calculate such probabilities comes secondhand from surveys
of AI experts recalibrated by Bostrom. Rather than probabilities
calculated on the basis of known conditions such as the two sides of a
coin or all the data about car accidents used by insurance companies, we
have researchers guessing at probabilities, other researchers averaging
them out, and Bostrom reporting the results. So he is right to admit
that

> small sample sizes, selection biases, and---above all---the inherent
> unreliability of the subjective opinions elicited mean that one should
> not read too much into these expert surveys and interviews. They do
> not let us draw any strong conclusion. But they do hint at a weak

> extremely good outcomes and outcomes that are as bad as human
> extinction. At the very least, they suggest that the topic is worth a
> closer look.15

Bostrom rhetorically hedges several layers of uncertainty, writing not
just that we should take the numbers with a grain of salt, but that a
"weak conclusion" "suggests" that it "may be reasonable" to believe in a
"fairly sizeable" chance of the development of human level AI, "which
might perhaps fairly soon" become superintelligent, which could then
mean a "significant chance" of human extinction alongside the more
neutral and optimistic possibilities. This rhetoric of probability does
not amount to anything very different from an unguided estimate. More
generously, we can say that the changing opinions of experts allow for
guesses that are easier to trust secondhand, and that these guesses can
be updated as new evidence arrives. Yet they remain guesses about
several things that we do not know to be possible in the first place.

There would seem to be a qualitative difference between such
"probabilities" (if this is still the right term) that involve educated
guesses and secondhand surveys, and the kind of probabilistic risk
analysis that, though its conclusions remain uncertain, is able to use
data about real past events to calculate a probability. Surveying the
expert community can tell us the probability that a given expert will
believe in human extinction by AI, not the probability of the event
itself. Given Bostrom's hedging, *we are not just dealing with
uncertainty but*, what is more *abstract, rhetorical play with
uncertainty about uncertainty.* We would have to be very generous
readers to grant that there is some truth to these forecasts when the
fundamentally speculative nature of extinction scenarios, such guesswork
is understandable. **[The problem is when it is also treated as
"scientific" and "rational" grounds for political
policy]{.underline}**---even as the only grounds worth mentioning.

Stepping Back from the Precipice

A similar problem is found in Toby Ord's use of ostensibly Bayesian
probability in his recent book The Precipice. Ord's analysis draws on a
form of probability theory that, in Ian Hacking's words, "offers a way
to represent rational change in belief, in light of new evidence."16 For
Hacking, Bayesian theory matters most to "personal probability" or
"belief-type probability." It is a way of formalizing the process of
updating one's beliefs---or guesses about probability--- by learning
from experience. The basic idea is that given Pr(H1 ) as a "prior
probability," new evidence E will give a posterior probability, Pr(H1
/E). The process is iterative. The posterior probability can be fed back
into the equation as a new value for H, and evaluated again in terms of
new evidence, and so on. There are further complexities that we leave
aside. The point is that new evidence is necessary for this looping
process that offers a good way to incorporate prior beliefs---that is,
to avoid the blunt tool of an empiricism that claims to think only with
firsthand sensory evidence.

Like Bostrom, Ord is discussing the probability of AI-caused human
extinction, but in the context of a general chapter about "quantifying
risks" in the twenty-first century "risk landscape," so his statements
about method apply to the field's basic model as well. For Ord, the
greatest risk in the next hundred years comes from AI. He rates the risk
of extinction at one in ten, then notes that such a high number for such
a "speculative risk" needs more explanation:

> A common approach to estimating the chance of an unprecedented event

In an endnote to this passage, Ord goes on to explain that this approach
to probability theory is Bayesian: it entails "starting with a prior and
updating in light of the evidence," and the starting point matters.18
Like Bostrom, he bases the updating calculation on "the overall view of
the expert community that there is something like a one in two chance
that AI agents capable of outperforming humans in almost every task will
be developed in the coming century."19 Unlike Bostrom, Ord does not
include numbers from surveys or a citation, but he asks us to take his
word about the AI expert's beliefs, then to accept his leap from the
idea of human-level AI to AI as an extinction threat. While all of this
is cast in the language of Bayesian updating, the Bayesian calculations
themselves are promissory---as they must be given that we have no
evidence to fill the variable "E" and temper our initial beliefs. So
Ord's calculations are based on his own beliefs as an existential risk
theorist and on the opinions of the uncited experts; Bostrom's
calculations are based on his own beliefs and the average of a small
sample of expert opinion. Arguably these probabilities are all prior.
The authors give lip service to a Bayesianism that cannot be
operationalized by definition for an unprecedented event.20

One could imagine a situation in which these ideas were more innocently
speculative, so that the effort to treat guesswork as a foundation would
be less problematic. But the mixture of utilitarianism and the rhetoric
of probability that forms the field's basic model entails norms about
what should be done in the present to mitigate existential risks. *These
promissory probabilities and their norms don't take place in a
political-economic vacuum, isolated from practice. The Future of
Humanity Institute, The Future of Life Institute, and the Centre for the
Study of Existential Risk have received considerable funding, interest,
and participation from tech billionaires.* YouTube videos by Bostrom are
widely viewed. As their institutional and media footprints suggest,
*this field is not at all shy about capturing attention and funding*.
After offering his belief-type probabilities, Ord argues that humanity
has a 1/6 chance of extinction over the next hundred years, and lowering
this number should be "a key global priority."21 All five of the major
existential risks--- nuclear war, climate change, other environmental
damage, AI, and designed pandemics---"warrant major global efforts on
the grounds of their contribution to existential risk" (169). But the
long menu of "minor" extinction risks merits major action as well. Given
that the destruction of "humanity's entire potential" would be "so much
worse than World War II," Ord suggests that it would be justifiable to
create a global body for mitigating total existential risk by analogy
with the UN. Another possibility is to "create a body modeled on the
IPCC, but aimed at assessing existential risk as a whole."22 For
existential risk theorists, then, the policy and budgetary changes based
on their rhetoric of probability ought to be dramatic and immediate. And
when it comes to the popular nonacademic writings and declarations, the
promissory calculations recede even further into the background, from
appendices and box essays to gestures about the future of the field.
Perhaps this is where the rhetoric of probability becomes most
problematic. Given the public-facing nature of existential risk, this
problem can hardly be seen as a necessary side effect of simplifying
specialist work. Quite simply, the core practice of the field is not
calculation but commentary about future calculation with normative
weight in the present.

Radical political change is needed to ease the effects of global warming
and preserve biodiversity, even if they are not extinction risks to
humanity. *But existential risk studies take such a bird's eye view of
humanity that it is [incapable of intervening in]{.mark} a context of
austerity measures for [education]{.mark} and public services, [systemic
racism, and extreme,]{.mark} worsening class [inequality]{.mark}, among
other social problems. S*o these genuine proposals for a massive
expansion of existential risk mitigation must compete with other sorely
needed fields that are at constant risk of being defunded. *In the
university space, existential risk studies gather steam and
institutional support while austerity reigns for traditional humanities
disciplines as well as for more recent fields like critical race studies
that educate people about human histories of oppression in a time of
nationalist and white-supremacist reaction.* The coronavirus pandemic
has highlighted the racial inequality of infection and death rates just
as it has shown the need for radical change in our agro-industrial food
systems. We need research at multiple scales across the sciences and
humanities into these existentially crushing structures of oppression,
how current relations between cultures and natures became disempowering
for so many, and how both can change in the near future.

**[[Existential risk analysis is not risk
analysis.]{.underline}]{.mark}** This statement is only slightly
hyperbolic. To be fair, there are some cases where calculating rough
probabilities of planetary extinction seems possible. The frequently
cited example is asteroid strikes. But even Ord admits the *theoretical
limits inherent in calculating the probabilities of unprecedented
events*---especially the kind that, by definition, *would leave no
survivors to perform Bayesian updates.* From Bostrom and Ćirković's
early Global Catastrophic Risk to the growing archive of relevant papers
on the website of the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, our
reading suggeststhat **[there is very little actionable probabilistic
risk analysis]{.underline}** going on in this field. Perhaps this is
**[due to conceptual incoherence: the study of existential risk is
founded on an impossible data point.]{.underline}** Most of **[the
extinction events that form its core object of study are simply not
tractable in its model.]{.underline}** We can study extinction through
other methods, but *we cannot estimate the probability of* most
*extinction events*---especially the kind that matter most to these
theorists, which are the "human caused" or technological ones over which
"we" would seem to have the most agency.

**[The problem]{.underline}** *with* the lion's share of *this discourse
is* that *it gains legitimacy by offering quantification* in an academic
and corporate research world that privileges quantitative fields. **[But
what it really offers is typology, speculation akin to scenario
planning]{.underline}**, and---most important for this chapter---**[a
promissory rhetoric of probability rather than rigorous
calculations.]{.underline}** Moreover, *[valuing]{.mark} the
[future]{.mark} of humanity quantitatively is* [**[not
possible]{.underline}** *because*]{.mark} *such* **[[value is]{.mark}
relative and [qualitative]{.mark}]{.underline}***.*23 **[But this has
not in the past stopped attempts to evaluate humans quantitatively, and
this evaluative "[logic" appears incapable of extricating itself from
scientific racism,]{.mark} biopolitical management, [and
eugenics.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Bostrom himself casually examines the
application of eugenics toward creating "greater-than-currenthuman
intelligence" in Superintelligence.24 He notes that "any attempt to
initiate a classical large-scale eugenics program, however, would
confront major political and moral hurdles" (36). But this is not a
condemnation of such schemes, more an assessment of their inefficiencies
and unlikeliness to work. Bostrom does point out that state-run breeding
programs might also be used to produce docility and control, but
nevertheless concludes his brief analysis of eugenics by noting,
"Progress along the biological path is clearly feasible" (44). *If the
study and mitigation of existential risk were to become what its
practitioners envision, then it is difficult to see how these blunt
tools would avoid creating new ways of instrumentalizing lives in the
service of a future they will never see with their own eyes. The tools
of immunity have a tendency to attack what they are supposed to
protect.*

The notion of patriarchy as a socially dysfunctional system enables
feminist philosophers to show why conceptual connections are so
important and how conceptual connections are linked to the variety of
other sorts of woman-nature-peace connections. In addition, the claim
that *[patriarchy is]{.mark} a* **[[dysfunctional]{.mark} social
system]{.underline}** locates what ecofeminists see as various
\"dysfunctionalities\" of patriarchy-the empirical invisibility of what
women do, sexist-warist-naturist language, violence toward women, other
cultures, and nature-in a historical, socioeconomic, cultural, and
political context.°1 To say that patriarchy is a dysfunctional system is
to say that *[the fundamental]{.mark} beliefs, [values]{.mark},
attitudes and assumptions (conceptual framework) of patriarchy [give
rise to impaired thinking]{.mark}, behaviors, and institutions [which
are ]{.mark}***[[unhealthy for humans]{.underline}]{.mark}***,
especially women, and the planet*. The following diagram represents the
features of patriarchy as a dysfunctional social system: Patriarchy, as
an Up-Down system of power-over relationships of domination of women by
men, is conceptually grounded in a faulty patriarchal belief and value
system, (a), according to which (some) men are rational and women are
not rational, or at least not rational in the more highly valued way
(some) men are rational; reason and mind are more important than emotion
and body; that humans are justified in using female nature simply to
satisfy human consumptive needs. The discussion above of patriarchal
conceptual frame-works describes the characteristics of this faulty
belief system. *Patriarchal conceptual frameworks sanction, maintain,
and perpetuate impaired thinking*, (b): For example, *that men can
control women\'s inner lives, that it is men\'s role to determine
women\'s choices*, *that [human superiority over nature justifies human
exploitation]{.mark} of nature*, *[that women are closer to nature than
men because they are less rational]{.mark}, more emotional, and respond
in more instinctual ways than (dominant) men*. The discussions above at
(4) and (5), are examples of the linguistic and psychological forms such
impaired thinking can take. *[Operationalized]{.mark}, the evidence of
[patriarchy]{.mark} as a dysfunctional system is* **[found in the
behaviors]{.underline}** *to which it [gives rise]{.mark}*, (c), and
[*the* **[unmanageability]{.underline}**]{.mark}, (d), which results.
For example, in the United States, current estimates are that one out of
every three or four women will be raped by someone she knows; globally,
rape, sexual harassment, spouse-beating, and sado-masochistic
pornography are examples of behaviors practiced, sanctioned, or
tolerated within patriarchy. *In the realm of [environmentally
destructive behaviors]{.mark}, strip-mining, factory farming, and
pollution of the air, water, and soil [are]{.mark} instances of
behaviors maintained and* **[[sanctioned within
patriarchy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. *[They,]{.mark} too, [rest on
the]{.mark} faulty [beliefs that]{.mark}* it is okay to \"rape the
earth,\" that [*it is \"***[man\'s God-given right]{.underline}***\" to
have dominion*]{.mark} (that is, domination) over the earth, [*that
nature has only* **[instrumental value]{.underline}**]{.mark}, *that
environmental destruction is the acceptable price we pay for
\"progress.\"* And *[the presumption]{.mark} of warism*, [*that* **[war
is a natural]{.underline}**]{.mark}, righteous, and *ordinary way [to
impose dominion]{.mark} on a people or nation*, *[goes hand in hand with
patriarchy]{.mark} and leads to* **[dysfunctional
behaviors]{.underline}** *of nations and ultimately to international
unmanageability*. Much of the current \"*unmanageability*\" of
contemporary life in patriarchal societies, (d), *is then viewed as a
consequence of a patriarchal preoccupation* with activities, events, and
experiences that reflect historically male-gender- identified beliefs,
values, attitudes, and assumptions. Included among [*these* **[real-life
consequences]{.underline}** *are precisely*]{.mark} *[those concerns
with]{.mark} nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration, [war]{.mark},
[environmental destruction]{.mark}, [and violence toward women,]{.mark}
which many feminists see as* **[[the logical outgrowth of patriarchal
thinking]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In fact, it is often only through
observing these dysfunctional behaviors-the symptoms of dys-
functionality-that one can truly see that and how patriarchy serves to
maintain and perpetuate them. When patriarchy is understood as a
dysfunctional system, this \"unmanageability\" can be seen for what it
is-as a predict- able and thus logical consequence of patriarchy.\'1 The
theme that *global environmental crises, war, and violence generally are
predictable and logical consequences of sexism and patriarchal culture*
is pervasive in ecofeminist literature (see Russell 1989, 2).
Ecofeminist Charlene Spretnak, for instance, argues that \"*a
[militarism and warfare]{.mark} are continual features of a patriarchal
society because they reflect and [instill patriarchal values]{.mark} and
fulfill needs of such a system*. Acknowledging the context of
patriarchal conceptualizations that feed militarism is a first step
toward reduc- ing their impact and preserving life on Earth\" (Spretnak
1989, 54). Stated in terms of the foregoing model of patriarchy as a
dysfunctional social system, the claims by Spretnak and other feminists
take on a clearer meaning: *Patriarchal conceptual frameworks legitimate
impaired thinking* (about women, national and regional conflict, the
environment) *which is manifested in [behaviors which]{.mark}, [if
continued]{.mark}, [will make life]{.mark} on earth difficult, if not*
**[[impossible]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It is a stark message, but it is
plausible. Its plausibility lies in understanding the conceptual roots
of various woman-nature-peace connections in regional, national, and
global contexts.

[Making War Just: Gender and Legitimation]{.underline}

'[[Gender is everywhere]{.mark} in the practice of war and its
aftermath]{.underline}' (Ní Aoláin et al., 2018, p. xxxv). To illustrate
this point, consider the multiple ways that, for example[, the
[Ukraine]{.mark} war is [shaped by gender]{.mark}ed [norms]{.mark} and
ideals and [pursued by institutions]{.mark} that rely on and perpetuate
male dominated gender orders]{.underline}. [The [call to arms]{.mark} is
[legitimated by]{.mark} the idea of the [need to protect a
nation]{.mark} imagined as [female]{.mark}, [while Putin]{.mark} evinces
[a]{.mark} **hyper-[masculine persona]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Sperling,
2016). The bodies mobilised for war are male---men of fighting age are
not allowed to leave Ukraine and the Russian military relies on young,
male conscripts. Women and children, however, are allowed to flee.
Allegations of war crimes against civilians are made, including sexual
and gender-based violence against women. [When peace [talks]{.mark}
convene, the bodies around the table are [exclusively
male]{.mark}]{.underline}. [But while this is the dominant gender
narrative of this war, it is [not the only one]{.mark}. With their
mighty swords as depicted in [statues]{.mark}, 'Mother Russia' and
'Mother Ukraine' [are]{.mark} ambiguous [figures]{.mark} and there are
[women fighting and supporting the war efforts]{.mark}]{.underline}.
There are also women leading Western nation states who are now bringing
their nations into NATO in search of military security as they
understand it. What this specific example helps us to see is that the
[justification, organisation, and [practices]{.mark} of war all [rely on
gender]{.mark} and in turn [reinforce dominant way]{.mark}s [of]{.mark}
doing gender in [societies]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the same time,
however, war can be disruptive of gender orders. The following sections
will unpack these ideas in greater depth.

As we noted in Chapter Three, [seeking to [justify wars]{.mark} to their
populations, warring parties often [make recourse to gendered]{.mark}
visions [of]{.mark} the [nation]{.mark} itself [as]{.mark} a
[feminine]{.mark} construct]{.underline} (Yuval Davis, 1997) [and a
space in which innocent women and children need protected by 'their'
men]{.underline}. Cynthia Enloe famously coined the term ['womenand-
children' to capture the sense in which [women are]{.mark} effectively
[infantilised]{.mark} in such imaginings, [deprived of agency and
requir]{.mark}ing [protection]{.mark}]{.underline} (Enloe, 2014). The
[use of]{.mark} the '**[[protection myth]{.underline}]{.mark}**' and the
idea of [women as 'beautiful souls']{.underline} in need of militarised
protection is a recurrent trope in war propaganda and political speeches
(Elshtain, 1995). [[Gendered constructions of **hegemonic
masculinity**]{.mark} are [deployed]{.mark}]{.underline}, [expecting
[men]{.mark} to enlist [to]{.mark} fulfil this [protect]{.mark}or
role]{.underline}. Laura Sjoberg's work has shown the tenacity of this
['beautiful soul in need of protection' myth]{.underline}, even in
contexts where women are soldiers. Writing of the case of 'Saving
Jessica Lynch' she explains how the US military mobilised huge resources
to rescue a female soldier captured in Iraq. Rather than portray her in
the same frame as her male colleagues, Private Lynch was covered in the
US media as a white, female, pre-school teacher, threatened by the
uncivilised sexuality and violence of Iraqi male insurgents.
Intersecting ideas about race and gender were mobilised to launch a
'saving' mission (Sjoberg, 2010, pp. 59--62). [Orientalist [intersecting
ideas of race and gender]{.mark} were also central to the [**US's
self-legitimation** of]{.mark} its invasion of [Afghanistan]{.mark}
following 9/11]{.underline}. [[Legitimacy]{.mark} for the intervention
[rested]{.mark} on the idea that the '[US]{.mark} state [must
"save"]{.mark} violated [women and]{.mark} [emasculated men who
can]{.mark}no[t]{.mark} seem to [defend their countries]{.mark} from
terrorism [or build democracies]{.mark}']{.underline} (Nayak, 2006, p.
50).

[Militaries and Gender Order]{.underline}

The waging of war relies on the maintenance of armies and the training
of soldiers. [Around the world regular state militaries remain
predominantly male institutions and where women are admitted to military
life, it is often done in ways that prohibit direct combat]{.underline}
(Goldstein, 2018). [In contrast, there is greater 'gender equity' in
non-state and insurgent armed groups]{.underline} (Henshaw, 2016)---of
which more below.

Regular state militaries are male dominated spaces but men are not
'natural born killers' and militaries have to 'make' soldiers. Cynthia
Cockburn has provided impor- tant insights into this process of
becoming, which rests on [the [production of a hegemonic form of
masculinity]{.mark} involving muscular physicality, toughness of mind, a
willingness to use violence, and a [separation from]{.mark} all things
dubbed [feminine]{.mark}]{.underline} (Cock- burn, 2008). Cockburn and
other feminist analysts of military training 'boot camp' contexts have
revealed the disparagement of femininity and expectations of hetero-
sexuality that go into hazing rituals and fuel high levels of sexual
harassment and violence against women, gay, and non-binary soldiers
(Wood & Toppelberg, 2017). The production of the ultra-masculine soldier
is understood to be essential for effec- tive military action---to
ensure toughness under fire, willingness to fight, and male- bonding for
unit cohesion. In other contexts, militarised masculinity is produced as
a form of 'protest masculinity' where men cannot realise other socially
valued forms of manhood (land ownership, conventional marriage) and
express their patriarchal dominance through military means (Duriesmith,
2017).

[Critics of some of this analysis would point to the need for more
contextualised and nuanced understandings of gender construction in
fighting groups]{.underline}. The US boot camp soldier may not reflect
soldiering preparation and practices in armies used mainly for
international peacekeeping, for example (Duncanson, 2009). The greater
degree of egalitarianism in some military outfits, especially left-wing
non-state armed groups, signal that issues of ideology interacting with
gender can shape military masculinities and femininities differently
(Henshaw, 2016; Riley, 2022). Changing technologies of warfare and moves
away from physical combat might ring further future changes in gendered
militaries and the way militaries shape societies (Bayard de Volo,
2016). So, there is a need for gender analyses of militaries that are
nuanced by context, time, and place.

[That said, in the [world's]{.mark} nation state militaries, [masculine
hegemony persists]{.mark} in terms of physical bodies and expected
performance]{.underline}. [[Those who push against]{.mark} the military
gender order are [subject to suppression]{.mark}, causing sickness and
depression among soldiers who cannot conform to 'toxic
masculinity']{.underline} (Gitzen, 2021, p. 1). At the same time,
[[militaries]{.mark} as **[gender bound institutions]{.mark}** connected
to the protection of the state and its 'womenandchildren' remain part of
shaping ideas of manhood which are imbibed by boy-children the world
over from an early age]{.underline} (Bourke, 1999).

For example, MacGregor warns that the [[**securitization** of
**c**]{.mark}**limate [c]{.mark}hange** can [lead to]{.mark} a
[**"masculinization"** of **environmentalism**]{.mark}]{.underline}. If
[[c]{.mark}limate [c]{.mark}hange]{.underline} is securitized [it is
[constructed as a problem that requires]{.mark} the kinds of [solutions
that are the traditional domain of]{.mark} men and [hegemonic
masculinity]{.mark}.]{.underline} This could mean that [both **[military
responses]{.mark}** and **[exceptional measures]{.mark}** that depend on
[**downgrading of ethical concerns** would be
**justified**]{.mark}]{.underline} (MacGregor 2010). Challenging the
traditional, state-centric view of security thus seems to be an
important component of any attempts to securitize climate change in an
effort to channel more resources into political processes. Rather than
focusing on states, the more [[people-oriented approach]{.mark} of human
security seems to be a [more appropriate framework for analyzing
threats]{.mark} posed by climate change.]{.underline} The [human
security approach is particularly appealing for feminist
researchers]{.underline}, who have generally [sought to emphasize
marginal groups and give voice to the powerless]{.underline}, using
gender as an analytical tool. In fact, one can easily draw a [parallel
between the human security agenda and feminist security theory since the
works of feminist scholars]{.underline} on war; gender and security
[have contributed to the emergence of human security. **Feminist
scholars**]{.underline} writing about security have [focused on the
[security of the **individual**, rather than the
**state**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and among other things they have
contributed to the understanding of how [**[structural
violence]{.mark}** can [**threaten** the **security** of
**individuals**]{.mark} and groups]{.underline}. The concept
["structural violence", as a term to describe **social
injustice**]{.underline}, was first introduced by peace researcher Johan
Galtung, in his article Violence, Peace and Peace Research. He uses the
concept to explain how [systems created by society can
discriminate]{.underline} (often unintentionally) [against individuals
belonging to certain groups]{.underline} (Galtung 1969). Feminists have
developed [this concept to explain the [exploitation of women]{.mark}
under the patriarchal system]{.underline}, and pointed at the various
[[**dangers** posed to **certain groups**]{.mark} in society, [**even
if** national security is **not threatened**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Although feminist scholars have been very critical of the traditional
definition of security, their criticism did not reach mainstream
discourse in security studies. The emergence of the human security
agenda, however, changed this. Although the human security concept can
be traced to policy institutions like the UNDP, or individual
governments like Canada and Norway, Thórarinsdóttir (2009) points at
three ways in which feminism influenced the human security agenda.
First, the writings of feminist scholars on security issues helped to
create fertile soil for the new concept. Second, women activist
organizations had prepared the ground, by drawing attention to gender
based violence in conflicts, and third, it can be argued that the
increasing number of women in position of power, both in national
governments and within international institutions, helped pave the way
for new ideas to emerge and gain acceptance.

Gender relations, as a meta-concept, opens up interesting questions
regarding their articulation with armed conflict. We can ask how the
relation between men and women, between masculinity *and
[femininity]{.mark}*[,]{.mark} [*is shaped by*
**[militarization]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[and war]{.underline}**, and
how it bears on militarization and war. What I have heard from a wide
range of women's antiwar groups, organizations and networks from all
over the world, is that *[gender relations are]{.mark} partly
[responsible for]{.mark} our societies' [tendency to wage war]{.mark}*.
It is not just that gender relations are expressed in war. They are. And
*it is not just that they are shaped by and emerge from war in certain
forms*. That is also true. But they actually contribute to the
likelihood of war. **[[They are causal]{.underline}]{.mark}**. What you
think you can do to end war depends on what you think are the causes of
war. What is it that feminists think actually causes militarism,
militarization and armed conflict? It's very simple: feminist
antimilitarists say that *mainstream understandings of war are
deficient*. They are deficient because they lack a dimension. *They fail
to include among the systemic causes of war the patriarchal,
maledominant, sex-gender order we live in*. *The [mainstream analysis
does ]{.mark}***[[not include that perception]{.underline}]{.mark}***,
so it cannot act on it, and that makes it less effective*. How does the
mainstream peace movement conceptualize militarization and war? They see
two big power systems as causes of war: economic interests (capitalism
as a mode of production) and political systems (the ethnonational system
of states). These two power systems are large and enduring---even if
they shift and change adaptively over historical periods as they
encounter new conditions. They intersect of course: a national movement
may mobilize for an economic resource---the control of "its" own oil
reserves for instance. Western purchasers of African minerals may
exploit ethnic rivalries in the Congo. Together these twin power systems
are "the problem" that obsesses antiwar movements. What feminist
antimilitarists do is direct the antimilitarist gaze towards another
equally large, enduring, and surprisingly adaptive power system that is
inseparable from the other two. **[Economic and [political
power]{.mark}]{.underline}** *[is intertwined with]{.mark}, shapes, and
is shaped by sex-gender power, [patriarchy]{.mark}, the worldwide system
of male dominance*. *[The interests of men]{.mark} as men, patriarchal
interests*, in addition to the interests of those who own capital, in
addition to those of nationalists who profit by defining identities and
making land claims, *[get expression]{.mark} in practically every major
institution you can name*. In business corporations, states, churches,
and families, you find male power is right there functioning in,
alongside and through capitalism and nationalism. *[They are right there
in]{.mark} the institutions of [militarism]{.mark}, militarization and
war, likewise*. Capitalism, yes. Nationalism, yes. But you understand
war so much better if you take a gender lens to it. In *fact [you just
cannot understand it]{.mark} fully [without ]{.mark}***[[patriarchal
gender relations as an explanatory factor]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
*Patriarchy reproduces itself by the arrangements society makes for the
social shaping of gender---and in particular the shaping of
masculinity*. Feminists, of course, are particularly pointing to the
significance of masculinities for the survival and reproduction of the
patriarchal system, men brought up to be adequate to use power, to show
their entitlement to privilege, to manifest masculine values. *The
creation of one generation after another of [families ready to sacrifice
their sons]{.mark}*; boys addicted to computer war games like Call of
Duty; [*men ready to* **[impose their authority on women by
force]{.underline}**]{.mark}*, to identify enemies and kill
them---militarized masculinity predisposes our societies to consider war
normal*. *It [makes]{.mark} the* **[establishment of [peace very
unlikely]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Women are shaped as people ready to
play their part in a society that values the ascendancy of masculine
qualities, who do not rebel against the domestic burden, who find the
idea of male dominance erotic*. Such [gender relations]{.mark} not only*
**[fuel militarism, they [need militarization for their full
expression]{.mark}]{.underline}**. What feminist antiwar activists and
researchers are saying is that *a patriarchal gender order can be seen
as disposing a society, a community, a country to the pursuit of its
ends through armed conflict*. [*It makes* **[coercion the
normal]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[mode of procedure]{.underline}**. It
makes war forever thinkable. However, this is not an analysis you hear
promoted in the mainstream, gender-mixed, peace movements. In such
movements you can be pretty sure they are not talking about gender
relations as causal in war. Feminist antimilitarists in the peace
movement are saying: our take on war is different from the mainstream
movement. From our perspective as women we cannot help seeing militarist
thinking, militarization of societies, the training of armies and the
fighting of wars as being hugely gendered...with men and women playing
largely different roles, experiencing different kinds of effects, being
tortured in different ways, dying different kinds of deaths. They choose
sometimes to organize separately, as women, so they can highlight the
experience of women in war, and how it connects to what women experience
in everyday life in peacetime. But women organizing separately says
something else as well: it says something about the gender relations
inside mixed antiwar movements. Women tell me they organize separately
as women in part so that they can evade the perennial struggle with the
male leadership they experience in mixed organizations, to get a voice
and a hearing. They are doing it so that they can choose their own
strategies too---they may prefer something more creative than the
antagonistic confrontations with the police that some men may relish.

Understanding *the influences of [patriarchy]{.mark}* -- a system that
upholds men's power over women as well as unequal power dynamics among
men and among women -- *is critical to identifying* **[[causal
relationships]{.underline}]{.mark}** and developing solutions *to tackle
climate change*. Such analyses have already led to more sophisticated
understandings of and solutions for the fields of sexual and
reproductive health and rights, violence against women, and women's
economic empowerment, amongst other topics. This section also aims to
further strengthen the call of women's rights colleagues to integrate a
gender lens into climate change debates, which thus far have been more
focused on technical and economic arguments to underpin rationale for
action. *Since the Industrial Revolution* in the 18th and 19th
centuries, *the [progress]{.mark} of modern societies [has been
predicated on]{.mark} the need for* **[continued
[modernization]{.mark}]{.underline}** *and economic growth*. The phrase
"man versus (mother) nature" perhaps best epitomizes how *[men's
identities]{.mark} within patriarchal societies [have been based
upon]{.mark} [the need to ]{.mark}*[**[subordinate]{.underline}**
*the*]{.mark} *surrounding* **[natural
[environment]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It comes, then, as no surprise that
*ambitious [international agreements]{.mark} on limiting CO2 emissions
[are viewed as threats]{.mark} [to the current social]{.mark} and
economic [orders]{.mark}*. Recent analyses on climate skepticism,
primarily from specific corporate groups and politically conservative
groups in the global North, show how such *[actors view the
legitimization of climate change]{.mark} science [as a
]{.mark}*[**[threat]{.underline}** *to*]{.mark} *"modern industrial
rationality" and* [**[hegemonic
masculinities]{.underline}***.*]{.mark}29 In the United States and
elsewhere, the modern fields of science such as meteorology, physics and
chemistry have connections to military tradition where weapons and
technology continue to be central to victory in wartime. *The process of
militarization*, states the scholar-activist Amina Mama, *exaggerates
the bipolarization of gender identities* in extremis for the purpose of
waging war.31 This bipolarization perpetuates a system where men prove
their masculinity through performance such as military combat.32 *The
field of climate science has often been just another function of this
war machine that showed promise in allowing states to predict, control
and alter the natural world*. Most recently, resources have also been
invested into investigating how *geographic [areas]{.mark} vulnerable to
climate change [can become breeding grounds for]{.mark}* **[political
[instability and terrorism]{.mark}]{.underline}** and ways in which
military intervention can prevent violent acts from being perpetrated in
the homeland. Thus, the alliance between the military and scientific
research results in solutions more consistent with military missions
than with empowering men and women to develop sustainable strategies for
mitigation and adaptation.34

[Today\'s Western [patriarchal world view]{.mark} now
**[dominates]{.mark} globalwide [dialogue]{.mark}** []{.mark}among the
\"leaders\" of Earth\'s nearly two hundred nation-states. Its
Machiavellian/Realpolitik [assumptions about]{.mark} the **[necessity of
military power]{.mark}** to preserve order within]{.underline} and
[between groups of humans trumps\--]{.underline}and [stifles\--other
potential viewpoints. Founded on the belief that \"evil\" is innate, it
**[dictates]{.mark} that [human conflict must be
\"controlled\":]{.mark}**]{.underline} global \"law\" backed by coercive
force. [[This]{.mark} view, when cross-culturally imposed, [becomes a
**self-fulfilling prophecy**]{.mark}, thus \"[legitimating]{.mark}\" an
**[escalating]{.mark} use of [force]{.mark}**. Western
leaders]{.underline} (male and female) [use a rhetoric couched in a
\"hegemonic masculinity\" to justify their ready use of military force
to coerce \"those who are against us \" into compliance. This translates
globally as \"national leaders must never lose face!\"]{.underline}
Changing this dominant paradigm requires dismantling the hierarchic
hegemony of masculine militarism and its related economic institutions,
through global cross-cultural dialogues, thus replacing a hegemonic
world view and institutions with new, more adaptive visions, woven out
of the most useful remnants of multiple past cultural stories. The paper
concludes with a few examples where people around the world are doing
just this\--using their own small voices to insert their local \"sacred
social story \" into the global dialogue. This global process\--free
from a hegemonic militaristic rhetoric\--has the potential to initiate a
planetary dialogue where \"boundaries \" are no longer borders to be
defended, but sites of social ferment and creative adaptation. When the
call came for papers on War, Language, and Gender, referring us to Carol
Cohn\'s seminal paper \"Sex and Death in the Rational World of Defense
Intellectuals,\"(FN1) I at first felt that little more could be added on
the subject. But events in Washington in the ensuing weeks stimulated me
to a broader \"take\" on this topic[. [Defense
intellectuals]{.mark},]{.underline} after all, [[are embedded in a whole
culture]{.mark},]{.underline} and [the interaction is two-way. Not only
does their strategic framework with its euphemistic language about

think in their terms;]{.mark} their framework]{.underline} and [language
developed in response to our **deeply embedded, Western cultural image**

Isolated case studies and cross-national statistical analyses have
identified correlations between levels of inequality and propensity to
conflict or violence, but they cannot prove causality. A recent review
concludes that it remains unclear whether or how gender inequality fuels
violence (or whether gender inequality is a proxy for something else
that may cause conflict) ([Saferworld & Conciliation Resources,
2014](https://gsdrc.org/topic-guides/gender-and-conflict/relationship-between-gender-and-conflict-the-evidence/impact-of-gender-on-conflict/?utm_source=chatgpt.com#saferworld-conciliation-resources-2014)).
[[**Gender inequality** may be part of broader structural
**inequalities**]{.mark} and norms of [discrimination and violence that
contribute to **mobilising** groups and legitimizing
violence]{.mark}]{.underline} ([Caprioli,
2005](https://gsdrc.org/topic-guides/gender-and-conflict/relationship-between-gender-and-conflict-the-evidence/impact-of-gender-on-conflict/?utm_source=chatgpt.com#caprioli-2005)).
Isolated studies provide some evidence of the following:

Qualitative, cross-country research suggests that [[patriarchal gender
relations intersect with economic and ethno-national power relations,
fuelling]{.mark} a tendency toward **[armed
conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} ([Cockburn,
2010](https://gsdrc.org/topic-guides/gender-and-conflict/relationship-between-gender-and-conflict-the-evidence/impact-of-gender-on-conflict/?utm_source=chatgpt.com#cockburn-2010)).
Quantitative analysis, comparing data on micro-level gender violence and
macro-level state peacefulness, indicates a correlation between higher
levels of domestic violence and a greater chance of violent conflict.
While it has not been possible to establish a causal link, [findings
emphasize the importance of the responsibility to prevent violence
against women ([Hudson, Ballif-Spanvill, Caprioli, & Emmett,
2012](https://gsdrc.org/topic-guides/gender-and-conflict/relationship-between-gender-and-conflict-the-evidence/impact-of-gender-on-conflict/?utm_source=chatgpt.com#hudson-et-al-2012)).
**[Statistical datasets]{.mark}** also [suggest]{.mark} **[that higher
levels of gender inequality in a country correlate with increased
likelihood of intra- and inter-state conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}
([Melander,
2005](https://gsdrc.org/topic-guides/gender-and-conflict/relationship-between-gender-and-conflict-the-evidence/impact-of-gender-on-conflict/?utm_source=chatgpt.com#melander-2005)),
although this is contested by some.

Qualitative, cross-country case studies have also concluded that [gender
identities (ideal characteristics of men and women) can contribute to
the motivations which lead to war and which perpetuate violence once
started. ([El-Bushra & Sahl,
2005](https://gsdrc.org/topic-guides/gender-and-conflict/relationship-between-gender-and-conflict-the-evidence/impact-of-gender-on-conflict/?utm_source=chatgpt.com#el-bushra-sahl-2005)).
[Qualitative studies in Colombia and Guatemala (and interviews with
female combatants]{.mark} in Sri Lanka and Nepal) find that
[**domestic** and **communal** **violence** perpetrated against young
women compelled them to flee and **join gangs or
insurgencies**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Moser, 1997; Winton, 2005, cited
in [Anderlini,
2011](https://gsdrc.org/topic-guides/gender-and-conflict/relationship-between-gender-and-conflict-the-evidence/impact-of-gender-on-conflict/?utm_source=chatgpt.com#anderlini-2011)).

Caprioli's studies
([2003](https://gsdrc.org/topic-guides/gender-and-conflict/relationship-between-gender-and-conflict-the-evidence/impact-of-gender-on-conflict/?utm_source=chatgpt.com#caprioli-2003); [2005](https://gsdrc.org/topic-guides/gender-and-conflict/relationship-between-gender-and-conflict-the-evidence/impact-of-gender-on-conflict/?utm_source=chatgpt.com#caprioli-2005)),
based on theoretical inquiry and statistical analysis, argue that while
extreme and systematic gender inequality is correlated with political
violence, higher levels of gender equality (represented in this study as
lower fertility rates and higher percentage of women in the labour
force) is associated with lower risks of intra-state conflict onset. A
subsequent study by [Melander
(2005)](https://gsdrc.org/topic-guides/gender-and-conflict/relationship-between-gender-and-conflict-the-evidence/impact-of-gender-on-conflict/?utm_source=chatgpt.com#melander-2005) finds
that while female state leadership has no effect on levels of
intra-state armed conflict, the percentage of women in parliament and
the ratio of female-to-male higher educational attainment are associated
with lower levels of intra-state armed conflict. There is no clear
established causal link, however. [In general, these studies suggest
that **improvements** in gender equality and to women's security could
contribute to stability ([Anderlini,
2011](https://gsdrc.org/topic-guides/gender-and-conflict/relationship-between-gender-and-conflict-the-evidence/impact-of-gender-on-conflict/?utm_source=chatgpt.com#anderlini-2011))]{.underline}.

These findings mirror much of the [qualitative and **empirical** work on
gendered early warning indicators. This work claims that [**increases**
in gender disparity and deterioration]{.mark} in the physical security
of women are among [the **earliest signs of crisis and
violence**]{.mark}]{.underline} [(]{.mark}[Anderlini,

[[The]{.mark} three [highlighted mechanisms illustrate]{.mark} that
[gender does i]{.mark}ndeed operate as a cause in conflict
dynamics]{.underline}. It does so by lending dispositional force to
social mechanisms---here, protection, competition and mobilization. [And
it often does so in intersection with other status markers and
structures of power. [The mechanism of masculinist protection]{.mark} in
the US [emerged as gendered and racialized, the mechanism]{.mark} of
masculinist competition [added the dimension of sexuality]{.mark},
forcefully [illustrated through the case of]{.mark} conflict-related
sexual violence [in Yugoslavia]{.mark}, and the mechanism of
mobilization for survival in Cambodia operates along the axes of gender
and class, and sometimes in intersection with indigeneity.]{.underline}
Intersectional gendering does different work in these mechanisms: it
draws on racialized constructions of masculinity and femininity in the
mechanism of protection in order to authorize war[; [it
motivates]{.mark} [othering in]{.mark} dynamics of [masculine
competition]{.mark} in which [violence becomes performative of
ethnicity]{.mark} and heteronormative [masculinity]{.mark}; and it spurs
to action on the basis of gender divisions of labour and gender norms in
(Indigenous) mobilizations for survival, [triggering a backlash of
gender-based violence]{.mark}.]{.underline}

These motifs shade into outright loathing. [[War may be hell]{.mark}
indeed; [but it is driven by]{.mark} an ideology of [hatred. Misogyny is
the theory; war is the practice. Myths surrounding woman as the
enemy]{.mark} of man (and the things men do) [lay at the heart]{.mark}
of war-thought. Modern war is connotatively inseparable from the
dehumanizing representations of woman.]{.underline} The drive \"to war\"
is recessed within the myth of woman as man\'s worst enemy. [[Modern
warfare is a relentlessly Pandoran affair. Its]{.mark} abundant [coital
imagery is]{.mark} organically [inspired by its mysogynistic
cradle]{.mark}.]{.underline} Common parlance routinely asserts that an
enemy that has been consigned to ignominious defeat is an enemy that has
been \"thoroughly fucked\" (which resonates culturally as being reduced
to a woman[). It has been observed that [the construction of a]{.mark}
[soldier requires the killing of the woman
within]{.mark}]{.underline}.17 [The training of the soldier is replete
with a litany of disciplining epithets regarding the
feminine.]{.underline} The transformation from boy-recruit into
man-soldier requires the extirpation of any feminine traits and
identities; it demands the vanquishing of any lurking womanliness. War
is femicidal. [This foreshadows, moreover, the vigilance with respect to
the subversive feminine being looming within the warring
fabric.]{.underline} Soldier and policymakers guard against the
association of their actions or ideas with feminine traits[. Regardless
of its particular manifestation or definition of a practice, ritual, or
goal linked to militaries and to battle, [the ideology of war requires a
strict, unrelenting overcoming of anything understood as womanly. Its
discourse]{.mark} of identity and achievement, in other words,
repudiates and [disavows the feminine as much as it is embraces the
masculine.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In inception, monetary valuation was an approach empowered by

percolated public consciousness, aided by well-resourced [[communication
campaigns]{.mark}, the [monetary valu]{.mark}ation [of nature]{.mark} is
further [embedding patriarchal norms.]{.mark}]{.underline} In this way,
attempts to address the nature crisis by [placing a monetary value on

#### Patriarchy's pursuit of power fuels the exploitation of people, natural resources, and the environment---heightening the risk of conflict and ultimately turning the aff.

This gender differentiation in mental health is clearly reflective of
the fundamental power disparity between men and women, aggravated along
ethnic and class lines. Whichever facet of the crisis of civilization we
inspect, [women are overwhelmingly on the receiving end of the worst
impacts]{.underline}.

This suggests [that **[patriarchy]{.mark}** itself [is a function of
a]{.mark} deep-seated and self-reinforcing [psychological malaise
that]{.mark}, like a cancer, has [infected the totality of industrial
civilization]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Calls for greater gender equality to address this are all well and good.
But for the most part, the initiatives they lead to, while perhaps
well-intentioned, often fail to acknowledge the systemic roots of this
inequality in global - not just local -political, economic and cultural
structures of patriarchy.

[[Women are systematically marginalized]{.mark} from key positions of
power and decision-making processes across every spectrum of society, in
every part of the world]{.underline}, rich or poor. They are
[**[discriminated against]{.mark}**, institutionally and directly, in
politics, in employment, in the arts, in media and in
culture.]{.underline}

This is not merely to the detriment of women: the economic
marginalization of women costs the global economy trillions of dollars a
year, a massive blow to the integrity of all those structures.

Yet the vast majority of the world\'s resources are owned and controlled
by a tiny minority of the world\'s population, in the form of an
interlocking \'revolving door\' nexus of corporate, banking, government,
defense, industrial, media and other sectors.

It is that nexus, this top 90 group of transnational corporate
monoliths - including among them the world\'s most powerful oil, gas and
coal companies - that bears responsibility for two-thirds of the
human-induced greenhouse gas emissions.

And who runs those corporations? For the last decade, the number of
women on US corporate boards has remained static at around 17%. Even
where countries are doing better, it is not by much. Sweden and Finland,
for instance, are at around 27%.

Overall, decades of diversification have pretty much got us nowhere with
corporate boards being 88% white and 85% male. Looking closer at the top
Fortune 500 companies, only 4% of CEOs are women, and all of those are
white.

As these giant companies attempt to maximize their profits at any human
or environmental cost, they are exploiting intensifying resource stress
to accelerate investments in lucrative land grabs for farming, mineral
commodities, and fraudulent carbon-offset schemes.

In less developed regions like Africa, as Oxfam reports, this is
\"having an immediate impact on women\'s land-use options, on their
livelihoods, on food availability and the cost of living, and,
ultimately, on women\'s access to land for food production. These are
only the economic impacts. Women\'s knowledge, socio-cultural
relationship with the land, and stewardship of nature are also under
threat.\"

Confronting planetary misogyny

The [[systemic marginalization and repression of women is]{.mark} not an
accidental [feature of our civilizational crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}.
It is an [integral and fundamental [pillar of]{.mark} the pervasive
[injustice of the global system]{.mark}. The global epidemic of violence
toward women is inherently bound up with our [male-dominated system of
violence toward the natural world as a whole]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The rapist, the abuser, is no different from an insatiable tyrant, a
slave to his sadistic appetites, unconcerned by the pain inflicted in
the process of satiating them.

[Just as violence against women is about power, self-gratification
through dominance and control, extreme egoism and narcissism, and
ultimately a lack of empathy bordering on **psychopathology**, so
ultimately is our systemic violence against nature.]{.underline}

Throughout the course of our exploitative plundering of planetary
resources in the pursuit of endless material growth, [the [global system
continues its asymmetric war on women]{.mark}, just as it [annihilates
species]{.mark}, [destroys eco-systems]{.mark}, and [exhausts resources
for the profit and power of a tiny minority]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The gender divide is not just a mirror image of humanity\'s external
dislocation from nature: it is both a symptom and driver of that
dislocation.

But it is not working. Contemporary global capitalism might be making
some people richer, but it is making more people poorer and unhappier,
in a context of accelerating uncertainty and conflict. And by the end of
this century at least, we face the prospect, according to the consensus
of our best scientific minds, of a largely uninhabitable planet if we
continue business-as-usual.

The [[global system is failing]{.mark}, and the [mass murder, abuse and
murder of women by men]{.mark} is central to that failure: [misogyny is
an integral function of planetary destruction]{.mark}]{.underline}.

If we want to save the planet, **[[patriarchy must
die]{.underline}]{.mark}**. That means recognizing and taking
responsibility for the fact that patriarchy is integral to the
structures of power we take for granted, across East and West.

#### Patriarchy is the root cause of all conquest and violent domination as well as ecological disasters and human suffering\-\--abolishing the Patriarchy and shifting away from masculine paradigms towards more gentle and non-dominating views solves.

Technology can dominate or enhance societies. Hence, science and
technology could have developed in a different direction. However, [due
to [patriarchal values]{.mark}, which [infiltrated science]{.mark}, the
[technology it develops dominates, oppresses, exploits, and
kills]{.mark}. One reason is that [patriarchal societies identify
masculinity with **conquest**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus, [[any
technical innovation]{.mark} will [continue to be a tool for more
effective oppression and exploitation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Hence,
[[modern society seems to prioritize technology that destroys
life]{.mark}. That is [because masculine institutions and patriarchal
ideologies dominate modern societies]{.mark}]{.underline}. Their
technologies prevailed in Auschwitz, Dresden, Hiroshima, Nagasaki,
Vietnam, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, and in many other parts of the world.
[[**Patriarchal power** has brought us acid rain, global warming,
polluted waters, dictatorships, military states, poverty, and countless
cases of human **suffering**]{.underline}]{.mark}. We have seen [[men
whose power has caused them to lose all sense of reality, decency, and
imagination, and we must fear such power]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
ultimate [[result of **unchecked patriarchy** will be ecological
catastrophe and a nuclear holocaust]{.underline}]{.mark}. Such actions
are denial of wisdom. It is working against natural harmony, destroying
the basis of existence. Thus, as long as people leave questions of
technology to the "experts" the forward stampede will continue. As long
as economics focus on technology and both are the priority in politics,
we can leave none of them to experts. Ordinary people are often more
capable of taking a wider and more humanistic view than these experts.

recklessness and violence of science and technology. Charlene Spretnak
finds that the purpose of cultivating ecological wisdom is an antidote
to the free-floating anxiety modern society has created by its blind
faith in technology and progress along with militarism. Modern culture
is free-floating because it lacks grounding in the natural world; it
also lacks a sense of belonging, and healthy relationships between males
and females. [[The patriarchal goal of dominating nature and the female
has **entangled** us]{.underline}]{.mark}. We therefore need to develop
new life styles compatible with the real needs of human nature, with the
health of living nature, and with the resources of the world. Human
beings are alienated from nature; they have consequently lost their
ability to recognize measure and limitation. Nature knows when to stop.
There is a measure in all natural things regarding size, speed, and
violence. As a result, the system of nature tends to be self-balancing,
self-adjusting, and self-cleansing. That is not so with technology, nor
with the people who are dominated by technology. Here one finds no
self-limiting principles, nor any virtue of being self-adjusting.
However, in Schumacher's opinion any activity that ignores
self-limitation is of the devil. In nature and society, it acts like a
foreign body, and it causes crises. Thus, anyone who bases his or her
life on materialism, which includes permanent, limitless expansion in a
finite environment, cannot last long. (Ekins 1992; Kelly 1997; Murphy
1997; Schumacher 1993.)

#### "Trophy Hunting" marks animals as commodities, which the patriarchy reinforces as it destroys the environment.

[[Trophy hunting violates an animal's life]{.underline}]{.mark}, causing
[[pain and suffering]{.underline}]{.mark} and embedding an understanding
that the [[animals]{.mark} involved [are a
commodity]{.mark}]{.underline} to be valued solely [in terms of [the fee
that people -- usually men --]{.mark} will [pay to kill
them]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consideration of [trophy hunting is
[complicated by colonial, post-colonial, and global
inequalities]{.mark}]{.underline}: some of the [[loudest
voices]{.underline}]{.mark} against trophy hunting are people from the
global north who might be seen once again [trying to [tell
people]{.mark}]{.underline} in the global south [[how to manage
biodiversity in their own countries]{.underline}]{.mark}, while at the
same time, it is also [people from the [global north]{.mark} who are the
[primary hunters]{.mark}]{.underline}. The throughline is that trophy
hunting [[relies on norms of masculinity rooted in violence and
domination]{.underline}]{.mark}, and suppression of empathy for animals
that suffer in the process. This [[domination]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
[[by extension the form of masculinity that underpins
it]{.underline}]{.mark}, [is [celebrated in the
'trophy']{.mark}]{.underline}: in [photographs]{.underline} of the
hunter astride the animal (his weapon in hand[)]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} in [the preserved body parts]{.underline} that are
subsequently displayed in the hunter's home.

#### Patriarchal approaches and thinking historically undermine environmental conservation and crises.

Current [[approaches to the natur]{.mark}al crisis]{.underline} [[are
not adequate to the]{.mark} scale of [challenge]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
this perspective piece, we highlight some of the many ways in which
[[patriarchal thinking]{.underline}]{.mark} has helped to create and is
now exacerbating this situation. We have argued that such thinking [has
three effects]{.underline}: first, [patriarchal
[norms]{.mark}]{.underline} often [[compromise the]{.mark} short-term
[effectiveness]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} specific
[[conservation programs]{.underline}]{.mark}; second, at a more systemic
level, [rehearsing and [further embedding patriarchal values and
norms]{.mark}]{.underline}, will serve to further [[postpone]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} transformative [changes necessary]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} adequately [[address the nature
crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}; third, where [patriarchal [norms become
embedded in conservation]{.mark}]{.underline} practice, this can further
[[reinforce and perpetuate existing marginalization of minoritized
groups]{.underline}.]{.mark}

#### Masculine and patriarchal norms are guards for dissent against traditional views -- only the alt can solve.

Yet [[conservation]{.mark} practitioners]{.underline} often [feel
una[ble to dissent from these frameworks and the patriarchal mindsets
that underlie them]{.mark}]{.underline}, for [fear]{.underline} of
the[ir [work being seen as lacking political and economic
realism,]{.mark}]{.underline} thus risking them [[becoming sidelined or
censured]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Patriarchal [norms]{.mark} thus op[erate
as a defensive cordon]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} safeguarding the
monetization of nature from critical examination. [[Dissent]{.mark} is
[dismissed as 'emotional']{.mark}]{.underline} (cf. Science and

### 2NC\-\--Root Cause\-\--Climate Change

#### Patriarchal masculinity is a structural driver of climate change

**Wallace et. al '16**. \[a global expert on gender equality,
masculinities, sexuality education, sexual and reproductive health
rights and services, the prevention of violence against women and
children, and men's engagement in women's economic empowerment and equal
care work.\]"Men, Masculinities & Climate Change: A Discussion Paper".
<https://www.equimundo.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Men-Masculinities-Climate-Change.pdf>.
\[Pg 7} //KKang

[[Reluctance to address the **gendered root causes of climate
change**]{.mark} also [impacts the extent to which]{.mark} [countries
invest]{.mark} financially in solutions.]{.underline} Just three percent
of aid to address climate change has targeted gender equality as a
primary objective, while 26 percent of aid targeted gender equality as a
secondary objective.46 Such aid is primarily aimed at women and girls
without a deeper understanding of the relational nature of gender.
[[Critics]{.mark} from environmental organizations also [see the]{.mark}
international development field's instrumentalist [use of women]{.mark}
and girls [as a way to further enhance econ]{.mark}omic [growth]{.mark}
and profit. Such [approaches often see women]{.mark} and girls [as
independent actors who can "save"]{.mark} [their communities]{.mark} if
they are the target of investment, [while not changing]{.mark} the
[underlying]{.mark} economic and [political systems that produce]{.mark}
gender [inequality]{.mark} and poverty.]{.underline}

Given the urgency of climate change and its immediate impacts already
being felt around the globe, [activists are now sounding the call for
mass intersectional social movements that challenge dominant economic,
political and social systems perpetuating climate chang]{.underline}e.48
Such movements would seek to achieve "climate justice" --
reconstructions of the ways in which we consume, work, and live our
lives.49 It is argued that focusing on the deconstruction and
transformation of masculinities and other gender identities will
strengthen future and existing solutions for climate change adaptation
and resiliency.

[[**Patriarchy is harmful to our climate**. Efforts are needed to
advance this perspective]{.mark} by engaging men as human beings who are
also vulnerable to disasters brought on by climate change and as actors
with agency to enact change alongside women activist allies. [The
challenge lies]{.mark} in having boys and men engage in this process as
[a transformative]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[step that leads away from rigid ideas of masculinity too often based
on conquest, control and]{.mark} [domination]{.mark}. Indeed, experts
[have highlighted the need to]{.mark} better [understand how]{.mark}
harmful ideals of [masculinity]{.mark} that [include the need to have
power over]{.mark} others -- '[others']{.mark} being understood as
[women]{.mark}, other men, children [and nature50-- perpetuate
environmental degradation]{.mark}.]{.underline} A gender-equitable
response to climate change must not only be sensitive to gender
differences in roles and needs, but must also address social and
economic power imbalances between and among women and men.

However, it must be noted that carrying out a gender sensitive analysis
and engagement on climate change and masculinities is not a magical
silver bullet. It is not the key piece to shift action on climate
change. A major challenge of climate change is, in fact, that there are
no easy single-step solutions. [Working with men and women on gender
transformative approaches to responding to climate change is, therefore,
not presented here as the only answer, but a valuable opportunity to
synchronize different voices towards the shared concern of addressing
harmful climate change.]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--AT: Essentialism

**We don't essentialize, but discussions of gender are paramount driving
forces in society**

[[Against]{.mark} [essentialist arguments]{.mark} that [see inequality
between women and men as causing violence and]{.mark} [war, and equality
as productive]{.mark} of peace, post-positivist feminists have more
often treated war and gender as co-constituted. [Gender]{.mark} does not
cause war, but it [inhabits war]{.mark}. [Gender is a pervasive]{.mark}
[force, a power relation that defines identities, informs symbolic
orders and directs material processes]{.mark}]{.underline} (Cockburn
2010; Cohn 2012, 3--5; Sjoberg 2013, 2009).[Gender [relations
are]{.mark} imbricated [in processes of]{.mark} [militarization]{.mark},
and [war]{.mark} [reproduces binary gender constructions, militarist
masculinities]{.mark}, and corresponding femininities]{.underline}
(Crane-Seeber 2016; Joachim and Schneiker 2012).Researchers employing
these types of arguments tend to generalize, not by establishing laws,
but by identifying social mechanisms that give force to gendered
processes[. [Two]{.mark} examples of such mechanisms [are]{.mark} first,
the "logic of [masculinist protection]{.mark}" (Young 2003), which calls
on men to defend]{.underline} women and the homeland, making it possible
to think of war as an honorable activity in which to engage; [and
second, the militarization of masculinities, typically
associated]{.underline} with a denigration of women and everything
considered [feminine in order to encourage male war fighting. This
disparagement of women is most virulently]{.underline} expressed in
sexual violence. As men are being trained for war and societies are
being militarized, [violence against women becomes part of the fabric of
everyday lives]{.underline} (Detraz 2012; Duncanson 2009; Whitworth
2007;Goldstein 2003).

### 2NC\-\--AT: Extinction Outweighs

#### [Discourses]{.underline} of extinction seek to [preserve]{.underline} heteronormative policy [frameworks]{.underline} through frames of [extinction]{.underline} and [conservation]{.underline}

akshaj\]

[The reproduction of survival/ the **[survival of
reproduction]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[Extinction]{.underline} is almost always [[understood]{.mark} against
the horizon of survival and the [**imperative** to sustain]{.mark}
it]{.underline} -- at least for [life forms deemed to be of value to
[humans]{.mark}]{.underline}. In many cases, this imperative takes the
form of [deliberate [strategies for]{.mark} enforcing
**[existence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Donna Haraway's influential book
When Species Meet devotes considerable attention to the logics,
practices and politics of Species Survival Plans. These [plans monitor
and [**enforce** reproduction amongst]{.mark} '[**endangered**'
species]{.mark}]{.underline}, not least by collecting data on
populations, genetic profiles and [genetic materials to enable selective
breeding]{.underline}. This strategy assumes that all
[[organisms]{.underline}]{.mark} can, should, and [can be made to
[exercise]{.mark} their reproductive **[capacities]{.mark}** in order
[to resist extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}, and it actively mobilizes
members of 'endangered species' into this project. In so doing, it helps
to [entrench norms regarding gender, sexuality and reproductive labour
that are deeply [entrenched in modern, Western **human
cultures**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Attention to these programmes
highlights an important way in which [[extinction]{.mark} is
[gendered]{.mark} in **[dominant]{.mark}** scientific and **[policy
frameworks]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Specifically, strategic breeding
programmes share in the belief that [reproduction is an [imperative
for]{.mark} those capable of reproducing if 'the [species]{.mark}' is
[at risk]{.mark}']{.underline}. This belief is directly related to
[Western norms]{.underline} of the [reproductive imperative for
women]{.underline}. Indeed, Haraway points out that it is precisely
["'[woman]{.mark}'s' putative self-defining responsibility to 'the
species' as this singular and typological female is [reduced to]{.mark}
her **[reproductive function]{.mark}**"]{.underline}. In a similar
sense, within SSPs and other strategies of enforced survival, entire
life forms are reduced to their reproductive capacities. Moreover,
programmes of enforced survival can, in the context of [sexual
reproduction]{.underline}, disproportionately [[burden female]{.mark}
organisms with the [task of avoiding]{.mark}
[extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}. This [[logic]{.mark} is particularly
[fraught in]{.mark} discussions of the [**possibility** of human
extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}, in which female fertility (captured in
the standard policy language of 'births per woman') is [framed
simultaneously as a threat to [survival]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the
[[only hope]{.mark} for escaping extinction]{.underline} (see, for
instance, Alan Weisman's comments on this). In these ways, the
[[securitization of]{.mark} survival entrenches the [**intersectional**
categories of gender]{.mark}]{.underline}, [species and race discussed
above]{.underline}. [[Dominant discourses of extinction and
conservation]{.mark} also [entrench]{.mark} and privilege sexual
[reproduction]{.mark}]{.underline}, in ways that [entrench
heteronormative assumptions and norms]{.underline}. This is reflected in
the way that the [subjects of [extinction and conservation]{.mark} are
**[framed]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The standard object of conservation is
the biological 'species', a term which is defined by the ability of
[organisms to reproduce sexually]{.underline}. As Myra Hird has pointed
out, this conception of 'species' makes it appear as if [sexual
reproduction]{.underline} is the ['[best' means of sustaining]{.mark}
the [existence]{.mark} of a life form]{.underline}. However, Hird's work
demonstrates that Earthly life forms actually engage in myriad forms of
reproduction, from the free exchange of DNA between bacteria to the
hermaphroditic practices of some fish. The upshot of these arguments is
that [Earthly life]{.underline} is [sustained]{.underline} through a
[huge variety of reproductive activities]{.underline} that do not
conform to bi[ological understandings of life processes or
species]{.underline}. Crucially, Hird argues that there is no necessary
hierarchy between forms of reproduction. In Darwinian terms, [all
species]{.underline} that manage to [survive are equally
successful]{.underline}. However, by [[**conflating** survival with
sexual reproduction]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[existing discourses of
extinction]{.underline}]{.mark} embed [[**hetero-normative**
frameworks]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[devalue other forms]{.mark} of
reproduction]{.underline}. They also [reduce reproduction to the
imperative to survive]{.underline}, [**[ignoring]{.mark}** the myriad
[cultural]{.mark}, [political]{.mark}, [aesthetic]{.mark},
[sensual]{.mark} and other dimensions of
[reproduction]{.mark}]{.underline}.

## Alt

### Alt Solves/Key\-\--Generic

#### The alt is key -- current feminist networking systems have failed to replace patriarchal norms and remain empty promises to solve issues that grow worse every day.

Joanna **Hoare** **10** (Hoare is a research analyst in gender and
international development; Feb 25, 2010, "Gender Violence in Russia: The
Politics of Feminist Intervention,"

The new global feminist consensus on violence against women suggests
three general objectives for intervention upon which to assess
interventions' success. On the first objective, the mobilization of
local activism, [the [Russian case shows]{.mark} the]{.underline}
weakness of the [[least intrusive form of intervention, transnational
feminist networking]{.underline}]{.mark}. Despite activists' hopes and
scholars' assertions, the impact of this new form of more egalitarian
transnational organizing was [[mostly symbolic]{.underline}]{.mark}. As
in most countries where resources for broad-based progressive social
organizing are scarce, transnational networking among feminists reached
Russian feminists only in global cities such as Moscow and St.
Petersburg. With only small grants, these [local [activists could
appropriate]{.mark} the [international model]{.mark}]{.underline}, the
women's crisis center in which volunteers staff a crisis hotline, [but
they could ne[ither create a broader movement nor become successful
advocates for]{.mark} societal or [policy change]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Similarly, such [[minimally intrusive interventions]{.mark} are likely
to [have little impact on]{.mark} the second and third [indicators of
intervention success,]{.mark} raising [awareness and]{.mark} increasing
[state responsiveness]{.mark} in policy and practice]{.underline} (see
table 7.1). In the intervention on the issue of sexual assault in
Russia, [transnational [feminists' joining forces with human rights
advocates to try to enforce new global norms led to virtually no
changes]{.mark}]{.underline}: no measurable shift in the awareness of
sexual assault as a violation of women's rights and no state reform.
[Although the [Russian government now acknowledges violence against
women]{.mark}]{.underline} in its reports for various international
women's rights processes, such as CEDAW, the [[commitments remain empty
promises without]{.mark} the imposition of [additional
incentives]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The "Helsinki effect"---the impact of
the acceptance of human rights norms by legitimacy-seeking repressive
states (Thomas 2001)---was minuscule]{.underline}, if anything. For
those concerned about re-enacting imperialism---who therefore shun more
invasive interventions---the results are frustrating. [In countries such
as Russia, [minimally intrusive interventions are not sufficient to
foster the realization of new global
norms]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

### Alt\-\--Empathetic Cooperation

#### The alternative is [empathetic cooperation]{.underline}\-\--empathy enables us to [enter]{.underline} different worlds and [place ourselves]{.underline} in them in a [subjectivity-moving way.]{.underline}

[I offer [empathetic cooperation as a navigational method]{.mark} for
politics at borderlands. [Empathy taps the ability and willingness to
enter into the feeling]{.mark} or spirit [of something and appreciate it
fully in a subjectivity-moving way.]{.mark} It is to take on board the
struggles of others by listening to what they have to say in a
conversational style that does not push, direct, or break through to "a
linear progression which gives the comforting illusion that one knows
where one goes"]{.underline} (Trinh, 1989:1).9 [[It is an ability and
willingness to investigate questions of "women"]{.underline}]{.mark}
(and other misdeeds in IR) [[in ways that open us up to the stories,
identities, and sites that have been by-passed in "our" field.]{.mark}
Along the way, our subjectivities travel to accommodate the new
empathies.]{.underline} That is, they shift ranks or parameters of
meaning as we listen. We then cooperate when we "negotiate respectfully
with contentious others" (Ferguson, 1993:154) around the mobilities that
empathy has revealed. Put differently, we jointly probe meaning and
action in the face of homelessness within canons that have themselves
been made to slip their moorings through empathetic readings, modes of
listening, and ways of sighting. [Together, [empathy and cooperation
enable "different 'worlds' and ourselves within
them"]{.mark}]{.underline} (Lugones, 1990:396), [as we engage in
politically difficult negotiations at borderlands of knowledge,
experience, differences, and subjectivities.]{.underline}

Interestingly, Ferguson (1993:33) explicitly rejects the idea that
feminist standpoint and postmodernist differences can travel together
via empathy. Following Donna Haraway (1989), she argues that approaches
to reconciliation that rest on appeals to empathy can go astray:
"empathy can readily be recruited into a gesture of appropriation (as in
'I know just what you mean' when I really don't know at all)." I
sympathize with Ferguson's concerns, but that is precisely the point:
["I"ness is a sign of sympathy and not empathy. Sympathy is a
self-centered sentiment that allows for little if any slippage,
mobility, and hyphenation of subjectivity and identity on the occasion
of listening to someone else's tales.]{.underline} Says Butler
(1993:118), "sympathy involves a substitution of oneself for another
that may well be a colonization of the other's position as one's own."
[Empathy is something rather different. [If one "hears" the different
voices of IR empathetically]{.mark}, because one's own identities are
less fixed than one thinks and [because one is listening respectfully
with many ears, new]{.mark} field-multiplying [identities]{.mark}
[become possible in the face of shared alienations from master
texts]{.mark}]{.underline} (and the homeless wanderings they impose on
"women"). [This alienation renders a cooperative negotiation of
knowledge both necessary and desirable as many subjectivities, in
effect, interparticulate.]{.underline}

### Alt\-\--Standpoint epistemology 

#### [Standpoint epistemology]{.underline} serves as an analog to [deinstitutionalize]{.underline} the influences of [power relations]{.underline} transforming [social identity]{.underline} into a [non-epistemic]{.underline} factor 

**Toole '22** \[Briana; 3/1/2022; Associate Professor in the Department
of Philosophy at Claremont McKenna College, Ph.D in philosophy from
University of Texas at Austin; Demarginalizing Standpoint Epistemology,
p. 47-49; akshaj\]

Where early feminist scholars conceived of [[standpoint
epistemology]{.mark} as [a gendered analog]{.mark} to **Marx\'s
analysis** [of]{.mark} the proletarian [standpoint]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Hartsock Reference Hartsock, Harding and Hintikka1983; Harding
Reference Harding1991, Reference Harding2004), later standpoint
epistemologists expanded the scope of their analyses. Rather than
examining the role of gender in the acquisition of knowledge, [they
[instead evaluate]{.mark}d [the extent]{.mark} to which [**unequal**
power relations]{.mark} might [structure]{.mark} inquiry or influence
the **[production of knowledge]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Collins Reference
Collins1990; Crasnow Reference Crasnow2009; Rolin Reference Rolin2009).
Such analyses thus allowed [standpoint epistemologists to consider a
wide range of potential [influences]{.mark} on knowledge -- [from class
and gender to race and sexuality]{.mark}]{.underline}. Still other
feminist epistemologists (in particular, feminist empiricists)
investigated the influence of gendered (or racialized) norms,
expectations, and experiences on the production of knowledge,
particularly in scientific inquiry (Longino Reference Longino1990;
Anderson Reference Anderson1995; Kukla and Ruetsche Reference Kukla and
Ruetsche2002; Rolin Reference Rolin2016).

Despite the richness and value of the standpoint literature, there is a
worry, as Kristen Intemann notes, that standpoint epistemology has been
interpreted in ways that make it 'either obviously false or trivially
true', or in ways that make it 'more plausible, but fairly trivial'
(Intemann Reference Intemann2010: 783--4). My first goal here is to give
a specific interpretation of standpoint epistemology that is neither
obvious nor trivial.

Moreover, some worry that there is a tension between "traditional"
epistemology, and standpoint epistemology. Elizabeth Anderson, for
instance, writes 'Traditional epistemology finds \[the\] claims of
feminist epistemology to be highly disturbing, if not plainly absurd'
(Anderson Reference Anderson1995: 51). Marianne Janack notes this
tension, as well, writing, 'Feminist claims ... are often met by
incredulity on the part of traditional epistemologists' (Janack
Reference Janack1997: 127).

The source of this tension is up for debate, with some attributing it to
the presumed incompatibility between standpoint epistemology and
objective inquiry (Harding Reference Harding1991: esp. Ch. 6; Antony
Reference Antony, Goodin and Tilly2006; Kukla Reference Kukla2006), and
others locating the tension in the differing conceptions of epistemic
agency adopted by each school of thought (Nelson Reference Nelson1990,
Reference Nelson, Alcoff and Potter1993; Grasswick Reference
Grasswick2004).Footnote 2 My second goal here is to propose an
alternative explanation as to what this tension consists in. I do so by
identifying one plausible characterization of traditional epistemology
according to which it does stand in a clear tension with standpoint
epistemology. This characterization is of traditional epistemology as a
form of intellectualism (to use a technical label Jason Stanley has
recently popularized). I then investigate the conflict between
standpoint epistemology and intellectualism.

Intellectualism is the thesis that knowledge does not depend on
non-epistemic features (Stanley Reference Stanley2005: 6). My [proposed
interpretation of [standpoint epistemology]{.mark} will be as a form of
the [view that knowledge is **sensitive**]{.mark} to non-epistemic
features]{.underline}. It is in this sense that the standpoint thesis is
in tension with traditional epistemology, and intellectualism more
specifically. [[Standpoint epistemology]{.mark} thus [belongs to]{.mark}
a [family]{.mark} of views [that **denies**]{.mark} the thesis
of]{.underline} intellectualism, including some forms of epistemic
relativism (Neta Reference Neta2007; MacFarlane Reference MacFarlane,
Bernecker and Pritchard2011), as well as [[pragmatic
encroachment]{.underline}]{.mark} (Hawthorne Reference Hawthorne2004;
Stanley Reference Stanley2005).

As I will interpret it, [standpoint epistemology [takes an epistemic
agent\'s **social identity** to be a non-epistemic factor]{.mark} that
makes a difference to what she is in a position to know]{.underline}.
The standpoint thesis, as I have articulated it here, features a number
of technical terms that, before I proceed, need to be defined. I define
[an [epistemic agent as any person who]{.mark} [has the capacity to
**acquire knowledge** and to **share knowledge**]{.mark} with
others]{.underline}.Footnote 3 [The [distinction]{.mark} between
epistemic and non-epistemic features has been [used to frame the
debate]{.mark}]{.underline} between intellectualists and their opponents
such as Hawthorne (Reference Hawthorne2004), Stanley (Reference
Stanley2005), Fantl and McGrath (Reference Fantl and McGrath2009), and
so on. Neither these authors nor I have a precise definition of when a
feature is epistemic.Footnote 4 However, paradigm examples give us a
strong grasp on the category of epistemic factors: the examples are
evidence and justification, truth, belief, reliability -- in short,
those properties that featured in the post-Gettier trend that
characterizes traditional epistemology.

#### Only [Standpoint Epistemology]{.underline} solves the [links]{.underline} through going beneath [dominant ideology]{.underline} to expose the [underlying system]{.underline} and provide [empowerment]{.underline}

In her chapter \"The Feminist Standpoint: Developing the Ground for a
Specifically Feminist Historical Materialism,\" Nancy Hartsock uses
[Marxist [epistemology]{.mark} to [develop]{.mark} a specifically
feminist historical materialism-a [methodology that]{.mark} [analyzes
all **dimensions** of social life in terms of the development]{.mark} of
those material goods [necessary to]{.mark} sustain [human
existence]{.mark}]{.underline}. What most impresses Hartsock concerning
Marx is his interpretation of the world from the standpoint of the
proletariat. Because Marx used the eyes of the workers, says Hartsock,
he was able \"to go beneath bourgeois ideology,\" to see capitalism for
what it is-an exploitative system that permits and even requires people
to be alienated from each other and from the natural world. Hartsock
extends Marx\'s insight, arguing that if feminist philosophers wish
[\"[to go beneath\" **patriarchal ideology**]{.mark}, they [must]{.mark}
[use]{.mark} the [eyes of women to expose patriarchy]{.mark} for what it
is-an [oppressive system that]{.mark} permits and even [**requires** men
to dominate women]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Hartsock suggests that to ask Marx why the perspective of the workers
should be privileged over that of the capitalists or to ask feminist
theorists why the perspective of women should be privileged over that of
men is to invite the following clarification: Not all standpoints on
reality mirror it with equal accuracy. Because the rich and the power-
ful are often able to make the world conform to their image and likeness
of it-usually by forcing the poor and the vulnerable to see things their
way-the capitalists\' under- standing of reality tends to be more
\"partial and perverse\" than that of the workers. Although [it is no
easy task for the [workers]{.mark} to see things as they really are,
they [have the potential not only to see the world as it truly is but
also to change it for the better]{.mark} precisely [because of their
**oppressed status**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In response to the argument that women are too different from each other
to share any common \"historical materialist\" experience, Hartsock
insists that [[no matter what their age, race, socioeconomic class, or
religion]{.mark}, all women do \"women\'s work\": \"Whether or not all
of us do both, [women as a sex are **institutionally** responsible for
**producing** both goods and human beings and all women are forced to
become the kinds of people who can do both]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}
Therefore, it is women\'s work that constitutes the standpoint from
which a// women can and should interpret reality as it is and as it
could be. [[Only by understanding]{.mark} the [**liberatory** as well
as]{.mark} the **[exploitative dimensions]{.mark}** of their
[work]{.mark} will [women gain enough revolutionary momentum]{.mark} as
well as visionary clarity [to overcome]{.mark}]{.underline} what
Hartsock views as the [destructive tendencies of a [patriarchal
system]{.mark} that trivializes women\'s life-giving work even as it
feeds off of it.]{.underline}

#### The alt solves\-\--recognizing social situatedness beyond creating IR scholarship 

**Penttinen '13** \[Elina; 03/11/2013; University Lecturer in
International Relations at the University of Tampere, Finland; Joy and
International Relations: A New Methodology, P. 67-68; akshaj\]

I find it peculiar that [the [foundational question of IR has been
**war**]{.mark} and what little attention we pay to the wars we wage
against each other within the discipline]{.underline}. [We look at the
human weaknesses and confusion out there in the world and see how
attachment to unquestioned beliefs may lead to fullblown
violence]{.underline}2 (see, e.g., Kaldor 2006; Butalia 2000; Malesević
2008). Yet we [[**refrain** from questioning our]{.mark} own [beliefs
and confusions]{.mark}, which reinforce our experience of academic
scholarship as a realm of struggle and competition between different
approaches]{.underline}.

[[Following]{.mark} the linguistic turn, **[feminist
epistemologies]{.mark}**, postcolonialism and poststructuralism, there
[has]{.mark} [been a call to recognize the **social situatedness** of
researchers]{.mark}]{.underline}. [We are called to [recognize]{.mark}
how [our own]{.mark} [gender, ethnicity, culture and class
background]{.mark} play a [**part** in the research process]{.mark} with
respect to the world we study]{.underline}. [Yet I want to move a step
further and address why it is relevant that we also question the beliefs
we have about academic practice in general or the way we engage in the
practice of IR]{.underline}.

Because we see wars in distant places as not worth all the casualties,
perhaps we can turn the attention back to academic scholarship of IR and
begin to acknowledge the number of casualties we create, the suffering
we inflict in the internal wars of the discipline.

My aim in this chapter is to show that [we can [move beyond **creating**
IR as a scholarship]{.mark} that is [bound]{.mark} [by]{.mark} and to
the [ontology of suffering and problem]{.mark}- making in its approach
to outside reality as well as reality within the academic
discipline]{.underline}. In the previous chapter I discussed the
relevance of positive emotions in increasing creativity and novel
insight. In this chapter I will address how training the mind through
the practice of mindfulness can enhance research practice as well as
scholarly communication in IR.

[[Mindfulness brings]{.mark} with it the **[philosophical
conceptualization]{.mark}** of knowing and being as an [embodied]{.mark}
[intra-activity]{.mark} with the world in its continuous
unfolding]{.underline}. [Therefore I want to turn the spotlight onto how
the thinking mind (conceptual mind) works and how it can be
trained]{.underline}. [This is [necessary as we]{.mark} [place so much
faith in the conceptual mind and analytic thinking in **creating**
knowledge in]{.mark} the field of [IR]{.mark} and often forget how our
body is always present and active [in]{.mark} the process of writing and
creating **[academic scholarship]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### While there can be multiple standpoints within the spectrum of femininity, only using a woman's standpoint as a starting place can solve the K.

universities of Cambridge and Auckland, respectively, "Feminist
Standpoint Theory", https://iep.utm.edu/fem-stan/\]

The concept of a standpoint employed in feminist standpoint theories
takes a narrow meaning, owed to Marxist theory, according to which a
standpoint is an achieved collective identity or consciousness. [[The
establishment of a standpoint]{.mark} is the political achievement of
those whose social location forms its starting point; it is not merely
ascribed from beyond that location]{.underline}. There is a consensus
among feminist standpoint theorists that a standpoint is not merely a
perspective that is occupied simply by dint of being a woman. Whereas a
perspective is occupied as a matter of the fact of one's
socio-historical position and may well provide the starting point for
the emergence of a standpoint, a standpoint is earned through the
experience of collective political struggle, a struggle that requires,
as Nancy Hartsock puts it, both science and politics \[Harding 2004: p.
8\]. [By way of emphasis of this point, Hartsock uses the label
'feminist standpoint' whereas Dorothy Smith uses the label 'women's
standpoint', reflecting the way in which standpoint theory [argues for
"women's place" as a starting point for enquiry]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[Harding 2004: 21\].

So [while [both the dominant and the dominated occupy
perspectives]{.mark}, the dominated are much more successfully placed to
achieve a standpoint]{.underline}. Nevertheless, [[it is not impossible
for those who occupy non-marginalized perspectives to become part of the
process]{.mark} of helping reach a shared critical consciousness with
respect to the effects of power structures on epistemic
production]{.underline}. There are many different lives consisting of
many different activities and many different social relations and, thus,
potentially many different consciousnesses and many different
standpoints. [The ongoing political and epistemic project of achieving a
standpoint offers critical insights that give rise to a new perspective
on reality]{.underline}. Sandra Harding explains the point thus,

Only through such struggles can we begin to see beneath the appearances
created by an unjust social order to the reality of how this social
order is in fact constructed and maintained. [This need for struggle
emphasizes the fact that [a feminist standpoint is not something that
anyone can have]{.mark} simply by claiming it]{.underline}. [[It is an
achievement]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[A standpoint differs in this respect
from a perspective]{.mark}, which anyone can have simply by 'opening
one's eyes']{.underline}. \[1991:  127\]

#### Standpoint epistemology facilitates the emergence of power of marginalized groups through self-assertion.

**Bowell '15** \[Tracy Bowell, 2015, I am currently Pro Vice-Chancellor
Teaching and Learning, a role that I have held for the past 7 years.
Prior to this, I was a Senior Lecturer in Philosophy and Associate Dean
Academic in the (then) Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences. I completed
my BA (Hons) at the University of Sussex and my MPhil and PhD at the
universities of Cambridge and Auckland, respectively, "Feminist
Standpoint Theory", https://iep.utm.edu/fem-stan/\]

According to feminist standpoint theories, [[the process of achieving
knowledge begins when standpoints begin to emerge]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[They emerge [when those who are marginalized]{.mark} and relatively
invisible from the vantage point of the epistemically privileged [become
conscious of their social situation with respect to socio-political
power and oppression, and begin to find a voice]{.mark}]{.underline}. It
is no historical accident that feminist standpoint theory emerged in
academic discourses more or less contemporaneously with the feminist
consciousness movement within feminist activism. This demonstrates the
way in which [feminist standpoint theories are grounded in feminist
political practice]{.underline}. [Contrary to the tendency of critics
who perceive feminist standpoint theory via an individualist lens,
mistakenly reducing the notion of a standpoint to an individual's social
location, [the emergence of standpoints is a collective process
occurring through the recognition and acknowledgment of others who
occupy more or less the same standpoint as oneself]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Although such narratives may form a starting point, the emergence of a
standpoint does not consist merely in the telling of individual women's
narratives. [[Self-definition in terms of a standpoint provides a
starting point for the self-assertion of one's own identity]{.mark},
challenging those identities imposed by conventional stereotypes that
form part of hegemonic ways of thinking from the point of view of the
socially and politically dominant]{.underline}. This assertion of
identity---of who I am---adds to a body of knowledge about how my life
is and how I experience the world. Those truths debunk myths about me,
about my relationship with the world, and about my relationships with
others in that world that have heretofore been taken to be true. In this
vein, Patricia Hill Collins discusses a stereotypical understanding of
African American women working as domestic servants---the Mammy
stereotype which objectifies black women as 'faithful and obedient'
domestic servants, dedicated to the care of their white family---in
contrast to the Sapphire, controlling and manipulative, or the Jezebel,
a temptress \[1990; 456\].  As Collins shows, stereotypes such as these
serve as 'controlling images' that serve to reinforce for everyone,
including African American women, the ways of thinking from the point of
view of the racially and sexually dominant. This way of thinking
oppresses as it constrains what can be known about being an African
American woman. African American women, rather than racist and sexist
social structures, are blamed for that oppression. Thus [[the epistemic
process whereby a standpoint emerges enables the occupants of that
standpoint to gain an element of power]{.mark} and control over
knowledge about their lives]{.underline}. [In becoming occupants of a
standpoint, [they]{.mark} also [become knowing subjects in their own
right]{.mark}, rather than merely objects that are known by
others]{.underline}.

### Alt\-\--Intersectionality 

#### [Intersectionality]{.underline} solves as a [methodology]{.underline} for [research]{.underline} and [activism]{.underline} engaging in [reflexivity]{.underline}\-\--[analytical framework]{.underline} and [political orientation]{.underline}

[INTERSECTIONAL METHODOLOGIES AND PRAXIS FOR IR]{.underline}

So how do we [[incorporate **intersectionality**
into]{.underline}]{.mark} the study of [[IR]{.underline}]{.mark}? The
beginning of the chapter characterises [intersectionality]{.underline}
as a growing field where it is discussed not only as a
[theoretical/analytical [framework and political
**orientation**]{.mark}]{.underline}, but also as a [methodology and
praxis]{.underline}. While much of the work on
[intersectionality]{.underline} has been [theoretical]{.underline},
increasingly scholars (and activists) have been turning their attention
towards putting the various commitments of intersectionality into
practice. This section focuses on [intersectionality [as
**methodology**]{.mark}]{.underline}, both [[for **research** and
**activism**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

While there is not one way of [conducting intersectional
research]{.underline}, there are a few places where it might be
[incorporated within feminist methodologies]{.underline}. A distinctive
feature of [[feminist and critical methodologies]{.underline}]{.mark} is
the [[emphasis on **reflexivity**]{.underline}]{.mark} -- the need for
[[researchers]{.underline}]{.mark} to continually
[[reflect]{.underline}]{.mark} on their [[**positionality** and
power]{.mark} throughout the research process]{.underline} (Ackerly,
Stern, and True 2006). Often, research [reflexivity focuses
on]{.underline} the [power researchers]{.underline} hold in the research
process and the ways in which they may (intentionally or
unintentionally) [[oppress research subjects and cause
harm]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is important, and [[scholars need to be
**conscientious** of]{.underline}]{.mark} this, as well as the other
**[[power dynamics]{.underline}]{.mark}** that may be [[present]{.mark}
in research relationships]{.underline}. There is a much work in
[feminist methodology]{.underline} that [focuses]{.underline}
[on]{.underline} the ways of [[mediating power throughout the research
process]{.underline}]{.mark}, including via methods that [[emphasise
**group participation**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the
[research]{.underline} in ways that [[allow for **representation and
agency**]{.underline}]{.mark} (both of which are important [components
of intersectional praxis]{.underline}).

[[Intersectional reflexivity]{.underline}]{.mark} might also
[[reflect]{.underline}]{.mark} on the [particular [positionality of the
researcher]{.mark}]{.underline} and the impact it may have on the
research. Reflexivity in this way is an [important part of being a good
critical thinker]{.underline}. Our [positionality]{.underline} may
actually [prevent]{.underline} us from seeing relevant [[power
dimensions]{.mark} if we [are not]{.mark} [**intentional** about
uncovering them]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Intersectional work]{.mark}
coming [from]{.mark} the **[feminist standpoint]{.mark}**
tradition]{.underline} (a [[feminist theoretical
perspective]{.underline}]{.mark} that argues knowledge is socially
situated) argued the [[recognition of]{.mark} **[epistemological
privilege]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- that [those experiencing
oppression]{.underline} have a better understanding of the structures
and institutions that created those conditions. Humans are more aware of
environmental factors that work against them than those that work with
and for them. We are more likely to notice a slope when we are moving up
it than down it; when the wind is in our face than when it is at our
back. Thus, as researchers (and as activists and human beings), it is
useful to be reflexive on our own positionality in relations to others
in thinking through tensions that arise from conflicting understandings
and narratives.

In our analysis, we might want to consider a methodology that Matsuda
(1991, 1189), a legal theorist, simply calls 'ask the other question'.
She goes on to explain, 'when I see something that looks racist, I ask,
"Where is the patriarchy in this?" When I see something that look
sexist, I ask, "Where is the heterosexism in this?" When I see something
that looks homophobic, I ask, "Where are the class interests in this?"'
Her work focuses on [[building **coalitions** based
on]{.underline}]{.mark} what is essentially an [[intersectional
analysis]{.underline}]{.mark}, looking for both obvious and non-obvious
relationships of domination. Here, the work done by the scholars and
activists above can inform what questions we ask. What are the
[[dimensions of power]{.mark} that have been
[theorised]{.mark}]{.underline} or discussed by differently positioned
groups? How can we attend to them in our research? How might we be on
the lookout for additional dimensions relevant to the context? How might
we be complicit in [[enacting oppression]{.underline}]{.mark}, even if
we are unaware of doing so? And given that we might not be able to
identify our complicity, even when we are trying to [be
[reflexive]{.mark}]{.underline}, how can we respond to
[[critiques]{.underline}]{.mark} that are [[levied]{.mark} against us
[by]{.mark}]{.underline} those who may have the [[epistemological
privilege]{.underline}]{.mark}?

Beyond these general guidelines, which we should all be thinking about,
there are some **[[limitations]{.underline}]{.mark}** to what we can do
on a [particular [research project]{.mark}]{.underline}. And, as
mentioned earlier in the chapter, [[single-axis]{.mark}
[interventions]{.mark} are [not]{.mark} inherently
[bad]{.mark}]{.underline}; they are [[important]{.underline}]{.mark} and
sometimes **[[necessary]{.underline}]{.mark}**, particularly in
[state-centred [understandings]{.mark} of power relations]{.underline}
which often '[[render invisible]{.underline}]{.mark} or inconsequential
the racialized, gendered, and [[**class nature of power** in
IR]{.underline}]{.mark}' (Chowdhry and Nair 2003).
[Intersectional]{.underline} scholars (in the various traditions --
including postcolonial) have discussed the importance of
'**[[strategic]{.mark} [essentialism]{.mark}]{.underline}**[']{.mark},
which is the [[idea]{.underline}]{.mark} that a particular [[dimension
of oppression]{.underline}]{.mark} (or even a particular inter- section)
may be deployed contingently and strategically. This may be [[important
for]{.mark} scholarly]{.underline} [[**interventions** as well as in
organising **collective action**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The point is that
it is deliberate and in [[recognition of its limitations as well as the
potential consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The [[concept of powe]{.mark}r]{.underline} is central to the [[study of
international relations]{.underline}]{.mark}. Feminist scholars and
activists have done important work [[demonstrating]{.mark} how
[international processes]{.mark}]{.underline} and [[institutions]{.mark}
are products [and **producers of power hierarchies** that are
**fundamentally gendered**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Postcolonial and
transnational feminist have expanded upon this, highlighting the
complexity of intersecting dimensions, such as race, class, sexuality
and nation. [Intersectional [analysis]{.mark}]{.underline} is a
**[[crucial]{.underline}]{.mark}** means of not only recognising and
[[understanding]{.underline}]{.mark} the [multiple and [interlocking
dimensions of domestic]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[**global** and
**transnational power structures**]{.mark}, but also of the activism
aimed at challenging them]{.underline}.

#### Engaging in [intersectionality]{.underline} solves by [destabilizing]{.underline} slow and epistemic violence

Studies at Trinity College Dublin Ireland; Peace and Conflict in a
Changing World, p. 5; akshaj\]

The recognition of these continuums of violence leads feminist research
to consider peace and violence as co-constitutive in a series of
gendered entanglements that we aim to unravel. Here is where the
[feminist idea of **[intersectionality]{.mark}**]{.underline} is
particularly useful (Hill Collins, 1990; Crenshaw, 1989). The term
["intersectionality" has been [used to understand women's experiences
at]{.mark} the intersections of a [number of **simultaneous
oppressions**]{.mark} including race, class, caste, gender, ethnicity,
sexuality, disability, nationality, immigration status, geographical
location, religion, and so on]{.underline}. In this handbook, many
[[authors use intersectionality as]{.mark} a ([methodological]{.mark})
[approach]{.mark} that aims at [destabilising]{.mark} all
[static]{.mark} and abstract [classifications]{.mark} by
[exploring]{.mark} the various ways in which [oppressions intersect
in]{.mark} shaping [structural and political aspects of violence and
peace]{.mark}]{.underline}. We consider the [[decentring]{.mark} of
abstractions to be particularly [important]{.mark} as it
[enables]{.mark} **robust [analyses]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the
entanglements of different forms of [violence]{.mark} [as well
as]{.mark} the varieties of [peace]{.mark} and justice [in the
continuums]{.mark} of violence and peace]{.underline}. In short, by
destabilising static classifications and rigid boundaries,
[intersectional analysis makes the entanglements of violence, power, and
politics visible]{.underline}. Intersectionality as a feminist
methodological approach [[recognises]{.mark} that overt and
**[structural violence]{.mark}** are often entangled with **[epistemic
and slow violence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Unlike mainstream peace
research, critical feminist peace research also pays attention to slow
violence, namely to "a tender, intimately-scaled, lived violence that is
constantly being reproduced and reborn through individual bodies and
relationships" (De Leeuw, 2016, p. 17; Nixon, 2011). [[Slow
violence]{.mark} is often [accompanied]{.mark} [by epistemic
violence]{.mark} that [erases]{.mark} the space from which [alternative
knowledge]{.mark} claims can be vocalised]{.underline}. (Spivak, 1988;
also see Parashar and Orjuela, this volume) Through the [violent
[dismissal of the other ways]{.mark} of knowing, and by rendering them
inadequate, naïve and sentimental, knowledge, and speaking too, from
less privileged positions is rejected in conventional scholarship on
violence and peace]{.underline}. Critical feminist peace research is
attentive to these intersections of multiple violences.

#### Intersectional feminist inquiry interrogates how gender intersects with other axes of domination.

(pg 3-4) //KKang

The chapters in this collection pay close attention to this---[mostly
employing some form of intersectional **[feminism]{.mark}** which
**[implies]{.mark}** exploring how those identified as women are
experiencing global politics at [**the intersections** of]{.mark}
gender, [class, caste, race, sexuality, ability, indigeneity,
religion]{.mark}]{.underline}, and more. Embracing an intersectional
approach, which emerges from a critical political stance as a 'vision of
generating counter-hegemonic and transformative knowledge production,
activism, pedagogy, and non-oppressive coalitions' (Bilge, 2013, p.
405), means that one always has to pay attention to specific contexts
and their politics. As Nira Yuval-Davis summarizes: [**[Any
attempt]{.mark} [to]{.mark}** **[essentialize]{.mark}** 'Blackness' or
'womanhood' or 'working classness' as specific forms of concrete
oppression in additive ways, inevitably **[conflates]{.mark}**
narratives of [**identity** politics with]{.mark} descriptions of
[positionality as]{.mark} [well as constructing identities]{.mark}
within the terms of specific political projects.]{.underline} (2006, p.
195) Introduction 3 Without attentiveness to the specificities of
particular struggles within which narratives of identity politics are
articulated, the latter quickly mimics hegemonic representations of
identity where some, usually the already marginal members, are once
again excluded from belonging. [Doing **[intersectional]{.mark}
[analysis]{.mark}**]{.underline} and paying attention to the
particularities of each context is not an easy task, and it makes it
harder to draw simple conclusions. Ultimately, however, [this approach
**[is more accurate]{.mark}** and leads the authors to develop deeper
insights.]{.underline}

[[By looking for women]{.mark} in the international]{.underline}---by
developing a feminist curiosity about war and actually engaging with
people (Sylvester, 2013)---[[we]{.mark} [can learn]{.mark} much [about
global politics]{.mark}. Enloe reminds us: 'One of the starting points
of **[feminism is taking women's lives seriously]{.mark}**. "Seriously"
implies listening carefully, digging deep, developing a long attention
span, being ready to be surprised']{.underline} (2004, p. 3). What is
more, she says, 'a feminist curiosity finds all women worth thinking
about, paying close attention to, because in this way we will be able to
throw into sharp relief the blatant and subtle political workings of
both femininity and masculinity' (Enloe, 2004, p. 4, emphasis mine). I
would add that [**[paying attention to all women]{.mark}**,
[rather]{.mark} [than]{.mark} focusing only on global [élites]{.mark},
also implies that we are less likely to assume that gender is always the
primary category of analysis]{.underline}, but rather that it is one of
a series of markers that shape subjectivities and thus the positionality
of women. In other words, [recognizing how subject positions in varied
[**matrices of domination are** **always shaped by
intersections**]{.mark} of gender, race, class, indigeneity, ability, or
religion]{.underline} (to name a few) follows from paying close
attention to all women's everyday lives. It also has a profound impact
on the researcher herself, as will become clear to the reader when
engaging the reflections each author provides at the end of the chapters
in this book.

Feminist care ethics and feminist foreign policy

In this final section, I want to suggest how an [[ethic of care]{.mark}
might [inform]{.mark} a [feminist foreign policy]{.mark} in ways that
allow it [to challenge]{.mark}, rather than reinforce, [gender]{.mark}ed
[binaries]{.mark} [between realism and idealism, order and justice and
masculine and feminine]{.mark}.]{.underline} I suggest that there are
three attributes of an [ethic of care]{.mark} that [allow]{.mark} it to
achieve this: [[relationality, contextualism]{.mark} and
[revisability]{.mark}]{.underline}.

As seen by Carol Gilligan, one of the first theorists of
[['care']{.mark} [as]{.mark} a voice of [**resistance to dominant**
modes]{.mark} of ethical reasoning, the ethics of care sees people not
as 'standing alone', but as gaining their selfhood through their
relations with others]{.underline}. Self and other are different but
connected rather than separate and opposed (Gilligan, 1993: 147).
Morality, on this view, is about responding to the needs of others in
ways that are characterized by attentive listening, patience and
understanding. Universal moral principles of right -- so [[rational,
clean]{.mark} and [appealing]{.mark} -- [give way]{.mark} here
[to]{.mark} the [messy, relentless]{.mark} juggling act of navigating
[complex moral dilemmas]{.mark} [and balanci]{.mark}ng the
[competing]{.mark} needs of real, **[embodied
others]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This means constant re-evaluation of
beliefs and reflexivity regarding our own claims to knowledge. It is a
feminist ethics, not because it 'belongs' to women or because it is
anti-men or somehow against the ethics of justice, but because it
demands a [[question]{.mark}ing of the [script of
patriarchy]{.mark}.]{.underline} As Gilligan puts it, in the culture of
patriarchy, the different voice with its ethic of care sounds feminine.
Heard in its own right and on its own terms, it is a human voice
([Gilligan,
2011](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1755088219828768#bibr6-1755088219828768):
25).

Relationality has been a key feature of the ethics of care since Carol
Gilligan's first edition of In a Different Voice. On this view, all
selves are the product of relations, all the way down. [The apparently
autonomous self, so often seen in men and gendered masculine, is a
product not of some essential feature of 'manhood' but of a response by
men to conform to the codes of gender within patriarchy.]{.underline}
Over the past 40 years, research into human psychology has undergone a
radical shift towards accepting the interpersonal and relational nature
of human development ([Gilligan and Snider,
2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1755088219828768#bibr7-1755088219828768):
191). Recognizing this and [[accepting]{.mark} the [relation]{.mark}al
voice]{.underline} not as morally or psychologically immature, but
[[as]{.mark} a [human voice]{.mark} that is [thwarted by]{.mark}
pervasive [gender norms]{.mark}]{.underline}, is the first step towards
[[reach]{.mark}ing [across divides]{.mark}]{.underline} of difference
hierarchy and [[build]{.mark}ing [real connection]{.mark} with
others]{.underline}.

[[Relationality is not]{.mark} a [static]{.mark} ethical
concept]{.underline} or set of principles -- like 'rights' or 'justice'
-- rather, it is a [[way of seeing]{.mark} the world
[that]{.mark}]{.underline} [[addresses]{.mark} not only
[ontology]{.mark}]{.underline} -- the relational self -- [[but also
epistemology]{.underline}]{.mark}. Thus, knowledge is also understood
relationally -- [we must [ask who makes]{.mark} the [knowledge
claims]{.mark} and [from what]{.mark} vantage point]{.underline}, what
[[material circumstances]{.underline}]{.mark} [and]{.mark} what [[degree
of power]{.underline}]{.mark} (Minow, 1990: 178). As famously argued by
Martha Minow, [relationality is perhaps most significant]{.underline} in
the way that it shifts our [understanding of the problem of
'difference']{.underline}; seeing [difference relationally means a shift
from a focus on the distinctions between people to a focus on the
relationships within]{.underline} which we notice and draw distinctions
([Minow,
1990](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1755088219828768#bibr23-1755088219828768):
15). Thus, [[relational]{.mark} [approach]{.mark}es, [unlike]{.mark},
say, [dominant liberal]{.mark} rights [analysis]{.mark}, enquire into
the institutional practices that determine a norm against which some
people seem different, or deviant]{.underline}. To address
relationships, Minow (1990) argues, is to [[resist abstraction
and]{.mark} to [demand context]{.mark}]{.underline} (1990: 216).

Clearly, there is a close connection between relationality and context.
[An [ethic of care eschews universalizable]{.mark} moral
[principles]{.mark}]{.underline} that can be applied across time and
space. By contrast, it [demands attention to context]{.underline} -- to
the particularities of social location, historical background,
structural conditions and relationships between relevant moral actors.
In this sense, it is opposed to the logic of traditional moral theory,
which demands abstraction from context in order to gain objectivity. But
this [[objectivity]{.mark} is elusive]{.underline}; more than this, [it
[acts to create]{.mark} a [dichotomy between those who]{.mark} are the
[know]{.mark}ers, keepers [and enforce]{.mark}rs]{.underline} of moral
principles, [[and those who are compelled]{.mark} -- sometimes [through
'foreign policy']{.mark}]{.underline} -- to enact those principles. The
morality of 'arms deals' cannot be assessed outside of the context of
both the violent histories of colonialism and the liberal militarism
that defines the contemporary world. Feminist foreign policy will not be
transformative if it is reduced to enacting a set of moral principles,
or seeking to protect, promote or empower women (often because this is,
in the long run, good for 'national security' or 'economic growth'). A
foreign policy that works towards feminist goals is more likely to be a
slow, plodding process which considers historical and contemporary
relations between actors and recognizes the importance of context in
making decisions and policies.

Finally, [[revisability]{.mark} [refers to]{.mark} the [requirement of
epistemological humility]{.mark}]{.underline} -- the need to embrace
uncertainty and recognize that there are only better or worse courses of
action at any given time and in any context. When 'Amy', one of
Gilligan's (1993) subjects, responds to a question posed regarding an
abstract moral dilemma, she says, 'Well, it depends' (1993: 35). As
Gilligan explains, when considered in the light of Kohlberg's definition
of the stages and sequence of moral development, her moral judgements
appear to be a full stage lower in maturity than those of the boy. They
appear to reveal an inability to think systematically about the concepts
of morality or law and a reluctance to examine the logic of received
moral truths (Gilligan, 1993: 30). But from the perspective of an ethic
of care, Amy's reluctance to make universalized judgements stems from a
heightened perception of the role of context and the nature of
relationships in moral judgement.

It is this willingness to [live with [uncertainty]{.mark}]{.underline}
that [[defines **feminist care ethics** as critical]{.underline}]{.mark}
and will allow it to be, potentially, [transformative [in the long
term]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Kimberly Hutchings (2001) argues,
'Critique is premised on the impossibility of a definitive answer to the
conditions of its own possibility and can only content itself with the
acknowledgment of the revisability of any grounds on which its specific
claims are based' (2001: 90). The implication of this is that we must
[[let go of]{.mark} the idea of feminist foreign policy as '[principled
foreign policy']{.mark}]{.underline}. Principles have an unmistakable
allure; they work very well when we take what Raymond Geuss (2008) calls
an 'ethics-first' approach to politics -- where we [attain an [ideal
theory]{.mark} [of]{.mark} how we should act]{.underline}, and then, in
a second step, [apply that ideal theory to the [action of political
agents]{.mark}]{.underline} (2008: 8). But the [dominance of this kind
of thinking [in]{.mark} the [realm of]{.mark} 'ethical [foreign
policy']{.mark} has [led to]{.mark} a
'[**hyper-rationalist**']{.mark}]{.underline} (Rengger, 2000: 769)
[[approach to]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[suffering]{.mark} of the
peoples of the world, [where '**useful knowledge'**]{.mark} has [blinded
us to]{.mark} contingency, [context, embodiment and
emotion]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Revisability in ethics is not the same thing as moral relativism. As
Susan Hekman points out, the category of 'relativism' is parasitic on
its opposite, the possibility of absolute knowledge. Perspectival,
connected, discursive knowledge does not obviate the possibility of
truth, evidence or critical judgement (Hekman, 1995: 31). It does not
mean that states cannot make judgements in their foreign (and domestic)
policy about the allocation of resources towards programmes and policies
that aim to increase the participation and representation of women in,
for example, formal peacemaking and peace-building processes. There is a
[requirement, however, to [view each policy]{.mark} and programme on its
own terms and [in its own context]{.mark}]{.underline} and to
[[recognize]{.underline}]{.mark} the ever-changing [context of
[actors-in-relation]{.mark} [across]{.mark}]{.underline} multiple,
intersecting locations and scales -- across [[racial,]{.mark}
socio-economic [and ethnic divides]{.mark}]{.underline} and from the
household [[to the **'global' level**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

In this way, [not only do [traditional]{.mark} standards of
[knowledge]{.mark} make invisible their own impossibility, they
[hide]{.mark} **the [violence of IR's denials of failure]{.mark}** and
continued insistence on traveling failed paths despite the condemnation
of failure and the privileging of success]{.underline}. [IR's
**continued recursive [enactment of]{.mark} its settled
["standards"]{.mark}** []{.mark}despite their **obvious failure and
exclusiveness** [**makes invisible**]{.mark} the **raced, classed, and
[sexed impacts]{.mark}** []{.mark}of those **standards [and]{.mark}
their apparent objectivity**]{.underline}. Baudrillard's work provides a
path for navigating this disjuncture between signs (IR's "standards")
and referents (the fantastic notion that "good scholarship" exists
objectively) (Baudrillard, 1975). He argues that "[only **ambivalence,
as a rupture of value**... sustains a **challenge to the legibility,**
the false transparency of the sign... questions the evidence of the use
value of the sign (rational decoding) and of its exchange value (the
discourse of communication)]{.underline}." [This]{.underline}
ambivalence, Baudrillard argues, "[brings the political economy of the
sign to a standstill; it dissolves the respective definitions of symbol
and referent]{.underline}" (Baudrillard, 1981, p. 150). [Endorsing the
inclusion of nontraditional perspectives, classifying and categorizing
them, and **assuming inclusion's possibility** may all have violent
impacts]{.underline} (for discussions of the violences of inclusion see
Haritaworn et al., 2013, 2014; Mbembe, 2019). Moving of the
signification "knowledge" from any referent to which it was originally
tied makes method and research performances of scholarship, rather than
(the illusive) scholarship itself. If "research" is a performance of
scholarship, ["**[standards" for research]{.mark}** serve to
**[disguise]{.mark} the [fantastic nature of knowledge
cumulation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As such, [there is no space for
liminality[,]{.mark} uncertainty, change, inadequacy, and failure in
structural rather than passing senses]{.underline}. Yet looking beyond
the discourse of certainty, those pervade IR. A Baudrillardian
[ambivalence toward research programs and their truth statements can
reveal the recursivity of IR's standards of knowledge
cumulation]{.underline}. This is because [condemnation or rejection of
any given research program and its truth statements endorses its
assumptions about truth, as well as some of its assumptions about what
the international arena is and how it works.]{.underline} As such, the
idea that IR knowledge cumulation can be nothing but fantasy is
straightforward. [If the **[reification of standards o]{.mark}f
knowledge cumulation** [is a **signification divorced from a
referent**]{.mark}, where the recovery of the referent is conceptually
and practically impossible, then knowledge cumulation is and will
**always remain an empty signifier**.]{.underline} The only question is
how that empty signifier directs and is directed. We suggest that, in
**[IR]{.underline}**, more often than not, [knowledge cumulation
**directs and is directed by discursive seduction**]{.underline}. In
Baudrillard's words, [seduction is]{.underline} "[that which **extracts
meaning from discourse** and **detracts it from its
truth**]{.underline}" (Baudrillard, 1991\[1979\], p. 54). [What makes a
discourse of knowledge, of science, and of progress seductive "is its
very appearance: the aleatory, meaningless, or ritualistic and
meticulous circulation of signs on the surface, its inflections and its
nuances. All of this effaces the content value of meaning, and this is
seductive]{.underline}" (Baudrillard, 1991\[1979\], p. 54). Therefore,
if there could be an interpretive discourse of knowledge cumulation that
reached truth value, that truth value would be self-defeating, since
"[the meaning of an interpretive discourse, by contrast, has never
seduced anyone]{.underline}." This is the fundamental contradiction, in
Baudrillard's terms, that makes standards for knowledge cumulation in IR
internally impossible. He explains that "[every interpretive discourse
wants to get beyond appearances; this is its illusion and fraud. But
getting beyond appearances is appearance, and is hence subject to the
stakes imposed by seduction, and consequently to its own failure as
discourse]{.underline}" (Baudrillard, 1991\[1979\], p. 54). As such,
[what is left in/of the failed discourse can only be the fantastic, and
pretensions to success hollow.]{.underline} Inhabiting a Failure of a
Discipline [The need for success and the denial of failure depend
on]{.underline} two things: first, both [success and failure existing
and being identifiable; and]{.underline} second, [presuming a particular
normative relationship between success and failure.]{.underline} In IR,
as we discussed above, scholars are thought of as successes or failures
according to a complicated metric of disciplinary prestige based on
publication outlet, "scientific standards," and perception of the change
that they have caused in the discipline. [Work is characterized as
successful or failed based on whether it contributes to knowledge
cumulation. The discipline itself is understood as successful or failed
based on the aggregation of those measures.]{.underline} [On these
terms, the emptiness of disciplinary standards and the impossibility of
knowledge cumulation make every piece of scholarship and every scholar
in IR a failure and the discipline along with them]{.underline}.13 To
us, the identification of success/failure is impossible. Still, [we
focus our approach to "disciplinary IR" around questioning
the]{.underline} second [assumption]{.underline}, [that the normative
relationship between success and failure is such that success is good
and desirable and failure is bad]{.underline}. [Failure has been
insufficiently explored in disciplinary IR, both in thinking about the
disciplinary enterprise and in thinking about the world "out there"
which we purport to study.]{.underline}14 Here, [we look to theorize the
"upside" of the failure of the disciplinary enterprise of
IR]{.underline}. It is, after all, failure that Baudrillard called for,
in different words---a willingness to drop commitment to and passion for
a certain end in the recognition that both that end and its opposite are
empty signifiers. [Queer theorists have suggested that this sort of
failure---failure to live up to expectations which were messy, detached,
or a priori untenable---might be worth celebrating]{.underline}
(Halberstam, 2011). We build on these two understandings to embrace
failure in IR. [Often **failure is thought about as** either **a final
end** (something has failed), as **a stumbling block on a path to
success** (if at first you do not succeed, try, try again), **or as a
miscalibration** (we thought this was success, but really it is failure
instead]{.underline}). With Jack Halberstam, [we suggest a normative
reinterpretation.]{.underline} [[**Rather than seeing failure as an end
point**, or]{.mark} **as a [stopping point]{.mark}** on the way to
success, **[it can be seen as itself a politics]{.mark}**]{.underline},
"a category levied by the winners against the losers" and "[a set of
standards that ensure all future radical ventures will be measured as
cost-ineffective"]{.underline} (Halberstam, 2011, p. 184). Halberstam
uses the example of reproductive success. Inherited wisdom has suggested
for a significant amount of time that people should have children---that
a heterosexual marriage with biological offspring is the ideal of
success in one's personal life. That could be taken at face value:
success (measured in biological offspring to still-married heterosexual,
cissexual parents) is to be valued, and failure (measured in some other
reproductive result) is to be devalued. Or [the very normative value
attached to reproductive success is itself a weapon, where associating
failure with non-reproduction is a category levied against the losers by
the winners. Redefining all reproductive results as successful or
changing which reproductive results are measured as successful does not
change the weaponized, normalizing character of the concept of success.
[This is]{.mark} a metaphor for IR's disciplinary sociology, but it is
also [directly **applicable to IR's epistemological**]{.mark} **and
methodological [engagement with
non-heteronormativity]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Applied to IR, [the
normalization of "success" as the thing to which all (researchers)
should aspire reifies membership in the categories of "successful" and
"failed" and provides the "successful" with a powerful weapon to
continue to exclude, put down, and delegitimize the
"unsuccessful]{.underline}." The "winners" are by definition in a
normatively superior position compared to the "losers" despite the
emptiness of the signification of each category. [Understanding
individual pieces of work, individual scholars, or research paradigms as
failed (a foil to successful) is a categorization wielded by those who
have already been classified as successful to achieve and perpetuate the
exclusion of those whom they can constitute as inferior.]{.underline} In
this way, [research success is a category]{.underline} IR's winners
wield against its losers to perpetuate their position as winners,
consciously or unconsciously, **[against a background of a disciplinary
IR]{.underline}** [where the standards for research were created largely
by white, heterosexual cis-men and remain largely undisturbed despite
the intellectual and representational diversification of IR research and
IR scholars. **[Failure]{.mark} as a category [in IR
scholarship]{.mark}**]{.underline} [serves to "[reinscribe]{.mark} and
renormalize [standards of 'research success' which remain
unchanged]{.mark}, unchangeable, and regressive]{.underline}"
(Halberstam, 2011). The [scholarship that makes unconventional claims to
knowledge cumulation (or no claim to knowledge cumulation) not only
fails but constitutes its researchers as failures]{.underline}---which
becomes recursive when "we tend to blame each other or ourselves for the
failures of the social structure we inhabit, rather than critiquing the
structures... themselves" (Halberstam, 2011, p. 35, citing Kipnes,
2004). In Halberstam's view, [it is the system that privileges success,
that is, the problem, and failing within it is an emancipatory
possibility which "dismantles the logics of success and failure with
which we currently live]{.underline}" (Halberstam, 2011, p. 2).
[Realizing the caging nature of the boundaries of disciplinary success,
it is possible to think that failure might be perceived as something to
celebrate and strive toward rather than something which should inspire
shame.]{.underline} Halberstam suggests that "under certain
circumstances, failing, losing, forgetting, unmaking, undoing,
unbecoming, not knowing may in fact offer more creative, more
cooperative, and more surprising ways of being in the world"
(Halberstam, 2011, pp. 2--3). In Halberstam's view, [it is only when the
norms and metrics by which we aspire to success become both politicized
and problematized that freedom becomes possible.]{.underline} It is not
failing that we as scholars or as people need to learn to do---we fail
all the time. As Halberstam notes, failure is endemic in life and work
as "to live is to fail, to bungle, to disappoint, and ultimately die,"
despite denial, resistance, and constructs of success (Halberstam, 2011,
pp. 186--187). Instead of needing to learn to fail, we argue, [we need
to learn to embrace failure, particularly the collective failure of the
enterprise of "disciplinary IR" to achieve or approximate "knowledge
cumulation" generally or the aspirations of particular research programs
specifically]{.underline}. "Rather than searching for ways around death
and disappointment," Halberstam contends that it is important to
recognize, embrace, incorporate, and legitimize failure (Halberstam,
2011, pp. 186--187). Lee Edelman suggests that [pretenses of success and
the "failure to succeed]{.underline}" that is their foil
[are]{.underline} actually both on the same side---"[committed to
futurism's unquestioned good]{.underline}," aspirational to success, and
committed to a perceived normative value of success (Edelman, 2004).
Edelman [envisions]{.underline} **[another "side]{.underline}**"---"the
'side' [where narrative realization and derealization overlap, where the
energies of vitalization ceaselessly turn against themselves; the 'side'
outside of all political sides]{.underline}" (Edelman, 2004, loc. 97).
We argue [that it is in this ambivalent "side" that IR scholars should
see, experience, and live IR as such.]{.underline} Halberstam's account
of **[this "side" (or "[anti-side") is "the queer art of
failure]{.mark}."]{.underline}** Halberstam explains that "[the queer
art of failure involves the acceptance of the finite, the embrace of the
absurd, the silly, and the hopelessly goofy]{.underline}" (Halberstam,
2011, p. 187). If "[winning has become a byword for greed, arrogance,
profiting from others, and conformity]{.underline}" (Halberstam, 2012),
losing can be the art of rejecting those things, and, with them, the
normative value of the win itself. [The queer art of failure [wields
**negative affect and anti-futurity** as]{.mark} a tool of political
[resistance]{.mark}]{.underline} (Ruberg, 2015, p. 114), [suggesting
that active rejection of not only the standards but also the idea of
success constitutes the space of failure as habitable]{.underline}. In
this view, "every experience of annoyance, anger, sadness, and hurt
comes with its own value, its own message, and its own transformative
potential" (Ruberg, 2015, p. 115). As Ruberg urges, [there is space in
the willingness to "see willful self-destruction not as pathological
behavior from which queer subjects need rescuing but as an ecstatic
rejection of mainstream power structures]{.underline}" (Ruberg, 2015, p.
115). Embracing disciplinary IR's failures, then, has two potential
advantages: recognition and resistance. Failure and Grand Theory in IR
And they lived happily ever after. The end. No, really. [If IR's
state-of-the-field debates are alternatively narrativized fairy tales,
we have a replacement. We suggest that the fairy tales' idealized end
can be found not in success but in failure; not in agreement but in
controversy; not in aggrandized claims but in careful thought; not in
stability but in liminality]{.underline}.15 [It is hitching our wagon to
a failure of a discipline and acknowledging that failure that
constitutes and creates the possibility of a happily ever after for IR
theory]{.underline}. We see the answers to many of these questions bound
up in a disciplinary IR that has racist, sexist, heterosexist, and
cissexist intellectual orientations and remains silent about them and
often the assumptions that prop them up. But even work which decenters
or critiques these exclusions in IR, in our view, is positioned compared
to or in opposition to the discipline's existing structure. Rather than
being disappointed that IR theories are exclusive, cannot be reduced to
a single theory, cannot account for global politics as a whole, and
cannot present grand narratives of their competitive advantages visa-vis
other approaches, we suggest highlighting and inhabiting these failures.
Questioning the terms of disciplinary success as lying in a tightly
choreographed dance (peer review in elite journals) or a popularity
contest (citation count), or even in the "science" of knowledge
cumulation, we ask why empty signifiers continue to dictate value in a
wide variety of channels in IR. But [we do not think redefining success
will "solve" this "problem," no matter how well-intended or radical the
redefinition is.]{.underline} Note that we are not denying the existence
or importance of significant transgressive work within IR, work that
rejects grand narrativizing, or other explicit or implicit attempts to
embrace failure. We are under the impression that authors critiqued here
might actually agree with our critiques, either placing themselves
within them or taking exception to them. We are not looking to signal
virtue or to exclude, simply to suggest an explicit alternative
approach. [Instead of looking for an alternative, emphasizing some of
the "good" transgressions, finding another way to succeed, or recasting
success, we look to deconstruct IR's logics of success and failure,
and]{.underline}, with them, its [mimicry of reified standards and its
fantasies of knowledge cumulation]{.underline}. We see rewards in
embracing IR theory's failure to live up to IR theorists' expectations
of it. With Halberstam, "perhaps most obviously, failure ... disturbs
the supposedly clean boundaries between...winners and losers"
(Halberstam, 2011, p. 3). [Declaring, and embracing, knowledge
cumulation failure]{.underline} (and thus, IR's intellectual failure)
"[allows us to escape the punishing norms that discipline
behavior]{.underline}" (Halberstam, 2011, p. 3). [The relevant norms in
IR are the fetishization of science, the fetishization of progression
and progress, and the establishment and reification of boundaries of
what ideas matter to the field. In embracing failure and escaping those
punishing norms that are as violent in their inclusion]{.underline}
(e.g., Haritaworn et al., 2014) [as they are in their exclusion,
"**[queer studies offer us one method for imagining]{.mark}, not some
fan**]{.underline}

**[tasy of an elsewhere, but existing [alternatives to hegemonic
systems]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (Halberstam, 2011, p. 89). [It "can be a
potent form of critique,... a refusal of the norm, an indifference to
assimilation, and a route to other ways of being in the
world]{.underline}" (Halberstam, 2012). Here, [**the alternative to the
hegemonic system of claims of knowledge cumulation is the queer,**
understood as **both [liminal and anti-heteronormative]{.mark}**[, as a
foundation for **theorizing** ]{.mark}**more nuanced
[understandings]{.mark}** []{.mark}of knowledge than success or failure
at cumulation. If scholars find their affirmation in (hollow)
confirmations of their claims to knowledge cumulation, a queer politics
of failure suggests a different direction]{.underline}. As Halberstam
recommends, "rather than resisting endings and limits, let us instead
revel in... all of our own inevitable fantastic failures" (Halberstam,
2011, p. 187). [Reveling in fantastic failures, in terms of a queer
critique of the fantasy of progressive knowledge cumulation, has two
elements: celebrating research as failure and confronting the future
given that embrace.]{.underline} Queer theory suggests guidelines for
embracing failure; "[failing is something queers do well"---not (only)
in the self-deprecating sense of laughing at (one's own) flaws, but also
in the more fruitful sense of exposing the ridiculousness of norms by
failing to live up to them]{.underline}. In this sense, **[queer failure
is "a map of the path not taken]{.underline}**" (Weber, 2014a, 2014b).
As such, "queerness offers the promise of failure as a way of
life,...but it is up to us whether we choose to make good on that
promise in a way that makes a detour around the usual markers of
accomplishment and satisfaction" (Halberstam, 2011, loc 3281).
["**[Failing" to meet expectations]{.mark}** and being fine
**[repudiates]{.mark} the salvation [narrative]{.mark}** [that
**accompanies** ]{.mark}**the "right" [rules]{.mark} and norms** and
lifts the often terrible consequences of **falling outside "the norm"**
while removing the privileges of "belonging" to the category of
success]{.underline}. [The exposure and analysis of queer failure
**[denaturalizes]{.mark} the [coherence of knowledge-production
performances ]{.mark}**to **show the vapidity inside.**]{.underline} [We
see the replacement of "all-encompassing global theories" with those
"subjugated knowledges" which have been "buried or masked in functional
coherences or formal systemization" as a key first step but insufficient
by itself]{.underline} (Halberstam, 2011). Turning IR's "losers" into
its "winners" would both serve social justice and unsettle the binary
itself, but [rejecting the categories writ large would both upset the
politics of exclusion in those categories and discourage the win-seeking
behavior that makes state-of-the-field debates]{.underline}.
[Celebrating failure instead "provides the opportunity to use
\[failure's\] negative effects to poke holes in the toxic positivity of
contemporary life" where "the negative thinker can use the experience of
failure to confront the gross inequalities of everyday
life]{.underline}" (Halberstam, 2011, p. 3, 4). [The "toxic positivity"
in IR theorizing is the attachment to the utility of grand theory that
cumulates knowledge which makes the inequalities in the discipline
appear to be organized by some sense of objective quality, where
"success happens to good people" and good research while failure happens
to bad work or bad people]{.underline} (Halberstam, 2011, p. 3).
Instead, [we see those inequalities as structural and standards of
success in IR as political. IR's happily ever after, then, if it is to
have one, must be in the failure, in the mess, and in rejecting both
inherited interpretations of success and of the normative relationship
between success and failure.]{.underline} It must be not only in not
meeting expectations of any given state-of-the-discipline proselytizing
but also in instead realizing that [IR cannot and should not approximate
those expectations]{.underline}. [It is **not a progressive discipline
with a singular end** or an exercise in progressive knowledge
cumulation]{.underline}. [It is instead **necessarily
undisciplined**]{.underline}---[it must put aside the straightjackets of
research standards, the ego-stroking of aggrandized claims, and the
authorial voice of the telling of the discipline's past, present, and
future---to embrace liminality and the necessity (and beauty) of
failure. The irony of this argument is not lost on us]{.underline}.
Halberstam, making the queer theory case for celebrating failure, has
become a very successful academic by many of the traditional
disciplinary standards, and The Queer Art of Failure is a successful
academic text. Many of the critics and supporters cited here have built
on academic success by their engagement with the argument. We are
bringing the case to IR, publishing it in a academic journal, through
the traditional mechanism of peer review, from the comfort of secure and
permanent academic employment. We poke holes where those holes can be
seen by those who would police the boundaries between winners and
losers. This article does not "practice" as it "preaches," to itself
upend the "winners" and "losers" in disciplinary IR---it is couched in
both necessary and unnecessary hypocrisy. [But positionally at the very
least, our celebration of failure is itself a failure---implicated in
our interest in and disciplinary IR's promotion of success. We are not
arguing that failure can be made pure or that it should be---only that
it cannot and should not be escaped, especially for the glorification of
success as its perceived opposite]{.underline}. [As we fail at failure
to demonstrate the fantasy of success, we envision a happily ever after
of failing, un-discipline, and diversity rather than a faux idealism of
synthesis, aggrandizement, "science," and disciplining.]{.underline}

In short, [we need a [feminist ecological **accounting** system, capable
of **tracking**]{.mark} and promoting [climate justice economic
practices at every level]{.mark}]{.underline}, from local to global.
[[**Replacing** economic globalization]{.mark} (which in practice has
meant global corporatization and indigenous as well as ecological
colonialism) [with global economic justice]{.mark} offers a frontal
[**assault** **on climate change**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Industrialized
nations must pay our climate debts both to communities and to
ecosystems, as called for in the Bali Principles, and [develop economic
accounting practices that do not externalize the costs of a just
transition onto the environment and communities facing the outcomes of
climate change.]{.underline} [An **economic transition** from excessive
**takings** (i.e. "profits") from women, indigenous communities, the
Two-Thirds World, animals, and ecosystems to a green economy requires
sustainable jobs of the kind advocated by Van Jones\' organization,
Green for All. These jobs will include sustainable energy systems,
sustainable transit systems, and urban planning guided by environmental
justice]{.underline}.

The foundations for food justice have been growing for decades in the
food cooperative movement which began in the 19th century, and was more
recently resurrected in the 1970s. Today\'s food justice movement
includes Community Supported Agriculture (CSAs), the advent of rooftop
and community gardens exemplified by groups such as Will Allen\'s
Growing Power in Milwaukee, queer food justice farmers and gardeners
from Vermont to California, and Natasha Bowens\' ["Brown Girl Farming"
efforts to map food justice so that the food movement is not seen as the
domain of affluent consumers but is shaped by the **self-determination**
**of women and communities of color (**Bowens, 2013). With a
[posthumanist food justice movement reconceived to include other animal
species and to consider their lives in terms of reproductive justice,
the animal sanctuary movement]{.mark}]{.underline}---a corrective
response of entangled empathy, interrupting the practices of
industrialized animal agriculture--- may face a new opportunity: freeing
up the excessive land space now used by industrialized animal
agriculture, smallscale farming and community gardens alike will have
more land for farming and for freed animals. [This transition away from
industrial animal agriculture [begins by **ceasing** the artificial
insemination of female animals on **factory farms**,]{.mark} and
possibly **r[eturning]{.mark}** [freed animals to live out their lives
adjacent to community gardens and small farm]{.mark}s, where they can
provide cropping services and fertilizer, giving humans a chance to
**repay our interspecies debt**]{.underline}.

Overlapping with food justice, the Transition Town movement, named in
1998 and formally launched by 2005, has spread from its origins in the
United Kingdom to countries on every continent, with communities
responding to peak oil by building local food security through community
gardens and local energy security through renewables. Some groups build
on the movement for local currencies based on barter: one hour of
anyone\'s time is equal to another\'s. As Bill McKibben wrote in his
Rolling Stone article, "Do the Math" (McKibben, 2012), social and
environmental movements of the kind needed now are often inspired by
having an enemy. Pinpointing the globalized fossil fuel industry,
McKibben launched 350.Org\'s strategy of divestment, modeled on the
successful divestment strategies that prompted South Africa to end
apartheid. Withdrawing financial support from systems destructive of
global eco-justice is another necessary but not sufficient method of
resistance. While crucial to a just transition, economic boycotts and
micro-level community infrastructures providing an alternative to global
capitalism through local economics, energy, food, and governance can
still be overridden by global-level trade agreements, multinational
investments, and other forms of economic or militarized pressure.
[**Withdrawing** economic support from these global institutions of
ecological domination, [**investing** in systems based on
social/environmental/climate justice, and pressuring for equitable
representation within the international institutions of governance,
are]{.mark} equally **[crucial strategies]{.mark}.**]{.underline}11

Feminist scholars have invoked the concept of intersectionality
(Collins, 1990; Crenshaw, 1991) in order to describe the "intra-actions"
(Barad, 2007) of race, class, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, age, ability
and other forms of human difference, using this analysis to develop more
nuanced understandings of power, privilege, and oppression. But fewer
scholars have critiqued the humanism of intersectionality (Lykke, 2009),
[or proposed [**examining** **the exclusions** of species and ecosystems
from **intersectional identities**,]{.mark} addressing the ways that
even the most marginalized of humans may participate in the Master Model
process of instrumentalization [when it comes to **nonhuman nature** and
earth others]{.mark} (]{.underline}Plumwood\'s term, anticipating
Cosmopolitics and Critical Plant Studies alike).13 As an ecological
identity and [political standpoint resisting the Master Model,
ecofeminists once proposed the self-identity of "[**political
animal**"]{.mark} for First World eco-citizens (Gaard, 1998; Sandilands,
1994, 1999); [this view **resituates** humans within ecosystems]{.mark}
and [faces us toward assessing ecosystem flows]{.mark} and
**[equilibrium]{.mark}**, while simultaneously [attending to]{.mark} the
well-being [of our **transcorporeality**]{.mark} (Alaimo, 2008).14
[Joining a philosophical **reconception** of human identity with an

### Alt\-\--Solves Chinese Aggression/Chinese Leadership

#### Fem IR prevents conflict with China and creates an ethical world order

Janka **Oertel and** Rachel **Tausendfreund '22**,Director of Asian
Program and Senior fellow at the Center on US Politics and Power, FIIA,
"China's wolf warriors and feminist foreign policy: A German approach",

The speed at which geopolitical developments are changing the existing
order makes it difficult to keep track of all the different dynamics at
play. But there are indicators that can help Europeans detect what is
going on -- and help inform policymaking. It matters that the [Chinese
leadership is becoming more repressive]{.underline} and more
militarised. German [policymakers need to take seriously China's growing
emphasis on bellicose masculinity and restrictions on women's and
minority rights]{.underline}. These are important indicators that the
regime is moving in a worrying direction -- and is not a reliable
partner. [Feminist foreign policy research suggests]{.underline} that
when a regime starts to restrict women's rights and talk 'tougher', [one
should begin to worry about broader aggressive action to
follow]{.underline}. [Europe discounted and ignored similar developments
from the Kremlin for a decade]{.underline}, [meaning it was unprepared
for Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}. Europeans should
therefore begin to systematically track these indicators to inform
policymaking. German **[[policymakers need to take seriously China's
growing emphasis on bellicose masculinity and restrictions on women's
and minority rights]{.mark}.]{.underline}** De-escalate Furthermore,
although Germany [**[should not ignore]{.mark}** China's]{.underline}
increasingly bellicose **[posturing, [but neither should it mirror
it]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Instead, Berlin should **[[focus on
de-escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. German **[[leaders are ready and
willing to engage with genuine grievances from
Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But [engagement]{.underline} of this
kind [does not automatically mean cooperation]{.underline}. And
[it]{.underline} certainly [does not mean]{.underline} denial or
[ignoring the danger]{.underline} signs while continuing to pursue a
profitable status quo. Germany is at a stage in its relations with China
in which conflict is real and the risk of military escalation in China's
immediate neighbourhood looms large. Closer to home, aggressive
cyber-attacks are challenging business and society, and economic
coercion has become standard. **[[De-escalation therefore needs to be
engaged, clear-sighted, and firm on principle]{.underline}]{.mark}** --
but [not blinkered by a need to 'win' for winning's sake.]{.underline}
On **[the global stage]{.underline}**, Germany [**needs to work with its
partners [to offer enticing alternatives to Beijing's authoritarian
surveillance-state model]{.mark}**. And]{.underline} it needs to [frame
this as a competitive alternative, not as a contest for
supremacy]{.underline}. **[[Belligerent rhetoric does
not]{.underline}]{.mark}** tend to **[[gain]{.mark} much [ground]{.mark}
in]{.underline}** German **[public discourse]{.underline}**. So, **[the
country may be well placed to maintain [a non-threatening
framing]{.mark} for the nonetheless necessary economic and technological
competition -- perhaps [under an umbrella of 'principled
pragmatism]{.mark}]{.underline}**[']{.mark}. [When cooperative solutions
would be beneficial -- such as on climate policy or global health -- the
door for working together should remain open, but no necessary action
should be conditioned by China's willingness or unwillingness to
cooperate]{.underline}. At the same time, Germany should [lead an
effort]{.underline} not to reform, but [[to]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[actually redesign, a rules-based international
order]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It can do so only together
[with]{.underline} key partners, which support **[[new multilateral
codes of conduct]{.mark} (from AI to biotech and autonomous weapons)
that are [based on principle, not on a zero-sum
logic]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Diversify **[[A successful China
policy]{.underline}]{.mark}** for Germany [in [a feminist]{.mark}
foreign [policy framework will require creativity and
agility]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [it will be fundamental to work with a
diverse set of partners across a broad set of policy areas]{.underline}.
**[A feminist approach [would look at China beyond Xi and security
beyond military conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It would be archaic to
assert that, just because challenges have global implications, China is
a partner for Germany on areas such as food security. But, despite the
party's ever tighter authoritarian grip, Chinese partners remain in this
area and others. [[The focus should be on working with
the]{.underline}m]{.mark}. Instead of high-level exchanges, Germany and
Europe should place a renewed emphasis on more technical and small-scale
cooperation to strengthen and empower these partners as much as possible
under the current conditions. Finally, [[a feminist approach takes a
broader view of security]{.mark} than just as a matter of
conflict]{.underline} (or the absence thereof) [between states.
For]{.underline} European [policymakers, this view can provide a helpful
guide for understanding how to compete with the Chinese leadership's
narrative]{.underline} and offers, [which are particularly appealing to
strongmen around the globe]{.underline}. When [Chinese investment
projects are environmentally degrading or contribute to repression, this
is a security concern.]{.underline} **[[But the answer is not a military
one. By providing powerful values-based
alternatives]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [backed by financial heft and
pragmatic financing for high-quality infrastructure, digital
development, and green energy -- as well as mitigation and adaptation
[measures]{.mark}]{.underline} -- Europe **[[can make better rival
offers.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Germany's forthcoming **[national
security and [China strategy]{.mark}, together [with its
feminist]{.mark} foreign policy guidelines, [could provide the basis for
it to take the lead]{.mark} in doing so]{.underline}**.

aggression of Russia',
https://www.ips-journal.eu/interviews/feminist-foreign-policy-is-a-vital-response-to-the-chauvinist-aggression-of-russia-7087////jrc

I believe that this war has fundamentally changed German politics. The
whole package of arms shipments would have simply been unthinkable up
until the evening of 23 February last year. [**[Feminist foreign policy
is a vital response to the chauvinist aggression]{.underline}** of
Russia]{.mark}. To start with, [a feminist perspective
illustrates]{.underline} in the first place [how deeply sexism is
embedded in Russia's political and social system]{.underline}; how [the
[extremely patriarchal structures]{.mark} and hyper-masculinity [are
essential pillars underpinning this regime]{.mark}, its production of
legitimacy and its violence; and how sexism is part of the
aggression]{.underline}. [[The feminist perspective]{.underline}]{.mark}
and the view on gender, especially on private relationships**[, [are
immensely important fo]{.mark}r the early [detection of structural
violence]{.mark} and its potential impact, as regards both domestic and
foreign policy]{.underline}**. For [[if there is a lot of violence at
the private level, we]{.mark} [can assume]{.mark} that [it is
penetrating other levels]{.mark} too]{.underline}.

[[Feminist politics]{.mark} can]{.underline} also **[[play a key role in
creating sustainable peace in Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the
future: [politically, socially and economically]{.underline}[.
[This]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[encompasses the inclusion of
women]{.mark} and marginalised groups [in the political
process]{.mark}]{.underline}, as well as the participation of society as
a whole in reconstruction. [[The feminist perspective is
essential]{.mark} for this]{.underline}. I believe **[it has to be an
integral part of politics]{.underline}**. [[Asymmetric power structures
need to be changed to prevent them from leading to violence once
again]{.underline}]{.mark}. Germany's Feminist Foreign Policy has yet to
be filled with substance and implemented in concrete cases. It is only
just the beginning, but I'm happy that this perspective is now becoming
more important.

[This discussion will demonstrate, in the ways outlined above, the depth
and range of feminist perspectives on power]{.underline}---a prime
concern of International Relations and indeed of the whole study of
politics. It will illustrate the varied ways in which scholars using
these perspectives study power in relation to gender, a nexus largely
disregarded in mainstream approaches. [From **[feminist
positions,]{.mark}** this lacuna [marks out mainstream analyses as
trapped in]{.mark} a **[narrow]{.mark} and [superficial]{.mark}**
ontological and [epistemological framework]{.mark}.]{.underline} A major
part of the problem is the way in which the mainstream takes the
appearance of a predominantly male-constructed reality as a given, and
thus as the beginning and end of investigation and knowledge-building.
[[Feminism requires]{.mark} an [ontological]{.mark} revisionism: a
[**recognition** that]{.mark} it [is necessary to]{.mark} go behind the
appearance and [examine how]{.mark} differentiated and [gendered power
constructs]{.mark} the social [relations that form]{.mark} that
[reality]{.mark}.]{.underline} While it may be empirically accurate to
observe that historically and contemporaneously men have dominated the
realms of international politics and economics[, feminists argue that [a
full understanding of]{.mark} the nature of those [realms must include
understanding]{.mark} the intricate [patterns of]{.mark} (gendered)
[inequalities]{.mark} that shape them. Mainstream International
Relations,]{.underline} in accepting that because these realms appear to
be predominantly man-made, there is no reason to ask how or why that is
the case, stop short of taking account of gender. [As long as those who
adhere to this position continue to accept the sufficiency of the
appearances and probe no further, then the ontological and
epistemological limitations will continue to be reproduced. Early work
in [feminist I]{.mark}nternational [R]{.mark}elations]{.underline} in
the 1980s had to address this problem directly by **[[peel]{.mark}ing
[back]{.mark} the [masculinist]{.mark} surface of [world
politics]{.mark}]{.underline}** to reveal its more complex gendered (and
racialized) dynamics. Key scholars such as Cynthia Enloe focused on core
International [Relations issues of war, militarism and security,
highlighting the dependence of these concepts on gender
structures---[e.g. dominant forms of the]{.mark} masculine
([warrior)]{.mark}]{.underline} subject as protector/conqueror/exploiter
of the feminine/feminized object/other---and [thus the fundamental
importance of subjecting them to gender analysis.]{.underline} In a
series of works, including the early Bananas, beaches and bases: making
feminist sense of international politics (1989), Enloe has addressed
different aspects of the most overtly masculine realms of international
relations, conflict and defence, to reveal their deeper gendered
realities.3 [This body of work has launched a powerful critique of the
taboo that made women and gender most invisible, in theory and practice,
where masculinity had its most extreme, defining (and violent)
expression.]{.underline} Enloe's research has provided one of the most
comprehensive bodies of evidence for the ontological revisionism
required of mainstream International Relations, especially in relation
to its core concerns. [When Enloe claimed that 'gender makes the world
go round',4 she was in fact turning the abstract logic of malestream
International Relations inside out.]{.underline} This abstract logic saw
little need to take theoretical and analytical account of gender as a
social force because in practical terms only one gender, the male,
appeared to define International Relations. Ann Tickner has recently
offered the reminder that this situation persists: 'During the 1990s,
women were admitted to most combat positions in the U.S. military, and
the U.S. president appointed the first female secretary of state, but
occupations in foreign and military policymaking in most states remain
overwhelmingly male, and usually elite male.'5 Nearly a decade earlier,
in her groundbreaking work Gender in International Relations: [feminist
perspectives on achieving global security,6 she had asked the kinds of
questions that were foundational to early feminist International
Relations: '[Why is the subject matter]{.mark} of my discipline [so
distant from women's]{.mark} lived [experiences? Why have women been
conspicuous]{.mark} only **[by]{.mark} their [absence]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark} the worlds of [diplomacy and]{.mark} military and foreign
[policy-making]{.mark}?']{.underline} Tickner, like Enloe, has
interrogated core issues in mainstream International Relations, such as
security and peace, providing feminist bases for gendered understanding
of issues that have defined it. Her reflection on what has happened
since Gender in International Relations was published indicates the
prominence of tensions between theory and practice. 'We may have
provided some answers to my questions as to why IR and foreign
policymaking remain male-dominated; [but breaking down the unequal
gender hierarchies that perpetuate these androcentric biases remains a
challenge.]{.underline}'7 The persistence of the overriding maleness of
international relations in practice is part of the reason for the
continued resistance and lack of responsiveness to the analytical
relevance feminist International Relations claims. In other words[, it
is to some extent not surprising that feminist International Relations
stands largely outside mainstream International Relations,]{.underline}
because the [concerns of the former, gender and women]{.underline},
continue to [appear to be subsidiary to high politics and
diplomacy.]{.underline} One has only to recall the limited attention to
gender and women in the [[recent]{.mark} Afghanistan and Iraq
**[crises]{.mark}** to **[illustrate this]{.mark} point**.8 So **how
have feminists tackled this [problem]{.mark}**? Necessarily, but
problematically, [by calling for a deeper]{.mark} level of [ontological
revisionism]{.mark}.]{.underline} I say problematically because, bearing
in mind the limited success of the first kind discussed above, it can be
anticipated that this deeper kind is likely to be even more challenging
for those in the mainstream camp. The second level [of ontological
[revisionism required]{.mark} relates [to]{.mark} critical
[understand]{.mark}ing of [why]{.mark} the appearance of
[i]{.mark}nternational [r]{.mark}elations [as predominantly]{.mark} a
sphere of [male]{.mark} influence and action [continues to seem
unproblematic]{.mark} from mainstream perspectives. This entails
investigating masculinity itself: the nature of its subject
position---including as reflected in the collective realm of politics---
and the frameworks and hierarchies that structure its social
relations,]{.underline} not only in relation to women but also in
relation to men configured as (feminized) 'others' because of racial,
colonial and other factors, including sexuality. Marysia Zalewski and
Jane Parpart directly captured such an approach as 'the "man" question
in international relations'.9 I would like to suggest that for those
sceptical about feminist International Relations[, Zalewski's
introductory chapter, 'From the "woman" question to the "man" question
in International Relations', offers an impressively transparent way in
to its substantive terrain.]{.underline}10 Reflecting critically on the
editors' learning process in preparing the volume and working with its
contributors, both men and women[, Zalewski discusses the various
modifications through which the title of the work had moved. These
included at different stages the terms 'women', 'masculinity' and
'feminism', finally ending with 'the "man" question'---signalling once
again, I suggest, tensions between theory and practice, the difficulty
of escaping the concrete dominance of the male subject position in the
realm of international relations.]{.underline} The project's starting
point revealed a faith in the modernist commitment to the political
importance of bringing women into the position of subjecthood. We
implicitly accepted that women's subjecthood could be exposed and
revealed in the study and practice of international relations, hoping
that this would also reveal the nature of male dominance and power.
[[Posing the 'man' question]{.mark} instead **[reflects our]{.mark}
[diminishing belief that]{.mark} the [exclusion of women can be remedied
]{.mark}**[by converting them]{.mark} into subjects.]{.underline}11
Adding women appeared to have failed to 'destabilize' the field; so
perhaps critically addressing its prime subject 'man' head-on could help
to do so. 'This leads us to ask questions about the roles of masculinity
in the conduct of international relations and to question the accepted
naturalness of the abundance of men in the theory and practice of
international relations' (emphasis added).[12 The deeper level of
[ontological **revisionism**]{.mark} called for by feminist
International Relations in this regard is as follows. [Not only]{.mark}
does it [press beyond]{.mark} the appearance of [i]{.mark}nternational
[r]{.mark}elations as a predominantly masculine terrain by including
women in its analysis, [it]{.mark} **[goes further to question]{.mark}**
the predominant **[masculinity]{.mark}** itself [and the]{.mark}
accepted [naturalness of its]{.mark} power and i[nfluence]{.mark} in
collective (most significantly state) and individual forms.]{.underline}

In our private lives, the [[need for care]{.mark} is generally [expected
and understood]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Political [theory and social
policy]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, have traditionally [located
[care]{.mark}]{.underline} both "[beyond]{.underline} (or
[[beneath]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[politics and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[public]{.underline}]{.mark} sphere."1 Public
[[responsibility]{.underline}]{.mark} for care -- [care in the domain of
**[impersonal relations]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- is not widely
recognized or accepted. In contrast, many [feminist
theorists]{.underline} have attempted to [[demonstrate]{.mark} that
[care]{.mark}]{.underline} is [publicly and politically
relevant]{.underline}. As a result of their work, the value of care is
being increasingly recognized. In the context of [political
theory]{.underline}, an **[[ethic of care]{.underline}]{.mark}** has
brought to the [public for [dimensions]{.mark}]{.underline} of our lives
that have been largely uninvestigated. An ethic of care privileges
networks of human [[interdependencies that]{.mark} challenge the
public/private divide]{.underline} and the [[concomitant
role]{.underline}]{.mark} that care plays [[within such
relations]{.underline}]{.mark}. It emphasizes that across our lifespan
-- at all stages and in many situations -- we need care to "sustain the
best possible lives."2 From this [[foundation]{.mark} emerges a set of
[distinct values]{.mark}]{.underline} for [guiding]{.underline} our
[social lives]{.underline} and understanding the [[entire
spectrum]{.mark} of human experiences]{.underline} and human needs. The
values can be considered [[essential]{.underline}]{.mark} to living a
worthwhile, fulling, and [balanced life]{.underline}.

Although the theory continues to develop, [less attention]{.underline}
has been paid [to [care's **practical
implications**]{.mark}]{.underline}. While a small number of feminist
theorists have begun to seriously [[interrogate the
implications]{.mark}]{.underline} of the care [ethic's distinct values
for the public sphere]{.underline},3 to date there have been few
systematic [investigations]{.underline} of how social policy could be
[[transformed by a care ethic]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Iris Marion Young
has noted, "the ethics of care has done little in terms of applying its
[insights]{.underline} to the [[pressing social
policy]{.underline}]{.mark} issues of [[justice]{.underline}]{.mark} and
needs that face all [societies]{.underline} in the world."4 The
explorations of this book are meant to address the gap between
[theoretical [and **public policy analysis**]{.mark}]{.underline} by
considering the [[implications]{.underline}]{.mark} of [an [ethic of
care]{.mark}]{.underline} for a range of Canadian social policy issues.

The [[fundamental question]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[underpins]{.underline} the argument of [[Social Policy and the Ethic of
Care]{.mark}]{.underline} is "What are the consequences of the human
need for care in social policy?" In answering this question I consider
the values that we currently prioritize in the public sphere to
understand why we are making and justifying speciWc social policy
choices. If we start with the [[assumption]{.underline}]{.mark} that the
[need for [care]{.mark}]{.underline} should be taken seriously, then the
[status quo]{.underline}, [[developed]{.underline}]{.mark} in accordance
wit[h [the values and priorities of a **liberal justice
orientation**]{.mark}]{.underline}, is not acceptable. The limitations
of our current vision become illuminated and the need to
[rethink]{.underline} our values in [[relation to society, citizenship,
and future policy]{.underline}]{.mark} directions becomes clear.
Arguably, the inclusion of a care ethic can lead to [greater social
justice in social policy]{.underline} because it opens up new ways of
seeing human beings, their social problems, and their needs, and it
enables us to analyze critically how [government responds]{.underline}
to these. Specially, I intend to demonstrate how, from the [[perspective
of the care ethic]{.underline}]{.mark}, the centrality of [human
interdependence and care is [revealed]{.mark}]{.underline}.

From this [basis]{.underline}, I attempt to show that an [[ethic of care
prioritizes]{.underline}]{.mark}, with its very [distinct **[normative
framework]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} contextualizing the [human
condition]{.underline}, thereby giving [new meaning and
significance]{.underline} to [human differences]{.underline} that [arise
[from]{.mark}]{.underline} [[gender]{.underline}]{.mark}, class, race,
ethnicity, [sexuality]{.underline}, ability, and geographic location.
Because of its [[sensitivity and responsiveness]{.underline}]{.mark} to
other persons' **[[individual differences]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
uniqueness, and whole particularity,5 a care ethic opens new ways for
[[understanding]{.mark} experiences]{.underline} of [discrimination,
suffering, and oppression]{.underline}. And, Wnally, because it
[[rejects indifference to social]{.underline}]{.mark} [[consequences of
actions and decisions]{.underline}]{.mark}, an [ethic of
care]{.underline} can provide [valuable guidance]{.underline} for
governments and [social institutions]{.underline} to create more
[humane, effective, and [robust]{.mark} social
[policies]{.mark}]{.underline}. In sum, a care ethic
[enhances]{.underline} our [[understanding]{.underline}]{.mark} of the
**[[moral complexities]{.underline}]{.mark}** that are at the [[heart
of]{.mark} any social [policy]{.mark} issue]{.underline}.

Admittedly, [policy change]{.underline} is often
[[dependent]{.underline}]{.mark} on [[numerous political, social, and
economic factors]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, as John Kingdon has
argued else- where, [[politics and policy making]{.underline}]{.mark}
are driven by ideas as much as or even more than by [conventional
political processes]{.underline}.6 The fact remains that policies are
about choosing between a range of options and alternatives. Values,
which are at the [[heart of ethics]{.underline}]{.mark}, have been and
will continue to be instrumental in directing these choices. They allow
us to make [[reasoned]{.mark} arguments]{.underline} for why a
particular [[course of action]{.underline}]{.mark} is preferable over
another. When we consider what counts as a good reason in **[[policy
discourse]{.underline}]{.mark}** we are inevitably drawn into
[principles of [political]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[thought]{.underline}]{.mark}.7 All [public policies]{.underline}
therefore have implicit [normative dimensions]{.underline}. A
distinguishing feature of a care ethic is precisely that it is intended
to be an [[alternative source]{.mark} for [moral and political
judgments]{.mark}]{.underline}. It can be instrumental in contributing
to the kind of debate and discussion that often precipitate [fundamental
changes in social policy]{.underline}. If a care [[ethic and its
associated values]{.underline}]{.mark} came to bear on [[social
policy]{.mark} [decision making]{.mark}]{.underline}, then the
[[traditional **policy paradigm**]{.underline}]{.mark} would be replaced
by one that brings into view the realities of our lives and [aspects of
policy choices]{.underline} that have been traditionally
[[overlooked]{.underline}]{.mark} or ignored. A [[care
ethic]{.underline}]{.mark} brings to our attention the need to
[[contemplate]{.underline}]{.mark} how care fosters the necessary
[conditions]{.underline} for any [[society]{.underline}]{.mark} to
Xourish.

#### History proves\-\--ethics can transform societies

**McLellan '10** \[Betty; 2010; feminist ethicist and psychotherapist
with over 20 years' experience; Unspeakable : A Feminist Ethic of
Speech, P. 210-212; akshaj\]

The [[ultimate]{.mark} aim in the **[discipline of
ethics]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as stated in the Introduction, is to
[**[transform societies]{.mark}** with]{.underline} a view to
[[bringing]{.underline}]{.mark} about more [effective]{.underline} and
[[inclusive social justice systems]{.underline}]{.mark}. Thanks to the
[[constant activism]{.mark} of feminists in every
generation]{.underline}---analysing, researching, writing,
demonstrating, rallying, lobbying, speaking out---the lives of women in
Western countries have improved. Feminist historians and other
commentators acknowledge that there have been significant gains for
women in countries like the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia.

A [[huge step forward]{.underline}]{.mark} occurred at the end of the
nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century, when the battle
for [women's [suffrage was finally won in most **Western
countries**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For the first time, women were
permitted to vote on issues which affected their lives. The struggle
began in the mid-nineteenth century and continued for half a century
before the dreams of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, Susan B.
Anthony, Emmeline Pankhurst and others were realised. Two world wars
later and married women had been manipulated from dependent wives
(before the wars) to independent workers (during the wars when they were
needed to fill the gaps in industry) and back to dependent wives (after
World War II). Then there began what Betty Friedan called a "strange
stirring" in women in the 1960s (1963, p. 13). Women started verbalising
dissatisfaction with the second-class status assigned to them by the
male hierarchy. **[[Consciousness-raising groups]{.underline}]{.mark}**
were formed in many local [communities [across]{.mark} the [Western
world]{.mark}]{.underline} and evidence of the extent of women's
oppression and the depth of their dissatisfaction came to light.In her
[history of the feminist movement]{.underline} in the United States, In
our Time: Memoir of a Revolution (1999), Susan Brownmiller begins by
discussing her own [experience of consciousness-raising
groups]{.underline} in the 1960s and moves on to discuss the
machinations inside the US movement as they fought for [women's rights
on many different fronts]{.underline}. Gains were made for [[individual
women in **equal opportunity**]{.underline}]{.mark}---education,
employment, politics, the military and business. In other areas, huge
battles were fought against rape, battery, sexual harassment and
pornography. While there were many gains along the way, US feminists
admit that there is still a long way to go.

Two significant battles which have taken [[**centre stage** for US
feminists over several decades have still not been
won]{.underline}]{.mark}. They are the Equal Rights Amendment to the
constitution and access to abortion. According to Brownmiller, "Women's
Liberation found its first unifying issue in abortion, and abortion
became the first feminist cause to sweep the nation", but she admits
that the fierce and sustained counterattack by opposing forces has meant
that "abortion remains our most important and pivotal issue, the
linchpin, then as now, of women's struggle for equality and reproductive
freedom" (1999, pp. 102, 135). Finishing her memoir on a positive note,
Brownmiller sums up her history of the feminist struggles in the United
States by saying:

Rarely in history have women been able to set aside their other
[[concerns and political causes]{.underline}]{.mark}, their divisions of
class, race, religion, ethnicity, their geographic boundaries and
personal attachments, in order to wage a united struggle, so
[[revolutionary in its implications]{.underline}]{.mark}, against their
basic, common oppression. Indeed, a full century passed between the
struggle for suffrage and what is often called the second wave. But when
such a coming-together takes place, when the vision is clear and the
**[[sisterhood is powerful]{.underline}]{.mark}**, mountains are moved
and the human landscape is changed forever \[p. 330\].

While Brownmiller presented a realistic picture of a movement which,
while making huge gains, also had some losses, Naomi Wolf in Fire with
Fire painted a positive picture of a battle won. She describes Second
Wave feminism in the United States as a "genderquake" and urges
feminists to stop focusing on the negatives and begin counting the
gains, calling on them to move into the future believing that women now
have equal power with men. Describing the genderquake, she says:

Twenty-five years of [[dedicated feminist]{.mark} activism have [hauled
the **political infrastructure**]{.mark} into place]{.underline}, enough
women in the middle classes have enough money and clout, and most women
now have enough [desire and [determination]{.mark}]{.underline} to begin
to [[balance the **imbalance of power**]{.underline}]{.mark} between the
sexes \[Wolf 1993, p. xvi\].

The problem, as she sees it, is with women themselves. She laments that
"women lack a [[psychology of female power]{.mark} to [match]{.mark}
their [new opportunities]{.mark}]{.underline}" (p. xvi).

Feminists working in the areas of rape, battery of women in the home and
the effects of prostitution and pornography, as well as those
[[studying]{.mark} the effects of the [deliberate
**subordination**]{.mark} and excl[usion of women from most areas of
power and influence]{.mark}]{.underline}, are critical of Wolf's call
for women to focus on the positive and ignore the negative. Feminists
have a choice, Wolf says: either to "understand that we are in the final
throes of a civil war for gender fairness in which conditions have
shifted to put much of the attainment of equality in women's own grasp"
or to continue "clinging to an [outdated image of ourselves as
powerless]{.underline}" (1993, pp. xv--xvi).

#### Ethic of care is the only way to establish interconnectedness

**Stephany '17** \[Kathleen; 03/25/2017; Faculty Health Sciences at
Douglas College; How to Help the Suicidal Person to Choose Life: The
Ethic of Care and Empathy as an Indispensable Tool for Intervention, P.
78; akshaj\]

In this current chapter, [specific [components]{.mark}]{.underline} of
the [[ethic of care and empathy]{.underline}]{.mark} are presented as an
actual tool for suicide intervention. These include,
[[establishing]{.mark} connection]{.underline}, fostering a [therapeutic
**[alliance]{.mark}**]{.underline}, offering [[unconditional
positive]{.mark} [regard]{.mark}]{.underline}, heartfelt listening,
presencing and compassion. Key aspects of The Aeschi Working Group of
suicidologists' Guidelines for Clinicians will be reviewed. A touching
narrative case study is presented where we learn how a total stranger
helped a suicidal girl through an act of compassion. A psychological
autopsy follows this story and assists us in gaining a retrospective
view of what went wrong in the emergency room (ER) and why. Near the end
of the Chapter, **[[Cognitive Therapy]{.underline}]{.mark}** is
recommended once a suicidal person's initial crisis has subsided. A
[[dynamic simulation]{.underline}]{.mark} exercise is then presented in
two parts to help gatekeepers practice being empathetic with a suicidal
patient. In closing, caregivers are encouraged to [[practice
empathy]{.underline}]{.mark} in their daily round through the act of
journaling to increase self-awareness.

[THE ETHIC OF CARE AS THE WEB OF CONNECTION]{.underline}

The [[ethic of care]{.underline}]{.mark} is [[**multi-dimensional** and
values]{.mark} our [relationships to others]{.mark}]{.underline},
context, a [[sense of]{.underline} [community]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} our
**[[interconnectedness]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Gilligan, 1982; Noddings;
1984; Watson, 2008). The [ethic of care]{.underline} also
[[admonishes]{.underline}]{.mark} us to attend to the [[needs of]{.mark}
all other [persons]{.mark}]{.underline}, including those in our [[direct
care]{.underline}]{.mark} as well as everyone else, even those we do not
know (Noddings, 1984; Slote, 2007). In fact, caring for one another is
not [depicted as a nicety]{.underline}, it is [[portrayed as a necessity
for the **survival of all humans**]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, if
we do not care about everyone we will not take [moral
action]{.underline} to help those who are in need, or to [preserve
life]{.underline} (Noddings, 1984; Slote, 2007). In fact the [[ethic of
care **promotes** a web of connection]{.underline}]{.mark} that is
[[inclusive of everyone and excludes no one]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Gilligan, 1982; Stephany, 2012).

### Alt\-\--International Movements

#### Forefront feminist pedagogy is key to trans-national feminist movements\-\--only starting from people's experience of the state can contribute to change.

Review: Revisiting gendered states: feminist imaginings of the state in
international relations. International Affairs. 03-01-2020. 96(2)

As with all edited volumes, what is gained in diversity of cases is
occasionally lost in overall analytical consistency. The contributions
work well together, but function more as independent chapters than
integral parts of a central argument. Moreover, while providing broad
insight into gendered states, questions remain about the implications of
these observations for emancipatory feminist goals. For instance,
Parashar, Tickner and True challenge depictions of the gender-neutral
state, but leave open the possibility of the state as source of gender
justice (p. 3). Yet the chapters do not coalesce around a distinctive
prescription for overcoming the forms of oppression and inequality that
are so often constructed and reinforced through gendered states.
*Tickner draws inspiration from* **[local and international [indigenous
struggles]{.mark}]{.underline}** *for justice, highlighting the
significance of pursuing change [through]{.mark} multilevel*
**[[pluralistic governance]{.underline}]{.mark}** (pp. 29--30). *True
hopes [transnational feminist movements]{.mark} [can pressure gendered
states]{.mark}* to respond to reactionary backlash against women's
rights by becoming more equitable and inclusive (pp. 46--7). David
Duriesmith argues that *liberal states can become* **[feminist
allies]{.underline}**, *but only if they systematically acknowledge and
dismantle male supremacy* (pp. 65--6). Lesley Pruitt suggests that
*[countries in the global South]{.mark} can make unique contributions to
expanding and* **[[implementing the Women, Peace, and Security
agenda]{.mark} in innovative ways]{.underline}** (pp. 128--9) *that
transcend neo-liberal visions of gender equality that have become
normative in the global North* (pp. 136--7). Katrina Lee-Koo cautions
that **[tolerance of 'pragmatic patriarchy' during crises locks in
gender inequality, making it difficult to challenge in the long
term]{.underline}** (p. 139). In sum, Revisiting gendered states
provides rich new material that will be of interest to feminist IR
scholars and students studying the role of gender in international and
comparative politics. The chapters are highly amenable to being assigned
on syllabuses. Researchers considering new projects will find
inspiration in the multiplicity of cases and themes identified in the
volume. At the same time, these qualities mean that those seeking
definitive answers to how we might transcend gendered states may be left
with as many questions as answers. In the face of these instabilities
and ambiguities, Christine Sylvester's concluding admonishment that *w[e
would be wise to 'study]{.mark} the state as* **[[people's experiences
of the state]{.underline}]{.mark}***,* **[[not so much the state
itself]{.underline}]{.mark}** ' (p. 195) *helpfully [reminds us of
the]{.mark} unique, [bottom-up]{.mark}, humanistic contribution that
[feminist perspectives]{.mark} can offer to the understanding of
political life*.

#### Solves the case\-\--

#### Drawing on the imaginaries of feminists such as [Elise Boulding]{.underline} and [Rokeya Hossein]{.underline} creates futrues without [weapons]{.underline} or [sovereignty]{.underline}\-\--it removes the impetus for [defense pacts]{.underline}.

This led her to begin *[her]{.mark} own [work]{.mark} on
[imagining]{.mark}* **[alternative, peaceful
[futures]{.mark}]{.underline}** by holding workshops where participants
were projecting 30 years into the future to ask: "**[[If there are no
more weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}***, how is the world functioning*?"
(Boulding, 1988, 1989). Revisiting this work at the end of the 1980s,
Boulding wrote, "I am not exactly sure when it began to dawn on me that
most of the peace movement activists I knew, from armscontrollers to
out-and-out disarmers, did not in their hearts believe that a world
without armies was possible" (1989: 74). Meanwhile, due to her work on
utopian imagery in varied civilizational traditions, *Boulding realized
that "[an inclination to visualize]{.mark} one's own society in [a
future peaceable state]{.mark} was testified to in the literary and oral
traditions of* **[every major culture]{.underline}**" (1989: 74), yet
*[this was]{.mark} almost completely [lacking in "the privileged
sectors]{.mark} of the* **[industrialized world]{.underline}**, both
East and West" (1989: 74). At the same time, it was clear to her "that
the human capacity for imagining the good society is not lost, only
weakened. It can be nurtured back to vigorousness, liveliness" (1989:
81).

*[A key element]{.mark} of Boulding's research to strengthen her
understanding of* **[what a weapons-free society]{.underline}** *would
look like* (and teaching it to others) [*was the* **[knowledge she
accumulated]{.underline}**]{.mark} *of peaceful societies and everyday
behaviors* (e.g. Boulding, 1992b, 1996, 2000). **[Always a
scholar-activist]{.underline}**, in her key works---The Underside of
History: A View of Women Through Time (1992b) and Cultures of Peace: The
Hidden History (2000)---"*she makes a cogent plea for educators to get
to know alternative histories*, and for engendering some practical hope"
(Hutchinson and Milojevic, 2012: 152). In Cultures of Peace, Boulding
specifically emphasized that the "*[recovery of]{.mark} hidden strengths
of [local cultures]{.mark} is one important aspect of peace building*
for this painful transitional period in contemporary history" (2000:
92). After reviewing the practices of several contemporary communities,
she proposed: "underneath the layers of violence each society, without
exception has its peace behaviors, *precious resources [that can be
available to bring about]{.mark} new and [gentler forms of
governance]{.mark} locally and [on a larger scale]{.mark} in the next
century*" (2000: 101).

### Alt\-\--Ontological Revisionism 

#### Vote negative for ontological revisionism\-\--shifting away from androcentric biases

**Youngs '04** \[Gillian; 01/2004; Senior Lecturer at the University of
Leicester; Feminist International Relations: A Contradiction in Terms?
Or: Why Women and Gender Are Essential to Understanding the World \'We\'
Live in, p. 77-80; akshaj\]

**[Ontological revisionism]{.underline}**

This discussion will demonstrate, in the ways outlined above, the [depth
and range of [feminist perspectives on power]{.mark}-a prime concern of
International Relations]{.underline} and indeed of the whole study of
politics. It will illustrate the varied ways in which scholars using
these [[perspectives study power in relation to
gender]{.underline}]{.mark}, a nexus largely disregarded in mainstream
approaches. From [feminist positions]{.underline}, this lacuna marks out
[**[mainstream]{.mark}** analyses as [trapped in]{.mark} a narrow and
**[superficial]{.mark}** [ontological and epistemological
framework]{.mark}]{.underline}. A major part of the problem is the way
in which the [mainstream]{.underline} takes the appearance of a [[pre-
dominantly **male-constructed** reality]{.underline}]{.mark} as a given,
and thus as the beginning and end of investigation and
knowledge-building. [[Feminism requires an ontological
revisionism]{.underline}]{.mark}: a recognition that it is necessary to
go behind the appearance and examine how differentiated and
[[gendered]{.mark} power [constructs]{.mark} the social relations [that
form that]{.mark} [reality]{.mark}]{.underline}.

While it may be empirically accurate to observe that historically and
contemporaneously [[men]{.mark} have **[dominated]{.mark}** the realms
of [international politics and economics]{.mark}]{.underline},
[feminists argue]{.underline} that a [full]{.underline} understanding of
the nature of those [[realms must]{.mark} [include]{.mark} understanding
the [intricate patterns of **(gendered) inequalities** that shape
them]{.mark}]{.underline}. Mainstream International Relations, in
[accepting]{.underline} that because these [realms]{.underline} appear
to be [predominantly man-made]{.underline}, there is no reason to ask
how or why that is the case, [stop short of taking account of
gender]{.underline}. As long as those who adhere to this position
continue [to accept the sufficiency of the appearances and [probe no
further]{.mark}]{.underline}, then the [[ontological and epistemological
**limitations** will continue to be reproduced]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Early work in feminist International Relations in the I980s had to
address this problem directly by [[peeling back]{.mark} the
[masculinist]{.mark} surface of world [politics]{.mark} to
[reveal]{.mark} its more [complex gendered]{.mark} (and racialized)
**[dynamics]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Key scholars such as Cynthia Enloe
focused on core International Relations issues of war, militarism and
security, highlighting the [[dependence of]{.mark} these concepts on
[gender structures]{.mark}]{.underline}-e.g. [dominant forms of the
[masculine]{.mark}]{.underline} (warrior) [**[subject]{.mark}** as
protector/conqueror/exploiter]{.underline} of the
[[feminine]{.mark}/feminized **[object]{.mark}**/other-and thus the
[fundamental]{.mark} [importance]{.mark} of [subjecting them to **gender
analysis**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In a series of works, including the
early Bananas, beaches and bases: making [feminist sense of
international politics]{.underline} (I989), Enloe has addressed
di[fferent [aspects]{.mark} of the most [overtly]{.mark}
[masculine]{.mark} realms of international relations]{.underline},
conflict and defence, to reveal their [deeper [gendered
realities]{.mark}]{.underline}.3 This body of work has launched a
**[[powerful critique]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the taboo that [made
[women]{.mark} and gender most [invisible]{.mark}]{.underline}, in
theory and practice, where [[masculinity]{.underline}]{.mark} had its
[most extreme]{.underline}, defining ([and
**[violent]{.mark}**]{.underline}) expression. Enloe\'s research has
provided one of the most comprehensive bodies of evidence for the
[[ontological revisionism required]{.underline}]{.mark} of mainstream
[International Relations]{.underline}, [especially in relation to its
core concerns]{.underline}.

When Enloe claimed that \'gender makes the world go round\',4 fact
turning the [[abstract logic]{.mark} of malestream International
Relations]{.underline} This abstract logic saw little need to take
[theoretical and [analytic gender as a **social
force**]{.mark}]{.underline} because in [practical terms only one
gender]{.underline} appeared to define International Relations. Ann
Tickner has recently the reminder that this situation persists: \'During
the I990s, women w to most combat positions in the U.S. military, and
the U.S. president appointed the first female secretary of state, but
occupations in foreign and military [**[policy-making]{.mark}** in most
states remain [overwhelmingly]{.mark} male, and usually **[elite
male]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\'5

Nearly a decade earlier, in her groundbreaking work Gender in
International Relations: [[feminist perspectives on achieving **global
security**]{.underline}]{.mark},6 she had asked the kinds of
[[questions]{.underline}]{.mark} that were [[foundational]{.mark} to
early feminist [I]{.mark}nternational [R]{.mark}elations]{.underline}:
\'Why is the subject matter of my discipline so distant from women\'s
lived experiences? Why have [[women]{.underline}]{.mark} been
conspicuous only by their [[absence]{.mark} in the worlds [of
diplomacy]{.mark} and military and foreign policy-making]{.underline}?\'
Tickner, like Enloe, has [interrogated]{.underline} core issues in
mainstream International Relations, such as [security and
peace]{.underline}, providing [[feminist bases for]{.mark} gendered
[understanding of issues]{.mark}]{.underline} that have defined it. Her
[reflection]{.underline} on what has happened since Gender in
International Relations was published indicates the [[prominence of
tensions between theory and practice]{.underline}]{.mark}. \'We may have
provided some answers to my questions as to why [IR and foreign
policymaking [remain male-dominated]{.mark}]{.underline}; but breaking
down the [[unequal]{.mark} gender [hierarchies]{.mark} that
[perpetuate]{.mark} these **[androcentric biases]{.mark}**]{.underline}
remains a challenge.\'7

The [[persistence of]{.mark}]{.underline} the overriding [[maleness of
i]{.mark}nternational [r]{.mark}elations]{.underline} in practice is
part of the reason for the [continued resistance and [lack of
responsiveness]{.mark} to the analytical relevance feminist
International Relations claims]{.underline}. In other words, it is to
some extent not surprising that feminist International Relations stands
largely [outside mainstream International Relations]{.underline},
[because]{.underline} the [concerns of the former]{.underline}, gender
and women, continue to appear to be [subsidiary to high politics and
diplomacy]{.underline}. One has only to recall the limited attention to
gender and women in the recent Afghanistan and Iraq crises to illustrate
this point.8 So how have feminists tackled this problem? Necessarily,
but problematically, by [[calling for a deeper]{.mark} [level of
**ontological revisionism**]{.mark}]{.underline}. I say problematically
because, bearing in mind the limited success of the first kind discussed
above, it can be anticipated that this deeper kind is likely to be even
more challenging for those in the mainstream camp.

The second level of [[ontological revisionism required]{.mark} relates
[to **critical understanding**]{.mark}]{.underline} of why the
appearance of international relations as predominantly a sphere of male
influence and action continues to seem [[unproblematic from
mainstream]{.mark} [perspectives]{.mark}]{.underline}. This entails
[[**investigating** masculinity]{.underline}]{.mark} itself: the nature
of its subject position-including as reflected in the collective realm
of [politics- and the [frameworks]{.mark} and hierarchies]{.underline}
that [[structure]{.mark} its **[social relations]{.mark}**]{.underline},
not only in [relation to women]{.underline} but also in relation to men
configured as ([feminized]{.underline}) [\'others\' because of racial,
colonial and other factors]{.underline}, including sexuality. Marysia
Zalewski and Jane Parpart directly captured such an approach as \'the
\"man\" question in international relations\'.9 I would like to suggest
that for those sceptical about feminist International Relations,
Zalewski\'s introductory chapter, \'From the \"woman\" question to the
\"man\" question in International Relations\', offers an impressively
transparent way in to its substantive terrain.?0 Reflecting critically
on the editors\' learning process in preparing the volume and working
with its contributors, both men and women, Zalewski discusses [the
various modifications through which the title of the work had
moved]{.underline}. These included at different stages the terms
\'women\', \'masculinity\' and \'feminism\', finally ending with \'the
\"man\" question\'-signalling once again, I suggest, [[tensions
between]{.mark} [theory and practice]{.mark}]{.underline}, the
difficulty of **[[escaping]{.underline}]{.mark}** the concrete
[[dominance of the male]{.mark} subject position in the realm of
international relations]{.underline}.

The [[project\'s]{.underline}]{.mark} starting point [revealed a [faith
in the **modernist commitment**]{.mark} to the political importance of
[bringing women into the position of
**subjecthood**]{.mark}]{.underline}. We implicitly accepted that
women\'s subjecthood could be exposed and revealed in the study and
practice of international relations, hoping that this would also
[[reveal the nature of male dominance]{.mark} and power]{.underline}.
Posing the \'man\' question instead reflects our [diminishing
belief]{.underline} that the [exclusion of [women]{.mark}]{.underline}
can be [remedied by [converting them into
subjects]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"

[Adding women]{.underline} appeared to have failed to
[**[\'destabilize\']{.mark}** the [field]{.mark}]{.underline}; so
perhaps [critically [addressing]{.mark}]{.underline} its [prime subject
\'man\' head-on]{.underline} could help to do so. \'This leads us to ask
questions about the [[roles of masculinity]{.mark} in]{.underline} the
conduct of [international relations]{.underline} and to
[question]{.underline} the [[accepted
**naturalness**]{.underline}]{.mark} of the abundance of men in the
theory and practice of international relations\' (emphasis added).I2 The
[[deeper level of ontological revisionism]{.underline}]{.mark} called
for by feminist Inter- national Relations in this regard is as follows.
Not only does it press beyond the appearance of [international
relations]{.underline} as a [[predominantly]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**[masculine terrain]{.mark}** by [including women in its
analysis]{.mark}]{.underline}, it goes further to question the
predominant masculinity itself and the accepted naturalness of its power
and [[influence]{.mark} in [collective]{.mark} (most significantly
[state) and individual forms]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Scientific [research on **mindfulness**]{.mark} training]{.underline}
and practice abounds in [clinical and health studies]{.underline},
[neurosciences and neurophenomenology]{.underline} (Kabat-Zinn 2003,
2005).3 These studies shift the [**[dualist understanding]{.mark}**
between thought and non- thought]{.underline}, showing how meditation,
the [[practice of cultivating positive emotions]{.underline}]{.mark},
has [[concrete]{.mark} measurable **[consequences]{.mark}** on the
body]{.underline}. For example, studies show that meditation builds the
immune system, and [[facilitates]{.mark} and speeds
[healing]{.mark}]{.underline} alongside Western medicine. There is also
a [[growing]{.mark} body of [research on
alternative]{.mark}]{.underline} healing methods (Franquemont 2009) and
[scientific studies of prayer for healing]{.underline} (Dossey 2010),
which all point to the [need to [develop **conceptual
knowledge**]{.mark}]{.underline} of the mind-body interaction, and
[[understand nonlinear time and nonlocal
communication]{.underline}]{.mark} in the [context of health and
healing]{.underline}.

In addition to [clinical research in health sciences and
psychology]{.underline} there has been [[considerable interest]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} the cognitive and **[neurosciences]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
investigating the effect [of [meditation on brain
activity]{.mark}]{.underline} (Kabat-Zinn 2003; Hölzel et al. 2011).
There have been [cross-cultural research projects]{.underline} involving
Tibetan monks practicing meditations and neuroscientists measuring brain
activity during meditation. Understanding the [[Eastern]{.mark}
philosophical [tradition]{.mark}]{.underline} of meditation is
[[**essential** for]{.mark} interpreting the [data]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The investigation of specific meditative areas, such as [[positive
feelings]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[compassion]{.underline}]{.mark} and the
[[devotion]{.mark} of a trained long-term monastic
practitioner]{.underline} "show a range of [[**stable patterns** of
brain activity]{.underline}]{.mark} ('neural signatures of different
mental states') that have never been observed in [naïve
subjects]{.underline}, [[patterns]{.underline}]{.mark} that could be
[[replicated by the subject]{.mark} at will]{.underline}, depending on
his choice of meditative practice" (Kabat-Zinn 2003: 147). These
[[research projects]{.underline}]{.mark} show that [[mindfulness
meditation]{.underline}]{.mark} concretely [[changes brain]{.mark}
activity and capacity]{.underline}. It is also shown to increase the
density of gray matter in the brain (Hölzel et al. 2011). These research
projects [complement contemporary [research on brain
plasticity]{.mark}]{.underline} in [[repairing]{.mark} **[neurological
damage]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The evidence of these research projects
[moves [beyond]{.mark} the **[mechanistic paradigm]{.mark}** and
computational [model of the human brain]{.mark}]{.underline}4 and
develops understanding of how the [practice of the mind influences
health and healing]{.underline}.

### Link Turn\-\--State

#### Transnational politics through the state solves best\-\--rejecting violent politics key

**Sylvester '13** \[Christine; 05/06/2013; Professor of political
science at University of Connecticut, affiliated with the School of
Global Studies at The University of Gothenburg Sweden; War as
experience: Contributions from International Relations and Feminist
Analysis, p. 61-62; akshaj\]

In that regard, feminist theorist Butler (2004b) has had much more of an
[[**impact** on feminist IR war]{.underline}]{.mark} studies by
[theorizing the [potential for]{.mark} a **[transnational
politics]{.mark}**]{.underline} based on the [grieving and
mourning]{.underline} common to wars everywhere. Her theme resonates
with Tarak Barkawi's sense, presented in Chapter 1, that [[war]{.mark}
is actually a [sign of intensified]{.mark} rather than diminished
**[social connections]{.mark}** between friends and foes]{.underline}.
It is a point that feminist analysis needs to take on board and unpack
more. The relative paucity of war theorizing in [feminist circles
outside IR]{.underline} is noteworthy. It also shows how far [women's
[studies]{.mark} as a field has [moved **away** from theories of
oppression that incorporated violent politics]{.mark} of
liberation]{.underline}: Marxist and radical schools of thought had many
adherents in North American and European feminist circles in the 1960s
and 1970s, as well as no-holds-barred spokeswomen who had little time
for liberal bourgeois feminism or breeder (heterosexual) social
arrangements (e.g., Davis, 1989; Daly, 1978).Today, [[violence]{.mark}
is seen as mostly [**inappropriate** to feminist political
ends]{.mark}]{.underline}.

New thinking in [[feminist IR]{.mark} complements feminist collections
but also departs from past and present feminist theorizing and from IR
theorizing]{.underline}. It does not focus on the USA as war central,
for example, or on wars traceable to 9/11 only; [nor]{.underline} does
it [[focus on **transnational feminist currents**]{.mark} of [response
to war]{.mark}]{.underline}, albeit elements of such themes do scatter
through the literature. Taking a wide geospatial view, post- Cold War
wars are seen as having many and varied authority centers at domestic,
regional, and international levels. The new work in [feminist IR war
[studies]{.mark}]{.underline} also looks more [closely at experiences of
ordinary people with war and [draws less on abstract]{.mark} theoretical
[explanations for war like]{.mark} globalization, militarization,
imperialism, capitalism, or **[patriarchy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It
[[contests]{.mark} feminist IR's [previously uncontested]{.mark}
[emphasis on peace]{.mark} and considers situations that [place women in
**grey zones**]{.mark} between war and peace, conflict and
post-conflict]{.underline}.

The [[new scholarship]{.underline}]{.mark} does [reflect]{.underline}
back [[on **feminist thinking**]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, by asking
[how [best]{.mark} to present [women's]{.mark} experiences of
war]{.underline}. Two related [types of
**[methodologies]{.mark}**]{.underline} have [[risen]{.mark} to the fore
in feminist IR]{.underline} [war research]{.underline} so far:
interviews, and **[[discourse analysis]{.underline}]{.mark}**, broadly
understood. Interview research enables the investigator to talk to the
subjects of war directly, often on their own turf. Annica Kronsell
(2006: 121) argues that "interviews are an important source of
information because they can provide an in-depth, [detailed
[account]{.mark} of how gendered [practices]{.mark}]{.underline} are
actually carried out [[within institutions]{.underline}]{.mark} as well
as of [how gendered identities are **constructed**]{.underline}." War
anthropologist Carolyn Nordstrom (1995: 139) suggests that interviews
enable a researcher to enter into the [realm of lived
experience]{.underline}, [which has been a **privileged location** for
feminist research]{.underline}; however, she points out that while local
knowledge is crucial to understanding,"quoting local informants can mean
a death sentence for them" (Nordstrom, 2004: 15), which suggests that
there are many hidden dangers in the approach. It has also been said
that traveling to the subjects of one's research is too often [idealized
as a purer way of doing feminist research than through other
methodologies]{.underline} (Stephens, 1989). Bina D'Costa (2006: 139)
offers a related concern when she notes that the [concept of experience
has not been critically analyzed in **development studies**]{.underline}
or in the context of research on women in the South, where many of the
new wars take place.

During the 128th Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly (March 22--27, 2013)
in Ecuador, parliamentarians from around the world stressed the need to
include women in politics. [[Syrian parliamentarian Maria Saadeh
contributed to]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[discussion]{.underline}
[by]{.underline}]{.mark} [explaining her motives to enter
politics]{.underline} [and]{.underline} her [[commitment to **political
reform**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

\* \* \*

I would like to share [my personal experience [as an **independent
Parliament member**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [an architect]{.underline},
[and a Syrian woman]{.underline}. I decided to run for Parliament during
a difficult period of the Syrian crisis because I believed in defending
my right and the right of the Syrian people to have freedom of
expression and the freedom to determine our destiny. This right has been
denied by some countries that claim to speak on behalf of our people
without considering the realities on the ground. These countries claim
to champion human rights and to support the Syrian people and their
freedoms. Instead, they have violated the sovereignty of the Syrian
state by manufacturing an external opposition of people who claim to be
the only legitimate representative of the Syrian public despite not
having lived in Syria for over twenty years. This opposition allegedly
wants to overthrow the current secular regime in order to institute
democracy. However, [[**freedom** and **democracy** cannot be achieved
through]{.mark} arming civilians]{.underline}, [using
**[intimidation]{.mark} tactics**]{.underline}, [dismissing and
[**disregarding** the **majority**]{.mark}'s opinion]{.underline},
[opening borders to global networks of
**[terrorists]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [spreading
**[sectarianism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [disseminating **false
[propaganda]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [or changing facts]{.underline} on
the ground.

As a patriotic Syrian Christian woman, I felt a strong responsibility to
mitigate the crisis in my country, as did many other Syrian women, who
have shown great resolve and endurance. Like many[, [I experienced the
**widespread corruption** in Syria]{.underline}, [but I
refused]{.underline}]{.mark} to let my emotions determine my reaction to
these conditions, as others have, or [[to ignite a war in my
country]{.underline}]{.mark}. Recognizing that the crisis is
quintessentially a national issue, I chose the Syrian Parliament as a
legitimate platform upon which to advocate for reform, defend the rights
of my people, and work for peace and true democracy in my country.

Through this international forum that advocates for democracy worldwide,
I stand today, along with every parliamentarian who was elected by the
public, to represent the Syrian people. Although the Syrian public did
not elect the opposition, Syria's doors are open to the internal and
external opposition groups if they wish to participate in its
governance. However, they must be elected if they wish to represent the
Syrian people[. [Those who want to **change** the
**system**]{.mark}]{.underline}, or even the regime, [**[must
provide]{.underline}** [a **clear** and **legitimate**
proposal]{.underline}]{.mark} [for reform [that can be supported at the
ballot]{.mark} and ensure that it does not advance foreign
agendas]{.underline}.

[[Legitimacy **cannot be won** through]{.mark} war, killing innocent
people, or [destroying the **state's infrastructure** under the pretext
of changing the regime]{.mark} or protecting civilians]{.underline}. As
a woman parliamentarian, I join you in assuming the responsibility for
protecting people's freedom and women's roles in politics and society. I
invite you to stand with the Syrian people in order to stop the violence
and work for peace in Syria and the Middle East. I reiterate our
rejection of any international intervention that ignores our role as
legitimately elected women parliamentarians, or that intervenes in our
affairs or the sovereignty of any other state.

Political Context of Bahrain

[["\[Bahraini women\] have been **shoulder-to-shoulder** with men
fighting the \[British\] occupation in the 1950s and
1960s]{.underline},]{.mark}" remarked a Bahraini activist and journalist
(personal interview, November 26, 2014, Houston, Texas). The period of
the 1950s witnessed the birth of a unique moment in Bahrain's history,
with the rise of a nonsectarian political movement challenging the
ruling power of Sheikh Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa and his British
advisor (Coates Ulrichsen 2013). Mounting discontent concerning British
policies in Bahrain and the sweeping Arab nationalism served as potent
catalysts to mobilize Bahrainis for a unified cause and eventually to
seek Bahrain's independence from Britain in 1971.

[[The newly formed government set]{.underline}]{.mark} in place a
constitution in 1973 that guaranteed [**[universal
suffrage]{.underline}**, [though it denied women the right to
vote]{.underline}]{.mark}. Women were viewed as a means to strengthen
the nation, and their education and participation in the country's
development were considered necessary elements for a modern state
following independence (Al Gharaibeh 2011, 96). From independence until
the turn of the century, however, women achieved minor advances in the
realm of formal politics, whereas women's education, economic
capability, and organization flourished (Pandya 2012; Seikaly 1994).

Between 1994 and 1999, political and social unrest rocked Bahrain once
again with the Uprising of Dignity, in which both liberals and Islamists
joined forces to demand employment opportunities, social justice,
democratic reforms, and a stronger role for the Parliament (Coates
Ulrichsen 2013; Seikaly 1997). Central to these demands were the
political rights and participation of women (Al Gharaibeh 2011, 97).
Indeed[, [women themselves **mobilized to fight** for their rights and
started a **petition** in 1995]{.underline}]{.mark} that articulated
their concerns about the state of Bahraini society and their desire for
concrete reforms that would include women in the political process
(Seikaly 1997, 125).

[[Protests erupted once again in 200]{.underline}1]{.mark}. In response,
a National Action Charter was proposed as an attempt to appease opposing
voices Women's Political Participation in Bahrain
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} make the government more responsive to
citizens and inclusive of women. Remarkably, it was the precursor to a
new constitution in 2002, which called for the establishment of
elections for [[the Parliament]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[gave women the
right to vote and **participate** in public affai]{.mark}r]{.underline}s
(Fadhl 2008). "The Bahraini women were participating in protests,
participating in life," remarked a member of the Gulf Center for Human
Rights (personal interview, December 3, 2014. Houston, Texas). A scholar
researching Bahrain at the time of the first elections reflected on that
historic moment, saying, "They were so excited to be able to actually
participate. It was the participation that got women charged up. And
that moved on to activism in other areas" (personal interview, December
3, 2014, Houston, Texas). While the National Action Charter and
universal suffrage opened doors in the formal political realm, women
continued to face challenges that curtailed their advancement.

[[In]{.mark} March [2021, a movement called **Feminist Rising**
**Against Feminicídio**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Feminist Rising,
hereafter) [[launched]{.mark} a collective [manifesto to
denounce]{.mark} the rise of lethal [violence against
women]{.mark}]{.underline} in Brazil.2 Feminicídio broadly names the
cases of lethal violence against those regarded as feminine and
feminized (Fregoso 2023), and Brazil criminalized it in 2015. The
Feminist Rising alliance, a national campaign formed by diverse
movements, organizations, and unions, stated that the practice of
feminicídio "has never been so blatant and extremist as it is now, in
the government of Jair Bolsonaro." By raising awareness and pointing out
the increase of feminicídio cases in the country, the campaign
emphasized the negligence of the state concerning violence against women
during the far-right government of Jair Bolsonaro. This movement was
forged six years after the Feminicídio Law (Law 13.104/2015) was
approved in Brazil, revealing the [[ongoing politicization toward the
category among Brazilian feminist]{.mark}]{.underline} communities
[[following]{.underline}]{.mark} its **[[state
incorporation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[The political
mobilization]{.underline}]{.mark} around feminicídio after its
criminalization included protests, petitions, and [[claims for **more
state resources** for welfare projects]{.underline}]{.mark}, presenting
a puzzle to narratives of depoliticization or co-optation of feminist
ideas on violence after they have been incorporated by the state
(Bumiller 2008; Halley et al. 2018).

[[Feminists have actively **engaged** with the **state** and its
ideological disputes]{.underline}]{.mark} (Gramsci 1971; Hall et al.
1996) [[to politicize and bring attention to acts of violence that were
previously not]{.mark} [considered public concerns]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Frazer and Hutchings 2020). In these disputes, studies have examined
how [[feminist ideas on violence are implemented by noting an alignment
with neoliberal]{.underline}]{.mark} agendas [[and conservative]{.mark}
[movements]{.mark}]{.underline} (Bernstein 2012; Bumiller 2008; Whittier
2018). Studies on the Global South have revealed a double-edged sword
for women's movements, as [[feminist politics through the
state]{.mark}]{.underline} can **[[strengthen
mobilizations]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the battle [[for
democracy]{.underline}]{.mark} (Youssef 2023) [[and allow for **new
interpretations** of the meanings of **violence**]{.underline}]{.mark}
(García-Del Moral 2016; Wright 2006). Activists are thus particularly
concerned about the outcomes of institutionalization for feminist
projects (Ferree and Martin 1995), considering contemporary critiques on
the depoliticization of feminism (Eschle and Maiguashca 2014) and the
rise of anti-feminist discourses (Krizsán and Roggeband 2021). Given
these contemporary apprehensions, feminist scholars have shown the need
for more contextual approaches to theorizing feminist politics and the
state (Lakkimsetti 2020; Orloff, Ray, and Savci 2016; Vijayakumar 2021),
focusing on how different contexts shape feminist political dynamics and
activism.

A third theme is that of active citizenship, of being part of a nation
that is struggling to find its way to make a state that will be free of
the autocracy, violence, oppressions and exclusions that their nations
have been experiencing. These voices say that openings for democracy are
pregnant with possibility for women, but these voices also tell of
dreadful abuses and both institutional violence and impunity. [[The
desire to be citizens with **full rights** to participation]{.underline}
[in determining the future of the state]{.underline}]{.mark} that will
govern them [[is articulated in]{.underline}]{.mark} so many different
forms, from the claim to [[legislative
representation]{.underline}]{.mark} in it to the resistance to violence
in the movements to overthrow it completely. Despite the downward
spirals into violence that have torn Syria and Iraq apart with such
deadly consequences, [[the ideal of citizenship]{.underline}]{.mark} as
respectful of difference and nonviolent in practice remains a commitment
that spans the full diversity of women's experiences with their states.

[[There is]{.mark}]{.underline} finally also [[a theme of
hope]{.underline}]{.mark}. By looking back on slow change and frequent
repression in the past, the stories here also [[point forward with hope
rather than resignation or despair]{.underline}]{.mark}. Whether the
account is of painfully slow reform processes in Saudi Arabia, or of the
destructive choice of the Syrian resistance to take up armed resistance,
or the civil war erupting in Yemen, the tragic implications are also
illuminated by the emphasis on how it could be otherwise someday.
Women's efforts to make reform are continuing even when the situation is
deteriorating. Hope is flower that appears in the form of graffiti
saying "no" to Syrian repression and to revolutionary violence.

The Arab Spring of 2011 is a decade in the past already, and many of the
authors are looking back from a place that they never anticipated being
in when they engaged in social movements in this period. The stories
offer not only accounts of the surprises that sometimes came next, for
example, in the form of repressive dictatorship in Egypt and wars in
Syria and Yemen, but also the ongoing developments in which the spring
of 2011 was merely a minor punctuation mark in a struggle for democracy
that began decades or more before and which is still being pursued
today. The results of these less glamourous transformations, as with
changes in the personal code that governs family relations, draw less
Western attention but are shown here as part of a diversity of changes
across the MENA region. Just as there was not one Arab Spring even
though revolutionary energies flowed across borders in the region a
decade ago, there is not one Arab winter now either, [[as women's
demands for **individual freedoms**, collective **recognition**,
democratic **influence** and a non-violent future]{.mark} also
[circulate]{.mark} and sustain [hope]{.mark}.]{.underline}

are made (Kosanic et al. 2022) and patriarchal communities have
perpetuated the effects of climate change amongst women. [[Climate
change also had an **adverse effect** on children and young
girls]{.underline}]{.mark} as they are prone to SGBV, while governments
apply gender-blind approaches (UNEP and UNDPPA 2020), which lead to new

structures on climate change, adaptation and mitigation interventions in

those in power. In view of the reviewed literature, it is obvious that
developing countries in the Global South are acting contrary to
international frameworks which propose the involvement of vulnerable
designated groups, including women and young girls, on the impacts of
climate change. The absence of policies as mandated by the UN through
their frameworks suggests that [[women]{.mark}]{.underline} will in the
foreseeable future [[still suffer from the **devastating effects** of
climate change]{.underline}]{.mark} as there is a lack of evidence to
show that the developing world adheres to the recommendations of the UN
frameworks.

Amongst the vulnerable populations, [[women are **severely impacted** by
climatic change]{.underline}]{.mark} and variations -- [rural
women]{.underline} who are mostly reliant on agriculture [are severely
affected]{.underline} (Brown et al. 2012). Rural women consider
agriculture their only security to sustain their poverty-stricken
livelihoods, families, and communities. In countries such as Bangladesh,
[[vulnerability to]{.mark} the devastating effects of [climate
change]{.mark}]{.underline} and income inequalities [[have **increased
food insecurity**]{.underline}]{.mark} (FAO 2015; Tanjeela and
Rutherford 2018). In Bangladesh, the climate victims are mostly women
who are poverty stricken. These [[women are more vulnerable than
men]{.mark} in both [rural and urban
situations]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} which are [[exacerbated by
**gender inequality**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and food insecurity has
shaped vulnerability and resilience amongst communities prone to
climate-induced disasters (Shamsuddoha 2012; Tanjeela and Rutherford
2018). According to Cutter (2017) and Watts et al. (2018), [[food
hierarchies]{.mark} have a likelihood to [make
women]{.mark}]{.underline} (possible when pregnant or breastfeeding)
[[and children susceptible to]{.mark} the increased **risks of
[malnutrition]{.mark}** [and water shortages]{.mark}]{.underline} during
and after disasters. Similarly, in the aftermath of disasters, women,
children, the elderly, and people with disabilities fnd it difcult to
bounce back because of income inequality and fnancial dependence. They
are usually unable to independently make decisions to migrate or stay in
areas which are struck by disasters (Jordan 2018; Ayeb-Karlsson et al.
2020).

According to Zaidi and Fordham (2021), the risks and vulnerabilities of
women due to disasters are perpetual in nature as they supersede various
interventions (including Fig. 1 Frequently occurring words. Sams (2019:
6) argues that in the [[patriarchal society]{.mark} of Bangladesh
amongst the climate migrants]{.underline}, the unequal socio-economic
conditions [[have **condemned women to poverty**]{.underline}]{.mark},
limited access to and control over natural resources, [[and a lower
status]{.mark} in the family and society]{.underline}, therefore
[[increasing]{.mark} their [vulnerability to
discrimination]{.mark}]{.underline}. Ayeb-Karlsson et al. (2020) opines
that when a disaster strikes, women's mobility tend to be at risk and
they are usually constrained to their homes as compared to their male
(masculine) counterparts who have the ability and fexibility to move.
Rhodes et al. (2010) opine that patriarchal power and socio-cultural
systems as well as the socio-political processes exacerbate gender
imbalances during and post disasters. Gender power relations and
imbalances are also experienced during capacity development regarding
disaster preparedness training (including early warning systems),
shelter for the displaced and social positions (Nadiruzzaman and
Wrathall 2015). In countries like Pakistan, the perceived norms, roles,
and responsibilities of women have generally placed them at a
disadvantaged position which make them vulnerable to climate induced
gender-based violence (Memon 2020).

Climate change and extreme weather events have laid bare major gender
inequalities as the marginalised sub-groups have minimal capacity to
adapt to climate change variations (Benjamin and Thomas 2020; Memon
2020) with excessive harassment recorded against women in Northern
Bangladesh (Masson et al. 2019). Gender disproportions have been notable
within rural populace as women are seen as more vulnerable to climate
change. This situation is a threat to human security and can have
devastating implications for agro-based livelihoods (Chidakwa et al.
2020). In Africa, countries such as Zimbabwe have experienced the
devastating impacts of climate change as women, children and the elderly
rely on rain-fed agriculture and are deeply vulnerable when their
agricultural production is drastically reduced because of urbanisation
and the emigration of their men to cities and neighbouring countries
(Chidakwa et al. 2020). A susceptibility to the efects of natural
disasters is also experienced by seasonal farmworkers and socially
isolated migrants and low-income people (Burke et al. 2012) with women
experiencing more violence than their male counterparts (Camey et al.
2020). Meanwhile, [[women are]{.mark} disproportionately [susceptible to
climate-induced disasters]{.mark} [especially]{.mark} those [in the
informal sector]{.mark} who are mostly seen as providing support to
their families and communities]{.underline} (Datey et al. 2023).

War, conflict, and crises introduce women and girls to a very real fear:
that their safety and human rights will be the last priority amid the
violence. The [[current war in Ukraine is widely expected to hurt
women]{.underline}]{.mark} and girls [[more than any other
population]{.underline}]{.mark}, both in the short and long term.

This is because the same has been true of almost all wars and conflicts
in history; it is also [[something we've seen in]{.underline}]{.mark}
violence that is currently ongoing in other parts of the world such as
the [[Sahel, Tigray,]{.underline}]{.mark} and
[[Afghanistan]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Simply because of their gender, [[women and girls caught in the middle
of war experience **sexual violence**]{.underline}]{.mark}, physical and
verbal [[**abuse**,]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[barriers in accessing
resources]{.underline}]{.mark} and having their human rights met; this
is of course all on top of being directly exposed to conflict on the
front lines [[and facing **life-threatening
conditions**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

In its entirety, [[war is an **enemy of progress** and threatens to
**increase extreme poverty** for people and
nations.]{.underline}]{.mark} Citizens flee their homes toward uncertain
displacement; food and other necessities for well-being become scarce;
economies face huge losses; and nations see the mass destruction of
infrastructure. You can learn more about how war drives poverty by
reading our explainer here.

However, [[women and girls face the worst of war and
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}, often being [[seen]{.underline}]{.mark}
not [[as]{.underline}]{.mark} the human beings they are, but as
**[[weapons of war]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- [[being]{.mark}
**horrifically [objectified]{.mark}**]{.underline} so that their needs,
emotions, and rights are unrecognisable to the perpetrators of violence.
This reality also deepens, for example, if they are members of the
LGBTQ+ community, or if they have a disability.

3 Things to Know About How War Impacts Women and Girls

The biggest risk they face is gender-based violence.
[[Women]{.underline}]{.mark} and girls [[are exposed to unprecedented
rates of]{.mark} sexual violence, abuse, and [torture in war
conditions]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Conflict enforces the objectification of [women]{.underline} and girls,
as they [are]{.underline} often [seen as weapons of war]{.underline},

control]{.underline}.

More than half of the world's conflict-related refugee population is
made up of women and children.

What Impact Does War Have on Women and Girls?

Women and girls have their health and safety, their human rights, and
their futures placed at unbelievable risk during conflict. The United
Nations' #EqualEverywhere campaign --- which was started to help promote
global gender equality --- identified a few main areas where women and
girls are most hurt by war. These include [[gender-based violence
(**GBV**), **displacement**, lack of access to **reproductive
health**]{.mark} [care, and **child marriage**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
[Girls' **education**]{.underline}]{.mark}, or lack thereof,
[[is]{.mark} also a significant way that women]{.underline} and girls
[are [impacted by conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### War Turns K\-\--1AR

[[War and GBV are **undeniably interlinked**]{.underline}]{.mark}, with
women and children being exposed to physical, verbal, sexual, and
psychological abuse in times of conflict. [[This form of violence
is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[used as a tool]{.mark}]{.underline} in
war [[to]{.mark} **assert [control]{.mark}**, [weaken families]{.mark},
carry out [ethnic cleansings]{.mark} and [genocide]{.mark}, and to
[discourage resistance and destabilise communitie]{.mark}s.]{.underline}

[[In Afghanistan]{.underline}]{.mark}, where the Taliban violently took
over the nation in 2021, women and girls were already exposed to GBV as
a by-product of the group's previous rule and violence experienced in
the nation. According to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) in 2020,
[[**87%** of women in Afghanistan had experienced]{.underline}]{.mark}
at least one form of [[GBV]{.underline},]{.mark} and
**[[62%]{.mark}]{.underline}** had [[experienced]{.mark} psychological,
physical, and sexual [abuse]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[[In Ethiopia]{.underline}]{.mark}'s Tigray region, where a war has been
ongoing since November 2020, [[violence]{.mark} against
women]{.underline} and girls has also [[included **torture**
and]{.underline}]{.mark} in some cases, resembled [**[sexual
slavery]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Amnesty International campaigner for the
Horn of Africa, Vanessa Tsehaye, told Global Citizen that
[[accounts]{.underline}]{.mark} and reports of GBV in Tigray [[included
"**brutality**]{.mark}, there were [beatings, torture,]{.mark} and
**[death threats]{.mark}**, [and ethnic slurs]{.mark} against the
Tigrayan women]{.underline}."

[[Women]{.mark} and girls are]{.underline} also [[not safe in refugee

living in humanitarian settings have [[experience]{.underline}]{.mark}d

Women often carry the responsibility of relocating families, protecting
livelihoods, and keeping everyone safe, and as a result [[it is mostly
women]{.mark}]{.underline} and children [[that can be found in refugee
camps]{.underline}.]{.mark} The UN Refugee Agency estimates that [[more
than half of]{.underline}]{.mark} the world's [[80 million displaced
people are women]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The UN also points out that [[conflict situations]{.underline}]{.mark}
have a tendency to [[reflect sexist gender norms]{.underline}]{.mark},
where women are expected to flee conflict, and men are expected to fight
on the front lines --- leading to a situation where women are
responsible for feeding, housing, and protecting their families.

Child Marriage

[[Child marriage is a by-product of war]{.mark}]{.underline} for a few
reasons; as war and conflict results in declining economies and disrupts
access to food, child marriage [[is seen as]{.underline} [a **desperate
solution** for]{.underline}]{.mark} financial [[stability for
families]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Countries in West and Central Africa have the [[highest rates of **child
marriage**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the world, and this [[can be
attributed to]{.underline}]{.mark} political, environmental, and
**[[economic instability]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the regions.

In fact, the three countries with the highest rates of child marriage in
the world --- Niger, Central African Republic, and Chad --- are all in
the Sahel region, where there is ongoing violence surrounding Lake Chad,
as well as extreme drought conditions. According to [[Global Partnership
for Education]{.underline}]{.mark}, this [[shows a correlation between
**humanitarian crises** and risks for women]{.underline}]{.mark} and
girls.

Child marriage also furthers control over a single gender in conflict
situations, similar to GBV, objectifying girls and using them as a
weapon of violence. For instance, when the Taliban took over Afghanistan
in 2021, there were immediate reports of Taliban leaders pulling
together all unmarried girls in Afghan villages and forcing them to
marry Taliban fighters.

[[Forced marriage also forms a]{.underline}]{.mark} direct
[[barrier]{.underline}]{.mark} between girls and their right [[to
**education**]{.underline}]{.mark}, as once they are married they're
expected to assume a domestic role, filling shoes they're way too young
to fill including childbirth, tending to the household, and feeding the
family. This [[stunts]{.mark} their [access to education]{.mark} and
limits their futures.]{.underline}

#### **[HEALTH CARE]{.underline}.**

Limited Access to Life-Saving Health Care

[[As violence and war leads to the destruction of]{.underline}]{.mark}
facilities and infrastructure, [[hospitals]{.underline}]{.mark} and
clinics are often demolished and [[access to **health care** can
become]{.underline}]{.mark} painfully
[**[limited]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Not to mention [[electricity, water,
sanitation]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [[supplies are
disrupted]{.underline}]{.mark}, meaning that health and sanitation are
inaccessible to those who need them most.

This puts women and girls at significant risk as, with a lack of sexual
and reproductive health care, there's a [[higher potential
for]{.underline}]{.mark} unintended [**[pregnancies]{.underline}** [as
well as]{.underline}]{.mark} the spread of [[**disease** and
**infection**]{.underline}]{.mark}. It also means that health services
following gender-based or sexual violence are mostly inaccessible.

According to the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), Yemen's infrastructure loss
as a result of war has led to just a handful of hospitals remaining,
only 20% of which are able to provide maternal and child health
services. As a result, [[a woman in Yemen dies in childbirth **every two
hours**]{.underline}]{.mark}, with the [[causes]{.underline}]{.mark}
almost [[always being preventable]{.underline}.]{.mark}

#### [EDUCATION]{.underline}.

[[In conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} and crisis, [[girls
are]{.underline}]{.mark} often [[the first to be **pulled out of
school**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the last to return. According to the
Global Partnership for Education, [[girls]{.mark}]{.underline} facing
conflict [[are **2.5 times** more likely]{.underline}]{.mark} to be out
of [school than boys]{.underline}, and are less likely to return
following a ceasefire.

[[Education]{.underline}]{.mark} can [[protect
girls]{.underline}]{.mark} from being in harm's way,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} also protects [[their
futures]{.underline}]{.mark}, keeping them from child marriage, domestic
responsibilities, and violence.

In times of war and conflict, education can be inaccessible as in some
cases, like in Tigray's ongoing war, schools are used as military bases.
In other cases, such as [[in Afghanistan]{.underline}, [**education**
for all girls is **prohibited** under]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[Taliban]{.underline}]{.mark}'s rule. The loss of girls' education to
war and conflict can be felt in regions for decades, and is a [**[direct
enemy]{.underline}** [of gender equality]{.underline}]{.mark}.

holistic well-being rather than narrow performance metrics (Hadi et al.,
2020). [These qualities are crucial in design, where [the goal should be
to create solutions that]{.mark} genuinely [meet]{.mark} [the needs
of]{.mark} diverse users and [communities]{.mark}]{.underline} while
uplifting the overall quality of life of every stakeholder involved. For
example, while designing the game Sahakarya, a game which teaches people
how to prepare for an impending flood and [build resilience for
themselves and how [to work collaboratively]{.mark} with the community
when the flood has hit, our design team focused on incorporating care,
cooperation, and community-building as core game mechanics.]{.underline}
The game demonstrates a sophisticated integration of feminine and
masculine design principles, creating a nuanced learning environment for
disaster preparedness. The feminine design principles manifest through:

[Standpoint feminism remains the approach that puts women front and
center for a change]{.underline} -- and I gulp in the sweet air around
that -- instead of dropping "her" in some back lot of social theory.
[Yet I am not convinced that once her raw experience is mediated by
feminism per se, it becomes what some standpointers claim of it -- the
preferred way of investigating the world]{.underline} (see Harding,
1991). I worry that [[well-intentioned feminist input]{.mark} actually
[leavens experience]{.mark} somewhat [by pulling from it some points and
leaving the rest]{.mark} to another social tradition to
retrieve.]{.underline} Also, [[does not the type of feminist standpoint
we bring affect the outcome?]{.mark} If I have a standpoint on
oppression because I am poor, how does it (does it?) come out
differently if mediated by sexual difference, Marxist, liberal, or
postmodernist feminism? Is a feminist mediation]{.underline} (and which
one?) [of a white middle-class woman's standpoint more error-free than a
postcolonial mediation?]{.underline} Am I wrongly posing what is by now
a strong multiculturally based feminist enterprise, in which we know
that "no single map or collection of them can perfectly reflect
'reality' " (Harding, 1998:190)? [[The location issue in
feminism]{.mark}, as Harding puts it, [is unstable, shifting, and widely
dispersed]{.mark}]{.underline} -- and that is one of its strengths and a
weakness as it meets up with a professional IR that is also moving. A
little more feminist IR/IR feminist theorizing would help overcome the
sense that standpoint thinking sets up simultaneously as Archimedean and
as relativist.

[If [standpoint is problematic]{.mark}, some postmodernist claims also
make me wonder.]{.underline} I watch millennial protests against the
World Bank, the World Trade Organization, and the IMF and notice that
the mostly young protesters who are interviewed do not equivocate or
present the ironic distance and ambivalences that we associate with
postmodern identities. They are out there in the streets the way
feminists were in the 1960s -- before we knew that problems of voice
arose when one screamed too loudly. This time the targets are
politics-appropriating corporate strategies, which protesters have
themselves experienced (Klein, 1999), globalization, and structural
adjustment policies that affect strangers in distant places. The
[protesters may have complex pictures in their minds of how development
capitalism works, but one does not see as much evidence of a postmodern
awareness that people everywhere have multiple identities and wishes
that cannot be "captured" en toto by "a" modern, western empathy (or
capitalism).]{.underline} In hippy garb of yesterday, they perform a
modern spectacle of protest in a transnational advocacy mode. Some
impress me; and yet [[I worry about all the standpoints that could not
get to the protests and also be heard]{.underline}]{.mark} (Scholte,
2000).

Other nettles. Zaki Laidi (1998:1) argues that we are in an era that has
no particular meaning: "Our feeling of an exceptionally strong change in
world order after the fall of the Berlin Wall is coupled with our
equally enormous inability to interpret it, to give it meaning. Though
all the upheavals we experience daily can have several meanings, nothing
indicates they have a meaning, if by meaning we imply the triple notion
of foundation, unity, and final goal." Yet late twentieth-century
international politics still display some foundational unities around
gender themes (which Laidi might have seen had he taken gender into
account). At the eve of the western millennium, an Air India plane sat
on a runway in southern Afghanistan awaiting some move that would end a
hijacking. As of old, many womenandchildren but few men had been allowed
off the plane. Bosnia in the 1990s re-presented the old spectacle of
rape as a military strategy. More recently, [women huddled in cold
cellars in Chechnya while men tried to fend off Russians in an exercise
as old as the hills -- valiant and futile -- rather than through new
politics (at least from what I could see).]{.underline} Whither the
falling apart of gender metanarratives, of war metanarratives in this
postmodern era? The forms and goals may change, but the gender
foundations and unities can remain unmoved -- and full of meaning. Put
differently, [[in some corners of i]{.mark}nternational
[r]{.mark}elations, ["women" remain]{.mark}s right where it has always
been sited -- [in alternating neglect and
atrocities]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Starting at a very young age, [[children are socialized into a
heteronormative culture]{.mark}, one [that]{.mark} puts a premium on
heterosexuality and [reinforces]{.mark} binary [understandings]{.mark}
of sexuality and gender identity]{.underline}. Heterosexuality is often
assumed, enforced, and rewarded at the personal, social, and
institutional levels (Meyers & Raymond, 2010; Wilkinson & Pearson,
2009). This heteronormativity, "the mundane, everyday ways that
heterosexuality is privileged and taken for granted" (Myers & Raymond,
2010, p.190) is socially constructed. [[This hegemonic]{.mark}, deeply
rooted, and pervasive [structure of our societies]{.mark} and cultures
[significantly influences dominant institutions]{.mark} such as family,
marriage, religion, and educational systems]{.underline} (Herz &
Johansson, 2015; Ward, 2009). Similarly, gender and gender norms are
dictated by societal understanding of a binary hierarchical construction
of man/woman, masculinity/femininity (Budgeon, 2014). While sexuality
and gender represent different social constructs, they are deeply
interconnected, and researchers have shown that traditional gender norms
and heterosexuality are learned very early in childhood (Myers &
Raymond, 2010). These [[hegemonic]{.mark} [practices]{.mark} and
reinforcement of [normative expressions]{.mark}]{.underline} of gender
and sexuality [[have negative effects on]{.mark} the [well-being]{.mark}
of those who don't identify as heterosexual]{.underline} (aka sexual
minority youth), including, but not limited to substance use,
psychological distress, depressive symptoms, low self-esteem, and poor
academic performance (Bauermeister et al., 2017; Hall & LaFrance, 2012;

### Fem IR Lit Bad

#### Feminist IR fails to adopt an intersectional approach, re-entrenching western hegemony

Rim **Affathe '24** \[Affathe holds a bachelor's degree in political
science and master's International Relations master's from Central
European University\] "The Feminist challenge to central concepts of
International Relations"
<https://www.politics4her.com/blog/the-feminist-challenge-to-central-concepts-of-international-relations-1#:~:text=In%20sum%2C%20Williams%20provides%20a,significant%20amount%20of%20criticism%20after>
//KKang

Furthermore, Williams points out that several studies demonstrated [that
women are not pacifists by nature, and people who believe in gender
equality (not necessarily women) are more favorable to the use of
diplomacy and compromise when it comes to conflict
resolution]{.underline}.9 These studies have also shown that countries
that have achieved high levels of gender equality have foreign policies
that are less violent and belligerent.10

In sum, Williams provides a general overview of the feminist critique of
mainstream IR theories. However, she did not suggest any solution to
include women in the IR theoretical and practical framework. She also
failed to assess and evaluate the contribution of feminism to IR
theories. Additionally, Williams and other [[**feminist IR scholars
consider** women a homogenous group without]{.mark} adopting [an
intersectional approach]{.mark} [and taking into consideration other
factors such as class, race, ethnicity, and sexual
orientatio]{.mark}]{.underline}[n]{.mark}. For this reason, it can be
argued that [[the fem]{.mark}inist [IR theory has failed women in the
global Sout]{.mark}h]{.underline}. Moreover, feminist IR [theories
received a significant amount of criticism after the framing of some
conflicts in the name of liberating women and saving them but in the
end[, it was just a language that was used to hide the real intentions,
**namely maintaining western hegemony**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
guaranteeing western interests in the Middle East. Williams failed to
acknowledge the criticism that feminists IR theories received.

#### Their [reductionist]{.underline} theory of power harms and ostracizes women -- silencing non -- "feminists"

Steans explains [postmodern feminism as that which challenges what is
called the Enlightenment project,]{.underline} which is seen to be
inherently oppressive through its manipulative use of the discourse of
universal reason and equality for the sake of power interests: The
Enlightenment has been presented as a period in which mankind has been
liberated from ignorance, the whole process of rational and scientific
discourse characteristic of the 'modern' age has been deeply entrenched
with bias and has excluded the experiences of many groups. Discourse,
which in simple terms means the language which is used to construct
social meaning and intersubjective understanding, is never innocent.
Those in positions of power are more likely to be heard. Their 'truths'
are more likely to be accepted. \[48\] [[Therefore, **simply placing
"woman**" in the place of man in world politics, showing how politics
looks from where "she" stands, **runs the risk of silencing** some women
whose experience conflicts **with
"hers.**]{.underline}**"\[**]{.mark}49\] By taking into account that
gender forms only part of the picture and that class, race, placement in
the international system, et cetera also are places wherein power
operates, feminists can be less likely to simplify the picture for the
sake of their own interests.[[The postmodern perspective is
controversial for its rejection of reason and emancipation for all
women.]{.mark} Whitworth, for example, takes the position that this
argument is politically paralyzing and irresponsible to the feminist
project]{.underline}.\[50\] Mainstream IR scholars, even those
sympathetic to feminist goals, are even more skeptical of a perspective
which rejects all objective bases for the truth of knowledge. Robert
Keohane, a prominent IR scholar, rejects such a position: "I object to
the notion that because social science cannot attain any perfectly
reliable knowledge, it is justifiable for students of society to
'obliterate the validity of reality.'"\[51\] While it is not my
intention to choose one best feminist position, it can certainly be
argued that the postmodernist critique of reason helps to shed some
light on the systems of thought in which masculinities are constructed

support the symposium editors\' attempt to broaden the standard
categories of international legal methodologies by including feminism in

my analysis and its unrepresen- tativeness-the particularity of my
nationality, race, class, sexuality, education and pro- fession shapes
my outlook and ideas on international law. I clearly cannot speak for
all women participants in and observers of the international legal
system. I also hope that one day I will stop being positioned always as
a feminist and will qualify as a fully fledged international lawyer. My
reservations are also more general because presenting [[feminism]{.mark}
as one of seven rival methodological traditions [may give a **false
sense** of its nature]{.mark}.]{.underline} The symposium editors\'
memorandum to the participants encouraged a certain competitive- ness:
we were asked, \"Why is your method better than others?\" I cannot
answer this question. I do not see feminist methods as ready
alternatives to any of the other methods represented in this symposium.

War and Conflict MERI Policy Brief 2016, vol. 3, no. 1 2 Historical Use
of Rape in Conflict In August 2015, the UN Security Council warned that,
in Iraq and Syria[, sexual violence is being used as a deliberate
tactic, saying these acts are war crimes,]{.underline} with claims that
Daesh (Islamic State) in particular has created a 'theology of rape'
including sexual slavery. But violence against women of this type is in
no way unique. Each situation is specific and it is important to use an
inter-sectional analysis and avoid generalisations. However, UN
estimates include: • [[**In Rwanda, up to 500,000 women** raped during
the 1994 genocide]{.mark}, in acts known as 'genocidal rape'. • In
Sierra Leone 60,000 women raped during the civil war from 1991-2002. •
[**In Liberia, 40,000** women raped and mutilate]{.mark}d (1989-2003). •
In Bosnia in Europe, 60,000 women raped (1992-1995). • In Democratic
Republic of the Congo, more than 200,000 women raped in a decade of
conflict.]{.underline} • High levels of sexual violence uncovered in
hidden conflicts (e.g. the previous struggles in Myanmar, Algeria).
Violated women have in such countries bravely given evidence in rape
trials in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and elsewhere, in which
they sometimes appeared completely covered in disguise since the rapists
would have been in the audience. Sexual Slavery In terms of taking
sexual slaves, Daesh is also not unique (although they are unusual in
that they cannot be shamed, but rather publicise these acts). There is
evidence of sexual slavery in Guatemala, Central America, in the 1980s,
and in the recent war in South Sudan. In Chad in October 2015, a rape
trial heard evidence from women taken as sexual slaves in the 1980s by
the army of the then-dictator, including from women as young as 13 at
the time and from others forced to watch the repeated rape of their
daughters. [[A further example is **the Comfort Women in Japan and Korea
in the 1940s**]{.mark} --- the use of women and girls abducted by force
and taken to be sexual slaves by Japan in WW2 in attacked
countries.]{.underline} Some of the women have now been able to speak
out after 70 year and at the very end of their lives, breaking their

spread of sexually transmitted infections and HIV, suicide and coerced
suicide (under pressure from husbands or community members), and the
rape of women displaced by war and without male protection, including in
refugee camps. Thus, conflict and extremist fundamentalist aggression,
as we are seeing in this region \[Middle East\], tend to breed further
violence and to affect relations in families negatively, so that the
tragedy of war gets played out -- like so many other injustices --- on
women's bodies into the future. [In the UN and Human Rights Watch
reports, the searing magnitude of what researchers saw included terrible
horrors: wombs punctured with guns, women's private parts torn apart
with glass and knives, pregnant women beaten mercilessly until they
miscarried, gang rapes and special rape camps, with women frequently
sold on from one man to another. The UN commission concluded: ["We saw

worse fate than death".**]{.mark}]{.underline}

How might a feminist international lawyer approach the specific question
of individual accountability for human rights abuses in armed conflict[?
There is considerable empir- ical evidence that women are affected by
armed conflict in ways that men are not]{.underline}.[35 **[The]{.mark}
[savagery]{.mark}** [of warfare seems closely linked to]{.mark} a wild
form of male sexuality, a type of \"[toxic]{.mark}

### Diplomacy

#### By emphasizing diplomacy, the aff embraces feminist IR approaches, rejecting hyper-masculine militarization

Ann E. **Towns** '**20**, \[Ann Towns is professor of political science
at the University of Gothenburg.\] \"'Diplomacy is a feminine art':
Feminised figurations of the diplomat\", Cambridge Core,
<https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/review-of-international-studies/article/diplomacy-is-a-feminine-art-feminised-figurations-of-the-diplomat/6841641FBBC87FAEDB7CA5AF28F045D8>
//KKang

However, as this article will argue and show through an analysis of US
policy discussions of diplomacy, while possibly dominant in many
contexts, masculinised representations of the diplomat and diplomacy are
contested and unstable. In US foreign policy discussions,
[[diplomacy]{.mark} is regularly [**differentiated** from the military
**as a 'soft' and putatively 'feminine'** alternative to military force.
]{.mark}]{.underline}[US]{.mark} [policymakers and political pundits
seeking to sideline diplomatic solutions recurrently disparage diplomacy
through [feminisation, drawing connections between **denigrated
allegedly 'feminine'** traits and diplomacy and diplomats. Not all
feminisation serves to downgrade diplomacy]{.mark},]{.underline}
however, as there are also appreciative depictions of diplomacy as a
'feminine' practice. Clare Boothe Luce, the first US woman appointed to
a major ambassadorial post abroad (Italy in 1953), contended that
'diplomacy is a feminine art' in order to legitimate her presence as a
woman in diplomacy.Footnote10 Similar claims have since been reproduced
by former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright [and a number of
[women diplomats and are currently repeated among some of those
advocating for larger numbers of women in
diplomacy]{.mark}.]{.underline} How, then, should we understand the
symbolic and rhetorical gendering of diplomacy and the diplomat?

Departing from Enloe\'s and Neumann\'s groundbreaking work on gender and
diplomacy, the aim of this article is to further interrogate the
symbolic figure of the diplomat and to complicate claims about how
gender is articulated. Virtually all contemporary feminist IR
scholarship approaches gender as relational and hierarchising processes.
However, there is some tension between analyses such as Enloe\'s and
Neumann\'s that aim to expose and analyse the (re)creation and
reification of predominant gender constructions and studies that aim to
unsettle such constructions by focusing on ambiguities and
indeterminacies of gender. Without seeking to resolve this tension --
there is great value in both approaches -- [[this article tends towards
the latter, aiming to display the multiple ways in which diplomacy and
**the diplomat** are also feminise]{.mark}d]{.underline}. To draw
attention to and critically examine complex and shifting gender
representations of 'the diplomat', I draw inspiration from Cynthia
Weber\'s recent elaboration of queer International Relations methods and
rely on the concept of figuration. Figurations are 'figures of speech',
schemes of representation in the form of characters or
subjectivities.Footnote11 I argue that the concept of figuration helps
draw attention not just to the plural character but also to the
continual refiguration and sometimes quickly changing representations of
figures central to international politics. Theoretical tools that are
attentive to potentially ambivalent, plural and shifting constructions
of gender help to answer the question of how diplomacy is gendered in
novel ways, I contend. Such tools are necessarily also attentive to the
intersectional character of gender and the ways in which, for example,
class, race, sexuality, and nationality help produce particular gendered
figurations.

More concretely, the analysis centres on representations of diplomacy
and figurations of the diplomat in US mainstream news media and
biographies of diplomats. Anna Agathangelou and L. H. M. [Ling have
connected the US militarised stance with masculinities, using the
concept of 'hypermasculinity' to]{.underline} describe the resurgence of
militarised self-representations in US discussions of foreign affairs
post-9/11.Footnote12 [**[Diplomacy may be particularly prone to
feminisation in such contexts of masculinised militarism]{.mark},**
making the contemporary US an interesting case to explore for those
interested in depictions of diplomacy.]{.underline} However, diplomacy
is a sited practice,Footnote13 situated and variable in its multiple
locations around the world. Whereas it is likely that other contexts
characterised by masculinised militarism also see feminised figurations
of the diplomat, I make no claims about the concrete form of those
feminised figurations. What the article provides with general
implications are theoretical tools for similar analyses in other
contexts, and the empirical findings can be used as a platform for
comparison across space and time.

### Russia dominance worse

#### Case turns the K --- absent deterrence, Russia weaponizes hegemonic masculinity to justify war and sexist oppression

**DomańSka '24**. \[Senior fellow at the Warsaw-based Centre for Eastern
Studies (OSW)\]. \"The unwomanly face of Putinism -- Riddle Russia.\"
Riddle Russia. <https://ridl.io/the-unwomanly-face-of-putinism> //KKang

[Russia will remain an aggressive, revanchist state as long as it
remains authoritarian]{.underline}. [Its political culture, which is
based on the idea of hegemonic masculinity]{.underline}, not only [leads
to]{.underline} oppression at home, but [also aggression
abroad]{.underline}. Feminist politics could break the patriarchal
paradigm that keeps the country on an authoritarian path.

Aggressive war as a product of Russian patriarchal culture

[The war against [Ukraine is the]{.mark} most brutal [emblem of a
patriarchal culture of violence that permeates]{.mark} the
[Russia]{.mark}n political system]{.underline}. Physical, psychological
and symbolic violence is part of the so-called traditional system of
values and gender roles that the state apparatus and the Orthodox Church
actively promote --- both in domestic and foreign policy. The militant
conservative [«[patriotism]{.mark}» [is]{.mark} extolled by top-level
officials, as well as [enshrined in]{.mark} [education]{.mark}
programmes, historical [propaganda,]{.mark} [and]{.mark} popular
[culture]{.mark}.]{.underline} The «patriotic» content, protected by the
ever harsher censorship, boils down to the cult of strongman rule, wars
and territorial conquests, hatred towards enemies, and the
romanticization of criminal «moral» codes. [At the same time,
[the]{.mark} Orthodox [Church]{.mark} has [sacralized the]{.mark}
aggressive [war against Ukraine]{.mark} and lobbies against legal
measures targeting the widespread domestic violence.]{.underline}

The systemic, state-sponsored [[violence]{.mark} and tolerance thereof
«[trickles down]{.mark}» [into society]{.mark}. People who suffer from
an agonising sense of injustice and lawlessness in their relationships
with state agencies and --- more importantly --- recognise that this
injustice cannot be remedied]{.underline}, often take out their
frustration on others. These may be vulnerable groups (women, children,
subordinates, patients in psychiatric hospitals) or people whom the
state vilifies as «enemies of the nation». In addition, historical
propaganda, great power rhetoric and geopolitical revanchism have for
decades compensated for the Russians' lack of political agency,
worsening economic difficulties and lack of future prospects.

[[Russia's political culture feeds on systemic]{.mark} inequalities,
oppression and [the cult of hegemonic]{.mark} [masculinity]{.mark},
[which]{.mark} often [turns into]{.mark} a cult of [militarism]{.mark}.
It is based on strict hierarchy, control from above and legitimization
through force. Aggressiveness, rivalry and dominance are valued and
usually combined with xenophobia, chauvinism, misogyny and
homophobia.]{.underline} Furthermore, the way in which the ruling elite
conducts politics largely corresponds to the leadership model that
prevails in the criminal world. It is based on intimidation,
demonstrations of strength, contempt for the weak and a willingness to
take revenge for real or perceived insults. [[This]{.mark} political
[culture prepared the Russian]{.mark} [population for war]{.mark},
enabled the rapid suppression of any major anti-war resistance, [and
normalised]{.mark} [war as]{.mark} a [natural]{.mark} condition of state
and society.]{.underline}

[[Under Putin]{.mark}'s regime[, war is]{.mark} not only a product of
patriarchy, but also [a pretext to legitimise]{.mark} the increasing
[oppression]{.mark} in the country]{.underline}. The severely restricted
access to resources, the mass violation of citizens' rights and freedoms
and stripping them of their political agency and representation are
intended to guarantee that the current leadership remains in power for
life.

Putin's neo-totalitarian project

[The Kremlin is pursuing the neo-totalitarian goal of deepening the
atomization of society and turning it into a homogeneous mass that
declaratively rallies around the head of state]{.underline}. It regards
civil society and other unauthorised horizontal ties based on trust and
grassroots cooperation as a political threat. To make people compliant,
the authorities resort to massive interference in citizens' private
lives, censorship, propaganda and indoctrination (via the media and the
education system), encourage Russians to denounce their fellow citizens
for «unorthodox» political views and portray Russia as a «besieged
fortress». [[The lack of confrontation]{.mark} [with the
totalitarian]{.mark} and imperial [past]{.mark} has [made it]{.mark}
[possible to]{.mark} whitewash and then [glorify]{.mark} the Soviet
apparatus of political [terror]{.mark}, while suppressing the memory of
its victims, and extol strong, even ruthless rulers as the unifying
force of the nation.]{.underline}

Within this model of domination, [[women are objectified]{.mark} and
expected to merely conform to «patriotic femininity», [their main
function]{.mark} [being to produce]{.mark} cannon [fodder]{.mark} for
future wars.]{.underline} The promotion of gender rights is presented by
the Kremlin as hostile to Russian civilization --- a tool of
anti-Russian cognitive warfare sponsored by the West. In 2023, the
government ramped up its efforts to seriously restrict women's
reproductive rights, leading to the ban on «childfree ideology» and
restricted access to abortions. In the name of fighting the moral decay
of the West and «Satanism», [the [LGBT+]{.mark} [communities were
outlawed]{.mark} as extremist]{.underline} (interestingly, the Supreme
Court also designated the feminization of language as one of the
«extremist» characteristics).

In this highly ideologized political environment, [[sexism goes]{.mark}
hand in hand [with]{.mark} «internal [colonialism]{.mark}».]{.underline}
Formally a federation, Russia is in reality a highly centralised state
in which the needs and interests of regions and local communities are
disregarded, their resources are plundered and discrimination against
non-Russian ethno-national groups is systemic. Russian citizenship
(российскость) is often equated with belonging to the Russian ethnos and
culture (русскость), while non-Russians make up at least 20 per cent of
the population. The languages of ethnic and national minorities are
downgraded in the education system, while their cultural heritage is
either ignored, turned into superficial folklore, or suppressed.
Ultimately, [the Kremlin replaces the historical memories of these
groups (often associated with mass terror and genocide orchestrated by
Moscow]{.underline}) with a distorted narrative of the «peaceful Russian
empire». In this context, the erasure of the identity of ethno-national
minorities has much in common with the officially declared goal to
«de-Ukrainize» Ukraine. Political, gender, linguistic and cultural
diversity is presented as a threat to the unity of the nation and
national security interests. In mid-2024, the non-existent «Anti-Russian
Separatist Movement» was banned as extremist in order to facilitate
repression against anti-colonial and indigenous activists.
