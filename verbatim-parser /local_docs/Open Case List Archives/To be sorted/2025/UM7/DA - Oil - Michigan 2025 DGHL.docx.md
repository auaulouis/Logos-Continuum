As Saudi Arabia marches toward its Vision 2030 goals, **[[2025 promises
to be]{.mark} another [transformative]{.mark} year [for the]{.mark}
Kingdom's [economy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. With [GDP projected to
grow]{.mark} by 3.7 percent, **[outpacing the global
average]{.underline}**, and [consumer spending]{.mark} forecasted [to
rise]{.mark} by 4.5 percent, [Saudi]{.mark} Arabia [remains a **[beacon
of economic resilience]{.underline}**]{.mark} and opportunity in a
shifting global landscape. Consumer price [inflation]{.mark}, projected
at a modest 2 percent, further [underscores]{.mark} the Kingdom's
**[[stable economic trajectory]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[Key drivers]{.mark} of this growth [include]{.mark} [robust]{.mark}
**[[non-oil economic activity]{.underline}]{.mark}**, fueled by
strategic investments in infrastructure, tourism, and technology. The
government's [focus on]{.mark} fostering a [diversified]{.mark} economy
**[[continues to bear fruit]{.underline}]{.mark}**, supported by
enabling policies, a growing private sector, and an increasingly dynamic
workforce that prominently includes women. Saudi Arabia's commitment to
sustainability, innovation, and inclusivity positions it as a regional
leader and **[[an attractive destination for global
investors]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

This article explores the Kingdom's economic outlook for 2025, delving
into the trends, opportunities, and challenges that will shape its
investment landscape. From the rise of the experience economy and
advancements in the payments sector to the evolving roles of migration
and gender equity in economic growth, Saudi Arabia is poised to solidify
its role as a key driver of regional and global economic expansion.

Saudi Arabia's economy in 2024

Saudi Arabia's economy in 2024 reflects a dynamic interplay between its
ambitious Vision 2030 reforms and the evolving global economic
landscape. Real GDP [growth]{.mark} has
**[[rebounded]{.underline}]{.mark}** following periods of contraction in
2020 and 2023, [underpinned by]{.mark} stable [non-oil]{.mark} economic
[activity]{.mark} **[[despite fluctuations in the oil
sector]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Non-oil GDP has exhibited consistent
growth over the past five years, [highlighting]{.mark} the Kingdom's
[efforts]{.mark} **[[to diversify]{.underline}]{.mark}** its economy
away from oil dependence. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's oil [breakeven
price,]{.mark} which has risen steadily in recent years, **[[is
projected to decline]{.underline}]{.mark}** [as fiscal policies become
more balanced]{.mark}.

[Inflation]{.mark} in the Kingdom **[[remains
subdued]{.underline}]{.mark}**, with the consumer price index showing
modest increases. However, government gross debt is expected to exceed
30 percent of GDP in 2025, signaling a cautious fiscal outlook. The
current account balance, which has faced pressure in recent years, is
projected to dip into a deficit, reflecting external trade dynamics.

[Trade]{.mark} activity in Saudi Arabia [has been a cornerstone
of]{.mark} its economic [recovery]{.mark} post-pandemic. While export
rates faced a significant decline in 2023, both imports and exports are
forecast to grow in 2025, albeit at a slower pace. The Kingdom's export
portfolio continues to be **[[dominated by oil]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
plastics, and organic chemicals, while its primary imports include
machinery, vehicles, and nuclear reactors. Saudi Arabia's top trade
partners remain strategically diverse, reinforcing its position as a key
player in regional and global commerce.

9\. Conclusions:

This paper discusses the impacts and the implications of low oil prices
on the regional stability and security [in the Gulf region]{.underline}.
As per theoretical related aspects, the paper has considered empirical
evidence that shows a correlation between [high oil prices]{.underline}
and inter-state conflict potential and instability. The paper has
focused on discussing how [Gulf countries]{.underline} have developed
their nation-building processes. They have evolved and developed by
considering the importance of engaging in integration processes which
would [ensure **domestic cohesion** and **regional security**. These
strategies have been **underpinned**]{.underline} and funded [by
**oil**]{.underline} revenues and these nations despite being aware of
their dependency on these resources have made little progress in
successfully diversifying their economies.

The [internal [stability in Gulf countries has been]{.mark}]{.underline}
equally [[funded]{.mark} by revenues [from oil by establishing a
**social contract**]{.mark} with the **aim**]{.underline}ing
[[of]{.mark} **[guaranteeing loyalty]{.mark}** to the
regime]{.underline} and a sense of belonging. Although important
episodes of low oil prices have challenged these economies in the past,
the radical changes that conduced to explosion of the Arab Spring and
the following aftermaths have added increasing quotas of uncertainty to
the entire economic, political, social and diplomatic ecosystem of the
Gulf.

The [Gulf [monarchies **pressed** by]{.mark} these
[societal]{.mark}]{.underline}, economic, cultural and political
[[forces]{.mark} have tried to mitigate their potential meltdown by
sponsoring and]{.underline} by [**[buy]{.mark}**ing]{.underline} with
high sums of money and resources [**[new loyalties]{.mark}**, new
balances [and]{.mark} **new [alliances]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In
parallel these economies have been investing massively in weaponry
considering the long-standing rivalries and conflicts with neighboring
countries such as Iran. This investment strategy has been spurred by
high oil prices between 2010 and 2014.

[From]{.underline} mid-[2014]{.underline} onwards, international [oil
prices plummeted and Gulf countries started to experience]{.underline}
fiscal [deficits which did not allow them to continue with their
generous subsidies and policies to ensure]{.underline} both
[domestic]{.underline} and international [security]{.underline} and
stability. Despite the negative economic and financial prospect, these
countries continued their policy of high investments on weaponry,
especially Saudi Arabia and Oman. Gulf countries challenged by an
international context where the disengagement of the US has been
progressive, had tried to rehearse new diplomatic, political and
economic formulas to allow them to progress as a Union, although lately
the GCC has been acting more as a Council undergoing several pressures
and transformations. A long-lasting context of sliding oil prices have
generated more regional atomization as Gulf states aim at maximizing,
individually or in coalition, their benefits within an environment of
latent conflict. In this vein, [[low oil prices]{.underline}]{.mark}
have [**[generated]{.mark} more [uncertainty]{.mark}** [and
**insecurity**]{.mark} in the entire region, **[endangering]{.mark}**
the continuity of the [**current regimes** and **boosting**]{.mark} the
potential for **[conflict]{.mark}** and instability.]{.underline}

Considering this scenario, and in accepting that the global oil demand
will diminish over the next years [[if Gulf states
**fail**]{.underline}]{.mark} in \[**[[to]{.underline}]{.mark}**\]
efficiently and sustainably **[[implement]{.underline}]{.mark}**
economic **[[diversification]{.underline}]{.mark}** policies, [the
**[collapse]{.mark}** of the gulf monarchies [will be a **matter of
time**]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, [[this]{.mark} process
of]{.underline} possible [**[meltdown]{.mark}** may entail]{.underline}
long processes of [readjustments and [will
**increase**]{.mark}]{.underline} the potential of **[[conflict and
instability across the]{.mark} entire [Mid]{.mark}]{.underline}**dle
**[[East]{.underline}]{.mark}**ern space.

ADA-337)

[In the event of contentious [anti-government
uprisings]{.mark}]{.underline}, [the [monarchy]{.mark} would [feel
pressured]{.mark}]{.underline} to offer change. The most likely scenario
would be the promotion of MBS, a reformer with a great deal of youth
support. This promotion is unlikely to quell elite resentment and could
further inflame tensions among the monarchy, rival family members, and
the religious establishment. If MBS offers liberal reforms, he would
likely lose the support of the ultra-conservative Wahhabi clerics. Yet
if he fails to provide reforms, resistance to the Saudi rulers could
grow based on regionalism and tribalism in the Hijaz, Nejd, or the
Eastern Province. Neither scenario bodes well for the monarchy. Though
he has a loyal following in the military, MBS's military excursion in
Yemen has received substantial criticism, creating the conditions for a
coup if destabilization escalates under his stewardship.

[Hostile **[elites]{.mark}** with competing clientele bases would see
**[state collapse]{.mark}** as an [opening for greater
**power**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since the kingdom's unification in 1932,
an overarching Saudi identity has been elusive. Saudi nationalism is a
new concept. The state has been united by the cooptation of elites and
the promotion of Wahhabi ideology, which while popular in the Nejd
heartland faces rejection from the country's Shi'ite minority. Not all
Saudi Sunnis, meanwhile, practice this branch of Sunni Islam.

[With an **[embattled]{.mark}**]{.underline} central
[[state]{.underline}]{.mark}, many [[tribal **elites**]{.mark} would
strive to [**carve** out]{.mark}]{.underline} autonomous
**[regions]{.mark}**, restore their pre-unification authority,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} potentially [**[dissolve]{.mark}** the
[modern Saudi]{.mark} state]{.underline}. To exert their power, these
tribal leaders would draw defections from tribal kin in the armed
forces. Disaffected royal family members with their own loyal bases of
support could also openly challenge King Salman's successor (whoever
that will be) if instability persists.

[In the face of [significant social upheaval]{.mark}]{.underline}, elite
abandonment, and military defection, the [[SANG]{.underline} [could
not]{.underline}]{.mark} realistically [[prevent]{.underline}]{.mark}
[the state from [sliding into civil war and
collapse]{.mark}]{.underline}. GCC states are aware of this scenario and
operational plans to contain this potential implosion are already under
consideration.

Consequences for Region and the World

The [**[collapse]{.underline}** [of the Saudi]{.underline}]{.mark}
[state would have [grave implication]{.mark}s for the]{.underline}
region and the **[world]{.underline}**. [[As illustrated by **Libya**,
**Syria**, and **Yemen**]{.underline}]{.mark}, state [collapse creates a
[vacuum for radical]{.mark}]{.underline} jihadist
[[groups]{.mark}]{.underline} to claim new territory. Currently,
al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ([AQAP]{.underline}) is pushing
against the Saudi border with Yemen and the Islamic State
([ISIS]{.underline} or IS) in Iraq and Syria poses a constant threat to
the kingdom's north. Thus, civil war, instability, and high levels of
sectarian tension would likely be fertile ground for these groups to
grow and expand their control, threaten the holy sites, and [perpetuate
regional instability]{.underline}. Washington's national security
establishment has expressed concerns about turmoil escalating in Saudi
Arabia if MBS's reform agenda fails to achieve its objectives. Some see
the kingdom at a crossroads and fear that the kingdom's collapse would
benefit the Islamic State. Regarding MBS possibly becoming the next
king, one anonymous Saudi expert told NBC News, "It's him or it's ISIS."

The July 4 attacks in three Saudi cities (Medina, Jeddah, and Qatif)
underscored the significance of the militant Salafist-Jihadist threat
not only to the country's security but also Al Saud's prestige and
Islamic legitimacy as the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. The
intended attack by IS adherents on the Prophet's Mosque during the end
of Ramadan signals the Islamic State's intent to usurp the Al Saud much
as the apocalyptic leader Juhayman al-Otaybi did when he seized the
Grand Mosque in 1979. "This attack has made it very clear that ISIS does
not seem to believe in any moral red lines whatsoever," said Fahad
Nazer, a leading expert on Saudi Arabia. "Even al-Qaeda, which is
certainly brutal in its own right, has never targeted Muslims in their
houses of worship. ISIS has done that repeatedly."

[[A **civil war**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Arabian Peninsula
[would]{.underline} also [[challenge]{.underline}]{.mark} long-standing
**[[alliances]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Instability, the threat to the
holy cities, and the possibility of jihadist gains would
[[encourage]{.underline}]{.mark} states with high stakes [[(**Egypt**,
**Jordan**, **Iran**, **Pakistan**, **U.S.**, etc.) to
**react**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In fact, UAE officials have even made
contingency plans for a potential state collapse in Saudi Arabia, a risk
which none of the kingdom's neighbors can afford to ignore. These states
would certainly move to secure the holy sites and combat terror cells,
but solving the civil war would be a massive challenge. There would be
considerable pressure to support the Saud family, but supporting the
Wahhabi religious establishment over a reform movement would cause
domestic complications in some of these countries that resent the
kingdom's influence across the region.

[[Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark}, [which has a "special]{.underline}
bilateral [[relationship]{.underline}]{.mark}" with Saudi Arabia
**[[obligating]{.underline}]{.mark}** [their military [to defend Mecca
and Medina]{.mark}]{.underline} and protect Saudi Arabia's territorial
integrity, [would]{.underline} [face]{.underline} the most pressure to
[[intervene **militarily**]{.underline}]{.mark} on behalf of the Saud
government should turmoil intensify. The two nations have a long history
of military and security cooperation, and there is little doubt that
Pakistan would act to protect the Al Saud rulers. In addition, the
Egyptian military is present in the northern border areas of Saudi
Arabia helping to augment Pakistani forces supporting SANG and the Saudi
border guard.

Iran and Oil

[The [geopolitical tsunami]{.mark}]{.underline} that would result from
Saudi Arabia's collapse [would]{.underline} [have [enormous consequences
regarding Iranian influence]{.mark}]{.underline} across the region. From
Iraq to Lebanon, and from Yemen to Syria, the struggle on the part of
hardline Sunni Islamists to counter Shi'ism and [[**Iran**'s]{.mark}
reach would [enter a **new phase**]{.mark}]{.underline} should Saudi
Arabia cease to exist as a unified nation-state. It is not entirely
clear how Iran would react to state-collapse in Saudi Arabia, especially
considering [[instability]{.underline}]{.mark} in the region [would
present [a **security risk** to shipping]{.mark}]{.underline} and trade
in the Persian Gulf. Although Iran would likely avoid direct involvement
in a conflict in the Arabian Peninsula, it would certainly attempt to
capitalize on a regional power vacuum created by a diminished Saudi
Arabia by consolidating its political and military influence in Yemen,
Iraq, Syria, Eastern Saudi Arabia, and, if instability spreads,
Shi'ite-majority Bahrain. [[Diminished oil output]{.underline}]{.mark}
by its regional rival [would]{.underline} also
[[increase]{.underline}]{.mark} [[demand]{.underline} [for Iranian
oil]{.underline}]{.mark}, [boosting their economy]{.underline}. There is
also no clear Sunni successor state to check Iran's regional influence.
Egypt's economy is too weak, and Jordan is surrounded on all sides by
instability.

Finally, [[Saudi]{.mark} Arabia [as a **failed state**]{.mark} would
send international [markets into free fall]{.mark}]{.underline}. State
collapse in Saudi Arabia would halt oil production, significantly
increasing the price of oil and dramatically weakening global economies.
Such an increase would [[spark a severe]{.mark}]{.underline} global
**[[economic crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The longer Saudi Arabia is
destabilized, the more difficult it would be for the world to pull out
of the crisis and recover. The socio-political ramifications of such an
economic shock could [be **[catastrophic]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
disastrous [[for]{.mark}]{.underline} both the region and [[the
**world**]{.underline}]{.mark}. If the government faces large-scale
demonstrations calling for social and political liberalization while
facing tribal, familial, and religious elite abandonment, the result
could be instability, civil war, and/or state collapse.

### 1NC -- Middle East

#### Oil demand will remain high for forseeable future

[[Exxon]{.underline}]{.mark} Mobil (XOM.N), said on Monday it
[[expects]{.mark} crude [demand]{.mark} to [stay above 100 million
barrels per day]{.mark}]{.underline} (bpd) [[through 2050]{.mark},
[similar to today\'s level]{.mark}s]{.underline}, a forecast 25% higher
than top European rival BP (BP.L), opens new tab.

[The stronger [demand]{.mark}]{.underline}, projected by the largest
U.S. oil company in its latest global oil outlook [[underpins Exxon\'s
production]{.mark} growth [plans]{.mark},]{.underline} the most
ambitious among Western oil majors. It did not have a 2050 demand figure
in its previous outlook released in 2023.

[The [company]{.mark} [also painted a more somber view]{.mark} on global
[carbon]{.mark} emissions [reductions]{.mark}]{.underline} than BP.
Advancements in technology will allow for emissions reductions after
2029, compared to the middle of this decade according to BP.

Exxon plans to pump 4.3 million barrels of oil and gas per day this
year, 30% more than U.S. top rival Chevron\'s (CVX.N), opens new tab
current output. BP is cutting production to about 2 million barrels per
day by 2030.

\"[[Oil and gas demand]{.mark} have a very, very long runway and [will
continue to grow]{.mark} over the next few years]{.underline},\" Exxon
Economics, Energy and Strategic Planning Director Chris Birdsall told
Reuters.

Exxon estimates [[e]{.mark}lectric [v]{.mark}ehicles will [not
significantly alter]{.mark} long-term global oil
[demand]{.mark}]{.underline}, as the world\'s population is expected to
increase from 8 billion today to nearly 10 billion in 2050, adding to
demand for energy.

If every new car sold in the world in 2035 were electric, crude oil
demand would still be 85 million bpd, the same it was in 2010, it said.
BP projects oil consumption will peak in 2025 and decline to 75 million
bpd in 2050.

The estimates are more than triple the 24 million bpd of crude the
International Energy Agency (IEA) says would allow the world to reach
net-zero emissions by 2050.

Exxon projects [[67%]{.mark} of the global [energy mix in 2050]{.mark}
will be [supplied by oil, natural gas and coa]{.mark}l]{.underline},
down from 68% last year.

Foreign Relations and David Jalilvand; a managing director of
Berlin-based Orient Matters; "Plunge in Oil Prices Could Shake Up Middle
East, Russia"; *VoA*;
https://www.voanews.com/economy-business/plunge-oil-prices-could-shake-middle-east-russia\]

The [[**collapse** in oil prices]{.underline}]{.mark} has created a
bleak outlook for a number of companies and also [[could lead to
dire]{.mark} political [consequences]{.mark} for governments [in the
Middle East]{.mark} and Russia[, whose budgets are]{.mark} already
[**strained** and who **depend** on fossil fuel]{.mark}
**[revenue]{.mark}**]{.underline}, say Western diplomats and political
analysts.

[If oil [prices do not **recover**]{.mark} soon]{.underline}, analysts
warn, [even strong central [powers **risk
destabilization**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[The drop in prices]{.mark} comes at a difficult time]{.underline} for
many governments in the Middle East. According to Julien Barnes-Dacey of
the European Council on Foreign Relations, the coronavirus is "just one
crisis on top of multiple crises --- economic, political, conflict ---
and [it]{.underline} raises the question: 'Is this just one other
element [that [pushes the region over the
**edge**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline}' particularly if you put it beside
the collapse in oil prices, which has gutted the finances of Saudi
Arabia and Iraq."

Their one hope is that economic recovery is swift after the pandemic
ends and demand for oil mounts quickly, outstripping supply and sending
prices soaring. But working through the stockpiles will take time, and
demand will likely be subdued as the world works through a global
recession.

"Demand will remain subdued for an extended period," the independent
Rystad Energy said.

"The price plunge will result in a huge loss of revenue for oil and gas
producers," said David Jalilvand, managing director of Berlin-based
Orient Matters. "Most of them have already been accumulating fiscal
deficits, which are now set to widen substantially," he noted in an
online commentary before oil prices turned negative.

[[The collapse will add to]{.mark} "a significant economic
[deterioration]{.mark} right [across the Middle East
and]{.mark}]{.underline} may well [aggravate]{.underline} already
[mounting [geopolitical **tensions**]{.mark} in the Gulf]{.underline},"
Jalilvand warned.

Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates may be able to tap into cash
reserves and borrow from international capital markets to cushion the
blow in the short term, but others, like Iran, already squeezed by U.S.
sanctions, and Iraq, won't have that option, he added.

Iraq and Iran

[Oil]{.underline} revenue [generated]{.underline} around [95% of the
Iraqi government's budget last year]{.underline}. [A budgetary crisis
will]{.underline} make it difficult for it to pay the salaries of public
servants and the army, as well as Shi'ite militias. It will also
[compound]{.underline} the [difficulties Iraq was having]{.underline} in
providing basic public services such as power and health care, analysts
say.

Even before the coronavirus appeared, the country was immersed in
political crisis. [[Cuts in **social spending** will]{.mark} only
[aggravate]{.mark} [political **stability**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Iran's gross domestic product contracted last year by around 9.5%, and
runaway inflation of 35% has eroded the purchasing power of ordinary
Iranians. While only 30% of the government's budget comes from oil
revenue, [[Tehran has little **financial** room]{.mark} to
maneuver]{.underline} and will also have difficulty paying for social
spending --- risking further unrest in a country that has experienced
rising public anger.

Saudi Arabia

[Other [Middle East countries could see major]{.mark} political
[**ramifications,** including Saudi Arabia]{.mark}]{.underline}, where
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is looking to consolidate his hold on
power.

The preeminent Gulf kingdom has a widening fiscal deficit and shrinking
reserves, and Salman's plans for economic transformation risk being
upended by budget cuts, as government revenue falls because of the
pandemic and plummeting energy prices.

In recent months, there has been mounting behind-the-scenes criticism of
Salman from members of the royal family who have been marginalized in
his rise to power. Last month, there were unconfirmed reports that
Salman thwarted an attempted palace coup.

I do not wish to say that Iran's present government is without serious
faults. However, any use of violence against Iran would be both
~~insane~~ and criminal. Why ~~insane~~? Because the present economy of
the US and the world cannot support another large-scale conflict;
because [[the **Mid**]{.mark}dle **[East]{.mark}**]{.underline} is
already a deeply troubled region; and because it is impossible to
predict the extent of [a war]{.underline} which, if [once started,
[might develop into **World War III**]{.mark}]{.underline}, given the
fact that Iran is closely allied with both Russia and China. Why
criminal? Because such violence would violate both the UN Charter and
the Nuremberg Principles. There is no hope at all for the future unless
we work for a peaceful world, governed by international law, rather than
a fearful world, where brutal power holds sway.

An attack on Iran could escalate

We recently passed the 100th anniversary World War I, and we should
remember that this colossal disaster escalated uncontrollably from what
was intended to be a minor conflict. There is a danger that an attack on
Iran would escalate into a large-scale war in the Middle East, entirely
destabilizing a region that is already deep in problems.

[The]{.underline} unstable [government of [Pakistan might be
**overthrown**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} the revolutionary
Pakistani government might [enter the war]{.mark} on the side of Iran,
thus **[introducing nuc]{.mark}**lear weapon**[s]{.mark}** into the
conflict. [Russia and China]{.mark}, firm allies of Iran, [might]{.mark}
also [be **drawn into a general war**]{.mark} in the Middle
East.]{.underline}

In the dangerous situation that could potentially result from an attack
on Iran, there is a risk that [**[nuc]{.mark}**lear weapon[**s** would
be used]{.mark}, either [intentionally]{.mark}, [or by **accident** or
**miscalc**]{.mark}ulation]{.underline}. Recent research has shown that
besides [[making]{.mark} large areas of [the world
**uninhabitable**]{.mark}]{.underline} through long-lasting radioactive
contamination[, a nuclear war would damage global agriculture to such a
extent that [a **global famine**]{.mark} of previously **unknown
proportions** would result.]{.underline}

Thus, [nuclear war is the ultimate ecological catastrophe. It [could
**destroy**]{.mark} **human [civilization]{.mark}** and much of the
**biosphere**.]{.underline} To risk such a war would be an unforgivable
offense against the lives and future of all the peoples of the world, US
citizens included.

Recent research has shown that [**thick [clouds of smoke]{.mark}** from
firestorms in burning cities would rise to the stratosphere, where they
[would **spread globally**]{.mark} and remain for a
**decade**,]{.underline} blocking the hydrological cycle, [and
**[destroying]{.mark} the [ozone]{.mark} layer**]{.underline}. [[A

[has]{.mark} dramatically **[[accelerated]{.underline}]{.mark}** since
**[2022]{.underline}**, [with **[the current investment
boom]{.underline}** representing a]{.mark} classic "Big
**[[Push]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [towards
**[diversification]{.underline}**]{.mark}. **[Gigascale
[infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline}** investments [are complemented
by]{.mark} [**[industrial policies]{.underline}** focused on
**[renewable energy]{.underline}**]{.mark}, refining, chemical
production, and the Kingdom's abundance of natural resources beyond oil,
while sweeping social, regulatory and legal reforms target high-value
service sectors, notably tourism, technology and financial services.
Recently, the PIF has accelerated **[venture]{.underline}**-style
**[investments]{.underline}** in **[[biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
artificial intelligence (**[[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}**), consumer
services [and]{.mark} automated **[[manufacturing]{.underline}]{.mark}**
-- underlined by the establishment of a \$40bn to \$100bn fund focused
on AI investment, which would make the Kingdom a
**[dominant]{.underline}** global investor in this area.

While much about Vision 2030 is pioneering and historic, the Big Push
approach to public investment has been a recurring feature in the
history of commodity-dependent economies. In the Middle East,
**[sustained commodity windfalls]{.underline}** have historically been
accompanied by sharp increases in public investment to
**[break]{.underline}** the region's historical **[oil
dependence]{.underline}**. Based on seminal work by Rosenstein-Rodan
(1943) and later by Murphy, Shleifer and Vishny (1989), Easterly (2006)
defines a Big Push as the "simultaneous increase in investment in many
different sectors, as well as a package of complementary policy changes
and technical interventions", coupled with "a national plan and
administrative apparatus to direct the investments, technical
interventions, and policy changes."

The long-term challenge of diversifying the Saudi economy, however,
means that the Big Push will inevitably evolve into a "Long Push",
**[extend]{.underline}**ing well **[beyond 2030]{.underline}**.
Successful diversification strategies involve generational policy and
capital commitments due to the gradual cultivation of comparative
advantages. In two recent papers, Alsweilem, Cader and Rietveld (2023a
and 2023b) apply the lens of Economic Fitness to the challenge of
designing diversification strategies, industrial policy and SWF/SDF
investment programs. This approach captures the diversity of an
economy's productive capabilities and its ability to produce complex
products. Productive capabilities, mapped using disaggregated export
data, are determined by the level of human and physical capital,
intellectual property, quality of institutions, infrastructure, skills
and technical know-how. Particularly when starting from initial
conditions of a narrow industrial base, relatively expensive input costs
and high oil dependence, the pursuit of diversification through
increased economic fitness is a deeply strategic, long-term undertaking.

[The Saudi advantage is an ability to **[harness]{.underline}**]{.mark}
large [**[oil revenues]{.underline}** for]{.mark} **[sustained [public
investment]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The inevitable extension of the
ambitious timeline of Vision 2030 will therefore be a positive
development, but one that **[requires]{.underline}** economic resilience
across and beyond the **[oil-revenue]{.underline}** cycle. The
**[current level]{.underline}** of [public investment can be
**[accommodated]{.underline}** by]{.mark} oil [revenues associated
with]{.mark} the US**[\$[75]{.mark}]{.underline}**-85 per barrel
oil-price range that has prevailed since the second half of 2022,
coupled with limited use of debt financing started from a low level of
overall indebtedness.

\[\[FIGURE OMITTED\]\]

At the same time, under the current policy mix, the prevailing
oil-revenue levels will not accommodate rebuilding of foreign-asset
pools that were significantly drawn upon following the post-2014 shock.
Indeed, the increase in public and PIF investment since 2022 has been
accompanied by an increase in new external-debt issuance, rather than
the accumulation of net foreign assets (see Figure 1). Concurrently, the
PIF has outlined the need to increase new capital deployments to around
US\$70bn per year from the current range of US\$40bn to US\$50bn to
continue meeting its Vision 2030 targets.1

Resilience across the oil-revenue cycle requires rebuilding and growing
a foreign-asset portfolio that will diversify Saudi Arabia's wealth and
income sources. Access to stable and sustainable streams of foreign
income is of **[critical]{.underline}** importance to the resilience of
the **[Saudi econ]{.underline}**omy, as this foreign income finances the
import of most consumer goods, from cars to food, medical supplies,
clothing, technological and household appliances, and essential
services. Moreover, [in]{.mark} the context of
**[[Vision]{.underline}]{.mark}** 2030, [**[foreign
income]{.underline}** is **[needed to pay]{.underline}** for]{.mark} the
importing of most **[[intermediate goods]{.underline}]{.mark}** --
**[[capital]{.underline}]{.mark}** goods,
**[[machinery]{.underline}]{.mark}**, raw materials, chemicals, [and
**[services]{.underline}**]{.mark} -- **[associated with]{.underline}**
large-scale infrastructure and megaproject investments. Finally,
preserving external balance in the context of rising imports is critical
to macroeconomic stability and resilience, given the fixed exchange rate
between the Saudi Riyal and US dollar.

Historically, [oil]{.mark} exports [have been the]{.mark}
**[near-[exclusive]{.mark}]{.underline}** [source of]{.mark} **[fiscal
revenue]{.underline}** and hard-**[currency
[earnings]{.mark}]{.underline}** through which to pay for imports and
manage the fixed exchange rate. Thus, income from the foreign assets can
play a critical role in supplementing oil revenue in funding the
sustained domestic-investment push (the Long Push) set in motion by
Vision 2030. Below, we consider policy options that will promote the
build-up of income-generating foreign assets, but first it is
instructive to summarize the most salient fiscal reforms that have
occurred in Saudi Arabia over the past decade.

II\. Petrodollars to Petroriyals:

The PIF's Innovative Diversification Mandate

The collapse in oil prices in the second half of 2014 resulted in
several important policy reforms in Saudi Arabia. The most profound
shift was around the balance between foreign and domestic asset
accumulation. Since that time, the Public Investment Fund (PIF) has
become the primary instrument through which oil revenues are
intermediated towards large-scale public investments associated with
Vision 2030. This represents a historic break with the so-called
petrodollar recycling model, which has been a prominent feature of the
macroeconomic management of Gulf states since the 1970s.

According to the petrodollar recycling model (Caballero, Farhi and
Gourinchas, 2008), oil-price spikes historically boosted oil exporters'
incomes by more than the demand for spending and domestic investment,
leading to higher savings and current-account surpluses. Historically,
these surpluses were largely "recycled" into dollar and other
reserve-currency assets (and, after the Global Financial Crisis in 2008,
into increasingly diversified foreign assets through rapidly growing
SWFs) -- hence the term "petrodollar recycling".

In recent years, the petrodollar-recycling pattern has already been
fundamentally upended -- not just in Saudi Arabia, but across the Gulf
states. Surplus assets that were historically mainly accumulated through
foreign-exchange reserves held by the Saudi Arabian central bank, have
declined since 2014. There are many reasons for this shift, including
demographic trends, higher per capita domestic spending needs leading to
smaller fiscal surpluses for a given oil price, and a growing appetite
for less-liquid and higher-risk assets. But the most significant factor
has been the PIF's Big Push into domestic investments, which is now
evolving into an innovative model for institutional investment:
achieving high performance through economic diversification. The net
effect has been the relative shift away from the accumulation of foreign
assets in favor of long-term investments in local currency, with the PIF
taking center stage in the Big Push for the diversification and
modernization of the Saudi economy. In effect, surpluses are
increasingly held in the form of "petroriyals", rather than
petrodollars.

If this proves to be a permanent structural break it will have profound
implications for Saudi Arabia's macroeconomic and fiscal policy. The
Kingdom's ability to draw on foreign-exchange reserves to stabilize
public spending and investment, while managing the fixed exchange rate
in the event of a negative oil-revenue shock has already declined, given
the reduction from US\$750bn before the 2014 shock to the current level
of US\$450bn (according to official data from SAMA); while imports,
government spending and the PIF's capital deployments have increased
considerably.

While this domestic focus has already delivered impressive results and
brought about a much-needed focus on long-term investment over
short-term consumption, we argue that foreign assets and income remain
vital to Saudi Arabia, not least due to large-scale infrastructure and
megaproject investments which require significant intermediate capital
goods and services from abroad. While there is increased appetite for
resorting to debt financing, non-oil revenues and privatization
proceeds, it is inevitable that **[non-oil revenue
sources]{.underline}** and **[debt-service costs]{.underline}** will be
correlated with oil revenues. The cost of adjustment through these
channels will, therefore, also **[rise]{.underline}** during a
**[negative oil-revenue shock]{.underline}**. The primary risk stemming
from the post-2014 emphasis on domestic investment over foreign-asset
accumulation, therefore, is that it could make Saudi Arabia more
dependent on oil revenue for fiscal and external stability.

As we explain in greater detail below, an important long-term objective
should be to continue **[[diversifying]{.underline}]{.mark}** sources of
**[public revenue]{.underline}**, so that it is balanced across oil,
mining, sales taxes, tourism, debt financing, and -- as we argue for in
this paper -- financial income on both domestic and foreign assets. This
portfolio of revenue sources will feature a mix of uncorrelated revenue
streams and combine local- and foreign-currency income. As the Big Push
evolves into the Long Push, this [will **[enable]{.underline}**
Saudi]{.mark} Arabia [to]{.mark} **[sustain spending]{.underline}** and
investment across the oil-revenue cycle -- and help [prepare for
a]{.mark}n eventual **[[post-oil future]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

III\. Progress on Reducing Oil Dependence:

Revenue Diversification, but Rising Break-Evens

Historically, even when oil prices have fallen sharply (as in 2009 and
2014), oil's share of total revenue in Saudi Arabia has remained above
85%, given the lack of non-oil tax revenue -- and, hence, such shocks
had to be met with sharp, procyclical cuts in public spending and
investment. The landmark introduction of a VAT sales tax in the
aftermath of the 2014 oil shock, however, initiated a structural shift
that resulted in non-oil revenues growing steadily ever since. Saudi
Arabia also engaged in successful debt issuances, including foreign
borrowing in the aftermath of the 2014 oil price shock.

These developments mean that Saudi Arabia's portfolio of revenue sources
is now more diversified than before the 2014 shock (see Figure 2). This
diversification is **[evident]{.underline}** both in the total size of
**[non-oil revenues annually]{.underline}** and the fact that oil's
share of total revenue has remained **[below 70%]{.underline}**, even
during the large windfall in 2022.

\[\[FIGURE OMITTED\]\]

A common rule of thumb for assessing fiscal dependence on oil is to
estimate the average price per barrel required to balance the budget for
assumed levels of spending and oil production. Such fiscal "break-even
price" estimates either assume real spending, non-oil revenues, and
production volumes to be constant or following a steady growth path. In
the Saudi case, production volumes are well anchored given its
leadership role in OPEC, which means output typically fluctuates in a
range of 9 million to 11 million barrels a day (on rare occasions
widening to 8 million to 12 million barrels per day). Further, non-oil
revenues can be assumed to increase steadily, while spending growth can
be linked to medium-term expenditure commitments.

\[\[FIGURE OMITTED\]\]

As shown in Figure 3, Saudi Arabia's break-even oil price decreased
after the 2014 oil-revenue shock due to the growth of non-oil revenues
and a sharp reduction in spending. While most regional estimates put the
Kingdom's break-even oil price slightly above those of its peers, such
as Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, the decline in the
break-even price after 2014 reflects significant progress, particularly
considering the resumption of spending growth since 2019. Figure 3
should, however, be caveated: a meaningful reduction in oil dependence
will break the historical tendency of break-evens to correlate with oil
revenues over the cycle.

While it will take a few more years to get a better understanding of
more recent fiscal dynamics in Saudi Arabia, it appears that the fiscal
break-even oil price has again risen in response to increased oil
revenues in 2022 and 2023. The most recent estimates by the IMF, for
example, released in the fourth quarter of 2023, suggested that the most
recent break-even oil price for Saudi Arabia is once again US\$86 per
barrel. Further, estimates of the break-even oil price that attempt to
account for investment and expenditure through the PIF are higher than
those focused exclusively on the budget. The increase in break-even oil
prices in recent years suggests that the procyclical relationship
between spending, investment and oil prices remains a concern.

\[\[FIGURE OMITTED\]\]

Oil dependence is also evident with respect to Saudi Arabia's external
balances. A short-hand proxy for the oil-price sensitivity of the Saudi
current-account balance is to estimate an "external break-even" price
for oil. This is akin to the fiscal break-even oil price, but rather
than estimating the oil price required to balance the budget, the focus
is rather on the oil price needed to generate sufficient export revenues
to pay for imports. Figure 4 shows Brad Setser's estimates for Saudi
external break-even oil prices (see Setser and Frank, 2017 for
methodology). Note that the recent increase in the external break-even
price for oil is in line with fiscal break-evens. Recent IMF estimates
of Saudi Arabia's external break-even oil price also show an increase
from around US\$50 per barrel in 2020 to over US\$90 per barrel for
2024. Moreover, as shown in Figure 5, relative to both total exports and
the total non-oil GDP, non-oil exports have remained relatively flat
since 2010. These data indicate that Saudi Arabia remains dependent on
oil revenues for external financing.

\[\[FIGURE OMITTED\]\]

Finally, oil dependence also manifests through cyclical correlation
between oil and various economic indicators. Procyclicality is evident
in the historical correlation between capital expenditure and oil
revenues, shown in Figure 6. This correlation suggests that the burden
of fiscal adjustment has historically fallen on the capital-spending
component of the budget. Given the central role of the PIF in capital
projects and infrastructure investments, a key objective is ensuring
these can be sustained in the event of lower oil revenues, breaking the
historic tendency to freeze capital projects when oil revenues decline.

\[\[FIGURE OMITTED\]\]

A **[stop-start pattern]{.underline}** in public investment is
**[problematic]{.underline}** from a diversification perspective and
**[presents a]{.underline}** potential **[challenge]{.underline}** to
the **[Vision 2030]{.underline}** agenda, should oil revenues
**[decline]{.underline}**. Commodity-dependent, high-cost economies need
**[patient capital]{.underline}** in which investment is
**[sustained]{.underline}** beyond the medium term. The relative absence
of obvious "low-hanging fruit" in the effort for diversification of the
Saudi economy requires a Long Push, rather than a Big Push -- thereby
putting a premium on institutions and policies that can promote
countercyclical resilience and sustainability.

Overall, the 2014 oil-revenue shock and its aftermath initiated
important fiscal reforms, notably the growth of non-oil revenues and
successful debt issuances. That said, the recent increase in fiscal and
external break-even price of oil, in correlation with higher oil prices
and revenues, suggests that the procyclical tendencies remain.
Macroeconomic [**[stability]{.underline}** and]{.mark} **[fiscal
[resilience]{.mark}]{.underline}**, therefore, [persist as]{.mark}
notable [risks in the event of]{.mark} sharp or **[[protracted
decline]{.underline}]{.mark}** in oil revenues. In the remainder of this
paper, we consider policies that will enhance sustainability, stability
and resilience -- which are critical to the transition from the Big Push
to the Long Push.

Box 1: Cross-Border Co-Investment, Leapfrogging Innovation and
Attracting FDI

Some commodity-dependent economies use their SWFs and SDFs to pursue and
accelerate long-term opportunities that can unlock significant gains in
productivity, innovation, and technology adoption. First, SWFs are
uniquely positioned to provide the patient, long-term capital that is
required to innovate from a low initial level. Second, and more
importantly, strategic cross-border SWF investments can target the
transfer of knowledge, technology and "know how", where those productive
capabilities are missing in the local market, thereby shortening the
horizon over which high-complexity economic activities become feasible.

Strategic SWFs and SDFs can be effective tools for stimulating local
economies and markets, while delivering strong investment returns
(Sharma, 2017). Indeed, when these funds are structured correctly, there
is considerable evidence that robust investment performance and national
development priorities can align.

Casady, Monk and Sharma (2024) show that, as of March 31, 2022,
Singapore\'s Temasek achieved a 40-year "total shareholder return" of
16% while catalyzing numerous domestic industries. Similarly, the
Mubadala Investment Company, a sovereign investor based in Abu Dhabi,
holds a five-year rolling rate of return of 12.2% since 2017. Moreover,
the Sixth Swedish National Pension Fund (AP6) posted a five-year average
return of 16.8% and a ten-year average return of 13%. Clark and Monk
(2015) argue that SDFs typically pursue a combination of four
development objectives alongside commercial returns:

Reinforcing: SDFs that own existing but underperforming national
assets---such as companies, infrastructure, or other real assets---are
responsible for reorganizing, professionalizing, and innovating state
holdings to drive commercialization and enhance returns.

Crowding-In: SDFs that invest in emerging domestic industries can
achieve greater financial and developmental returns when they attract
capital commitments from both private and public investors from other
nations. For instance, if an SDF demonstrates credible commercial
acumen, it can syndicate local deals with investors who might otherwise
invest elsewhere.

Catalytic: SDFs not tied to specific industries or national assets can
catalyze new industries, thereby diversifying the economy away from
sectors that are no longer profitable or sustainable in the long term.
These SDFs also address gaps in the economy by investing in solutions
that will undoubtedly be required within the next decade.

Financialization: Leveraging their capabilities and resources, SDFs can
enhance the financial infrastructure of the local economy, thereby
supporting the development process through the expansion of the capital
market and the emergence of new financial intermediaries and investors
focused on regional opportunities.

In the case of Saudi Arabia, the PIF is pursuing all four
diversification priorities simultaneously. This is an ambitious agenda,
which will require significant resources. Fortunately, the Saudi economy
is already large, with a GDP of more than US\$1.2 trillion. The Vision
2030 will see this large economy transformed and transitioned away from
fossil-fuel dependence and towards a net-zero footprint. The environment
established in Saudi Arabia through Vision 2030 is ideally suited to
this model of cross-border co-investment, led by the PIF. The strategic
use of the PIF's balance sheet to co-invest with sector-specific global
corporate leaders can promote leapfrogging -- essentially, "importing"
technologies to skip intermediate steps on the productivity-growth
ladder -- thus expediting the expansion of Saudi productive
capabilities.

Moreover, we believe that the co-investment model will also create
opportunities for "crowding-in" private Saudi capital -- and triangulate
between the PIF, global firms and the domestic private sector and
investor base. The establishment of local investment opportunities in
partnership with global corporations will also promote the deepening of
the Kingdom's capital markets and provide investment vehicles and
destinations for attracting FDI, creating an opportunity to reduce
corporate tax rates to a globally competitive level of 15%.

Reduced investment taxes would be productive at this point of
development, given the need to attract FDI, as it will enhance
foreign-investor appetite in Saudi Arabia. Higher taxation may be
considered once a critical level of investment has been attracted and
the Saudi tax system has evolved to the point where a comprehensive
package of investment and tax incentives can be offered to long-term
investors.

IV\. Increasing Resilience:

The Role of Foreign Assets and Investment Income

[While **[2024 oil prices]{.underline}**]{.mark} are currently within a
range that **[[allow]{.underline}]{.mark}**s Saudi Arabia to break even
on [a]{.mark} broadly **[[expansionary fiscal
path]{.underline}]{.mark}** and **[cover]{.underline}** its
**[import]{.underline}** cost**[s]{.underline}**, the [reform
**[momentum]{.underline}**]{.mark} that was initiated by the 2014
collapse in oil prices [would be **[tested]{.underline}** in]{.mark} the
event of [a]{.mark} similar [**[decline]{.underline}** in oil
revenues]{.mark}. Generating hard-currency financial income is a
critical function of many SWFs, with offshore allocations accounting for
all or most assets of the Norwegian, Abu Dhabi, Kuwaiti, Qatari and
Chilean funds (in addition to several non-commodity SWFs, such as those
from New Zealand, Australia, China and Singapore). In this section, we
outline the conceptual case for accumulating foreign assets,
particularly in resource-dependent economies, before considering how
such a policy could be designed and implemented in Saudi Arabia.

#### Saudi Arabia is ploughing oil money into [Vision 2030]{.underline}\-\--it'll [successfully diversify]{.underline} their economy. 

**Jones 24**, Editor at the International Banker. Citing the IMF,

2030: The Lynchpin of Saudi Arabia's Unprecedented Economic
Transformation,\" International Banker,

[[A **dramatic**]{.mark} economic [**transformation** is]{.mark}
currently [**ongoing** in Saudi]{.mark}]{.underline} Arabia. As part of
a 15-year project designed to realise the Kingdom's true economic
potential, the ambitious [**[Vision]{.mark} 2030**
[has]{.mark}]{.underline} already [[achieved]{.mark} significant
**[milestones]{.mark}** as it **strives** [to]{.mark} lower
dependence]{.underline} on its oil-export economy [and **[usher
in]{.mark}**]{.underline} the dawn of a new era of
**[[diversification]{.underline}]{.mark}** and opportunity for its
citizens. Now, in early 2024, having just passed the initiative's
midpoint, it is worth reflecting on the roadmap's major accomplishments
and the outlook for the largest economy (by nominal gross domestic
product) in the Middle East for the remainder of the decade.

Launched in April 2016, Vision 2030 has been largely spearheaded by
Saudi Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman (widely known
as MBS), who has positioned the programme front and centre within many
government agencies. It is mainly focused on three primary themes: (i)
societal, (ii) economic/financial and (iii) global reach.

On the economic front, the strategy is unwaveringly fixed on
diversifying away from oil and creating a broad cross-section of
high-value job opportunities for its citizens. The desired
diversification away from crude oil comes when fossil fuels have never
been more scrutinised and disdained. With the eyes of the world fixed on
many oil-producing nations---not least the Kingdom itself---a concerted
transition away from oil and gas could not come at a more pertinent
time. Indeed, after the United Nations' (UN's) Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change's (IPCC's) 2022 research found that carbon emissions
must be cut by 43 percent by 2030 from 2019 levels and reach net zero by
2050 to comply with the 2015 Paris Agreement's global warming
sub-1.5-degree-Celsius (°C) target, the Kingdom's shift towards greener
energy sources has become essential.

According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the
[diversification]{.underline} process [is **amply supported** by
improvements in **regulatory**]{.underline} and business
**[environments]{.underline}**. "As a result of a new set of laws to
promote entrepreneurship, protect investors' rights, and reduce the
costs of doing business, new investment deals and licenses grew by 95
percent and 267 percent in 2022, respectively," the Fund reported on
September 28.

The IMF has also observed the crucial role played by
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} Public Investment Fund (PIF) (the country's
**[[sovereign-wealth fund]{.underline}]{.mark}** currently worth around
\$776 billion), which [has [provided financial backing
to]{.mark}]{.underline} many of [the programme's **most**]{.underline}
exciting and **[[ambitious]{.underline}]{.mark}** economic
**[[projects]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[as well as]{.mark} invested
in]{.underline} new projects and **[[private]{.underline}]{.mark}**
growth **[[sectors]{.underline}]{.mark}** that are [now
**[driving]{.mark}**]{.underline} much of the country's
**[[progress]{.underline}]{.mark}**. One example of the PIF's success
can be found in the \$1.3-trillion Private Sector Partnership
Reinforcement Center (Shareek), which has already invested in green
hydrogen, catalyst manufacturing for industrial refining and chemical
production, and several tech-innovation facilities. Shareek also aims to
create more than 64,000 jobs by 2040.

Although not formally part of Vision 2030, PIF's globally renowned
giga-projects have become closely associated with the programme. Some
projects have commenced construction, including the Red Sea global
tourism, the Qiddiya entertainment city and the Diriyah Gate heritage
development initiatives. But the Kingdom's most hotly discussed
sustainability-based giga-project, Neom, has garnered the most global
attention based on its unique design and sheer magnitude, alongside the
distinctly light environmental footprint it seeks to cultivate with a
new model of sustainable living. Again, PIF represents the overwhelming
bulk of the investments in these giga-projects, with other sources of
private funding expected to ramp up over the coming years.

Indeed, [[**vast resources** are being deployed]{.underline}]{.mark}
across a range of projects to facilitate this all-encompassing economic
transformation. "[Efforts are underway [to make the country a
**powerhouse** in **green energy**]{.mark}]{.underline} (including
hydrogen), mining, logistics and
**[[infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[sports]{.underline}**,
music, **[tourism]{.underline}**, digital services, finance, [[and
**entrepreneurship**]{.underline}]{.mark}," Rabah Arezki, director of
research at the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS),
and Tarik M. Yousef, director and senior fellow of the Middle East
Council on Global Affairs, jointly wrote in a June 2023 article for US
media publication Project Syndicate.

And it is already clearly observable that many of [**[Vision]{.mark}**
2030**['s]{.mark}**]{.underline} lofty [[ambitions are **being
realised**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [as is **considerable progress**
towards achieving **key**]{.underline} economic **[aims]{.underline}**.
"Our assessment is that [[performance is **solid**]{.mark} relative
to]{.underline} most of [the]{.underline} 14 quantified [economic
targets]{.underline} contained with[in the original vision
document]{.underline}," PwC (PricewaterhouseCoopers) concluded in late
October. "The results range from significant outperformance in some
areas, such as female labour participation and home ownership, while
there is room for further development in others. The areas that need
focus include foreign direct investment and religious tourism, but both
are already showing signs that they will improve in the coming years."

Indeed, [[Saudi]{.underline}]{.mark} Arabia [[was]{.mark} not only [the
**fastest-growing** G20]{.mark}]{.underline} (Group of Twenty)
**[economy]{.underline}** in 2022 at 8.7 percent GDP (gross domestic
product) growth, but [its non-oil-related growth also stood at a hefty
4.8]{.underline} percent, [with the IMF attributing the strong
performance to robust private consumption and]{.underline} non-oil
**[private investment]{.underline}**, including giga-project
implementations and strong growth rates in wholesale, retail trade,
construction and transport. And the [[commitment to
**diversifying**]{.mark} its economy]{.underline} and reducing reliance
on the oil sector "[[has resulted in a **significant
transition**]{.underline}]{.mark}", the IMF added, noting that the share
of non-oil activities was double that of 30 years ago, while the
proportion of oil activities "declined substantially over the same
period".

"The [Saudi unemployment]{.underline} rate [is at a historical
low]{.underline}. Amid an increase in labor force participation, total
unemployment dropped to 4.8 percent by end-2022---from 9 percent during
Covid---reflecting both an increase in Saudi workers in the private
sector and expatriate workers (mostly in the construction and
agricultural sectors) rising back above pre-Covid levels," the IMF noted
on September 6 following its consultation with Saudi Arabia ending July
20. "Youth unemployment was halved to 16.8 percent in 2022 over the past
two years, while female participation in the labor force reached 36
percent in 2022, exceeding the 30 percent target set under the
authorities' Vision 2030 reform agenda."

And perhaps most encouraging is the recognition by the traditionally
conservative country that raising [the socioeconomic prospects for Saudi
women has been long overdue]{.underline}, with this acknowledgement no
more clearly observed than through the greatly expanded role of female
economic participation within the Vision 2030 revolution. Specifically,
the Ministry of Commerce has removed guardian-approval restrictions such
that [women can more easily open their own businesses]{.underline}; it
has established business centres exclusively for women across the
country to open business registrations, request trademark registrations,
reserve business names, practise freelancing and register business
agencies.

"The Kingdom established reforms dedicated to the promotion of women's
engagement in economic development by setting an equal age for both
genders, preventing gender discrimination in terms of wages, occupation,
work field and hours, and enabling women to incorporate and practice
commercial business without obtaining prior consent," the Saudi
government states on its website.

**[Nonetheless]{.underline}**, clear downside risks to the Kingdom's
goals remain, especially given that [its exposure to

#### Saudi oil revenue is strong and key to growth.

Anant **Chandak** 10/23/**2024**, polling correspondent, \"Saudi Arabian
economic growth to accelerate in 2025 as oil taps open: Reuters poll,\"
Reuters, 10/23/2024,
https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/saudi-arabian-economic-growth-accelerate-2025-oil-taps-open-2024-10-23/

Economic [**[growth]{.underline}** in Saudi]{.mark} Arabia [will
**[accelerate]{.underline}**]{.mark} next year [thanks]{.mark} [to
**[higher oil output]{.underline}**]{.mark} after two years of modest
performance, according to a Reuters poll of economists, who also
forecast robust growth for other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by
Russia, known as [OPEC]{.mark}+, [has been curbing]{.mark} oil
[output]{.mark} [since]{.mark} late [2022 but is expected to increase
production]{.mark} in December, likely **[boosting
revenues]{.underline}** for the six GCC countries.

Crude oil prices are expected to remain broadly weak and average \$76.75
per barrel next year, up from around \$74.8 currently, according to a
separate Reuters poll.

Saudi Arabia, the world\'s largest exporter of crude oil, is reportedly
preparing to abandon its unofficial target of reaching \$100 per barrel.
This will allow the kingdom to reverse past production cuts and increase
market share, which along with non-oil revenue growth, will help drive
faster economic growth.

The Oct. 9-22 Reuters poll of 21 economists forecast the Saudi economy
would expand 4.4% in 2025, the fastest in three years, and up from an
expected 1.3% this year.

The GCC economies were forecast to expand an average 4.1% next year, up
from the 3.7% expected in a July poll and faster than the 1.8% growth
projected for 2024.

\"We expect the effects of **[[lower]{.mark} oil
[prices]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and **[higher production
volumes]{.underline}**]{.mark} (to) largely
(**[[offset]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [each other]{.mark}. Since growth is
focusing on produced volumes, [real]{.mark} GDP [growth will still
benefit]{.mark} and accelerate in 2025 relative to 2024,\" said Ralf
Wiegert, head of MENA economics at S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Prominent economies in the region, [Saudi]{.mark} Arabia, the United
Arab Emirates, and Qatar, [have been exploring ways to diversify]{.mark}
from relying on oil as their main revenue source, with many economists
predicting the growth rate in non-oil GDP will be largely in line with
oil GDP next year.

\"However, [oil]{.mark} revenues will [play a critical role]{.mark} for
all of the three economies. Even in the long-term outlook,
[**[non-oil]{.underline}** revenues will be **[unable to
replace]{.underline}** **[oil]{.underline}**]{.mark} revenues,\" Wiegert
said.

### UQ -- Demand Stable

#### Demand are stable now.

Summer **Said &** Benoit **Faucon 24**, Middle East Correspondents,
\"OPEC+ Agrees to Extend Production Cuts in Bid to Boost Oil Prices,\"
Wall Street Journal, 06/02/2024,
https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-oil/opec-agrees-to-extend-production-cuts-in-bid-to-boost-oil-prices-7ef55454?mod=itp_wsj,djemITP_h

[OPEC]{.mark}+ on Sunday agreed to extend all production curbs into next
year, a [deal]{.mark} that likely [signals]{.mark} **[oil
[prices]{.mark}]{.underline}** will [remain
**[elevated]{.underline}**]{.mark} [through]{.mark} the U.S.
[presidential election]{.mark}.

The agreement comes on the same day the group's kingpin, [Saudi]{.mark}
Arabia, launched a **[giant [sale]{.mark}]{.underline}** of
[shares]{.mark} in its national oil champion that will yield billions
[to]{.mark} help [fund]{.mark} the kingdom's **[economic
[transformation]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies,
together known as OPEC+, agreed to keep **[collective
curbs]{.underline}** through next year. The group has longstanding
official reductions of 3.66 million barrels a day.

The new deal includes the United Arab Emirates securing another upgrade
to its official production quota, by 300,000 barrels a day. The UAE's
new official quota will be gradually phased in starting in January and
stand at 3.519 million barrels a day by September 2025.

Eight top [producers]{.mark} in the group also agreed to
[continue]{.mark} **[[voluntary cuts]{.underline}]{.mark}** separately
into 2025, currently around 2.2 million barrels a day, according to an
OPEC+ document. But the voluntary cuts, which include a production cut
of one million barrels a day from top producer Saudi Arabia, will be
only maintained at the same level for three months before being
gradually eased through September next year, the document says.

In effect, the agreement [gives]{.mark} the [cartel]{.mark}
**[considerably [leeway]{.mark}]{.underline}** to make adjustments
[depending on market]{.mark} conditions.

The [curbs are]{.mark} aimed at **[[bolstering
prices]{.underline}]{.mark}** and [avoiding]{.mark} a global surplus in
a context of rising output from other nonmember producers, particularly
the U.S., and [concerns over demand]{.mark} [amid]{.mark} high
**[interest [rates]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and
**[inflation]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, currently trades around
\$83 a barrel, some way off its intraday high for the year to date of
\$91.17 on April 5, while the U.S. oil gauge, West Texas Intermediate,
is at \$79 a barrel. Both benchmarks regained some ground last week
supported by market expectations of OPEC+ cuts and elevated tensions in
the Middle East, but failed to gather significant momentum.

The price of oil, and in particular its effect on inflation and
consumers' outlook on the economy, will be closely watched in a
presidential election year in the U.S. While gas prices have drifted
downward of late, the extension of the production cuts is likely to keep
them from falling dramatically.

Higher [oil prices]{.mark} are also designed to [**[boost]{.underline}**
the Saudi economy]{.mark}.

Saudi Arabia on Sunday started selling less than 1% in state-run oil
giant Aramco, potentially raising almost \$12 billion, an offering that
followed the record \$25.6 billion generated in its 2019 initial public
listing. The kingdom has embarked on many megaprojects including a
multibillion-dollar city in the desert and a global airline and needs
oil in the high \$90s to fund its ambitions, according to market
watchers.

#### Sustained demand, with matched supply stabilizes oil markets.

**Oilfield Workers 25** -- (Oilfield Workers, 02/16/2025, "Oil Price
Stability: The Factors Keeping Markets Balanced", Oilfield Workers,
<https://oilfieldworkers.com/news/oil-price-stability-the-factors-keeping-markets-balanced/>)

Despite global uncertainties[, [oil prices have demonstrated remarkable
stability]{.underline}]{.mark}, resisting extreme fluctuations even
amidst economic turmoil, geopolitical tensions, and rapid technological
advancements. [This [resilience stems from]{.mark} a combination of
[econ]{.mark}omic [mechanisms]{.mark}, strategic [geopolitical
maneuvers]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} industry-driven [tech]{.mark}nological
[innovations]{.mark}.]{.underline} Understanding these [stabilizing
factors is crucial for stakeholders in the oil and gas
industry]{.underline} looking to navigate an evolving energy landscape.

Historically, oil prices have been prone to volatility due to factors
such as supply disruptions, demand fluctuations, speculative trading,
and unforeseen geopolitical crises. However, [recent years have seen a
[greater ability]{.mark} of the market [to absorb shocks and
maintain]{.mark} relative [stability]{.mark}]{.underline}. By analyzing
these elements in greater depth, we can better understand why the global
oil market has avoided extreme price swings despite numerous external
pressures.

[The [balance between supply and demand is]{.mark} the most [fundamental
determinant of oil price stability]{.mark}]{.underline}. OPEC+ plays a
crucial role in regulating production to prevent excessive price swings.
By adjusting output based on real-time market conditions, [[OPEC+
nations ensure that neither surplus]{.mark} production [nor]{.mark}
[supply deficits push oil prices into extreme
volatility]{.mark}.]{.underline} Additionally, U.S. shale production has
become an important factor in the global supply equation. Advances in
[[shale drilling tech]{.mark}nology have [allowed the U.S. to act as a
swing producer, increasing production]{.mark} when prices rise
[and]{.mark} [scaling back]{.mark} during downturns, [which]{.mark}
further [stabilizes the market.]{.mark}]{.underline}

On the demand side, [industrial activity, economic growth, and
transportation trends shape oil consumption patterns. Rapid
[urbanization and industrialization in Asia]{.mark}]{.underline},
particularly in China and India[, [have sustained global oil
demand]{.mark}.]{.underline} Conversely, economic slowdowns in major
economies such as the U.S. or the European Union can lead to reduced
consumption, counteracting potential price surges. [The rise of [energy
efficiency measures and alternative energy sources]{.mark} also [plays a
role in modulating oil demand]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[creating a]{.mark}
more [balanced and predictable market]{.mark} environment.]{.underline}

#### Models predict demand stability throughout 2025

**Gonzales 25** -- (Freschia Gonzales, 01/17/2025, "Deloitte predicts
stable oil prices and robust natural gas demand in 2025", Wealth
Professional,
<https://www.wealthprofessional.ca/news/industry-news/deloitte-predicts-stable-oil-prices-and-robust-natural-gas-demand-in-2025/388091>)

Andrew Botterill, energy and resources partner at Deloitte Canada,
discussed the oil and gas outlook with Financial Post's Larysa Harapyn.

[He highlighted market stability, growth prospects, and challenges
facing the sector in 2025.]{.underline}

[Botterill noted that [despite geopolitical turmoil in 2024]{.mark},
including conflicts in Israel and Ukraine,]{.underline} [[the oil market
remained stable.]{.underline}]{.mark}

He said, "[It's amazing how truly stable and balanced the oil market
was," with prices ranging between \$80 and \$90 per barrel.]{.underline}

Looking ahead[, he stated that [2025 is expected to mirror 2024]{.mark},
with prices averaging around \$70 per barrel]{.underline}. However, [if
[geopolitical negotiations bring more stability]{.mark}, prices may
soften further.]{.underline}

Regarding US-Canada trade integration, Botterill highlighted the
reliance of Gulf Coast and Midwest refineries on Canadian crude.

He acknowledged that while [[companies feel confident in the market's
supply and demand dynamics]{.underline}]{.mark}, they remain cautious
about potential policy changes under the new US administration.

He added that firms are planning for growth but keeping portfolios
flexible due to potential policy volatility.

On natural gas, Botterill outlined the contrast with oil. He stated that
2024 saw soft prices for Canadian producers as they ramped up liquefied
natural gas (LNG) exports.

However, with multiple export projects coming online in Canada, the US,
and Mexico, demand is set to rise. He projected natural gas prices to
nearly double in 2025, giving producers more confidence in their
budgets.

[[Investment in the sector is likely to grow, driven by optimism about
stable oil prices]{.underline}]{.mark} and strong demand for natural
gas. Botterill cautioned that companies might delay committing to
long-term projects until policy uncertainties are resolved.

[He said [firms are adept at managing volatility and may adjust
budgets]{.mark} if policy developments fall short of
expectations.]{.underline}

[Deloitte's report [forecasts oil prices to remain around \$70 per
barrel in 2025, with some market backwardation indicating potential
softening towards year-end]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The sector's
ability to navigate policy and market challenges will shape its growth
trajectory in the coming year.

The [price of]{.underline} West Texas Intermediate ([WTI]{.underline})
is [currently trading above the \$68 per barrel mark, approaching \$70
per barrel.]{.underline} The [**rising price** of the
commodity]{.underline}, being backed by renewed tensions in the Middle
East, is a boon for the exploration and production activities
of ConocoPhillips COP.

The upstream energy major has low-cost resources both internationally
and in the United States. ConocoPhillips is more confident in its
resources within the United States, which it refers to as the Lower 48,
comprising major shale plays like the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford and
Bakken. This demonstrates resilience in ConocoPhillips' business model.

With the [oil price **significantly** higher than the **break-even**
price]{.underline} in the prolific resources, where COP is operating
currently, the ongoing pricing environment of the commodity is highly
favorable for the company's overall business, thereby aiding its bottom
line.

The IEA said the global oil market may be tighter than it appears, with
demand supported by peak summer refinery runs to meet travel and power
generation.

Front-month September Brent contracts were trading at about a \$1.20
premium to October futures.

\"[The market is starting to realize that supplies are
tight,\"]{.underline} said Phil Flynn, senior analyst with Price Futures
Group.

U.S. energy firms this week cut the number of oil and natural gas rigs
operating for an 11th straight week, energy services firm Baker Hughes
said. The last time that happened was July 2020, when the COVID-19
pandemic cut demand for fuel.

Short-term market tightness notwithstanding, the IEA boosted its
forecast for supply growth this year, while trimming its outlook for
growth in demand, implying a market in surplus.

tariff talks with key trading partners. The European Union and South
Korea said on Monday they were working on trade deals with the U.S. that
would soften the blow from looming tariffs as Washington threatens to

[U.S. [oil prices]{.mark} bounced [back to]{.mark} around [\$62 a

[erasing]{.mark} earlier [losses]{.mark} [after]{.mark} President
[Trump]{.mark} said he would [pause]{.mark} his reciprocal
[tariffs]{.mark} for most countries for 90 days.]{.underline} The
commodity price, an indicator of economic confidence, has swung wildly
over the past week, trading as high as \$72 a barrel and as low as \$55.
Oil prices sank into the mid \$50s early Wednesday after China said it
would match Mr. Trump's tariffs blow for blow. [[Wednesday]{.mark}
[afternoon's]{.mark} [recovery]{.mark} [put prices back]{.mark} around
the level that many U.S. oil companies require to make money drilling
new wells.]{.underline} But prices are still far lower than they were
before Mr. Trump ratcheted up tariffs on nearly all countries with which
the United States trades goods. For now, many companies are waiting to
see where prices settle before adjusting drilling or spending plans. As
this week has demonstrated, commodity prices can be very volatile. If
prices fall further, to around \$50 a barrel, U.S. oil production could
decline by about 8 percent in a year, according to S&P Global Commodity
Insights. Peter Navarro, a trade adviser to Mr. Trump, has frequently
cited the benefits of \$50 a barrel oil, saying it would curb inflation.
Earnings are likely to fall as well, the Moody's ratings agency said
Wednesday, forecasting that profits will shrink by 10 percent or more
across the global energy industry over the next 12 to 18 months. Moody's
previously expected profits would be flat compared with 2024. The recent
price slide has spooked U.S. oil executives, many of whom backed Mr.
Trump's campaign in hopes that he would open new areas for drilling and
make it easier to secure permits for pipelines and other infrastructure.
"That's a pretty expensive trade-off," Dan Pickering, chief investment
officer for Pickering Energy Partners, a Houston financial services
firm, said on Friday, when oil was trading around \$62 a barrel. A broad
group of U.S. oil and gas stocks was down about 15 percent in the past
week. It has been about four years since oil prices were as low as they
have been in the past few days. [The [decline]{.mark} has [yet to

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he will send Patriot air
defence missiles to Ukraine. He is due to make a \"major statement\" on
Russia on Monday.

Trump has expressed frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin
due to the lack of progress in ending the war in Ukraine and Russia\'s
intensifying bombardment of Ukrainian cities.

In a bid to pressure Moscow into good-faith peace negotiations with
Ukraine, a bipartisan U.S. bill that would hit Russia with sanctions
gained momentum last week in Congress, but it still awaits support from
Trump.

European Union envoys are on the verge of agreeing an 18th package of
sanctions against Russia that would include a lower price cap on Russian
oil, four EU sources said after a Sunday meeting.

However, ANZ analysts said price gains were limited by data showing

[O[il markets have remained]{.underline}]{.mark} [remarkably
[resilient]{.mark} so far this year, [despite]{.mark} concerns over U.S.
President Donald [Trump\'s]{.mark} trade [policies]{.mark} and rising
OPEC+ production quotas]{.underline}. But that strength will now be
tested, as Saudi output is starting to surge just as demand appears to
be slowing.

[Benchmark [oil prices are]{.mark} currently near \$[70 a
barrel]{.mark}, down from a 2025 high of \$82 in mid-January, but
[above]{.mark} the [four-year low]{.mark} of \$62 [set in
May]{.mark}]{.underline}. That followed Trump\'s \"Liberation Day\"
tariffflip-flop, which sparked confusion about the policy direction and
fears of a severe disruption to global economic activity and oil
consumption.

Investor jitters were compounded by a significant OPEC+ policy shift[.
Under the leadership of Saudi Arabia, the group including the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia, started to
aggressively ramp up production quotas in April for the first time in
over three years. [The group]{.mark} [is set to add 2.5 million
barrels]{.mark} per day of production [between April and
September]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Given this backdrop, why has crude remained so resilient? It's likely in
large part because most of these fears have yet to materialize.

Crucially, Trump not only delayed his 'reciprocal tariffs', but he also
held positive talks with Beijing, which managed to defuse some of the
market's worst fears about trade tensions between the world\'s two
biggest economies.

To be sure, economic activity has slowed in recent months, but not
nearly as badly as the initial drop in oil prices implied. Global GDP is
forecast to slow to 2.3% in 2025, according to a recent World Bank
report, opens new tab, nearly half a percentage point lower than
expected at the start of the year.

The OPEC+ supply hikes were also initially more talk than action. The
decision by OPEC+ to unwind 2.2 million bpd of supply cuts, as well as
to raise the United Arab Emirates baseline production by 300,000 bpd
starting in April, initially had little impact on global supplies,
mostly because several members had already been producing above their
assigned quotas.

While Saudi Arabia's production did rise significantly in June by
700,000 bpd to 9.8 million bpd, a large share of the increase was
consumed domestically by its refineries as well as in power plants that
use crude to generate electricity during summer\'s peak demand, limiting
exports. Saudi \"crude burn\" is set to reach 695,000 bpd in July and is
expected to remain elevated in August, according to consultancy Wood
Mackenzie.

SHIFTING TIDES

[The tide may be turning, however. As we move into the second half of
the year, the negative trends that spooked investors in April now appear
to be building]{.underline}.

Trade tensions have come back to the fore in recent days after Trump
outlined new tariffs for a number of countries, including allies Japan
and South Korea, along with a 50% tariff on copper, and a 35% levy on
many Canadian goods.

Crude consumption already started to falter in recent months. While
demand rose by a robust 1.1 million barrels per day in the first quarter
of 2025, growth is set to halve in the second quarter, according to the
International Energy Agency.

Importantly, demand in countries that are heavily dependent on trade
with the United States seems to have taken a hit. Demand in China
dropped in the second quarter from a year earlier by 160,000 bpd,
Japan's by 80,000 bpd, Mexico's by 40,000 bpd and South Korea's by
70,000 bpd. U.S. demand over the same period also contracted by 60,000
bpd, according to the IEA. These trends could accelerate if the trade
wars kick in in earnest.

SAUDI SURGE

[Meanwhile, [oil production]{.mark} is expected [to]{.mark} start
[rising significantly]{.mark} in the coming months, particularly from
Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, as it ramps up production
and [as its]{.mark} domestic [crude]{.mark} burn [eases]{.mark} as

[[Saudi's]{.mark} increase in domestic consumption initially meant its
[oil]{.mark} exports only [rose from 5.9]{.mark} million bpd in April
[to 6.4 million]{.mark} bpd in June, according to Kpler data. Saudi
shipments are, however, [set to surge to 7.5 million]{.mark} bpd in
July, the highest since April 2023.]{.underline}

Saudi production and exports are likely to increase further in August as
Riyadh seeks to regain market share. Its slice of the global market
declined to 11% last year from a 13% average in the previous three
decades. [The [Kingdom's exports]{.mark} to China are [set to]{.mark}
rise to the highest in more than two years in August, Reuters

#### Saudi raising oil prices now

Accessed 7-14-2025; JC\]

Saudi Aramco will be selling its crude to all buyers next month, even as
OPEC+ agreed to boost supply by more than what analysts expected.

[Kpler's Amena Bakr published the new Aramco price list on X, showing
that the biggest price hike will hit buyers of Saudi crude in Europe.
The hike across crude blends is \$1.40 per barrel from
July.]{.underline}

[Asian buyers will have to pay between \$0.90 and \$1.30 more per barrel
of Saudi crude next month, while buyers in North America will enjoy the
most modest price hike, by between \$0.20 and \$0.40 per
barrel.]{.underline}

Summer is peak fuel demand in the northern hemisphere and analysts
expected Aramco to hike its oil prices whatever OPEC+ decided at its
latest meeting. What OPEC+ decided at that meeting was to add 548,000
barrels daily to its output, prompting a price drop in oil when markets
opened today.

At the time of writing, Brent crude was trading at \$67.88 per barrel,
with West Texas Intermediate at \$66.14 per barrel, both slightly down
from Friday's close.

[The latest output hike should result in the return of 80% of the total
cuts---at 2.2 million bpd---agreed back in 2022, according to RBC
Capital Markets' Helima Croft]{.underline}. However, Reuters noted in a
report on the news that actual production growth among the eight OPEC+
members that were cutting supply has been slower than agreed, and most
of it has come from the biggest cutter, Saudi Arabia.

[Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, was quick to predict another oversized OPEC+
output hike in September, at 500,000 barrels daily. The bank issued the
prediction on Sunday, saying "Saturday\'s announcement to accelerate
supply hikes increases our confidence that the shift, which we started
flagging last summer, to a more long-run equilibrium focused on
normalizing spare capacity and market share]{.underline}, supporting
internal cohesion, and strategically disciplining US shale supply, is
continuing."

#### Increase demand in oil allowing Saudi companies to spike prices

**TOI 7-12**\[Times of India; team of journalists and writers that sift
through global events; 07-12-25; TOI World Desk: Read Latest News from

[In a move that has caught both traders and analysts off guard, Saudi
Aramco raised the official selling price (OSP) of its Arab Light crude
to Asia by \$2.20 per barrel above the Oman/Dubai average for August
deliveries. This represents the steepest premium since April and far
exceeds the forecasted range of \$0.50 to \$0.80 per barrel. As per
reports, pricing for European buyers has also risen by \$1.40 per barrel
for Northwest Europe while other grades such as Arab Medium, Heavy, and
Extra Light saw increases between \$0.90 and \$1.30.]{.underline}

This pricing decision comes amid a convergence of domestic and
international pressures: a surge in local power demand, rising exports
to China, and a coordinated OPEC+ move to unwind production cuts that
were initially implemented to stabilise pandemic-era oil markets.

Why Is Saudi Arabia Raising Prices Now?

One of the most immediate drivers behind the price hike is Saudi
Arabia's own seasonal energy needs. With air conditioning usage surging
across the Kingdom during the intense summer heat, the country has
ramped up its crude burn to fuel domestic power stations[. Industry
sources estimate that Saudi Arabia could be using up to 470,000 barrels
per day of crude for electricity generation, especially as fuel oil has
become costlier in global markets.]{.underline}

[Simultaneously, demand from Asia, particularly China is rebounding
strongly.]{.underline} In August, Saudi crude exports to China are
expected to hit 1.65 million barrels per day, the highest level in over
two years[. Chinese refiners, particularly state-run Sinopec, have
increased orders following maintenance shutdowns in the second quarter.
This additional pull from China provides Riyadh with the leverage to set
higher price points for its crude.]{.underline}

[Beyond bilateral trade, the move comes at a time when OPEC+, the
alliance of oil-producing nations led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, has
decided to raise production by 548,000 barrels per day in
August]{.underline}. This is the most significant step yet in a
multi-month plan to restore roughly 2.2 million barrels per day of
previously withheld output.

### UQ -- Saudi wants Stability

#### Saudi investments assume increases in demand, the plan changes that.

**Oleniak 25** -- (Liliana Oleniak, 01/24/25, "Saudi Arabia responds to
Trump\'s proposal to cut oil prices", RBC-UKRAINE,
https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/saudi-arabia-responds-to-trump-s-proposal-1737726251.html)

[[Saudi Arabia is ready to meet the growing global demand for oil. The
priority is market stability]{.underline},]{.mark} according to Faisal
Alibrahim, Minister of Economy of Saudi Arabia.

[Asked whether [Saudi Arabia]{.mark} would reduce the price of
oil]{.underline} (after US President Donald Trump said in Davos that he
would ask the kingdom and OPEC to do so), [he said that Riyadh [is
focused on]{.mark} the long-term [stability of the oil
market.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"[The kingdom\'s position, [OPEC]{.mark}\'s position, [is all about
long-term market stability to make sure that there\'s enough supply for
the growing demand]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}" particularly from the
US and artificial intelligence, he said in Davos.

Faisal Alibrahim said that the [[\$600 billion in]{.mark} expanded
[investment and trade]{.mark} [with the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} mentioned by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed
bin Salman [[covers investment]{.mark} as well as procurement [in
the]{.mark} [public and private sectors]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Salman reaffirmed the kingdom\'s intention to expand US investment and
trade over the next four years to the tune of \$600 billion and possibly
even more.

"[This [number represents investments, procurement]{.mark}, public and
private sector, and [it\'s]{.mark} just [a mirror]{.mark} [reflection of
the strong relationship]{.mark}]{.underline}," Faisal Alibrahim said
when asked if the kingdom would increase this figure to \$1 trillion, as
Trump suggested at the forum.

"From the beginning of Vision 2030 until 2030, we have invested 12 times
more in the economy," Alibrahim said.

Vision 2030 is an ambitious program launched in 2016 and aimed at
reforming the Saudi economy to reduce dependence on hydrocarbons, create
jobs, and build new industries.

Faisal Alibrahim commented on the long-standing friendship between the
Kingdom and the United States.

[He said that [Saudi Arabia]{.mark}\'s position was [to have a strong
partnership with all its partners and friends.]{.mark}]{.underline} He
explained that tariffs had been used as a tool in the economy when they
were designed to achieve a goal and were limited in time. He added that
tariffs could help create a competitive environment for local industries
to get started.

US President Donald Trump called on Saudi Arabia and OPEC to reduce the
price of oil. According to him, if the price were to drop, Russia\'s war
against Ukraine would end quickly.

#### Saudi Arabia wants global oil market stability

**Kennedy 25** -- (Charles Kennedy, May 20, 2025, "Saudi Arabia Is
Prepared for Multiple Oil Price Scenarios", OilPrice,

[[Saudi Arabia's goal is long-term oil market
stability]{.underline}]{.mark}, while the Kingdom is always ready for
multiple oil price scenarios, Saudi Minister of Economy and Planning,
Faisal Alibrahim, said on Tuesday.

"We\'re always ready for scenarios - multiple scenarios, and we have
buffers," Alibrahim said at the Qatar Economic Forum in Doha.

["We have [the long-term fiscal planning and medium-term
frameworks]{.mark} that [help us adjust depending on]{.mark} what
[scenario]{.mark} actually plays out,"]{.underline} the Saudi official
added.

[On the energy markets and oil, [Saudi Arabia has always looked at the
long game of long-term market stability, which allows for investments in
adequate supply to meet global demand]{.mark}]{.underline}, Alibrahim
noted.

Early this month, [the [OPEC]{.mark}+ group led by Saudi Arabia [agreed
to]{.mark}]{.underline} raise collective output by 411,000 barrels per
day (bpd) in June[, [nearly triple the volume originally
scheduled]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The move]{.underline}]{.mark} follows
a similar surge announced for May and [[signals a sharp reversal from

Even though political leaders have expressed intentions to curb climate
change [[\[19\]]{.underline}](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629621004941#b0095) we
cannot necessarily expect a complete overhaul of our fossil-based
economy and energy system. The growth of carbon emissions has thus far
seemed unaffected by climate
pledges [[\[16\]]{.underline}](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629621004941#b0080).
[History shows that energy transitions, large scale shifts in the
production and use of energy, tend to be extremely

There seem to be good reasons to believe that the oil industry can
continue "business as usual"]{.underline} for years to come, while
perhaps slowly diversifying to new business areas alongside the
fossil-based core business The counterargument is that change is
essential to meet governments' commitments to tackle climate change and
achieve net-zero emissions A sustained reduction in oil demand in the
near future may seem extremely unlikely. But as such a scenario is part
of the discussion, included in the scenarios assessed by the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and those produced by many oil
companies
themselves [\[24\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629621004941#b0120), [\[25\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629621004941#b0125),
it is certainly prudent to consider what its implications might be. The
empirical research regarding how renewable energy adoption affects price
volatility shows mixed results along with scarce supporting evidence.
The majority of research in this field employs models that analyze oil
price volatility through geopolitical indices, structural VAR models and
supply-demand elasticity frameworks (Caldara & Iacoviello, 2022; Kilian
& Murphy, 2014). These models effectively analyze traditional price
stability factors but neglect or diminish the capability of renewables
to moderate price volatility. Research studies about clean energy
technologies and fossil fuel markets are increasing but remain in an
early development phase even though they demonstrate the interaction
between these two sectors. There is little research available that uses
data to specifically analyze the relationship between renewable energy
and oil price volatility within the United States [context. The research
seeks to resolve this knowledge deficit by testing whether U.S.
renewable energy consumption growth results in decreased crude oil price
volatility. The research analyzes data from 2002 to 2021 through
classification models combined with linear regressions and elasticity
estimations to examine how increased renewable energy use affects oil
price volatility in the United States. The analysis uses metrics such as
oil price volatility and renewable energy share as well as GDP growth
and geopolitical risk and oil market fundamentals (e.g., net imports and
domestic production) to test the hypothesis that renewable energy
expansion reduces U.S. oil price volatility]{.underline}. Academic
research into this relationship matters because it provides urgent
practical value. The transition to cleaner energy systems demands
knowledge about how renewable energy affects macroeconomic factors like
market stability[. Renewable energy adoption as a volatility-reducing
factor will strengthen the economic justification for green investments
while creating another compelling reason to speed up the energy
transition. The obtained knowledge enables policymakers to develop
better strategies for energy supply risk management and building
resilience in oil-importing economies as well as constructing unified
climate and energy frameworks that achieve environmental and economic
targets.]{.underline}

Conflict: Four Lessons Learned for the Oil Market", Center for Strategic
and International Studies,
<https://www.csis.org/analysis/iran-conflict-four-lessons-learned-oil-market>)

Sometimes long-feared [[events have little impact]{.underline}]{.mark}.
For many years, [[conflict over Iran]{.mark}'s nuclear
program]{.underline} [[threatened to]{.mark} place energy infrastructure
in the line of fire and [disrupt exports from the world's oil]{.mark}
and gas [heartland]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Yet when this
nightmare scenario came to pass, [[the oil market impact was
limited]{.mark}. [Traders were]{.mark}]{.underline} rightly
[[skeptical]{.mark} [that supply disruptions would
occur]{.mark}]{.underline}. [A modest [oil price bounce]{.mark} quickly
[disappeared]{.mark}]{.underline} when it became clear that Iran had no
appetite for an escalatory spiral, with Brent crude slipping back below
\$70 per barrel. Even [[war]{.mark} with Iran [failed to reshape oil
market]{.mark} sentiment]{.underline}---suggesting at least four
important lessons.

First, [the [oil market continues to shrug off geopolitical
risk.]{.mark}]{.underline} [Since the Hamas attacks on
Israel]{.underline} in October 2023, [there has been no shortage of
conflict in the Middle East]{.underline}. Yet [these [events have
consistently failed to disrupt supply.]{.mark}]{.underline} The market
is armed with information from tanker trackers and satellite
surveillance of production facilities, export terminals, pipelines, and
storage tanks. [If problems occur, [traders]{.mark} [know within minutes
or hours]{.mark}; otherwise[, they discount risks]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[This [shift]{.mark} in market sentiment [was
apparent]{.mark}]{.underline} as early as September 2019[, [when a price
spike]{.mark} following attacks on Saudi Arabia's Abqaiq
complex]{.underline}---one of the world's most important oil processing
facilities---[[quickly subsided as]{.mark} rapid [repairs]{.mark},
inventory [drawdowns]{.mark}, [and crude substitutions prevented
a]{.mark} supply [shortage]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the run-up to the
conflict in Iran, [[traders]{.mark} were [not]{.mark} [convinced that
Iran]{.mark} would [close the Strait of Hormuz]{.mark}]{.underline},
since [[doing so would choke off Iran's own oil exports]{.mark} and a
key source of export revenues.]{.underline} In short[, [the market has
adopted a "prove it" approach to supply risk]{.mark}. This is good news
for consumers, as [it]{.mark} [helps]{.mark} to [blunt market
volatility]{.mark} [and price run-ups]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Iran will not close the Strait of Hormuz

**Anand 25** -- (Saurav Anand, 06/20/2025, "Oil Prices Stable As Strait
Of Hormuz Remains Open; Global Surplus Of 0.9 mbpd, OPEC Spare Capacity
At 4 mbpd Supports Supply", The Economic Times Energyworld,
<https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/oil-and-gas/oil-prices-remain-steady-amid-gulf-tensions-and-strong-opec-capacity/121964487>)

New Delhi: Global crude oil prices have remained steady despite
heightened tensions in the Gulf region, with the Strait of
Hormuz---responsible for nearly 20 per cent of global oil
shipments---remaining operational.

According to a report by YES Securities, oil markets are currently
supported by a projected surplus of 0.9 million barrels per day (mbpd)
and a 4 mbpd spare production capacity held by OPEC.

The report noted that [[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}, which exports 1.5
mbpd of crude oil, [[has historically avoided actions that would
jeopardize its own oil shipments]{.mark} [or those of]{.mark} regional
[allies]{.mark} such as Iraq and Qatar.]{.underline} [[The
ongoing]{.mark} Iran-Israel [conflict has not led to a blockade of the
Strait of Hormuz, preventing any]{.mark} immediate [impact on oil
flows]{.mark} through the critical passage.]{.underline}

OPEC's spare production capacity of 4 mbpd remains significantly higher
than Iran's current export volume, providing a supply buffer to absorb
shocks. Additionally, US shale production continues to contribute to
global supply resilience, despite declining rig counts.

US shale output has increased even as rig activity has reduced, and
[[net US oil imports have declined]{.mark} consistently [over the past
decade]{.mark}.]{.underline} [This [shift has enabled global oil markets
to withstand regional tensions]{.mark} [that would]{.mark} previously
[have triggered sharp price spikes]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Demand-side projections have also moderated. Both the International
Energy Agency (IEA) and the US Energy Information Administration (EIA)
have revised their 2025 global oil demand growth forecasts. IEA now
expects demand to increase by 0.72 mbpd and EIA projects 0.8 mbpd
growth, down from earlier estimates of 1 mbpd. Factors influencing this
revision include China's slower post-COVID recovery, growing electric
vehicle adoption, and fuel efficiency improvements.

[On the export front, [Iranian oil shipments]{.mark}---primarily routed
to China---[are continuing without major
disruption]{.mark}.]{.underline} The report noted that [unless there is
a full blockade of the Strait of Hormuz or physical damage to Gulf
energy infrastructure, Brent crude prices are unlikely to remain above
USD 80 per barrel on a sustained basis.]{.underline}

The report concluded that while the geopolitical environment remains
tense, [[current supply dynamics]{.underline}]{.mark}, including OPEC
capacity and US shale resilience, [[are expected to keep oil prices
relatively stable in the near term.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Enverus Intelligence^®^ Research (EIR) holds the position that [global
oil demand will not peak or decline before the end of this
decade]{.underline}. EIR's analysis offers a [distinct and unbiased
viewpoint, diverging from]{.underline} the two benchmarks forecasters;
[OPEC and the]{.underline} International Energy Agency
([IEA]{.underline}). The IEA's most optimistic scenario predicts that
global oil demand will stabilize at around 105 million barrels per day
by 2030, while scenarios aiming for net-zero emissions propose a
significantly lower demand. In contrast, OPEC anticipates an increase to
112 million barrels per day by 2030. Currently sitting at roughly 103
million barrels per day, [Enverus]{.underline} Intelligence®[ Research's
projection points towards a demand of 108 million barrels per day by
2030.]{.underline} This estimate finds a middle ground among the varying
predictions, but not by coincidence or through compromise.

EIR has conducted a detailed bottoms-up analysis and found that fuel
economy standards aren't as effective as mandated, while factoring in
current electric vehicle sales momentum. Lastly, EIR has adopted
consensus estimates for the impact of single-use plastic bans on oil
consumption to arrive at our result. Overall, both [OPEC and IEA
estimates require a significant change in consumption behavior or a
reversal of off-oil measures over a short period]{.underline}. History
is not in their favor. Our demand forecast results in a world where
OPEC's influence on oil price strengthens, supporting the group's
preference for prices of \$85/bbl to \$105/bbl. As for when [peak demand
will occur,]{.underline} we suspect it occurs [between 2030 and
2035]{.underline} as supply costs and availability may combine with
off-oil measures to curb consumption in the first half of the next
decade.  

#### At worst, it'll peak after 2030

The IEA still expects [global oil demand]{.underline} to [reach a
plateau by the end of this decade]{.underline}. Demand is growing by
about 700,000 barrels per day annually in the near term, but that growth
will taper off.

[By 2030, demand is projected to rise by only 2.5 million barrels per
day]{.underline} in total. Meanwhile, production capacity is expected to
increase by 5 million barrels per day---twice the amount
needed---raising concerns about a potential supply glut.

Driving the demand slowdown:

Electric vehicles: EVs are expected to displace 5.5 million barrels/day
by 2030 (up from just 1 million in 2024).

Behavioral shifts: Remote work is saving approximately 1 million
barrels/day of commuting-related fuel use.

Middle East transitions: Power generation in countries like Saudi
Arabia is shifting away from oil to gas and renewables, cutting demand
by nearly 1 million barrels/day.

Petrochemicals and Aviation Keep Demand Afloat

While transport fuels are declining, [sectors
like petrochemicals and aviation are still expanding. Oil-based
feedstocks like naphtha and ethane are crucial for plastics and
synthetic fibers---areas less prone to substitution.]{.underline}

"[Petrochemicals are more resilient to the pressures reducing transport
demand]{.underline}," Bosoni noted. "As urbanization and consumer demand
grow, especially in emerging markets, [this sector will remain a key
demand driver]{.underline}."

In Hubbert's time, most of the conventional oil reserves had already
been discovered. [Hubbert went on to predict that U.S. production would
peak in 1969, and it did appear to peak in 1970.]{.underline} World
reserves were supposed to peak around 2010 (see figure).

However[, about 20 years ago, the [industry]{.mark} really [**leapt**
forward on]{.mark} the [tech]{.mark}nologies to find oil and to extract
it. **[Particularly fracking]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[This changed everything.]{.underline}

**barrel**]{.underline}]{.mark} [of oil consumed over the past 35 years,
[**two new barrels** have been discovered]{.mark}.]{.underline}" And
this shows [[no]{.mark} sign of [slowing down]{.mark} any time
[soon]{.mark}. Peak oil has moved to a long time from now.]{.underline}

While we talk about decreasing our fossil fuel use, it's easy to forget
that [humans find it really hard not to use what they have a lot
of.]{.underline} And we have a lot of oil. And gas. And coal. In fact,
the United States has more oil, gas and coal together than any other
country in the world.

reservoirs.  He assumed that all crude oil reservoirs capable of being
produced were known in the 1960's. ]{.underline} As a result, [Hubbert
incorrectly assumed the volume of]{.underline} recoverable [crude oil
would be finite and,]{.underline} at a future point in time, world crude
oil supplies [would fully deplete.]{.underline}

P[eak oil's flaw was failing to account for new technologies that would
allow crude oil to be produced from rock strata]{.underline} previously
deemed to hold no recoverable crude oil reserves.

Two examples illustrate this point.  First, [advancements in offshore
drilling technology, dynamic positioning equipment, and floating
production and drilling units have made offshore crude oil reserves
viable]{.underline} that were previously unreachable.  Globally,
offshore crude oil production accounted for about 30 percent of total
crude oil production over the past decade.

Second, shale rock was previously considered to be impermeable rock
strata incapable of yielding up either crude oil or gas.  However,
George Mitchell, the father of shale production, combined two previously
known technologies (i.e., [horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing)
spurring the shale revolution in the United States.]{.underline}

How do these developments affect Utahns?  The mechanism for crude oil
price determination has shifted.  [The floor price for crude oil appears
to be set at \$25-\$35 per barrel because]{.underline} the
[economies]{.underline} of some OPEC members [are not sufficiently
robust enough to withstand long periods at lower crude oil price
levels.]{.underline}  At the other extreme, the price ceiling for crude
oil appears to be set at \$70-\$80 per barrel because U.S. shale
producers demonstrated that they can profitably operate at those crude
oil price levels.  Possible scenarios under which this outlook may
falter include global conflicts that impede global crude oil supplies or
disruptive renewable energy technologies that replace fossil fuels.

Peak oil, a hypothetical point when global oil production maximizes and
enters an irreversible decline, has been the holy grail of resource
economics for decades: prized and just as elusive. Recently,
[technological development including increased digitization has altered
conventional understandings associated with "peak oil".]{.underline}
Like other consumable resources, peak oil is grounded in reality: Oil is
a finite natural resource produced over a geological timespan whereas
demand continues to climb. However, peak oil could also become a
self-fulfilling prophecy, inadvertently misinforming the public.

When this author was about 10 (more than 50 years ago), his father, an
oil and gas Ph.D. geologist, told him that we will run out of oil, as
all major fields have been already discovered.

How we react to this prophecy will determine a lot about decarbonization
and the energy transition.

[Nobody can quite agree on when we will reach the point of Peak
Oil]{.underline} or even what will cause it. Norwegian state-owned oil
company [Equinor]{.underline} and energy researcher Rystad Energy
[predict a peak around 2028]{.underline} owing to low investments in oil
supply and increasingly efficient competition from renewable energy
projects. [McKinsey]{.underline} Consulting and French oil and gas
company TotalEnergies, [estimate peak oil in the early and
mid-2030s]{.underline} respectively due to slow growth in the chemical
industries as well as peak transport demand.

A recent [OPEC outlook report estimated steadily increasing demand,
which would result in peak oil in approximately 2040]{.underline}. The
International Energy Agency and U.S. Energy Information Agency foresee
oil demand "plateauing" and recommend immediately exploring alternatives
to sustain energy needs. According to [BP's outlook,]{.underline}
international oil demand may double as the developing world buys more
ICE cars and builds Western-style consumer societies, and [peak oil not
hit until 2050 based on known oil resources with the application of
today's technology.]{.underline}

Extremely [knowledgeable professionals cannot agree on the basic
mechanisms or timing of peak oil.]{.underline} This is not a new trend.
American geoscientist Marion King [Hubbert]{.underline}
[predicted]{.underline} that [global crude-oil production would peak in
2000.]{.underline} Sadad Ibrahim Al Husseini of Saudi Aramco predicted
that Peak Oil occurred in 2006. A UK Parliamentary task force concluded
it had been 2013. [There are hundreds of more faulty
predictions]{.underline} that could be enumerated, [but the shared fault
in all these forecasts is a failure to recognize oil production as
inherently political, and providing geological answers is]{.underline}
vital but [not sufficient.]{.underline}

### UQ AT: Trump Shale

#### Trump won't immediately increase production

Mike **Soraghan 24**, enterprise and investigative reporter, primarily
on oil and gas, for E&E News, "4 things Trump can --- and can't --- do
to boost oil and gas," 11/19/24,
https://www.eenews.net/articles/4-things-trump-can-and-cant-do-to-boost-oil-and-gas/

The day after the election, Trump spokesperson Jason Miller told the
"Today" show that the first thing the new administration will do is "get
back to drilling."

But **[[don't expect a traffic jam of oil rigs]{.mark} on Inauguration
Day]{.underline}**. Despite what Trump has said, U.S. oil and gas
production is setting records.

And [more production]{.mark} right now likely [would hurt the]{.mark}
oil companies' [bottom line]{.mark}.

Trump has promised to "drill, baby, drill" to bring gasoline prices
below \$2 a gallon, specifically mentioning a past price of \$1.87. To
get there, the benchmark price of U.S. oil would have to fall by more
than two-thirds from its current perch at about \$70 a barrel. Oil
executives may like the slogan, but they don't want to produce so much
they create a glut and lower prices.

"They're not going to produce just so we can have \$2 gas," said Frank
Maisano, a senior principal at Bracewell who represents clients in the
oil and gas industry as well as in renewables.

And, outside of a national emergency, [the]{.mark} federal [government
**[cannot force companies to drill]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[more]{.underline}**.

**[[Market factors]{.underline}]{.mark}** right now, such as reduced
Asian consumption and OPEC countries considering a production increase,
[mean]{.mark} oil [companies aren't going to]{.mark} want to [raise
production]{.mark}, said Ed Hirs, a University of Houston energy
economist.

"**[[The capital is not there]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The market is
softening," Hirs said. "**[It's not going to happen]{.underline}**."

Gasoline prices are nowhere near \$1.87, but they're pretty low in
relative terms.

On Monday, the fuel-price-tracking service GasBuddy put the national
average gasoline price at \$3.02 per gallon, the lowest level since May
2021. The average has fallen for five straight weeks. The GasBuddy
average is down more than 15 cents from a month ago and over 27 cents
from a year ago.

That might be why, in their statements congratulating Trump on his
victory, most industry trade groups didn't echo his call for more
drilling and production.

The American Petroleum Institute, for example, called for an
"all-of-the-above" strategy and "bipartisan solutions that unleash
American energy as a driver of economic prosperity, environmental
progress and stability around the world."

Despite Trump's political rhetoric --- Maisano called it "sloganeering"
--- what angered oil executives under Biden were policies and planning
decisions that could restrict oil and gas development years down the
road.

Trump is likely to immediately take steps to increase the amount of
public land and water offered for oil and gas development, though it
remains up to oil and gas companies to bid in federal oil lease sales
that can take years to develop.

Biden froze new oil and gas leasing in 2021. A federal judge forced
Biden to resume sales, but auctions have been small and less frequent
than historic norms.

Mike Sommers, CEO of API, noted in a call with reporters last week that
2024 is the first year since 1966 that the federal government hasn't
held an offshore lease sale in the Gulf of Mexico.

The unleashing that API officials seek would mean fewer regulations,
more access to land for leasing and stripping away Biden's environmental
regulations. For oil and gas companies, that **[may or may not mean more
drilling]{.underline}**, but it could translate into higher profits.

"[I don't think]{.mark} the level of [production]{.mark} in the U.S.
[is]{.mark} being **[[constrained by external
restrictions]{.underline}]{.mark}**," **[[Exxon]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Mobil **[[CEO]{.underline}]{.mark}** Darren [**[Woods]{.underline}**
told CNBC]{.mark} in an interview this month. He said he was "not sure
how 'drill, baby, drill' translates into policy."

#### The industry is [reducing]{.underline} capital expenditure despite Trump

Tsvetana **Paraskova 24**, writer for oilprice.com, "U.S. Oil Industry
Hesitates as Trump Promises Energy Revolution," 12/12/24,
https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/US-Oil-Industry-Hesitates-as-Trump-Promises-Energy-Revolution.html

The industry, through the American Petroleum Institute (API), has
released a five-point policy roadmap---suggestions for the new
administration to boost resource development and exports, issue a new
five-year federal offshore leasing program, and repeal the EPA's vehicle
tailpipe rule.

To a large extent, this wish list aligns with the policy changes Trump
has pledged and is widely expected to enact, many of these on day one.

However, a key Trump campaign slogan -- "**[[drill, baby,
drill]{.underline}]{.mark}**" -- [is n]{.mark}ot necessarily [on the
minds of]{.mark} U.S. oil and gas company [executives]{.mark}.

The [priorities]{.mark} of the U.S. oil industry [have **[drastically
changed]{.underline}**]{.mark} since Trump's first term.

[The U.S]{.mark}. shale patch is drilling, but it is drilling because it
wants to distribute more of the profits to shareholders. It [has made
**[huge progress]{.underline}** in **[capital discipline]{.underline}**
and efficiency gains]{.mark} and is getting more bang for its buck.
Priorities are now returns to investors and financial frames capable of
withstanding oil price volatility.

"We\'re not going to see anybody in \'drill, baby, drill\' mode,\"
ExxonMobil Upstream President Liam Mallon said at the end of last month.

"[A radical change (in production) is unlikely]{.mark} because the vast
majority, if not everybody, is focused on the economics of what they\'re
doing," Mallon added.

The other U.S. supermajor, [Chevron]{.mark}, [announced]{.mark} last
week that its 2025 capital expenditure ([capex]{.mark}) [would be
**[lower than]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[in [2024]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

### 1NC Climate (General)

#### Successful climate policy curtails demand for Middle Eastern [oil imports]{.underline}. Collapses prices and [turns emissions]{.underline}. 

**Al-Sarihi 23**, \*PhD, a former associate at KAPSARC. \*\*PhD, senior
associate in the Utilities and Renewables program @ KAPSARC. (\*Aisha
and \*\*Salaheddine Soummane, "Impacts of Global Climate Policies on
Middle Eastern Oil Exporters: A Review of Economic Implications and
Mitigation Strategies," p. 6-11, DOI: 10.30573/KS\--2022-DP16)

[This review of empirical studies confirms that [Middle Eastern oil
exporters are **negatively impacted** by low]{.mark} oil [prices and
**require sustained oil rents**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, [oil
[rents]{.mark} not only [support]{.mark} growth but also [the **social
welfare system**]{.mark}]{.underline} linking oil exporting countries'
governments to their populations (Fattouh and Sen 2021).
[This]{.underline} welfare system [consists]{.underline} mainly
[[of]{.mark} public sector [employment]{.mark}, low taxation,
[and]{.mark} other social [transfers]{.mark}]{.underline} (Hertog 2017).
Welfare schemes are common in all resource-exporting countries, but they
are particularly robust in oil exporting countries (Ross 2015). This
redistribution of oil rents results in economic inefficiencies.
Nevertheless, high oil revenues allow the GCC countries to achieve
strong macroeconomic, fiscal and political stability (Elbadawi and
Makdisi 2020). In turn, [declining rents may create
**acute**]{.underline} political [**instability** in these
countries]{.underline}. Bjorvatn and Naghavi (2011) show that
significant [declines in **oil rents** may]{.underline} significantly
[increase the possibility of **internal conflict**]{.underline}. Rent
seeking is more likely to affect these countries when rents are less
abundant.

**[Advanced]{.underline}** global **[climate policies]{.underline}** are
expected to [create risks like those associated with declining **oil
prices**]{.underline} for oil exporting countries. These potential risks
were first acknowledged in 1992 in Article 4.8 of the treaty that
established the UNFCCC (U.N. 1992). The Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC 2014) reaffirmed that climate mitigation policies
may create revenue losses for fossil fuel exporters by devaluing fossil
fuel assets. Middle Eastern oil exporters are therefore viewed as
opposing advances in climate negotiations (Depledge 2008). However, the
global consensus regarding the need for urgent measures to reduce
emissions is growing. Thus, some nations, including major oil exporters,
have recently shifted from opposing climate policies to becoming more
receptive to them (Al-Sarihi and Mason 2020; Ramady and Mahdi 2015).

Global [[climate policies to **reduce**]{.underline}]{.mark} overall
carbon dioxide **[[emissions]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and meet the PA's
objectives [**pose a threat** to]{.mark} Middle Eastern [oil
exporters]{.mark}. These policies will significantly alter the outlook
for oil demand]{.underline} and prices, [[putting]{.mark} **more
[stress]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} oil [exporters' **state
budgets**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Researchers have developed different oil
demand outlooks that are in line with the PA's objectives. Ansari, Holz
and Al-Kuhlani (2019) and Dagnachew et al. (2019) provide comparative
analyses of these various energy outlooks. A widely referenced demand
outlook that is consistent with the PA is the Sustainable Development
Scenario (SDS) created by the International Energy Agency (IEA) (2019).
In this scenario, global oil demand is 35.6 million barrels per day
(MMb/d) in 2040, or 32.6% lower than its level in the reference
scenario. [**[Mitigating]{.mark}** the [use of fossil fuels will]{.mark}
**significantly [curtail]{.mark} oil [demand]{.mark}** in major
importers of Middle Eastern oil]{.underline} (Table 2).

Most of the gap between the SDS and the reference scenario comes from
the transport sector. This sector's oil demand is 27.0 MMb/d lower in
the SDS than in the reference scenario. The difference stems from a
combination of fuel efficiency improvements and electric mobility
penetration (IEA 2019). Many countries have pledged to ban cars with
internal combustion engines in the coming years and have provided
incentives to increase electric vehicle use (Burch and Gilchrist 2018).
These policies are expected to increase the electric vehicle stock to
almost 900 million units by 2040, displacing 9.2 MMb/d of oil demand
(IEA 2017).

The potential economic consequences of the data in Table 2 remain
uncertain. Even in scenarios in line with the PA, such as the SDS of the
IEA (2020a), the decline in oil demand is not steep. Notably, demand in
developing countries, such as China and India, will decline more slowly.
In the SDS, oil consumption by non-OECD countries decreases by 0.6% per
year on average between 2019 and 2040. Consumption will be only 5.5
MMb/d less than current consumption at this horizon (i.e., 46.8 MMb/d
vs. 41.3 MMb/d) (IEA 2020a). Thus, demand in developing countries will
remain well above OPEC's current production level of about 35 MMb/d (BP
2020).2 [Climate policy will play a **critical role** in shaping
importing countries' demand]{.underline}. However, Middle Eastern
exports will also depend on resource availability, competitiveness, and
policies in other oil exporting regions (Finley 2012).

If global efforts to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions significantly
impact oil demand, oil prices may fall. In the SDS, oil prices stabilize
at \$53/b (in 2019 dollars) by 2040, 43% less than in the IEA's (2020a)
reference scenario. Even if oil prices decline to this level, all Middle
Eastern countries can continue to derive substantial rents from oil
exports. Their production costs are a fraction of even the lowest
projected oil prices.3 However, this market-based logic provides only a
partial picture of the possible outcomes (Dale and Fattouh 2018). [The
simple break-even oil price]{.underline} (i.e., the price at which
selling oil generates a profit) [is distinct from the fiscal break-even
oil price. The latter price is that required to achieve the planned
spending in the state budget.]{.underline}

[The fiscal break-even price is **more relevant**]{.underline} for many
Middle Eastern oil exporters [because oil is their predominant source of
**public income.**]{.underline} Thus, it is the appropriate metric for
analyzing the economic implications of potential oil price declines in
Middle Eastern countries. For the five largest Middle Eastern oil
exporters in OPEC,4 the average physical extraction cost is reported to
be about \$10/b (Dale and Fattouh 2018). However, the fiscal break-even
prices for these countries are higher and have remained well above
international oil prices in recent years (Table 3).

Some Middle Eastern oil exporters have significantly reduced their
fiscal break-even prices. However, these reductions did not result from
broad structural reforms (Arezki et al. 2018). They were instead mainly
driven by cyclical measures, such as reducing public spending and
utilizing financial reserves accumulated when oil prices were high.
Moreover, unlike many commodity exporters, Middle Eastern oil exporters
anchor their currencies to the United States dollar (or to baskets of
currencies, as do Kuwait and Iran). These currency pegs limit
policymakers' ability to use independent monetary policy to stabilize
shocks, leaving only fiscal actions as possible stabilization tools
(Wills and van der Ploeg 2014).

These cyclical measures have not brought fiscal break-even prices below
or even close to international oil prices. Thus, Middle Eastern oil
exporters' fiscal indicators have deteriorated. In 2014, the average
government fiscal balance for the five oil exporters listed in Table 3
was a surplus of 2.8% of gross domestic product (GDP). By 2016, they had
an average deficit of 7.2% of GDP. Although their fiscal balances
improved by 2019, with deficits amounting to 0.9% of GDP on average,
these countries' overall public debt rose significantly. Whereas debt
represented only 12.4% of GDP on average across the five countries in
2014, it reached 31.6% of GDP on average in 2019. These debt levels are
moderate by international standards. However, this rapid deterioration
linked with declining oil price raises questions about their future
sustainability. Ultimately, the development outlooks for oil exporting
countries are uncertain owing to increasingly stringent climate
policies.

Assessing the economic implications of advanced global climate policies
for oil exporting countries is a major focus of policymakers,
particularly in the Middle East (Barnett 2008; Ramady and Mahdi 2015).
These implications are among the most debated topics in climate
negotiations. Various modeling tools are used to determine whether
climate policies will create economic losses or benefits for oil
exporters and the magnitudes of these impacts. The models' results
depend on a wide range of modeling characteristics, including the
regional breakdown, the scope of emissions, and the time horizon.
Various assumptions that cannot be determined with certainty may also
alter the models' outcomes. For instance, models use different
assumptions about the coverage of international policy regimes. The
ability to substitute between various energy sources and the costs of
doing so vary across models. Models assume different rates of
technological innovation and future energy supply availability as well
(Ansari, Holz and Al-Kuhlani 2019; Dagnachew et al. 2019; Nikas, Doukas
and Papandreou 2019).

Barnett, Dessai and Webber (2004) review six different estimates of the
expected implications of the Kyoto Protocol for oil exporting countries
published in 1999 and 2000. The Kyoto Protocol aimed to reduce the
emissions of 37 industrialized countries. All six models indicate that
oil exporting countries will suffer losses if climate policies are
implemented in industrialized countries. The specific estimates of these
losses differ across the six models owing to their different approaches
and assumptions. However, the expected losses from the Kyoto Protocol's
implementation compared to a business-as-usual scenario are generally
estimated to be about 10% of oil revenues. Table 4 provides an updated
literature review, presenting estimates from models of climate policy
impacts published since 2003.

Seven of the nine studies referenced in Table 4 find that [climate
policies mainly result in **losses** for **oil exporting
countries**]{.underline}. Moreover, [these seven studies suggest that
[Middle Eastern countries bear the **highest mitigation costs**]{.mark}
if climate policies are implemented]{.underline}. These costs may be
measured as shares of oil export revenues or as shares of GDP. The high
mitigation costs arise because [the Middle East is **highly dependent**
on oil revenues]{.underline}. The models typically find that the revenue
losses for Middle Eastern oil exporters result from oil price declines
rather than from export volume reductions. Indeed, the region has
abundant and cost-competitive conventional oil reserves, meaning that
its exports are unlikely to drastically decline. [[Middle Eastern
countries]{.mark} can leverage this cost advantage to increase oil
exports **now**, [under the threat of an **accelerated energy
transition**]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, doing so [[may **flood the
market** and drive]{.mark} oil [prices even lower]{.mark}]{.underline},
thereby **[[aggravating]{.mark} oil [rent losses]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Waisman, Rozenberg and Hourcade 2013).5

Yet the regional and local [economics of **oil**]{.underline} and gas

nationwide where current production may become non-competitive over the
next two decades as the shrinking market eliminates high-cost producers.

Our interactive national map explores the magnitude of estimated
non-competitive oil and gas production and the potential losses of
associated tax revenue and sectoral jobs associated with reduced future
production for a range of future dates and different scenarios.
[[Cost-**competitiveness** is]{.underline}]{.mark} but [one of [numerous
factor]{.mark}s that [influence oil]{.mark} and gas
**[productio]{.mark}n**]{.underline}, with myriad considerations like
access to markets, local policies, or product characteristics affecting
operational decision-making. Even so, by spatially visualizing and
quantifying the potential impacts faced by higher-cost producers, our
interactive map can serve as a guide for local policy makers and
community stakeholders seeking to assess future economic risks.

4.5 Two stylized scenarios

To better illustrate our theoretical framework, we conclude this section
with two stylized scenarios using the concepts and channels presented
above. We distinguish between: (a) a smooth orderly transition; (b) a
disruptive transition. Both scenarios start from the same point.
[[**Renewable** electricity]{.mark} and heat, low-emission
**[transport]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [energy-[efficient retrofits,
and]{.mark}]{.underline} other [[low-carbon products
**proliferate**]{.mark} as relative prices **tilt in their favor**,
[driven by **climate policies**]{.mark}]{.underline},
**[tech]{.underline}**nological **[change]{.underline}**, [and changes
in **preferences**]{.underline} and behavior.

A disruptive transition scenario could ensue if an ever-larger
discrepancy arises between this direction of technological trajectory
and sunset industry investment. [[Firms continue developing fossil
reserves]{.mark}, building pipelines, transformation plants, and
internal combustion engine factories, possibly [egged on by beliefs of
oil demand rebound]{.mark}, that are shared by a sufficient number of
financial investors. These beliefs could]{.underline} in turn [be
[supported by **uneven** and **erratic** climate **policies**]{.mark},
highly publicized low-carbon technological setbacks, [vested
interests]{.mark} bound up with]{.underline} at least [a semblance of
"**business as usual**" in the high-carbon sectors [and bias]{.mark}ed
information]{.underline} as prominent forecasters and scenarios
reinforce shared beliefs. [[As]{.mark} large [investments become
**sunk**]{.mark} and **committed**, [**returns do not materialize** due
to **tougher** low-carbon competition]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus,
[**persistently [low]{.mark}** fossil fuel **[prices]{.mark}** and
**insufficient demand** for high carbon products [**erode cash flows**
and **destabilize**]{.mark} **large [balance sheets]{.mark}**. Stock
market valuations]{.underline}, still reflecting the belief of a
high-carbon future, [become vulnerable to **sudden changes** in
expectations.]{.underline}

[[Disorder could then be triggered by]{.underline}]{.mark}, for
instance, a disruptive event affecting one of the transition drivers.
This could be a large-scale climatic event (e.g., unprecedented heat
waves) that creates a generalized sense of urgency, leading to an
"inevitable policy response" (PRI, 2020). This might take the form of
[[a **rapid**]{.mark} and [**unanticipated** increase in]{.mark} the
[**price** on]{.mark} the **[carbon]{.mark}**]{.underline} content of
goods or highly restrictive regulation. [Transition [costs
**jump**]{.mark} upwards and [firms]{.mark} re-evaluate their earnings
prospect and [write off assets. Banks re-assess]{.mark} the performance
of their fossil-related [loans]{.mark} and write off]{.underline}
substantial shares of [their assets]{.underline} in turn. [Equity
[investors]{.mark}]{.underline} may [[react]{.mark} faster, anticipating
the market-woes, and jettison high-carbon firm financial
investments]{.underline}, whereby **[market [valuation
collapses]{.mark}]{.underline}**. At this point, the full chain of
events described in the previous subsections could play out.

Amid the dizzying acceleration of headlines and debate about the vital
global [[transition to renewable]{.mark} energy]{.underline}, new
research shows how that change [[could **destabilize**]{.mark} **dozens
of [fragile states]{.mark}** [that **depend**]{.mark} **heavily [on oil
exports]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The new study underscores that
governments and international institutions will need to guard against
risks that the shift away from carbon-heavy fuels will inadvertently
upset political balances and potentially ignite violent conflicts in a
swath of nations from Venezuela to Nigeria to Iraq and beyond. Above
all, the research suggests, the world must avoid [an **[unplanned
"traumatic decarbonization"]{.mark}** of these economies]{.underline}.

The U.S. recommitment to the Paris climate accords --- plus summit
conferences called by the Biden administration, the G7 nations and NATO
--- reflect the reality that countries are moving to cut their oil
consumption in hope of constraining the planet's warming. Politicians in
the world's more comfortably developed nations focus on managing this
transition to serve their own economies and polities, meeting costs and
generating jobs, with an eye toward winning the next election.

Where [[Oil **Buys Stability**]{.underline}]{.mark}

Yet fragile states that produce a large share of the world's oil face a
different, more acute problem set. [Their [leaders]{.mark}]{.underline},
rarely confronted with true electoral challenges, [**[pursue political
survival]{.mark}** instead [by **cutting deals among**]{.mark}
**contentious and often [violent]{.mark} elite
[factions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The deals typically [involve]{.mark}
material benefits **linked to [the cash from oil]{.mark}
exports.**]{.underline} When these countries face a sudden cutoff of
their cash flow, leaders must either bargain --- or battle --- for
slices of a smaller pie.

A challenge for U.S. and allied policymakers is that [a
[greening]{.mark} of the global economy **[creates]{.mark} new risks for
[violence on a global scale]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Violent conflict
already has been rising for a decade, driven [by spikes in civil
unrest](https://visionofhumanity.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GPI_2020_web.pdf) and
again this month [resetting the
record](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/06/1094292) for human
displacement --- now 82.4 million people worldwide. And we know already
that a transition to [renewable and other
low-carbon](https://www.mcecleanenergy.org/news/whats-the-difference-between-carbon-free-renewable-energy/) energy
sources will risk [igniting unintended
conflicts](https://www.usip.org/publications/2021/04/green-economy-risks-new-conflicts-thats-avoidable) around
the mining of minerals that will be essential to green technologies. The
new research, still being synthesized, suggests that [closing the
planet's oil spigot will [generate]{.mark} simultaneous new [risks in
**dozens**]{.mark} **of countries** [whose]{.mark} collective
[population will be]{.mark} **counted [in the
billions.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[In fragile states, governance [institutions are
**weak**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Rather than functioning under the rule of
law, politics centers on transactional bargains among rival members of
the elite. How the bargains operate varies from country to country. The
specific mechanisms may be legal or illegal under national laws. [There
may be **overt [corruption]{.mark}**[, **cronyism or**
]{.mark}**structural [oligarchies]{.mark}**, a combination of all three,
or other less detectable tactics]{.underline}. A common feature,
however, is that [the [oil]{.mark} sector [is]{.mark} typically
**[controlled]{.mark}**, entirely or overwhelmingly, **[by]{.mark} the
members of [the elite]{.mark} who hold the levers of state
power.**]{.underline} [No matter the mechanism, oil money is **[central
to]{.mark} elite [deals with implications for
stability.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

The connection between oil prices and peacemaking in oil-dependent
countries is visible in data. [Since 1990, the new research finds, [high
oil prices **accompany** ]{.mark}**broader, [stronger peacemaking
processes]{.mark}** in such countries]{.underline}. Higher oil revenues
in the 2000s funded "big-tent" patronage politics in which rivals have
greater incentive to cooperate for a slice of the cash pie. Leaders can
spread around oil-derived cash to pay off foes and keep allies loyal.
[[When oil]{.mark} prices [slumped in the 2010s, peace]{.mark}
agreements **[became thinner]{.mark}** --- often merely cease-fire
accords]{.underline}. The lack of cash to pay off factions left rival
groups more often to chase their goals through unstable, shorter-term
deals, or simply by continuing armed conflict, which itself is often
part of the bargaining process.

[The [transition to]{.mark} the global [green economy]{.mark} will not
simply unleash power struggles over existing resources in oil-pumping
fragile states. It also [will push]{.mark} those countries' [elites to
seek new revenues]{.mark}. The new research suggests that [the
**scrambles**]{.mark} **for alternate income streams**]{.underline} ---
ranging from legally obtained natural resources to illicit activities
--- [[will **create**]{.mark} further, specific
**[risks]{.mark}**]{.underline}. An example: When Sudan lost oil income
after the secession of South Sudan, Sudanese leaders found replacement
incomes partly by renting their mercenary forces to Middle Eastern
states that used them in the wars in Libya and Yemen.

#### Oil prices lower as demand declines

As with any commodity, stock, or bond, [the laws of supply
and demand cause oil prices to change. When supply exceeds demand,
prices fall;]{.underline} the inverse is also true when demand outpaces
supply.

[The dramatic drop in oil prices in 2014]{.underline} has been
[attributed to lower demand for oil]{.underline} in Europe and China,
coupled with a steady supply of oil from OPEC.5 The excess supply of oil
caused oil prices to fall sharply. Financial crises, like the Great
Recession of 2008, can also cause gas and oil prices to fall
drastically.

#### Increasing renewables decreases the demand and price of oil

Ranger Minerals, 05-02-2025; Accessed 7-14-2025
https://www.rangerminerals.com/how-renewable-energy-growth-affects-the-oil-and-gas-royalty-market/\]

The renewable energy sector has been expanding rapidly over the past two
decades, driven by a combination of factors, including advances in
technology, declining costs, and growing concerns about climate change.
Solar and wind energy, in particular, have seen extraordinary growth and
are now often the cheapest sources of new electricity generation in many
regions around the world. This shift has been accelerated by policy
support, such as government subsidies, tax incentives, and international
agreements like the Paris Climate Accords.

[Renewable energy's growth is contributing to a diversification of
global energy production]{.underline}. While fossil fuels, particularly
[oil]{.underline} and natural gas, remain dominant, their [share in the
global energy mix is starting to decrease as renewables take center
stage]{.underline}. In this context, the oil and gas royalty market
faces new challenges and opportunities as it adjusts to the changing
energy landscape.

The oil and gas royalty market is largely influenced by factors such as
global oil prices, exploration and production levels, and the regulatory
framework surrounding extraction activities. [As renewables become more
competitive, there are implications for both the supply of and demand
for fossil fuels]{.underline}, with knock-on effects on the financial
mechanisms that underpin the industry.

The Relationship Between Oil Prices and Royalty Revenues

One of the most direct ways in which [the growth of renewable energy
affects]{.underline} the oil and gas royalty market is through its
impact on global [oil prices. The relationship between oil prices and
royalty revenues is **well-established**:]{.underline} when oil prices
rise, royalty payments tend to increase, as oil-producing regions
receive a larger share of the revenues generated from oil production.
Conversely, [when oil prices fall, royalties also decline]{.underline},
leading to a decrease in the overall revenue generated by oil and gas
production.

[As renewable energy sources]{.underline} continue to
[replace]{.underline} conventional [fossil fuels]{.underline} in
electricity generation[, global demand for oil]{.underline} may
eventually [start to decline.]{.underline} The immediate impact of this
could be seen in oil prices, as [lower demand may lead to price
volatility or]{.underline} even [prolonged downturns]{.underline}. For
oil-producing regions, this would mean a reduction in royalty payments,
affecting both governments and landowners who rely on royalties as a
source of income.

Furthermore, the decreasing competitiveness of fossil fuels may drive
oil producers to reduce their exploration and extraction activities,
particularly if they anticipate that renewable energy will continue to
grow and further reduce demand for oil. This could lead to a decline in
oil production levels, which, in turn, would also negatively impact
royalty revenues, as less oil being extracted means fewer royalties to
distribute.

#### **Renewables [compete]{.underline} with oil---decimates oil prices** 

**Elbin 23** \[Saul; Staff writer for The Hill over science, climate,
and Texas; 12/10/2023, "Renewables' growing price advantage over fossil
fuels paves way for industry dominance," The Hill;

iman

**[[Renewables are]{.mark} reaching the point where they are
[outcompeting fossil fuels on price]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- [[setting
the stage for]{.mark} their predicted [dominance of the energy
sector]{.mark} by midcentury.]{.underline}

When it comes to the surging demand for new electric generation, wind
and solar prices are now the cheapest options almost everywhere,
according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Building new wind and solar projects is also cheaper than running
existing coal plants, according to a report from Energy Innovation, a
nonpartisan climate policy think tank.

**[The fall in price has led to a global rush to install new wind and
solar]{.underline}** --- which the IEA noted expanded by nearly 25
percent in 2023, powered by record installations.

[And the IEA added that prices are falling further]{.underline} ---
particularly in the U.S., where the tax credits from the Democrats' 2022
clean energy stimulus will begin to take full effect in 2024.

In 2021 --- before the passage of the sweeping subsidies for clean
energy included in that stimulus --- the U.S. government estimated that
no matter what, solar power was likely to make up half of U.S. electric
generation by midcentury.

The country is passing a "tipping point" beyond which renewables are the
status quo option, said Timothy Lenton, chair of the climate department
at the University of Exeter.

Lenton said that by midcentury, even if climate policies remain no more
generous than they are now, renewables will make up three-quarters of
U.S. electricity production.

This level of renewable adoption, he argued, is becoming the floor of
global ambition, not the ceiling. At the United Nations climate
conference (COP28) in Dubai last week, the U.S. joined 110 other nations
in agreeing to triple renewable energy production.

"And if you add more climate policies, it will only go faster," Lenton
said, noting this level of growth was becoming both exponential and
"hard to stop."

"There's a self-propelling, ever stronger feedback loop behind the
transformation," he said. The question now, he said, isn't whether the
change is going to happen. "Now it's more about how fast or slow to go,
and how hard are the incumbents going to fight to hold the status quo."

The incumbents are currently fighting hard. The global fossil fuel
industry has sent more than [2,400 lobbyists to COP28, marking a rate of
increase that outpaces the rising attendance of lobbyists and business
groups at the conference as a whole.]{.underline}

At COP28, "Republicans are going to be talking more about how [fossil
fuels are not a transition field that should be phased
out]{.underline}," Heather Reams, president of Citizens for Responsible
Energy Solutions and co-chair of the Conservative Climate Foundation's
(CCF) board of directors. The CCF is convening Republican delegates at
COP28.

Like Woods, Reams argued [renewable technology was not yet prepared to
support the grid and that overreliance on it risked leaving the U.S. "in
the dark," as well as that the "clean **[fossil fuels" represented a key
element]{.mark}** of the future **[of U.S. energy
production]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Such a vision has substantial political and financial obstacles. The
Biden administration estimates that capturing meaningful levels of the
nation's carbon dioxide will require 96,000 miles of new pipelines --- a
proposal that is politically contentious among U.S. farmers.

And [installing technologies to capture greenhouse gasses on fossil fuel
power plants would further [raise prices for **a sector already
struggling to compete with renewables**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as Gregory
Nemet, a professor at the University of Wisconsin who studies the public
policy of technology change, told The Hill.

As Reuters noted, **[[68 gas plants were canceled or put on hold]{.mark}
in the first half of 2023 --- [thanks to a boom in new]{.mark}
large-scale [battery]{.mark} storage [plants]{.mark}]{.underline}**

"[It's just kind of incomprehensible that you would add 50 or 100
percent, to **the cost of a fossil power plant that's already more
expensive than building renewables**]{.underline} --- even if you have
to buy batteries too," Nemet said.

Investment in carbon capture technology reflects this financial reality.
According to the IEA, the fossil fuel industry has invested less than
0.1 percent of the funds in such technology that would be needed to
meaningfully capture their waste streams. By comparison, the IEA has
estimated that renewables investment needs to roughly triple by 2030 to
meet global climate goals.

[**[The declining financials of gas plants are a problem]{.mark}** in
one sense:]{.underline} They are still the only widespread form of
"dispatchable" power, or that --- like a backup generator in a home ---
which can produce power on demand.

That is a concern as rising electrification --- driven by the embrace of
heat pumps and electric vehicles (EVs) and the surging power demands of
the push toward artificial intelligence --- begins driving up U.S.
electrical demand for the first time in decades.

Much of that demand can be met by new technologies that allow homes ---
and even individual devices and chargers --- to "talk" to the grid,
avoiding rolling blackouts.

[In the current grid, **the production** of electricity **has to exactly
match its consumption** to avoid **dangerous spikes in power** ---
particularly because there historically was no way to store electricity
when it is plentiful and no way to reduce demand when it is
not.]{.underline}

But new smart-grid technology allows homes and devices to communicate
their specific electric demands to the collective grid --- which in turn
enables managers to reduce that demand by, say, turning smart
thermostats in a given area down by a degree, or postponing EV charging
until demand levels fall.

Such technologies also open the possibility for "virtual power plants"
that buy back power from EVs and home-scale battery storage.

But they aren't yet sufficient to close the gap between rising
electricity demand and current renewable levels, said Arshad Mansoor,
CEO of the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), a public interest
research and development firm.

[The oil]{.underline} and gas [industry]{.underline}, which supplies
around half of the world's fossil fuel consumption, [is highly
susceptible to]{.underline} both [risks]{.underline} and opportunities
[arising from the energy transition.]{.underline}

[Global oil consumption declined by 7% over the period
2019-20205]{.underline}, coal consumption fell by 4,4%, and natural gas
consumption decreased by 2,8%. Experts predict that oil consumption will
drop to 14 million barrels per day by 2050^6^ from the current level of
102.43 million barrels per day^7^. Oil consumption has been increasing
in recent years: in 2019, global oil consumption was 97.96 million
barrels per day, and in 2025 oil consumption is forecast to reach 103.81
million barrels per day. However, [the share of oil in the global energy
consumption mix has decreased significantly]{.underline}. According to
SPGlobal, in 2023 the share of oil was 33%, peaking at 50% in 1973^8^.

This suggests that [the share of RES in the global energy consumption
structure is increasing]{.underline}. By 2023 wind and solar energy
accounted for 13,2%^9^ of global energy consumption, while fossil fuel
usage continues to decline in percentage terms (though it may still grow
in absolute values). In Kazakhstan, the share of RES in the energy mix
in 2023 was 5,97%^10^, electricity generation by RES facilities in 2023
total of 6,675,5 million kWh. The installed capacity of RES facilities
in 2024 is 2,903.54 MW^11^ and in 2014 was only 178 MW, i.e. over 10
years of growth of RES facilities in Kazakhstan the share of RES
facilities has increased more than 16 times.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA)^12^, in 2022 the
world consumed about 97 million barrels of oil per day and 4,150 billion
cubic meters of natural gas. This led in GHG emissions of just over 18
Gt, representing roughly half of the total GHG emissions from the energy
sector. The recent development of clean energy technologies suggests
that oil and gas demand will peak by 2030 under the Sustainable Policy
(STEPS) scenario, after which a gradual decline is projected.

The transition to [net zero requires a significant acceleration in the
deployment of clean energy technologies and a more rapid reduction in
the use of oil]{.underline} and gas.

The IEA\'s Net Zero by 2050 report^13^ [in the scenario of achieving
carbon neutrality by 2050]{.underline}: The energy mix in 2050 is more
diverse than today. [Renewable energy sources provide two-thirds of
energy consumption]{.underline} in 2050, split between bioenergy, wind,
solar, hydroelectric and geothermal. In addition, nuclear energy supply
will increase significantly, almost doubling between 2020 and 2050.

Total energy supply in the Net Zero Emissions scenario according to IEA,

\[Figure 1 Omitted\]

[The share of fossil fuels in the total energy mix will fall from 80% in
2020 to just over 20%]{.underline} in 2050. However, their use will not
fall to zero in 2050: significant amounts are still used to produce
non-energy goods, carbon capture and utilization storage (CCUS -- Carbon
capture and utilization storage) technologies will be used and in
sectors where emissions are particularly difficult to reduce, such as
heavy industry and transport. All remaining emissions in 2050 are offset
by carbon capture and utilization technologies and climate projects
(e.g., carbon sequestration in forest ecosystems). Coal use will fall
from 5,250 million tons of coal equivalent in 2020 to 2,500 million tons
of coal equivalent in 2030 and to less than 600 million tons in
2050 -- an average annual decline estimated at 7% per year. [Oil demand
will fall to 72 million barrels per day in 2030 and 24 million barrels
per day in 2050]{.underline} - an average annual decline of more than 4%
through 2050. Natural gas use peaks in the mid-2020s and then begins to
decline as it is phased out in the power sector. Natural gas use
declines to 3,700 billion m3 in 2030 and 1,750 billion m3 in 2050 - an
average annual decline of just under 3% per year.

#### OBBB means renewables aren't inevitable

Mackenzie, 7-11-2025; accessed 7-14-2025
https://www.woodmac.com/blogs/energy-pulse/big-beautiful-bill-us-energy/\]

Securing control of the US Presidency, Senate and House of
Representatives in last year's elections put the Republicans in a strong
position to implement their policy agenda, and this year they have taken
full advantage of that. The legislation informally known as the "one big
beautiful bill", signed into law by President Donald Trump last week on
4 July, advanced Republican priorities in a wide range of areas,
including taxes, Medicaid, food stamps and immigration enforcement.

Energy is one of the industries that will be most affected by the
legislation. [Tax credits for low-carbon energy are being phased
out]{.underline} faster, restricted in availability [or]{.underline}
simply [abolished]{.underline}. The total value of [the
credits]{.underline} to the industry [will be]{.underline} about
[US\$500 billion lower over the next 10 years]{.underline}, according to
the Tax Foundation.

[Wind and solar power are hit particularly hard]{.underline} by the
changes. To claim the full value of the old technology-neutral tax
credits, known as 45Y and 48E, wind and solar projects must be placed in
service by the end of 2027, or start construction by 4 July 2026 and
enter service by the end of 2030.

The White House this week issued an executive order aimed at restricting
those credits still further. The Treasury secretary will issue revised
guidance on the meaning of "start construction" under the law, with the
aim of ruling projects eligible only if "a substantial portion of
a subject facility has been built".

[Wind and solar projects also face strict new requirements on the
involvement of foreign entities]{.underline} of concern (FEOCs). The
rules limit the availability of tax credits based on the involvement of
companies and individuals from four countries: China, Russia, Iran and
North Korea. The effect is to penalise reliance on equipment from
prohibited foreign entities, such as Chinese-backed manufacturers.

The law specifies that the new rules should apply to projects that begin
construction after the end of this year. But President [Trump's
executive order calls]{.underline} on the Treasury to take [prompt
action]{.underline} to implement the restrictions [within 45
days.]{.underline}

Other low-carbon energy technologies, including battery storage,
geothermal and nuclear, fare better under the new law. Those
dispatchable clean sources retain full tax credit eligibility for
construction beginning up to the end of 2033, 75% in 2034, 50% in 2035
and then 0% thereafter.

However, the **[FEOC rules]{.underline}** also apply here. They [will be
a significant problem for storage projects, given China's dominance of
the battery supply chain.]{.underline}

Nuclear power was threatened by steep cuts in tax credits during
negotiations over the bill, despite bipartisan support for the industry.
But in the final legislation, the primary incentives for nuclear power
that were established under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) were
retained. The one significant change to the 45U tax credit for existing
nuclear plants is the addition of FEOC restrictions. The credit for new
advanced nuclear technologies, such as small modular reactors, remains
in place, phasing out after 2032.

Hydrogen is another technology facing reduced tax credits. Section 45V,
the clean hydrogen production tax credit introduced in the IRA, will be
available only for projects that begin construction before the end of
2027. It was previously set to be available up to the end of 2032.

Carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) is one sector that
actually benefits under the new law. The 45Q tax credit for CCUS has
been retained, and its value increased for capture with utilisation or
enhanced oil recovery (EOR). The IRA had set a lower value credit for
carbon captured for utilisation or enhanced oil recovery than for
geological sequestration, but the new law has raised it to the same
level.

[The oil and gas industry]{.underline} also [benefits from the
legislation]{.underline}. The IRA raised royalty rates for production
leases on federal lands, and that increase has been reversed, taking the
minimum rate back down to 12.5% from 16.67%. The new law also mandates
an increased pace of lease sales for federal waters offshore, in Alaska,
and in eight other states onshore.

#### Increase in oil supply while having [static]{.underline} demand drives prices down [significantly]{.underline}.

**Henderson 20** \[David R. Henderson; research fellow with the Hoover

Postgraduate School in Monterey, California; 3-11-2020; The Drop In Oil
Prices: Good Or Bad?; Hoover Institution;

Accessed 7-14-2025\] HS 宋

[When economists say that demand decreases, we mean something very
specific]{.underline}---[that at any given price, the amount demanded
decreases]{.underline}. [There are two main ways]{.underline} that can
happen: a slowing of the world economy [or an increase in the
supply]{.underline} of a substitute.

If the world economy slows---and it certainly looks as if it has slowed,
or will, due to the COVID-19 virus and people's reaction to it---the
demand for oil will fall. With a given supply, that will cause the price
of oil to fall. The fall in the price of oil is not bad per se; rather,
it's a consequence of something bad, namely, the slowing of the world
economy. And it certainly appears that a fall in demand due to a slowing
economy caused prices to fall before last weekend. But it's unlikely
that there was a sudden fall in demand last weekend. We have to look
elsewhere.

[The other possible cause of a fall in the demand for oil is an increase
in the supply of a substitute for oil. If, for example, solar or nuclear
energy became more competitive, the demand for oil would fall. In that
case, the fall in oil's price would be a sign of something good
happening in the economy]{.underline}. Did solar, nuclear, or any other
energy source suddenly become more competitive over this weekend? No. So
that's not it.

[How about an increase in supply? If supply increases, then, with a
given demand, prices will fall.]{.underline} Notice that I\'m using the
word \"[supply\" to mean not the quantity supplied, but the whole supply
curve]{.underline}. [When an economist says that supply increased, he
means that at any given price, the quantity supplied has
increased.]{.underline} The whole supply curve has shifted to the right.
This sounds wonky and may remind you of an old economics class in which
the professor insisted on the distinction between a shift in supply and
a movement along a stable supply curve. But here we need a little
wonkiness to help us analyze.

But there were no major discoveries of oil or breakthroughs in
technology over the weekend that would cause the supply to increase. So
that's not what drove prices down.

troops from Saudi Arabia. [It was also made very clear by Trump that the
next time the Saudis tried the same thing it would be the end of the
1945 Agreement between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia that had laid the
foundation for their cooperation since that point, as also detailed in
full my latest book on the new global oil market order]{.underline}.
This, said Trump, would involve the immediate withdrawal of all U.S.
military assistance from the Kingdom, without further notice. Following
that, Saudi Arabia and OPEC gradually cut oil production to bring prices
back up. Nothing in Trump's fundamental view of Saudi Arabia has changed
in his second term as president, according to the same senior legal
source. [This is why, despite having a US\$90.9 per barrel (pb) of Brent
crude fiscal breakeven price this year, Saudi Arabia is under no
illusions what will happen to it if it attempts to disturb Trump's
fiercely guarded oil price range. And this leaves Aramco having to
scrabble around trying to fill the resultant gaping black holes in its
finances and that of Saudi Arabia.]{.underline}

The 'Trump Oil Price Range' is as vital a part of the president's
financial strategy now as it was back when he first took on the job and
comprises not just the aggressively-protected floor but an equally
staunchly-defended ceiling too[. The floor of the range is designed to
give a good profit to most U.S. shale producers over and above the
US\$35 pb of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) point at which
well-established sites can breakeven (so, historically around US\$40 pb
of Brent, based on the longstanding premium there).]{.underline} That
was one part of the range that Trump sought to defend in his telephone
call to the Saudi Crown Prince in April 2020. On the other side of the
range, the ceiling kicks is positioned at around US\$70 pb of WTI (about
US\$75 pb of Brent, given the historical premium). This ties into data
showing that a gasoline price of under US\$2 per gallon has been most
advantageous for U.S. economic growth. This US\$2 per gallon level has
historically equated to the US\$70 pb of WTI price. [One reason why this
is so important is the close correlation between oil prices and the
wider health of the U.S. economy. Historical data highlights that every
US\$10 pb or so change in the price of crude oil results in around a
25-30 cent change in the price of a gallon of gasoline, and for every 1
cent that the average price per gallon of gasoline rises, more than
US\$1 billion or so per year in consumer spending is lost.]{.underline}
The other important reason \-- political \-- is that since 1896, the
sitting U.S. president has won re-election 11 times out of 11 if the
economy was not in recession within two years of an upcoming election.
However, sitting U.S. presidents who went into a re-election campaign
with the economy in recession won only one time out of seven, as fully
analysed in my latest book on the new global oil market order.
Consequently, it is more than Trump's job is worth to allow the Saudis
to meaningfully push up oil prices, regardless of how much economic pain
the Kingdom is in.

Quite aside from the silver bullet option of the withdrawal of U.S.
military support from Saudi Arabia, Trump has several other options to
ensure that the Kingdom does what is asked of it when it comes to oil
prices. An especially effective and targeted option that is being kept
in the proverbial bottom drawer of the Oval Office is the 'No Oil
Producing and Exporting Cartels' (NOPEC) Bill. Trump has ordered this to
be made fully ready to be passed into law at minimal notice. The NOPEC
Bill would make it illegal to artificially cap oil production or to set
prices, as OPEC does under the leadership of the Saudi Arabia. [The Bill
would also immediately remove the sovereign immunity in U.S. courts for
OPEC as a group and for every one of its individual member states. This
would leave Saudi Arabia open to being sued under existing U.S.
anti-trust legislation, with its total liability being its estimated
US\$1 trillion of investments in the U.S. alone.]{.underline} The U.S.
would then be legally entitled to freeze all Saudi bank accounts in the
U.S., seize its assets in the country, and halt all use of U.S. dollars
by the Saudis anywhere in the world (oil is denominated in U.S. dollars,
of course). It would also allow the U.S. to go after Saudi Aramco and
its assets and funds, as it is still a majority state-owned production
and trading vehicle. This would mean that Aramco could be ordered to
break itself up into smaller, constituent companies that are not deemed
to break competition rules in the oil, gas, and petrochemicals sectors
or to influence the oil price. Yahtzee!

[This leaves Saudi Arabia and its chief money-making enterprise Aramco
in a bit of a pickle, which is precisely where Trump wants them. Whether
he cares if their hearts and minds will follow is open to debate, but
what is not is that he has -- to invert the Theodore Roosevelt quote --
got them by the balls. The Brent oil price is havering around US\$70 pb
now -- the 'Trump Oil Price Range' ceiling, but nearly 30% below Saudi
Arabia's minimum fiscal breakeven price.]{.underline} This already
prompted Aramco to drastically cut its quarterly dividend after
reporting a 5% year-on-year drop in profit for the first three months of
the year. The firm had already announced in March that it expected its
dividends for this full year to decline to \$85.4bn from \$124.3bn in
2024. For a company whose initial public offering relied so heavily on
the giant dividends being promised -- [given that it as regarded as
omni-toxic by so many Western investors -- this is a massive blow to its
market credibility and to its ability to raise finance. One obvious
route -- of which the U.S is well aware -- is to secure such money
through big bond offerings, but this will increase the already
burgeoning debt profile of the Kingdom. Aramco already sold US\$5
billion of bonds in May and signalled that it will want to borrow much
more. It will also increase the power of the bondholders to influence
decision at Aramco, with a large proportion of these likely to be
connected to the U.S., according to the Washington-based legal source.
The Saudis may also be aware of this, as the latest talk out of Riyadh
is that Aramco instead is looking to sell some of its key power assets
and pipelines instead]{.underline}. Although such income is supposedly
intended to go to 'Vision 2030' that is designed to reduce Saudi
Arabia\'s dependence on oil, some investors fear it will end up in one
of the many vanity projects that have characterised this 'Vision'. The
grandiose Neom City idea has already been drastically scaled down from
an intended length of 170 kilometres by 2030 to just 2.4 kilometres by
that point. However, the new pet project of Crown Prince Mohammed bin
Salman is the showpiece FIFA World Cup 2034 soccer event, so that
appears a more likely destination for any such funds. A fall-back
position for Aramco perhaps would be to ask Cristiano Ronaldo for a
loan, following the US\$677 million two-year extension with Saudi
Arabia's Al-Nassr soccer team he just signed.

#### Oil prices drop when demand decreases

Let's apply that lesson here. [There are three (and only three) [reasons
that oil prices drop: (1) demand decreases]{.mark}]{.underline}, (2)
supply increases, or (3) the monopoly power of oil producers falls.

When [economists say that demand decreases]{.underline}, we mean
something very specific---[that at any given price, the amount demanded
decreases.]{.underline} There are two main ways that can happen: a
slowing of the world economy or an increase in the supply of a
substitute.

If the world economy slows---and it certainly looks as if it has slowed,
or will, due to the COVID-19 virus and people's reaction to it---the
demand for oil will fall. With a given supply, that will cause the price
of oil to fall. The fall in the price of oil is not bad per se; rather,
it's a consequence of something bad, namely, the slowing of the world
economy. And it certainly appears that a fall in demand due to a slowing
economy caused prices to fall before last weekend. But it's unlikely
that there was a sudden fall in demand last weekend. We have to look
elsewhere.

The [other possible [cause of a fall in the demand for oil is an
increase in the supply of a substitute for oil]{.mark}. [If,]{.mark} for
example, [solar or nuclear energy became more competitive, the demand
for oil would fall]{.mark}]{.underline}. In that case, the fall in oil's
price would be a sign of something good happening in the economy. Did
solar, nuclear, or any other energy source suddenly become more
competitive over this weekend? No. So that's not it.

[The [world]{.mark} could [have]{.mark} a [**glut** of oil]{.mark} by
the end of the decade because of [rising production combined with
declining demand]{.mark}]{.underline} [as consumers]{.underline} and
businesses [switch to]{.underline} [electric]{.underline} vehicles [and
renewable]{.underline} energy, [according to a]{.underline} new [report
from the I]{.underline}nternational [E]{.underline}nergy
[A]{.underline}gency[.]{.underline}

The International Energy Agency said Wednesday that [the [world\'s total
oil supply]{.mark}]{.underline} [[capacity is expected to rise to about
114 million barrels a day by 2030]{.mark}, which the group said would
amount to \"staggering[\" 8 million barrels a day beyond projected
demand.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[That type of spare capacity hasn\'t been seen outside the
**COVID**-]{.underline}19 lockdowns of 2020, when economies across the
world shut down as governments sought to stop the spread of the deadly
virus, the IEA said[.]{.underline} [The extra capacity
could]{.underline} have \"**[significant consequences for oil
markets]{.underline}**,\" ranging from the U.S. to OPEC member nations
such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, it added.

\"This report\'s projections, based on the latest data, show a major
supply surplus emerging this decade, suggesting that oil companies may
want to make sure their business strategies and plans are prepared for
the changes taking place,\" said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol in a
statement.

Among the drivers for rising oil supplies are expectations that
Americans and consumers in other developed nations will continue to
shift to electric vehicles. Global sales of EVs could reach 40 million
cars in 2030, with almost one in two new cars projected to be an EV at
that time, the IEA forecasted.

Could gas prices decline?

It\'s possible that [an [oversupply]{.mark} of oil could [lead to a
\"**lower price environment**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline}\" according to
the IEA report. However, [the analysis includes]{.underline} three
[projections]{.underline} for [where oil]{.underline} prices [could
be]{.underline} in 2030, ranging from a high of more than \$90 a barrel
to a low of [**less than \$60 a barrel within six years**.]{.underline}
Currently, oil is trading at about \$82 a barrel.

[[Oil prices have **roared back**]{.underline}]{.mark} to about where
they were in the early days of the Ukraine war, [[and there's no
prospect of significant relief]{.underline}]{.mark} for drivers and
businesses [any time soon. The price of Brent crude]{.underline}, the
global benchmark[, shot up]{.underline} past \$124 a barrel earlier this
week --- its highest level since early March [--- after the European
Union announced it would]{.underline} [slash 90% of its Russian oil
imports](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/05/30/energy/eu-russian-oil/index.html)
by the end of this year. Prices have since fallen back slightly to
around \$117, largely because of expectations that OPEC will pump more
oil, but not enough to ease the pain felt by consumers at the pump, or
to tame rampant global
[inflation](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/01/09/economy/what-is-inflation-and-whos-to-blame/index.html).
The EU embargo and a recovery in demand in the world's second biggest
economy will keep them high. Matt Smith, lead oil analyst for the
Americas at Kpler, an analytics company, told CNN Business that
"[[triple digit oil prices" are likely to stick
around]{.mark}.]{.underline} "If Chinese demand comes roaring back after
lockdowns and Russia continues to see production drop, then a retest of
the high of \$139 seen earlier in the year is not beyond the realms of
possibility," he said. Europe ditches Russia's oil Even as [soaring

**unlikely to fall** enough to dent prices, as it did in
2008]{.mark}.]{.underline} "The worry this time around is --- because it
is a supply side issue --- that even if we were to head into a recession
... we may not necessarily see prices come off at the pump
substantially," Smith said. The European Union on Friday formally
adopted its oil embargo, part of a sixth package of sanctions imposed on
Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. Most EU countries now have six
months to phase out imports of Russian crude, and eight months for all
other oil products. For now, Smith said, the bloc will likely continue
to buy some oil from Russia, but it has been shopping around for
alternate suppliers. According to Kpler data, imports of crude from
Angola have tripled since the start of the war, while Brazilian and
Iraqi volumes have risen by 50% and 40% respectively. [[Sourcing oil
from more far-flung locations will keep prices
high]{.underline}]{.mark}, Roslan Khasawneh, senior fuel oil analyst at
Vortexa, an energy data firm, told CNN Business. "A direct impact of
this is the higher freight cost due to the longer-haul voyages, and in
turn, delivered costs of the oil," he said. [Governments can do a few
things to ease prices]{.underline}, including offer fuel subsidies and
capping prices at the pump. [But [the silver bullet the world really
needs to bring down prices --- a lot more supply --- is hard to come

[The **third-largest decline in oil prices in modern his- tory occurred
between mid-2014 and early 2016.** The cost decreased by 70% over that
period. The initial **decline in oil prices was caused by supply
reasons** such as increased U.S. oil output, diminished geo- political
tensions, and revised OPEC policy]{.underline} (Bataa & Park, 2017). In
June 2014, the price of crude oil decreased by over a third as tight oil
(shale oil) pro- duction in the United States soared and demand for oil
in China and Europe dropped. [In Vienna, **Saudi Oil Minister Ali
al-Naimi vetoed output cuts from less wealthy OPEC members including
Venezuela, Iran, and Algeria, which put pressure on American companies
to cut production** despite a vast world- wide oversupply as discussed
in a report published by CNBC in Nov 2014. Oil prices continued to fall,
and WTI plunged to \$58 at the end of December 2014. The price of oil
further dropped to \$50 per barrel in 2015 because of rising shale oil
production which was profitable at this price. On January 12, 2016,
**WTI crude prices dipped under \$30 per barrel** for the first time
since 2003, setting a record low of eleven years. The price of crude oil
in the US fell to \$26, its lowest level since May 2003.]{.underline}
Between 2014 and 2016, OPEC policy changes and sluggish economic growth
around the globe resulted in a fall in oil prices to a 13-year lower
level. This fall in oil prices crashed the Venezuelan Bolivares exchange
rate to US Dol- lar to 9.9 (Duan et al., 2021). However, develop- ing
Asian economies like India benefitted from the decreased price. At its
meeting on September 26, 2016, [OPEC decided to reduce production.
Although the U.S. agreed to reduce production, it did not go so further
out of concern for losing market share. As a result of this action,
prices kept dropping. The dol- lar was weak, OPEC country's production
was down, and U.S. production and inventories were up. All this
prevented oil prices from rising as much as they would
have.]{.underline} On January 26, 2017, WTI touched \$53 and Brent crude
\$55 (Behar & Ritz, 2016; McNally, 2017; Liu et al., 2019; Quint &

\*FFRDCs = fossil fuel rich developing countries

THE WORLD'S CARBON BUDGET AND STRANDED RESERVES Fossil fuels may be
plentiful from a geological point of view, but if the world burns all
available fossil fuels the impact on the climate will be severe.
Emerging research suggests that the world should aim to restrict the
accumulated carbon and other greenhouse gases emitted between 2011 and
2050 to 1,100 Gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (McGlade and
Ekins, 2014; Allen et al. 2009; Allen et al. 2015, Meinhausen et al.
2009). This limit is referred to as the world's 'carbon budget'.
Breaking this budget significantly risks deteriorating global
environmental and social conditions and 'runaway' climate change---in
which natural positive feedback loops contribute to ever greater climate
change effects. In comparison, the estimated combustible carbon dioxide
content of the world's reserves3 of oil, gas, and coal in 2014 was 2,900
gigatonnes (McGlade and Ekins 2014). Therefore, to avoid using up the
world's carbon budget and causing extreme climate change, two thirds of
existing fossil fuel reserves must remain undeveloped. Keeping two
thirds of reserves in the ground necessitates a significant reduction in
the world's use of fossil fuels. This, in turn, necessitates a long-term
decline in the demand for fossil fuels, which could occur if governments
impose carbon taxes or similar policies4 ; if there is a broad
transition to alternative energy supplies, such as nuclear or
renewables; or if economic activity becomes significantly more efficient
in using energy. Reserves may also remain undeveloped if governments
impose policies to limit the market supply of fossil fuel resources. 5
**[[A fall in]{.mark} fossil fuel [demand]{.mark}]{.underline}**, other
things equal, **[[will lead to a fall in]{.mark} fossil fuel
[prices]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This might lead to existing reserves
remaining undeveloped or 'stranded'. Meanwhile projects that remain
commercially viable will be less valuable. [[This]{.mark} in turn [may
diminish]{.mark} the rents and therefore tax [revenues]{.mark} fossil
fuel extraction can generate [for producing
countries]{.mark}.]{.underline} To understand this, consider an example
from the global oil market. The price received for a barrel of oil is
roughly the same for all projects after accounting for relatively small
differences in the quality of oil (such as viscosity) and transport
costs. However, costs will differ considerably across location and
geology. Figure 2 shows a representative global supply curve that ranks
all oil projects from least to most expensive in terms of unit costs of
production. For any given market price, lower cost projects, on the left
part of the supply curve, will have a higher asset value per barrel than
high cost projects. [If the producer price falls, say in response to a
climate policy, some projects with costs higher than the prevailing
price will become stranded, while some value of all remaining operating
projects will be foregone]{.underline}. Asset stranding and significant
falls in values in the fossil fuel industry are not new, the recent
commodity price slump has stranded many projects already and fossil fuel
companies have seen the value of their assets reduced by many millions
of dollars. However, [the scale of such an outcome under]{.underline},
for example, [an]{.underline} effective [[global climate policy]{.mark}
would be entirely new]{.underline}. **[It [would]{.mark} also [imply a
permanence not normally considered during commodity price
slumps]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For example, figure 3 shows estimates of
the proportion of reserves already discovered that could become
permanently stranded if the world keeps to its carbon budget. THE
LIKELIHOOD OF CARBON MARKET RISK Whether governments can implement
effective climate policies to reduce global fossil fuel consumption or
whether alternative energy sources gain sufficient market share is
highly uncertain. This paper does not directly address this uncertainty
but assumes that the probability is greater than zero. Further, even if
the probability is low, the impact on fossil-fuel rich countries may be
very large for the reasons discussed. This has some corollary to the
so-called 'fat-tailed risk' or the 'precautionary principle' of climate
damages---where the probability of an impact is low, but the impact
itself is high, necessitating precautionary actions (Weitzman 2011).
Given these conditions fossil-fuel rich countries should carefully
consider how their policy choices might be modified by carbon market
risk and what type of, and how urgent, such precautionary actions should
be. We will address these policies in the final part of this paper. The
likelihood of a permanent fall in fossil fuel demand, or 'carbon market
risk' rest on four factors. First, governments of carbon emitting
countries could impose policies that keep emissions within the global
carbon budget. This could take the form of demand-side policies, such as
consumer taxes, or supply-side measures such as producer taxes or
quantity restrictions, or some mix of these policies. The Paris COP21
made some advance towards countries imposing climate policies but it is
unclear how the result of these negotiations will influence policy.
Second, the market share of renewables, nuclear and other alternatives
to fossil fuels could increase substantially. Solar and wind power
capacity has increased exponentially during the last decade, although
starting from a small base in comparison to fossil fuel-derived energy.
Currently 13 percent of global primary energy supply is from renewables.
Projected shares of renewable energy to total energy in 2030 in this
share range from 14 percent---by Exxon---to 43 percent---by Geotechnical
and Environment Associates (Meister Consultants Group 2015). The
International Energy Agency, an often quoted authority on the subject,
forecasts that renewables will still account for only 15 percent of
global energy supply by 2040 (IEA 2015). However, the IEA has
consistently underestimated renewables growth in the past, and so can be
considered relatively pessimistic (Metayer et al. 2015). Third, energy
efficiency measures could improve to reduce future energy demand. There
are signs that this will happen. The world economy is gradually
'decarbonising'---greenhouse gas emissions per dollar of GDP are
falling. From 2000 to 2014, the carbon intensity of economic activity
has fallen by 1.3 percent each year on average, although total
greenhouse gas emissions are still rising as the global economy grew 3.7
percent a year on average over the same period (PWC 2015). This
decarbonisation trend is set to continue. The carbon intensity of the
Chinese economy, already the largest greenhouse gas emitter in the
world, fell by two percent in this period, and 6.7 percent in 2013 to
2014. In addition, Green and Stern (2015) forecast that Chinese carbon
emissions will peak by 2025. A fourth factor is the success or failure
of carbon capture and storage (CCS) methods---including both initiatives
to expand 'carbon sinks' such as forests, and technologies that directly
prevent carbon emission from entering the atmosphere. If these develop,
there is less need to restrict fossil fuel production for climate change
purposes: the carbon and other greenhouse gases can be removed from the
atmosphere and stored. However, CCS faces three problems: first, aside
from forests, man-made CCS methods are not currently commercially
viable; second, retrofitting CCS technologies to transport, power
stations and other carbon emitters appears prohibitively expensive; and
third, there is currently few viable methods to safely store carbon
without sufficiently reducing the risks of carbon leaking into the
atmosphere after being 'captured (Helm 2015). FROM STRANDED ASSETS TO
STRANDED NATIONS: THREE CHALLENGES The risk of stranded assets for
fossil fuel investors is receiving increasing attention and concern from
researchers and analysts, in particular the work by Carbon Tracker (see
Leaton 2013). If stranded assets are a concern for investors, we argue
they should be an even bigger concern for many fossil fuel-rich
developing countries. We focus on fossil fuel-rich developing countries
(FFRDCs), which we define as those countries: 1) whose value of known
fossil fuel reserves is at least 25 percent of their total wealth
(Produced, Intangible, Foreign and Natural assets)6 OR the value of
fossil fuel production is at least 10 percent of GDP; AND 2) whose GNI
per capita is less than USD 12,736 (Middle, Low middle or Low income
country definition according to World Bank classification). Figure 4
maps these FFRDCs; the appendix describes how we calculated fossil fuel
values. For these FFRDCs, the realisation of carbon market risk---the
widespread adoption of carbon policies, rise in alternative energy use
or the decarbonisation of the world economy---resulting in a permanent
fall in the producer price of fossil fuels presents three challenges.
CHALLENGE 1: FFRDCS ARE HIGHLY EXPOSED TO CARBON MARKET RISK According
to one estimate, of the USD 25 trillion of fossil fuel value at risk,
fossil fuel-rich governments face 80 percent of the risk (Nelson 2014).
[[A fall in]{.mark} fossil fuel [prices for producers **significantly**
reduces the rents available]{.mark} from fossil fuel extraction on
existing investments, and makes further development of reserves less
profitable, potentially [stranding]{.mark} much of their fossil fuel
reserves and related **[assets]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This reduces
government revenues collected from fossil fuel extraction and non-fiscal
benefits to the domestic economy. A decline in government revenues in
particular restricts the ability of governments to support economic
development---although strong public financial management practices can
help governments, in the short term, to shield their budgets to abrupt
changes to government revenues. Fossil fuel-rich developing countries
(FFRDCs) currently hold a significantly proportion of their national
wealth in the form of fossil fuel reserves and related assets (figure 5)
and their fossil fuel wealth is more at risk of a permanent decline in
prices than non-FFRDCs (figure 7). The possibility of a permanent fall
in fossil fuel use exposes these countries to the risk of losing this
portion of national wealth.7 Figure 5 shows that FFRDCs ranked according
to the value of fossil fuel reserves to GDP. Their median ratio of
fossil fuel reserves to GDP is 3.66, compared with a median for
non-FFRCs of 0.58. Note that prospective countries that are potentially
rich in fossil fuels but with few developed projects and currently low
production rates---Tanzania, Uganda, Guatemala, among others---do not
fall within our definition of 'fossil fuel-rich developing countries'.
However, the analysis and policy implications in this paper are highly
relevant for these countries as they create policies that will govern
their sectors over the next few decades. Important factors in valuing
FFRDCs' reserves are the assumptions on fossil fuel prices, costs and
the social discount rate. We have chosen to use prices realised in 2015
which are low by historical standards, and so produce a relatively
optimistic -for FFRDCs- estimate of the value at risk. We analyse the
value of production from reserves, rather than rent, so ignore costs of
exploration, development and production. In addition, we have chosen a
social discount rate of four percent, as used by the World Bank to
estimate wealth values in World Bank (2011). Figure 7 shows the effect
of a simulated decline in prices for the whole set of fossil fuel-rich
developing countries, comparing the value of reserves given constant
prices and the value of reserves given a steady decline in prices of two
percent year-on-year. This price decline is assumed purely to illustrate
the effect of a declining price path. In practice, the price decline may
be higher or lower than this, and is unlikely to be a smooth decline.8
The assumption of a smooth decline in prices abstracts away from the
likely path of prices. The combination of climate change policies and
the rising market share of alternative energy sources may result in an
abrupt and permanent fall in prices at some point in the future. For
further discussion of our modelling of a price decline, please refer to
the Appendix. The value-at-risk column in figure 7 shows the difference
in the value of reserves assuming current prices are maintained, and the
value of reserves assuming a year-on-year decline of two percent. The
difference is largely determined by the rate at which countries can
deplete their reserves, which we assume to be equal to the current
production rate in each country. Countries with lower
reserveto-production ratios are likely able to extract their resources
faster than those with high reserve-toproduction ratios and avoid more
of the effect of a fall in future values. Venezuela, for example, has
large reserves and low production rates, so could see a fifth of the
value of its reserves cut under the assumed fall in prices. CHALLENGE 2:
FFRDCS COULD BE LESS ABLE TO DIVERSIFY THEIR CARBON MARKET RISK Not only
are FFRDCs exposed to a possible permanent fall in fossil fuel use,
but---compared with fossil fuel companies---FFRDCs are less able to
diversify their exposure (Mitchell et al. 2015). This suggests that the
arguments made of the dangers of stranded assets for fossil fuel
companies are even more relevant for fossil fuel-rich developing
countries. The ability to diversify or reduce their exposure to carbon
market risk depends on two factors. First, the time and cost of
converting their fossil fuel related assets into other non-related
assets, such as cash---known in the financial sense as the asset's
liquidity. Second, the ability to hold a diversified portfolio of
assets. In terms of market liquidity, companies can relatively easily
divest from fossil fuel related assets into assets less exposed to
carbon market risk. While it is likely that as more companies seek to
divest liquidity will fall, but with sufficient time, an orderly
transition can occur. Companies own the extraction rights to relatively
few booked reserves, with relatively high production rates. For example,
in 2013, the reserve-to-production ratios for all oil and gas companies
were 12.8 years and 13.9 years respectively (EY 2013). Therefore,
companies can, in principle, stop replacing their reserves and run down
their existing reserves over the next 13 to 14 years. Although, given
that most oil companies currently seek to maintain or increase their
reserves, this is unlikely to happen immediately. In comparison to
companies, FFRDCs hold fossil fuel assets that are less financially
liquid. For FFRDCs, fossil fuel assets can typically only be converted
at the rate based on the time taken to develop and produce from an
extraction project. Using past reserve-to-production ratios as an
indicator of the speed at which countries can convert their subsoil
assets into cash, figure 8 shows that most countries must wait many
decades (a median of 45 years) to liquidate their fossil fuel wealth,
unless they can find ways to increase their rates of production. For
those countries that enter development agreements with private sector
companies, the depletion of reserves will be equal between countries and
companies---the same reserve is being depleted. What accounts for
difference in reserve-to-production ratios is the national ownership and
production of reserves led by state-owned enterprises in many FFRDCs.
For instance, 18 of the 23 countries in figure 8 have national oil
companies. 9 In addition to being able to liquidate their fossil fuel
assets quicker than FFRDCs, companies also own or manage a more
diversified portfolio of fossil fuel assets, for example across a
variety of different countries and with different cost profiles; in
contrast to countries whose fossil fuel reserves are geographically
bound. Further, [[few resource rich countries have]{.mark} successfully
[diversified]{.mark} their economies and holding foreign assets has been
limited by the rate of depletion and ability to hold revenues as
savings]{.underline} (Venables 2016). Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs), in
which funds are invested in foreign assets, are one way for a government
to hold a wider range of non-fossil fuel linked assets. However, making
funds available for this purpose can be difficult given government
expenditure needs within the country, and can increase the risk of
inappropriate use of these funds (Bauer 2014). Further, the assets of
sovereign wealth funds owned by FFRDC governments represent only three
percent of their fossil fuel reserves on average (see figure 9).
CHALLENGE 3: FFRDCS MAY PURSUE POLICIES THAT INCREASE EXPOSURE TO CARBON
MARKET RISK [In addition to being exposed and limited in their ability
to diversify from carbon market risk, some of the economic policies
common to fossil fuel-rich countries may increase FFRDCs'
exposure]{.underline}. First, National Oil Companies ([NOCs), common in
oil-rich countries, involve the investment of state capital into fossil
fuel assets]{.underline}. If the expected life of these assets is long
enough that declining oil, gas or coal prices will impact returns, or a
government cannot liquidate these assets at a reasonable value, then
governments, by investing in an NOC, may be increasing the exposure of
national wealth and public assets to carbon market risk. This exposure
increases for NOCs that operate reserves abroad in the same manner as
other oil companies are exposed to carbon market risk (see above).
Figure 10 shows the significant values of state ownership in NOCs in
FFRDCs \[[[fossil fuel rich developing countries]{.underline}]{.mark}\]
(for which there is data). Second, some governments seek to capture
value by encouraging the domestic private sector to participate in oil,
gas, and coal supply chains, often known as promoting 'local content'.
This aims to increase the share of the proceeds from extraction retained
by the domestic economy. In addition, some local content policies aim to
develop skills of local workers and advance business practices that
spread to other sectors in the economy not directly related to
extraction. However, whatever the objectives, such policies to promote
local content may increase a country's exposure to the carbon market
risk by increasing the total share of a country's assets (either
foregone public revenues, or a share of the nation's human or physical
capital) that would be exposed to a fall in fossil fuel demand. If the
public, physical and human capital investment in local content delivers
high returns---both in the financial and social sense---in the earlier
rather than later years, or if the skills and business developed to
supply fossil industries can be applied to other sectors, the carbon
market risk is reduced. However, if local content takes many years to
develop, foregoes significant tax revenues, or has limited value outside
the fossil fuel sector, these policies may increase countries' exposure.
Third, fossil fuel rich countries have tended to develop economies that
are relatively carbonintensive. Figure 11 shows that petroleum and coal
producers (highlighted in red and blue respectively) emit a larger
amount of carbon per dollar of GDP than non-fossil fuel producers). A
chief policy that has led to this carbon intensive development is the
tendency for fossil fuel producers to subsidise fuel consumption
(Friedrichs and Inderwildi 2013). This is a concern for countries
wishing to reduce global carbon emissions, but also a concern for fossil
fuel-rich countries seeking to reduce exposure to the carbon market
risk. [These countries could [suffer]{.mark} in two ways. First, if
their trading partners]{.underline} (such as the European Union) [impose
a carbon consumption tax]{.underline}: a policy in which the consumers
of products are taxed according to the carbon content of the product,
rather than a tax imposed on carbon emitters (Helm 2015). [Second, they
would suffer [if]{.mark} climate [finance]{.mark} [initiatives]{.mark}
reward those countries that do [reduce fossil fuel consumption]{.mark}
or emissions.]{.underline}

[[Stranded asset **risk**]{.mark} is [relevant for]{.mark} the [energy
sector]{.mark}]{.underline} and beyond. Most [**[fossil energy]{.mark}**
assets are long-lived;]{.underline} they usually [require a large
initial investment]{.underline}, but have relatively [low operating
costs]{.underline}. Davis and Socolow (2014) show that expected future
cumulative emissions from the existing infrastructure of the global
power sector have increased dramatically in the last decades. Such
[[**long-term** investments]{.mark} have the potential [to **"lock in**"
carbon-intensive **tec**]{.mark}**h**nologies for a long]{.underline}
period of [time]{.underline} (Erickson et al., 2015).42 [Calculations by
**IEA**]{.underline} (2013) and Pfeiffer et al. (2016) conclude that the
"2° capital stock" will already be reached in 2017. Investments in
fossil capacities after 2017 are inefficient: they lead to "both larger
carbon lock-ins and higher short-term emissions that need to be
compensated by deeper emissions cuts in the long run" (IPCC, 2014),
increasing the cost of climate change mitigation. Moreover, in order to
achieve emission cuts in such a scenario, fossil assets need to be
stranded. IEA (2013) provides a conservative estimate that the energy
industry faces sunk costs of \$ 120 billion due to fossil fuel plants
being retired early, even if action to achieve the 2°C goal had started
in 2012. For a scenario of delaying climate action until 2030 (and using
a different methodology), IRENA (2017a) estimates stranded assets of \$
1.9 trillion in electricity generation, and an additional \$ 7 trillion
in upstream energy infrastructure (mostly oil production). This is
approximately equivalent to 3.5% of global income, and implies a risk
not just for [the [obviously affected **energy industry**]{.mark} facing
[sunk costs:]{.mark}]{.underline} international organizations,
[financial [institutions]{.mark}]{.underline} and regulators
[[are]{.mark} increasingly [concerned about]{.mark}]{.underline} the
"[[transition risk]{.mark}" of climate policy,
**[especially]{.mark}**]{.underline} about [a [sudden re-pricing of
assets]{.mark}]{.underline}.43

A [[sudden devaluation]{.mark} of energy companies [will
occur]{.mark}]{.underline} only [if expectations were not adjusted in
accordance]{.underline} with [the risk of **asset
stranding**]{.underline}. [Sudden changes in the stringency]{.underline}
of carbon policies, or expectations [in the presence of tipping points
[can lead to **abrupt** repricing of **fossil fuel**]{.mark}
assets]{.underline}. Given energy companies\' size and interrelation
with the rest of the economy, policymakers may regard energy companies
as "too big to fail." For this and other political economy reasons,44
policymakers may opt for compensation policies, and investors may expect
them to do so. Compensations, then, are almost a self-fulfilling
prophecy: if they are expected, they will be necessary in order to avoid
larger shocks.45 Therefore, understanding the interaction between policy
making and investors' expectations is essential for the design of
climate policies. Our results suggest that early and credible commitment
to climate policies and whether they involve compensation payments or
not is crucial. Such clear signals to financial markets can avoid a
disruptive and unorderly energy transition and macro shocks, while
directing capital towards climate-friendly technologies. We believe that
further research in similar contexts can help to generalize these
results, or to identify the important factors in the formation of
expectations regarding climate related risks.

started by Moscow. He also covers other areas of geopolitics; 4-23-2025;

Accessed 7-18-2025; AY\]

Russia\'s government has predicted the [price of its oil will plummet to
its lowest level in half a decade, posing a challenge to the country\'s
sanction-hit economy.]{.underline}

Russia\'s Economic Development Ministry downgraded its 2025 forecast for
Urals crude, Russia\'s major oil export brand, to \$56 a barrel. This
would be its lowest level since 2020 when the COVID pandemic sparked a
collapse in global demand for the country\'s major export.

Experts have told Newsweek that oil offers U.S. President Donald Trump
leverage in pressuring Vladimir Putin as the Russian president delays
agreeing to any peace deal to end the war he started against Ukraine.

[Meanwhile, lower prices of the energy export come as a report from the
London School of Economics\' foreign policy think tank, LSE IDEAS, said
that Ukraine\'s economic resilience may outlast the Russian oil-funded
war machine.]{.underline}

Why It Matters

Oil prices are crashing due to global economic concerns and increased
OPEC+ production[. Oil exports are a key driver of Russia\'s economy,
making it the focus of Western-led sanctions, which have aimed to choke
funds for Moscow\'s war machine.]{.underline}

However, [Russia has circumvented a \$60 price cap on a barrel of
seaborne crude with a shadow fleet of vessels whose ownership is
reorganized to hide links to Moscow.]{.underline}

As major purchasers of Russian oil, such as India and China, become more
reluctant to risk secondary sanctions in buying the commodity, [a slump
in its price poses a further problem for Russia\'s
revenues.]{.underline}

What to Know

Russia\'s Economic Development Ministry has reduced its 2025 forecast
for the average price of Urals crude to \$56 per barrel, which is well
below the estimated \$69 price that Russia\'s budget is based on and the
lowest since the pandemic caused a collapse in demand.

It is also less than the \$60-a-barrel tipping point, above which
profits from oil exports are added to Russia\'s sovereign wealth fund
via taxes. Revenues below this cut-off are covered by drawing from the
fund, which as of April 1, held 3.27 trillion rubles (\$39.8 billion) in
liquid assets.

Berlin-based energy analyst Thomas O\'Donnell told Newsweek that
[plunging Urals crude prices would put serious constraints on the
Russian budget, but they won\'t stop the war.\]{.underline}

Net Exporters Benefit as Oil Prices Increase

Net energy exporters like Russia, on the other hand, see their export
revenues rise alongside crude oil and natural gas prices. [Oil and gas
accounted for 60% of Russia\'s exports and 39% of federal budget revenue
in 2019.]{.underline} The energy sector is estimated to contribute up to
25% of the country\'s gross domestic product (GDP).

Conversely, when energy prices drop, big exporters like Russia suffer.
[The 2014 oil price collapse badly hurt Russia\'s economy. Between June
and December 2014, the Russian ruble declined in value by 58 to 60%
relative to the U.S. dollar]{.underline}, fueling inflation that forced
the Russian central bank to raise interest rates as high as 17%. As a
result, Russia\'s PPP decreased from 3.76 trillion in 2014 to 3.53
trillion in 2015.

[Russia also receives less economic benefit from lower pump prices than
the U.S. does, because Russians consume much less oil and gas than
Americans.]{.underline} In 2021, with crude oil prices hitting
seven-year highs, Russia reaped a windfall. Budget revenue increased 35%
from 2020, while its current account surplus rose to 7% of GDP. [Higher
energy prices supported a broad economic recovery, with GDP up 10.5%
year-over-year in Q2 2021 before slowing to a 4.3% annual gain as of
Q3.]{.underline} Every month between January 2023 and April 2024, Russia
exported €750 million per month of oil.

In contrast with what has just been reviewed, the current debate on the
low-carbon transition has so far focused on financial risk from sunset
industries. The simple reason is that to achieve the Paris agreement
targets, many currently productive enterprises have to radically alter
their production. In particular, a good share of the emissions from
currently known fossil fuel reserves must be suppressed (Carbon
Tracker, [2013](https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.678#wcc678-bib-0044);

(Caldecott, [2018](https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.678#wcc678-bib-0035)),
[and]{.underline} if the stranding is widespread enough, it [could

(Monasterolo, [2020](https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.678#wcc678-bib-0145);

Consideration of sunrise industry risks, on the other hand, is absent
from the debate. While observer bias and timing may help explain some of
this neglect (for instance, before the 2007--2008 crash few commentators
pointed to a looming housing crisis), there is also some hard evidence
to cite: in investment in low-carbon technologies has been increasing
[recent decades, [but it is still **far away** from the scale necessary
to compensate for the **phase-out** of]{.mark} **fossil-based
[technologies]{.mark}**]{.underline} under a 1.5°C scenario

Nor are the investments yet expected to be vastly more
profitable---support policies have so far been required to attract
private investors even in the advanced power supply sector (Mazzucato &
Semieniuk, [2018](https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.678#wcc678-bib-0134);
Polzin, Egli, Steffen, &
Schmidt, [2019](https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.678#wcc678-bib-0165)).
Of course, the fast market capitalization growth in some low-carbon
companies such as Ørsted, market leader in offshore wind projects, or
Tesla, an electric car maker, are examples of (so-far) successful
sunrise companies to point to (Financial
Times, [2020a](https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.678#wcc678-bib-0079), [2020b](https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.678#wcc678-bib-0080)).
And there have already been instances of initially hyped low-carbon
companies collapsing just as if their potential had been overestimated
by Schumpeterian speculators, including photovoltaic cell makers
Solarworld in Germany and Solyndra in the US. However, these instances
hardly triggered systemic financial instability, just as the burst of
the YieldCo bubble in the US in 2015 (which saw share prices drop by
60%) did not destabilize wider stock markets
(CPI, [2016](https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.678#wcc678-bib-0053)).
In short, at this moment, [[there does not]{.mark} yet [seem to be a
general "**mania**"]{.mark} in the low-carbon sunrise
industries]{.underline}.

The situation in 2020 by itself does not represent a radical overturn in
the oil and gas market, but it signifies major adjustments of the market
landscape in the coming years. The key factor is the excess supply of
oil and gas against the background of reduced demand in the presence of
commissioned but idling production capacity. This situation generates
significant risks of price volatility and necessitates the need for
stabilization mechanisms. In such conditions, the [[preferences of
investors are changing, as they become increasingly wary of investing
in]{.mark} conventional [oil]{.mark} and gas [projects]{.mark} with long
payback periods]{.underline}. In the global paradigm of the oil and gas
market, this [[means]{.underline}]{.mark} that [historical
[**consumption peaks** will occur]{.mark} at [lower]{.mark} levels [than
predicted before]{.mark} the **[COVID]{.mark}-19
pandemic**]{.underline}.

#### Clean energy prices are too high for [widespread]{.underline} adoption, but the transition enables lower prices than oil.

[So how will the [transition to clean energy]{.mark} affect
the]{.underline} location and design of [future
manufacturing]{.underline}? A key feature of most renewable sources is
that the energy they produce is very expensive to transport beyond the
local power grid. [Currently, sunny regions can [generate
electricity]{.mark} for less than \$20 per megawatt hour]{.underline},
which is [[equivalent to]{.mark} the [price of oil at **\$34 per
barrel**]{.mark}]{.underline}, less than half the current market price
of crude oil.\
[[By contrast, the]{.underline}]{.mark} (misnamed)
[**[I]{.mark}**nflation **[R]{.mark}**eduction
**[A]{.mark}**ct]{.underline}, U.S. President Joe Biden\'s flagship

convert renewable energy into green hydrogen]{.underline} at \$3 per
kilogram of hydrogen, which is [[equivalent to \$142]{.mark}.2 [per
barrel]{.mark} of oil]{.underline}, twice the current price of oil. In
other words, storing solar energy in transportable molecules is very
expensive. Consequently, it is more efficient to use it where it is
produced.

prices, and uncertainty surrounding economic policy: indications from
the United States,\" SN Business & Economics, Volume 4, Number 22,

According to the results of the study, there are interconnected
relationships and influences between economic policy uncertainty,
environmentally friendly stocks, and petroleum prices in the United
States. [[There is a **higher spillover effect** from green stocks
**on oil prices** than from oil]{.mark}
prices [on]{.mark} green [stocks]{.mark}]{.underline}. Uncertainty
causes more shocks to the stock performance of green stock companies.
The influence of fluctuations in oil prices on the level of uncertainty
in economic policy carries greater weight than the impact of economic
policy uncertainty on the price of oil. When considering external
economic factors such as Brent oil prices and uncertainty in global
economic policies, the interconnectivity of the system becomes more
profound. US oil price-green stock connectedness can also be explained
by other economic variables that are outside the economic sphere of the
US. [Research]{.underline} has [discovered]{.underline} that the
existence of [[uncertainty]{.underline}]{.mark} in economic policies
[[intensifies]{.mark} the [correlation]{.mark} between the values
of green stocks and oil prices]{.underline}, irrespective of the

Transitions Are Alike: Disentangling the Effects of Demand and
Supply-Side Policies on Future Oil Prices,\" International Monetary
Fund, Working Paper Number 2023/160, christian

The [economic literature]{.underline} has typically
[assumed]{.underline} that [[fossil fuel prices will be negatively
affected by climate policies]{.underline}]{.mark} (see e.g., Nordhaus
and Boyer, 2000, Hassler and Krusell, 2012, van der Ploeg and Rezai,
2020). For example, the International Energy Agency (2022) estimates
that prices will decline as fossil fuel consumption falls by 60 percent
until 2050 in a net-zero emissions scenario. The [implicit assumption is
that the energy transition is [driven by]{.mark} a series of negative
fossil-fuel demand shocks. Subsidies to electric cars, for instance,
cause [negative]{.mark} crude-[oil specific **demand shocks**, as oil is
substituted with electricity]{.mark}]{.underline}, leading to lower
prices.

This paper shows that a declining global fossil fuel production path can
also arise from curbing fossil fuel production (i.e., from negative
supply shocks), leading to increasing oil prices over the long term.
This is in line with theoretical models by Hoel (1994) and Harstad
(2012), where oil prices can increase in the face of supply-side climate
policies. For example, climate regulation may directly restrict oil
production while public preferences may shift in favor of sustainable
investment---thereby, increasing the cost of capital for fossil fuels
companies and, eventually, lowering oil supply (Delis et al., 2019,
Ehlers et al., 2022, Seltzer et al., 2022). Higher policy uncertainty
could also lead to a decline in fossil fuel investment (Bogmans et al.,
2023). Importantly, as policies are mostly formulated at the country
level and the mix between demand side and supply side policies is hard
to predict at the global level, the energy transition raises uncertainty
about the price outlook.

[[We apply structural scenario analysis]{.underline}]{.mark} following
Antol ́ın-D ́ıaz et al. (2021) [[to model the impact]{.mark} of the
energy transition on oil prices]{.underline} as a sequence of either
oil-specific demand or oil supply shocks. The
[[derived]{.underline}]{.mark} shock [[series match]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [global oil [consumption scenarios]{.mark} from 2023 to
2030]{.underline} (and in an extension to 2050) [[from the
**I**]{.mark}nternational **[E]{.mark}**nergy
**[A]{.mark}**gency]{.underline} (2022). In other words, our structural
approach finds series of shocks that incentivize the oil consumption and
output paths in line with the scenarios. We then derive the implied
scenario price paths. [Modelling]{.underline} the energy transition [in
this way]{.underline} has the advantage that [we can distinguish among
structural supply and demand shocks]{.underline}, which have
substantially different implications for prices.

[We find that if we only consider demand-side policies, [oil prices
could decline to **\$25**]{.mark} (inflation-adjusted) **[in
2030]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This would have negative consequences for
oil producers as both prices and volumes would decline. Rents would
diminish and oil production would come under pressure in high-cost
regions changing its current geographical distribution and moving
towards a more concentrated market.

[[Resource-rich countries]{.underline}]{.mark}, overwhelmed by income
from resource sales, [have]{.underline} three
[[options]{.underline}]{.mark} that are listed here in decreasing order
of economic efficiency: (i) [forced investment strategies that [use
income for modernising the economy]{.mark}]{.underline} in an attempt to
prepare the country for a period in which income from resources falls,
but which may overstress the adaptation capacities of societies; (ii)
[[investment]{.mark} in]{.underline} funds in
[[prep]{.underline}]{.mark}aration [for [periods of declining
sales]{.mark}]{.underline}[;]{.mark} (iii) [[domestic use]{.mark},
which]{.underline} in most cases [[overstresses the absorption
capacities]{.underline}]{.mark} of national economies and leads to price
hikes in local goods, endogenous deindustrialisation and a revaluation
of the currency, thus reducing national competitiveness. This follows
transfer theory (Samuelson, 1964; Balassa, 1964) and is the basis of
what is called the resource curse (Auty and Mikesell, 1993).2

[The]{.underline} three [[strategies]{.underline}]{.mark} often [[appear
as hybrids]{.underline}]{.mark}; however, dominant characteristics can
be identified. For example, Shah Reza Pahlavi applied the first strategy
in the 1960s and 1970s when trying to propel Iran into modernity. This
failed because of inner opposition but left the mullahs with a
formidable industry structure. Today, Norway commands one of the world's
largest investment funds. The Netherlands, on the other hand, spent gas
income on domestic programmes that led to price hikes followed by wage
increases in the non-tradable sector that subsequently spilled over into
manufacturing. The loss of competitiveness drove the rail, car and
aircraft industries out of the markets. It is known as the Dutch disease
or the East German disease because of the similar effects of the
stabilisation transfers from West Germany after unification (Blum,
2008).

It is clear that the [loss of criticality will **hit**]{.underline} a
[[type iii country hardest]{.underline}]{.mark}, and even if type ii
funds are available, they may be syphoned off. Moreover, [this
may]{.underline} completely [**reverse** financial flows]{.underline} in
large countries and [have a **devastating** effect]{.underline} on
international financial stability. Oil has been a critical resource for
a long time; however, this is beginning to change. We use the Kingdom of
**[[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [a major oil]{.underline}
[producer]{.underline}, as a reference. The country [is in [**danger**
of **economic collapse**]{.mark} if **oil [prices]{.mark}** [suddenly
**fall**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- which is not beyond the realm of
possibility.

The remainder of the article is organised as follows: In the next
section, we analyse the roots of crises from a resource perspective.
Using oil as an example, we point to the problem of managing financial
inflows efficiently and to the impact of geostrategic rivalry. We then
concentrate on two major factors that have led to a regime change in the
balance between global oil production and consumption: fracking and
defossilisation.3 We subsequently apply this to Saudi Arabia and point
to the medium- to long-term challenges for global stability given this
regime change. Finally, we conclude that a [substantial [turnaround
in]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[investment]{.underline}**]{.mark} management
[is **required**]{.underline} of (Middle Eastern) oil-producing
countries [to [**guarantee** **global stability**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Geostrategic environment, critically, and crisis

Cheap oil has promoted the rapid industrialization of the Western world
and benefited oil-exporting countries by providing a sufficient influx
of oil money, especially to those that joined forces and co-founded the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to set oil
prices.4 Many of these oil-rich countries have achieved oil-driven
economic growth and joined the group of middle- and high-income
countries.

[[Oil]{.mark} has been [a critical energy resource]{.mark}]{.underline}
since the 19th century. In 2018, crude oil made up 33% of the world's
annual primary energy consumption (BP Energy, 2020). Since its wide
industrial use from the late 19th century onwards, partly due to
Rockefeller's efforts to monopolise the oil market and then the
antitrust-led breakup of the Standard Oil Company, global oil
consumption and production have been steadily increasing. In the 21st
century, soaring demand in emerging economies has compensated for the
stagnating oil demand from the developed world.

Today, [[oil]{.underline}]{.mark} still [has a]{.underline} relatively
[[**low degree** of **substitution**]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly
[[with]{.mark} respect to **[tech]{.mark}**]{.underline}nology
(transport sector, chemicals) [[and]{.underline}
**[transport]{.underline}**]{.mark} (large tankers, pipelines). This
guarantees a stable demand despite volatile prices. Empirical [[studies
support]{.underline}]{.mark} the relatively [low price
[elasticity]{.mark}]{.underline} of the global oil demand, especially in
the short run (Cooper, 2003; Caldara et al., 2016). [Due to]{.underline}
its [[low **substitutability**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and]{.underline}
the **[[oligopolistic]{.underline}]{.mark}** [market]{.underline}
[[structure]{.mark}, oil has provided]{.underline} its [[suppliers
with]{.underline}]{.mark} a steady stream of
[[revenues]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Having experienced an ever-increasing demand for fossil fuel, the second
half of the 20th century was besieged by the economic threat of "peak
oil". However, this concern about a negative supply shock has now mainly
shifted to "peak demand". According to recent predictions, [oil's
dominance]{.underline}, and therefore criticality, [will **decrease**
rapidly]{.underline} in the coming 30 years. The [[main driver]{.mark}
of]{.underline} th[is]{.underline} profound [[shift in mindset]{.mark}
is environmental [concerns]{.mark}]{.underline} about greenhouse gas
emissions. In addition, fracking turned the US from an importer to an
exporter of oil and gas. This has not only put pressure on prices, it
decoupled the US strategically from the Middle East as a military
safeguard of global oil supplies. In response, Saudi Arabia launched an
oil price offensive, trying to drive the US fracturing industry from the
market and indirectly hitting its biggest regional rival, Iran, in its
strategy to modernise its industries. In fact, Saudi Arabia had switched
from swing pricing, which tries to pricing, which tries to equilibrate
oil prices to levels that satisfy both producers and consumers, to limit
pricing.

The apparent oil price conflict described above is not only a multipolar
economic war (Blum, 2020), it is also a hybrid military war in which
economic rivalry serves as an essential and embedded driver. US fracking
has not only reduced the scarcity on the international oil market, it
has also reminded the traditional supplier countries of the finiteness
of their competitive position, something which defossilisation is
further eroding. Gundersen (2020), for instance, calculates that the US
import shock, reflecting its domestic shale oil supply shock, accounts
for 13% of the global oil price variation from 2003 to 2015, while OPEC
explains about 17% of this variation. Saudi limit pricing led to a
technology drive that more than halved initial fracking costs from over
US \$80 per barrel to about US \$30 per barrel.

Defossilisation and oil's path towards non-criticality

Since the 19th century, the temperature of the Earth has risen by 1.14
degrees Celsius, resulting in observable negative impacts on its
ecosystems. Climatologists today can identify a highly likely (95%)
causality between human activity and global warming (IPCC, 2014). If
carbon dioxid net emissions do not decrease, further warming will cause
irreversible damage to the environment. Compared to all anthropogenic
greenhouse gas sources, fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes
accounted for about 78% of total emissions from 1970 to 2010 (IPCC,
2014). Therefore, the necessity of limiting global warming through
defossilisation gained political and social acceptance and led to the
2016 Paris Agreement. Its ultimate goal is to keep the rise in global
temperatures in this century to well below two degrees Celsius above the
pre-industrial level or even below 1.5 degrees Celsius. To meet this
goal, the entire world must achieve zero net carbon emissions by around
2065, with the odds of reaching the target exceeding 66% (Rogelj et al.,
2015). Recently, the German Constitutional Court ruled that government
implementation programmes must reflect the environmental positions of
younger generations, thus pressing for more realistic reduction plans
(BVerfG, 2021). A district court in The Hague ruled that Shell must
drastically cut its greenhouse gas emissions because international
climate agreements are also binding to enterprises. All of this will put
additional pressure on oil prices.

From another angle, the projected expansion of renewables mirrors a
potentially sharp reduction in the market share of oil. During 2018 and
2020, renewable energy production grew at an annual rate of 6%. If the
climate targets are met by 2050, the share of renewables in primary
energy would increase from 4.7% to a value between 44.3% and 59.2%
according to BP's Energy Outlook (2020). It further forecasts a 55% and
80% fall in oil demand in two intense decarbonisation scenarios, meeting
the target of two and 1.5 degrees Celsius, respectively.6 The report
also conjectured that oil demand peaked already in 2018; henceforth,
global oil demand would trend downward. Following the World Energy
Outlook (IEA, 2020), its "net zero emissions by 2050" would lead to a
fall in the present value of the world's oil sector by almost 50% by
2040 compared to 2019, and pre-COVID-19 consumption patterns would not
be reached before 2023. Shocks may drive up the price, e.g. as OPEC+
chooses to curb supply or the Houthis attack Saudi facilities. However,
for many oil-producing countries, oil prices may just oscillate around
their fiscal breakeven oil prices (IMF, 2020).

Vulnerability and the Saudi Arabia's position

Saudi Arabia is typical of a country that has earned its national wealth
from crude oil reserves. In the first decade of the new millennium,
Saudi Arabia was the number one global oil supplier. Later, the United
States overtook it and Russia with its fracking revolution. This is
depicted in Figure 2. As a result, despite the absolute increase in its
oil production, Saudi Arabia witnessed a shrinkage of its global oil
share.

[[Saudi]{.mark} Arabia's [oil]{.mark} revenues are substantial
[relative]{.mark} to [its economic size]{.mark}]{.underline}, as
different indicators in Figure 3 document. In the first two decades of
the 21st century, the oil sector accounted for around 40% of Saudi
Arabia's total GDP and contributed to about three-quarters of its
governmental revenues. [In [2019]{.mark}, [oil revenues]{.mark} made
up]{.underline} about [[64.1% of its government's annual
revenue]{.mark}s]{.underline}, and the oil sector contributed over 40%
to Saudi Arabia's real GDP. As a relatively small economy with little
industrial diversification, Saudi Arabia has to sell most of its oil
reserves to the rest of the world and is therefore intensively engaged
in the oil trade. In the new millennium, Saudi Arabia's export-to-GDP
ratio has averaged about 40%, 85% of which are mineral exports.

The [high [**importance** of oil]{.mark} in]{.underline} the composition
of [[Saudi]{.mark} Arabia's **[GDP]{.mark}** is]{.underline} also
[[depicted]{.underline}]{.mark} in Figure 4. [It shows]{.underline} the
[enduring **problem** of phasing out [oil]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[dependency]{.underline}**]{.mark}, which is difficult because oil
plays a major in fiscal stability. The IMF estimates that Saudi Arabia's
external and fiscal breakeven oil prices in 2020 are US \$45.3 and US
\$66 per barrel, respectively. Given the long-term price projections, a
depletion of Saudi Arabia's investment funds starts to become a reality.

production volume," states the company's bond prospectus of April 2019.
"Its reserves, operational capabilities and spare capacity allow it to
increase production in response to demand."4

[The kingdom's former energy minister]{.underline}, Khalid al-Falih,
gave voice to the strategic plan outlined here, when he
[predicted]{.underline} in 2019 [that no other oil producer would
survive longer.]{.underline} "Saudi Arabia is the most prolific basin
for oil and gas. We have the best resources and the best capabilities
and we are going to produce the last drop of oil," al-Falih said.5

[**[The expansion of]{.underline}**]{.mark} hydrocarbon
**[[production]{.mark}, refining, conversion, and marketing [outlined
in]{.mark} Saudi [Aramco's]{.mark} 2019 bond [prospectus amounts
to]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}a
[**[determination]{.underline}**]{.mark} to be the "last man standing"
in global oil markets. That ambition runs at cross-purposes to global
decarbonization efforts, and [presumes]{.underline} that [oil will be
difficult to replace]{.underline} in transportation sectors like
aviation, while retaining increasing non-combustion applications in
chemical and plastics manufacture. 6 **[Aramco's plan appears to
leverage worldleading advantages]{.underline}** in unit costs (\$7.50
per barrel) and upstream carbon intensity (5g CO2 per megajoule), along
with a 40-year exclusive concession agreement -- which can be extended

of [any other company in the world: \$244 billion]{.mark} in
EBITDA.]{.underline}** 7

The Aramco bond prospectus and other company statements infer that
**[[Saudi Arabia will not voluntarily phase out oil]{.mark} production
and concede the market]{.underline}** to competitors **[[while]{.mark}
oil [demand still exists]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Rather, the company
will await signals from the global oil-consuming public that demand for
oil is finally satiated.8 [[The \$244 billion in]{.mark} 2018
[revenues]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}cited above [were split almost
evenly with the Saudi government]{.underline}: \$111 billion for Aramco

of government revenues]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In 2018 overall,
**[Aramco [contributed 43% of Saudi Arabia's GDP]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

[The Saudi gamble is that oil retains a role]{.underline} in a
climate-stressed world, [and that Saudi Arabia retains its business
model]{.underline} even [after other oil companies have
failed]{.underline} or moved to other lines of business. At its core,
Aramco's "last man standing" approach amounts to a response to three
important calculations:

• First, that [**[regime survival and external security remain reliant
on]{.underline}**]{.mark} regime control over **[[oil
rents]{.underline}]{.mark}**, replacement of which constitutes a lengthy
and uncertain process.

• Second, that [the risks to Saudi Arabia]{.underline} implied [by of a
loss of oil rents outweigh the risks]{.underline} (in the view of Saudi
elites) [of a changing climate]{.underline}, whether to the climate of
the Arabian Peninsula or the Earth more broadly. [This view is bolstered
by interpreting petro-state climate strategy as a collective action
problem]{.underline}, i.e., that [climate damage will be little affected
by a premature winding up of Saudi Aramco, if other firms]{.underline}
continue to [market oil.]{.underline}

• Third, even in a world that is serious about decarbonization, some
uses for oil remain. Saudi Arabia, as the most competitive producer,
retains a strong cost advantage that is complemented by the low carbon
intensity of Saudi oil production.10 These attributes allow Saudi Aramco
to present itself as the optimal choice to serve a climate-stressed
market, even one in decline.

Saudi climate policy calculations are far from unique, however. Myriad
fossil fuel producing states are confronting similar calculations. In
autocratic polities in particular, policymakers are unlikely to find
attractive replacements for the copious oil rents deployed to achieve
social quiescence amid minimal taxation or political participation.
Low-cost producers that manage to achieve low fiscal breakevens appear
to be best placed to participate the longest.11

Internally, **[Saudi [Aramco's extraordinary
rents]{.mark}]{.underline}** are the substantive element that
**[[persuade]{.underline}]{.mark}**s **[[the]{.mark} Saudi [public to
support]{.mark} the [al-Saud]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the family that so
dominates political life that the kingdom bears its name. Externally,
[oil and the capacity to adjust production]{.underline} -- and the
willingness to do so in concert with US interventions -- [are behind the
kingdom's strategic power]{.underline}, its embrace and defense by
powerful allies, and its lofty geopolitical stature. These are elusive
accomplishments for exporters of primary products. **[[Protecting the
business]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- regardless of its environmental
drawbacks -- **[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** therefore **[[a strategic and
economic imperative]{.mark} for the kingdom and its ruling
family]{.underline}**.

#### Saudi oil revenue is strong and key to growth and diversification.

Anant **Chandak** 10/23/**2024**, polling correspondent, \"Saudi Arabian
economic growth to accelerate in 2025 as oil taps open: Reuters poll,\"

https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/saudi-arabian-economic-growth-accelerate-2025-oil-taps-open-2024-10-23/

Economic [**[growth]{.underline}** in Saudi]{.mark} Arabia [will
**[accelerate]{.underline}**]{.mark} next year [thanks]{.mark} [to
**[higher oil output]{.underline}**]{.mark} after two years of modest
performance, according to a Reuters poll of economists, who also
forecast robust growth for other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by
Russia, known as [OPEC]{.mark}+, [has been curbing]{.mark} oil
[output]{.mark} [since]{.mark} late [2022 but is expected to increase
production]{.mark} in December, likely **[boosting
revenues]{.underline}** for the six GCC countries.

Crude oil prices are expected to remain broadly weak and average \$76.75
per barrel next year, up from around \$74.8 currently, according to a
separate Reuters poll.

Saudi Arabia, the world\'s largest exporter of crude oil, is reportedly
preparing to abandon its unofficial target of reaching \$100 per barrel.
This will allow the kingdom to reverse past production cuts and increase
market share, which along with non-oil revenue growth, will help drive
faster economic growth.

The Oct. 9-22 Reuters poll of 21 economists forecast the Saudi economy
would expand 4.4% in 2025, the fastest in three years, and up from an
expected 1.3% this year.

The GCC economies were forecast to expand an average 4.1% next year, up
from the 3.7% expected in a July poll and faster than the 1.8% growth
projected for 2024.

\"We expect the effects of **[[lower]{.mark} oil
[prices]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and **[higher production
volumes]{.underline}**]{.mark} (to) largely
(**[[offset]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [each other]{.mark}. Since growth is
focusing on produced volumes, [real]{.mark} GDP [growth will still
benefit]{.mark} and accelerate in 2025 relative to 2024,\" said Ralf
Wiegert, head of MENA economics at S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Prominent economies in the region, [Saudi]{.mark} Arabia, the United
Arab Emirates, and Qatar, [have been exploring ways to diversify]{.mark}
from relying on oil as their main revenue source, with many economists
predicting the growth rate in non-oil GDP will be largely in line with
oil GDP next year.

\"However, [oil]{.mark} revenues will [play a critical role]{.mark} for
all of the three economies. Even in the long-term outlook,
[**[non-oil]{.underline}** revenues will be **[unable to
replace]{.underline}** **[oil]{.underline}**]{.mark} revenues,\" Wiegert

[Saudi Arabia is the main global exporter of crude oil, and its economy
has relied on oil revenue for decades.]{.underline} The government has
accumulated a large enough surplus that it is able to not only pay its
debt but also accumulate reserve assets. In 2014, Saudi Arabia had the
19th largest economy in the world, and the largest economy in the Middle
East and North Africa region. [Saudi Arabia's GDP is 85% reliant on the
oil sector]{.underline}, especially after 2003 when crude oil prices and
exports increased heavily. Smaller industries such as light
manufacturing, food processing, and packaging have played a minor role
in Saudi economy, and mostly domestically rather than internationally.
However, oil prices have never been stable, a fact that has made Saudi
Arabia's economy vulnerable to the fluctuating prices. [The global
prices of oil have been decreasing, leading to drastic effects on the
Saudi economy.]{.underline} Specifically, the price of a barrel went
from around \$104 in 2014 to \$70 in 2018. Because of the nation's large
reserve of assets, it has been able to cope with the economic
instability resulting from oil price drop in the 1990s and today. Oil is
a nonrenewable natural resource, which means that the amount of oil that
is present on Earth today is the only amount available for the next
centuries to come. The rate of replenishment of oil reserves is lower
than the rate of human consumption of the resource; thus, oil reserves
will likely deplete in the coming 25 to 30 years if the trend of
consumption does not change.

[A slight drop of oil prices affected the economy of Saudi Arabia and
led to drastic changes in state policies. Saudi Arabia applied for a
loan of 10 billion dollars from the IMF in 2016, its first after decades
of living debt free.]{.underline} Furthermore, it also started imposing
taxes such as family taxes of 100 Saudi Riyals per member (roughly equal
to \$27), whereas citizens did not pay any taxes in earlier years. Given
that Saudi Arabia's economy relies heavily on the oil sector and
industries, how would Saudi Arabia be influenced by the depletion of
crude oil reserves? This paper will argue that although [Saudi Arabia
will face economic and political difficulties]{.underline}, it will not
collapse completely. It would sustain its political stability by relying
on coercion and a strengthening of its Wahhabi religious identity. On
the other hand, it will try to keep its economic stability by seeking
assistance from its current allies and establishing new alliances.
Economic aid will focus on diversification of Saudi economy rather than
keeping the current rentier state system, in which [the state relies on
exports of natural resources for revenue]{.underline} instead of
civilian taxes, thus making it independent from and unaccountable to its
citizens.

\'conservative\' on oil revenue as it pares back Vision 2030 plans",
AL-MONITOR,

Saudi Arabia remains "conservative" when it is forecasting its revenues
from oil, its main commodity, the country\'s finance minister, Mohammed
Al-Jaadan, said Tuesday after [the kingdom had to pare back some of its
Vision 2030 plans due to crude prices remaining under \$100 a
barrel.]{.underline}

The price of WTI Crude, a global benchmark, was hovering around \$77.77
per barrel Tuesday early afternoon Eastern Time. [It hasn\'t reached
triple digits since summer 2022. A sluggish demand from China, the
world\'s and Saudi Arabia\'s biggest crude customer, has meant that
global demand has been lower than anticipated, keeping prices
low.]{.underline}

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\'s Vision 2030 plan is to
diversify the kingdom\'s economy away from a reliance on oil by
investing in other sectors such as green energy, technology and tourism.
[Saudi Arabia is currently the world\'s largest crude exporter, and its
fast-growing economy has been hit by lower oil prices globally. Some 63%
of the kingdom\'s revenues come from oil.]{.underline}

Speaking at the Qatar Economic Forum in Doha on Tuesday, [Jaadan warned
that being a resource-rich country was a curse]{.underline} as well as a
blessing [because being dependent on one commodity such as oil can hold
a country \"hostage\" to the volatility of global demand and
prices.]{.underline}

Gigaprojects such as Neom and The Line are central to Saudi Arabia\'s
Vision 2030 plan. Last month, reports emerged that the government had
scaled back its medium-term ambition for Neom, the \$1.5 trillion green
megacity project in the middle of the desert, of which The Line is its
most significant subproject. Authorities had originally planned for 1.5
million residents to live in The Line but scaled back its ambitions to
around 300,000. [The low oil price is one of the key reasons for this
downward revision]{.underline}, analysts say.

For example, he said Saudi Arabia closed 2023 with oil revenues higher
than the government budget projections from the beginning of the year.
He said that this was despite the fact [oil prices were down around 20%
and production was down by 17%.]{.underline}

The minister said his country\'s high spending is helping to grow the
non-oil economy, but he warned [Saudi Arabia needs to be careful about
its investments "overheating" --- which could cause inflation to
accelerate --- and "economic leakages."]{.underline}

Second, just as [the [oil]{.mark} industry]{.underline} will continue to
play a role on a global scale through the energy transition, so too
[[will]{.underline}]{.mark} it [[be **instrumental** in the

### IL -- Oil Key -- Middle East

#### Oil is the [backbone]{.underline} of Gulf State stability -- sustainable revenue is [key]{.underline} to [regional loyalty]{.underline}.

Middle East and North Africa Sciences, vol. 6, no. 6, pp. 12-15

[The **consensus** among scholars]{.underline} and practitioners, both
in the region and abroad, [is that [the **biggest risk**
to]{.mark}]{.underline} manage by [the [Gulf monarchies is]{.mark}
related to [their]{.mark} political and [economic model]{.mark} which
has been [based on **buying**]{.mark}]{.underline} [the
**[loyalty]{.mark} of the population** [by issuing **generous
subsidies** and]{.mark} **social [benefits]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Byman
& Green, 1999). [[This]{.mark} strategy [can be]{.mark}]{.underline}
also [understood as **[the backbone of]{.mark}**]{.underline} all
security policies pertaining to Gulf monarchies to ensure national and
**[[regional stability]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Safran, 1985).

Gulf countries are aware about the risks associated to the excessive
dependence to oil and gas. To attempt to solve that reliance, [Gulf
economies]{.underline} [have been]{.underline} designing some strategies
[aiming at diversifying their revenue streams]{.underline} over the last
years.

Economic diversification strategies are very much related to the
development of the private sector and the development of local
entrepreneurship. Due to a booming economic expansion which required
skilled labor, since the 1970s GCC countries have implemented an
open-door policy to attract foreign manpower. As a result, since early
2000s, three fourths of GCC manpower is not native (Fasano & Iqbal,
2003). Therefore programs to increase local manpower such as
Emiratization in the UAE or Omanization in Oman have been part and
parcel of the local initiatives to increase --directly and indirectly-
local private initiative and entrepreneurship without the expected
success (Al-Shanfari, 2012).

Since 1992 the UAE, among other initiatives, have been implementing the
Tawazun Economic Program with the objective of diversifying the economy
and promoting local entrepreneurship. Some Emirates of the UAE have been
practicing these principles consistently while embracing a pro-business
strategy emphasized by an increasing liberalization of markets and
economic openness in order to escape from the rentier state model.
However despite following these international trends, these economies
--emulating the "Dubai model" have refrained from removing the basic
structures of the traditional neopatrimonial leadership (Hvidt, 2011).
Although the basis for stimulating the economic diversification to
buffer the dependency from oil have been laid, the UAE still have to
fully implement and develop them (Al Sadoun, 2016).

Qatar has been following similar diversification strategy. In 2008 the
General Secretariat for Development Planning developed and implemented
the Qatar National Vision 2030 (GSDP, 2008). By following a
differentiated philosophy and approach to international relations Qatar
has been investing more on increasing its appeal as a touristic
destination and on cultural diplomacy (Eggeling, 2017; Morakabati,
Beavis & Fletcher, 2014). Nevertheless, as it is going to be explained
later, Qatar's model of understanding and playing its regional and
international role has not been appreciated by Saudi Arabia. Within a
context of low oil prices, regional and international political and
diplomatic turmoil, strong tensions and political countermeasures lead
by Saudi Arabia have hit Qatar.

Oman started to develop policies to counter oil dependency from 1976
onwards when it was created the first Five-year development plan. Since
then every five years the Sultanate has launched a quinquennial
development plan. In 1995 Oman adopted the Oman Vision 2020 with the
objective of reducing oil and gas share of GDP from 39 per cent in 1996
to 19 per cent by 2020. It was envisaged to increase non-oil and gas
economy from 6 per cent of the GDP in 1996 to 81 per cent by 2020
(Vision 2020). Against these plans by 2012 the share of oil and gas of
the GDP totalized 52.2 5 whereas non-oil and gas activities amounted to
the 4 per cent (WTO, 2014). These figures evidence that achieving a
consolidated economic diversification strategy has failed.

In 2013 it was adopted the In-Country Value (ICV) as a strategy to
further develop and harmonize both industry and societal components
(Ureta, 2017). The ICV plan, can be considered as a socio-economic and
political innovation born in the aftermaths of the Arab spring in order
to ensure stability by meeting current social demands and prevent future
revolts within an environment of uncertainty. In designing a new
strategy to achieve economic diversification, in 2015, the Sultanate
developed the Oman Vision 2040.

From its side, Saudi Arabia implemented its National Transformation
Program (Saudi Vision 2030) to revert some risks associated to the
effects of the possible oil curse by boosting private entrepreneurial
activities from 2020 onward. The initial investment for the 2016-2021
period was budgeted in SR296bn (Saudi Vision 2030). Further explanations
focusing on the Saudi case follow in the next section.

In considering all cases, it is evident that [[if low oil prices **carry
on**]{.mark} for extended periods]{.underline} of time, and sustainable
economic diversification is not attained progressively, the
possibilities of funding [these [programs may be
**doomed**]{.mark}]{.underline} to fail [[and]{.mark} therefore
the]{.underline} possible **[[collapse of regimes may be
likely]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

As the graph 2 shows, all studied countries have relaxed their
legislations aiming at reducing the bureaucracy to initiate businesses.
Despite these concessions [private business activities have not
overtaken the attractiveness of]{.underline} both [the public sector and
oil related industries]{.underline}.

Despite the wealth amassed in Gulf countries, [[**diversification
strategies** have **not been successful**]{.underline}. [The
Gulf]{.underline}]{.mark} [region **[lags]{.mark}**]{.underline} behind
advancing Asian countries [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} terms of Science and
Technology indicators (**[[S&T]{.underline}]{.mark}**). [S&T **[as well
as R&D]{.mark}** are]{.underline} mostly **[concentrated]{.underline}**
with**[in]{.underline}** [public and third education
sectors]{.underline} having small impact on the private sector (Nour,
2005). This fact highlights again the failure of bland [diversification
policies]{.underline} which [have not been consistently
implemented.]{.underline} The events of the Arab Spring challenged the
apparent stability and prosperity of Gulf nations.

6\. Monarchies Reacting to Low Oil Prices.

[The **[sustainability]{.mark}** of this security model, which is
basically a social contract, [is **strictly
bound**]{.mark}]{.underline}ed [[to]{.mark} Gulf's [monarchies
**capacity** to **keep**]{.mark}]{.underline} on

USD133bn \[USD **[133 billion]{.underline}**\] [to buy off]{.underline}
local [opposition in 2011]{.underline}. To better contextualize this
figure it's noteworthy to mention that Saudi Arabia in 2013 engaged into
a long-term investment scheme of USD133bn to build a number of power
plants and water projects over a time span of 10 years.

Due to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) keeping global oil consumption
weak, and the oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, crude oil
prices are fluctuating below \$30 per barrel since March 6 when OPEC and
non-OPEC nations failed to reach an output curb deal.

Nigeria needs a breakeven price of \$144 per barrel of Brent crude on
average to balance its government balance this year, while Bahrain
requires \$96 a barrel, according to data from global rating agency
Fitch Ratings.

Saudi Arabia, OPEC heavyweight and the world\'s largest crude exporter
need a breakeven of \$91 per barrel, while Oman needs \$82 a barrel, Abu
Dhabi requires \$65 per barrel and Qatar needs \$55 a barrel, the data
shows.

No region of the world is more immersed in the consequences of global
climate change than [the **[Middle East]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
region [[accounts]{.mark}]{.underline} for about [[30 percent of
**global** oil production]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and oil
**[rev]{.mark}**enues [drive government]{.mark} revenues [in the
region]{.mark}]{.underline}---either because the countries produce oil,
or because the countries produce a labor force that works in
oil-exporting countries [and sends money home]{.underline}. [[Because of
**oil**]{.mark} revenues]{.underline}**,** [Middle Eastern [governments
can **afford**]{.mark} to employ large percentages of their own
populations,]{.underline} and they do. [[As]{.mark} the [world
**turns**]{.mark} away [from oil]{.mark} as an energy source,
t[he]{.mark} [economics of the **Middle East** will change
**profoundly**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

At the same time, the Middle East is subject to the consequences of
climate change. The region is already desperately water poor---nine of
the ten most water-poor countries are in the Middle East. Drought is
pushing farmers off their land, the region's many coastal cities are
threatened by sea level rise, and rising summer temperatures
increasingly combine with humidity to put human survival at risk.

That is to say, the Middle East is embedded on both sides of the climate
change issue. As global consumption patterns change, the Middle East
will change profoundly; as the climate changes, the Middle East will
change profoundly as well.

While there is a lot we don't understand, one of the important issues is
pacing. To hear some people describe it, [the global **[energy
transition]{.mark}** is nigh.]{.underline} Widespread awareness of
climate change has galvanized consumers and governments alike to get
serious about abandoning hydrocarbons. The [financial world has read the
new sentiment and pivoted away from oil and gas.]{.underline}
[[Investors are now pouring **billions** into
**renewables**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline} and China sees renewable energy
as a national security imperative. Soon, [oil production [will outstrip
demand]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and [as **prices fall**]{.mark}, producers
will produce even more to make up for lower volumes, suppressing prices
still further. Oil [prices are going to drop off a
**cliff**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In addition, the [[transition to clean energy]{.underline}]{.mark} will
[wind up [augmenting]{.mark} the [influence of some]{.mark} oil and gas
[exporters by **concentrating global production**]{.mark}]{.underline}
in fewer hands. Eventually, the demand for oil will decline
significantly, but it will remain substantial for decades to come. Many
[[high-cost producers, such as those in]{.underline}]{.mark} Canada and
[[Russia]{.mark}'s Arctic territory, [could be priced out]{.mark} of the
market [as]{.mark}]{.underline} demand (and, presumably, [the price of
[oil) falls]{.mark}]{.underline}. Other oil-producing countries that
seek to be leaders when it comes to climate change---such as [Norway,
the United Kingdom, and the United States]{.underline}---could in the
future [constrain]{.underline} their [domestic output in response to
rising public pressure]{.underline} and to hasten the transition away
from fossil fuels. [[As a result]{.mark}, oil producers such as the
**[Gulf states]{.mark}**]{.underline}---which have very cheap,
low-carbon oil, are less dependent on the financial institutions now
shying away from oil, and will face little pressure to limit
production---[could [see]{.mark} their [market shares increase.
Providing]{.mark}]{.underline} more or [nearly all of the oil the world
consumes would imbue [them with **outsize geopolitical
clout**]{.mark}]{.underline}, at least until oil use declines more
markedly. Other countries whose oil industries might endure are those
whose resources can be brought online quickly---such as Argentina and
the United States, which boast large deposits of shale oil---and that
can thereby attract investors who seek faster payback periods and may
shy away from longer-cycle oil investments given the uncertainties about
oil's long-term outlook.

The [Middle East is a global producer and exporter of oil]{.underline}.
The region enjoys high returns from oil sales to many countries around
the world. [The Middle East has relied heavily on oil revenue in the
past to sustain its economies]{.underline}. In fact, many regional
[countries maintain economic stability through oil production and
export. Great Power Competitors have established themselves in the
region, intending to acquire a sustainable oil supply.]{.underline}
Countries like the US, Russia, and China battle for dominance in the
region due to good economic opportunities[. Oil has made the region a
strategic area for several countries, especially China, which needs a
large oil supply to run its industries]{.underline}. China's activities
in the Middle East increased in 2020 as it sought to create lasting
relationships with many governments in the region as a strategic
economic investment. However, the region limited oil exports in 2020 due
to increased demand for other products such as medication. [The region's
declining oil prices are a blow to its economic sustainability; hence,
regional countries need to invest in more diverse economic activities
and industries.]{.underline} These investments are intended to decrease
overreliance on oil revenue[. The region also benefits from economic
investment from strong global economies like the US, Russia, and China.
These countries' interests in the Middle East have enabled the region to
diversify its financial activities to accommodate fluctuations in oil
prices]{.underline}

#### Low oil prices collapse the global economy

The [fall in oil prices]{.underline} has been one of the most important
macro-economic events recently. While it has certainly meant lower fuel
bills for consumers, it has also [drastically reduce]{.underline}d the
[revenues of oil-exporting countries]{.underline}. We will have a look
at the impact of the drop in oil prices on the 3 leading oil-exporting
countries: Saudi Arabia, Russia and Iran, as well as on oil-importing
countries -- the US, China and India. (For related reading, see article:
What Determines Oil Prices?)

Saudi Arabia

The Saudi Arabian government is heavily dependent on oil revenues, with
almost [90% of the government's revenues coming from oil]{.underline}.
The recent fall in oil prices is likely to [result in a higher
government deficit]{.underline} and may result in [lower government
spending.]{.underline} This is bound to have a [significant impact on
job creation]{.underline} within the country, as most of the private
sector jobs that are available are based on government contracts. The
kingdom also has vast social-sector spending commitments that it
increased after the Arab Spring. Though in the short term the reduction
in revenues due to low oil prices won\'t be an issue due to the fact
that the Saudis can dip into their US\$700 billion sovereign wealth fund
for revenues, in the longer term Saudi Arabia needs around US \$104
billion to balance its budget. But even after the drastic fall in oil
prices, the Saudis haven't cut their oil production in order to push oil
prices upward. The reasons for not doing so are claimed to be entirely
political in nature, as the lower prices are likely to hurt shale oil
production in the US, which would be a long term positive for the
Saudis. (For related reading, see article: How Saudi Arabia Benefits
From Low Oil Prices.)

Russia

[Russia has]{.underline} by far [been]{.underline} one of the countries
that have been [most adversely affected by the recent plunge in oil
prices.]{.underline} Its [oil revenues, which constitute more than half
of its budget revenues and approximately 70% of its export revenues,
have dropped significantly, with an estimated US \$2 billion loss in
revenue for Russia per dollar fall in oil prices. Russia\'s currency has
as a result collapsed,]{.underline} which forced its central bank to
raise interest rates and sell its foreign currency reserves to support
the Ruble. The ensuing chaos has led to a downgrade of Russia's
sovereign bonds to junk by credit rating agencies and [resulted in
capital flight away from the country]{.underline}, all of which is
likely to [result in a contraction in the Russian GDP.]{.underline} The
Russians need oil prices to be above US \$105 a barrel to balance
Russia\'s budget; market conditions in which the prices fall below this
will either cause the Russian government to run deficits or force it to
cut down on its other development programs. (For related reading, see
article: Why the Russian Economy Rises and Falls With Oil.)

Iran

Already reeling under heavy economic sanctions imposed by Western
nations, which reduced its oil exports by more than half, Iran now has
to face the double whammy of lower oil prices. [Iran depends on oil for
slightly less than half of its total revenues and more than 80% of its
export revenues]{.underline}, so the recent fall has already led to
lower figures in its budget estimates. Though in the short term the
impact on Iran\'s economy will be cushioned by the government\'s use of
a fund that was set up to counter lower oil prices, in the longer run it
is estimated that [Iran needs oil prices to be above US \$130 to balance
its budget.]{.underline} The nuclear deal with Iran will be positive for
Iran's economy, but it would also signal that Iran\'s oil would be added
to the present supply of oil on the market, which may put further
downward pressure on oil prices.

[The oil-price crash is set to have far-reaching consequences for Saudi
Arabia's finances and vast economic ambitions.]{.underline}

[The kingdom's budget deficit may soar to \$67 billion this
year]{.underline}, according to projections shared by Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. economist Farouk Soussa in an interview.

[That calculation]{.underline}, based on oil averaging \$62 a barrel in
2025, [is well over double the government's current forecast and will
likely force Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to borro\$w more on global
bond markets and further cut back his multitrillion-dollar plans to
transform the economy.]{.underline}

[Crude has plunged to its lowest level in about four years]{.underline}
after US President Donald Trump unveiled new tariffs on almost all
countries on April 2, [raising the possibility of a global
recession]{.underline}. Within hours of that, OPEC+, an oil cartel
headed by Saudi Arabia and Russia, shocked energy traders by saying it
would speed up plans to raise output.

Brent crude recovered late on Wednesday after Trump said he'd delay some
levies, but fell again on Thursday. [At \$64 a barrel, it's still down
almost 15% in the past week. And]{.underline} [many analysts predict the
worst is to come.]{.underline}

Saudi Arabia's ministry of finance told Bloomberg it's assessing the
recent developments and stands ready to take whatever decisions are
needed to keep its fiscal position strong.

"There's going to have to be some fiscal adjustment," Soussa, Goldman's
economist for the Middle East and North Africa, said in an interview.

"We're going to see more borrowing and I do think there's got to be a
more aggressive re-prioritization when it comes to the projects," he
said. "They don't shy away from these really difficult decisions."

Even before this month's rout, [oil was too low for the kingdom to
balance its budget.]{.underline} [The government needed prices to be as
high as \$93 last year to achieve that, and \$108 if the sovereign
wealth fund's spending on the crown prince's mega projects was
included]{.underline}, according to Ziad Daoud, chief emerging markets
economist at Bloomberg Economics.

Collapses?", LobeLog,
https://lobelog.com/what-if-the-state-of-saudi-arabia-collapses/)**

To reduce Saudi Arabia's budget deficit, Vision 2030 calls for a phased
reduction of the subsidies offered to Saudi nationals and promises to
increase private sector employment[. If economic growth and job creation
fail to meet expectations, discontent could catalyze demands for liberal
political reforms that will require serious input from the kingdom's
clerics. Saudi Oger's bankruptcy and expat layoffs may be a sign of
labor shedding that is required system wide.]{.underline} According to
Saudi economist Fadl al-Boainain, "[declining corporate profitability
has made the foreign workforce a target for managements seeking to cut
fixed financial obligations]{.underline}." In January, a Saudi
businessman speculated that by the end of 2016 [one million expats may
leave the country given the financial squeeze stemming from plunging oil
prices.]{.underline}

However, successful implementation could also trigger demands for
greater reform from a rising capital class that is less economically
dependent on the state.

[Politically disenfranchised foreign nationals, the majority of Saudi
Arabia's working class, and marginalized Shi'ites in the Eastern
Province would likely echo these demands.]{.underline}
[Shi'ites]{.underline}, who have historically faced a great deal of
discrimination and extreme poverty, [have a history of anti-Al Saud
activism.]{.underline} Ultimately, [calls for reform could ignite
passionate anti-government protests, leading to uprisings that could at
least create instability even if not triggering its
collapse]{.underline}. To regain control, the regime would deploy the
Saudi Arabia National Guard (SANG), comprised of tribal forces loyal to
the monarchy. There is a key question that Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) observers are asking: If the Al Saud rulers turn to SANG to
maintain their ruler, where will other power ministries, like the
Ministry of Interior and its army of police forces, fit in this
scenario?

In addition, Vision 2030's [bureaucratic, social, and economic reforms
could also alienate key elites. The kingdom has used bureaucratic
appointments to ensure support from competing tribal and familial
factions. Consolidating or replacing these elites with technocrats would
remove their incentive to support the government in the event of a
significant threat. Altering the line of succession]{.underline} to
promote MBS, as has been suggested, [could engender further resentment
and open hostility within the royal family.]{.underline} [The older
generation of Al Saud leaders do not like bowing down before a young
prince. The possibility of greater social reforms could also alienate
the powerful religious establishment that dominates Saudi
society.]{.underline}

Vision 2030's [plan to open Saudi Aramco]{.underline}, the nation's
state-owned oil conglomerate, [to public investment]{.underline} would
also necessitate more transparency within the secretive company, which
[could expose high-level corruption and elite manipulation, further
undermining the public's trust in critical state elites and
institutions.]{.underline} "Assessment of Aramco's value by public
markets might require the disclosure of any relevant audits of Saudi oil
fields, which rumors suggest may have been conducted quite recently in
secret", wrote Perry Cammack, an associate in the Middle East Program at
the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "An IPO would require
the company to show a level of transparency unprecedented in its
history, and frankly, just as unprecedented for the ruling family."

In the event of contentious anti-government uprisings, [the monarchy
would feel pressured to offer change.]{.underline} The most likely
scenario would be the promotion of MBS, a reformer with a great deal of
youth support[. This promotion is unlikely to quell elite resentment and
could further inflame tensions among the monarchy, rival family members,
and the religious establishment.]{.underline} If MBS offers liberal
reforms[, he would likely lose the support of the ultra-conservative
Wahhabi clerics.]{.underline} Yet [if he fails to provide reforms,
resistance to the Saudi rulers could grow based on regionalism and
tribalism in the Hijaz, Nejd, or the Eastern Province]{.underline}.
[Neither scenario bodes well for the monarchy.]{.underline} Though he
has a loyal following in the military, MBS's military excursion in Yemen
has received substantial criticism, [creating the conditions for a coup
if destabilization escalates under his stewardship.]{.underline}

[Hostile elites with competing clientele bases would see state collapse
as an opening for greater power.]{.underline} Since the kingdom's
unification in 1932, an overarching Saudi identity has been elusive.
Saudi nationalism is a new concept. The state has been united by the
cooptation of elites and the promotion of Wahhabi ideology, which while
popular in the Nejd heartland faces rejection from the country's Shi'ite
minority. Not all Saudi Sunnis, meanwhile, practice this branch of Sunni
Islam.

With an embattled central state, [many tribal elites would strive to
carve out autonomous regions, restore their pre-unification authority,
and potentially dissolve the modern Saudi state]{.underline}. To exert
their power, these tribal leaders would draw defections from tribal kin
in the armed forces. [Disaffected royal family members with their own
loyal bases of support could also openly challenge King Salman's
successor]{.underline} (whoever that will be) if instability persists.

In the face of significant social upheaval, elite abandonment, and
military defection, [the SANG could not realistically prevent the state
from sliding into civil war and collapse.]{.underline} GCC states are
aware of this scenario and operational plans to contain this potential
implosion are already under consideration.

[Oil is one of the most relevant sources of energy for every country
according to
the [IEA](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/international-energy-agency)]{.underline}.
[The economy of many countries is based on oil production and its
trading]{.underline}, [so the price of oil may be one of the key factors
determining a country\'s budget in terms of its revenues.]{.underline}
Also, the oil price is a key factor for the
shipping [[industry]{.underline}](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/industry),
because oil is the [main energy source for the transport of commodities
by sea all over the world, and shipping markets play a role in final
prices for energy]{.underline}, agricultural goods and metals. One of
the most widely used indicators to measure changes in the cost of
transporting raw materials such as metals, grain and [[fossil
fuels]{.underline}](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/fossil-fuel) by
sea, is the Baltic Dry Index (BDI), created by the London-based Baltic
Exchange.[^1^](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544223001731#fn1) [Changes
in the BDI are often seen as one of the main indicators of future
economic growth or contraction]{.underline}, because raw and
pre-production materials which are shipped are typically at low levels
of speculation. Also, the BDI is linked to oil price fluctuations, and
both are dependent on global economic and business conditions. In fact,
oil use for longer-distance freight and shipping varies according to the
outlook for the global economy and [[international
trade]{.underline}](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/international-trade),
which is also affected by geopolitical factors.

A more serious scenario, [oil supplies could be disrupted, for example
due to attacks on infrastructure or the closure of key transport
routes]{.underline}. In such a case, prices could rise by tens of
percent, for example to over USD 100 per barrel. [Such a development
would put significant pressure on the global economy, where rising
energy costs would trigger a sharp rise in inflation and a deterioration
in the economic outlook]{.underline}. For financial markets, this would
mean increased volatility and [a shift towards safer assets. There is
also a scenario of a rapid diplomatic settlement that would stabilise
the situation and gradually calm the markets]{.underline}. The price of
oil could then fall back to around USD 70 per barrel or even lower,
especially [if supply from other parts of the world, such as the US or
Africa, increased at the same time. In this case]{.underline}, the
negative impact on economies would be limited [and inflation would
probably remain under control.]{.underline}

feel dissatisfied or hopeless. Targeting prominent Saudi businessmen for
corruption, shrinking the entitlements of the royal family, imprisoning
fundamentalist clerics, and diminishing the religious police have all
earned the crown prince some support. Yet MBS has also cracked down on
members of what should be his natural constituency: Saudi liberals,
including Khashoggi and the women's rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul.
This could backfire. "A social and economic reformation on overdrive is
at too high a risk of failure without the parallel legal and procedural
transformation occurring at the same pace and intensity," warned
Mohammed al-Yahya, a senior Saudi Foreign Ministry official and friend
of Khashoggi, after Khashoggi's killing.

The murder of the journalist no longer looms large inside Saudi Arabia.
But it continues to taint MBS's reputation in the West. Externally, his
most vociferous critics, much like those of the shah, are Western
liberals, many of whom liken him to the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.
In 2020, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent, even said that
Saudi Arabia's leaders were "murderous thugs" and that the regime was
"one of the very most dangerous countries on the face of this earth."
Inside Saudi Arabia, however, the group more likely to eventually
challenge MBS's authority is not liberals who believe he is
undemocratic, but Islamists who believe he is far too liberal. As the
author David Rundell wrote, "If a successor government came to power by
the ballot, it would almost certainly be an Islamist populist regime. .
. . If a new government came to power through violence, it would most
likely be a jihadist organization such as ISIS or al-Qaeda."

Although the crown prince is trying to turn the page on Islamic
fundamentalism, he has not been able to eliminate it wholesale. MBS "put
the Wahhabis in a cage," said the Saudi author Ali Shihabi, referring to
the country's ultra-orthodox school of Islam. Yet just as the Taliban
bided their time for two decades in Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia's
Islamists are dormant but not dead. In an interview with The Economist,
one Saudi religious commentator likened Islamist opponents of MBS to
ants building an underground kingdom. "The prince has closed their
mouths," he said, "but he hasn't ended their kingdom."

WHITE ELEPHANTS AND BLACK SWANS

Over the last half century, [the Middle East]{.mark} has consistently
defied the predictions of forecasters. The whims of individual autocrats
and the volatile mix of oil wealth, religion, and **[great-power
politics]{.underline}** have made the region **[[uniquely vulnerable to
black swan events]{.underline}]{.mark}** with global ramifications.
Those events include Iran's 1979 revolution, Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
in 1990, the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States, the
Arab Spring, the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, and the
October 7 attacks in Israel.

In this context, the future of both [Vision 2030]{.mark} and Vision 1979
[will hinge on]{.mark} the fate of Saudi Arabia's and Iran's leaders and
the **[[global]{.mark} energy [demands]{.mark} that sustain their
ambitions]{.underline}**. [Should MBS's]{.mark} grand [projects
become]{.mark} **[[white elephants]{.underline}]{.mark}**---costly,
unproductive endeavors---or should [oil prices experience a **[prolonged
decline]{.underline}**]{.mark}, rising public [dissatisfaction]{.mark}
may [compel]{.mark} the Saudi crown prince to prioritize **[[regime
stability]{.underline}]{.mark}** [over]{.mark} transformational
**[[reforms]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Although MBS is young, he is acutely
aware of the occupational hazards that come with absolute rule,
including the unforeseen pressures that **[have brought down autocrats
in the past]{.underline}**. The shah's political downfall stemmed from
myriad forces, but also partly from a terminal cancer diagnosis that he
concealed even from his family, which undoubtedly impaired his
decision-making during crises.

In Iran, meanwhile, the future of the Islamic Republic and Vision 1979
remains uncertain beyond the lifespan of the 85-year-old Khamenei.
Although there is a possibility that power may transfer smoothly to
loyal clerics and military leaders committed to revolutionary ideals,
there is also a chance of a shift toward a leadership that prioritizes
Iran's national and economic interests over its revolutionary doctrine.
Efforts by some supporters of Mojtaba Khamenei, Khamenei's 55-year-old
son and potential successor, to compare him to Iran's MBS are risible.
But they suggest that even Tehran's younger-generation revolutionaries
recognize that a forward-looking vision is more appealing than a
backward-looking one.

The success or [failure]{.mark} of these competing visions **[[will
have]{.mark} broad [global ramifications]{.mark}]{.underline}**. A world
in which Vision 2030 fails **[dramatically]{.underline}**,
[leaving]{.mark} the vast [energy resources]{.mark} of both Saudi Arabia
and Iran **[[under the control of]{.mark} Sunni and Shiite
[extremists,]{.mark}]{.underline}** [would make the Middle East]{.mark}
and the global economy [less]{.mark} prosperous and [stable]{.mark}.
Conversely, if Iran's post-Khamenei leadership prioritizes the economic
welfare and security of its people, Iran has the potential to one day
become a G-20 nation and a pillar of global stability.

The failed American experiments in Afghanistan and Iraq, coupled with
the failures of the Arab Spring, have largely dispelled illusions among
U.S. officials that Washington has the capacity to meaningfully shape,
at least in a positive way, the politics of the Middle East. It will be
local actors who determine which visions prevail. But given that [Vision
2030]{.mark} seeks to [uphold the]{.mark} U.S.-led **[[liberal world
order]{.underline}]{.mark}** and Vision 1979 seeks to defeat it, the
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates has a vested interest
in the success of the former and the failure of the latter. It is also
in the global economic interest to see stable, [prosperous]{.mark}
governments in [Saudi]{.mark} Arabia [and Iran]{.mark} that **[[are at
peace]{.underline}]{.mark}** with one another and themselves. This means
the world should help the people of Iran move beyond an oppressive
ideological regime that has caused internal stagnation and regional
unrest, and help Saudi Arabia navigate political reforms that will help
sustain its social and economic transformation.

The best outcome for the United States, the Middle East, and the world
is two sustainable, representative, **[forward-looking
visions]{.underline}** in both countries. The worst outcome is two
**[backward-looking regimes clinging to past grievances]{.underline}**.
The former may be difficult to achieve. But [the consequences]{.mark} of
the latter **[[would be]{.mark} nothing short of
[catastrophic]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

#### Escalation risk is unique\-\--Saudi's willingness for reproachment prevents spiraling conflicts.

ready to explode".

Because Saudi Arabia and Iran back different sides in this conflict, any
**[[further escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}** [could]{.mark} also
[derail further]{.mark} China-brokered
**[[rapprochement]{.underline}]{.mark}** between these two regional
rivals.

[This]{.mark}, in turn, also [decreases the likelihood of a
**[sustainable solution]{.underline}** for]{.mark} the crisis in
[Gaza]{.mark}. Hamas receives most of its backing from Iran and Qatar
and is also able to fund-raise in Qatar itself.

In contrast, most other Arab states are keen to see Hamas defeated in
Gaza, regardless of their support for the Palestinian cause.

This hostility towards Iranian proxies is even more obvious in the case
of Hezbollah: With both the political and military wings Hezbollah
banned by all the members of the Gulf Co-operation Council and most
other Arab countries in North Africa, there should be no illusion about
the fact that Hezbollah is seen as a threat by rulers across the Arab
world - a perception that extends to Iran as the main sponsor of Hamas,
Hezbollah and a range of other terrorist groups.

Amid these complex calculations by political leaders across the Middle
East and beyond, Palestinian suffering in Gaza continues at an
unprecedented level.

With Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu again explicitly ruling
out the creation of Palestinian state, a pathway towards a settlement
that could be broadly supported across the region and at the UN, is
nowhere in sight. Netanyahu's dangerous stance also, and perhaps
fatally, undermines prospects for the [rapprochement between
Saudi]{.mark} Arabia [and Israel]{.mark} that [**[would be critical for
sustainable peace in the Middle East]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

With the Israel-Hamas war unlikely to end soon, let alone any prospects
of a sustainable solution to the wider Arab-Israeli and
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, **[[the risk of escalation is likely to
remain high and turn into reality]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- if not by
design, [then by miscalculation as the]{.mark} **[[multiple
crises]{.underline}]{.mark}** engulfing the Middle East [will eventually
become **[unmanageable]{.underline}** and **[spin out of
control]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

[Jihadi terrorists, unlike state actors, do not seek to maintain a
status quo. They are apocalyptically motivated, seeking to bring about
the conditions for their version of an Islamic caliphate.]{.underline}

[ISIS, al-Qaeda, and aligned groups are motivated by a destructive,
apocalyptic worldview]{.underline}. In a 2007 video, [Osama bin Laden
had promised to use massive weapons to upend the global status quo,
destroy the capitalist hegemony, and help create an Islamic
caliphate]{.underline}, while Saudi cleric Nasir al-Fahd said, "If
Muslims cannot defeat the kafir in a different way, it is permissible to
use weapons of mass destruction, [even if it kills all of them and wipes
them and their descendants off the face of the Earth]{.underline}."

[ISIS aims to weaken and ultimately destroy state actors]{.underline},
including Russia, which they view as an enemy for its role in propping
up the Assad regime in Syria. Furthermore, ISIS has a history of calling
for attacks on Russia, specifically in retaliation for Russia's military
involvement in Syria and its broader fight against Islamist movements in
the North Caucasus. If their leaders or the leaders of al-Qaeda can
exploit a loophole to trigger a large-scale conflict between Russia and
NATO, they might see this as a means to cripple both powers, creating a
vacuum wherein they can establish their Caliphate.

[One of the most disturbing scenarios arises from the possibility of
ISIS orchestrating a false flag conventional weapons attack that manages
to trigger a nuclear response and thus leads to all-out nuclear
war.]{.underline} In today's interconnected global landscape, [terrorist
groups can exploit modern technologies, cyber capabilities, and regional
instability to mislead major powers. A well-executed false flag attack
could deceive both NATO and Russia into believing they are under attack
from the other, prompting a rapid escalation into a nuclear
conflagration.]{.underline}

[ISIS's leaders are not known for long-term survival planning,
especially in the event of a global catastrophe like nuclear war. Their
ideology prioritizes martyrdom and the apocalyptic fulfillment of their
religious vision over practical concerns about survival in a
post-nuclear world.]{.underline} If a NATO-Russia nuclear conflict were
to lead to a nuclear winter---an environmental catastrophe that would
devastate agriculture and global ecosystems---ISIS may believe that
their movement, or at least their ideological successors, would survive
through divine intervention or sheer resilience.

[ISIS's apocalyptic vision and willingness to exploit global chaos makes
them a serious threat to global security]{.underline}, especially in the
context of Russia's current nuclear posture. Russian and NATO forces
must work to enhance intelligence-sharing and establish clearer lines of
communication to avoid falling victim to such a false flag operation.
Furthermore, global powers must consider the broader implications of
lowering nuclear thresholds in an age where non-state actors can exploit
such vulnerabilities. Robust systems for verifying the origins of
attacks, improved missile defense technologies, and clear diplomatic
channels are essential to prevent any false flag attempt from
succeeding.

With the wars in the [Middle East]{.underline} between Israel and Gaza,
Lebanon, Yemen, Syria and now with Iran, the [situation]{.underline} in
that region [is]{.underline} indeed [volatile]{.underline}. However, the
recent reports that [Pakistan]{.underline} has warned the United States
and France of a nuclear response against Israel -- should Iran come
under nuclear attack -- have [made the situation even more perilous, not
just for the region but toward bringing the world close to a **global
catastrophe.**]{.underline} Pakistan's further warning that it would
join Iran in war if any country takes up arms against Tehran [signals a
dangerous expansion of the conflict currently raging in the Middle
East.]{.underline}

2\. The Israeli military campaigns, backed by the U.S. and key Western
allies, has triggered a [counter-alignment led by Iran and supported by
Russia, China and now Pakistan.]{.underline} The world is witnessing the
re-emergence of geopolitical blocs[, reminiscent of alliances that once
plunged humanity into world wars.]{.underline}

3\. As a historian, one sees the unfolding scene with serious
trepidation as it is reminiscent of past catastrophes. From the Thirty
Years' War of the 17th century to the First and Second World Wars, and
the Cold War, [history is replete with warnings: localized conflicts, if
unchecked, can rapidly escalate into **global disasters** when entangled
in rigid alliances and ideological fervor. But unlike the previous wars
without weapons of total extinction, the current situation is simply a
threat to the entire human existence, as the usage of nuclear weapons
can **end human life on earth.**]{.underline}

4\. In the Thirty Years' War of 1618--1648, what began as a dispute
between Catholic and Protestant states in the Holy Roman Empire morphed
into a continent-wide war, drawing in Spain, France, Sweden and others.
The war left much of Central Europe devastated. Its conclusion at the
Peace of Westphalia set the precedent for sovereign equality and
non-intervention, laying the foundation for modern international
diplomacy.

5\. In 1914, a single assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand
triggered a war that spiraled due to rigid military alliances and
nationalist fervor. Germany, Austria-Hungary and Turkey faced off
against Britain, France and Russia in a catastrophic conflict that
resulted in millions of deaths, devastation of Europe, the redrawing of
maps and the collapse of empires. All these due to a web of military
alliances.

6\. ⁠Borne out of the unresolved tensions of WWI and fueled by
ideological extremism and territorial ambition, WWII introduced
mechanized and total warfare on a global scale. The Allied and Axis
blocs fought across Europe, Asia and Africa. The war ended with the
atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and led directly to the Cold
War.

7\. ⁠The Cold War further demonstrated how ideological rivalry and
nuclear brinkmanship could hold the entire world hostage. Although never
erupting into direct conflict between the United States and the Soviet
Union, the Cold War structured global politics around two rival power
blocs. Proxy wars, nuclear brinkmanship and ideological struggles
dominated the era, again demonstrating how systemic rivalry can hold the
world hostage to annihilation.

8\. ⁠These wars all shared a dangerous pattern: [the gradual hardening of
sides, the demonization of opponents, the collapse of diplomacy and
eventually the mass destruction of lives and civilizations.]{.underline}

9\. ⁠Today, Israel's sustained military offensives ostensibly as national
defense, have extended beyond Gaza to Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and
now to direct confrontations with Iran. Backed diplomatically,
financially and militarily by the United States and European allies,
Israel continues to act with impunity.

10\. ⁠Meanwhile, Iran is no longer isolated. It has gained the firm
backing of Russia and China, two global powers already in strategic
competition with the West. [Pakistan's open threat to use nuclear
weapons on Israel if nuclear attack is carried against Iran marks a
dramatic escalation and a point of no return should such threats
materialize.]{.underline}

11\. ⁠The contours of a new global alignment are rapidly taking shape,
and [the stakes could not be higher]{.underline}. Given the dire
situation, African responsibility is to engender peace. Certainly Africa
has long been the theater of proxy wars, yet it has also been a symbol
of resilience, neutrality and moral clarity. In this looming global
crisis, Africa must no longer be a silent bystander. It must act as a
diplomatic stabilizer and voice of reason.

Some of [the]{.underline} same [factors that made the
**Mid**]{.underline}dle [**East** fertile ground for foreign involvement
during the Cold War]{.underline} and since the 2011 Arab Spring
**[persist today]{.underline}**. [Political [factors]{.mark} that
produce conflicts of the sort [that draw in **external
powers**]{.mark}]{.underline} were historically, and
**[[remain]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[manifold]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Middle Eastern [conflicts that have drawn **external
involvement**]{.underline} have [often manifested in]{.underline}
institutionally weak [countries that experienced sudden changes in
**governance** or **popular uprisings**]{.underline}. [[As
**regimes**]{.underline}]{.mark} or institutions
**[[fracture]{.underline}]{.mark}**, competing [external [powers
perceive opportunities]{.mark} to exploit turbulent conditions [to
**increase their influence**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For instance, in
North Yemen in 1962, army officers deposed the country's monarch and
sought to establish a military-led government akin to Nasser's Egypt,
and Egypt eventually deployed troops in support of the Yemeni
putschists.39 And in the more recent era, [[the **Arab Spring**]{.mark}
fomented instability that [led to **external involvement** in
Syria]{.mark}, Yemen, [and Libya]{.mark}]{.underline},40 which in turn
instigated civil wars in these countries.41 As we discuss later, weak
institutions and state fragility remain pressing concerns in the region
and portend continued instability. Moreover,
**[[fractured]{.underline}]{.mark}** identity [[**politics**
in]{.underline}]{.mark} Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and several of [[the
**Gulf states**]{.mark} create vectors for **foreign**]{.underline}
penetration and **[exploitation]{.underline}**, which further
exacerbates instability. [Future **waves of instability**]{.underline}
and social upheavals [[could]{.mark} again [lead to]{.mark}]{.underline}
popular **[revolutions]{.underline}**, **[[regime
change]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[or **civil war**]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[which]{.mark} [present opportunities for **foreign**]{.mark}
**meddling**]{.underline}, whether [through]{.underline} supporting
proxies or **[[intervening]{.mark} directly]{.underline}** in a
conflict.

In addition to having such opportunities, [competing powers]{.underline}
may [**have** motivations to **continue** the **history of
entanglement**]{.underline} in regional conflicts. The three powers have
interests in the region (as noted earlier), and [[competition among the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates,
**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and **Russia** is **intensifying**
and could]{.mark} **again [motivate support]{.mark}** [to
parties]{.mark}]{.underline} in conflicts. Indeed, the Middle East hosts
what is probably the most serious current conflict in which numerous
external powers back local actors: the Syrian civil war. After the civil
war began following Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad's brutal crackdown
on protests during the Arab Spring in 2011, the United States---along
with its allies---backed what it considered "moderate" opposition
forces.42 Russia, on the other hand, backed the Assad government, and
its support escalated into a direct military intervention in 2015. Ten
years in, the conflict had left 387,000 dead and some 205,000 missing.43

[A **Third Gulf War** would **distinguish** itself from **recent Middle
Eastern conflicts** by the **geographic span** of the fighting and the
**number of major actors** that might become involved]{.underline}. In
all likelihood, [the field of battle would stretch from the shores of
the Mediterranean]{.underline}, [where **Lebanon** abuts **Israel**, to
the **Strait of Hormuz**, where the **Persian Gulf**
empties]{.underline} into [the **Indian Ocean**]{.underline}.
[Participants could include]{.underline}, on one side,
**[Iran]{.underline}**, the regime of Bashar al-Assad in
**[Syria]{.underline}**, [**[Hezbollah]{.underline}**](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-10814698) in
Lebanon, and assorted [Shia militias in **Iraq** and
**Yemen**]{.underline}; and, on the other, [**Israel**, **Saudi
Arabia**, the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, [and
the]{.underline} United Arab Emirates (**[UAE]{.underline}**).  If the
fighting in Syria were to get out of hand, **[Russian]{.underline}**
forces [could]{.underline} even [become involved.]{.underline}

[All of these forces have been equipping themselves with **massive
arrays** of **modern weaponry**]{.underline} in recent years, [ensuring
that any fighting will be **intense**, bloody, and **horrifically
destructive**]{.underline}. Iran has been acquiring an assortment of
modern weapons [from
Russia](https://thediplomat.com/2016/11/iran-and-russia-negotiating-10-billion-arms-deal/) and
possesses its own substantial arms industry. It, in turn, has
been [supplying](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-crisis-iran/exclusive-iran-steps-up-weapons-lifeline-to-assad-idUSBRE92D05U20130314) the
Assad regime with modern arms and is suspected
of [shipping](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/03/world/middleeast/hezbollah-is-said-to-transfer-missiles.html) an
array of missiles and other munitions to Hezbollah. Israel, Saudi
Arabia, and the UAE have long been [major
recipients](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/R44716.pdf) of tens of
billions of dollars of sophisticated American weaponry and President
Trump
has [promised](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/20/us-saudi-arabia-seal-weapons-deal-worth-nearly-110-billion-as-trump-begins-visit.html) to
supply them with so much more.

This means that, once ignited, [a Third Gulf War could
**quickly [escalate](http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/what-war-between-iran-america-would-actually-look-22716)** and
would]{.underline} undoubtedly [generate large numbers of]{.underline}
civilian and military [casualties]{.underline}, [and **new flows of
refugees**]{.underline}. The United States and its allies would try to
quickly cripple Iran's war-making capabilities, a task that would
require multiple waves of air and missile strikes, some surely directed
at facilities in densely populated areas. Iran and its allies would seek
to respond by attacking high-value targets in Israel and Saudi Arabia,
including cities and oil facilities. Iran's Shia allies in Iraq, Yemen,
and elsewhere could be expected to launch [attacks of their
own](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/12/21/what-would-a-saudi-iran-war-look-like-dont-look-now-but-it-is-already-here-4/) on
the U.S.-led alliance. [Where all this would lead]{.underline}, once
such fighting began, [is]{.underline} of course **[impossible to
predict]{.underline}**, [but]{.underline} the **[history]{.underline}**
of the twenty-first century [suggests that]{.underline}, whatever
happens, [it won't follow]{.underline} the [**carefully laid plans** of
commanding generals]{.underline} (or their civilian overseers) [and
won't end]{.underline} either [expectably or well]{.underline}.

Precisely what kind of incident or series of events would ignite a war
of this sort is similarly unpredictable.  Nonetheless, it seems obvious
that [the world is moving ever closer to a moment when the
right]{.underline} (or perhaps the better word is wrong) [**spark**
could set off a **chain of events** leading to **full-scale
hostilities** in the Middle East]{.underline} in the wake of President
Trump's recent rejection of the nuclear deal. It's possible, for
instance, to imagine a clash between Israeli and Iranian military
contingents in Syria sparking such a conflict. The Iranians, it is
claimed, have set up bases there both to support the Assad regime and to
funnel arms to Hezbollah in Lebanon. On May 10th, Israeli
jets [struck](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/world/middleeast/israel-iran-syria-military.html) several
such sites, following a missile barrage on the Israeli-occupied Golan
Heights said to have been launched by Iranian soldiers in Syria. More
Israeli strikes certainly lie in our future as Iran presses its drive
to [establish](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/08/iran-iraq-syria-isis-land-corridor) and
control a so-called land bridge through Iraq and Syria to Lebanon.
Another possible spark could involve collisions or other incidents
between American and Iranian naval vessels in the Persian Gulf, where
the two navies
frequently [approach](https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/25/politics/navy-ship-iran-arabian-gulf/index.html) each
other in an aggressive manner. [Whatever the nature of the initial
clash, **rapid escalation** to **full-scale hostilities** could occur
with **very little warning**]{.underline}.

All of this begs a question: Why are the United States and its allies in
the region moving ever closer to another major war in the Persian Gulf?
Why now?

The Geopolitical Impulse

[The **first two Gulf Wars** were driven]{.underline}, to a large
extent, [by the [**geopolitics of
oil**](https://www.amazon.com/Blood-Oil-Consequences-Dependency-Petroleum/dp/0805079386)]{.underline}.
After World War II, as the United States became increasingly dependent
on imported sources of petroleum, it drew ever closer to Saudi Arabia,
the world's leading oil producer. Under the [Carter
Doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Doctrine) of January
1980, the U.S. pledged for the first time to use force, if necessary, to
prevent any interruption in the flow of oil from Saudi Arabia and other
Gulf states to this country and its allies. Ronald Reagan, the first
president to implement that doctrine, authorized the
\"[reflagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Earnest_Will)\"
of Saudi and Kuwaiti oil tankers with the stars and stripes during the
eight-year Iran-Iraq War that began in 1980 and their protection by the
U.S. Navy. When Iranian gunboats menaced such tankers, American vessels
drove them off in incidents that represented the first actual military
clashes between the U.S. and Iran. At the time, President Reagan put the
matter in [no uncertain
terms](http://articles.latimes.com/1987-05-30/news/mn-3564_1_persian-gulf):
"The use of the sea lanes of the Persian Gulf will not be dictated by
the Iranians."

Oil geopolitics also figured prominently in the U.S. decision to
intervene in the [First Gulf
War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War). When Iraqi forces occupied
Kuwait in August 1990 and appeared poised to invade Saudi Arabia,
President George H.W. Bush announced that the U.S. would send forces to
defend the kingdom and so played out the Carter Doctrine in real time.
"Our country now imports nearly half the oil it consumes and could face
a major threat to its economic independence,"
he [declared](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=18750),
adding that "the sovereign independence of Saudi Arabia is of vital
interest to the United States."

Although the oil dimension of U.S. strategy was less obvious in
President George W. Bush's decision to invade Iraq in March 2003, it was
still there. Members of his inner circle, especially Vice President Dick
Cheney, [argued](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/27/world/eyes-iraq-cheney-s-words-administration-case-for-removing-saddam-hussein.html) that
Iraqi ruler Saddam Hussein posed a threat to the safety of Persian Gulf
oil lanes and needed to be eliminated. Others in the administration
were [eager to
pursue](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2014/mar/20/iraq-war-oil-resources-energy-peak-scarcity-economy) the
prospect of privatizing Iraq's state-owned oil fields and turning them
over to American oil companies (a notion that evidently stuck in Donald
Trump's mind, as he
repeatedly [asserted](https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2017/01/21/trump-iraq-should-have-kept-oil/SwZlr5SwQeG5AkYf4NZelK/story.html) during
the 2016 election campaign that "we should have kept the oil").

Today, oil has receded, if not entirely disappeared, as a major factor
in Persian Gulf geopolitics, while other issues have moved to the fore.
Of greatest significance in animating the current military standoff is
an escalating struggle for regional
dominance [between](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-42008809) Iran
and Saudi Arabia (with a nuclear-armed Israel lurking in the wings).
Both countries view themselves as the hub of a network of like-minded
states and societies \-- Iran as the leader of the region's Shia
populations, Saudi Arabia of its Sunnis \-- and both resent any gains by
the other. To complicate matters, President Trump, clearly harboring
deep antipathy toward the Iranians, has chosen to side with the Saudis
big league (as he might say), while Benjamin Netanyahu's Israel, fearing
Iranian advances in the region,
has [opted](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-behravesh-iran-commentary/commentary-the-unlikely-mideast-alliance-that-threatens-iran-idUSKBN1FC358) to
weigh in on the Saudi side of the equation in a major way as well. The
result,
as [suggested](https://usa.spectator.co.uk/2018/05/america-goes-rogue/) by
military historian Andrew Bacevich, is the "inauguration of a
Saudi-American-Israeli axis" and a "major realignment of U.S. strategic
relationships."

Several key factors explain this transition from an oil-centric strategy
emphasizing military power to a more conventional struggle among
regional rivals that has already deeply embroiled the planet's last
superpower. To begin with, America's reliance on imported oil has
diminished rapidly in recent years, thanks to an oil drilling revolution
in the U.S. that has allowed the massive exploitation of domestic shale
reserves through the process of fracking. As a result, access to Persian
Gulf supplies matters far less in Washington than it did in previous
decades. In 2001, [according
to](https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/en/corporate/pdf/energy-economics/statistical-review-2017/bp-statistical-review-of-world-energy-2017-full-report.pdf) oil
giant BP, the United States relied on imports for 61% of its net oil
consumption; by 2016, that share had dropped to 37% and was still
falling \-- and yet the U.S. remains deeply involved in the region as a
decade and a half of unending war, counterinsurgency, drone strikes, and
other kinds of strife sadly indicate.

By invading and occupying Iraq in 2003, Washington also eliminated a
major bulwark of Sunni power, a country led by Saddam Hussein who, two
decades earlier, had been [siding
with](http://www.famouspictures.org/donald-rumsfeld-shakes-hands-with-saddam-hussein/) the
U.S. in opposing Iran. That invasion, ironically enough, had the effect
of expanding Shiite influence and making Iran the major \-- possibly the
only \-- winner in the years of war that followed. Some Western
analysts [believe](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/how-the-iraq-war-has-empowered-iran/) that
the greatest tragedy of the invasion, from a geopolitical point of view,
was the ascension of Shiite politicians with close ties to Tehran in
post-Hussein Iraq. Although that country's current leaders appear intent
on pursuing a path of their own in the post-ISIS moment, many powerful
Iraqi Shiite militias \-- including some that played key roles in
driving Islamic State militants out of Mosul and other major cities
\-- [retain close
ties](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/15/world/middleeast/iran-iraq-iranian-power.html) to
Iran's Revolutionary Guards.

While disasters in themselves, the wars in Syria and Yemen have only
added additional complexity to the geopolitical chessboard on which
Washington found itself after that invasion and from which it has never
extricated itself. In Syria, Iran has chosen to ally with Vladimir
Putin's Russia to preserve the brutal Assad
regime, [providing](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/04/25/politics/iran-shipments-syria/index.html) it
with arms, funds, and an unknown number of advisers from the
Revolutionary Guards. Hezbollah, a Shiite political group in Lebanon
with a significant military wing,
has [sent](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-aleppo-fall-insi/hezbollah-other-shiite-allies-helped-assad-win-in-aleppo-idUSKBN1431PV) large
numbers of its own fighters to Syria to help Assad's forces. In Yemen,
the Iranians are believed to
be [providing](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-iran-houthis/exclusive-iran-steps-up-support-for-houthis-in-yemens-war-sources-idUSKBN16S22R) arms
and [missile
technology](https://www.defenseone.com/politics/2018/05/after-iran-deal-heres-what-us-military-worried-about-next/148062/) to
the Houthis, a homegrown Shiite rebel group that now controls the
northern half of the country, including the capital, Sana'a.

The Saudis, in turn, have been playing an ever more active role in
bolstering their military power and protecting embattled Sunni
communities throughout the region. Seeking to resist and reverse what
they view as Iranian advances, they have [helped
arm](http://foreignpolicy.com/2012/02/27/saudi-arabia-is-arming-the-syrian-opposition/)militias
of an extreme sort and evidently even al-Qaeda-associated groups under
attack from Iranian-backed Shiite forces in Iraq and Syria. In 2015, in
the case of Yemen,
they [organized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabian-led_intervention_in_Yemen) a

and [weddings](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/saudi-coalition-kills-33-at-a-yemeni-wedding-party/).
This combination has helped produce an

deaths and a singular humanitarian crisis in that already impoverished
country.

In response to these developments, the Obama administration sought to
calm the situation by negotiating a nuclear deal with the Iranians and
by [holding
out](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/us/politics/trump-iran-nuclear-deal-news-analysis-.html) the
promise of increased economic ties with the West in return for reduced
assertiveness outside its borders. Such a strategy never, however, won
the support of Israel or Saudi Arabia. And in the Obamayears, Washington
continued to support both of those countries in a major way, including
supplying massive amounts of military
equipment, [refueling](http://www.pogo.org/blog/2018/03/pentagon-to-congress-you-cant-stop-us-from-fueling-saudi-arabias-war-in-yemen.html) Saudi
planes in midair so they could strike deeper into Yemen, and providing
the Saudis with [targeting
intelligence](https://www.csis.org/analysis/us-support-saudi-military-operations-yemen) for
their disastrous war.

The Anti-Iranian Triumvirate

All of these regional developments, in play before Donald Trump was
elected, have only gained added momentum since then, thanks in no small
degree to the pivotal personalities involved.

The first of them, of course, is President Trump. Throughout his
election campaign, he regularly denounced the nuclear deal that Iran,
the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China, and the European
Union all signed onto in July 2015. Officially known as the [Joint
Comprehensive Plan of
Action](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/JCPOA-at-a-glance) (JCPOA),
the agreement forced Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment program in
return for the lifting of all nuclear-related sanctions. It was a plan
that Iran scrupulously adhered to. Although President Obama, many senior
American policymakers, and most European leaders had argued that the
JCPOA \-- whatever its flaws \-- provided a valuable constraint on
Iran's nuclear (and so other) ambitions, Trump consistently denounced it
as a "terrible deal" because it failed to eliminate every last vestige
of the Iranian nuclear infrastructure or ban that country's missile
program. "This deal was a disaster,"
he [told](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/us/politics/donald-trump-transcript.html) David
Sanger of the New York Times in March 2016.

While Trump, who has filled his administration with Iranophobes,
including his new secretary of state and new national security adviser,
seems to harbor a primeval animosity toward the Iranians, perhaps
because they don't treat him with the adoration he feels he deserves, he
has a soft spot for the Saudi royals, [who
do](http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/176421/). In May 2017, on his first
trip abroad as president, he traveled to Riyadh, where
he [performed](https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/20/politics/trump-saudi-arabia-dance/index.html) a
sword dance with Saudi princes and immersed himself in the sort of
ostentatious displays of wealth only oil potentates can provide.

While in Riyadh,
he [conferred](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/21/world/middleeast/trump-saudi-arabia-mohammed-bin-salman.html) at
length with then-Deputy Crown Prince [Mohammed bin
Salman](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-40354415), the
31-year-old son of King Salman and a key architect of Saudi Arabia's
geopolitical contest with the Iranians. Prince Mohammed, who serves as
the Saudi defense minister and was named crown prince in June 2017, is
the [prime
mover](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/saudi-military-leaders-replaced-amid-stalemated-war-yemen-n851461) behind
the kingdom's (so far unsuccessful) drive to crush the Houthi rebels in
Yemen and
is [known](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/04/mohammed-bin-salman-iran-israel/557036/) to
harbor fierce anti-Iranian views.

At an earlier [White House
luncheon](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/14/world/middleeast/mohammed-bin-salman-saudi-arabia-trump.html) in
March 2017, bin Salman, or MBS as he's sometimes known, and President
Trump seemed to reach an implicit agreement on a [common
strategy](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/21/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-iran-donald-trump.html) for
branding Iran a regional threat, tearing up the nuclear agreement, and
so setting the stage for an eventual war to vanquish that country or at
least to fell the regime that runs it. While in Riyadh, President
Trump [told](https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/21/politics/trump-saudi-speech-transcript/index.html) a
conference of Sunni Arab leaders that, "from Lebanon to Iraq to Yemen,
Iran funds, arms, and trains terrorists, militias, and other extremist
groups that spread destruction and chaos across the region. It is a
government that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing the destruction of
Israel, death of America, and ruin for many leaders and nations in this
very room."

While no doubt gratifying to the Saudis, Emiratis, Kuwaitis, and other
Sunni rulers listening, those words echoed the views of the third key
player in the strategic triumvirate that may soon drive the region into
all-out war, Israeli Prime Minister [Benjamin
Netanyahu](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/benjamin-netanyahu),
also known as "Bibi." For years, he
has [railed](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/world/middleeast/netanyahu-israel-iran-nuclear.html) against
Iranian ambitions in the region and threatened military action against
any Iranian move that would, as he saw it, impinge on Israeli security.
Now, in Trump and the Saudi Crown Prince, he has the allies of his
dreams. In the Obama years, Netanyahu was a fierce opponent of the
Iranian nuclear deal and used a rare appearance before a joint session
of Congress in March 2015 to denounce it in no uncertain terms. He has
never \-- [right up
to](http://time.com/5262607/netanyahu-trump-iran-deal-speech/) the days
before Trump withdrew from the accord \-- stopped working to persuade
the president that the agreement should be junked and Iran targeted.

In that 2015 speech to Congress, Netanyahu laid out a vision of Iran as
a systemic danger that would later be appropriated by Trump and his
Saudi confederates in Riyadh. "Iran\'s regime poses a grave threat, not
only to Israel, but also the peace of the entire world,"
he [asserted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/03/03/full-text-netanyahus-address-to-congress/?utm_term=.fd99a7429ef1) in
a typically hyperbolic statement. "Backed by Iran, Assad is slaughtering
Syrians. Backed by Iran, Shiite militias are rampaging through Iraq.
Backed by Iran, Houthis are seizing control of Yemen, threatening the
strategic strait at the mouth of the Red Sea. Along with the Straits of
Hormuz, that would give Iran a second choke-point on the world's oil
supply."

Now, [Netanyahu is playing a major role in driving the]{.underline}
already crippled [region into a war that could]{.underline} further
destroy it, [produce]{.underline} yet [more **terror**]{.underline}
groups (and terrorized civilians), [and create **havoc** on
a]{.underline} potentially **[global scale]{.underline}**,
[given]{.underline} that both [**Russia** and **China**]{.underline}
back the Iranians.

Girding for War

Pay attention to the words of Netanyahu in Washington and Donald Trump
in Riyadh. [Think of them]{.underline} not as political rhetoric, but
[as **prophesies** of a grim kind]{.underline}. You're going to be
hearing a lot more such prophesies in the months ahead as the United
States, Israel, and Saudi Arabia move closer to war with Iran and its
allies. While ideology and religion will play a part in what follows,
[the underlying impetus is a **geopolitical struggle for
control**]{.underline} of the greater Persian Gulf region, [with **all
its riches**]{.underline}, between two sets of countries, each
determined to prevail.

No one can say with certainty when, or even if, these powerful forces
will produce a devastating new war or set of wars in the Middle East.
Other considerations \-- an unexpected flare-up on the Korean Peninsula
if President Trump's talks with North Korea's Kim Jong-un end in
failure, a fresh crisis with Russia, a global economic meltdown \--
could turn attention elsewhere, lessening the importance of the
geopolitical contest in the Persian Gulf. New leadership in any of the
key countries could similarly lead to a change of course. Netanyahu, for
example, is now at risk of losing power because of an ongoing Israeli
police investigation into allegedly corrupt acts of his, and Trump,
well, who can say? Without such a development or developments, however,
[the way to war]{.underline}, [which will]{.underline} surely prove to
[be the **road to hell**]{.underline}, [seems open with a **Third Gulf
War** **looming on humanity's horizon**]{.underline}.

#### Klare says massive waves of refugees which risk [multiple forms of conflict]{.underline} that all [escalate]{.underline} to [great power war]{.underline}

TITLE: [[**Migration** Will **Drive**]{.mark} the]{.underline}
[[Next]{.underline}]{.mark} Wave of **[[World
War]{.underline}]{.mark}**s

Today, not only does war continue to cause mass migration, but
[migration can itself become a **cause of war**]{.underline}.

[MASS [MIGRATION]{.mark}]{.underline}, on the sustained and massive
scale that western Europe continues to experience, [**[creates
tensions]{.mark}** not only [**within states** but]{.mark} also
**[between them]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [These
[tensions]{.mark}]{.underline} will sometimes [[**erupt** into]{.mark}
**open [conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}; already [a new age of
**"Migration Wars"** has begun]{.underline}.

This represents a curious inversion. Across the centuries, war has been
a major, and often the main, driving force behind mass migration. Most
obviously, an indeterminable number of civilians was forced to flee the
fighting that raged in Europe and elsewhere during the Second World War,
while the ongoing civil war in Syria has created perhaps 5.3 million
refugees, in addition to many others who are "internally displaced."
Today, however, not only does war continue to cause mass migration, but
it can itself become a cause of war.

This is the case because of the sheer scale of the current migrant
crisis. The [UNHCR
estimates](http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/figures-at-a-glance.html) that
there are around 65.6 million "forcibly displaced" people in the world.
Most of these are internally displaced within their own countries, but
around 22.5 million are refugees from their native lands. Huge numbers
of people have fled from countries ("of departure"), notably Syria, to
start new lives in the West, risking their lives by undertaking often
extremely hazardous journeys across the Mediterranean or overland
through countries ("of transit") such as Turkey and Greece: in the first
seven months of 2017 alone, 115,109 migrants succeeded in crossing the
Mediterranean. And the total number of asylum applications to western
Europe jumped considerably in 2014--15, from 0.6 million to 1.4 million,
falling slightly to 1.3 million in 2016, while many other migrants,
unquantifiable in number, have illicitly reached Western territory
without formally requesting asylum.

Parts of the world besides western Europe are also affected: since
August 2017, for example, around half a million Rohingya people have
fled violence and persecution in their native Myanmar for the relative
sanctuary of neighboring states, notably Bangladesh, Thailand, Indonesia
and Malaysia. Above all, in sub-Saharan Africa millions are fleeing
poverty from the landlocked states of the Sahel and heading for the
relative prosperity of West Africa: around one fifth of Côte d'Ivoire's
population, for example, comprises people who were born elsewhere.

The sheer vastness of this contemporary refugee crisis does not
represent any increase in the number of wars and conflicts, although it
is arguable that, because of the proliferation of small arms in recent
decades, this is one cause: in a speech in 2000, for example, UN
secretary-general [Kofi Annan
warned](http://www.un.org/events/smallarms2006/pdf/backgrounder.pdf) that
the bloodshed created by small arms and light weapons meant that "they
could well be described as 'weapons of mass destruction.'" But more
important is the proliferation of economic migration, as increasing
numbers flee poverty at home. The causes of this may be varied---some
blame overpopulation, or the destructive impact of climate change upon
food sources---but one driving force is the heightened awareness that
many refugees have. Because of images broadcast on satellite television,
mobile phones and the internet, they are aware, in a way earlier
generations were not, of the relative material comfort the developed
world can offer. This is probably the reason why some relatively
affluent African countries, such as Senegal, also have high outflows of
migrants.

Another difference lies in the proliferation of criminal gangs that, in
return for exploitative fees, organize and finance their journeys. Such
trafficking gangs are prevalent in two major hubs of migrant movement:
Thailand, which is a transit point for Rohingya refugees, and Libya.

Whatever the causes, this major movement of people has now acquired its
own momentum. Because so many refugees have reached the shores and
borders of, in particular, western Europe, and because so much media
attention has focused on this new phenomenon, an idea has taken hold in
the minds of many people who would never otherwise have contemplated
undertaking the hazardous crossing of the Mediterranean Sea or overland
journey through Central Asia or the Balkans: that it is possible to
start a new life in distant but affluent countries. This has been
accentuated by the decision of the German government, taken in 2015, to
open its borders to around one million refugees. In other words, many of
the millions who have fled to Europe in the past few years have climbed
on a bandwagon, following what they have seen others do rather than what
they have been forced, by adverse circumstance, to undertake. Despite
the determined efforts of Western governments to stop them, there is no
reason they will not continue trying to do so.

SUCH [[A **vast**]{.mark} **migrant [flow]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [or
even]{.underline}]{.mark} [its **mere [threat]{.mark}**]{.underline},
will [[tempt]{.mark} **Western [governments]{.mark}** [to
**intervene**]{.mark} in foreign lands]{.underline}---either countries
of departure or transit countries, such as Libya---[in a bid to curb
those flows]{.underline}. This, of course, is nothing new. One country
always has an interest and motive to intervene in the affairs of another
if it is being affected by a flow of refugees from that country; this
was true, to take [one]{.underline} obvious [example]{.underline}, of
Western involvement in [the Balkan Wars]{.underline} of the early- to
mid-1990s. [But]{.underline} the advent of sustained [mass
migration]{.underline}, from so many different venues and across so many
different routes and borders, [is a new phenomenon that is prompting
changes of **strategic direction**]{.underline} in Western capitals.

[Such **"migration [interventionism]{.mark}"**]{.underline} could of
course be entirely peaceful---such as the provision of foreign aid, for
example, to specific programs and initiatives that are designed to
reduce the level of migration. But it could also [[take more
**ambitious**, **militaristic forms**]{.mark}, such as **troop
deployments**]{.underline} to stabilize foreign countries, or regions
within them, that are experiencing, or could potentially experience, a
significant outflow of population. This would not only reduce or
eliminate any incentive for putative migrants to leave, but also allow
those foreign governments to deport and return existing migrants to a
"safe country": many international and domestic laws (Article 16a of
German Basic Law is an example) prohibit the deportation of a refugee to
a country that is not "safe." However, the legal and practical
difficulties of deporting migrants may mean that "migration
interventionism" will, in the years ahead, be undertaken more as a
preventive exercise---to prevent any possible outflow---than a reactive
one.

[The **emergence** of migration interventionism became
clear]{.underline} at the Munich Security Conference in February 2017,
when the UK defense secretary, Sir Michael Fallon, [justified the
ongoing](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/defence-secretary-afghanistan-more-british-troops-sir-michael-fallon-collapse-deployment-munich-a7589241.html),
if limited, British presence in Afghanistan on the grounds that the
collapse of the country would lead to a massive refugee crisis. "We here
will feel the consequences, very directly," he claimed. "There could be
three to four million young Afghan men sent out by their villages to
migrate westwards, and they are heading here." This was a new
justification for the allied presence in Afghanistan, which had
previously been rationalized on a number of other grounds, varying from
combating terrorists who presented a threat to the West to preventing
the flow of narcotics and establishing democracy and human rights.

It is possible that any future Chinese military intervention in North
Korea, in a bid to resolve the ongoing deadlock surrounding Kim
Jong-un's nuclear provocation, could also become a kind of migration
interventionism. Any conflict between North Korea and the United States,
or perhaps merely heightened risk of such a conflict, would provoke a
huge exodus of North Korean refugees over the northern border,
overwhelming Chinese resources.

Instead of committing their own troops overseas in order to prevent or
reduce migration into their territory, governments can also sponsor
foreign armies to act on their behalf. An example is the G5 Sahel Joint
Force, which the French government, supported by other Western
countries, began to establish in the Sahel in the course of 2017.
Comprising five thousand soldiers drawn from the armies of Burkina Faso,
Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Chad, the force is funded by the EU, whose
leaders regard it partly as an anti-insurgent force, but also as a means
of reducing the flow of migrants. "Our support will be an important
contribution to the efforts to counter terrorism in the Sahel region, as
well as irregular migration from West Africa to Europe," the Danish
minister for foreign affairs, Anders Samuelsen, [has
said](https://reliefweb.int/report/mali/denmark-strengthens-efforts-against-migration-and-terrorism-sahel).
The force is also sanctioned by UN Security Council Resolution
2359, [which
points](https://www.un.org/press/en/2017/sc12881.doc.htm) to the
"serious challenges posed by . . . the smuggling of migrants \[and\]
trafficking in persons" from the Sahel. In the future, such a force
could also guard any Western nationals who are posted on foreign soil in
order to process asylum claims. (It was just such a proposal that the
French president, Emmanuel Macron, appeared to make in the summer of
2017 when he said France could establish processing "hotspots" in
Libya---which, since the overthrow of Muammar el-Qaddafi in 2011, has
been a major departure point for millions of refugees.)

[[Countries]{.mark} that are seeking to stem the migrant
flow]{.underline} into their own territory [[are]{.underline}]{.mark}
also [increasingly **[diverting]{.mark}** their **existing [military
resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}, not just [within]{.underline}
departure [states]{.underline}, [but also outside their
borders]{.underline}. In the summer of 2015, for example, the EU began
EUNAVFOR MED, a naval operation in the Mediterranean Sea that was
intended to end human smuggling from Libya by seizing or destroying some
of the boats that the gangs were using. Under its mandate, this €12
million [operation
involved](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/16/royal-navy-warship-could-target-people-smugglers-in-mediterranean) "boarding,
searching, seizing and diverting" smugglers' boats, and wherever
possible, efforts to "dispose" of those vessels. "[This important
transition]{.underline}," as [an EU official
argued](https://eeas.europa.eu/sites/eeas/files/eunavfor_med_-_mission_31_march_2017_en.pdf),
"will [[enable]{.underline}]{.mark} the EU [naval
[operation]{.mark}]{.underline} against human smugglers and traffickers
in the Mediterranean to conduct boarding, search, seizure [and
**diversion**]{.underline} on the high seas of vessels suspected of
being used for human smuggling or trafficking, within international
law." [Vessels, [drones]{.mark} [and aircraft]{.mark}]{.underline} drawn
from at least ten member states [[formed]{.underline}]{.mark} part of
what the EU's foreign-policy chief, Federica Mogherini, [called
[a]{.underline}](https://www.politico.eu/article/federica-mogherini-warns-new-migrant-refugee-flow-libya-iraq-crisis/)[ **["holistic"
approach]{.mark}** to the migrant crisis]{.underline}.

Such [[operations raise]{.mark} the [**prospect of confrontation** and
**military clashes**]{.mark} between]{.underline} recipient states and
[countries]{.underline} of departure and transit. When the Italian
government sent two patrol ships close to the Libyan coast in August
2017, for example, Gen. Khalifa Haftar, the ruler of a large swath of
Libya, threatened to attack them if they entered Libyan waters to search
and destroy refugee boats: "Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces,
Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, issues orders to the Libyan naval bases in
Tobruk, Benghazi, Ras Lanuf and Tripoli to confront any marine unit that
enters the Libyan waters without the permission of the army," [a
statement](https://www.thenational.ae/world/mena/libyan-army-commander-khalifa-haftar-orders-blocking-of-italian-warships-1.616739) from
the Libyan National Army proclaimed. His warning reflected a growing
popular anger among Libyans against Italian interference in their
domestic affairs.

[Such clashes may be more likely if a foreign government threatens to
**exploit** or **manipulate** a refugee crisis in a **bid to extort
concessions**]{.underline} from other countries toward which those
migrants are likely to head. This appears to have been true of the
Libyan government under the rule of Qaddafi. Addressing a gathering in
Rome in August 2010, Qaddafi had claimed that unless he was given large
sums of money, Europe would experience the "advance of millions of
immigrants" that would transform it into "another Africa." He [had added
that](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-11139345) "tomorrow Europe
might no longer be European and even black as there are millions who
want to come in," and alleged that "we don't know if Europe will remain
an advanced and united continent or if it will be destroyed, as happened
with the barbarian invasions." Demanding a payment of €5 billion to
prevent this from happening, his comments were condemned as
"unacceptable blackmail" by Italian parliamentarians. In the context of
these remarks, it is possible that the Anglo-French attack on Libya in
2011 was the first migration war of the contemporary age: this may
explain why, from the onset of the crisis, in March 2011, the French
president, Nicolas Sarkozy, and the British leader, David Cameron,
sought to oust Qaddafi from power and ignored his offers of peace talks.

Turkey, which is the host of over three million refugees, has made
similar sallies at political blackmail in recent years against the
European Union: in March 2017, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan
threatened to tear up a key migrant deal with the EU, in apparent
retaliation for a ban placed by the German and Dutch governments on
political rallies by his followers living in those countries. Istanbul
had already struck a hard bargain when negotiating the deal, which came
into effect in March 2016, having demanded in return a \$3.3 billion aid
package and new negotiations on its membership in the European Union.
Should other states use similar tactics against more powerful ones in
the future, they may risk provoking armed attack.

BESIDES FOREIGN intervention in countries of departure, or armed clashes
with governments that seek to manipulate migration, the world will
witness other types of migration wars. In particular, foreign powers may
deliberately create, or exacerbate, a refugee crisis in another country
in order to divert the resources of the countries where those refugees
are likely to go. Of course, innocent civilians have always been
deliberately targeted in times of war: during World War Two, the Allied
bombing campaign was designed to undermine German civilians' morale and
shorten the war. However, deliberate attempts to drive civilians out of
a country, in a bid to weaken a third party, have historically been much
less common. Such a scenario is more likely to happen today for the
simple reason that a sustained mass migration of people is already under
way. This means that a government or militia has more opportunities to
manipulate the phenomenon, because it is easier to accentuate any such
movement than to create one; it is also less likely to risk
international condemnation by observers who cannot so easily blame
foreign intervention.

An example is the post-2011 Syrian refugee crisis. In March 2016,
several months after Russia had openly intervened in the conflict on the
side of President Bashar al-Assad, Gen. Philip Breedlove---the Supreme
Allied Commander Europe and head of U.S. European Command---claimed that
Vladimir Putin and Assad had "weaponized" migration through a campaign
of bombardment against civilian centers. Their agenda, he continued, was
to undermine NATO and western Europe: "Together, Russia and the Assad
regime are deliberately weaponizing migration in an attempt to overwhelm
European structures and break European resolve," [General Breedlove
told](https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/16-20_03-01-16.pdf) the
Senate Armed Services Committee. In particular, Russia's indiscriminate
use of weapons, such as barrel bombs, seemed to have "no other purpose"
other than to get civilians "on the road."

It is also likely that the Islamic State (ISIS) has deliberately created
or accentuated the flow of refugees from Iraq and Syria. Its shocking
acts of cruelty, such as the beheading of captives, and the careful
propagation of such images on the Internet, had a clear rationale: to
strike fear into the hearts of civilians and force them to flee. Its
advances during 2014--16 led to the displacement of three million in
Iraq, with far more internally displaced---more than 1.5 million in the
Kurdish region alone.

ISIS calculated that this would not only clear a path for its own foot
soldiers, but also overwhelm the resources of neighboring and perhaps
pro-Western regimes, such as Lebanon and Jordan, while adding to the
flow of refugees into western Europe. In the long term, this would
probably be seen as a way of "Islamizing" the West---increasing the
numerical presence of Muslims---but most obviously, in the short and
medium terms, it was a means of infiltrating Europe with sympathizers:
there have been numerous attacks across Europe, including Paris, Nice,
Manchester, London and Berlin, by ISIS-linked insurgents. And in
December 2016, [Europol published a
report](https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/changes_in_modus_operandi_of_is_in_terrorist_attacks.pdf) that
pointed out another danger: "A real and imminent danger is the
possibility of elements of the \[Sunni Muslim\] Syrian refugee diaspora
becoming vulnerable to radicalization once in Europe and being
specifically targeted by Islamic extremist recruiters," argued the
authors of "Changes in Modus Operandi of Islamic State Revisited."

However, it is also possible that Islamic State had another motive.
Instead of deliberately creating a flow of refugees in order to carry
out attacks or overwhelm its enemies' resources, it may have been trying
to provoke them to undertake a "migration intervention." Its motive for
doing this would have been either to spark a confrontation with other
regional actors or to tie down foreign troops in a protracted insurgency
and steadily drain its resources. For example, if NATO had undertaken a
large-scale deployment into parts of Syria to fight ISIS, then its
presence would have sparked a conflict not just with President Assad but
also with his chief supporter, Russia. Alternatively, NATO troops would
have faced sustained casualties from a protracted insurgency, comparable
to the conflict that they (and the Russians) fought in Afghanistan as
well as the experiences of the United States in Vietnam in the 1960s,
and Israel in Lebanon in the 1990s.

THE ADVENT of sustained [mass [migration]{.mark} could [also trigger
conflict if]{.mark} a country tried to [forcibly return or expel]{.mark}
some]{.underline} or all of its new [arrivals]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline} scenario [is]{.underline}, of course, also [[a recipe
for]{.mark} **civil [unrest]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The migrants
themselves may resist: such violence broke out at Calais in northern
France in the fall of 2016, for example, when the French riot police
forcibly removed thousands of refugees from a camp known as "The
Jungle." However, violence could also break out between neighboring
states, for instance if one tried to drive refugees away from its own
territory onto the soil of the other; or if it closed its own border to
stop a column of refugees crossing its own borders, thereby forcing them
to move into, or remain within, another country.

This scenario is already causing political conflict within the EU, as
the Polish and Hungarian governments continue to resist demands for a
quota of refugees that other member states, notably Italy, Germany and
France, are already hosting. However, [it could [in some circumstances
**spark military confrontation**]{.mark}]{.underline}---for example,
[[between]{.mark} countries that [already]{.mark} have
**[unstable]{.mark}** and **tense [relations]{.mark}**, or even when
countries of destination are severely **overstretched** by the strains
of [coping with]{.mark} a **large [influx of
people]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This nearly happened in **Southeast
Asia** in the]{.underline} late **[1980s]{.underline}**, when a huge
exodus of civilians from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia threatened to
overwhelm neighboring countries---Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand, the
Philippines and Indonesia---which, in return, used naval and police
boats and helicopters to push back refugees away from their coasts. The
prime minister of Malaysia, Mahathir
Mohamad, [admitted](http://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/19/weekinreview/the-world-once-again-vietnamese-are-turned-out-to-sea.html),
"All we are doing is preventing foreign vessels from entering our
waters."

[Another variety of migration wars will break out when
migrants]{.underline} from one country [will be **pursued** and
**persecuted** by **militias**]{.underline}---[or]{.underline} perhaps
by [government forces]{.underline}---[based in their
countries]{.underline} of origin. This may be because, for example,
those soldiers seek to take revenge, or to destroy a political cause
that the refugees are seen to represent. [Such]{.underline} cross-border
[attacks would then **trigger conflict**]{.underline} with the host
country in which those migrants have taken refuge. Such a scenario took
place in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) in the mid-1990s,
as Rwandan troops crossed the border, killing thousands of Hutu refugees
who had fled there. This provoked resistance from the Zairean army,
whose leader was broadly sympathetic to the Hutu cause. More recently,
in September 2017, there were also reports that Myanmar helicopters had
crossed into Bangladeshi airspace in hot pursuit of Rohingya refugees.

But because of the vociferous international condemnation it inevitably
provokes, this type of conflict is only likely to occur in relatively
obscure parts of the world, and at moments when events elsewhere
distract international attention. Otherwise, a more likely outcome is an
intelligence-led war against elements within a refugee population,
comparable to Soviet spies assassinating émigrés during the Cold War.

Tension might also arise if one country demands the repatriation of any
number of its civilians who have fled for the sanctuary of another. Such
tensions are nothing new, and have previously arisen not only between
countries of origin and destination but, on occasion, with third parties
too. After the 1848 revolutions in Europe, for example, the fate of
Hungarian and Polish exiles, whom the Russian government wanted to
extradite from Turkey, became a cause célèbre in Britain. However, such
[**international [tensions]{.mark}** [are]{.mark} likely to [become
**more frequent**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the years ahead
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} may [conceivably **[erupt into
confrontation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The most obvious single example
was the American invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, after the Taliban
regime refused to hand over its "guest," Osama bin Laden.

There may also be occasional circumstances in which mass migration will
prompt states not to fight against each other, but to join forces and
wage a collective war against innocent refugees. During the Rohingya
migrant crisis of August and September 2017, for example, Sheikh
Hasina's secular Awami League government in Bangladesh proposed joint
military operations with Myanmar against Rohingya insurgents. But such a
campaign---where innocents are extremely difficult to distinguish from
militants---could easily spiral into a wider war against all Rohingya
refugees.

Finally, the phenomenon of mass migration may spark armed clashes
between states and activists that act---or claim to act---either on
behalf of migrants or, in some cases, to defend their own homeland from
migrants. In the summer of 2017, for example, a far-right German group,
"Defend Europe," [sent a
vessel](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/defend-europe-finding-patreon-refugee-boats-mediterranean-sea-c-star-migrants-right-wing-ngo-rescue-a7891946.html) into
the Mediterranean to confront refugee boats and send them "back to
Africa." Such clashes, which could also erupt between activists, are of
course not likely to be sustained or large-scale, but could be brief and
bloody. The violence at Calais in 2016 was orchestrated by activists who
confronted the police, while in August 2017 the Libyan authorities
expressly warned ngos that had been helping some refugee boats in
crossing the Mediterranean to steer clear of its territorial waters. The
low-level clashes that could erupt between states and activists are
exemplified by the tension between the French government and Greenpeace
in the 1970s and 1980s over the issue of nuclear testing in the South
Pacific. French warships harassed Greenpeace vessels, and on occasion
used violence: French commandos stormed aboard Vega in 1973, for
example, to seize its equipment and, in a notorious case in July 1985,
used explosives to sink the Rainbow Warrior.

However, such [[**low-level clashes** could]{.mark} also [spark]{.mark}
a **more [serious type of confrontation]{.mark}**]{.underline} if, in
the process, one government is deemed responsible for injuring or
killing foreign nationals. [This would certainly [create]{.mark} very
serious **[political tension]{.mark}**]{.underline}, just as the Rainbow
Warrior incident provoked a loud chorus of excoriation from across the
world, particularly from the two governments that represented the
Dutch-Portuguese activist who was killed in the bombing. Another example
was the tension between Tel Aviv and Ankara that followed Israel's
attack on the "Gaza Peace Flotilla" in May 2010, which led to the deaths
of ten activists. However, [it could in some circumstances also trigger
war]{.underline}, just as in August 1998, the death of eleven Iranian
diplomats in Afghanistan came perilously close to [[sparking]{.mark} a
**[full-scale conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} between Iran and the
Taliban.

The [new [migration]{.mark}]{.underline} phenomenon, in other words, is
not just a humanitarian tragedy, but it also [threatens to
**[destabilize]{.mark}**]{.underline} whole regions of [the world [in
**far-reaching ways**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This means that it is
imperative for every country---in the developing as well as the
developed world---not just to manage the flow of people, but to tackle
the causes of the migration problem at their source. More attention must
focus on the phenomenon's root causes, whether it is attributed to war,
corruption or population growth. The ongoing situation in Myanmar, where
discrimination against Rohingya remains institutionalized, also
illustrates the dangers of injustice. More radical, drastic solutions
will need to be considered. The consequences of inaction will be
profound for all; the new age of migration wars has already begun.

### 2NC ME War = Nuclear

#### Tensions are on the [brink]{.underline} and war goes [nuclear]{.underline}.

Accessed 7-14-2025; RS\]

In a chilling roundtable discussion attended by a diverse array of
scholars, professors and experts from renowned universities, think tanks
and policy institutes, the fragile state of global affairs took centre
stage. With the esteemed Professor Joseph Nye of Harvard University
present, the conversation gravitated towards [[the **Middle
East**]{.underline}]{.mark}, a region that [[has the potential to
**ignite** a **catastrophic nuclear war**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The geopolitical landscape is increasingly defined by the rift between
[**Russia** and **China**]{.underline}, and their alliance, [on one
side]{.underline}, [and the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and **NATO**]{.underline}, on the other. This
[**escalating tension** is **exacerbated** by the mutual threats and
**saber-rattling** across]{.underline} various
[flashpoints]{.underline}, from the Taiwan Strait to the Ukraine
conflict, and from the Korean Peninsula to [the volatile Middle
East]{.underline}.

The rift between the Russia-China alliance and the US-NATO axis has
intensified in recent years, with both sides engaging in a perilous game
of geopolitical brinkmanship. In the Middle East, [this tension
manifests in the **[proxy conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline} and power
struggles playing out, from the war [[in **Syria**]{.underline}]{.mark}
to the turmoil in [**[Libya]{.mark}** and
**[Yemen]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

These regional conflicts have become entangled with the larger strategic
competition between the great powers. [[Russia's intervention in
Syria]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example, was seen as an attempt to
bolster its influence in the region and [challenge the **US-led
order**]{.underline}. Similarly, [[China's
**growing**]{.underline}]{.mark} economic and diplomatic [[ties
with]{.underline}]{.mark} countries like **[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}**
have [raised concerns]{.underline} about its intentions in the Middle
East.

[The Middle East]{.underline}, a powder keg of political, religious and
ideological divisions, [stands as [the most]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[immediate]{.mark}** and [**perilous** threat]{.mark} to **global
stability**]{.underline}. The delicate balance of power in this region,
coupled with [the **[prolif]{.mark}**eration of nuclear
capabilities]{.underline}, [has [created a scenario]{.mark}]{.underline}
where the potential [[for **miscalculation**]{.mark} and unintended
escalation]{.underline} looms large.

The presence of nuclear weapons in the region further heightens the
risks. **[[Israel]{.underline}]{.mark}**, widely believed to [[possess a
**sizeable nuclear arsenal**]{.underline}]{.mark}, has long been a
source of concern for its neighbours. The [ongoing [tensions between
**Iran** and the **West**]{.mark} over Tehran's nuclear
program]{.underline} have also raised the specter of a potential nuclear
confrontation.

Furthermore, the unresolved disputes between [**[India]{.mark}** and
**[Pakistan]{.mark}**]{.underline}, both nuclear-armed states, and the
precarious situation on [[the **Korean Peninsula**]{.underline}]{.mark},
where North Korea's nuclear ambitions pose a threat to South Korea and
Japan, [[create]{.mark} a complex web of **[nuclear
flashpoints]{.mark}** that could ignite a **larger
conflagration**]{.underline}.

In this volatile environment, [the **[potential]{.mark}**]{.underline}
**[[for miscalc]{.underline}]{.mark}**ulation and unintended escalation
[[is **extremely high**]{.underline}]{.mark}. A single mistake or
misjudgement by any of the involved parties could trigger a chain
reaction leading to a nuclear exchange. The fragile balance of
deterrence that has held for decades is now under immense strain, as the
risk of miscommunication and miscalculation increases.

The numbers alone are staggering. The United States, Russia and China
possess the lion's share of the world's nuclear stockpile, with the US
and Russia maintaining over 5,000 nuclear warheads each, and China's
arsenal estimated to be in the hundreds. The volatile situation on the
Korean Peninsula, with North Korea's growing nuclear capabilities,
further compounds the risk, as the fragile deterrence between North and
South Korea, and Japan, hangs by a thread.

In this precarious geopolitical landscape, [the role of **leadership**
and **diplomacy** becomes **paramount**]{.underline}. The
[nations]{.underline} involved [must navigate]{.underline} the
treacherous waters of [strategic ambiguity]{.underline}, where the
slightest misstep could unleash a chain reaction leading to unthinkable
devastation.

The path to averting this nuclear catastrophe lies in the hands of those
with the foresight, courage, and diplomatic acumen to bridge the
widening chasm between the global powers. It will require a fundamental
shift in mindset, from the zero-sum game of political grandstanding to
the recognition that the survival of humanity is the ultimate prize.

The Middle East, with its entrenched conflicts and competing interests,
presents the greatest challenge in this quest for peace. Resolving
longstanding disputes, addressing the root causes of regional tensions,
and cultivating a culture of mutual understanding and compromise must be
the guiding principles. As the world watches with bated breath, the onus
falls upon the leaders of these nations to rise above their own egos and
ideological differences. [The specter of **nuclear war**]{.underline},
once unthinkable, now [looms **large**]{.underline}, and the
[**[consequences]{.mark}** of inaction [are
**unimaginable**]{.mark}]{.underline}

https://www.esgdive.com/news/bp-cuts-renewable-spending-doubles-down-on-fossil-fuels-in-strategy-reset/741287/\]

[Oil giant BP is scaling back spending on renewables]{.underline} and
clean energy [and increasing investments in oil]{.underline} and gas as
part of a strategy reset announced Wednesday.

The United Kingdom-based energy company said [its budget allocation to
the energy transition]{.underline} business --- including investments in
biogas, biofuel, carbon capture and storage, electric vehicle charging
and hydrogen --- [would be "significantly lower]{.underline}." BP is now
planning to make "select" and "disciplined" investments in the
transition business that will range between \$1.5 billion and \$2
billion per year. [The new allocation is over \$5 billion per year less
than BP's prior renewables budget.]{.underline}

Concurrently, [BP will ramp up oil and gas spending to around \$10
billion per year and aim to grow fossil fuel production to between 2.3
million and 2.5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in
2030]{.underline}, the company announced as part of the reset.

Dive Insight:

BP unveiled the changes during a capital markets update, which focused
on a pivot back to its core business of producing oil and gas to support
a "stronger balance sheet and resilient distributions."

"[We are reducing and reallocating capital expenditure to our
highest-returning businesses to drive growth]{.underline}, and
relentlessly pursuing performance improvements and cost efficiency,"
BP's CEO Murray Auchincloss said after unveiling the company's revised
strategy Wednesday. "This is all in service of sustainably growing cash
flow and returns."

The relationship between oil prices and renewable energy is a topic of
significant importance in the context of global energy markets and
environmental sustainability. [Oil prices]{.underline} have
traditionally [play]{.underline}ed [a central role in shaping energy
policy and market dynamics]{.underline} \[17\] . [When oil prices surge,
governments,]{.underline} and industries [often turn to
renewable]{.underline} energy sources as an attractive alternative
\[3\]. However, this relationship is not as straightforward as it may
seem.

Firstly, [high oil prices can act as a catalyst for investments in
renewable energy]{.underline}. When oil prices rise, there is a sense of
urgency to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. This leads to increased
investments in wind, solar, and hydroelectric power. It also prompts
research and development in energy-efficient technologies \[51\].
However, this relationship can be fickle. When [oil prices drop,
investments in renewable energy can decrease, as the economic incentive
for sustainable alternatives weakens]{.underline} \[36\].

## Answers to Impact Turns

### 2NC --- O/V: High Prices Good

#### High prices put a cap on [all conflict]{.underline}\-\--Capitalist Peace Theory

**Hillebrand 8**, Associate Professor of International Economics
Patterson School of Diplomacy and International Commerce University of
Kentucky (Evan, " **[[How Will]{.mark} Future [Oil Prices]{.mark}
[Affect Geopolitics]{.mark}?]{.underline}**,"
<http://www.uky.edu/~ehill2/dynpage_upload/files/How%20Will%20Future%20Oil%20Prices%20Affect%20Geopolitics.pdf>

In the EIA work (see figure 35, reproduced below) [[world oil prices are
assumed to take]{.mark} [three]{.mark}]{.underline} possible widely
[[divergent paths]{.underline}]{.mark}, from mid 2006 to 2030.
[Divergent price paths could be [motivated]{.mark}
[in]{.mark}]{.underline} many different ways, such as **[[differences in
growth of]{.mark} [demand]{.mark}]{.underline}**, differences in
assumptions about the technology of energy usage, or most importantly,
differences in assumptions about the geological accessibility of oil. In
the IEO2007 the different price paths result mainly from the assumption
of different oilproduction paths outside of the United States. Further,
it is assumed that those paths are dictated more by geological
considerations than by policy choices or political constraints. 5 I
constrained the IFs model to roughly replicate the world oil production
assumptions portrayed in the IEO2007 scenarios. These scenarios show
world oil production in 2030 ranging from 101.9 million barrels per day
(mbd) in the high price/low production scenario, to 117.8 mbd in the
reference case, to 127.7 mbd in the low price/high production case. The
IEO scenarios are not integrated with a world economic model, nor are
alternate fuels considered except in the US case. Thus I had to fill in
the details, as it were, using the IFs model, which does integrate
global demand and supply of 6 fuel sources (oil, coal, natural gas,
hydro, nuclear, and other) with economic growth and energy demand in 182
countries. In the IFs model, economic growth in every country responds
endogenously to change in energy production and energy prices. In
addition, the IFs model projects quite substantial shifts among energy
sources given large swings in relative prices. Thus the final results
cannot be in any way construed to be implied by the DOE analysis: the
DOE results are too sparse for that. The results reported are my own
scenarios---based loosely on the DOE price and oil production
assumptions---but using the IFs model as the basic platform for
analysis. The different oil market assumptions, it will become clear,
have quite dramatically different implications for global economic and
political futures. In this work, as in the IEO2007 and in most other
long-run forecasting work,2 the basecase is for continued strong global
economic growth and some degree of convergence between the OECD and
non-OECD countries. Growth rates are projected basically as a
continuation of trends: strong technological growth in the OECD
countries, 2 See, for example, the economic growth projections
underlying the IPCC climate change projections at
http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/ddc/sres/index.html (2000), or Maddison
(2007). One major exception is Meadows et al. (2004) 6 strong investment
coupled with continued modernization in non-OECD Asia, but a gradual
slowing from the very high growth rates of recent decades. For the other
nonOECD regions, the forecast assumes a gradual improvement in economic
governance that leads to a more efficient use of capital and more
domestic competition. Embedded in the base case is increasing
globalization, a lack of major conflicts, and reasonably successful
fiscal management by OECD and non-OECD governments. I imposed these
energy and economic numbers on the IFs model3 and used the model to
generate its own long range geopolitical scenario. The IFs model
projects variables such as the level of democratization, geopolitical
power, risk of domestic instability, and the risk of war4 . **[[Under
the base case energy]{.mark} and economic assumptions]{.underline}**,
and under the myriad assumptions underlying the IFs model, [[the
geopolitical landscape shifts in a benign]{.mark} [direction. Rising
GDP]{.mark} per capita [and generational change leading to]{.mark}
larger percentages of populations growing up without want lead to
[growing]{.mark} [democratization]{.mark}]{.underline} (Inglehart,
2000). [Faster economic growth in China]{.underline} and the other
non-OECD countries [leads to a gradual decline in the share of world
power held by the United States and the EU and a rise by
China]{.underline}. [Economic growth and [consolidation of democracy
lead to a diminution]{.mark}]{.underline} almost
**[[everywhere]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[in the]{.mark} [risk
of]{.mark}]{.underline} internal [[war]{.underline}]{.mark} (Goldstone,
2004). The rise of great powers such as China and India compared to the
relative decline of US power could lead to an increase in the risk of
interstate war (Tamen, 2000), but this scenario assumes [[China and
India]{.underline}]{.mark}, in particular, **[[are]{.mark}

reveal itself both at home and abroad]{.underline}. In America, [[there
is]{.mark} the **[direct economic impact]{.mark}** of thousands of
layoffs and the collapse in oil and gas capital
expenditures]{.underline} (which accounted for almost 15 percent of
overall U.S. capital expenditures in 2013). But [these losses don't
account for [oil's]{.mark} **[massive ripple

[construction]{.mark}, [metals]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the army of
[businesses]{.mark} that partner with the oil and gas

#### Trade lessens the intensity and quantity of wars\-\--best and most recent studies prove

Julian **Adorney 13,** economic historian, entrepreneur, and contributor
for the Ludwig von Mises Institute. He's citing Professor McDonald who
teaches courses on international relations theory, international
political economy, and international security at University of Texas at
Austin. (, Foundation for Economic Education, "Want Peace? Promote Free
Trade", 10/15,
[http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/want-peace-promote-free-trade](http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/want-peace-promote-free-trade)//jk)

Frédéric Bastiat famously claimed that "**[[if goods don't cross
borders, soldiers will.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}** Bastiat argued that
[[free trade]{.mark} between countries could reduce international
**conflict** because trade **[forges connections]{.mark}** between
nations and [gives]{.mark} each country **an [incentive to avoid
war]{.mark}** with its trading partners. If every nation were an
economic island, the lack of positive interaction created by trade could
leave more room for conflict]{.underline}. Two hundred years after
Bastiat, libertarians take this idea as gospel. Unfortunately, not
everyone does. But as recent [research shows, the [**historical evidence
confirms** Bastiat's famous claim.]{.mark}]{.underline} To Trade or to
Raid In "Peace through Trade or Free Trade?" [professor Patrick J.
McDonald]{.underline}, from the University of Texas at Austin,
[empirically tested whether greater levels of protectionism]{.underline}
in a country (tariffs, quotas, etc.) would [increase]{.underline} the
probability of international [conflict]{.underline} in that nation. [He
[used]{.mark} a tool called **[dyads]{.mark}** [to analyze]{.mark}
[every]{.mark} [country's]{.mark} international [relations]{.mark} from
1960 until 2000.]{.underline} A dyad is the interaction between one
country and another country: German and French relations would be one
dyad, German and Russian relations would be a second, French and
Australian relations would be a third. He further broke this down into
dyad-years; the relations between Germany and France in 1965 would be
one dyad-year, the relations between France and Australia in 1973 would
be a second, and so on. Using these dyad-years, [McDonald analyzed [the
behavior **of every country in the world**]{.mark} for the past 40
years. His analysis [showed a **negative correlation** between]{.mark}
free [trade and conflict:]{.mark} The more freely a country trades, the
fewer wars it engages in. Countries that engage in free trade are less
likely to invade and less likely to be invaded.]{.underline} The Causal
Arrow Of course, [this finding might be a matter of confusing
correlation for causation]{.underline}. Maybe countries engaging in free
trade fight less often for some other reason, like the fact that they
tend also to be more democratic. Democratic countries make war less
often than empires do. [But McDonald controls]{.underline} for these
[variables]{.underline}. Controlling for a state's political structure
is important, because democracies and republics tend to fight less than
authoritarian regimes. [McDonald also controlled for a country's
economic growth, because countries in a recession are more likely to go
to war]{.underline} than those in a boom, often in order to distract
their people from their economic woes. [McDonald even controlled for
factors like geographic proximity]{.underline}: It's easier for Germany
and France to fight each other than it is for the United States and
China, because troops in the former group only have to cross a shared
border. [The takeaway from McDonald's analysis is that protectionism can
actually lead to conflict. McDonald found that a country in the bottom
10 percent for protectionism (meaning it is less protectionist than 90
percent of other countries) is 70 percent less likely to engage in a new
conflict (either as invader or as target) than one in the top 10 percent
for protectionism.]{.underline} Protectionism and War [Why does
protectionism lead to conflict, and why does free trade help to prevent
it?]{.underline} The answers, though well-known to classical liberals,
are worth mentioning. First[, [trade creates]{.mark} international
[**goodwill**.]{.mark} If Chinese and American businessmen trade on a
regular basis, both sides benefit]{.underline}. And m[utual benefit
disposes people to look for the good in each other. Exchange of goods
also promotes an exchange of cultures]{.underline}. For decades,
Americans saw China as a mysterious country with strange, even hostile
values. But in the 21st century, [trade between our nations has
increased markedly, and both countries know each other a little better
now]{.underline}. iPod-wielding Chinese teenagers are like American
teenagers, for example. They're not terribly mysterious. Likewise, the
Chinese understand democracy and American consumerism more than they
once did. [The countries may not find overlap in all of each other's
values, but trade has helped us to at least understand each other.
[Trade helps to **humanize**]{.mark} the [people]{.mark} that [you trade
with]{.mark}. And it's tougher to want to go to war with your human
trading partners than with a country you see only as lines on a map.
Second, trade gives nations an economic incentive to avoid
war.]{.underline} If Nation X sells its best steel to Nation Y, and its
businessmen reap plenty of profits in exchange, then businessmen on both
sides are going to oppose war. This was actually the case with Germany
and France right before World War I. Germany sold steel to France, and
German businessmen were firmly opposed to war. They only grudgingly came
to support it when German ministers told them that the war would only
last a few short months. German steel had a strong incentive to oppose
war, and if the situation had progressed a little differently---or if
the German government had been a little more realistic about the
timeline of the war---that incentive might have kept Germany out of
World War I. Third, [[protectionism promotes **hostility**.]{.mark} This
is why free trade]{.underline}, not just aggregate trade (which could be
accompanied by high tariffs and quotas), [leads to peace. If the United
States imposes a tariff on Japanese automobiles, that tariff hurts
Japanese businesses. It creates hostility in Japan toward the United
States]{.underline}. Japan might even retaliate with a tariff on U.S.
steel, hurting U.S. steel makers and angering our government, which
would retaliate with another tariff. [[Both countries]{.mark} now [have
an **excuse** to **leverage nationalist feelings** to **gain support at
home**; that makes]{.mark} outright [war]{.mark} with the other country
[an easier sell]{.mark}, should it come to that. In socioeconomic
academic circles, this is called the Richardson process of reciprocal
and increasing hostilities]{.underline}; the United States harms Japan,
which retaliates, causing the United States to retaliate again. History
shows that [the Richardson process can easily be applied to
protectionism. For instance, [in the 1930s, industrialized nations
raised tariffs]{.mark} and trade barriers; countries eschewed
multilateralism and turned inward. These decisions led to rising
hostilities, **which [helped set World War II in
motion]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} These factors help explain why **free trade
leads to peace, and protectionism leads to more conflict.**]{.underline}
Free Trade and Peace One final note: [McDonald's analysis shows that
taking a country from the top 10 percent for protectionism to the bottom
10 percent will reduce the probability of future conflict by 70
percent]{.underline}. He performed the same analysis for the democracy
of a country and showed that taking a country from the top 10 percent
(very democratic) to the bottom 10 percent (not democratic) would only
reduce conflict by 30 percent. Democracy is a well-documented deterrent:
The more democratic a country becomes, the less likely it is to resort
to international conflict. But [reducing protectionism, according to
McDonald, is more than twice as effective at reducing conflict than
becoming more democratic.]{.underline} Here in the United States, we
talk a lot about spreading democracy. We invaded Iraq partly to "spread
democracy." A New York Times op-ed by Professor Dov Ronen of Harvard
University claimed that "the United States has been waging an
ideological campaign to spread democracy around the world" since 1989.
One of the justifications for our international crusade is to make the
world a safer place. Perhaps [we should spend a little more time
spreading free trade instead. That might really lead to a more peaceful
world.]{.underline}

A region of inequality

[[How are]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Gulf states
**using**]{.underline}]{.mark} their [**[hydrocarbon revenues]{.mark}**
to **safeguard** their future]{.underline} in light of the risks of
climate change? The resources and capital of the Gulf states place them
at the top of the regional political and economic hierarchy, which is
characterised by increasing polarisation. There is chasmic inequality
between the poor countries of the region and the wealthy ones. For
example, GDP per capita in Yemen is \$701, while in the UAE it is
\$44,315.37Other examples of this differential can be found elsewhere in
the region: GDP per capita in Syria is \$533, while in Qatar it is
\$66,000.38 As a result of this imbalance the MENA countries do not
share the same prospects in terms of the effects of climate change. The
[political and [economic power]{.mark} of the Gulf states [means they
have more capacity to manage]{.mark} the problems of [a warming
climate]{.mark}]{.underline}. This ability is in contrast to that of
other countries in the region, such as Yemen, Lebanon and Syria, which
are suffering from a combination of economic collapse, suffocating
public debt, conflict and internal instability.

The status of the Gulf states' food security is one example of this
regional inequality. The GCC states are highly reliant on food imports,
and between 80 and 90 percent of commodities are imported. This creates
a vulnerability to geopolitical disruption that could affect logistics
and supply chains. The [Gulf [countries]{.mark}]{.underline} have used
their capital to mitigate this risk. They have [[**invested heavily**
in]{.mark} transport and storage [infrastructure]{.mark}. This means
that [they can import food]{.mark} from a number of different global
locales]{.underline}, thus [**[ensuring]{.mark}** that they have a
**[diversified]{.mark} source** of [commodities]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Gulf countries import food from all global regions and they have also
acquired land in North Africa, the Black Sea region, the US and Latin
America39. [They have [also established]{.mark} large [food
processing]{.mark}, poultry and dairy operations]{.underline}. These
facilities serve Gulf markets and provide some self-sufficiency, but
they still require the import of raw commodities, such as cattle feed.
More recently, the [Gulf [states have]{.mark} begun investing in
**[agri-tech]{.mark}** capabilities [that allow]{.mark} them to grow
[food]{.mark} in]{.underline} fully controlled **[[indoor]{.mark}
environment[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**.40 These projects are energy
intensive and they benefit from a subsidised supply of electricity and
other inputs from Gulf governments.41

[This food production is a form of ecological
modernisation]{.underline}, and it is an attempt to gain greater control
over the social and environmental relations of food production, which
provides benefits in a warming climate. [The absence of domestic
agriculture creates a reliance on imports]{.underline} [but]{.underline}
it [also **lessens**]{.underline} the [direct exposure to climate
change.]{.underline} Societies that depend heavily on smallholder
agriculture as a source of income and employment are more vulnerable to
the effects of climate breakdown. Agriculture in Yemen, Egypt and
Morocco accounts for between 20 and 35 percent of employment, while in
the Gulf states it accounts for less than 5 percent.42 The Gulf states
are not immune from this danger altogether, as climate breakdown may
compromise production in regions from which they source commodities, but
[[their **buying power**]{.mark} and **diversified**]{.underline}
network of [**supply chains** [reduces]{.mark} their
[exposure]{.mark}]{.underline} -- at least for the time being. [The [use
of oil]{.mark} revenues [to finance]{.mark} food imports [is
an]{.mark}other [example of the way]{.mark} in which these
[states]{.mark} **remain highly [dependent]{.mark}**
[on]{.mark}]{.underline} [the **export** of [oil]{.mark} and
gas]{.underline}. It is a matter of existential importance for them.

The regional inequality is also manifested in Gulf investment in
agribusiness abroad. There is sometimes a tendency in development
literature to assume that cooperation and regional investment flows are
a means to address the food security needs of MENA states. These flows
are proposed as a means to resolve the food insecurity of the Gulf
states and at the same time invest in the agriculture sectors in poorer
Arab economies.43 However, the reality of Gulf investment in agriculture
contradicts this interpretation. The acquisition of large areas of land
in Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia constitute plantations that consume water
and other resources for food that is exported directly back to the Gulf
states. One of the most common crops on these enclosures is alfalfa, a
cattle feed that is used in the large dairy operations that have been
established in the Gulf states.44 These calories are removed from
economies that have high levels of food insecurity and a history of
famine. In Sudan, for example, Gulf investors have acquired more than
500,000 hectares of land, often in prime agricultural areas that are
adjacent to the Nile -- land that is often claimed by small farmers.45
These farms produce grain and cattle feed that is exported back to the
GCC economies, even as Sudan society remains food insecure, with 12
million people in Sudan, out of a total population of 44 million,
currently estimated to face acute food insecurity.46 Half a million
children are estimated to suffer from severe acute malnutrition in the
country. These kinds of large-scale land acquisitions are often
described as 'land-grabbing' and pose well-documented threats to the
rights, livelihoods and health of local people.47 Such land grabs and
export-oriented large-scale agricultural production weaken the food
sovereignty of countries like Sudan.

Another dimension of the regional inequality is storage capacity for
food grains, which creates a buffer against price spikes and supply
shocks. This is particularly important for Arab countries, given their
reliance on imported food and the potential for climate and market
shocks. [The Gulf [states]{.mark} have [invested]{.mark} heavily
[in]{.mark} **grain [silos]{.mark}** [and **food stores**]{.mark}, and
this infrastructure has been included in port and airport projects in
these countries]{.underline}. As a result, their storage capacity far
outstrips that of other countries in the region. For example, Saudi
Arabia has a grain storage capacity of around 3.5 million tonnes, for a
population of 35 million,48 whereas Egypt's grain storage capacity is
around 3.4 million tonnes, for a population three times larger than
Saudi Arabia's, at around 105 million people.49 Qatar's storage capacity
is around 250,000 tonnes, for a population of 2.6 million,50 while Yemen
has a similar capacity, for a population of 30 million. This contrast
also exists in other comparisons with countries around the region,
particularly with those societies that have been hit by war and
disasters. For example, the devastating Beirut port explosion in August
2020 destroyed the harbour's 100,000-tonne grain silos.

In addition to food silos, the [Gulf states are]{.underline} also
[investing in]{.underline} other forms of [**infrastructure**
that]{.underline} will provide a means to [manage their essential
resources in the face of]{.underline} the effects of [climate
change]{.underline}. [[Saudi]{.underline}]{.mark} Arabia,
[[Qatar]{.underline} [and]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
[UAE]{.mark}]{.underline} have [recently [completed **water
storage**]{.mark} facilities [that will **guarantee
supply**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In some cases, [these facilities are some
of the biggest in the world]{.underline}: Qatar's 6.5 million cubic
metre water tank is sufficient for seven days of national consumption.51
The construction of this infrastructure illustrates how the Gulf states
are securitising their social metabolism; [water and food storage
capacity]{.underline} can [[**offer resilience** in the face
of]{.underline}]{.mark} conflict, **[[climate
crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}** and logistical disruption. This provides
an insight into the divergence of the region's developmental
trajectories: the capacity to deal with climate change, environmental
stress and their potential shocks is highly uneven.

#### The Gulf endures warming but [ONLY if]{.underline} current investments [keep up]{.underline}.

In recent years [the Gulf states' ability to deal with climate change
has been subject to speculation [in]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[Western
media]{.underline}]{.mark}. In some cases, [the very **survival** of
these countries has been called into question]{.underline}. According to
one article in the UK's Guardian, [[the region is likely to face]{.mark}
[an]{.mark} "**[apocalypse]{.mark}**" in the near future [as a result of
**temp**]{.mark}erature [increases]{.mark} and rising sea
levels]{.underline}.1 The piece paints a picture of states that are
shaped by hostile environments, with fragile societies that will be
pushed over the edge by the climate crisis. In addition to the
challenges of climate change, the article also intimates that a decline
in demand for oil and gas will be an additional cause of the demise of
the Gulf states, due to their dependence on the export of hydrocarbons.

Aside from their dramatic tone, [[reports of this kind
have]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[serious]{.mark} analytical
[shortcomings]{.mark}]{.underline}**. They tend to assume that the Gulf
states are passive actors in the politics of climate change. Rather than
a source of power, their control of 30-40 percent of proven oil reserves
is framed as a vulnerability, and it is implied that the increased use
of renewables will mean these countries become superfluous as the global
economy makes a transition to green forms of energy. Based on a
perception of shared environmental and climatic conditions, this framing
also surmises that the Gulf region is in the same boat as other parts of
the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) when it comes to the threat of
the climate crisis and the challenges of the energy transition.

This chapter contradicts these assumptions. It shows how, rather than
being powerless producers, the [Gulf countries are working to ensure
they remain at the centre of the global energy regime]{.underline}. This
entails the formulation of a dualistic policy: one that allows them to
benefit from both fossil fuels and renewable energies. The Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) countries are intent on extracting, producing
and selling oil and gas, and their downstream by-products, for as long
as there is demand.2 At the same time, they are also gaining a foothold
in renewable energy markets and in the development of other fuels, such
as hydrogen, and they are using their capital to invest in wind and
solar farms across the MENA region. In contrast to the assumption that
the Gulf countries are subject to the same socioecological dangers as
other MENA countries, this chapter also illustrates that some of [the
[GCC states are investing in **infrastructure** that will
**offer**]{.mark}]{.underline} some **[[protection from
crises]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[This will give them]{.mark} a [capacity
to manage food, water and energy that **far
surpasses**]{.mark}]{.underline} that of **[[other
countries]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in the region.]{.underline}

### AT: Petro State Adventurism

#### Petrostates are [peaceful]{.underline}.

Accessed 7-18-2025; RS\]

[When oil prices decline, however, petrostates may feel compelled to
throw caution to the wind. Low oil prices could increase conflict
through at least three different mechanisms: battling over a smaller
market, diversionary conflict, and signaling strength.]{.underline}
First, as Pischedda (Citation2020) suggests, actors facing an acute
window of vulnerability may be tempted to seize the resources of another
actor to stave off decline.Footnote4 This is the Battling over a Smaller
Market mechanism, and is similar to the dynamics of what Meierding
(Citation2020) calls "oil gambits": oil conflicts fought out of
desperation. Markowitz and others argue that this sort of conquest is
particularly likely among countries that depend on rents extracted from
land, and when the resources in question are more easily lootable
(Markowitz Citation2020; Markowitz et al. Citation2020; Coe and
Markowitz Citation2021). Altman (Citation2017, Citation2020) similarly
shows that conquest attempts since 1945 tend to be characterized by
sudden land seizures (faits accomplis) rather than through threats.

The Battling over a Smaller Market mechanism would expect greater
petrostate conflict initiation when oil prices are lower, and would in
particular predict aggression toward other petrostates and oil-rich
territory. [The logic here is that when faced with a negative shock to
their oil revenues, petrostates may try to reverse their fortunes.
Petrostates might expect that seizing additional oil resources will help
them weather the impact of low oil prices for two reasons. The first is
by simply increasing the total amount of oil revenue they bring in each
year (Meierding Citation2022). The second is by giving the petrostate a
greater share of global production, and thus allowing them more
influence on the oil market]{.underline} and greater ability to shape
prices unilaterally (Bordoff Citation2020). During the low oil price era
of the 1990s and early 2000s, for example, Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, Trinidad
and Tobago, and Venezuela all initiated disputes over oil-rich
territory.Footnote5

[Second, petrostates might also elect to initiate more conflict when oil
prices are low to distract domestic audiences. This is the Diversionary
Conflict mechanism. Because reduced oil revenue constrains petrostates'
ability to distribute public goods and patronage at home, low oil prices
can lead to anti-government opposition and unrest. To sideline and
ultimately reduce public dissatisfaction, the government might try to
generate a "rally-around-the-flag" effect by diverting popular ire
toward a foreign enemy and stoking nationalism]{.underline} (Lee
Citation1977; Oakes Citation2012). Like the Battling over a Smaller
Market mechanism, the Diversionary Conflict mechanism is based on a
"gambling for resurrection" logic in which petrostates might be willing
to run great risks in the hopes of staving off a negative outcome (Downs
and Rocke Citation1994). But what matters here is not so much the
military or policy objectives of the war, like in the Battling over a
Smaller Market mechanism, but rather the existence of the conflict
itself, and the effects that a sense of common struggle and victory over
a common enemy has on policymakers' domestic political fortunes
(Meierding Citation2022). Some observers, for example, speculate that
Russia's decision to escalate its involvement in Syria was at least
partly to divert attention from the country's economic woes amidst low
oil prices during the mid- and late-2010s (Åslund Citation2016; Petkova
Citation2020).

Finally, [negative shocks to their oil revenue may lead petrostates to
initiate more conflict to show strength, via the Signaling Strength
mechanism. A large body of literature points to the emphasis that states
place on cultivating reputations for strength and resolve, as doing so
can allow them to more effectively use threats of force to deter and
coerce other countries]{.underline} (Schelling Citation1966). Scholars
debate the degree to which reputation "matters" in terms of whether
adversaries believe that a country's past behavior is a reliable
predictor of its future behavior (Mercer Citation1996; Press
Citation2005; Weisiger and Yarhi-Milo Citation2015; Lupton
Citation2020). [However, **even reputation skeptics** concede that
states often believe their reputation matters, and act to build and
preserve their reputation for toughness]{.underline} (Tang Citation2005;
Yarhi-Milo Citation2018). Clare and Danilovic (Citation2010) find that
states are more likely to initiate conflict when other states have
reason to doubt its willingness to fight.

[By a similar logic, one might expect declines in oil wealth to lead
petrostates to initiate conflict. Because reduced oil revenue constrains
petrostates' ability to invest in military power, they might fear that
other states will be tempted to prey on their weakness]{.underline}.
Thus, petrostates may initiate conflict to offset this perceived
weakness and signal their willingness to fight. This does not
necessarily imply that petrostates will launch prolonged, costly wars or
engage in a campaign of serial aggression. Rather, they may pick
targeted fights without necessarily crossing the threshold into actual
war.

[When oil prices are high, by contrast, petrostates may be sufficiently
self-confident to refrain from picking fights to signal strength.
Indeed, targets may be more likely to concede to a petrostate's demands
without having to fight when oil prices are high because they know that
it has more resources to draw upon during wartime and is thus likely to
be a tougher opponent]{.underline}. In other words, targets may
effectively self-select out of conflict with petrostates when oil prices
are high (Fearon Citation1994, Citation1995).

#### Importers can punish aggressors 

**Bakaki 16** -- (Zorzeta Bakaki, Lecturer in the Department of
Government @ U. of Essex, "Fossil Fuel Rents: Who Initiates
International Crises?" *Peace Economics, Peace Science and Public
Policy*, 22:2, 2016)

Introduction

[Often literature employs the term "petro-aggression" to show that major
oil exporters are more likely to engage in crises when oil prices are
high]{.underline} (Friedman, 2009). In other words, [oil rents reduce
"the leader's risk of domestic punishment for foreign policy
adventurism]{.underline}" (Colgan, 2013: 161) [and thus, provide
incentives to engage in international crises.]{.underline}

Other literature suggests that [the [increasing globalization of energy
markets]{.mark}]{.underline} (Goldthau and Witte, 2009) [[and]{.mark}
the increasing [competition in]{.mark} [certain segments of]{.mark} oil
[production]{.mark}]{.underline} (Hughes and Long, 2015) **[[has changed
states' behavior]{.mark} in the international system]{.underline}**.
[These changing [market conditions]{.mark} often [decrease the incentive
for]{.mark} foreign policy [adventurism because consumers are able to
substitute unreliable suppliers]{.mark}]{.underline}.

This study builds on the idea that market incentives matter (Månsson,
2014) by systematically analyzing whether fossil fuel exporters1 tend to
engage more often in international crises. I extend the framework
developed by Colgan (2013) within the framework of "producer politics".
I introduce [[a "rents-pacification" argument]{.mark} that
[suggests]{.mark}]{.underline} that **[fossil fuel [exporters do not
risk their]{.mark} fossil [revenues in order to get engaged in a
crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[I examine the opportunity costs associated with assertive behavior of
exporters across three market structures: (1) monopoly, (2) oligopoly
and (3) free market]{.underline}**. [Based on the rates of fossil fuel
rents and the market competition, [gas represents a]{.mark} stylized
example for a [monopoly]{.mark} (very few competitors if not only one
competitor) (]{.underline}Gordon et al., 2003; Saidu, 2008; Henderson
and Pirani, 2014), [[oil]{.mark} for [an oligopoly]{.mark} (a few
competitors]{.underline}) (Cologni and Manera, 2014) [and coal for a
free market structure (]{.underline}many competitors) (Böhringer and
Rutherford, 2002). [Under conditions of monopoly, I expect the
domination of a "petro-aggression" mechanism, because states have
relatively low opportunity costs of initiating a crisis]{.underline}.
**[[Under]{.mark} conditions of [oligopoly]{.mark}, it dominates a
"rents-pacification" mechanism, as [exporters have to face the
possibility of consumers switching]{.mark} to other
suppliers]{.underline}**. Finally, [under free market
conditions]{.underline}, I expect that [the opportunity costs of
initiating a crisis are low since free market products are easily
accessible and inexpensive]{.underline}.

[[There is little]{.mark} systematic [research]{.mark} and inclusive
empirical findings, [linking fossil fuels and international
crises]{.mark}]{.underline} onset (Koubi et al., 2014; Sovacool, 2014;
Bove et al., 2015). Apart from making a general contribution to this
strand of research, [[this study]{.mark}: (1) [systematically tests the
probability of states]{.mark}' [crises initiation]{.mark}, (2)
[disaggregates fossil fuels according to]{.mark} different [market

#### Costs of waging wars outweigh perceived benefits

Emily **Meierding 16**. Naval Postgraduate School, Assistant Professor.
04/02/2016. "Dismantling the Oil Wars Myth." Security Studies, vol. 25,
no. 2, pp. 258--288.

[In the mid-2000s, [as oil prices rose]{.mark} to over \$140 per barrel,
many [analysts predicted]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[imminent]{.mark}
international [oil wars]{.mark}]{.underline}** [over the
world's]{.underline} increasingly **[scarce petroleum]{.underline}**
resources.1 Michael T. **[Klare]{.underline}** [described interstate oil
competition as "a]{.underline} **[voracious, zero-sum
contest]{.underline}** that, if allowed to continue along present paths,
can only lead to conflict among the major powers."2 Gal Luft, director
of the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security, predicted that
China and the United States would come to blows over oil resources: "You
have two powers competing over the same sandbox. . . . As a country of
China's size grows, there will be a moment when the moment of reckoning
comes."3 Politicians expressed similar alarm; in her nomination hearings
before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, former US Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton asserted: "We know that there will be disputes
over energy resources . . . in the Arctic."4

Expectations of great power oil wars have declined somewhat as a result
of the North American shale gas and tight oil boom. However, [[observers
continue to predict]{.mark} that oil [will provoke regional
conflicts]{.mark} in resource-rich areas such as the South China Sea,
East China Sea, and the eastern Mediterranean]{.underline}.5 [The Arctic
is also still a source of concern, especially following Russia's
expansionism in Crimea]{.underline}.6 [In addition, the idea of
interstate oil wars remains widely accepted amongst the general public,
policymakers, and international relations theorists]{.underline}.
Although realists and liberals usually disagree about the likelihood of
militarized conflict in the international system, their views converge
on the question of whether fighting for oil can pay. Most people assume
that competition over control of oil resources is a significant cause of
interstate conflict.7

[**However, [there is little empirical evidence to support this]{.mark}
claim**. [Few researchers]{.mark} have [attempted
to]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[systematically
evaluate]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the [relationships]{.mark} between oil
and international militarized conflict]{.underline}, and studies that
have been conducted have produced mixed results.8 [Scholars
have]{.underline} **[also]{.underline}** [failed to rigorously
articulate or critique the]{.underline} **[logical
underpinnings]{.underline}** [of oil war claims. As a result, our
understanding of]{.underline} the frequency and dynamics of [interstate
oil wars is]{.underline} [**minimal**. This lack of knowledge is
problematic, as]{.underline} overly or insufficiently **[alarmist
expectations]{.underline}** [are likely to inspire]{.underline}
**[costly and ineffective]{.underline}** conflict prevention
**[efforts]{.underline}**. The lacuna also means that researchers and
policymakers should not be reassured by the recent collapse in oil
prices, as [it has]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** yet **[been
established]{.underline}** [that low oil prices are correlated with a
reduced frequency of oil wars]{.underline}. Indeed, many of our
assumptions need to be tested before we can confidently claim that oil
does or does not cause interstate conflict.

This article argues that [the [risk of]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[international [oil wars]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[has
been]{.underline} **[overstated]{.underline}**]{.mark}[. People's belief
in oil wars is [**rooted in the assumption that fighting for oil can
pay**.]{.mark} This assumption is based on an accurate assessment of
oil's]{.underline} **[utility]{.underline}**; it is an extremely
valuable natural resource. [However]{.underline}, [proponents
of]{.underline} what I label [the oil war hypothesis]{.underline}
**[err]{.underline}** [by [overlooking]{.mark} the]{.underline}
[**[extensive obstacles to seizing, producing, and marketing foreign oil
resources]{.mark}**. As a result, they overestimate the utility
of]{.underline} **[fighting]{.underline}** [for oil and, consequently,
the]{.underline} **[significance]{.underline}** [of oil as a cause
of]{.underline} [**international conflict**. This article identifies
four sets of impediments to exploiting foreign oil: [**invasion costs**,
**occupation costs**, **international costs**, and]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[investment cost]{.mark}s]{.underline}**. It argues that,
[**[collectively]{.mark}**, these obstacles **[dramatically
reduce]{.mark}**]{.underline} [the [payoffs]{.mark} of fighting for oil.
As a result, **oil wars are unlikely**. [Conflicts may occur in oil-rich
territories]{.mark}. However, [these are **not wars for**]{.mark}
**oil**]{.underline}.

The argument is tested through [[an examination of]{.underline} **[four
historical conflicts]{.underline}**]{.mark} [that are
[commonly]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[identified]{.underline}**]{.mark} [as
international oil wars]{.underline}: Japan's invasion of the Dutch East
Indies (1941--42), Iraq's invasion of Kuwait (1990), the Iran--Iraq War
(1980--88), and the Chaco War between Bolivia and Paraguay (1932--35).
Three of these four contests are highly likely cases of oil wars, based
on the causal logic underpinning the oil war hypothesis. Yet, through
close historical analysis, I [find that the [desire to control]{.mark}
additional [oil]{.mark} resources was]{.underline} **[[not the]{.mark}
fundamental [cause]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[of]{.underline}
**[any]{.underline}**]{.mark} of the conflicts. In the Chaco War and
Iran--Iraq War, oil interests did not contribute to leaders' decisions
for international aggression. In the other two conflicts, the Japanese
and Iraqi governments aimed to acquire foreign oil reserves. However,
their motives did not conform to the causal logic underpinning the oil
war hypothesis. [Leaders were not attempting to]{.underline}
**[seize]{.underline}** profitable **[petroleum prizes]{.underline}**.
Instead, Japanese and Iraqi officials believed that foreign petroleum
access was a requirement for regime survival. [**Security needs**, not
oil greed, were the fundamental cause of their attacks.]{.underline}
Absent this existential threat, they would not have attempted to seize
foreign oil.

### AT: Econ Turn

#### Low prices [deck the economy]{.underline}

**The Economist '16** (The Economist, "Who's afraid of cheap oil?" 23
January 2017,
http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21688854-low-energy-prices-ought-be-shot-arm-economy-think-again-whos-afraid-cheap)

[[Cheap oil]{.mark} also]{.underline} **[[hurts
demand]{.underline}]{.mark}** in more important ways. [When crude was
over \$100 a barrel it made sense to spend on exploration in
out-of-the-way provinces, such as the Arctic, west Africa and deep below
the saline rock off the coast of Brazil]{.underline}. **[[As prices have
tumbled, so has investment]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Projects
worth]{.mark} **[\$380 billion]{.mark}** [have been]{.mark} **[put on
hold]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [In America spending on fixed assets in the
oil industry has **fallen by half** from its peak. **[The poison has
spread]{.mark}**]{.underline}: [[the purchasing managers' index]{.mark}
for December, of 48.2, [registered an]{.mark} **[accelerating
contraction]{.mark}** across the whole of American
manufacturing]{.underline}. In Brazil the harm to Petrobras, the
national oil company, from the oil price has been exacerbated by a
corruption scandal that has paralysed the highest echelons of
government.

[The [fall in investment and asset prices is]{.mark} **[all the more
harmful]{.mark}** [because it is]{.mark} **[so
rapid.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [As oil collapses against the backdrop of
a **fragile world economy**, **[it could trigger
defaults]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[The possible financial spillovers are hard to assess]{.underline}.
[[Much of the \$650 billion rise in]{.mark} emerging-market corporate
[debt]{.mark} since 2007 [has been in oil and commodity
industries]{.mark}]{.underline}. [**[Oil plays a central role]{.mark}**
[in a clutch of emerging markets prone to trouble]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[With GDP in Russia falling, the government could well face a budgetary
crisis within months. Venezuela, where inflation is above 140%, has
declared an economic state of emergency.]{.underline}

Other oil producers are prone to a similar, if milder, cycle of weaker
growth, a falling currency, imported inflation and tighter monetary
policy. Central banks in Colombia and Mexico raised interest rates in
December. Nigeria is rationing dollars in a desperate (probably doomed)
effort to boost its currency.

[There are strains in rich countries, too]{.underline}. [Yields on
corporate high-yield bonds have jumped from about 6.5% in mid-2015 to
**9.7%** today]{.underline}. Investors' aversion spread quickly from
energy firms to all borrowers. With bears stalking equity markets,
[global indices are plumbing]{.underline} **[30-month
lows]{.underline}** (see article). [Central bankers in rich countries
worry that persistent low inflation will feed expectations of static or
falling prices]{.underline}---[in effect]{.underline}, **[raising real
interest rates]{.underline}**. [Policymakers' ability to respond is
**constrained** because rates, close to zero, cannot be cut much
more]{.underline}.

#### Low prices cause widespread bankruptcies\-\--wrecks stock market

**Colgan 20**, PhD, Professor @ Brown (Jeff, "This is the biggest oil
price crash in decades. That may not be great for the U.S. economy.,"
*Washington Post*,
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/09/this-is-biggest-oil-price-crash-decades-that-may-not-be-great-us-economy/>)

On the one hand, [low prices]{.underline} might **[hurt the U.S.
economy]{.underline}**

[Lower oil prices]{.underline} are a mixed blessing for the United
States. Lower gasoline prices will benefit consumers and lower
transportation costs for businesses. However, they **[are very bad for
U.S. oil producers]{.underline}**. [Highly indebted fracking firms may
not be able to obtain further bank loans or perhaps even stay in
business]{.underline}. States such as [Texas]{.underline} and North
Dakota, where fossil fuel extraction is a big part of the economy,
[would face hard times]{.underline}. **[The pain could spread to the
entire U.S. economy]{.underline}**. [If low prices continue for months
or years, there will probably be bankruptcies and mergers in the oil
sector, perhaps lowering gross domestic product or exacerbating the
stock market decline on Wall Street]{.underline}.

#### High oil prices are good for the economy 

**Richter** 6/20/**2019** (Wolf, a San Francisco based executive,
entrepreneur, start up specialist, and author, with extensive
international work experience, 6/20/19, "[Bring on Higher Oil Prices:
They'll Boost the US Economy.]{.underline} Powell Sees it Too. A New
Experience for the US",
<https://wolfstreet.com/2019/06/20/bring-on-higher-oil-prices-theyll-boost-the-us-economy-powell-sees-it-too-new-experience-for-the-us/>)

[Here's why.]{.underline} Powered by the iffy situation in the Persian
Gulf, the Strait of Hormuz, and the Gulf of Oman, with attacks on
tankers and now the downing of a US drone, the price of crude oil got a
little nervous in recent days. WTI jumped about 6% today to over \$57 a
barrel. But this was just a minor uptick in the overall scheme of
things: [The US, which has become the largest oil producer in the world,
is in the middle of its second oil bust in five years]{.underline}:
These two oil busts are largely a consequence of surging US crude oil
production. During the oil bust of 2014-2016, the price of WTI collapsed
by over 75%, careening from \$107 per barrel to a low of \$27 per barrel
in 18 months, before starting to rebound. In the process, a slew of
oil-and-gas drillers filed for bankruptcy. For a while it looked like
the shale boom, where all the growth in production had come from, was
running out of money, and therefore out of fuel. Production fell sharply
from early 2015 through much of 2016, but then new money from Wall
Street appeared, and production began to soar again, hitting new records
all along the way. Shale wells produce a variety of liquid hydrocarbons
(they also produce gaseous hydrocarbons which are not included here).
This production of crude oil and petroleum products soared from just
over 7 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2010 to 16.6 million bpd
currently, according to EIA data: This surge in production comes even as
shale oil-and-gas drillers have essentially been cash-flow negative in
their entire history, drilling more and more of their investors' funds
forever into the ground. But so far so good --- as long as it's not my
money. The US used to be the largest net importer of crude oil and
petroleum products in the world. Between 2005 and 2008, "net imports"
(imports minus exports) of crude oil and petroleum products exceeded 12
million bpd. But surging production in the US has slashed imports. And
recently exports have surged, and the trade in crude oil and petroleum
products is now nearly balanced between the US and the rest of the
world. And the net imports are heading toward zero -- the point where
the US imports as much as it exports. [In February, net imports were
down to just 176,000 barrels a day, the lowest in the EIA data going
back to 1971. In]{.underline} March, the most recent data available, net
imports were 842,000 barrels a day: [The fact that the US imports a lot
of crude oil and petroleum products, even as it exports a lot too, is
related to a variety of factors and market conditions.]{.underline} For
example, California is the fourth largest oil producing state in the US,
but it's not enough. It's not connected via pipelines to producing
regions east of the Rocky Mountains. So it gets some oil by oil train.
It imports oil from Alaska. And it imports the rest from other
countries. But [California's refineries also export gasoline to Mexico
and other countries]{.underline} -- try to explain this to Californians
who groan under high gasoline prices! This [mismatch of supply and
demand, lacking infrastructure, and global factors plays out across the
US and leads to a mix of imports and exports.]{.underline} The [US has
become a huge oil producer despite the cash-burning characteristics of
the shale oil business]{.underline}. But the very fact that the shale
oil business burns so much cash makes it a large contributor to the US
economy as every dollar that gets "burned" is actually spent in the US
and gets recycled in the US economy. [The jobs are well paid. The
business has a large high-tech component, involving highly paid
technology employees and contractors, along with expensive specialized
tech equipment and software. In addition, it involves sophisticated
heavy equipment in the field that is fabricated in factories around the
US]{.underline}. It involves [transportation]{.underline} to get this
equipment and supplies to the oil field. It involves the [construction
of infrastructure,]{.underline} such as pipelines and oil storage
facilities, processing facilities, and the like. [Oil-and-gas related
industries and their suppliers weigh heavily in US industrial production
and manufacturing, but also in services such as
engineering]{.underline}. [Back when the US was the largest net-importer
of crude oil in the world]{.underline}, any increase in the price of oil
siphoned most of this money out of the US economy to oil-producing
countries. As consumers and businesses had to shift spending dollars
from US products to products based on imported oil, a big surge in oil
prices -- [the "oil shock" -- could trigger a recession]{.underline}.
[This picture has now completely changed. And Fed Chair]{.underline}
Jerome [Powell]{.underline} [[made note of it]{.underline} during the
post-meeting press
conference](https://wolfstreet.com/2019/06/20/what-powell-really-said-about-the-economy-and-what-would-trigger-a-rate-cut/)
on Wednesday. While there are some strengths in the US economy, such as
services and consumer spending, he said, there are also some weak spots,
particularly business investment and manufacturing production. He listed
a number of factors, including "lower oil prices." They not only
contribute to "lower investment," but also to lower manufacturing
production as purchases of new equipment are put on hold. This is
already showing up. The plunge in oil prices since August has caused the
oil-and-gas sector to get skittish with capital expenditures this year,
and Powell picked up on that. Investment in the US shale sector has a
big impact on the real economy. This became apparent during the 2014-16
oil bust when the sector drastically cut back on investing. The overall
economy started to slow in 2015, and in 2016, GDP growth was just 1.6%,
the worst since the Great Recession. When the shale patch recovered,
economic growth accelerated. [A higher oil price, say over \$75 a
barrel, would unleash investment in the US oil patch]{.underline}, and
it would unleash orders for new equipment and services[. When companies
invest in US shale oil, it triggers a whole chain of activities in the
real economy.]{.underline} Then [Powell touched upon the other
side]{.underline} of the coin of lower oil prices[: Consumers
pay]{.underline} less for gasoline. Conversely, they would [pay more for
gasoline when oil prices are higher]{.underline}. Consumers hate paying
more for gasoline. But here is the thing: [Whatever amount consumers
spend on gasoline is part of "Consumer Spending" which accounts for
about 70% of GDP. So, when gasoline prices rise, consumers with limited
budgets shift]{.underline} some of their spending [from]{.underline}
Walmart's [imported doodads to gasoline]{.underline}. In this scenario,
[gasoline sales would rise a lot and Walmart doodad sales would fall
some, and it would all flow into "consumer spending." But gasoline in
the US is now mostly a made-in-the-USA produc]{.underline}t (see the
trade data above, third chart), and [most of the money spent on gasoline
goes into the US economy, and stays in the US economy]{.underline}, and
is not siphoned out by OPEC or other producing countries. Imported
doodads siphon money out of the US economy (imports are a negative value
in the GDP formula). [So every dollar a consumer shifts]{.underline}
away from imported doodads to [gasoline ends up boosting the overall US
economy]{.underline} -- though it might slow China's economy a tad.
Obviously, there are dark consequences of higher gasoline prices: For
example, they may also shift dollars from things like food and
healthcare to gasoline. Higher gasoline prices make consumers surly, and
squeeze spending on discretionary things, such as movies or restaurant
meals. But they're all shifts within "consumer spending." [If the price
of WTI goes back to \$75 or \$80, there will be a flood of new
investment in the oil patch in the US. This spending would flow into
manufacturing and services. It would flow into wages. It would flow into
trucking and tech]{.underline}. It would ricochet around the US through
the multiplier effect. [Now that the US is the largest oil and natural
gas producer in the world, higher prices for these products are actually
beneficial to the overall US economy,]{.underline} just like they are
beneficial to OPEC. This is a new experience for the US.

#### China's economy is resilient- statistics and new policies prove

U.S. President Donald Trump\'s threat of imposing new tariffs on
hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars of Chinese goods is perhaps the
biggest bombshell on the global financial market this week. The Dow
plummeted by 450 points at the open after Trump\'s explosive tweet.
[Some Western media outlets are gloating over whether the Chinese
economy could survive Trump\'s potential tariff war. \"If the U.S.\'
tariffs on Chinese goods increase to 25 percent..., it will hit China
like a sucker punch --]{.underline} an unexpected, devastating blow that
will leave policymakers reeling, at least for a moment,\" Business
Insider said in its recent report. [Is it really the case? Statistics
suggest the opposite]{.underline}. [In spite of exterior blows, Chinese
economy rose by 6.4 percent in the first quarter year-on-year, beating
Reuters\' expectations of 6.3 percent. A total of 3.24 million urban
jobs were created in the same period,]{.underline} fulfilling 29.5
percent of the country\'s annual target. The rise in consumer prices in
Q1 is 0.3 percentage point lower from a year earlier. [These figures are
strong evidence of the healthy trajectory of the Chinese
economy.]{.underline} [After decades of development, the Chinese economy
is resilient enough to withstand Trump\'s potential tariff fight and
other external blows]{.underline}, Liu Chunsheng, an associate professor
at the Beijing-based Central University of Finance and Economics and
deputy dean of the Blue Source Capital Research Institute, told CGTN.
CGTN Photo [The resilience,]{.underline} according to Liu, [comes from
the following aspects. Firstly,]{.underline} as the world\'s second
largest economy, [China has a huge developmental potential and solid
material basis. Its economic scale determines that it will not be
defeated by the "sucker punch." Secondly, China has been sparing no
effort in deepening its reform and further opening up its economy to the
outside world in the past decades]{.underline}. [Earlier this month, the
Chinese government unveils plans to open its banking and insurance
sectors, allowing overseas insurances groups to set up units in
China]{.underline}. The country\'s [newly passed foreign investment law
is another breakthrough]{.underline}. [The law]{.underline}, adopted by
China\'s top legislature on March 15 and will take effect on January 1,
2020, [is the first of its kind that grants foreign investors greater
access to the Chinese market and equal treatment with their Chinese
counterparts]{.underline}. These opening-up measures [have boosted
investors\' confidence and instilled new vitality to the Chinese
economy.]{.underline} Thirdly, the improvement in China\'s economic
structure deserves applause. [While the country depended largely on
foreign trade for economic growth, domestic demands are becoming the new
ballast stone for the Chinese economy]{.underline}. Zhaochuan Iron
Factory in Heibei Province. /CGTN Photo Official [statistics suggest
that final consumption\'s contribution to GDP growth is higher than that
by the gross capital formation and net exports of goods and
services]{.underline}, standing at 65.1 percent in the first quarter.
Such an economic structure is a prerequisite to the sustainability of
economic growth. Thirdly, [China\'s macroeconomic policies to further
stabilize the markets are gradually taking effect]{.underline}. The
Chinese government [announced in March that the value-added tax on
manufacturing companies will be cut from 16 percent to 13
percent]{.underline}. [The country\'s central bank also announced
earlier this month that it will slash the reserve requirement ratio in
an attempt to lower the financing costs for small- and medium-sized
enterprises]{.underline}. [China\'s flexible monetary and fiscal
policies are supportive enough to counteract the volatilities that
external factors may bring to its economy.]{.underline} The competition
will be a major theme of the China-U.S. relationship, Liu warned. The
[Chinese government has already been taking precautionary measures to
tackle the long-term costs of Sino-U.S. trade spats. The Chinese economy
is resilient enough to withstand external blows and thus focusing on
domestic developmental issues, as Liu said, is a priority for China at
the current stage.]{.underline}

[For years, Chinese growth has dominated economic headlines across the
globe.]{.underline} Now, as the engine looks to be slowing down, [there
is a feeling of shock and the inevitable question---is the end nigh? A
selective reading of the numbers---sales of autos, phones and the
decline in imports and exports---leads one to believe that the
meltdown,]{.underline} long forecast by Western observers, [may just be
starting. A closer look, however, suggests that reports of a Chinese
implosion are **grossly exaggerated.**]{.underline} [A free economy in
the throes of an external debt trap threatens implosion. China exhibits
neither of those two symptoms]{.underline}. [The Chinese government is
not over-leveraged and also has massive foreign currency reserves.
What's more, the Communist Party and the Chinese central government are
almost synonymous, and have absolute control over the country's
resources, which in itself is a sure-shot guarantee that a sudden
calamitous collapse of the kind that led to the disintegration of the
Soviet Union is unlikely to happen. What we are witnessing is no more
than the turning of the ship with an export-focused economy finally into
a balanced one.]{.underline} [In the long term, China's growth will
increasingly be driven by its vast domestic marke]{.underline}t. In the
past, the country pushed up investment, sometimes at a great cost. Now,
[it is turning to consumption, while looking to cut down on debt. Nor
are the actual numbers good enough indicators of an alarming decline.
China is regulating its descent in much the same way that it calibrated
its rise.]{.underline} In any case, the Chinese market today is back to
the 2009 levels, which implies that if Mr Market knows all, it is giving
zero credence to the growth over the last decade. Was it even real? If
the \$20-trillion US economy growing at 3% per year is considered
kosher[, China's \$12 trillion economy growing at 6.2% shouldn't be a
cause for worry to Xi Jinping]{.underline}. The Chinese president is
worried though, and that tells the government is aware of the situation
and is determined to stay on top of it. Bloomberg reported on Monday
that Xi told a "seminar\" of top provincial leaders and ministers in
Beijing that the Communist Party needed greater efforts "to prevent and
resolve major risks\". Indeed, much of the concern about China's
slowdown may actually be stemming from its implications for the rest of
the world. [A day after China reported its weakest annual growth in the
last 28 years at 6.6%, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) cut its
global growth outlook for 2019 from the 3.7%, projected just three
months ago, to 3.5%, and for 2020, from 3.7% to 3.6%.]{.underline} The
IMF's concern, [US President Donald Trump's trade war, is also the
immediate cause of the slowdown in China's growth]{.underline}, though
the worst of it is yet to show up. Spare a thought also for countries
such as Vietnam, Australia and South Korea, whose exports are driven by
Chinese demand. As that country falters, the economies of these
countries are in serious danger of tripping. [China has a serious
economic problem, no doubt]{.underline}, and one that is not going away
any time soon. [But to imagine it will stop the **juggernaut** in its
tracks would be a **gross misreading of the numbers**. It may be better
to focus instead on the fact that the gross domestic product (GDP)
growth came in higher than expected.]{.underline}

[Whereas "renewable energy" conjures up visions of wind, solar, and
tidal power]{.underline}, "clean" energy sources that will last forever
to power the world into a "green," sustainable future[, **it won't
happen** without an Orwellian restructuring of the world's social and
economic fabric]{.underline} as envisioned by the UN's Commission on
Environment and Development more commonly known as the Bruntland
Commission. Chaired in the late 1980s by Gro Harlem Brundtland, a former
prime minister of Norway, the commission set about to advance what
appeared to be a noble and desirable cause. Its foundational report,
titled Our Common Future, stated: "Humanity has the ability to make
development sustainable in order to ensure that it meets the needs of
the present without compromising the needs of future generations." So
far, it seems pretty hard to argue with a goal like that. Unfortunately,
while it would be great if wind and solar power could accomplish this,
their potential capacities and reliabilities just aren't there. In other
words, **[none of these "renewables" offer anything remotely close to a
sustainability panacea . . . either now or likely ever]{.underline}**.
[Nuclear power, breeder reactors in particular, come much nearer to
making a real difference, yet never seem to get the same credit. As
Roger Andrews observes in his August 26 Energy Matters]{.underline}:
Environment and Policy blog, [the Brundtland Commission went on to link
sustainable development objectives to **eradicating world
poverty**]{.underline} . . . again something that sounds really good.
Its report stated: "Poverty is not only an evil in itself, but
[sustainable development requires meeting basic needs of all and
extending to all the opportunity to fulfill their aspirations for a
better life. A world in which poverty is endemic will always be prone to
ecological and other catastrophes."]{.underline} Sure, let's all agree
that poverty is a truly tragic condition. The big rub here is that
[eradicating poverty won't be accomplished by **depriving desperate
world populations of access to affordable** and buildingthegridreliable
**energy**]{.underline} --- [those who now depend upon animal dung fuel
for heating, cooking, and water purification --- people who lack
electricity essential for refrigeration to keep perishable food safe or
provide periodic lighting.]{.underline} And [that's exactly what is
happening through international lending programs that emphasize costly
and anemic "renewables" while denying vital funds needed to develop
abundant local fossil fuel resources.]{.underline} So the Bruntland
Commission offered another condition. In order to raise underdeveloped
countries out of poverty, "[Sustainable global development requires that
those who are more affluent adopt lifestyles within the planet's
ecological means --- in their use of energy,]{.underline} for example."
In other words, the solution is for rich countries to send money and
become subordinate to a U.N.-run world government [which will ensure
equal distribution of financial and natural resources.]{.underline}
Needless to say, that world government would also decide what common
lifestyle levels and ecological means are acceptable. Such decisions
must include social engineering to control optimum population size. As
Our Common Future admonishes: ["Sustainable development can only be
pursued if population size and growth are in harmony with the changing
productive potential of the ecosystem.]{.underline}

#### Renewable energy collapse the economy---stranded assets and destroys industries

**Gros et al 16** -- PhD in Economics from UChicago, Director of the
Centre for European Policy Studies

(A group of the ESRB, Advisory Scientific Committee, Chaired by: Daniel
Gros Dirk Schoenmaker Assisted by: Sini Matikainen Sam Langfield The
group included the chair and co-chairs of the ASC: Philip Lane Marco
Pagano Javier Suarez, "Too late, too sudden: Transition to a low-carbon
economy and systemic risk", No 6, February 2016)

2.1 Macroeconomic impacts of energy price shocks [A "hard landing"
transition to a low-carbon economy implies]{.underline} [constrained
energy supply and increased costs of production for the **whole
economy**, with effects equivalent to a **large and persistent negative
macroeconomic shock**.]{.underline} In the event of a hard landing, [a
rapid transition away from fossil-fuel-based energy production
would]{.underline} be necessary. This could [trigger a downward shift in
the supply of energy and an **upward shock** to energy
prices]{.underline}. Depending on advances in renewable energy
technology and energy efficiency, [substituting low-carbon for
fossil-fuel energy would be expensive at the margin]{.underline}.
Additionally, the [time-intensive adaptation of infrastructures and
generation capacity may imply energy shortages and **abnormally high
energy costs** in a transitional period]{.underline} (see Box).
[Increased energy costs would impair economic growth both on the supply
and demand side]{.underline}. [Energy-intensive sectors, particularly
transport and manufacturing, would see their production processes
disrupted as input prices increase]{.underline}. In the shorter term, a
rapid transition could result in constrained energy supply if demand
outstrips the productive capacity of renewable energy (see Box). At the
same time, [households' disposable income would be hit by the effect of
increased energy costs on the price of consumption goods]{.underline}
(most notably, electricity and transport) (Figure 2). [Economic output
depends upon the reliable supply of energy]{.underline}. [Carbon
restrictions would severely affect not only energy production
industries, but also emissions-intensive industries more generally, and
other industries relying on energy or other carbon-intensive
inputs.]{.underline}11 [Energy, transport, agriculture, and industrial
processes are particularly emissions intensive]{.underline} (see Figure
3). According to Stern (2008), the energy sector will need to be at
least 60% decarbonised by 2050 in order to stabilize emissions at the
targeted level;12 the overall costs of mitigation have been estimated in
a range of -2% to 5% of global GDP by 2050 (Stern, 2008; see also Box),
with considerable variation by industry (see Figure 4). Though these
estimates should be treated with caution given uncertainties involved in
modelling,13 [**historical analysis** of oil price shocks support the
view that **even small shocks** to the cost of energy have substantial
effects on real GDP]{.underline} (Kilian, 2014). 2.2 Financial system
exposure to stranded assets [The transition to a low-carbon economy
implies that a wide range of carbon-intensive assets would
become]{.underline} "[stranded]{.underline}" (i.e. unusable). In a
gradual transition to renewable energy and replenishment of the physical
capital stock, these assets would slowly become obsolete.
Carbon-intensive technologies would gradually become unprofitable due to
a combination of regulation (such as carbon taxes) and technological
development (i.e. economies of scale that drive down the costs of
renewable energy). In the case of a "hard landing", [the sudden arrival
of obsolescence caused by a rapid change in environmental policy might
precipitate a more **radical** and not fully anticipated repricing of
carbon-intensive assets, including fossil-fuel reserves and other assets
dependent on cheap fossil fuels]{.underline}.14 This section discusses
two types of assets that could become stranded: fossil-fuel reserves
(2.2.1) and other assets (2.2.2). 2.2.1 Financial system exposure to
fossil-fuel reserves [If substantial climate change is to be avoided, a
large quantity of fossil-fuel reserves and infrastructure is
unusable]{.underline}. McGlade and Elkins (2015) estimate that if the
rise in average global temperatures is to be kept below 2°C,
approximately 35% of current oil reserves, 50% of gas reserves and
nearly 90% of coal reserves are unusable. In addition, Lewis (2014)
estimates that [under a more stringent policy scenario]{.underline},15
[oil, gas and coal companies could lose \$28tn in revenue over the next
twenty years]{.underline}, relative to baseline projections, [due to
reduced sales]{.underline} -- an estimated 22% decrease in revenues for
the oil industry alone. The market values of the firms involved in the
extraction and processing of fossil fuels may only belatedly and
suddenly reflect changes in future revenues and the negligible scrap
value of stranded assets. Oil and gas companies represent a significant
fraction of the nonfinancial corporate sector; their global market
capitalisation is nearly \$5tn (Bloomberg New Energy Finance, 2014). In
a "hard landing" scenario, markets might suddenly reassess the value of
firms' stranded assets and future profits. HSBC (2013) estimates that
this could result in a 50% decrease in market capitalisation for oil and
gas companies, including both the risk of stranded assets and reduced
demand. Current market pricing may reflect lack of awareness of the
challenges posed by climate change as well as uncertainty regarding the
path of policy (see Box).16 [Fossil-fuel firms and electricity utilities
are substantially debt financed]{.underline}, [exacerbating the
potential financial stability impact of a sudden revaluation of stranded
assets]{.underline}. [Fossil fuel and other carbon-intensive companies
make up one-third]{.underline} [of the]{.underline} \$2.6tn
[global]{.underline} leveraged [loan market]{.underline} (PRA, 2015).
[Oil and gas companies in particular have been significantly increasing
their indebtedness]{.underline} (see Figure 5), [with the rise largely
led by the US and emerging markets and aggravated by the downward oil
price shocks of 2015-2016]{.underline} (Domanski et al, 2015).17 [A
large swing in asset prices could lead to **debt repricing and credit
losses**, aggravating the impact on financial stability.]{.underline}18
The EU financial system has significant direct exposure to fossil-fuel
firms. Though the potential effect is difficult to quantify without
better exposure data, Weyzig (2014) estimates that the exposures of
European financial institutions (including banks, pension funds and
insurers) to fossil-fuel firms exceed €1tn (see Table 1), and estimates
potential losses of between €350bn and €400bn, even under an orderly
transition scenario.19 Based on available information, the first-order
impact of financial sector losses on carbonintensive assets appears
manageable, though [the initial shock could trigger **negative feedback
loops**]{.underline}. [Even relatively small initial shocks can generate
systemic feedback loops via the interaction of financial
frictions]{.underline} (Clerc et al, 2016). [Moreover, the repricing of
carbon-intensive assets is likely to take place at the same time as
general market volatility]{.underline} (e.g. oil prices in the
commodities market).20 2.2.2 other carbon-intensive assets Avoiding
substantial climate change implies that assets dependent on fossil-fuel
energy will become obsolete. [Carbon-intensive sectors such as
transportation, manufacturing, agriculture and real estate rely on a
large stock of long-lived physical capital whose efficient use requires
a continued supply of cheap energy]{.underline} and, in many cases,
energy specifically [derived from fossil fuels]{.underline}. In a "hard
landing" transition to a low-carbon economy, [carbon-intensive physical
capital]{.underline} (such as conventional vehicles, electricity supply
infrastructure, machinery used in manufacturing processes) [would
quickly become obsolete]{.underline}. [The sudden revaluation of
carbon-intensive capital would also affect **financial institutions**
with claims on firms that]{.underline} disproportionately [own such
capital]{.underline} [or use it as an input]{.underline} in their
production processes. This includes firms that own and distribute fossil
fuels and those whose production processes directly generate emissions.
It also includes industries with a heavy reliance on inputs whose
manufacturing is emissions intensive (e.g. construction, as a user of
concrete and steel), which will also find the use of their existing
capital uneconomical. [Recent macroeconomic modelling estimates
that]{.underline}, [under a scenario in which markets revalue assets in
accordance with policy limiting warming to 2°C]{.underline}, [major
stock market indexes might fall by 15-20%]{.underline} (CISL, 2015).21
[The initial shock of this revaluation could trigger **systemically
relevant second-round effects**]{.underline}. [Contagion could extend
across the **corporate bond and leveraged loan markets**]{.underline},
partly [reflecting uncertainty as to the extent to which firms of
various sectors may be affected]{.underline} directly or indirectly [by
the initial shock]{.underline}. [If some highly leveraged financial
institutions were severely hit by initial losses, and exposures
throughout the system were opaque and unquantified, market and funding
**liquidity spirals might significantly amplify the damage** to the
financial system]{.underline} (Clerc et al, 2016).22

#### Renewables cause warming---equipment manufacturing

**Sarkar 17** (Saral, Indian-German academic and eco-socialist political
activist. Sarkar taught at the Goethe Institute as a lecturer in German,
6/27/17, "How clean is 'clean energy'? Renewables cannot solve the
global crisis",
<https://medium.com/insurge-intelligence/how-clean-is-clean-energy-why-renewables-cannot-solve-the-global-crisis-10205baeb781/>
)

Such [activists are suffering from some illusions. They appear not to
know the most inexorable of all the laws of physics, namely the Second
Law of Thermodynamics]{.underline} (AKA the Entropy Law that also
applies to matter). In reality, [so-called renewable energies are
neither renewable nor clean. One makes this mistake due to a logical
error that must be rectified. We have to differentiate between sources
of energy and equipments needed to convert them into electricity and
heat]{.underline}. [Sunshine, wind, and flowing water are sources that
will still be there after Homo sapiens has disappeared]{.underline} from
the surface of the earth and will still supply useful energies to the
next hominid species-- e.g. as driver of sailing boats and as supplier
of warmth. So they indeed are renewable and also clean. [But the
equipments needed to generate electricity from these sources are made of
materials that are nonrenewable. And the energy used to produce these
material things comes till today for the most part from fossil-carbon
and nuclear fuels]{.underline}, both of which are nonrenewable and
dirty. [So how can solar, wind and hydro-electricity be called renewable
and clean? And how can electric cars be preferable to combustion engine
cars if the batteries made of nonrenewable materials store nonrenewable
and unclean electricity]{.underline}? [Moreover, these so-called
renewable energies are not viable,]{.underline} although they are
feasible. [Suppose]{.underline} tomorrow, accepting the demand of the
movements, [all states decide to leave all the still unextracted fossil
and nuclear fuels in the ground. How will then the said equipments be
manufactured/built]{.underline}? [And the equipments that have already
been manufactured/built and are supplying electricity have a lifespan of
20--30 years. When they are no longer working and must be replaced, the
second generation thereof cannot be manufactured/built,]{.underline}
because then, we shall not have any fossil or nuclear energy to be used.
Either the fossil-carbon and nuclear fission materials are exhausted or
our governments have decided to leave them in the ground. To make the
point clear, let me quote an impatient discussant, who, using the
pseudonym "foodstuff", put the following questions to protagonists of
the so-called renewable energies: "I still want to know if the following
can be done: 1. Mine the raw materials using equipment powered by solar
panels. 2. Transport and convert metal ores, e.g. bauxite-aluminum,
using equipment run by solar panels and in a factory built using the
energy from solar panels. 3. Make the finished panels in a factory run
by solar panels, including building and maintaining the factory. 4.
Transport, install and maintain the solar panels using equipment running
on solar panels. All this is presently being done \[mainly\] with the
energy from fossil fuels. How will it be done when they are gone?"(3)
EROEI [Protagonists of 100% "renewable energies" say: we must use a
large part of the generated renewable energies for producing the
equipmen]{.underline}t needed for producing the second generation of
equipment for producing renewable energies. And so it will go on and on.
[Here comes the crucial question of EROE]{.underline}I (Energy Return on
Energy Invested or energy balance). Assuming that the first generation
equipments do produce some net energy, i.e. EROEI is positive, how large
is the amount of this net energy? Let us remember, hundreds of millions
of households and enterprises producing consumer goods will first
consume electricity from this source. Will there be anything left for
investing in production of all the equipments, i.e. producing and
reproducing everything necessary for running an industrial economy?
There is no certainty in this question. [Many experts who tried to
measure it expressed doubt that the EROEI of solar energy technology is
positive.]{.underline} Why is the matter so uncertain? The gross ER
(energy return) part of the question is easy to answer, and correctly,
if you have a good meter attached to the solar panel. But [how do you
measure the EI]{.underline} [(energy invested]{.underline}) [part of the
question]{.underline}? What the experts do is actually guesstimating.
Here bias starts playing a role. So I answer the question in a
different, and I think more convincing, way: [Since almost all raw
materials and energy that are until today used to produce the required
equipments are nonrenewable, the old mines and wells of the same
gradually get exhausted. Miners must then go to ever remoter and ever
more difficult places to extract them out of new mines/wells. That
means, energy invested (EI) in fuels and minerals progressively
increases. That means EI --- not only for energy equipments but also for
any industrial product --- continuously increases]{.underline}.
Remember, we are not talking of prices and money costs which depend on
many variable factors, but of EI, of energy cost of a product. For
example, money cost of production of solar panels would fall further,
and hence also their price, if production is transferred from China to,
say, Bangladesh, where wages are lower than in China. In case of
minerals such as copper and nickel we are digging deeper and deeper and
going to ever hotter and icy-colder deserts and polar regions. The
copper mine of Chuquicamata in Chile's Atacama desert is in the meantime
so deep that the big heavy trucks that bring the ore to the surface can
only be seen like toys down below. For oil, we are since long boring in
deep seabed. Recently, geologists have found a mountain containing huge
quantities of extremely rare cadmium telluride, the material that can
greatly increase the efficiency of solar cells. But it stands at a depth
of 1,000 meters down in the Atlantic Ocean. If that is the objective
situation, [no small innovation improving the ER side can, I think, in
the long run offset the trend of rising energy costs (EI). For such
small innovations cannot overcome the two cosmological constantsinvolved
here, namely 1. the intensity of solar radiation reaching the surface of
the earth at any particular place, and 2. the fact that the sun does not
shine in the night]{.underline}.(4)

"We have more liquid gold than any country in the world," Trump said in
his victory speech on Nov. 6. "More than Saudi Arabia. We have more than
Russia."

Ahead of Thursday's scheduled meeting of OPEC+, that creates a dilemma
for its de facto leadership in Riyadh: continue defending the price of

its current account]{.underline}. "The current account would shift to a
deficit, [mainly]{.underline} **[[reflecting declining oil

the report said.

Non-oil growth is also expected to moderate in 2024 but reach 4.4% in
the medium term. This will be supported by higher domestic demand as
more projects are implemented.

[Overall [growth will be]{.mark}]{.underline} 4.7% in 2025, [[supported

[Oil prices]{.underline} have been volatile this year, and they\'ve
[cratered into a dangerous zone that threatens profitability for
producers]{.underline}, a top energy investor said this week.

Dwight Scott, executive vice chairman of Quantum Capital Group, told
Bloomberg TV this week that at the rate [prices are]{.underline} going,
they are \"[dangerously close\" to no longer being profitable for
producers.]{.underline}

[US crude prices are down about 8% this year, trading at \$66.68
Thursday morning.]{.underline}

[\"In the mid-\$60s, you get dangerously close to where oil prices
don\'t]{.underline} really [drive appropriate returns for new
drilling]{.underline},\" he said, adding that the industry\'s rig count
has been off for the past two months, referring to the number of active
drilling rigs in one area.

In the interview on Wednesday, Scott addressed the oil industry\'s
supply and demand dynamics, laying out what he sees for the future of
the industry. President Donald [Trump\'s election was seen as a bullish
indicator for the oil]{.underline} and gas [sector]{.underline} early in
the year but so far, [prices have been subject to volatility amid
economic uncertainty and high global supply.]{.underline}

Scott added that Trump\'s drill baby drill\" mantra has mostly been
moot, as [the industry in the US has]{.underline} already [been pumping
record amounts of crude in recent years.]{.underline} That\'s part of
the reason US producers have been hesitant to keep flooding the market
with oil, as even more supply could further depress prices.

oil.\

#### Crude oil supply has continued to increase, yet demands are [dropping]{.underline}. Prices drop significantly.

Oversupply Spiral: Can Prices Stay Above \$60?; OilPrice;

The [International Energy Agency]{.underline} just threw a bucket of ice
water on oil bulls, [reporting that [crude]{.mark} [supply]{.mark} is
[**outpacing demand** by 600,000 bpd]{.mark}]{.underline} and slashing
its demand outlook for the year. And the IEA isn't alone. The world's
biggest oil traders are also sounding the alarm, turning bearish as
[[overproduction]{.mark} [ramps up]{.mark} both [inside and outside
OPEC]{.mark}]{.underline}. "The industry is over-drilling now, that is
clear," Gunvor's chairman Torbjörn Törnqvist told Bloomberg in an
interview on the sidelines of CERAWeek. "We are drilling more inside and
outside OPEC than demand growth warrants." [Indeed, production is on the
rise.]{.underline} The U.S. [[E]{.mark}nergy [I]{.mark}nformation
[A]{.mark}dministration]{.underline} said in its latest Short-Term
Energy Outlook that it [[expected]{.mark} [U.S.]{.mark} [output]{.mark}
this year to [gain]{.mark} 400,000 bpd [to]{.mark} **[13.6 million
barrels daily]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which would solidify the country's
status as top global producer---and a major reason for the weakness in
oil prices. Yet [[OPEC+]{.mark} is [also]{.mark} [producing
more]{.mark}]{.underline}, or rather, some members of the group are
producing way over their quota. In the latest update from the cartel,
[**[Kazakhstan]{.mark}** was the main overproducer]{.underline}, with an
average daily rate of 1.767 million barrels in February versus a quota
of 1.468 million barrels daily. [**[Nigeria]{.mark}** also
overproduced]{.underline}, although less dramatically, exceeding its
ceiling by some 70,000 barrels daily. Meanwhile, [on the demand
side]{.underline}, it appears that [many have concerns related to
President Donald Trump's approach to trade policy, namely
[tariffs]{.mark}]{.underline}. The concerns focus on tariffs [**hurting
[demand]{.mark}** [for crude]{.mark}]{.underline} as they make various
goods more expensive. Some tariffs might also have a negative effect on
oil and gas industry costs, specifically the steel and aluminum tariffs
the Trump administration announced earlier this week. The effect,
however, is likely to be modest. This will not be the case with refining
in the United States, where as much as 400,000 bpd in processing
capacity is scheduled to be shut down this year. Two refineries---one in
Los Angeles and another in Houston are slated for a shutdown in 2025,
which would leave more crude available on the market. According to the
chief executive of Vitol, Russell Hardy, the current developments in
supply and demand could push oil prices consistently lower, to between
\$60 and \$80 per barrel. Hardy also said that West Texas Intermediate
could dip below \$60 per barrel at some point, though likely not for
long. In fairness, [it would [not be]{.mark} the [first time when
**overdrilling**]{.mark} has [led to]{.mark} **[price dips]{.mark}**
that have served as a natural correction for excessive production
activity and there is no reason the current situation should be an
exception to that rule.]{.underline} Meanwhile, one prominent oil
analyst has said that the [[world]{.mark} has [entered]{.mark} the [era
of **peak oil trading**]{.mark}.]{.underline} According to Jeff Currie,
formerly with Goldman Sachs and currently with Carlyle, the
international oil trade peaked in 2017 and has since been on the decline
due to the rise in wind and solar electricity that is produced locally.
"The share of global energy consumption that came from fossil fuels that
crossed borders peaked in 2017, and has since declined by 5%," Currie
wrote in a note cited by Bloomberg this week. In it, the analyst noted
that while oil is a reliable source of energy, its cross-border trade is
increasingly vulnerable to developments such as Trump's tariff push, for
example. According to Currie, this vulnerability will serve as
motivation for boosting reliance on wind and solar.

#### Prices have gone down significantly -- data and overproduction proves.

One of those things is happening. [[Prices]{.mark} [at]{.mark} the
[pump]{.mark} have indeed [gone down]{.mark}, largely because the price
of [crude oil]{.mark} has [dropped]{.mark} by nearly **[25%]{.mark}**
[since]{.mark} the start of [January]{.mark}.]{.underline} West Texas
Intermediate, [the [U.S. benchmark]{.mark}, [dropped]{.mark}
[from]{.mark} a [peak]{.mark} of around [\$80 a barrel]{.mark} in
mid-January [to]{.mark} just [under **\$60**]{.mark} today]{.underline}.
But that\'s not because U.S. producers are opening the spigot. Indeed,
prices are now low enough that, on average, U.S. producers cannot
profitably drill new wells, according to the latest survey data from the
Dallas Federal Reserve. Here\'s a breakdown of the forces that are
buffeting oil prices and what it means for individuals and the economy.
Tariffs are creating economic uncertainty Sweeping tariffs have raised
concerns that trade barriers could slow down the global economy. Oil
demand is closely correlated with economic prosperity: When economies
are booming, companies are opening factories, and people are buying
things and going places, oil consumption climbs. [[When]{.mark}
[economies **slump**, so does]{.mark} oil [demand]{.mark}]{.underline}.
And although environmentalists say that oil consumption must drop if the
world is to meet climate goals, demand is still expected to rise this
year --- even with a trade war. The question is how much. Analysts at
Rystad Energy, a research company, have said that a trade war extending
through 2025 could halve the expected growth in Chinese oil demand.
Rystad\'s global head of oil commodity markets, Mukesh Sahdev, wrote
that the tariff situation is so atypical that comparing this year to
last year \"has become largely irrelevant.\" [[OPEC]{.mark}+ is
[putting]{.mark} **[more barrels]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} the
[market]{.mark} Meanwhile, [while]{.mark} there are [concerns
about]{.mark} a [drop]{.mark} [in]{.mark} oil [demand]{.mark},
[production]{.mark} is actually [set to **rise**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
The oil cartel [OPEC]{.underline} and its allies, collectively known as
OPEC+, have [made a series of announcements]{.underline} over the last
few months, [each increasing the group\'s oil production.]{.underline}
Most recently, on May 3, some members of the oil cartel that had
previously volunteered to cut their production announced that they would
unwind some of those cuts. The news immediately sent the oil market
downward; prices touched four-year lows Monday before recovering. In a
press release, [OPEC+ emphasized that its decision is based on \"current
healthy market fundamentals\"]{.underline} --- essentially, [pointing
out that [while fears]{.mark} [about]{.mark} the [future]{.mark} have
[led to **falling oil prices**]{.mark}, [demand]{.mark} today [remains
**unwavering**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Analysts think there\'s more than
that going on. OPEC+ member countries agree to production quotas; when
everyone sticks to them, it keeps supply limited and prices high. But
data shows that some of the group\'s members have been exceeding those
quotas. This is a recurring problem for OPEC+; each individual country
has an incentive to produce more, even as the group as a whole benefits
if they all produce less. Before the most recent OPEC+ gathering,
analysts at Clearview Energy Partners predicted in a note that Saudi
Arabia, the de facto leader of OPEC+, could urge the group to increase
production and bring down prices \"in an effort to pressure OPEC+ member
countries including Iraq and Kazakhstan to comply with quotas.\" And
indeed, the group did order a production increase. [Meanwhile,
[Trump]{.mark} has [explicitly]{.mark} [asked]{.mark} OPEC+ to [produce
more oil to bring down prices]{.mark}]{.underline}, although it\'s not
clear what influence that may have had.

#### They don't assume a [large enough timeframe]{.underline}. Oil prices are [at its lowest]{.underline}.

It\'s not immediately clear what\'s pushing the energy market down
today. Factors behind the broader decline include the increase of supply
from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its
allies this month for the fourth time. Higher supply means now the
market needs to see demand quickly ramp up to match a larger supply of
oil.\

### NU -- Thumpers -- Peak Oil

#### Peak oil is [coming]{.underline} now and [craters]{.underline} oil.

Trouble as Renewables Suddenly Mean They\'re Producing Way Too Much
Oil.\" Yahoo News. 6/15/2024.

Barrel of Laughs

[The **oil industry** may have a **reckoning** on the]{.underline}
horizon. [[**According** to]{.mark} a new report from [the
**I**]{.mark}nternational **[E]{.mark}**nergy **[A]{.mark}**gency, [the
**world** is headed towards a]{.mark} **ludicrous [surplus]{.mark}** [in
**oil**]{.mark} **supply** [that could see **prices**
tumble]{.mark}]{.underline} and the industry\'s position falter --- [a
**forecast** in no **small part** [attributed to]{.mark} the [**growth**
in **renewables**]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially solar.

[[This]{.mark} impending oil \"**[glut]{.mark}**]{.underline},\" as the
energy watchdog predicts, [[will come after a peak in]{.mark} global oil
[demand in 2029]{.mark}]{.underline}, plateauing at 105.6 million
barrels per day.

[With a continued drop in demand]{.underline} in the following year,
[the [**supply** will **overshoot**]{.mark} that **figure**]{.underline}
by about 8 million barrels per day --- [[a **disparity** that hasn\'t
been seen **since**]{.underline}]{.mark} the lockdowns at the height of
[the **[COVID]{.mark}**-19 pandemic]{.underline}.

\"[Such a **massive oil production** buffer could **usher** in a lower
**oil price environment**, posing **tough challenges** for **producers**
in the **U.S.**]{.underline} shale patch [and]{.underline} the
**[OPEC+]{.underline}** bloc,\" the IEA said in its annual report,
referring to the coalition of the world\'s leading oil producers that
includes Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

Striking it Poor

In advanced economies, where [**oil [demand]{.mark}** [has]{.mark}
already [been **declining** for **decades**]{.mark}]{.underline}, the
IEA estimates that it\'s set to further fall from 45.7 million barrels
per day in 2023 to 42.7 million by 2030.

On the opposite side of that equation, [[producers]{.mark} such as the
**US** and **OPEC+** members [have]{.mark} only [**ramped** up
**investments**]{.mark} in **oil**, and their **contributions** are
expected to drive production upwards]{.underline} with China and India,
both hugely expanding economies with massive populations and a growing
number of drivers, as the biggest customers.

[But [China\'s]{.mark} **economic [growth]{.mark}**, which has
[**accounted** for]{.mark} around [**60 percent** of]{.mark} the
**uptick** in global **oil [demand]{.mark}**]{.underline} for the past
decade, the IEA said, [is [expected to **slow**]{.mark} in the **coming
years**, and with it its appetite for oil.]{.underline}

Furthermore, the IEA sounds very optimistic about the impact renewables
will have. A greater adoption of electric vehicles --- of which China is
the world\'s leading manufacturer --- plus a bump in [**[solar]{.mark}
energy** [will be the]{.mark} **biggest [difference]{.mark}**
makers]{.underline}, more so than other forms of clean energy
technology.

[And we may already be seeing **signs** of that right now, with
**solar** [proving so **efficient**]{.mark} at times that [**prices**
are]{.mark} **dipping** into the **[negative]{.mark}** in **certain
markets**]{.underline}. On the other hand, EV adoption seems less like a
sure thing right now than it did a few years ago as sales falter. And so
the future remains a slick thing to grasp --- though hopefully not oil
slick.

[as]{.mark} [strong global growth in production]{.mark} of petroleum and

States issued additional sanctions targeting Russia's oil sector on
January 10, which have the potential to reduce Russia's oil exports to
the global market.

[We forecast prices will fall to an average of \$66/b in 2026 mainly
because of [**growing production** in]{.mark} [countries]{.mark} outside
OPEC+ [and demand growth]{.mark} that is [less than]{.mark} the
[pre-pandemic average]{.mark}. These factors **[reduce]{.mark}**
forecast [oil prices]{.mark} because production outpaces consumption,
increasing global **oil inventories**.]{.underline} We expect OPEC+
members to continue to restrain production in 2025 and 2026 to prevent
prices from falling further.

Ultimately, we expect lower prices will reduce drilling activity and
investment in U.S. production of crude oil and other liquids, leading to
a small increase in production in 2026.

Significant uncertainty remains in all aspects of oil supply and demand,
which will influence oil prices given any differences compared with our
forecast. OPEC+ members might change their policies as they face the
prospect of ceding further market share to countries outside of the
group. U.S. crude oil and other liquids production has been highly
sensitive to changes in crude oil prices, and a small difference in
prices with our forecast would alter the growth or decline of U.S.
production. Lastly, we forecast relatively slow growth in global oil
consumption, but changes in economic growth rates and other systemic
changes could significantly alter the trajectory compared with our
forecast.

[Since the appalling attack on Israel by Hamas terrorists on 7 October,

East have had a major impact on oil prices]{.underline}, from the price
shocks of the 1970s to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 to the
Libyan civil war in 2011, and this is prompting fears of a repeat, given
the risks of the current conflict spreading.

the Middle East to the global market -- threatening efforts by central
bankers to address high inflation."[Escalating wrath in the region will

tightening could resume, and global oil demand growth will be dented,"\
-- Tamas Varga, analyst at PVM[.]{.underline} There are also fears that
[the US may impose additional sanctions on Iran, further restricting oil
exports from the country]{.underline}. Iran is a long-standing supporter
of Hamas, and Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah, which has also
historically engaged in attacks on Israel. Over the past year, the US
has turned a blind eye to some exports of Iranian oil to countries such
as China, despite existing sanctions in relations to Iran's nuclear
programme. The reason for this relative flexibility has been a desire to
reduce upward pressure on gasoline prices, a politically sensitive topic
in the US.

[[Oil]{.mark} is [**cheaper** than]{.mark} it has been since early
[2021]{.mark}, [when]{.mark} the [price]{.mark} of a barrel of crude was
still [recovering]{.mark} [from]{.mark} its pandemic
[crash]{.mark}]{.underline}. The price of a barrel of West Texas
Intermediate started Monday morning at just under \$58 a barrel. [That
is [more]{.mark} [than]{.mark} **[twenty bucks]{.mark}**
[cheaper]{.mark} [than a year ago.]{.mark} And it is [likely to head
**even lower**]{.mark}]{.underline}: Over the weekend, the members of
OPEC+ said they will boost supply. So, yay, cheap gas, right? [[Not so
fast]{.mark}. It is possible for a barrel of oil to be too
cheap.]{.underline} In an ideal world, [[oil companies]{.mark}
[would]{.mark} [like]{.mark} a [barrel]{.mark} of crude [to sell]{.mark}
[for more than]{.mark} the **[break-even]{.mark}
[price]{.mark}**.]{.underline} "It\'s the price of oil at which oil
companies can profitably drill a well," said Mark Finley, a fellow at
Rice University's Baker Institute. Like any business, they want to make
money after taking into account all their costs. "It\'s everything from
having your corporate headquarters to buying the land, or buying the
rights to the land, lining up a drilling crew, paying for the pipe and
fracking fluid," said Finley. Every company and every drilling project
has its own break-even price. But [in general, [\$60-ish dollars]{.mark}
a barrel [is]{.mark} the **[sweet spot]{.mark}** for producing oil
onshore in the U.S. [When]{.mark} [prices]{.mark} [go below]{.mark}
that, some [companies halt production]{.mark}.]{.underline} There's some
evidence this happened briefly in early April, when prices dropped and
so did active oil rigs, said Matt Smith at the analytics firm Kpler.
"It\'s a clear signal that we hit that break even and broke through it
there, back in early April, and here we are again, testing these levels
again," said Smith. [If prices stay low, oil companies will have a
choice to make: Either invest in new production, or give back to their
investors,]{.underline} who've been demanding more consistent dividends
and share buybacks. [[Smith]{.mark} [said]{.mark} [companies]{.mark}
[will]{.mark} probably [choose]{.mark} the latter]{.underline}. "[You
want [to keep]{.mark} your [shareholders **happy**]{.mark}, [rather than
producing]{.mark} an incremental barrel of oil [which]{.mark}
[has]{.mark} [lost]{.mark} you [money]{.mark} to produce,"]{.underline}
said Smith. But while low prices may throw a wrench into new drilling
plans, they may not be too much of a threat to the overall industry,
said Amy Myers Jaffe at New York University. Because it\'s consolidated
a lot in recent years, and bigger firms are better able to weather a bad
market. "I think that it would take a much more prolonged and much lower
price to get a shakeout than it has in the past," said Jaffe. If the
economy falls into a recession, Jaffe said, while [tariffs **drive up**
the cost of steel and other materials oil drillers need, then the
industry could feel more of a pinch.]{.underline}

https://apricum-group.com/is-there-a-link-between-oil-prices-and-renewable-energy-development-in-gcc-countries/?cn-reloaded=1&cn-reloaded=1\]

There are reasons to believe [the tie between oil prices and the path
forward for renewable energy is weakening]{.underline}. A combination of
[geographical advantages, national priorities, and the threat of climate
change makes the expansion of renewable energy inevitable.]{.underline}

[The GCC region is blessed with both renewable energy potential on par
with its natural resources underground.]{.underline} GCC countries are
among the [highest solar irradiated countries in the world]{.underline}
(with an average theoretical potential of up to 6 kWh/m2/day\[2\]) with
low seasonal effects. This in turn translates into a record low cost for
solar electricity. The story is not very different for wind potential.
The southern shores of [Oman and]{.underline} the western regions of
Sau[di Arabia are home to wind speeds equal to those found in northern
Europe]{.underline} -- exceeding 1,000 W/m2 average power density at
100m altitude\[3\]. Finally, [the region's access to water enables it to
plan giga-scale green hydrogen projects]{.underline} to leverage its
abundant renewable resources and hydrocarbon know-how to provide clean
fuel to global demand centers. [The region is optimally located to
benefit from renewable resources and make use of cheap abundant solar
and wind power over fossil fuel-based conventional electricity
generation.]{.underline}

It is well known that [oil-rich countries are preparing to diversify
their economies away from being solely dependent on oil
revenues.]{.underline} One prominent example is the Vision2030 by Saudi
Arabia: the Kingdom not only plans to support large-scale renewable
energy projects but also aims to flourish its local renewable energy
industry by producing equipment and services throughout the value chain
via localization requirements. The role of renewable energy in
diversification is also evident in the investments made by the sovereign
investment funds of the region[. PIF of Saudi Arabia, ADIA and ICD of
UAE, and QIA of Qatar all have made several investments in the cleantech
industry.]{.underline}

With the next two COP meetings being hosted in MENA (2022 Egypt and 2023
UAE), [many of the countries in the region have revealed decarbonization
pledges as well as ambitious renewable energy targets]{.underline}.
October 2021 witnessed the announcement of [net-zero targets by 2050
from UAE and by 2060 from Saudi Arabia and Bahrain]{.underline}
authorities. [UAE and Saudi Arabia have also announced plans to source
50% of their electricity from clean energy sources.]{.underline}
Continuous multi-hundred megawatt-scale renewable energy auctions and
signed power purchase agreements, even during low oil price periods,
show that [the outlook of renewable energy in the region is bright
regardless of oil prices.]{.underline}

#### No link---renewables don't replace fossil fuels

**Jansen, 23** \[Malte Jansen is a Lecturer in Energy and Sustainability

\"Renewables are cheaper than ever yet fossil fuel use is still growing
-- here's why\" Conversation, 9-19-2023; accessed 7-14-2025
https://theconversation.com/renewables-are-cheaper-than-ever-yet-fossil-fuel-use-is-still-growing-heres-why-213428\]

Wind and solar are the world's fastest growing energy sources and
together generated 12% of global electricity in 2023. The amount of
energy produced by wind and solar is expected to increase and
accelerate.

Wind generated 1 terawatt (TW) for the first time in 2023 -- nearly as
much as the total installed energy capacity of the US (1.2 TW). Solar
broke this threshold in 2022.

So why in the first global stocktake of the world's progress towards
limiting warming to 1.5°C did the UN say we're still not phasing out
fossil fuels fast enough?

Asia's economic growth powered by coal

[Despite]{.underline} the [rapid growth of renewable
energy]{.underline}, the most carbon-intensive forms of electricity
generation, using [coal and natural gas, have risen by 22% and 37% since
2010]{.underline}, respectively. [Coal and gas power generation is still
the **backbone** of global energy systems and these fuels are likely to
remain **dominant** for **decades** to come.]{.underline} Nonetheless,
the phase-out of coal (arguably the dirtiest of fossil fuels) is gaining
momentum.

During the past decade, the number of new coal power plants built each
year has fallen fast. Global coal demand has continued to fall even as
the war in Ukraine strained gas supplies.

In the most prosperous OECD countries (or Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development), virtually no new coal plants are planned
or being built, though new coal mines are still being approved. This is
a result of national policies such as the UK's decision to ban coal in
power generation from October 2024.

\[Figure 1 Omitted\]

The US has retired many ageing coal plants since the mid-2010s due to
the low price of shale gas. The country's coal fleet will continue to
shrink as 99% of coal projects are more expensive than new clean energy,
thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

Increasingly cheap renewables are finally biting into fossil generation
in the US. Rawpixel.com/Shutterstock

This picture is very different in Asia. Here, countries have relied
heavily on cheap coal to fuel their economies. This is particularly true
in China. After adding 27 gigawatts (GW) from coal in 2022 alone, China
by itself is offsetting the retirement of coal plants elsewhere in the
world.

But there are some signs this is changing. The global pipeline for new
coal power plants is smaller than ever and China and India both pledged
to "phase down coal" in 2021 at the Glasgow climate summit.

So, [rapidly increasing renewable energy hasn't cut coal and gas
consumption at the same rate because **humankind is using a lot more
electricity** than we used to,]{.underline} especially in Asia. In the
last 20 years, the use of electricity in Europe and North America has
remained largely constant.

Here, renewable energy has slowly eaten into the proportion of energy
generated by fossil fuels, while all other energy sources (nuclear,
hydro, biomass) have remained about the same. In Asia, [electricity
demand has **tripled** since the 2000s, with the **bulk** of this energy
coming **from fossil fuels.**]{.underline}

#### Renewables don't displace fossil fuels---endowments, application, and availability explain replacement better

**Montalbano, 25** \[Sarah Montalbano is an energy policy fellow at the
Center of the American Experiment, a StateBeat fellow with Young Voices,
and a senior fellow with IWF. She was formerly the Policy Manager at
Alaska Policy Forum and the Northwest Regional Leader and writer with

Study Finds\" Independent Women\'s Forum, 5-27-2025; accessed 7-16-2025
https://www.iwf.org/2025/05/27/more-renewables-dont-mean-less-oil-gas-and-coal-study-finds/\]

A new [research brief]{.underline} in the Journal of Environmental
Studies and Sciences [finds **no association** between renewable energy
production and fossil fuel production]{.underline} in 33 states. [The
study aimed to discern if renewable energy displaces fossil
fuels.]{.underline}

The study is behind a paywall, but an article on Phys.org about the
study indicates [that the data set spanned from 1997 to
2020]{.underline} and covered 33 states "that produce fossil fuels in
the U.S." The [production of renewable energy in a state **did not lower
or replace** the production of traditional thermal
generation]{.underline}. The [data set was]{.underline} state-level [per
capita production of]{.underline} coal, natural gas, and [crude
oil,]{.underline} as well as per capita energy production from
geothermal, conventional hydroelectric, solar, wind, wood and waste, and
biofuels.

Additionally, the author found that [96% of the variation in traditional
thermal generation was explained by fixed factors in each state, such as
**endowments** and the geologically **available deposits.**]{.underline}

The author, assistant professor of rural sociology at Penn State, Ryan
Thombs, advocates for more direct curbing of fossil fuel production,
including policies "that directly limit fossil fuel production through
carbon taxes, setting production caps on fossil fuels and keeping fossil
fuel reserves in the ground." He also says that "many policies to this
point assume that growth in renewable energy corresponds with a
proportional decrease in fossil fuels." The author's footnotes
acknowledge that "solar and wind do face a limitation in that humans
cannot control how windy or sunny it is, whereas there is a definitive
resource supply of fossil fuels."

There may be many reasons for this. [Oil, gas, and coal have important
reliability attributes for the electric grid: they]{.underline} can be
ramped up and ramped down as needed ([dispatchable), they are
baseload]{.underline} (can generate steady, predictable amounts), [and
operate 24/7. Thermal resources also have applications where
**renewables simply cannot substitute** with electricity, including
transportation, industrial processes, and heating.]{.underline} While
outfitting passenger vehicles with batteries is becoming mainstream,
[airplanes cannot carry enough batteries to become
all-electric.]{.underline} Many [states]{.underline}, like Alaska and
North Dakota, also [rely heavily on their natural resources for jobs,
tax revenue, and economic growth.]{.underline}

Another explanation is that re[newable energy adds intermittent,
weather-dependent energy at the margins and, instead of displacing other
sources, leads to more energy consumption overall.]{.underline} More
electricity and energy is an unabashedly good thing, especially when, as
Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in March remarks at CERAWeek, "over 2
billion people today cook their daily meals and heat their homes burning
wood."

More energy means growing access to modern living standards around the
world. U.S. oil, gas, and coal are indispensable.

#### Renewables statistically don't reduce fossil fuel production

**Kimani, 25** \[Alex Kimani is a veteran finance writer, investor,
engineer and researcher for Safehaven.com. \"Study: Expanding Renewable
Energy Does Not Lower Fossil Fuel Production\" OilPrice, 05-21-2025;
accessed 7-18-2025
https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Study-Expanding-Renewable-Energy-Does-Not-Lower-Fossil-Fuel-Production.html\]

A new study has found that [increasing renewable energy may not
necessarily reduce fossil fuel production in the United
States]{.underline}. Published in the Journal of Environmental Studies
and Sciences, [the study found no correlation between the production of
fossil fuels and renewable energy]{.underline}, suggesting that
[producing more renewable energy does not]{.underline} automatically
[mean that fossil fuel production will decline.]{.underline}

Ryan Thombs, the author of the study, analyzed data spanning 1997 to
2020 from the 33 American states that produce fossil fuels. Thombs,
however, found that [more than 96% of the variation in fossil fuel
production trends across the states depended on factors such as
available deposits in each state.]{.underline}

According to Thombs, additional policies may be required if the United
States is to lower its reliance on fossil fuels, with the ongoing myth
that [ramping up renewable energy investments naturally leads to less
fossil fuel production **debunked**.]{.underline}

\"Policies could include ones that directly limit fossil fuel production
through carbon taxes, setting production caps on fossil fuels and
keeping fossil fuel reserves in the ground,\" he said. \"Future research
could consider other geographical contexts to see if the findings from
this study are generalizable elsewhere and should also consider the
effectiveness of specific policies that have been implemented.\"

According to the United Nations, fossil fuels account for almost 90% of
carbon dioxide emissions and more than 75% of greenhouse gas emissions.
Transitioning away from fossil fuels to renewable energy fossil fuels is
frequently touted as the best way to mitigate climate change.

### Oil Not Key -- General

#### Middle east countries are moving away from oil reliant economies and now are starting to move to towards renewables.

Accessed 07/18/2025\] EH

[The global oil market's dynamics are shifting. The global shift towards
renewable energy, motivated by environmental concerns]{.underline} and
the competitiveness of renewables, impacts the demand for Middle Eastern
oil. The emergence of new energy producers, like the U.S. shale
industry, further challenges Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries' (OPEC) dominance, pushing the region towards strategic
adaptations in its energy and economic policies. [Innovations in
renewable energy technologies and energy storage are making alternatives
to fossil fuels more viable. This shift not only reduces the Middle
East's global market influence but also necessitates a strategic pivot
towards non-oil sectors and clean energy.]{.underline} In response to
the pressing need for change, [Middle Eastern countries are making
strategic shifts and significant adaptations, targeting economic
diversification, renewable energy development]{.underline}, and enhanced
regional cooperation to build resilience against the challenges posed by
the evolving global energy landscape. Nations are investing in sectors
like tourism, technology, and [finance to create a more sustainable
economic foundation and diversify from oil dependency]{.underline}. For
instance, Vision 2030 [ Additionally, leveraging the region's optimal
conditions for solar and wind energy, the UAE's solar farm and Saudi
Arabia's 2.6 GW Al Shuaiba solar plant are expected to start operations
in 2025.]{.underline} These initiatives are not only aimed at reducing
carbon emissions but also at positioning [the Middle East as a leader in
the global transition to renewable energy. Investment in technological
innovation is key to these strategic shifts]{.underline}. Countries are
focusing on developing local capacities in green technologies, such as
carbon capture and storage (CCS) and green hydrogen production, to lead
in the future energy market[. These strategic shifts and adaptations
underscore the Middle East's proactive approach to addressing its unique
challenges and opportunities in the context of the global energy
transition.]{.underline}

#### **Oil prices dropping barely affects Saudi**

[Oil prices have sunk and foreign investors are not buying into Saudi
Arabia's grandiose megaprojects, but the kingdom doesn't appear to be
sweating it.]{.underline}

In fact, [Saudi Arabia is telling oil industry insiders that it can live
with low energy prices]{.underline}, according to Reuters.

One reason that's true is because Saudi Arabia is, for now, in a
position many would envy, experts say.

The fact is, the Gulf kingdom can spend a lot more money than it makes.

[Saudi Arabia is trying to wean its economy off relying on energy
revenue]{.underline}, after all, that is the idea behind mega-projects
like Neom. But for now, oil still accounts for roughly 61 percent of
Saudi Arabia's revenue, according to its 2025 budget.

Oil prices have sunk and foreign investors are not buying into Saudi
Arabia's grandiose megaprojects, but the kingdom doesn't appear to be
sweating it.

Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states are some of the few in the world
whose governments' revenues are so tied to energy prices. [That is why
when analysts and experts write about the kingdom's finances, they often
use a term called the "break-even oil point" - the level Saudi Arabia
would need oil to be at to neither run a budget deficit nor a
surplus]{.underline}.

According to Oxford Analytica, [Saudi Arabia needs an oil price of over
\$100 per barrel to balance its budget in 2025]{.underline} when
factoring in spending by the kingdom's Public Investment Fund (PIF) on
megaprojects.

[But that line, often repeated in analysis and news articles, needs
unpacking]{.underline}, some experts say.

"[Saudi Arabia doesn't need to balance its budget]{.underline}," Ellen
Wald, the founder of the energy consulting firm Transversal Consulting,
and the author of Saudi Inc., told Middle East Eye.

["The idea that Saudi Arabia needs a certain dollar per barrel to
balance its budget doesn't really explain the new Saudi mindset when it
comes to oil pricing]{.underline}," Wald said.

Budget deficits

[Saudi Arabia is fine running budget deficits. The kingdom's 2025 budget
expects a fiscal deficit of \$27bn or 2.3 percent of GDP]{.underline}.

According to a report published in April by the Arab Gulf States
Institute, [if oil prices were to average \$65 per barrel in 2025, the
deficit would likely be around \$56bn or 5.2 percent of
GDP.]{.underline} Analysts say that is probably ok with Riyadh, too, for
now.

[Oil prices have been knocked down by concerns that US President Donald
Trump's tariffs could upend the global economy. The chances of an
Iranian nuclear deal freeing Iran's oil from US sanctions could also hit
prices.]{.underline}

Brent, the international benchmark, was trading down 1.2 percent on
Friday at \$61.40 per barrel.

Running a big budget deficit can be a drag on a country's finances. For
example, Trump campaigned on promising to reduce the US's current 6.5
percent deficit to three percent. In the past months, some experts have
issued near-apocalyptic warnings about the US budget deficit.

But the US is unique in the world because the dollar is the world's
reserve currency, which analysts say has given presidents on both sides
of the American political aisle a safety valve for profligate ways.

[Saudi Arabia is not the US, but experts say it has space to run
deficits, too.]{.underline}

[S&P Global Ratings this month raised Saudi Arabia's credit rating to
A+, which puts it on par with China and Japan.]{.underline}

[Saudi Arabia also has an attractive war chest. It boasts foreign
reserves of more than \$430bn.]{.underline} It has a debt-to-GDP ratio
of just 30 percent, well below that of other emerging markets.

Saudi debt deluge

To plug its short-term financing needs, Saudi Arabia is unleashing a
deluge of debt.

In 2024, Saudi Arabia advanced above China as the most active issuer of
international debt in emerging markets. Analysts say this trend is going
to continue into 2025.

[The kingdom has already issued more than \$14bn of debt in dollars and
Euros this year, and it could be on track to double that number before
the end of the year]{.underline}, according to the Arab Gulf States
Institute's visiting scholar, Tim Callen.

"Given Saudi Arabia still has a strong fiscal position, financing a
larger deficit will not be a problem," Callen wrote last month.
"Although in a lower oil price environment, it is likely that lenders
will require a higher interest rate to buy the debt than they did
earlier this year."

Wald put it another way to MEE: "The Saudis would prefer not to be in
debt, but many people are. The new Saudi Arabia can take on debt."

The linkage between military presence and America's interest in oil
price is not obvious. [**Oil** is a **fungible commodity**]{.underline},
not a resource to be "controlled." [Access to oil]{.underline}, then,
[is not determined by]{.underline} being [the **dominant
power**]{.underline} in the Middle
East.[78](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09636412.2021.1885727) Despite
the fact that US imports of Middle Eastern oil are falling, the United
States still has an interest in Gulf oil in the sense that it affects
the overall global supply, though that resource and the associated
interest are gradually declining. Rather, the best oil-related argument
for staying in MENA is about indirect effects. America, its allies in
other parts of the world, and its broader economic order remain subject
to price changes that result from any alteration in global supply and
demand, and which, in theory, could be disrupted by regional conflict or
by a hostile hegemon manipulating supply.

There are more efficient and cost-effective ways to secure those
interests than alliances and military presence,
however.[79](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09636412.2021.1885727) The
most efficient way to source oil is simply to buy it from whoever (a)
has it to sell and (b) needs the revenue, be they Saudi, Iranian, or
Texan. Yes, supply shocks can inflate prices---a conflict between major
vendors, such as a Saudi--Iranian war, would certainly do so---but not
obviously by enough to justify a limitless military commitment to its
attempted prevention (given the huge opportunity costs and uncertain
benefits of such an effort).

[The **hydrocarbon market** itself is **changing** and
becoming]{.underline} more **[resilient]{.underline}**,
[meanwhile]{.underline}.[80](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09636412.2021.1885727) Western
[economic exposure to oil shocks is **reducing**, thanks to **increases
in efficiency**]{.underline}. [These increases come from **several
factors**, including]{.underline} the development of North **[American
shale]{.underline}**, other [stocks becoming]{.underline} increasingly
**[accessible]{.underline}** through improving extraction technologies,
[better-managed shipping]{.underline} routes/fleets, [and the capacity
to call on]{.underline} public/private [inventories and the
redistributing function of the I]{.underline}nternational
[E]{.underline}nergy [A]{.underline}gency. Spare capacity and strategic
petroleum reserves are also now better used to moderate supply shocks.
The United States already has adaptive mechanisms, apart from security
guarantees and bases, that it can use to mitigate disruptions. Indeed,
[in **every oil shock** since 1973]{.underline}, [these mechanisms have
been used]{.underline}, increasing production from other
sources.[81](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09636412.2021.1885727) And
such market evolutions simultaneously diminish supply manipulation's
utility as a coercive lever, both for OPEC as a whole and for major
vendors therein. Even the 1973 oil embargo crisis was created not
primarily by the drop in production, which only fell by 2--4%, but by
the Nixon administration's imposition of price
controls.[82](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09636412.2021.1885727) [**Large-scale
disruptions** to oil markets]{.underline}---for instance, the Iran--Iraq
War of the 1980s---historically [led to **rapid third-party
adaptation**]{.underline},
meanwhile.[83](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09636412.2021.1885727) As
Justin Logan observes, "[a major disruption in one
location]{.underline}, temporarily reducing global supply and raising
prices, [incentivizes **producers elsewhere**]{.underline} to increase
oil
production."[84](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09636412.2021.1885727)

[Further developments also]{.underline} create [increased
resilience]{.underline}, [such as the development of **spot and futures
markets**]{.underline} that enable consumers to hedge risks, as opposed
to the reliance on long-term contracts. And with [electric]{.underline}
vehicle [sales projected to surpass oil]{.underline}-powered vehicles
[within the next two decades]{.underline}, [and various synthetic fuels
in development]{.underline}, [the value of the resource itself may
wane]{.underline}.[85](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09636412.2021.1885727) The
2020 **[coronavirus]{.underline}**-induced [collapse]{.underline} in oil
demand [could also move from **temporary shock** to **permanent
reduction**]{.underline} if certain associated traits, such as the
internet-enabled expansion of remote working, become the new normal,
further reducing the perceived need for Western presence to "guard" Gulf
hydrocarbons.

### Saudi Resilient

#### Saudi Arabia's [resilient]{.underline}\-\--growth is driven by their [non-oil economy]{.underline}.

[[**Even as** oil]{.mark} production [cuts **eat** into Saudi
Arabia's]{.mark} top-line [GDP]{.mark}, the [country remains one of the
**most buoyant emerging markets**]{.mark} in 2024, [supported
by]{.mark}]{.underline} ongoing [growth in its burgeoning **[non-oil
economy]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The [country's]{.underline} social **[transformation]{.underline}** ---
which began in earnest eight years ago [with]{.underline} the launch of
the **[[Vision 2030]{.underline}]{.mark}** programme [by]{.underline}
Crown Prince **[M]{.underline}**ohammed **[b]{.underline}**in

the [[country's]{.underline}]{.mark} economic [[growth
**beyond**]{.mark} its]{.underline} long-established [[hydrocarbon
sector]{.mark}, creating **jobs**]{.underline} for a rapidly expanding
local workforce.

Yet while **[[lower oil prices]{.underline}]{.mark}** and regional
geopolitical risks [[have]{.underline}]{.mark} had [**[little
impact]{.mark}** on non-oil business sentiment]{.underline} thus far,
questions remain about the capacity of the government to follow through
on a growing list of headline-grabbing gigaprojects --- to which the
Fifa World Cup of 2034 is expected to be added shortly --- especially as
it struggles to attract foreign direct investment.

After a surge in oil revenues following Russia's full-scale invasion of
Ukraine made Saudi Arabia the best-performing economy in the G20 in
2022, last year saw the country sink close to the bottom of the table.
[Oil production cuts introduced in October 2022]{.underline} by Saudi
Arabia and the Opec+ bloc and deepened the following April [saw the
country's oil economy contract by **9 per cent** in
**2023**]{.underline}, prompting a 0.8 per cent fall in overall GDP.

The cuts --- aimed at shoring up prices amid weak global demand --- are
set to expire in June at time of writing, with production expected to
rise again to protect market share in the face of expanding US oil
production.

Yet while a similar move 10 years ago saw a dramatic production increase
and a slump in prices, more gradual action is expected this time around.

"When production rates increase we're unlikely to see the same sharp
rises that we saw in 2014, as Saudi Arabia and other Opec+ members
aren't going to want to see prices fall as far as they did then," says
James Swanston, a Middle East and north Africa economist at Capital
Economics.

Yet [[while Capital Economics]{.underline}]{.mark} still
[[predicts]{.mark} a **4.5 per cent [contraction]{.mark}** [in]{.mark}
the **[oil economy]{.mark}**]{.underline} this year even as production
ramps up, [[**overall GDP** is forecast to improve]{.mark} to 2.8 per
cent [on the back of]{.mark} the country's **burgeoning [non-oil
economy]{.mark}**. The sector grew by 4.4 per cent in 2023]{.underline},
with Capital Economics forecasting 4.8 per cent growth this year.

Vision becoming reality

The story of the transformation of Saudi Arabia's non-oil economy under
Vision 2030 is by now a familiar one. Its milestones --- the lifting of
the ban on cinemas and women drivers, the sale of shares in state oil
company Saudi Aramco, the launch of several domestic gigaprojects,
[[heavy state investment in **economic
diversification**]{.underline}]{.mark} initiatives and the dramatic rise
in domestic employment --- [are]{.underline} still [worthy of
note]{.underline}.

The Impact of Saudi Vision 2030 on Procurement

As Saudi Arabia moves toward realizing Vision 2030, procurement will
play a pivotal role in achieving these goals. Here's how procurement is
being reshaped in line with the Kingdom's ambitious objectives:

[1. Focus on Local Sourcing]{.underline}

[One]{.underline} of the most significant [shift]{.underline}s under
Vision 2030 [is the emphasis on boosting local industries and reducing
dependency on imports.]{.underline}

[By sourcing more products and services locally, Saudi Arabia aims to
foster economic growth, create job opportunities, and develop domestic
capabilities across various sectors.]{.underline}

For procurement professionals, this shift means that organizations will
need to re-evaluate their supply chains. Building relationships with
local suppliers, contractors, and manufacturers will be critical.

[This]{.underline} not only [supports the economy]{.underline} but also
helps in ensuring that businesses comply with the regulations designed
to stimulate domestic production [and reduce reliance on foreign
goods.]{.underline}

How Procurement Will Adapt:

[Procurement will adapt by assessing supply chains to identify local
sourcing opportunities, ensuring a stronger and more sustainable supply
network. Local suppliers will be preferred over international bids.
Investing in initiatives that support the development of local suppliers
will foster long-term partnerships and economic growth.]{.underline}
Additionally, staying up to date with government mandates and sourcing
regulations will ensure compliance and strategic alignment with national
objectives.

Eng. Salem Bafaraj, Vice President of In-Country Value & Industrial
Development and Mona Ahmed Balalaa, Manager of Market & Ecosystem
Development at ADNOC recently explored how new local sourcing
requirements impact procurement teams in the MENA region. They shared
key challenges and best practices and how ADNOC managed to forge strong
and lasting relationships with local suppliers. Watch the entire
roundtable discussion to learn more about challenges and best practices.

[2. Digitalization and Technological Advancements]{.underline}

[Technology and digital transformation are core]{.underline} to Saudi
Arabia's Vision 2030. The Saudi government is focusing on modernizing
its infrastructure, utilizing data analytics, and integrating smart
technologies across industries. For procurement[, this means moving away
from legacy systems and adopting digital tools to enhance efficiency,
transparency, and accuracy.]{.underline}

From e-procurement platforms to blockchain for supply chain
transparency[, the future of procurement in Saudi Arabia will be shaped
by advanced technology. Businesses that leverage digital procurement
tools will be able to streamline their processes, reduce costs, and gain
better visibility into supplier performance.]{.underline}

How Procurement Will Adapt:

[Investing in digital procurement solutions such as agentic AI sourcing
tools and AI-driven analytics will make teams more
efficient.]{.underline}

[Moving towards e-procurement platforms will unlock local suppliers,
enhance transparency and reduce administrative overhead.]{.underline}

[The use of powerful data analytics tools will help make smarter,
data-driven decisions allowing for an AI-powered user
experience..]{.underline}

[3. Sustainable Procurement]{.underline}

Sustainability is central to Vision 2030's long-term goals[. The Kingdom
is already facing rising temperatures forcing diversification of energy
sources, reducing carbon emissions, and building a green
economy.]{.underline}

As a result, procurement professionals will need to prioritize
sustainable sourcing practices and select suppliers who adhere to
environmental standards.

This shift towards sustainable procurement will impact policies, with
more organizations looking for environmentally conscious suppliers who
can provide eco-friendly products and services. Over time, these
alternative energy sources will enable new revenue streams, such as
foreign data embassies.

[For procurement, this means integrating sustainability into the entire
supply chain, from material sourcing to logistics.]{.underline}

How Procurement Will Adapt:

[Incorporate sustainability criteria into supplier selection and
evaluation processes.]{.underline}

[Prioritize eco-friendly products, materials, and packaging in
procurement decisions.]{.underline}

[Collaborate with suppliers to promote sustainable practices in the
supply chain.]{.underline}

[Using specialized tools can help manage Value Chain Emissions and drive
sustainable Supply Chains]{.underline}

[Sustainability is already reshaping procurement across the Middle
East]{.underline} and there are numerous tools and services at
procurement's disposal to help drive decarbonization in supply chains
for example:

Driving Sustainable Procurement: Tools and Services for Supplier
Assessment and Collaboration

[4. Increased Transparency and Governance]{.underline}

[5. Capacity Building and Talent Development]{.underline}

Vision 2030 also places a strong emphasis on the development of local
talent. [As the Kingdom diversifies its economy, the demand for skilled
professionals in various sectors, including procurement, will increase.
Saudi Arabia aims to equip its workforce with the skills necessary to
succeed in a rapidly evolving job market.]{.underline}

How Procurement Will Adapt:

For procurement professionals, this means a shift towards continuous
professional development. [Organizations must invest in training their
procurement teams to navigate new digital tools including AI powered
technologies, adapt to local sourcing policies, and ensure compliance
with sustainability and governance regulations.]{.underline} Partnering
with universities and other educational institutions to foster a skilled
workforce in procurement and supply chain management can help fill
knowledge gaps.

Conclusion -- The Critical Role of Procurement

Saudi Arabia's [Vision 2030 is a monumental step towards economic
transformation and modernization.]{.underline} As procurement is a
critical enabler of this transformation, procurement professionals must
stay ahead by embracing local sourcing, digital tools, sustainability,
and good governance practices.

By aligning procurement strategies with the vision's objectives,
[businesses can contribute to Saudi Arabia's long-term success while
positioning themselves for growth in this new era of economic
diversification.]{.underline}

contributed to proxy conflicts and power struggles between competing
rising powers in the Middle East. Layla is a research assistant with USC

Hoover. (Layla MoheyEldin, 02/28/2023, "What Saudi Vision 2030 Means For
The Future of Oil-Dependent Economies", Glimpse from the Globe,
https://www.glimpsefromtheglobe.com/features/analysis/what-saudi-vision-2030-means-for-the-future-of-oil-dependent-economies/)

[Saudi Vision 2030 is an initiative conceptualized]{.underline} and led
by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman [to distance the Saudi economy
from its reliance on oil --- and by extent, dependence on foreign
trading partners --- and diversify the economy.]{.underline} [Bin Salman
is attempting to lead the country into the future and away from what he
termed "a case of oil addiction."]{.underline} The initiative was
introduced in April 2016, with components such as the establishment of
an e-government system, the creation of a Saudi tourism industry and
allowing women to drive.

The creation of this project was spurred by the steep decrease in crude
oil prices in the summer of 2014, resulting in a state budget deficit of
almost \$100 billion in 2015, with the Vision released the following
year.

Saudi Arabia, like most HOCs in the Middle East, is a rentier state,
with a significant portion of its income relying on revenues from the
sale of oil to outside sources. The primary goal of the Vision was to
reduce Saudi economic dependency on foreign entities.

[The Saudi Vision 2030 is built around three themes: a vibrant society,
a thriving economy and an ambitious nation. One component of the Vision
is the National Transformation Plan (NTP), which was implemented from
2016-2020 and aimed to boost non-oil revenue to \$141 billion. The plan
was successful, creating almost half a million non-government jobs,
transforming 24 government agencies such as the Ministry of Investment
to increase efficiency and ease of foreign participation, as well as
furthering bin Salman's drive toward the secularization of the Saudi
government. At the end of 2022, Saudi Arabia reported its first budget
surplus in almost a decade, thanks in large part to the results of this
plan.]{.underline}

Another component of the Vision that has gained widespread attention and
apprehension is NEOM, a planned smart city with a budget of \$500
billion to be built in northern Saudi Arabia's Takbuk province, on the
coast of the Gulf of Aqaba. NEOM stands for New Future, combining the
Greek word neos, meaning new, and the Arabic word mustaqbal, meaning
future.

The smart city has faced skepticism over its feasibility, but if
successful would diversify the Saudi economy through tourism, similar to
the restructuring of tourism industries in Gulf countries such as Qatar
and the UAE.

Part of NEOM, The Line, began construction in October of 2022. The Line
is a futuristic sustainable city that is planned to revolutionize urban
living by running on 100% renewable energy. It will accommodate 9
million residents within 34 square kilometers, which is unheard of
compared to other cities of a similar capacity. [The initiative's focus
on sustainability is driven by the desire to base the Saudi economy on
ventures that --- unlike the oil that has built Saudi Arabia --- are not
finite, investing in Saudi Arabia's long-term future while appealing to
foreign investment in their economy.]{.underline}

[Part of the vibrant economy pillar of the Vision is a \$2 trillion
transformation fund aiming to reduce unemployment, increase female
participation in the workforce, boost the role of the private sector in
GDP, increase the localization of oil and gas sectors and increase
foreign direct investment from 3.8% of GDP to the international level of
5.7%.]{.underline}

The Vision is not the first of its kind in the region, with projects
such as UAE Vision 2021 and Abu Dhabi Vision 2030 which share similar
objectives of social reform through economic diversification.

In the case of UAE Vision 2021, the objective of transforming the
federation of states economically, politically, and socially to become
"among the best countries in the world" was successfully completed over
the decade since it launched. Saudi Vision 2030 mimics the methods used
by the UAE of attracting foreign investors and integrating itself into
the global tourism industry, expanding the international appeal of what
is portrayed to be the technologically advanced ultra-wealthy utopia of
the UAE.

The oil boom in the Middle East really began after the end of WWII, when
HOCs in the region began producing oil on a large scale and resulting in
immense revenues flowing into economically underdeveloped nations.
Although it would be reasonably assumed that these economic inflows from
high oil demand would lead to rapid growth, these countries were not
equipped to ensure they benefited most effectively from the oil wealth.

[Oil-dependent economies in the Middle East began to develop symptoms of
the "resource curse," which is a paradoxical situation where a country
possesses an abundance of valuable natural resources but underperforms
in terms of economic development.]{.underline} One clear example of this
is Saudi Arabia, where the Saudi royal family is the richest in the
world with an estimated \$1.4 trillion in oil wealth, while 20% of the
country's population lives in poverty.

Because the oil in Saudi Arabia and many other Middle Eastern HOCs is
under private ownership, usually by the monarch and their family, there
has been little to no oversight of the management of oil revenues or
requirements for their use in public endeavors.

However, revenues from oil were used somewhat throughout the Gulf
countries for domestic development, and throughout the 1950s and 1960s
the societies of countries such as the UAE and Qatar were completely
transformed. The effect oil has had on the Middle East cannot be
understated. Life expectancy increased in Saudi Arabia from 40 in 1950
to 75 in 2022. Transportation and sewer systems were built, quality of
life improved astronomically and infrastructure projects have continued
over the decades.

Through the Vision's economic reforms, Saudi Arabia has already enacted
"sin taxes," with a 100% excise tax on energy drinks and tobacco, and a
15% value-added tax on almost all goods and services. This is in
addition to taxing the private sector and landowners, and removing
subsidies and stipends, although currently personal income is not taxed
for Saudi citizens. Before the Vision, the government had never directly
taxed its citizens, [but the goal of these reforms is to increase
reliance on domestic revenue to finance Saudi Arabia instead of external
funding.]{.underline}

When a nation's government utilizes taxation, this comes with the
expectation of the country's citizens of social pillars, such as
infrastructure and government representation. When a state does not have
to tax its citizens for financial support, this frees the government
from any perceived social responsibility, creating a lack of
accountability.

However, now that taxation has been implemented within Saudi Arabia in
ways that affect its citizens, it would have been expected that the
Saudis would protest for greater political participation. There was a
trend on Twitter in 2020 shortly after further tax increases of posting
pictures of the late King Abdullah, the former monarch who passed away
in January of 2015, who was well-known for his concern for the poor.
However, thus far, King Salman and the Crown Prince have managed any
objections to the taxation by increasing social freedoms while also
increasing repression.

This taxation is occurring as the nation is moving away from providing
the plethora of public services previously funded by oil revenues.
Citizens are paying the government more money for less social
infrastructure, reaping fewer of the government-subsidized benefits they
had enjoyed for the last 50 years.

[As more of Saudi Arabia's wealth is generated domestically as a result
of the Vision, Saudi Arabia's susceptibility to the whims and ulterior
motives of foreign governments may decrease as the nation becomes more
reliant on apolitical private sector foreign direct investment in the
future.]{.underline}

[Over the six years that the Vision has been enacted there has been
measurable social and economic success: the share of women in the labor
market has increased to 37% from 17% in 2016, tourism increased by 4
billion visitors between 2017 and 2019, and foreign direct investment
increased from \$1.42 billion in 2017 to \$5.4 billion in
2020.]{.underline}

[The Vision's approach to ensure Saudi Arabia's survival is having
profound impacts on Saudi society and domestic governance. If
successful, it could provide a model for other oil-dependent countries
attempting to find their way into a future without the very resource
that built their economies, ushering in an era of unprecedented
political and social independence from the influence of foreign powers
in the Gulf and profoundly transforming the political makeup of these
societies.]{.underline}

and International Relations, Summer 2016, "Russia in the Middle East:
Back to a "Grand Strategy" -- or Enforcing Multilateralism?"

[[**In contrast** to]{.underline}]{.mark} the 20th century and [[the
early]{.mark} years of the [21st century, the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[regional [crisis in the 2010s]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[developed]{.underline}]{.mark} at a time [[when]{.underline}]{.mark},
overall, [[the **role and leverage of major powers** external to the
Middle East, as]{.underline}]{.mark} either [active [meddlers or
security guarantors]{.mark}]{.underline} in the region, or both,
actually [**[declined]{.mark} rather than increased**. The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [serves as the most evident
case in point]{.underline}: the "post-interventionist" US administration
has clearly become "tired of the Middle East", struggling and often
failing to keep pace with the dynamically changing situation and unable
to alter or decisively affect the course of events. [The same even more
strongly applies to the European powers]{.underline}. In terms of
activity and impact, **[regional actors]{.underline}** (Iran, Saudi
Arabia, Qatar, UAE and Turkey) increasingly [appeared to outplay
external powers and influence]{.underline}.

For external powers, however, that did not remove a number of risks and
threats connected to, or emanating from, the Middle East. The increase
and diversification of global energy supply and the latest crisis in
energy prices made the region less central to the global economy than it
had been in the past. At the same time, the fundamental socio-political,
statehood and security crisis in the Middle East brought with it new
security concerns and implications. They mostly stemmed from reinforced
perceptions about the long-term nature of regional instability, the
continuing potential for further destabilization, and the related
consequences and implications beyond the region, ranging from terrorist
connections to migration flows. These challenges affect external powers
unevenly. For instance, the role of the Iraq-Syria area as the main
focal point for global terrorism activity and magnet for transnational
flows of violent extremists in the mid-2010s poses a threat to everyone
(but mostly to the countries of the region itself, as well as to those
in Europe and Eurasia). In contrast, the avalanche of refugee and
migrant flows from the Middle East primarily targets Europe (rather than
North America, Eurasia, or other regions).

Until recently, [[the main]{.underline}]{.mark} type of
[[response]{.mark} by key]{.underline} (Western) [external powers to
turbulent developments in the Middle East]{.underline}, while not
amounting to a hands-off approach, [[boils down to **limited
containment**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Examples range from limited air
strikes against "Islamic State" positions in Iraq and Syria, carried out
by the US-led coalition since 2014, to the 2013 deal on Syria's chemical
disarmament co-brokered by the United States and Russia. Not
surprisingly, this limited-containment approach has had equally limited
results for Syria, Iraq and the region -- as well as for the West itself
(as shown, e.g., by the persistent migrant flows and accelerating
terrorist attacks in Europe). [[Despite the]{.mark} growing [centrality
of the Middle East to global politics]{.mark} and security]{.underline},
and its more direct impact on and ties to the West, [[this **damage
limitation** course]{.mark} taken by key external actors [has not
been]{.mark} very [different from]{.mark}]{.underline}, e.g., [[the
approach]{.mark} taken [by the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates and its Western allies (and also by
[[Russia and China]{.mark}) [to]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[Afghanistan]{.underline}]{.mark} problem in recent years.

One theme of the present moment is that [countries in the [Middle
East]{.mark} are [making **deals** based on]{.mark} their **[own]{.mark}
national [interests]{.mark}** rather than dancing to the **tune of
outsiders**.]{.underline} This independence is paradoxically because of
great power rivalry in the region, not despite it. [With **heightened
rivalry** between great powers, [regional powers]{.mark} have **more
options** and are [acting]{.mark} more [as **free agents**]{.mark} than
committed **allies** of **global powers**]{.underline}

For example, [[**Israel** and **Saudi**]{.mark} **Arabia** are
[showing]{.mark} considerable **[independence]{.mark}** from
the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[[on]{.underline}]{.mark} issues ranging from [**[energy]{.mark}

**[Ukraine]{.underline}**. **[Iran]{.underline}**, in the context of its

feeling more **confident**.]{.underline}

Moreover, [while the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is **not withdrawing** from the [Middle
East]{.mark}, its allies]{.underline} in the Persian Gulf [have come to
**[question]{.mark}** its \[[US]{.mark}\] **[reliability]{.mark}** as a
security **guarantor** and **partner**.]{.underline} [This
is]{.underline} having the effect of [drawing them **closer**
to]{.underline}, not further away from, [Iran.]{.underline} The final
straw for Saudi Arabia was the 2019 drone attacks on two oil refineries,
Abqaiq and Khurais, owned by state company Aramco. These attacks were
widely believed to be Tehran's work, yet U.S. President Donald Trump's
administration did very little to respond despite its ongoing bluster
toward Iran. For the Saudis, the Carter Doctrine, formulated in 1980 as
a U.S. commitment to use force to defend its national interests in the
Persian Gulf, had expired. This development no doubt propelled the
Saudis towards amenability to negotiation with Iran. And by 2021, the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Oman, too, were in full swing to broaden
their dialogues with Iran.

[There has been a **belief** in Washington that the Middle East can't
stabilize **without** U.S. involvement. But in the **current

De-escalate", Orion Policy Institute,
https://orionpolicy.org/gulf-arab-states-need-israel-and-iran-to-de-escalate/)

Riyadh and Abu Dhabi have spent the past few years approaching Iran
through dialogue and diplomacy, as opposed to confrontation. [Seeking to
limit and manage their tensions with Iran, rather than escalate them,
the leadership in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have
embraced strategies aimed at "de-risking" relations with Iran in the
interest of promoting more peace and stability in the Gulf.]{.underline}
This is a notable shift from the start of Trump's first term, when
Riyadh and Abu Dhabi lobbied the White House to subject Iran to "maximum
pressure" and hailed the decision to unilaterally pull the US out of the
2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in May 2018.

Their perspectives on the first Trump administration's "maximum
pressure" agenda changed as a result of the missile and drone attacks
against Saudi Aramco's energy infrastructure in September 2019 and the
sabotage off the UAE's east coast a few months earlier. Those episodes
were wake-up calls for GCC policymakers. These strikes and explosions
drove home the stark reality that their countries are squarely in the
crosshairs when Iran decides to strike back at those aligned with US-led
campaigns to isolate and pressure Tehran. Iran's loud and clear message
was that proximity to Washington's "maximum pressure" agenda comes with
a price.

[All countries in the neighborhood understand that if the Islamic
Republic views them as facilitating any foreign attack on Iran, they
stand to be targets of deadly retaliation carried out by Tehran or
Iran-aligned non-state actors in the region.]{.underline} The GCC states
are fully aware of how vulnerable they would be to any Iranian missile
or drone operations against them, and therefore the Gulf Arab monarchies
are determined to signal to Tehran that they will not be complicit in
any Israeli and/or American attacks on Iran. Notably[, the US did not
carry out its military strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities on June 22
from any bases in GCC states.]{.underline}

[Saudi Arabia and the UAE's détente with Iran]{.underline}, combined
with growing anger across the Arab world toward Israel in the
post-October 7 environment, [help explain why all the Gulf Arab
monarchies quickly]{.underline} condemned Tel Aviv's "Operation Rising
Lion" on June 13 and [called for restraint, diplomacy, and
de-escalation]{.underline}. While Oman and Qatar would have probably
reacted this way to an Israeli assault on Iran at any point in recent
history, [the responses from Saudi Arabia and the UAE speak to new
realities in the Gulf that greatly contrast from previous
times]{.underline} when Riyadh and Abu Dhabi urged the US to bomb Iran.

This is not to suggest that Saudi Arabia and the UAE's leaders cease to
perceive a serious Iranian threat, as they most definitely do. Yet,
[Riyadh and Abu Dhabi have chosen to try to protect their countries from
it through more dialogue with Iran and certain concessions to the
Islamic Republic, which, for its part, has also embraced the opportunity
to improve its relations with all GCC states as part of Tehran's
"Neighbors First" foreign policy strategy.]{.underline}

### AT: Draw In

#### Middle Eastern Conflict Does Not Bring In Other Powers

**Khatib 25** -- (Lina Khatib, 06/19/2025, "Iran\'s Self-Inflicted
Isolation", AOL,
https://www.aol.com/irans-self-inflicted-isolation-102944047.html)

Blindness [also led Tehran to overestimate its friendship with Russia
and China]{.underline}. Tehran saw Moscow as an ally when it intervened
to prop up Syria's Assad regime in 2015. But [Russia saw instead an
opportunity to grow its influence in that country]{.underline},
consolidate its military presence on the Mediterranean, [and stand up to
the West]{.underline}. Iran and China, for their part, struck a 25-year
cooperation deal in 2021. But [what Tehran viewed as rising global sway,
China saw as a limited economic pact.]{.underline} Beijing subsequently
stalled the agreement's delivery.

Today, [neither Russia nor China will come to Iran's
rescue]{.underline}. [Beijing has always avoided getting involved in
Middle East conflicts, and remains focused on its Indo-Pacific backyard.
Moscow is bogged down in Ukraine and is prioritizing the yearslong
conflict there, which has only escalated in recent months.]{.underline}

[Nor will Iran's proxies save it]{.underline}. Israel has decapitated
[Hezbollah]{.underline}'s leadership and destroyed much of its missile
arsenal, and the group [would lose much of its remaining domestic
support if it drags Lebanon into another war]{.underline}. The scale of
the Houthis' remaining arsenal in Yemen remains a mystery, following a
monthslong campaign of U.S. airstrikes, but [they are constrained by
de-escalation deals with Washington and Riyadh.]{.underline} Most of the
Iran-backed [Iraqi factions are also choosing self-preservation over
involvement in an unwinnable battle with Israel and the
U.S]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [Syria has turned from a fertile ground to
a hostile one for Iran and its assets, after the Assad regime was
toppled in December.]{.underline}

Israel has framed its war on Iran as a boost to regional and global
stability. Both the U.S. and Israel want the mission achieved. And while
the [Arab Gulf states]{.underline} have pursued rapprochement in recent
years with Iran, and [are calling for de-escalation]{.underline}, that
is largely a symbolic gesture. [They will ultimately not stand in the
way of a new Middle East and a weakened Iran. The regime]{.underline},
it seems, may be taking its last breaths, and [has no one to turn
to.]{.underline}

### AT: Oil Lash Out

#### Low prices don't cause a lash-out\-\--[theoretical and empirical]{.underline} support

**Hayes 15** \[Dave Hayes; PhD, Assistant Professor of International
Relations at Troy University; 1-14-2015; Low Oil Prices and Conflict;
Troy;
http://irblog.blogspot.com/2015/01/low-oil-prices-and-conflict.html;
Accessed 7-18-2025; RS\]

Last week, I wrote about the drop in oil prices from purely an economic
point of view and, in October, I briefly commented on the effect lower
prices would have on Putin\'s regime in Russia; but what about oil
prices from a more purely IR point of view? What effect, if any, can we
expect on the behavior of states in the international system? Rob
[Nikolewski]{.underline} at Watchdog.org [raises this
concern]{.underline} in an article entitled Will crashing oil prices
make Russia, Iran and Venezuela more dangerous? The gist of this article
is [that low oil prices are hurting Russia, Iran, and Venezuela and,
therefore, their leaders may lash out at the world]{.underline}.
[However]{.underline}, most of the substantive analysis is an assessment
of how much these countries are hurt by lower oil prices, and [very
little analysis focuses on the motives and strategic calculations of
their leadership that would support concerns about them \"lashing
out]{.underline}.\" Indeed, one is left with the impression that
Nikolewski thinks the proposition that one can expect aggression from
these leaders when they are under pressure needs little more examination
than a quote from an expert or two. [This might fly with]{.underline}
the [conservative]{.underline} [readership]{.underline} of Watchdog.org
**[but, as IR scholars]{.underline}** (and here I am addressing my
students), **[we should be more critical]{.underline}** in our reading.
We should look at Nikolewski\'s piece and note that he spends too much
time on the suppositional part of his argument (i.e., that lower oil
prices are hurting Russia, Iran, and Venezuela) and far too little on
the more causal part of his argument (i.e., that this economic pain will
encourage more aggression internationally). [This]{.underline} is turn
[should get us thinking about what the price reaction of the Russian,
Iranian, and Venezuelan leadership may actually be]{.underline}. With
apologies for another Rex Stout reference, Nero Wolfe frequently tells
his assistant, Archie Goodwin to proceed [based on \"intelligence guided
by experience.\"]{.underline} For our purposes, these twin pillars of
intelligence and experience can be interpreted to mean
[theory]{.underline} (which is logical inference and deduction [based on
a model of underlying causal relationships) and empirical research
(which is the study of past behavior of states]{.underline}). Taking the
second one first,Cullen Hendrix shares some results from his empirical
research in a Monkey Cage post entitled Falling oil prices, more peace?
As is typical of scholarly (read, with admitted bias, as \"good\")
empirical research, Cullen starts with some theory, specifically Thomas
Friedman\'s First Law of Petropolitics, which Friedman defines as
follows: The price of oil and the pace of freedom always move in
opposite directions in oil-rich petrolist states. According to the First
Law of Petropolitics, the higher the average global crude oil price
rises, the more free speech, free press, free and fair elections, an
independent judiciary, the rule of law, and independent political
parties are eroded. And these negative trends are reinforced by the fact
that the higher the price goes, the less petrolist leaders are sensitive
to what the world thinks or says about them. Conversely, according to
the First Law of Petropolitics, the lower the price of oil, the more
petrolist countries are forced to move toward a political system and a
society that is more transparent, more sensitive to opposition voices,
and more focused on building the legal and educational structures that
will maximize their people's ability, both men's and women's, to
compete, start new companies, and attract investments from abroad. [The
lower the price of crude oil falls, the more petrolist leaders are
sensitive to what outside forces think of them]{.underline}. The last
line of the preceding passage is most suggestive in that it suggests
that, [when oil prices are low, the leaders of oil exporting states will
actually be **more constrained by international pressure** than when oil
prices are high. In other words]{.underline}, contrary to what
Nikolweski implies, [the leadership of Russian, Iran, and Venezuela may
be **less likely** to lash out due to the current low oil
prices]{.underline}. In his working paper for the Peterson Institute,
Hendrix puts this idea to the test, as his abstract very succinctly
describes: Anecdotal evidence suggests high oil prices embolden leaders
in oil-rich states to pursue more aggressive foreign policies.This
article tests the conjecture in [a sample of 153 countries for the time
period 1947--2001]{.underline}. It [finds strong evidence of a
contingent effect of oil prices on interstate disputes, with high oil
prices associated with significant increases in dispute behavior among
oil-exporting states, while having either a negative or null effect on
dispute behavior in nonexporting states]{.underline}. Thus, Hendrix\'s
**[research suggests that high, not low, prices encourage more
aggressive behavior]{.underline}** (the lashing out that Nikolewski is
concerned about) **[on the part of oil exporting]{.underline}** states.
It should be pointed out that Hendrix finds only weak evidence to
suggest that low prices (below \$33/barrel) make oil exporting states
more pacific than non-exporting states, so we have to see this as a
somewhat one-way relationship. That is, [high prices promote more
aggressive behavior among oil exporting states and lower prices will not
promote such particular behavior]{.underline}. [So, empirical
research]{.underline} (the systematic study of experience, if you will)
[not only casts doubt on]{.underline} Nikolewski\'s [concerns, but
paints an entirely different picture of the effect of low oil prices on
state behavior]{.underline}. We could leave it there but, sometimes,
when confronted with an article that tweak\'s one critical thinking as
Nikolewski\'s does, there may not be an empirical study so on point as
Hedrix\'s at hand. In such a case, one needs to resort to theory to
examine the question in mind. Hendrix started with Thomas Friedman\'s
First Law of Petropolitics and I generously categorized this as theory.
However, a law is technically not a theory but rather an observed
empirical regularity, and Friedman is not a theorist but rather a
journalist. Indeed, nothing marks the difference between a journalist
and scholar so much as Friedman\'s inexact use of the term \"law\" in
that the term should be used only after an exhaustive empirical study
(as opposed to the more anecdotal evidence Friedman depends upon) has
established it Perhaps [a better theoretical foundation
would]{.underline} have [be]{.underline}en to use a theory that explains
the conflict behavior of national leaders [based on political economy
factors]{.underline}. Obviously, Realism is out here as it focuses on
system level variables, but my old stand-by of Selectorate Theory
clearly applies (and I never miss a chance to pass out the Kool-aid).
While Selectorate Theory focuses on the differences in behavior of large
versus small coalition regime leaders, [it can be applied here since oil
exporting states are typicaly small coalition, or non-democratic,
regimes]{.underline}. Back in July, I wrote about Selectorate Theory\'s
predictions about the war making decisions of democratic versus
non-democratic leaders (dictators for short). I described the prediction
of Selectorate Theory about the war making decisions of dictators as
follows: In a small coalition regime, the leader (call him a dictator)
survives in office with the support of a small coalition of supporters.
Because they are small in number, the dictator can best ensure their
loyalty by providing them with private benefits. As a result, the
leader\'s survival depends not on his job performance as a national
leader, but on his ability to keep the flow of private benefits to
supporters going. [As long as the private benefits flow to the leader\'s
essential supporters, the leader is free to do whatever he wants with
regard to policy, including the prosecution of a war. However, the
leader will have only the resources he has left over after paying off
his supporters to devote to the war effort]{.underline}. I have added
emphasis to the last sentence because it points to an important
consideration for dictators who depend on oil revenue to pay private
benefits to supporters. [When the price of oil is high, the dictator
will have more money left over after paying off his/her supporters than
when prices are low. Therefore, the leader will have more resources with
which to conduct wars]{.underline}, or any other policy, [when oil
prices are high than when they are low. Therefore, we should see more
aggression when the leader has excess resources to carry it out than
when the leader is scrambling to find enough money to pay off
supporters]{.underline}. More importantly, [even if a leader may be more
**inclined** to be internationally aggressive when oil prices are low,
the leader will have **less resources** to act on the
inclination]{.underline}. Indeed, [to the extent that the leaders of
Russia, Iran, and Venezuela depend on smaller rather than larger
coalitions of supporters, they can be expected to focus on keeping the
private benefits flowing to key supporters more than on international
adventurism. This is because the leader\'s domestic political survival
is at stake]{.underline} and the theory assumes that this overrides
other considerations. Of course, this assumption is supported by the
argument that, if leaders don\'t act to ensure their survival, then they
will be far less likely to survive in office. In short, [we shouldn\'t
theoretically expect low oil prices to make the leaders of oil
exporting, small- coalition regimes lash out internationally. Given that
most oil exporting states have small coalition regimes, this lines up
well with Hendrix\'s empirical finding that oil exporters are less
dispute oriented when oil prices are low than when they are
high]{.underline}. As Nero Wolfe would say, this reveals Nikolewski\'s
concerns to be fatuous.

## High Prices Bad

### 2AC -- China Turn

#### High oil prices cause Chinese energy instability and economic collapse---their economy is in transition now which proves the brink

**IISS 18** (International Institute for Strategic Studies, An
international research institute that provides objective information on
military, geopolitical and geo-economic developments that could lead to
conflict, "Winners and Losers from Higher Oil Prices" Strategic Survey

[As the world's largest importer of oil, China's energy-security
concerns will also come to the fore]{.underline} and shape its policy
response. China accounts for almost 10% of global oil consumption: in
April 2018, China imported around 9.6m b/d at a cost of US\$768m per
day, or US\$280bn per year. [Low oil prices]{.underline} in 2014--17
[have helped to boost consumer spending, lower the cost of doing
business and support growth]{.underline}. **[Higher energy prices could
reverse these trends, hit Chinese manufacturers and dampen private
consumption, which would complicate Beijing's plan to transition China's
economy away from an investment-led model and towards a service- and
consumption-led growth model]{.underline}**. [As such]{.underline}, and
in the face of mounting risks from US tariff escalation, [China's
determination to continue buying Iranian oil, fill the demand gap left
by Japan and South Korea, and benefit from highly discounted Iranian oil
prices will only grow stronger.]{.underline} Whether this could come at
the expense of other rival producers, namely Russia and Saudi Arabia,
remains to be seen. Driven by the need to lock in as cheap a price as
possible, China will use its buying power to encourage competition among
suppliers to its own advantage. A recent decision by Sinopec, China's
largest state-run refiner, to reduce purchases from Saudi Arabia as the
latter raised its prices is a case in point. Moreover, renewed episodes
of sanctions will reinforce China's focus on reducing its vulnerability
to oil-price volatility, including through investing in the
electric-vehicles industry, among others.

#### Chinese economic decline causes CCP collapse

[The "China collapse theory" was popular]{.underline} in the
international community [10 years ago]{.underline}. [However, with China
becoming the **world's second-largest economy** and exerting a growing
international influence, despite the chorus of doom, such **talk has
died down**.]{.underline} Yet, taking the long view, [2018
is]{.underline} shaping up to be [a **turning point** for
China]{.underline}. Today [the country faces serious **internal** and
**external** **challenges**, and is in the midst of a social
transformation]{.underline}. Given the Chinese government's ability to
maintain stability, the transformation is unlikely to be a radical,
dramatic rupture. Rather, the change may be cumulative. Like the
proverbial frog in a pot of water that's gradually brought to a boil, by
the time people realise a transformation has happened, it will already
be in place. Looking at the changes that have quietly taken place in
Chinese society this year, it is obvious that a transformation is
gestating. Firstly, [people's trust in the authorities has fallen to
freezing point]{.underline}, whatever their political leaning. The
recent Changsheng vaccine scandal illustrates this development.
Substandard vaccines directly affect the health and safety of children.
When a government cannot even guarantee children's basic safety, public
trust in government is an unaffordable luxury. Food and drug safety
scandals are not new in China. What's different this time is that
people's expectations of the government have changed. For five years,
the current government has led a robust campaign to root out corruption
in the government and party. Although it has yet to bring tangible
improvements in people's livelihoods, it nevertheless raised
expectations that it could at least ensure a safer, more secure life for
most. This was its promise. However, [the Changsheng scandal made clear
that more than five years of the most severe social controls could not
even get a vaccine problem under control]{.underline}. The Chinese
people, especially growing children, still live in an unsafe
environment. So why do they need this unprecedented level of social
regulation? [**Public antipathy** has grown more
widespread]{.underline}. [After similar scandals]{.underline} in the
past, [the far left in Chinese society would typically voice their
unconditional support for the authorities]{.underline}. [This time, most
have maintained a rare silence]{.underline}, even if they have not
directly criticised the government. [When the public condemns the
authorities in unison]{.underline}, when even the most basic trust is
lost, [it is a sign that a regime has lost its legitimacy]{.underline}.
For this to happen when the authorities are trying to forge a "new era",
**[alarm bells should ring]{.underline}**. Secondly, [the Chinese
governance system has lost its ability to perceive and respond to social
discontent]{.underline}. Individuals within the government, including
high-ranking officials, are aware of the maladies afflicting society, of
people's discontent, and of the desperate need for a cure -- to scrape
the poison off the bone, so to speak. But as an organisation, the
government appears to have lost this sensitivity. It has become very
slow to react to public dissatisfaction, much less respond effectively.
[In game theory]{.underline}, [this is]{.underline} explained by [the
"prisoner's dilemma",]{.underline} in which rational [individuals who
make decisions for their own benefit collectively lead to a poorer
outcome for all]{.underline}, including themselves. And an organisation
that allows this to happen will have failed as a system. In China's
case, [the polarisation of the leadership in recent years, leading to a
high concentration of power in the hands of one person, has exacerbated
the problem of the follow-the-leader phenomenon]{.underline} that
existed in the past. Information is not properly disseminated within the
system, and most officials become passive and just wait for orders from
their superior. Take the vaccine scandal. Even after news of the
irregularities led to a public outcry, local authorities were still
sitting on their hands. The highest leader of the land had to give
instructions for action before the government machinery jumped to tackle
the problem, holding meetings and launching investigations. [After 40
years of economic reforms, Chinese society has amassed too many
contradictions]{.underline}. Public dissatisfaction with the authorities
is well known. Even the most desensitised person could feel it. Yet the
government appears insensitive to it. Because the bureaucrats in the
system don't want to take responsibility, all they can do is push the
responsibility to others. **[System-wide, inertia
dominates.]{.underline}** If this inability to effectively respond to
social grievances persists, the system will slowly lose all its
vitality. Thirdly, [the **economic impact of the trade war** with the
United States is likely to **exacerbate the crisis** in Chinese
society]{.underline}. So far, the [tariffs]{.underline} imposed on
Chinese goods [have caused China's **stock and currency** markets to
**fluctuate** and **public pessimism** to spread]{.underline}. [Even
after the initial shock]{.underline} wears off, [the tariffs' **impact**
on China's employment, prices and financial system will be **very
real.**]{.underline} Depending on how the conflict develops, [we may see
large-scale business closures, a rise in unemployment and serious
inflation.]{.underline} **[If the economy sinks into a
recession]{.underline}**, [living standards]{.underline} may [fall
sharply]{.underline}. Since reforms began, there have been highs and
lows in the Chinese growth story. Western sanctions imposed after
China's crackdown on the pro-democracy protests of June 1989 led to some
hardships, but people tolerated them. The difficult days of the Cultural
Revolution were not so far behind then, and living standards weren't
high to begin with. **[Things are different now.]{.underline}** Many of
those born in the 1970s and after have not gone through the poverty
their forefathers experienced. [If living standards fall sharply for
them and their family because of the trade war, how will they adapt and
will there be a chain reaction? Some scholars have warned that the
**trade war** might **trigger** an **eruption** of **public
anger.**]{.underline} Chinese society is poised for change. For the
authorities, 2018 will be a big test of their ability to govern. Whether
they pass or fail, one thing is clear: an overall restlessness is
appearing in society and people are crying out for changes to the
system. Without such changes, the government leadership will only be
able to delay the outbreak of a crisis if they handle the situation well
under the current constraints, or they will accelerate the
transformation if they mishandle the situation.

#### CCP collapse causes nuclear war in the SCS

**Cole 14** --- J. Michael Cole, editor and chief of
www.thinking-taiwan.com, a web site operated by the Thinking Taiwan
Foundation---an educational foundation, former analyst at the Canadian
Security Intelligence Service, 2014 ("Where Would Beijing Use External
Distractions?" *The Diplomat*, July 10^th^, Available Online at
<http://thediplomat.com/2014/07/where-would-beijing-use-external-distractions/>,)

[Throughout history, embattled governments have **often resorted to
external distractions to tap into a restive population's nationalist
sentiment** and thereby release, or redirect, pressures that otherwise
could have been turned against those in power. Authoritarian regimes in
particular, which deny their citizens the right to punish the
authorities through]{.underline} retributive democracy --- that is,
[elections --- have used this device to ensure their survival during
periods of domestic upheaval or financial crisis. Would the Chinese
Communist Party (CCP), whose **legitimacy is so contingent on social
stability** and economic **growth**, go down the same path if it felt
that its hold on power were threatened by domestic instability? Building
on the premise that the many]{.underline} contradictions that are
[inherent to the extraordinarily complex Chinese experiment, and rampant
corruption that undermines stability, will eventually catch up with the
CCP, **we can legitimately ask how, and where, Beijing could manufacture
external crises with opponents against whom nationalist fervor**, a
major characteristic of contemporary China, can be channeled. In past
decades, the CCP has on several occasions tapped into public outrage to
distract a disgruntled population, often by encouraging]{.underline}
(and when necessary containing) [protests against external opponents,
namely Japan and the United States.]{.underline} While serving as a
convenient outlet, domestic protests, even when they turned violent
(e.g., attacks on Japanese manufacturers), were about as far as the CCP
would allow. This self-imposed restraint, which was prevalent during the
1980s, 1990s and 2000s, was a function both of China's focus on building
its economy (contingent on stable relations with its neighbors) and
perceived military weakness. Since then, China has established itself as
the world's second-largest economy and now deploys, thanks to more than
a decade of double-digit defense budget growth, a first-rate modern
military. [Those impressive achievements have, however, fueled Chinese
nationalism, which has increasingly approached the dangerous zone of
hubris. For many, China is now a rightful regional hegemon demanding
respect, which if denied can --- and should --- be met with threats, if
not the application of force. While it might be tempting to attribute
China's recent assertiveness in the South and East China Seas to the
emergence of Xi Jinping, Xi alone cannot make all the decisions;
nationalism is a component that cannot be dissociated from this new
phase in Chinese expressions of its power.]{.underline} As then-Chinese
foreign minister Yang Jiechi is said to have told his counterparts at a
tense regional forum in Hanoi in 2010, "There is one basic difference
among us. China is a big state and you are smaller countries." [This
newfound assertiveness within its backyard thus makes it more feasible
that**, in times of serious trouble at home, the Chinese leadership
could seek to deflect potentially destabilizing anger by exploiting some
external distraction.**]{.underline} Doing so is always a calculated
risk, and sometimes the gambit fails, as Slobodan Milosevic learned the
hard way when he tapped into the furies of nationalism to appease
mounting public discontent with his bungled economic policies. For an
external distraction to achieve its objective (that is, taking attention
away from domestic issues by redirecting anger at an outside actor), it
must not result in failure or military defeat. In other words, except
for the most extreme circumstances, such as the imminent collapse of a
regime, the decision to externalize a domestic crisis is a rational one:
adventurism must be certain to achieve success, which in turn will
translate into political gains for the embattled regime. Risk-taking is
therefore proportional to the seriousness of the destabilizing forces
within. Rule No. 1 for External Distractions: [**The greater the
domestic instability, the more risks a regime will be willing to take**,
given that the scope and, above all, the symbolism of the victory in an
external scenario must also be greater.]{.underline} With this in mind,
we can then ask which external distraction scenarios would Beijing be
the most likely to turn to should domestic disturbances compel it to do
so. That is not to say that anything like this will happen anytime soon.
It is nevertheless not unreasonable to imagine such a possibility. [The
intensifying crackdown on critics of the CCP, the detention of lawyers,
journalists and activists, unrest in Xinjiang, random acts of terrorism,
accrued censorship --- all point to growing instability]{.underline}.
What follows is a very succinct (and by no means exhaustive) list of
disputes, in descending order of likelihood, which Beijing could use for
external distraction. 1. South China Sea [The **South China Sea**, an
area where China is embroiled in several territorial disputes with
smaller claimants, **is ripe for exploitation as an external
distraction. Nationalist sentiment, along with the sense that the entire
body of water is part of China's indivisible territory and therefore a
"core interest,"** are sufficient enough to foster a will to fight
should some "incident," timed to counter unrest back home, force China
to react.]{.underline} Barring a U.S. intervention, which for the time
being seems unlikely, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has both the
numerical and qualitative advantage against any would be opponent or
combination thereof. [The Philippines and Vietnam, two countries which
have skirmished with China in recent years, are the likeliest candidates
for external distractions, as the costs of a brief conflict would be low
and the likelihood of military success fairly high. **For a quick
popularity boost and low-risk distraction, these opponents would best
serve Beijing's interests**.]{.underline}

everyone. 1. What does it mean for global growth? The impact will vary.

accelerate inflation. **As the world's biggest importer of oil, China is
vulnerable**, and many countries in Europe also rely on imported energy.

Hemisphere summer approaching, consumers can switch energy sources and
scale back usage. [A slowing world economy will also hurt demand and by
extension keep a lid on prices.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Renewables/Transition Turn

#### Price collapse and transition away from fossil fuels are [inevitable]{.underline} -- locking in an earlier transition [makes up]{.underline} for initial losses.

**Watts '21** \[Jonathan Watts; Guardian's global environment editor;
11-4-2021; \"Half world's fossil fuel assets could become worthless by
2036 in net zero transition\"; Guardian;
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2021/nov/04/fossil-fuel-assets-worthless-2036-net-zero-transition;
accessed 7-18-2024 RS\]

About [half of the **world's fossil fuel assets will be worthless by
2036** under a net zero transition]{.underline}, according to research.
[**Countries that are slow to decarbonise will suffer** but early movers
will profit; the study finds that renewables and freed-up investment
will more than make up for the losses to the global
economy.]{.underline} It highlights the risk [of producing far more oil
and gas than required for future demand, which is estimated to leave
\$11tn-\$14tn]{.underline} (£8.1tn-£10.3tn) [in so-called stranded
assets -- infrastructure, property and investments where the value has
fallen so steeply they must be written off]{.underline}. The lead
author, Jean-Francois Mercure of the University of Exeter, said the
[shift to clean energy would benefit the world economy
overall]{.underline}, but it would need to be handled carefully to
prevent regional pockets of misery and possible global instability. ["In
a worst-case scenario, people will keep investing in fossil fuels until
suddenly the demand they expected does not materialise and they realise
that what they own is worthless. Then we could see a financial crisis on
the scale of 2008," he said, warning oil capitals]{.underline} such as
Houston could suffer the same fate as Detroit after the decline of the
US car industry unless the transition is carefully managed. The
[challenge is evident at the ongoing Cop26 climate conference, where
some of the nations most at risk of being left with stranded
assets]{.underline} -- such as the oil and gas exporters Russia and
Brazil -- are likely to try to slow down the transition as they have
done at previous climate meetings, while those most likely to gain --
such as the fuel-importing EU -- are pushing for faster action. The new
paper, published in Nature Energy, illustrates how a [drop in demand for
oil and gas before 2036 will reshape the geopolitical landscape. Current
investment flows and government commitments to reach net zero emissions
by 2050 will make **renewable energy more efficient, cheaper and stable,
while fossil fuels will be hi**t by more price volatility. Many carbon
assets, such as oil or coal reserves, will be left unburned, while
machinery will also be stranded and no longer produce value for its
owners]{.underline}. The most vulnerable assets are those in remote
regions or technically challenging environments. Most exposed are
Canadian tar sands, US shale and the Russian Arctic followed by deep
offshore wells in Brazil and elsewhere. North Sea oil is also relatively
expensive to extract and likely to be hit when demand falls. By
contrast, current oil, gas and coal importers such as the EU, Japan,
India and South Korea, will reap hefty economic dividends from the
transition because they will be able to use the money they save on
overseas fuel purchases to invest in their own countries, including
money for renewables that will modernise infrastructure, create jobs and
improve energy independence. The situation for the world's two biggest
emitters -- the US and China -- is more complex as they have more
diversified economies with both substantial fossil fuel assets and
powerful renewable sectors. The UK is in a similar situation, but as a
net energy importer, stands to benefit overall. [Much depends on the
speed and spread of decarbonisation, along with the tactics used by
fossil fuel exporters to sell off their assets before they lose
value]{.underline}. To assess the impacts, the study explored several
different scenarios. In a business-as-usual scenario, researchers
estimate global fossil fuel assets would be valued at over \$25tn by
2036. Most would be held by the US, Russia and Opec nations. But their
analysis shows the true value of these assets is far lower because
renewables are on course to replace them due to technological
innovation, investments flows and government policies. [The value of
fossil fuel assets is projected to fall as a result of net zero
policies, which will diminish demand for oil and gas]{.underline}. With
asset values falling, Opec countries could choose to raise production
and sell off fossil fuels as quickly as possible. This would mean more
fossil fuel assets are stranded elsewhere. In the US, for example, 62%
of assets would be stranded by 2036. In another scenario, Opec accepts
quotas to avoid a destabilising global fire sale. This would mean
slightly lower (\$11tn) stranded assets and the losses would be
distributed more evenly across producer countries. This means the true
value of fossil fuel assets would be around half that estimated today.
This would lead to more than \$1tn hits for each of the US, Russia and
China by 2036. Majority of countries still grow their economies Despite
the loss of fossil fuel assets in this net zero scenario, the world
economy would still grow by \$44tn in real terms by 2036 -- or 3.9%.
Russia and China would see the value of their fossil fuel assets fall,
but their economies would still increase overall. The outlook for
developing nations is even rosier. Countries including Argentina,
Kazakhstan and India are projected to record double-digit economic
growth, assuming they have access to capital from financial
institutions. But the US, Canada and Norway would be among the net
losers because so much of their oil and gas assets are comparatively
expensive to extract. [The model forecasts large economic benefits for
most importers of fossil fuels. The GDP of most European countries would
increase under either net zero scenario, researchers found, with gains
outstripping the lost fossil fuel revenue]{.underline}. The benefits
vary across nations. The UK, for example, would potentially add \$700bn
to the value of its GDP under a net zero scenario, despite losing almost
half of its fossil fuel assets, worth \$120bn, by 2036. By contrast, the
GDP of Norway, which is more dependant on oil exports, could fall by 9%
unless it diversifies rapidly. [The US could also face an overall hit of
\$3.5tn and Canada \$920bn over the next 15 years if they do not reduce
their economic dependence on fossil fuels. The projected losses in these
two North American nations are independent of domestic climate policies
because they stem mostly from a decline in demand for petroleum products
once major markets such as the EU and China have shifted towards net
zero]{.underline}. The extent of asset stranding will partly depend on
low-cost producers, such as Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Opec group
of oil-producing states. If they ramp up production and begin a
fire-sale-style selloff, other exporters could be priced out, leading to
a sudden collapse. Under this scenario \$11tn of global fossil fuel
assets would be stranded. However, if oil producers agreed on a quota
system, the effects could be more evenly distributed and lower overall,
though would still eventually reach \$11tn of stranded assets, according
to the projections. For a nation such as Canada, this could mean a 5%
fall in GDP relative to business as usual, compared with 7% under the
fire-sale scenario -- a difference of about \$400bn. Opec nations are
likely to demand hefty compensation for lost revenue if they agree to
quotas. Saudi Arabia, for example, would make only \$1.3tn under a quota
scenario, compared with \$1.7tn from a fire sale. The authors of the
study say a race to the bottom should be avoided at all costs. "If Saudi
Arabia plays one way and the US another way, then we will see economic,
financial and political instability worldwide, banks going bust and
changes in capital flows. People need to think about these transition
risks very seriously," said Mercure, adding that major institutions,
including the Bank of England and the Bank of France, were increasingly
concerned about the potential dangers to the financial system. [To
prevent chaos, he said, oil exporters should diversify their economies
as quickly as possible before change is forced on them when importers
switch to renewables]{.underline}. Even more important, he said, was
closer engagement between the two sides so the overall economic benefits
of transition could be shared. "This needs to be a story of
international cooperation and not leaving people behind."

record in this respect is not exactly blameless: Fortescue's carbon
footprint is two million tonnes of CO2 per year, about as much as a
small island state. Australia itself has long been a climate laggard and
a major coal exporter, but as China and other big customers plan to cut
their emissions, taking their business with them, that may be changing.
Dozens of the world's biggest economies have adopted targets for
net-zero emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050. And [189 countries have
joined the 2015 Paris climate accord]{.underline}, which aims to limit
global warming to well below 2C. In a race to curb climate change,
countries are rushing to cut fossil fuels, boost clean energy --- and
transform their economies in the process. But [as the energy system
changes, so will energy politics]{.underline}. For most of the past
century, geopolitical power was intimately connected to fossil fuels.
T[he fear of an oil embargo or a gas shortage was enough to forge
alliances or start wars]{.underline}, and access to oil deposits
conferred great wealth. In the world of clean energy, a new set of
winners and losers will emerge. Some see it as a clean energy "space
race". [Countries]{.underline} or regions [that master clean technology,
export **green energy** or import less fossil fuel stand to **gain from
the new system**]{.underline}, while those that rely on exporting fossil
fuels --- such as the Middle East or Russia --- could see their power
decline. Olafur Ragnar Grimsson, the former president of Iceland and
chair of the Global Commission on the Geopolitics of Energy
Transformation, says that the clean energy transition will birth a new
type of politics. The shift is happening "faster, and in a more
comprehensive way, than anyone expected", he says. "As fossil fuels
gradually go out of the energy system . . . t[he old geopolitical model
of power centres]{.underline} that dominate relations between states
also [goes **out the window**]{.underline}. Gradually the power of those
states that were big players in the world of the ­fossil-fuel economies,
or big corporates like the oil companies, will fritter away." In
Australia, a growing lobby is pushing for the country to become a
"renewable superpower" thanks to its abundant wind and solar resources.
Forrest is an investor in a project called the Sun Cable, which hopes to
lay an electric cable all the way to Singapore. He believes the
country's future is at stake. "The impact on the Australian economy, if
we get this right, could be nothing short of nation-building," he says.
New power structures will emerge along with the transition. "The
[\[old\] levers of control]{.underline}, a lot of them
[will]{.underline} dissipate and [simply **cease** to
exist]{.underline}," says Thijs Van de Graaf, associate professor at
Ghent University and lead author of an influential 2019 report from the
International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena). "This is a completely new
constellation, so we cannot think just like the old days," he adds.
"[There is a new class of energy exporters that may emerge on the global
scene]{.underline}."

FROM CARBON TO ELECTRONS

When it comes to exporting clean electricity, countries such as [Norway,
Bhutan and France are already]{.underline} far [ahead]{.underline}. In a
few months' time, [Norway and the UK will finish constructing the
world's longest subsea electricity cable, the North Sea
Link]{.underline}. The Norwegian side of the cable runs through
snow-capped mountains and a deep lake, then travels underwater for more
than 720km, across the North Sea, until it reaches the UK. The highly
specialised cable is also manufactured in Norway, in a factory located
next to a fjord, so that it can be easily loaded on to ships and taken
out to sea for installation. The North Sea Link will be Norway's seventh
subsea interconnector, allowing the country to export its abundant
hydropower to its neighbours. At its most basic, the new energy
transition is a shift from oil and gas to electricity, says Auke Lont,
chief executive of Statnett, Norway's state grid company.
"[Electrification will be the answer to climate change]{.underline}, to
put it at a very general level," he explains. "The reason is that we now
have access to very cheap electricity, and we see that cheap electricity
can serve our energy needs in the future." Whether in trucks or cars or
home heating, the use of [electricity]{.underline} is already surging.
It [provides about 20 per cent of energy today, and will have to rise to
50 per cent by 2050]{.underline}, if countries are to meet their climate
commitments, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency.
"Our world order has been based on oil," says Lont. That is changing:
"[As we go from carbon \[fossil fuels\] to electrons, we will have
a]{.underline} **[world order]{.underline}** [where the **electron**
is]{.underline} **[more important]{.underline}** [than the
carbon.]{.underline}" The question of which countries will end up ahead
is still subject to debate. But there is broad consensus that change is
happening. Pascal Lamy, former head of the World Trade Organization,
compares the global shift from one energy system to another with the
advent of the industrial revolution. "There is an inflection taking
place," he says, from behind the frames of his red glasses in a video
interview. "If you compare the world today to the world 18 months ago,
the big difference is that . . . only 25 per cent of the world had a
decarbonisation horizon. [Today, 75 per cent of the world economy has a
decarbonisation horizon.]{.underline} This is a major shift." The
coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the trend. Last year, new renewable
power hit a record 200 gigawatts, while the rest of the energy sector
shrank. Amid the recession triggered by the pandemic, demand for oil
fell 8.8 per cent and demand for coal 5 per cent, compared to the year
before, according to the International Energy Agency, the Paris-based
oil watchdog. Clean energy was the only part of the energy sector that
had growth in 2020. [The **pace** and **scale** of]{.underline} the
transition to [renewables]{.underline} have already [shot past the most
optimistic projections]{.underline}. The IEA expects that renewables
will soon pass coal as the biggest source of power generation. "We can
say that renewables were immune to Covid. Both solar and wind saw
significant increases \[last year[\]]{.underline}," Fatih Birol, head of
the IEA, said at a press conference in January. "Our numbers show that
[**renewables** are set to become the largest source of generation by
**2025**]{.underline}, overtaking coal --- and [**ending** the
fossil-fuel domination]{.underline} of the last decades." That's a grim
thought for regions such as the Middle East that rely on oil and gas
exports for revenue. Countries that have the most to lose are already
pushing back. At the annual UN climate talks, Saudi Arabia and Russia
routinely play a disruptive role. (Saudi Arabia wants to have it both
ways: a big plan to expand its solar power while continuing to produce
oil and gas.) Meanwhile, Poland, a coal producer, dragged its feet for
months before reluctantly agreeing to the EU's net-zero emissions
target. In a world disrupted by coronavirus, fossil-fuel-producing
countries fear further job losses. The transition will also be painful
for energy companies that produce oil and gas. But even they acknowledge
that it is picking up pace. In a statement that would have once been
unthinkable, BP recently said peak oil may have already occurred in
2019. Ben van Beurden, Shell's chief executive, says electricity will
become a mainstay of its business. "The fundamentals of how we win in
power are going to be really different from how you win in resources
extraction," he says. "In oil and gas, you need an asset base. It is
about having the best rocks, the lowest cost of production." That
equation is turned on its head in the power sector, when the electricity
from one solar farm is just as good as the next. There are other
differences too: unlike gas pipelines, electricity trading can go in
both directions. Renewable power is also more dispersed, rather than
concentrated in a few locations like fossil fuels. "When we talk about
[wind, solar, biomass, hydropower, ocean energy, geothermal]{.underline}
--- they [are]{.underline} actually [available]{.underline} in one form
or another [in most countries]{.underline}," says Van de Graaf. For
places such as Morocco, which imports more than 80 per cent of its
energy but also has abundant solar resources, the transition could be an
economic gift. The Irena report found [three ways for countries to exert
influence]{.underline} in the new system. One is by [exporting
electricity or green fuels.]{.underline} Another is by
[controlling]{.underline} the [raw materials]{.underline} used in clean
energy, [such as lithium and cobalt]{.underline}. The third is by
[gaining an edge in technology, such as e]{.underline}lectric
[v]{.underline}ehicle [batteries.]{.underline} With renewable resources
so readily available, Van de Graaf believes that it is technology which
will end up being the biggest differentiating factor. A tally of
countries' activities in clean energy found one racing far ahead of the
rest. "We have one country in pole position," he says. "China."

CHINA PULLS AHEAD

The southern tip of the Democratic Republic of Congo is famous for the
Tenke Fungurume copper and cobalt mine. The ore is so rich that in some
places it can be dug up by hand --- enterprising locals look out for the
pale-purple "copper flower" that signals the presence of the mineral
below. Huge trucks travel at high speed along the narrow paved road that
leads to the mine, carrying ore, equipment or acid used to process the
minerals. And along the sides of the road, a foreign script is visible
on storefronts and signs --- Chinese. The area has long been the subject
of power disputes, but China's arrival is recent. China Molybdenum,
which is listed in Hong Kong and Shanghai, bought the mine from
Freeport-McMoran, the US copper giant, for \$2.65bn in 2016. Initially,
it looked as if China's bet was struggling: copper and cobalt prices
fell, and disputes with local suppliers caused the mine to lag behind in
production. But today, [as demand for copper and cobalt
soars]{.underline} due to the clean energy transition, it seems like a
masterstroke. Copper is essential for electric cables and wind turbines,
and cobalt is used in electric vehicle batteries. [China **Molybdenum**
now controls more than **one-tenth** of the world's cobalt]{.underline}.
Tenke Fungurume is an "absolutely great asset", says copper analyst
George Heppel of business intelligence company CRU. "I don't think
there's anything quite like that size, in terms of gigantic deposits."
The purchase is just one in a series of moves that have put Chinese
groups ahead in almost every area of clean tech. [China]{.underline}
[produces]{.underline} [more than 70 per cent of all solar]{.underline}
photovoltaic [panels]{.underline}, half of the world's electric vehicles
and [a third of]{.underline} its [wind power]{.underline}. It
[is]{.underline} also [the **biggest battery producer**]{.underline} and
controls many of the raw materials crucial for clean-tech supply chains,
such as cobalt, rare earth minerals and polysilicon, a key ingredient in
solar panels. "If you talk about the clean energy technology race, in
many ways, it looks as if the race has already been run, and the winner
is China," says Van de Graaf. "Other players are trying to catch up."
[The US]{.underline}, for example, [has limited domestic supplies of
cobalt and lithium]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} the state department
has for the past few years tried to improve access to [rare earth
minerals]{.underline}, due to their strategic importance. For China,
this advantage has been part strategy, part luck. Policymakers have long
worried about the country's dependence on imported oil and gas, and
Beijing embraced renewable energy manufacturing relatively early,
focusing particularly on solar panels and LEDs. All this was
supercharged in September 2020, when President Xi Jinping announced at
the UN General Assembly that China would reach carbon neutrality by
2060. "Covid-19 reminds us that humankind should launch a green
revolution," said Xi, in an announcement that came as a surprise to
many. "Humankind can no longer afford to ignore the repeated warnings of
nature," he added. Xi also spoke about the "historic opportunities''
created by this new phase of "industrial transformation". Last year,
China installed a record 120GW of new wind turbines and solar panels
domestically, more than double the year before. Meanwhile, China's Belt
and Road Initiative, the international development programme that has
been criticised for being coal-friendly, invested more in renewable
projects than fossil fuels for the first time. Making the transition
won't be easy --- [China is still the world's biggest emitter of
greenhouse gases]{.underline} and is heavily dependent on coal, which
supplies 58 per cent of its electricity. [But its companies]{.underline}
are poised to [benefit]{.underline} greatly, not only from the domestic
energy transition, but [from **growing demand** for
**clean-tech**]{.underline} products around the world. As major
economies work to reach their net-zero goals, they will have to buy more
solar panels, batteries and critical minerals. The main supplier? China.

THE RACE FOR BATTERIES

China's sway over battery manufacturing reflects its long-term strategy.
Its poster child is CATL, Contemporary Amperex Technology. Founded in
2011 in the mountainous eastern fishing town of Ningde, the company owes
a large part of its success to government protectionism. In 2015, as
China was pouring billions into its electric vehicle market, the
government suddenly announced a list of approved battery-makers who were
eligible for subsidies, none of which were foreign. This was a boon to
domestic businesses: CATL grew from producing 6.2GWh worth of batteries
in 2016 to 34GWh last year --- a third of the global market. Now the
biggest producer in the world, it has contracts with Daimler, BMW and
Tesla among others. Beijing dominates the supply chain from the mines in
the DRC to the final production of lithium-ion batteries. Its companies
control more than 85 per cent of the world's refined cobalt chemical
capacity, essential for most lithium-ion batteries. It also mines almost
all of the world's rare earth minerals, which are used in electric
motors and wind turbines. Making an electric vehicle without involving
China is almost impossible. China's manufacturing prowess has helped to
drive down the global cost of batteries, making electric cars more
competitive. This echoes what has happened with other clean energy
technologies, from solar panels to polysilicon production: subsidies led
to overcapacity and a rush to produce, and ended up with China
dominating global markets. The cost of lithium-ion batteries today is
just one-seventh what it was a decade ago, according to Bloomberg New
Energy Finance. CATL is now building a battery plant in Germany. "It was
actually a brilliant strategy," says Jim Greenberger, founder of
NAATBatt, the North American trade association for advanced battery
technology. "CATL was the winner and they have used that scale to
compete very effectively in the export market. That's the issue we're
dealing with in the west: how to compete with Chinese companies that
have gotten to scale, via use of industrial policy." As the world shifts
from carbon to electron, [China]{.underline} has been active in
[developing]{.underline} [the electricity network that will be the
backbone of the clean energy system]{.underline}. One of Xi's pet
projects is the Global Energy Interconnection --- a network of
high-voltage transmission lines that would span the globe. The project
envisages cheap electricity being shipped around the world --- from dams
in Congo to Europe. It is headed by Liu Zhenya, the former chief of
State Grid, who describes it as the "internet of energy". While the
Global Energy Interconnection will take decades to build, [it signals
how Chinese policymakers are thinking]{.underline} about the new global
order. "The idea is [to connect countries]{.underline} with \[clean
energy\] resources, [with]{.underline} those that have the
[demand]{.underline}," explains Xu Yi-chong, author of Sinews of Power:
The Politics of the State Grid Corporation. China's clean energy
dominance has faced a backlash, which could grow as the energy
transition gathers speed. The US and EU have repeatedly slapped tariffs
on Chinese photovoltaic panels in trade disputes, while new rules in
Europe could reduce imports of Chinese batteries. Recent revelations
about forced labour in Xinjiang --- a region that produces most of the
world's polysilicon --- threaten further sanctions. Abigail Ross Hopper,
president of the US Solar Energy Industries Association, said in January
that the association has been telling "all solar companies operating in
the Xinjiang region to immediately move their supply chains". Steven
Chu, former US energy secretary, says that [it is "absolutely" a
**concern for the US to rely on Chinese supply chains for its energy
transition**]{.underline}. "For strategic reasons, [you don't want to be
beholden to a single country supplier,]{.underline}" he says, drawing an
analogy to China's dominance in making masks and other personal
protective equipment during the coronavirus pandemic.

However he believes that the US --- which could see as much as \$2tn
invested in climate initiatives proposed by President Joe Biden ---
still has an edge in innovation. "I personally think \[the most
innovation\] is still in the United States, in terms of laboratory
innovation in new batteries," he says. "But then it really is a matter
of how you get that invention and discovery . . . to become large-scale
manufacturing. And that's where China excels." This is likely to be a
challenge for Biden, who has made climate change a top priority. He
wants the US to adopt a net-zero emissions target, but he has also
pledged to revive US manufacturing. Jonas Nahm, assistant professor of
energy at Johns Hopkins University, says new US climate targets could
benefit Chinese companies: "This administration is caught in a pickle,
which is that all of the climate goals that are being promised will rely
on China, at least in the short term." Other global leaders face a
similar quandary: as they invest more in the energy transition, some of
that money will filter back to China. "This is prompting a lot of
anxiety, especially amid this proliferation of net-zero commitments,"
says Van de Graaf, "because other countries, such as Japan, the US and
the EU, will make a transition that is very costly, and the economic
benefit of that will be reaped disproportionately by China." WINDS OF
CHANGES Many of those countries are taking their own steps toward a
clean energy future. In the town of Blyth, on the north-east coast of
England, the harbour is full of wind farm activity. The former mining
town is reinventing itself as a centre for the wind industry. A
deep-water port makes it an ideal launch point for wind farm
construction boats, and a blade testing facility that opened in 2017 has
been certifying some of the longest in the world. The UK is the largest
producer of offshore wind power globally and Prime Minister Boris
Johnson has pledged to make it "the Saudi Arabia of wind", with a plan
to quadruple offshore wind capacity by 2030. Europe has long been ahead
in this industry, and European companies still hold a lead in turbine
manufacturing. In the North Sea, many of the companies that used to work
in the declining oil and gas sector are shifting their focus. Blyth also
happens to be the arrival point for the high-voltage subsea cable
between the UK and Norway. Nigel Williams, project director of the North
Sea Link for National Grid, sees it as the "perfect landing spot". "What
we are doing, really, is to find a way to maximise the renewables we
generate in the UK," he says. When the UK has surplus power on windy
days or during storms, it will export electricity to Norway. When the
weather is calmer, it will import power from Norwegian dams. The
interconnector can provide about the same amount of energy as Blyth's
two coal-fired power plants, which are both now closed. But Blyth is
also set to be the home of Britishvolt, a start-up seeking to build the
UK's first battery gigafactory. (Construction has yet to begin on the
site, a £2.6bn project that is still to receive full funding.) Chief
strategy officer Isobel Sheldon says Britishvolt aims to have a
competitive edge by tailoring its batteries to each car manufacturer and
making them in a more environmentally friendly way. The company, whose
website is covered in pictures of the Union Jack, plans to start
production in 2023. Sheldon still nurses a grudge that current
lithium-ion battery technology --- invented at Oxford in 1980 --- has
been slow to catch on in the UK. "It's always irritated me to death that
we created the technology and the rest of the world has capitalised on
it," she says. "The west has been caught sleeping on this." The EU's
plans for green recovery will give a boost to several clean energy
technologies, such as the hydrogen industry, which will receive about
€30bn. As Brussels edges closer to adopting a carbon border adjustment
tax --- which would slap a tariff on goods like steel from countries
with no carbon pricing --- that could give a shot in the arm to the
manufacturing of green steel and aluminium. As the EU prepares for its
target of net-zero emissions by 2050, some countries are planning to
trade more green fuels. Portugal recently agreed to ship green hydrogen
to the Netherlands, while Germany is weighing a deal to buy hydrogen
from Morocco. "This is giving rise to a whole new constellation of
bilateral trade relationships," says Van de Graaf. "There is a new class
of energy exporters that may emerge on the global scene." Countries with
lots of sunshine, such as Spain and Portugal, are eager to find ways to
convert that into a commercial fuel. Trading power is also on the rise:
there are already more than 80 cross-border interconnectors in Europe,
with 20 planned or under construction.

WAR OR PEACE

There are two schools of thought about the energy transition. One
believes it is a kind of [clean energy realpolitik]{.underline}, [marked
by]{.underline} the desire to gain [economic advantage]{.underline}.
[The actions of China, the US and Europe reflect this]{.underline} kind
of [thinking.]{.underline} [But the other is that clean energy will
involve]{.underline} a lot **[less geopolitics]{.underline}** and might
help reduce conflict --- [a more utopian future]{.underline}. Paul
Stevens, a fellow at think-tank Chatham House, subscribes to the latter
view. "It's like the geopolitics of carrots," he says. "There are no
geopolitics of carrots, and renewables are the same as carrots. You can
be self-sufficient with them, and you don't need to rely on somebody to
keep the Strait of Hormuz open." [The **spread of renewable energy**
will **reduce**]{.underline} potential [**conflicts** by ending the
dependence on oil-producing countries]{.underline}, he adds. Levers of
control in the clean energy system will still exist, but will never be
as powerful as in the fossil-fuel world, says former Iceland leader
Grimsson. Even though China is ahead in many respects, that should not
be seen as a threat: "China can help countries on the road to renewable
energy. But once they are there, they can no longer exert power, as the
oil-rich countries have done over the years." Danish climate and energy
minister Dan Jorgensen agrees. "Hopefully this will lead to a more
peaceful world, where [international geopolitics in energy is less of a
zero-sum game]{.underline}," he says. "We depend on each other's
renewable energy sources, in a completely different way than if you just
take it out of the ground." That view is reflected in Denmark's policy:
the country is a significant trader of electricity with neighbours, and
its grid will be fully powered by renewables by 2027. During the next
few years, as the energy transition gathers pace, [the biggest
resistance is likely to come from countries that produce fossil
fuels.]{.underline} Even in the rosiest scenario, it will be decades
before oil and gas are removed from the energy system. Many producers
will keep pulling hydrocarbons out of the ground as long as possible.
Australia is one example of how challenging the journey will be: the
government has maintained its support for the coal industry and refused
to adopt climate targets in line with the Paris agreement. Forrest, the
mining magnate, believes companies will push back against the energy
transition. "Let's not underestimate the challenge. The fossil-fuel
sector will react to falling green hydrogen prices by slashing the cost
of oil and gas until it's almost zero," he said in a TV lecture. "At the
end, it will be grim --- think of a knife fight in a telephone box."
[Whatever the resistance, the green transition has now gathered so much
momentum]{.underline} --- with net-zero goals enshrined in law in many
countries --- [that what once looked impossible now seems
inevitable]{.underline}. Just as the advent of coal and oil remade the
world, clean energy is set to do the same. [The energy transition will
not only **cut emissions**: it will **redistribute power**]{.underline}.

### Ext. Low Prices Key

#### Low oil prices key to renewable energy -- it crushes oil company profits which makes renewables compete

**Woodring 16** (Douglas, [Founder, Ocean Recovery Alliance & Plastic
Disclosure Project](http://whartonmagazine.com/author/), 1/20/16, "Cheap
Oil Could Fuel Renewable Energy",
[http://whartonmagazine.com/blogs/cheap-oil-could-fuel-renewable-energy/#sthash.EcpVvBbI.dpbs/](http://whartonmagazine.com/blogs/cheap-oil-could-fuel-renewable-energy/#sthash.EcpVvBbI.dpbs/ )
)

[The]{.underline} [[Paris]{.underline} COP21 Climate
[Agreement]{.underline}](http://www.cop21paris.org/) in December [put
the world in an exciting position]{.underline}, with [187
countries]{.underline} [agreeing to]{.underline} make intended
nationally determined contributions (INDCs) to [control the impacts of
CO2]{.underline} on our environment. That we reached such a consensus
was amazing in itself, but now we need to act on this collective
momentum. [Many wonder who will lead this charge and where the "big
wins" will come from. Those who follow these issues can now celebrate,
as 2016 brought a large unexpected global gift---oil at \$30 per
barrel]{.underline}, or even less (it went below \$27 today). No one
ever expected these low prices. With assumptions of "peak oil"
constraining supply and China and India's growth driving demand, most
assumed high revenues and continual investment while government
subsidies kept the machine well-oiled. [The old school of thought was
that high oil prices made renewable energy more competitive, but this
did not remove the need for clean energy to also compete against over
\$650 billion]{.underline} in global [subsidies to]{.underline} the
[oil]{.underline} industry. Now, contrary to popular belief[, with oil
at \$30 per barrel and the reverse oil shock, we have the opportunity of
a lifetime to shift needed investment into clean energy]{.underline}.
Why is this the case? [Because Big Oil companies are hemorrhaging at the
wells and laying off large chunks of their staff, and countries are now
much less inclined to keep those unnatural levels of pollution subsidies
intact as they reallocate spending on infrastructure and services that
have long been needed. With low oil prices, the social
pressure]{.underline} to keep prices artificially low [is also greatly
reduced.]{.underline} Listening to the Starting Gun Those listening will
have heard the "starting gun" go off, marking the start of the big shift
to renewables that we have been waiting for. [Large oil players no
longer have the resources or the guts to make new big investments in
wells]{.underline}, which are increasingly more expensive. [The [oil
industry]{.underline} is [down]{.underline} over [\$3
trillion]{.underline} since prices have
fallen](http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-recession-caused-by-low-oil-prices-1452211556),
with earnings of the [S&P 500 energy sector down by 76
percent]{.underline}. Of the U.S. syndicated loans for the oil and gas
industry (\$256 billion), 15 percent are now regarded as distressed. The
other significant factor driving this shift is that changes now happen
in Internet time, and the [disruptive innovation of fracking will
virtually guarantee that oil prices will not ris]{.underline}e for a
long time coming (unless there are significant international political
disruptions, which is all the more likely with oil countries losing
their main revenue sources). Fracking is the ability to extract gas from
shale in previously unreachable locations and quantities with relative
ease. This means that the [large incumbents and oil nations who have
relied on high prices have had the rug pulled out from under their feet
with a multitude of smaller players now competing with production and
supply.]{.underline} Seeing the Environmental Silver Lining
Environmental groups do not like the potential dangers and impacts of
fracking, but there is a big unintended silver lining for renewable
energies. [Now with low oil prices, even the new small fracking players
will not want to enter the market. So, where will the money go? To clean
energy]{.underline}. There is no turning back technology, and [fracking
has now opened the flood gate]{.underline}, creating enough supply that
the U.S. can become an oil/gas exporter. That flood gate [also comes in
parallel with scaled advances in solar, wind and other clean
technologies, bringing prices down even further, while uptake and
installations escalate]{.underline}. This is [coupled with: Rapid growth
of e]{.underline}lectric [v]{.underline}ehicles [and battery
capacity]{.underline} with the likes of Tesla and Panasonic Boom of
megacities where autos will no longer thrive [Regional trade
agreements]{.underline}, [like]{.underline} the one within the [[Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation

which reduces the tariffs on clean-tech equipment to 5 percent or
less]{.underline} between all member states, while they [collectively
aim to double renewable energy generation by 2020]{.underline} and
reduce energy intensity 45 percent by 2035. Tapping the Smart Money
[Smart money will now begin to shift to the places it belongs---in
smart, long-term investments for clean energy]{.underline}. Countries
will now be even more supportive than before for clean energy options,
as a consequence of the Paris COP21 Agreement and the INDCs, while the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are being more widely addressed,
having been revised by the United Nations in September. These new
investments are "smart" because they also come with reduced liabilities,
which face old energy in the form carbon taxes or offset fees, pension
fund divestment pressure and poor brand reputation from the
carbon-centric world of the past. Long-term [investors]{.underline} and
[lenders now really have to take an educated guess at]{.underline}
30-year infrastructure [bets on oil]{.underline}, and even coal, both
[with significant new uncertainties. Short-term money]{.underline}, on
the other hand, [will steer clear]{.underline} for the immediate future,
giving room for even more momentum for renewables to take hold.
[Investments in environmental goods and services]{.underline},
meanwhile, are [expected to grow]{.underline} from [\$500 billion today
[to \$2 trillion within five
years]{.underline}](http://asia.nikkei.com/magazine/20160107-Off-to-the-POLLS/Viewpoints/Alan-Bollard-Far-from-being-a-threat-to-the-planet-trade-can-benefit-it).
Conclusion: [Renewables Can and Will Take off The perfect storm is
here,]{.underline} but it has come in the back door and has caught
everyone by surprise. In fact, most have not seen it yet. [The mindset
continues to be that low oil prices will kill off new innovations. Not
this time.]{.underline} It only takes a year or two in this day and age
for innovations and scale to take root, and [with all of the right

#### High oil prices hurts transition to renewables---it undercuts gas taxes which are key to funding the transition

**Singh 19** (Prasanna, 4/23/19, "Rising Oil Prices. The Good And Bad
for Renewables",
[https://www.saurenergy.com/solar-energy-news/rising-oil-prices-the-good-and-bad-for-renewables/](https://www.saurenergy.com/solar-energy-news/rising-oil-prices-the-good-and-bad-for-renewables/%20)
)

[Typically, sector enthusiasts for renewables don't mind higher oil
prices]{.underline}, as it helps make the case for renewables stronger.
In fact, some of the biggest investments in EV's were made when oil
prices were threatening to spike to \$75 plus levels. [The situation is
a lot more complicated today. As things stand, the renewables economy is
far more likely to be impacted by higher coal prices than
oil]{.underline}, as the focus stays firmly on the broader energy
sector, where coal remains king. Especially in the largest energy
consumers like China, the US and India. Coal prices incidentally have
been remarkably stubborn, staying at constant prices for most of the
past five years, except for a brief dive in 2015. That means the cost of
energy from coal has gone up mostly due to higher costs associated with
producing less pollution and scrubbing the pollutants generated from
coal, rather than across the board. With the renewables economy
increasingly being compared to coal-fired costs, the lack of big enough
breakthroughs on areas like storage etc is weighing down potential
growth. Keep in mind that [in many major consumers, the trend on oil has
shifted to higher taxation, to cut down use and find the funds to
decarbonise. Something India's ruling government did when oil prices
were dropping during 2014-16]{.underline}. But with the taxes seemingly
at a peak, a sudden spike in oil prices could actually mean lesser
support for renewable initiatives, something we are seeing with the
sharp cutback in subsidies and the move to auction led models for
renewables in key markets like China, India and elsewhere. The auction
model, while very effective in terms of lowest price discovery, has
perhaps come in a little before its time thus, as it puts immense
financial pressure on a sector that is capital intensive. With few firms
having the balance sheet size and capital to raise money on easy terms,
[rising oil prices could actually lead to the unintended consequence of
concentration in the renewables sector.]{.underline} Keep in mind too
[that higher oil prices at this stage will probably help the largest oil
producers]{.underline}, most of whom have only grudgingly agreed to the
effects of their products on the environment, and are moving too slowly
to make a serious dent to the market, as they can. [Increasing taxes
will no longer be possible, as we have already seen in France where
protests have roiled the country. Even in India, petrol prices face a
massive psychological resistance at Rs 100, which few politicians will
dare cross]{.underline} for some time to come if they can help it. The
EV market too, while seemingly benefiting from higher oil prices,
eventually faces risks, as [long as the energy powering EV's comes
primarily from fossil fuels. Not only does that dent the case for EV's,
but it also extends the time for an EV to be truly green.]{.underline}
Considering everything, [we estimate that oil at a price above
\$65/barrel will serve the interests of very few across the world, and
for countries like India especially, it is a serious risk to moves to
accelerate efforts to decarbonising its energy grid.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Economy Turn

#### **High oil prices cause economic decline**

[In the past, recessions were often linked to oil price
surges]{.underline}. Oil shocks were associated with the 1973-74 OPEC
embargo, the 1978-79 Iranian Revolution, the 1980 Iran-Iraq war and
Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. [Economist James Hamilton
has argued that a spike in oil prices from 2007 to 2008 even contributed
to the Great Recession.]{.underline}

Will the current spike in oil prices (U.S. crude oil price rose from
around \$66 in early December 2021 to around \$120 in early March 2022)
trigger an economic downturn? To answer the question, it is necessary to
consider the multiple channels through which a spike in oil prices will
adversely impact the growth of the real economy.

James Hamilton's seminal research led to a decades-long attempt to
discern the macroeconomic effects associated with oil price
fluctuations. Asymmetries and shifting responses complicate the task of
establishing a clear relationship between oil price volatility and real
GDP. The extent to which output is impacted by oil shocks depends, among
other factors, on the nature and source of the disturbance, the price
dynamics leading up to the shock and the underlying economic conditions
that were prevalent prior to the shock.

[Past studies have shown that the U.S. economy reacts asymmetrically to
oil price fluctuations. Specifically, the adverse or negative economic
impact arising from rising oil prices often exceeded the stimulative
effect resulting from falling oil prices. Economists have identified
both direct and indirect economic effects associated with a sudden (and
unexpected) spike in oil prices.]{.underline}

A San Francisco Federal Reserve report summarized [the direct impact of
high oil prices thus: "When gasoline prices increase, a larger share of
households' budgets is likely to be spent on it, which leaves less to
spend on other goods and services.]{.underline} The same goes for
businesses whose goods must be shipped from place to place or that use
fuel as a major input (such as the airline industry). [Higher oil prices
tend to make production more expensive for businesses]{.underline}, just
as they make it more expensive for households to do the things they
normally do."

An adverse oil price shock can also [generate a series of indirect
effects.]{.underline} In the real world, capital and labor cannot be
reallocated among sectors in a rapid fashion due to the presence of
various frictions. [If there are costs and/or time delays associated
with reallocation of capital and labor, then aggregate demand and output
may decline in the short run.]{.underline} For instance, auto
manufacturers cannot shift production from gas-guzzling SUVs and pickup
trucks to fuel-efficient cars or electric vehicles overnight. The global
oil refinery sector offers another illustration of the underlying
challenges.

Furthermore, the heightened uncertainty resulting from the oil price
shock may cause consumers to postpone purchases of durable goods and
firms to delay irreversible investments. [Such behavioral changes in
aggregate could produce an economic slowdown in the short
run.]{.underline}

Another indirect effect associated with a negative oil price shock is
related to the central bank's response. Driven by inflationary concerns,
[central banks may hike interest rates in response to a surge in oil
price and, thus, contribute to a potential slowdown in economic
activity.]{.underline} The significance of the indirect monetary channel
has been a matter of some debate.

As we look ahead, one cannot help but wonder if this threat of long-term
**[economic]{.underline}** stagnation and [**decline** will]{.underline}
not [be the **catalyst** for **major conflicts**]{.underline} in the
future. For one, such [economic troubles could **fuel**]{.underline}
political **[radicalism]{.underline}**, [as it did in the]{.underline}
1920s and **[1930s]{.underline}**. At the same time, [rising levels of
**protectionism** and **nationalism** could lead to far worse trade
disputes]{.underline} than we have seen in recent years, [something that
could]{.underline} also [turn an economic dispute into a military
conflict]{.underline}. Finally, [the battle for **control** of
**strategic resources** such as oil, water, land or
**rare-earth**]{.underline} element**[s]{.underline}** [could
**intensify as**]{.underline} economic [**growth** slows, resulting in
conflicts over]{.underline} the control of these
**[resources]{.underline}**.

[There are many examples of]{.underline} potential [conflicts between
large]{.underline} economic [powers that could **erupt**]{.underline} in
the years and decades ahead, [**particularly** if]{.underline} economic
[**growth** continues to slow]{.underline} over the longer-term. For
example, tensions between the world's two superpowers, [the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
**China**]{.underline}, [have risen]{.underline} steadily in recent
years, due in part to US concerns about China's rising economic and
military power. As [there are a large number of **flashpoints** that
could bring these two]{.underline} giant [powers into
conflict]{.underline} (**[Taiwan]{.underline}**, **[No]{.underline}**rth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea, **[S]{.underline}**outh **[C]{.underline}**hina
**[S]{.underline}**ea, etc.), [the likelihood of a superpower conflict
is]{.underline} now [greater]{.underline} than it has been at any time
since the early 1980s.

[This is not the only potential great power conflict]{.underline} that
the world faces today. For example, [tensions between the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and **Russia**
have]{.underline} [also been rising]{.underline} as the latter seeks to
regain some of the geopolitical importance and influence that it lost in
the wake of the dissolution of the Soviet Union. [The growing rivalry
between **China and India** is another flashpoint that has the potential
to **erupt**]{.underline} into a conflict between two major economic
powers, particularly [in light of]{.underline} the [numerous border
disputes]{.underline} between those two Asian giants. In fact, [there
are a number of]{.underline} potential [conflicts involving]{.underline}
two or more [major economies that could **erupt** in the
near-future]{.underline}, [any of which would]{.underline} not only [be
influenced by **economic factors**]{.underline}, but would also have a
major impact on the economies of the combatants, as well as on the
global economy as a whole.

### 2AC -- Petrol State Aggression Turn

#### High prices cause war and instability: petrol-aggression.

**Ashford 22** \[Emma Ashford; Adjunct Professor of Security Studies at
Georgetown university, Ph.D., Foreign Affairs; 5-22-2011; The Problem
With Being a Petrostate; Foreign Policy;

Accessed 7-18-2025; RS\]

Cicero, perhaps apocryphally, is said to have written that ["endless
money forms the sinews of war." **War** and **wealth** are intrinsically
**linked**]{.underline}. A nation's ability to wage war is inherently
dependent on its ability to raise and fund armed forces.

Oil-wealthy states---defined here as those that earn more than \$1,000
per capita in oil and natural gas revenues each year---hold vast, easily
obtained wealth that makes them almost uniquely capable of waging war
without sacrificing domestic priorities. Due to high levels of income
from oil and gas production, they can afford to build up military
capacity, buy weapons, increase military salaries, or engage in research
and development, all without substantial budgetary trade-offs. To put it
another way: If they wish, [leaders in **oil**-wealthy **states** can
have guns **and** butter.]{.underline}

Oil-wealthy states are a diverse bunch, [including **Russia**, small and
large **Mid**dle **East**ern states]{.underline} (Qatar, Iran), several
wealthy democracies (Norway, Australia), [and various]{.underline}
underdeveloped [**African** and Central **Asian** nations]{.underline}
(Libya, Equatorial Guinea, Turkmenistan). Yet although they face a
diverse set of national security challenges, [most **share** common
**trends** in their military **expenditures**: As oil **prices rise**,
so does military **spending**. When oil **prices crash**, military
spending eventually **drops**. Cross-national **stat**istical
analysi**s** confirm]{.underline}s that [oil-wealthy states **spend
more**]{.underline} on their militaries on an absolute basis,
[regardless of **regime type** or major-**power status**.]{.underline}

Likewise, data on arms sales shows a strong correlation between oil
wealth and weapons purchases. According to a metric from the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute, although wealthy oil states are
a relatively small proportion of all states globally, they have been
well represented among top arms importers, both during the Cold War and
after. Global arms sales have largely risen in line with oil prices in
recent decades.

Of course, there are other ways to transform money into military
capacity, notably in the research and development of advanced
technologies. The most controversial investment in technological
research is the development of a nuclear weapons program. Data on
nuclear programs and nuclear latency reveals that [oil **wealth** is
strongly correlated with]{.underline} nuclear development, with
oil-wealthy states on average more likely to have [an active **nuclear**
program or]{.underline} to have [the **latent** nuclear
**capacity**]{.underline} necessary to build one quickly.

Interestingly, oil wealth is not correlated with higher spending as a
percentage of government expenditure. In plain English, this means that
oil-rich and oil-poor states appear to spend comparable chunks of their
overall budgets on their militaries. If the state budget is a pie, then
oil-wealthy states simply have a much larger pie, with the government
spending more overall.

And while oil-wealthy states may spend more on their militaries, that
doesn't necessarily mean they have more combat capability to show for
it. Arms must be chosen wisely to meet key threats, and troops must be
trained on new weapon systems to use them effectively. Spending a lot on
prestige weapon systems---fighter jets or the latest in high-tech
gadgets---may look impressive but yield little military advantage.

Politically difficult changes in strategy, doctrine, or force structure
may be necessary to improve military effectiveness, even with higher
levels of spending. This is particularly the case in countries with high
levels of corruption and underdeveloped institutions---maladies common
in oil-wealthy states. Indeed, we've seen many of these flaws on public
display in recent months in Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Despite
billions poured into Russia's military modernization over the last
decade, the military has performed abysmally.

Even well-implemented military spending doesn't always yield battlefield
effectiveness. For authoritarian regimes, battlefield effectiveness may
be impeded by other regime priorities such as coup-proofing. Consider
Saddam Hussein's Iraq, where efforts at coup-proofing against his army
resulted in poor performance and near disaster during the early years of
the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s. Any army that prioritizes domestic
policing and repression is not necessarily an effective fighting force
against peer competitors.

As in any state, therefore, military expenditure must be coupled with
effective management and strategic doctrine to produce a capable force.
What military expenditure does offer, mainly, is potential---the
potential to substantially improve military capability if it is spent
wisely.

The more difficult question is whether increased military expenditure
itself makes a state more likely to initiate conflicts. One could argue
that oil wealth doesn't cause war but merely facilitates it.

Yet [**excessive** military **spending** could easily increase the risk
of **conflict**]{.underline}. The connection is simple: [Having a
well-equipped and **well-funded** military gives leaders **more
confidence** in their ability to win]{.underline}. These [leaders can
assume]{.underline}, perhaps wrongly, that [they have **assembled** a
superior fighting force]{.underline}. Baathist Iraq---a particularly
belligerent petrostate---provides an illustration of this: Saddam's
conviction in his own military genius, his faith in new armaments, and
his belief that his troops performed well (despite all evidence) often
led him to conflicts he could not win. Libya's Muammar al-Qaddafi made
similar mistakes.

This offers one potential explanation for [oil-wealthy
states']{.underline} tendency toward conflict: Their [**overconfident**
leaders mistake **high** military **spending** for actual
capability]{.underline}. It also suggests an unfortunate corollary:
[Oil-wealthy states]{.underline} not only [are **more likely** to start
wars]{.underline} but may be more likely to lose them. Oil wealth may
even cushion the negative impact of losing a war, [providing ways to
**buy off**]{.underline} segments of [society and allowing a leader to
**maintain power** despite]{.underline} repeated
**[conflict]{.underline}** losses.

### 2AC -- Russian Aggression

#### High prices cause Russian Adventurism -- empirics prove

Amid the historic tensions between Russia and Ukraine and the grand
geopolitical dynamics currently unfolding between Moscow and the West,
the role that **[crude oil]{.underline}** plays [in **greasing** the
**wheels** of **conflict**]{.underline} can become obscured.

But [a look back at past conflicts reveals a **strong correlation**
between **soaring** oil **prices** and Moscow's willingness to
**assert** its will **aggressively** beyond its borders]{.underline}.

During Russia's two military attacks on its former Soviet neighbours --
the August 2008 war in Georgia, and its February 2014 seizure of Crimea
and then the Donbas region from Ukraine -- oil prices were at
historically elevated levels (\$125 and \$102.57 respectively for global
benchmark Brent crude).

Currently, oil prices are on the ascent again, reaching seven-year highs
on Friday with US benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude topping \$91 a
barrel and Brent crude soaring past \$92 a barrel.

Those [**gains** fill Moscow's **coffers** and might imbue the Kremlin
with a sense of **immunity** from the **threat** of]{.underline} further
Western **[sanctions]{.underline}** or economic isolation.

Bob McNally, former senior director for international energy on United
States President George W Bush's National Economic Council and CEO of
the energy consultancy Rapidan Energy Group, told Al Jazeera that [oil
forecasters have seen this pattern play out before in **Georgia** and
**Ukraine**]{.underline}.

[In each case, **war** was **preceded** by several years of **high oil
prices**]{.underline}.

"In each case, war was preceded by several years of high oil prices,
[that **no doubt** played a role in **emboldening Russian
leaders**]{.underline}," said McNally, who was effectively Bush's top
energy adviser from 2001 to 2003. "Higher oil prices along with other
measures Moscow has taken to protect its financial system from sanctions
will help it withstand garden-variety sanctions."

#### High oil prices enable Russian aggression

President vladimir putin boasts about the strength of the Russian
economy in the face of Western sanctions, citing estimates by
international financial institutions that Russian gdp shrank only
modestly in 2022. The Russian leader's bullishness is hardly surprising,
and he is not alone: it is a widely held view that the sanctions imposed
on his regime have had little economic impact. A recent overview of the
Russian economy by the Re: Russia Project, a network of experts,
challenges this thesis. The report, prepared by a group of economists
including former top figures from Russia's finance ministry and central
bank, a professor at the University of California and myself, finds that
sanctions have indeed had a big effect: they have led to capital
outflows from Russia equivalent to 12% of its gdp. Under normal
circumstances, that would precipitate an economic disaster. However,
there is a powerful force that mitigates the effect of sanctions, namely
high energy prices. [The boost in revenues from higher energy
sales]{.underline} and the reduction of imports (due to sanctions) [have
resulted in a trade surplus of about 18% of gdp]{.underline}. This
surplus and the inflow of petrodollars have helped Russia avoid economic
meltdown. But a hidden crisis is not the same as a strong economy. We
call this situation "worse than crisis" because high revenues from
energy exports act as an anaesthetic that does not allow the economy to
feel the damage done by sanctions and respond adequately. Right now,
supply exceeds demand in the global oil market. But according to the
March forecast by the International Energy Agency, demand will increase
significantly by the end of the year; this will push prices up again.
Even taking into account a substantial discount on the price of Russian
crude, in part the result of a g7-imposed price cap, oil will provide Mr
Putin with enough funds to continue his war and sustain his repressive
regime. Western efforts to limit Russian oil's access to the market are
likely to have little effect. It is time to admit that **[high oil
prices]{.underline}** [are the **main factor**]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} Mr [Putin's **aggression**]{.underline} [**outside**
and **inside Russia.**]{.underline} And it makes sense to [put the
problem in a broader perspective.]{.underline} [In the 1990s the average
price]{.underline} of a barrel of Brent oil [was \$27]{.underline} (in
constant 2010 dollars[). In the 2000s it was \$54, and in the past 12
years it has been more than \$70]{.underline} ([it is
currently]{.underline} around \$[80]{.underline}). Russia has received
an average of \$250bn a year from oil and gas sales over the past 15
years. **[The enormous]{.underline}** [size of this hydrocarbon **rent**
has allowed]{.underline} Mr [Putin to buy the loyalty]{.underline} [of
the population and form clientelist networks within the
elites]{.underline}. All this strengthened his authoritarianism -- and
that of others, too. In the 1990s many formerly authoritarian countries
sought rapprochement with the West and looked to adapt Western market
institutions and democracy, because they were interested in expanding
trade and investment with developed countries. But [the era of high
resource prices has made such strategies much less
attractive.]{.underline} [Inward investment became less necessary
because it was successfully substituted by the **inflow of
rents**]{.underline}. And the expansion of domestic consumer markets in
prospering authoritarian countries has enticed foreign firms to invest
in and trade with them, turning a blind eye to corruption and
human-rights abuses. I am convinced that [**if energy prices** had been
much lower]{.underline}, [the war in Ukraine would not have]{.underline}
[happened]{.underline}. [Huge **revenues** from trade not only
consolidated authoritarianism and the elites that profited from their
distribution]{.underline}, but also **[gave]{.underline}** Mr
[Putin]{.underline}'s regime and its hangers-on a general sense of
[power]{.underline} and invincibility, [spurring on what we might
call]{.underline} "**[petro-nationalism]{.underline}**".
[These]{.underline} same [gains weakened the leverage of Western
countries]{.underline}, as access to their markets and investment became
less and less important to Russia's economic well-being. We can find, in
all this, answers to two key questions: [when will this war
end]{.underline}? And when will we see a normalisation of the political
regime in Russia? The answer is [when the oil]{.underline} and gas
[revenues are]{.underline} [significantly **reduced**]{.underline}. But
it is likely to take more than one year of falling prices (such years
have occurred three times in the past 20). It would take three, four or
maybe five years to bring about the sharp fall in living standards and
shortage of money in the economy that would force ordinary Russians and
the elites to conclude once and for all that the regime is a busted
flush and to seek political and economic alternatives.
