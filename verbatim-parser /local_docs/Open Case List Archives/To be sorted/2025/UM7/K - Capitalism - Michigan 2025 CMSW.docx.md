Thanks to Maria, Fiona, Serena, Kara, Reyha, Claire, Lucas, Alex, Emily,
and Pau for their hard work on the file.\
Given that so many labs were writing the cap K, this one focuses on
creating link walls and specific links to the affs that have already
been turned out by the camp.

Special thanks to Lucas for organizing the file.

**Thesis**

The central thesis of this file is that capitalism is the root cause of
a systemic \"triangle of extinction\" composed of environmental
destruction (e.g., climate change, pandemics), militarism (e.g., nuclear
war), and capitalist economic imperatives. This triangle creates
existential threats that jeopardize the survival of humanity. The file's
ev argues that capitalism's drive for profit inherently leads to
ecological collapse, war, and social inequality. They claim reform is
insufficient, and the only viable solution is to organize for a
revolutionary transformation away from capitalism toward democratic
eco-socialism or communism. The file advocates for rejecting capitalist
frameworks and embracing systemic alternatives as the prerequisite for
long-term planetary and human survival.

Capitalism drives U.S. exploration and development in the Arctic by
incentivizing the pursuit of untapped natural resources, such as oil,
gas, and rare minerals, that promise significant economic returns. As
climate change opens new shipping lanes and exposes previously
inaccessible terrain, corporations and investors see the Arctic as a
frontier for profit. This profit motive aligns with U.S. geopolitical
interests, fueling a race to assert dominance and secure commercial
advantage. In this way, capitalist imperatives shape both policy
decisions and environmental risk-taking in the region.

Expanding capitalist competition into the Arctic intensifies
environmental degradation, threatening fragile ecosystems already
vulnerable to climate change. As nations and corporations rush to
exploit resources, the risk of oil spills, habitat destruction, and
geopolitical conflict increases, potentially turning the region into a
flashpoint for global tension. This unchecked drive for profit
undermines long-term sustainability and Indigenous sovereignty.

The alternative is to fiat a movement capable of overthrowing
capitalism. You are to use framework to limit permutations, and position
the debate to focus on the central thesis of the desirability of
capitalism versus socialism.

#### Capitalism causes [cascading]{.underline} and [systemic]{.underline} risks, culminating in [extinction]{.underline}. 

Dr. Charles **Derber 23**, Sociology Professor at Boston College; Suren
Moodliar, Managing Editor from the Research Group on Socialism and
Democracy, "Dying for Capitalism How Big Money Fuels Extinction and What
We Can Do About It," https://doi.org/10.4324/9781003401483

[[**Human extinction** is]{.mark} now a **very real
possibility**]{.underline} with underlying causes rooted in the deepest
systems of our society. However, while parts of the extinction crisis
are in clear view, most people around the world have not put together a
clear map of [the "extinction system,"]{.underline} which [has been
denied or **obscured** by many of the world's most **powerful
people**]{.underline} and institutions, [particularly in the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates.

In this chapter, we discuss the hidden triangle, a causal chain showing
how [the **[looming]{.mark} prospect** of **extinction** is [driven
by]{.mark}]{.underline} three major [**[intertwined threats]{.mark}** to
all life]{.underline}. The triangle is a global system, and [**imperils
life** across the **entire world**]{.underline}, with national triangles
also existing in each country. It is largely invisible in most nations,
and especially in the United States, a matter of overwhelming importance
since the United States is the dominant global power and creates the
most toxic triangle. Saving humanity, saving ourselves, cannot happen
without exposing the triangle and overcoming it -- in the United States
and the entire world.

As discussed in the Introduction, we are not defining existential
threats and extinction as only those leading to the total destruction of
all humanity and life on the planet. Following Bostrom's analysis, we
look at a range of catastrophic threats which, in Bostrom's definition,
"would either annihilate earth-originating intelligent life or
permanently and drastically curtail its potential."1 The "bang" form
involves sudden total destruction of all life, but the "crunch, shriek
and whimper" threats are more prolonged and varied, allowing some
survival but restricting life and human development to the point that
they can be seen as a "softer" form of extinction.

The idea of [a **global extinction** triangle **[linking
cap]{.mark}italism**, **[environmental
destruction]{.mark}**]{.underline} (including [**[climate]{.mark}
change**, **[pandemics]{.mark}**, and **[biod]{.mark}**iversity
collapse]{.underline}), and [militarism (especially **[nuclear
war]{.mark}**)]{.underline} will be viewed in many nations, and
especially the United States, as itself madness. It is so taboo that
most analysts of climate crisis, pandemics such as COVID-19, and nuclear
war -- and indeed much of the climate and peace movements -- avoid the
subject of the capitalist system and the need for systemic
transformation like the plague.

To take just climate, the notion that [the capitalist system **drives
climate change**]{.underline} is highlighted by only a few leading
analysts, mainly on the Left. One is Naomi Klein, who argues that
extinction arises from "the collision between capitalism and the planet"
and that:

We have not done the things that are necessary [to **[lower
emissions]{.mark}**]{.underline} because those things fundamentally
[[**conflict** with]{.mark} **deregulated
[cap]{.mark}italism**]{.underline}, the reigning ideology for the entire
period we have been struggling to find a way out of this crisis. We are
stuck because the [[actions that]{.mark} would give us the best chance
of **[avert]{.mark}ing catastrophe**]{.underline} -- and would benefit
the vast majority -- [are extremely **[threaten]{.mark}ing** to an
**[elite minority]{.mark}**]{.underline} that has a stranglehold over
our economy, our political process, and most of our major media
outlets.2

Klein acknowledges that "autocratic industrial socialism" can also cause
climate change, but argues that [the ruling capitalist model is the
major risk and **[we need]{.mark}** to pursue a democratic]{.underline}
"**[eco-[socialism]{.mark}]{.underline}**" [to **save the
planet**.]{.underline}

Joining Klein in the laser-like but lonely focus on the capitalist DNA
driving extinction is the journalist, George Monbiot. He writes that:

Ecologically, economically and politically, capitalism is failing as
catastrophically as communism failed. Like state communism, it is beset
by unacknowledged but fatal contradictions. It is inherently corrupt and
corrupting. But its mesmerising power, and the vast infrastructure of
thought that seeks to justify it, makes any challenge to the model
almost impossible to contemplate. Even to acknowledge the emergencies it
causes, let alone to act on them, feels like electoral suicide. As the
famous saying goes: "[It is easier to imagine the end of the world than
to imagine the end of capitalism." Our urgent task is to turn this the
other way round]{.underline}.3

Monbiot is not joking when he says our most important task is to "turn
this the other way round." While this sounds daunting, imagining
[**systemic change** in the global **capitalist economy** has become
**essential** to **human survival**.]{.underline} In a period when there
is a new awakening about "systemic racism," [we need now to **expand**
our **consciousness** about our economy]{.underline}, recognizing that
we are now living in a new stage of "extinction capitalism." [Only
systemic change in our political economy can **save us**]{.underline}.

Klein is Canadian and Monbiot is British. These are both societies where
it has long been possible to offer critiques of capitalism without
sounding like a crackpot. Both Britain and Canada have labor or
socialist parties, and mainstreamed the idea that large parts of the
society should be separated from profit-making and organized for the
provision of public goods. These societies are less complicit than the
United States in climate and military policies fueling extinction.

In the United States, mainstream socialist political parties do not
exist, and "big government" and universal welfare programs are seen as
enemies of liberty, with the exception of an enormous military. Klein
and Monbiot have an audience in the United States, but their views that
[[**to survive** means **moving beyond
cap**]{.mark}**italism**]{.underline} and especially neoliberalism
capitalism runs into huge hurdles, especially in American political
discourse, even among liberals. However, we shall see that it is not an
impossible dream, and that even a President as moderate as Joe Biden,
pushed by people of color, young people, and social movements, has begun
to break with neoliberalism and shift toward a public goods economy that
could help save the planet.

Crossing the Threshold: Humanity Confronts Its Final Stage

Beginning in the mid-1940s, when the United States attacked Japan with
nuclear weapons, we saw the emergence of the first period in human
history -- now known as the Anthropocene -- in which capitalism began to
threaten both nuclear and climate extinction. As Noam Chomsky writes:

Review of the record reveals clearly that [[escape]{.underline}]{.mark}
from catastrophe [for seventy years [has been a]{.mark} near
**[miracle]{.mark}**]{.underline} and such [**miracles cannot be
trusted** to perpetuate]{.underline}.

On that grim day in August 1945, humanity entered into a new era, [the
**nuclear age**]{.underline}. It's one that's [**unlikely** to **last
long**]{.underline}, either we will bring it to an end or [it's likely
to **bring us** to an **end**]{.underline}. It was evident at once that
any hope of containing the demon would require international corporation
....

It was not understood at the time but a second and no less critical new
era was beginning at the same time. A new geological epoch, by now,
called the Anthropocene--an epoch defined by extreme human impact on the
environment.

The Anthropocene and the nuclear age coincide, a dual threat to the
perpetuation of organized human life. Both threats are severe and
imminent. It's widely recognized that we have entered the period of the
sixth mass extinction.4

Extinction denialism has limited public awareness of the new stage that
arose in the late 1940s but is rooted in the foundations of our economic
system. Indeed, [[**capitalism**, even as it]{.underline}]{.mark}
historically [[helped]{.underline}]{.mark} build new economic [growth
and **[innovation]{.mark}**]{.underline} and pulled millions out of
poverty, [has always **[created war]{.mark}** and **environmental
destruction**]{.underline}. Its historical progress fueled "development"
that catapulted the European and American world toward prosperity and
material well-being for two centuries. But [that]{.underline} huge leap
forward also [froze into society an **[unsustainable]{.mark} quest** for
**unfettered [growth]{.mark}**]{.underline} threatening military and
environmental catastrophe and externalized multiple costs onto the
peoples of the Global South. The history of [capitalist successes
disguised **latent crises** now **surfacing** in the **extinction
stage**. The historical **benefits** of **capitalism** have not
**disappeared**, but their **relative value** has **declined** compared
to the **costs** and risks -- ultimately of **extinction**]{.underline}.

The Triangle of Extinction: Mad Money

To save humanity and all life on the planet, we need to understand the
new extinction stage as rooted in a causal triangle of three intertwined
threats. The only way that humanity will survive is if the world --
including all states, peoples, and social movements -- come together to
dismantle the triangle and create a new circle of sustainable life
systems.

[[Cap]{.mark}italism [drives]{.mark}]{.underline} the triangle of
extinction. Its very nature, as a system, foments
**[[militarism]{.underline}]{.mark}** and drives environmental
destruction. In Chapter 2, we argue that [capitalism's constant need [to
expand]{.mark} both [its **resource base** and]{.mark} its
**[markets]{.mark}** fosters a militarism to pry open markets [and
**"protect" investments**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Territorial expansion
across national borders has a corollary in the [capitalist dynamic to
test [and **break ecological thresholds**]{.mark}]{.underline},
producing the third corner of the triangle, environmental destruction.

However, these two corners -- militarism and environmental destruction
also feed back into, affect, and reinforce the logic of capitalism. Both
create the disasters that leave communities and states turning to
capitalists for solutions. The soil fertility depletion, for example,
that capitalist agriculture produces, leaves us all more dependent on
the petrochemical and agro-industrial corporations selling fertilizers
and pesticides. Similarly, [capitalism's inherent instability,
particularly in the American case, produces a "**military
[Keynesianism]{.mark}**[," using **state spending** to
**increase**]{.mark} **production** and [profits of **military
companies**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This, in turn, compromises democracy,
giving weapons contractors privileged access to the state, rendering the
latter dependent on the "market" fortunes of these corporations (Figure
1.1).

\[Figure 1.1 Omitted\]

Figure 1.1 The Triangle of Extinction, Basic Version

As we contemplate this triangle, we must recognize that its dynamics
play out in social and historical structures that are profoundly
intersectional, ones characterized at the global, regional, and national
levels by evolving hierarchies including those of race, gender, class,
and states. A more complete picture of the triangle therefore looks like
this (Figure 1.2)

Long Description for Figure 1.2

Figure 1.2 The Triangle of Extinction, Expanded Version

This second diagram spells out the variety of forms of environmental
destruction and militarism that create existential and extinction
threats, whether they be, in Bostrom's terms, forms of bang, crunch,
shriek, or whimper risks. In both pictures, we are adhering to the idea
that existential threats -- and extinction itself -- should not be
defined exclusively as total annihilation.

The second picture shows that there are several major existential risks;
among the risks in the environmental destruction corner are three
well-known ones, climate change, pandemics, and biodiversity loss. But
these interact with the others listed, as well as with the many other
risks that are less well known. Similarly, [militarism [produces
**nuclear**, **bio**]{.mark}**logical**/[**chemical**, and
**cyberwar**]{.mark} **risks**]{.underline}. All of these six varieties
of existential risk are extremely important, and **[[all are
"systemic"]{.underline}]{.mark}** in that they are partly caused [and
**fueled** by the]{.underline} United States and global **[capitalist
system]{.underline}**. All deserve urgent study leading to emergency
transformative change because each of them could create devastating mass
death from which humanity might not be able to recover. In addition to
these six existential risks, the clusters around each corner of the
second diagram also name other risks that may escalate into either
existential risks or radically reduce the quality of life and pose
civilizational risks.

In this book, mainly to keep the book shorter, we do not analyze
biodiversity collapse, cyber war, or biological war, focusing instead on
nuclear war, climate change, and pandemics. If we were to write a second
volume, we would analyze with the same sense of urgency the other three
incredibly dangerous threats; they are growing and increasingly
intertwined with the threats we focus on here.

The arrows in the diagrams reflect causation. Capitalism itself creates
a threat of extinction, independent of environmental death and war. But
it also causes and fuels the environmental threats of climate change,
pandemics, and loss of biodiversity, which multiply the extinction
threat. And capitalism, especially the militarized hegemonic form
modeled by US neoliberal capitalism, causes war, which further
multiplies the extinction threat embedded in the possibility of nuclear
war. Climate change, pandemics, and extreme war could arise from other
systems than capitalism, but [capitalism is a leading cause and
accelerator of all these threats, which in turn [**intensify** the
extinction **dangers** of **each other**. Climate change is a]{.mark}
**major [driver]{.mark}** [of **war** and war]{.mark} has become a
**leading [cause]{.mark}** [of **climate**]{.mark}
**change**]{.underline}. Scholarship on climate change and broader
environmental matters typically recognize several major tipping points
and environmental thresholds beyond which abrupt and catastrophic
outcomes are to be expected. While we do explore these in depth, we
consider these important aspects of the three corners of the triangle of
extinction.5

#### Vote neg in favor of organizing a [united revolution]{.underline} against capitalism.

John **Peterson 23**, Community organizer and Executive Editor at
Socialist Revolution, "The Communists Are Here!,"
https://socialistrevolution.org/the-communists-are-here/

In the February issue of Socialist Revolution, we wrote:

[The [**communists** are]{.mark}]{.underline}, indeed,
**[[coming]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And they're coming, [**not** to
**reform capitalism**, but to **abolish it**. They're coming
by]{.underline} ones and twos, dozens, hundreds, and
[thousands]{.underline}, shaped by their life experience in this system.
[The International Marxist Tendency is working to organize]{.underline}
and train [them]{.underline} in Marxist theory and Bolshevik methods.
History is on our side, and we have nothing to hide. We are proud to
reject the status quo and to fight for a better future for humanity.

Fast forward a few months [[through]{.mark} a summer of **[climate
disasters]{.mark}**]{.underline}, grinding [**imperialist
[war]{.mark}**, defiant **labor [strikes]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark}
intensifying political and **economic
[instability]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and [**[consciousness]{.mark}** has
been **[transformed]{.mark}** even further. [An **entire
generation**]{.mark} of **young workers** [is **desperate** to **find a
way out**]{.mark}]{.underline} of the impasse. [**Disillusioned** by the
cowardice]{.underline} and prevarication [of class-collaborationist
liberal "socialists" like Bernie Sanders and AOC, millions are
seeking]{.underline} far more **[radical solutions]{.underline}**.

**[[Recent polls]{.underline}]{.mark}** have [[revealed]{.mark} the
**depth** and **breadth** of this **sentiment**]{.underline}, with [28%
of [**Gen Z** and]{.mark} 22% of [**Millennials** expressing a
**favorable view** of **"communism"**]{.mark} and even more viewing
"Marxism" positively]{.underline}, according to the Victims of Communism
Memorial Foundation. And according to the Fraser Institute, [20% of
those aged 18--34 believe "**communism** is the **ideal economic
system**]{.underline}. Reactionary pundits like Sam Abodo of the
Washington Examiner lament that "\[those\] young Americans who view
communism favorably are either ignorant or cold-hearted." He blames a
"failure of education" for these shifting views. But the cause of these
trends is not a failure of education, but the failure of capitalism.

These [polls]{.underline} are not merely anecdotal; they [reveal a
dramatically **[shifting worldview]{.mark}**. Behind]{.underline} those
[percentages are **[millions]{.mark}** of **young people**, [seething
with **discontent**]{.mark} and wondering en masse: "Is this really all
that life offers?"]{.underline} Three years [[after the **defeat** of
**B**]{.underline}]{.mark}lack **[[L]{.underline}]{.mark}**ives
**[[M]{.underline}]{.mark}**atter, [**disenchanted [despair]{.mark}**
[is being **transformed** into **class rage**]{.mark} [and]{.mark} a
**burning [desire]{.mark}**]{.underline} to do something. Not just
anything, mind you---but [to turn the world upside down]{.underline}.

[The [**strength** of these]{.mark} **fresh [forces]{.mark}** [lies in
their **numbers**]{.mark}, **fighting [spirit]{.mark}**[, and
willingness]{.mark} to **smash all obstacles** to change the
world]{.underline}. However, although capitalism creates communists,
experience shows that [[**spontaneity** and **revolution**]{.mark}**ary
élan** [are **not enough**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and that [a **[lack of
organization]{.mark}** and **theoretical education** [can be **fatal**
when **confronting**]{.mark}]{.underline} the centralized power [of [the
**capitalists**]{.mark}]{.underline} and their state.

In the years since Bernie's betrayal, right-populist demagogues have
filled the vacuum where combative class politics should be. This has its
limits and the right cannot hold that ground indefinitely. However, if a
viable Bolshevik alternative is not built the coming period, millions
may swing towards the shipwreck of "communist" ultraleftism. By moving
too quickly ahead of the rest of the class, [[even an
**organization**]{.mark} of 100,000 [could find itself **isolated** from
the **masses**]{.mark} and [**unable** to play the role of
**revolutionary catalyst**]{.mark}---with disastrous
consequences]{.underline}. The IMT aims to [**cut across** this dynamic
by]{.underline} energetically [**organizing** and
**training**]{.underline} thousands of [young class
fighters]{.underline} in the ideas and methods of genuine communism. [If
we are t[o **harness**]{.mark} all of this [**energy** into
**revolution**]{.mark}**ary change**, [we must come out]{.mark} swinging
[as the boldest **critics** of **cap**]{.mark}**italism** while
[offering]{.mark} **revolutionary**]{.underline} class-struggle
solutions and **[[organization]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[For this [we need]{.mark}]{.underline} political [clarity, [**starting
with** an **understanding** of what **communism** is]{.mark} and
isn't]{.underline}, and its relation to socialism. Although
**[socialism]{.underline}** went mainstream over the last few years, its
real content has been watered down, made wishy-washy and vague by those
who think capitalism can be tinkered with and reformed without
abolishing private property of the means of production. Instead, they
[soften its razor's edge and **blur** the **lines** of **class
collaboration.**]{.underline} In his inimitable way, Lenin rebuked these
enemies of genuine socialism and class struggle:

The dialectics of history were such that the theoretical victory of
Marxism compelled its enemies to disguise themselves as Marxists.
Liberalism, rotten within, tried to revive itself in the form of
socialist opportunism. They interpreted the period of preparing the
forces for great battles as renunciation of these battles. Improvement
of the conditions of the slaves to fight against wage slavery they took
to mean the sale by the slaves of their right to liberty for a few
pence. They cravenly preached "social peace" (i.e., peace with the
slave-owners), renunciation of the class struggle, etc. They had very
many adherents among socialist members of parliament, various officials
of the working-class movement, and the "sympathizing" intelligentsia.

As Marx explained, socialism is merely the "first" or "lower" phase of
communist society, the transitional period that bridges the present
world of capitalism and the classless, stateless communism of the
future. And as Trotsky put it in his comments on The Communist
Manifesto:

"When, in the course of development, class distinctions have
disappeared, and all production has been concentrated in the hands of a
vast association of the whole nation, the public power will lose its
political character." In other words: the state withers away. Society
remains, freed from the straitjacket. This is nothing else but
socialism.

Contrary to the fiction peddled by the pro-Democratic Party reformists,
[**genuine [socialism]{.mark}** [is **not**]{.mark} about **modest
[redistribution]{.mark}** [within]{.mark} the **confines** of
**[cap]{.mark}italism**. [It is
**revolution**]{.mark}**ary**]{.underline} and internationalist [and
represents [a]{.mark} fundamental [**rupture** with]{.mark} capitalist
**[property relations]{.mark}** and the status quo]{.underline}. While
the personal property of the vast majority will not be touched, [the
essential **backbone** of [the **economy** must be]{.mark} brought into
**[public]{.mark} ownership** [and]{.mark} **planned
[democratic]{.mark}ally** and rationally]{.underline}. On this basis, we
can build a world in which society's guiding principle is "from each
according to his ability, to each according to his needs."

Adding to the confusion are those who have usurped and misused the terms
"communist" and "Marxist-Leninist." We must be clear that Stalinism in
its various forms was a counterrevolutionary aberration and historical
dead end leading only to capitalist restoration. Genuine [[communism
is]{.underline}]{.mark} about [human liberation and **material
[superabundance]{.mark}**, not **bureaucratic privilege**, **police
terror**, and **scarcity**]{.underline}.

Thankfully, most of [the **young generation**]{.underline} have moved
beyond this inanity and [are **attracted** by]{.underline} the real
essence of **[communism]{.underline}**, not its totalitarian caricature.
Nonetheless, some still harbor illusions in this brand of
Menshevik-liberal class collaboration in radical clothing, and have no
real understanding of the events that transpired after Lenin's death. In
his classic exposé, "Stalinism and Bolshevism," written at the height of
Stalin's purges, Trotsky set the record straight on these gravediggers
of the revolution:

To be sure, in a formal sense Stalinism did issue from Bolshevism. Even
today, the Moscow bureaucracy continues to call itself the Bolshevik
party. It is simply using the old label of Bolshevism the better to fool
the masses. So much the more pitiful are those theoreticians who take
the shell for the kernel and appearance for reality. In the
identification of Bolshevism and Stalinism, they render the best
possible service to the \[counterrevolution\] and precisely thereby play
a clearly reactionary role...

The present purge draws between Bolshevism and Stalinism, not simply a
bloody line but a whole river of blood. The annihilation of all the
older generation of Bolsheviks, an important part of the middle
generation which participated in the civil war, and that part of the
youth that took up most seriously the Bolshevik traditions, shows not
only a political but a thoroughly physical incompatibility between
Bolshevism and Stalinism. How can this not be seen?

As for Marxism, it is a revolutionary worldview that scientifically
analyzes nature and society in their contradictory motion, change, and
development. To be a genuine Marxist is to be a revolutionary communist
and an implacable enemy of exploitation and oppression in all its forms.
It means having confidence in the working class and its potential to
transform the world. And Trotskyism is merely the continuation of
revolutionary Bolshevism and communism in the interwar period. It is no
accident that Trotsky was murdered on Stalin's orders, along with
thousands of other leaders and participants in the October Revolution.

The IMT is proud to trace our political lineage through Trotsky and
Lenin to the authors of The Communist Manifesto. History has come full
circle in the 175 years since that founding document was published, and
on a much higher plane. The objective conditions for socialist
revolution and communism are rotten-ripe, and the subjective factor is
maturing rapidly. Such historic junctures do not last forever, and we
cannot afford to miss any more George Floyd moments. As the pace of
history accelerates, humanity is approaching a decisive crossroads, and
[[we **must** have]{.mark} a **sense of [urgency!]{.mark}**]{.underline}
Fortunately, [the **communists** are]{.underline} not merely coming---we
[are **already here**]{.underline}---and [we invite you to get organized
in **our ranks**]{.underline}.

"[[All things are subject to interpretation]{.underline}]{.mark};
whichever interpretation prevails at a given time is a function of power
and not truth." --- Friedrich Nietzsche

"**[[Words make worlds]{.underline}]{.mark}**."

[[The language of development defines
worlds-in-the-making]{.underline}]{.mark}, animating and justifying
intervention in currently existing worlds with fulsome promises of the
possible. Wolfgang Sachs contends, "[[development]{.underline}]{.mark}
is much more than just a socio-economic endeavour; it [[is a perception
which models]{.mark} [reality, a myth which comforts societies, and a
fantasy which unleashes passions]{.mark}]{.underline}" (1992:1).

These models, myths, and passions are [sustained by development's
"buzzwords."]{.underline} Writing from diverse locations, contributors
to this special issue critically examine a selection of the words that
constitute today's development lexicon. Whereas those who contributed to
Sachs' 1992 landmark publication The Development Dictionary shared a
project of dismantling the edifice of development, this collection is
deliberately eclectic in its range of voices, positions, and
perspectives.

Some tell tales of the trajectories that these words have travelled, as
they have moved from one domain of discourse to another; others describe
scenes in which the ironies -- absurdities, at times -- of their usage
beg closer critical attention; others peel off the multiple guises that
their words have assumed, and analyse the dissonant agendas that they
embrace.

Our intention in [bringing them together]{.underline} is to [leave
you]{.underline}, the reader, [feeling less than equivocal
about]{.underline} taking for [granted the words that frame the
world-making projects of]{.underline} the [development]{.underline}
enterprise.

The Lexicon of Development

For those involved in development practice, reflection on words and
their meanings may seem irrelevant to the real business of getting
things done. Why, after all, should language matter to those who are
doing development?

As long as those involved in development practice are familiar with the
catch-words that need to be sprinkled liberally in funding proposals and
emblazoned on websites and promotional material, then surely there are
more important things to be done than sit around mulling over questions
of semantics?

But [**[language does matter for development]{.underline}**.
[Development's buzzwords are not only passwords to funding and
influence]{.underline}]{.mark}[; and they are more than the mere
specialist jargon that is characteristic of any profession.]{.underline}

[[The word development itself]{.mark},]{.underline} Gilbert Rist
observes, has become a "modern shibboleth, an unavoidable password,"
which comes to be used "to [c[onvey the idea that]{.underline}]{.mark}
[tomorrow things will be better, or that [more is necessarily
better]{.mark}.]{.underline}" But, as he goes on to note, the very
taken-for-granted quality of "development"---and the same might be said
of [[many of the words that are used in development discourse---leaves
much of what is actually done in its name
unquestioned]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Many of the words that have gained the status of buzzwords in
development are (or once were) what the philosopher W.B. Gallie (1956)
termed "essentially contested concepts": terms that combine general
agreement on the abstract notion that they represent with endless
disagreement about what they might mean in practice.

Yet the very contestability of many of the words in the lexicon of
development has been "flattened," as Neera Chandhoke suggests for civil
society: terms about which there was once vibrant disagreement have
become "consensual hurrah-words" (Chandhoke, this issue).

[[Development's]{.underline}]{.mark} buzzwords gain their purchase and
power through their vague and euphemistic qualities, their [[capacity to
embrace a multitude of possible meanings]{.underline}]{.mark}, and their
normative resonance. The work that these words do for development is to
[[place the sanctity of its goals beyond reproach.]{.underline}]{.mark}

INTRODUCTION

[[**Persuasion** happens in]{.underline}]{.mark} both [the [**brain**
and]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[body]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Departing
from a Cartesian view of rationality, neuroscience explains that the
mind and the body are highly integrated. It is a [[**fallacy** to
believe]{.mark} that]{.underline} [[we engage with **arguments** in
an]{.mark} abstract]{.underline}, analytical, and [[**unemotional**
fashion]{.underline}]{.mark}. Instead, neuroscience explains that when
[[rhetoric **influences** us]{.underline}]{.mark}, it does so [in an
**embodied** way]{.underline}, [[triggering electrochemical
**reactions**]{.underline}]{.mark} that traverse our neural pathways,
[[beyond]{.underline}]{.mark} the purview of our [[**conscious**
thought]{.underline}]{.mark}. Although it sounds like a science fiction
concept, the biological and embodied nature of rhetoric is in line with
the beliefs of the ancient Sophists, who understood rhetoric to have the
same kind of effect on the brain as a drug. This ancient understanding,
that rhetoric can infiltrate the human body, is another instance where
ancient knowledge [**aligns** with modern **scientific**
theory]{.underline}.\'

\<\<CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

Neurorhetoric is the study of how rhetoric shapes the human brain. At
the forefront of science and communication studies, neurorhetoric
challenges many preconceptions about how humans respond to persuasive
stimuli. Neurorhetoric can be applied to a multiplicity of relevant
legal issues, including the topic of this Symposium Issue: race and
advocacy. After detailing the neuroscientific and cognitive theories
that underlie neurorhetoric, this Essay theorizes ways in which
neurorhetoric intersects with the law, advocacy, and race. This Essay
explores how toxic racial stereotypes and categories become embedded in
the human brain and what can be done about it. This Essay, which
examines the way that language creates thought patterns that can become
collectively entrenched, is especially relevant in our extremely
divisive political age. For instance, President Donald Trump\'s campaign
drew upon negative stereotypes about minorities by crafting an us vs.
them dichotomy to ,foment political support.2 As discussed below, these
either/or thought patterns, adopted collectively, are what fueled the
totalitarian and fascist regimes prior to World War II. And it is not
just right-wing western political rhetoric that threatens. The Islamic
State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) also employs highly effective rhetorical
tactics of inclusion and exclusion, defining a community of Muslims (the
Ummah) who must join in jihad against the kuft camp, all those
individuals existing outside the Ummah. ISIS\'s rhetoric, diffused
online through multiple media platforms, effectively draws in
disaffected youth from all over the world to join the movement, become
part of the community, and massacre those outside of the community.3 The
harmful rhetoric used to describe racial minorities and other
subordinated groups produces toxic thought patterns that can become
entrenched in the public mind. For instance, as this Essay explains in
more detail below, when overt racism lost political credibility in the
1970s, conservative political operatives began using coded categories to
link racial minorities with enduring negative stereotypes. For example,
the term \"Welfare Queen\" automatically conjures up racialized images
that reify existing power structures in a rapid and unconscious way. The
term quickly captures complex ideas concerning the undeserving versus
deserving poor, the racialized and feminized nature of poverty in the
United States, and longstanding historical stereotypes about race, work,
and family.\'4 Neuroscience explains why and how racially coded
categories are so efficient: they create neural pathways that, upon
continued use, become collectively entrenched. An entrenched neural
pathway offers a smooth and rapid path for a conclusory message to reach
an individual\'s consciousness. Coded categories are harmful because
they encourage rapid unconscious thinking that has the effect of
hardwiring stereotypes into the pathways of the brain. The rapid way in
which a term raises these unspoken conclusions makes it difficult to
imagine other narrative possibilities or engage in reasoned deliberation
about the issue. This Essay explores six thoughts related to
neurorhetoric, the law, and race. First, this Essay generally explains
the cognitive science and neuroscience theories that form the foundation
of neurorhetoric, describing how rhetoric enters and interacts with the
human brain and body. Second, from a historical perspective, this Essay
explores how racialized rhetoric can be used to produce collective brain
pathways that dehumanizes entire groups of people-a frightening process
that sheds light on the widespread acquiescence to genocide and racial
annihilation, such as what occurred in the Holocaust. The third point
fleshes out the intersection between neurorhetoric and race in the
United States, with a specific focus on how U.S. racial stereotypes
become embedded in the collective brainscape. The fourth point addresses
neurorhetoric and the law, detailing law\'s unique power to reify
concepts, which makes the law an especially potent type of embodied
rhetoric. Building upon the previous discussion, the fifth point
provides three concrete examples of how neurorhetoric connects with the
law and race-in the courtroom, in recent tragedies involving police
shootings of black men, and in the term \"alien,\" a toxic legal
category that castigates and dehumanizes immigrant groups. Finally, this
Essay concludes with a theory of hope. To the extent that rhetoric
produces collective neural pathways that reinforce racial oppression and
subordination, the identification and deployment of alternative
discourses have the potential to carve out healing pathways that can
reshape brains, both individually and collectively. To that end, this
Essay proposes a novel approach to legal rhetoric: a comparative
approach that might uncover alternative discourses that can be infused
into the law, carving out healing brain pathways and devitalizing
pernicious pathways.

I. DEVELOPING THE DISCIPLINE OF NEURORHETORIC

A. The Foundation: Conceptions of Rhetoric

Neurorhetoric is a new discipline that applies neuroscience to
understand how [[rhetoric]{.mark} **stimulates**]{.underline} [activity
that [can]{.mark}]{.underline} actually [change the **[shape]{.mark}**
and **form** of [the **brain**]{.mark}]{.underline}. To set the
foundation, it is useful to return to the original understanding of the
term rhetoric. Ancient Greek rhetoricians defined rhetoric as the [art
of **[persuasion]{.mark}**]{.underline} and/or a [process for
discovering truth [by **argumentation**]{.mark}]{.underline}.\' This
conception of rhetoric is fairly narrow, in contrast to the word\'s
original etymology. Rhetoric derives from the Greek word \"eird,\" or
\"I say.\" Rhetoric could mean \"\[a\]lmost anything related to the act
of saying something to someone . \... The point here is that rhetoric
relates to language, conversation, words, and even images. A broader
conception of rhetoric complements the ideas in this Essay, which
addresses how [words and phrases become **cemented** inside the
brain]{.underline} in such a way as [to **[influence]{.mark}** [thoughts
and beliefs]{.mark}]{.underline}.

\<\<CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

As a matter of orientation, neurorhetoric sits within the discipline of
modem rhetoric, the study of persuasion and communication in a variety
of contexts-ancient narratives, poetry, literature, popular culture,
film, television, and the news media. Modem rhetoric is also
interdisciplinary, engaging with social and scientific theories to
understand how people are persuaded. Legal rhetoric, described more
fully below, studies persuasion in a legal advocacy setting. This Essay
draws upon both modem rhetoric studies and legal rhetoric disciplines.
B. The Mind: Cognitive Rhetoric and Cognitive Science Neurorhetoric
descends from cognitive rhetoric, the application of cognitive science,
or the study of \"how people conceptualize the world\[,\]\" to rhetoric.
Cognitive rhetoric might be understood as the generalized study of how
the human mind responds to persuasive stinuli.8 Cognitive rhetoric is
often focused on two fundamental concepts-metaphors and categories.
Metaphors and categories are devices that help humans streamline
thoughts when confronted with complex information.\' A metaphor allows
the human mind to connect one concept to another in an automatic and
embodied way.o The metaphor of more correlating with up (positive) and
less correlating with down (negative) exemplifies a concept that has
become deeply connected to the mind, the body, and the physical
environment.\" When we remark that things are \"looking up\" to express
a positive outlook, we are expressing an embodied metaphor, without
realizing the connection between the positivity and the upwards
direction. Moreover, the directional shifts, up or down, reflect the
physical way that the metaphor bridges connections between our minds and
our physical bodies. Categories are often comprised of one or more
associative metaphors. We \"pick out parts of our experience and treat
them as discrete entities or substances of a uniform kind.\"1 2 For
instance, when we categorize someone as motherly or maternal, we apply
widely shared physical experiences to give a category a metaphorical
meaning. The understanding that a maternal person is a warm and caring
person stems from early childhood experiences that have become deeply
embodied. As infants (for most but not all individuals), we associated
our mother with warmth, food, and nurturance. This example illustrates
how the connectedness of the two conceptsmotherhood with warmth and
caring-arose from our bodily experiences.13 Like metaphors, categories
function unconsciously and rapidly. 14 Lakoff and Johnson explain:
Understanding our experiences in terms of objects and substances allows
us to pick out parts of our experience and treat them as discrete
entities or substances of a uniform kind. Once we can identify our
experiences as entities or substances, we can refer to them, categorize
them, group them, and quantify them-and, by this means, reason about
them.\" When we are confronted with a category, our mind quickly grasps
the complexity of the concept. We simplify complex information when the
various parts of the concept come together in one unified whole.
Further, categories do not always reflect objective truths about the
material world; rather, they may be based on subjective choices that
reflect one\'s culture or individual experience.\' 6 Culture can produce
unified categories that function as metaphorical \"code\" for more
implicit concepts. 17 For example, when we use the category \"unwed
mother\" or \"working mother,\" our mind quickly latches onto the
majoritarian cultural values associated with these categories.\' 8 Both
of these categories imply that the mother is less than ideal. Social
stereotypes cognitively function as coded categories, collectively
understood to refer to negative generalizations about a social or racial
group.\' 9 Social and racial stereotypes rely on metonymy, the concept
that some or a few attributes of a category stand for the whole. 2 0 In
her masterful article, Deadbeat Dads & Welfare Queens: How Metaphor
Shapes Poverty Law, Professor Ann Cammett utilizes cognitive rhetoric to
explain the \"Welfare Queen\" epithet, which conveyed a powerful,
racially coded message generating political disfavor for social welfare
legislation in the 1970s.21 The Welfare Queen trope developed out of a
1970s news story concerning an unmarried mother who fraudulently used
aliases to obtain welfare benefits in the 1970s, abusing the benefits
system to amass cash and wealth.2 2 Ronald Reagan repeatedly popularized
the term in stump speeches, raising ire directed toward the Welfare
Queen, her cash, and her Cadillac.23 The fraudulent practices of one
welfare recipient became, in metynomic fashion, the category that stood
for all mothers on welfare. The Welfare Queen term relied on the
metaphorical category of mother, but defined mother in the alterity, as
an exemplar of a mother with loose morals and little virtue. 2 4 The
reference to other attributes of category membership-the Cadillac for
instance-functioned to cement an implicit and collective understanding
that mothers on welfare were primarily black, even though the majority
of those on public assistance at the time were white.25 With one shot
over the bow, the Welfare Queen rhetoric generated a synthesis of
negative racial stereotypes about struggling mothers living in poverty.
In historical context, the Welfare Queen example illustrates the
socalled \"Southern Strategy,\" a new type of racially coded rhetoric
deployed by conservative politicians after the civil rights movement
when it became impolite to display overt racism. In an infamous recorded
interview, Lee Atwater, an architect of the Southern Strategy, explained
that in lieu of using racial epithets to foment support (as had been the
practice in the 1930s and 1940s), it was much more effective to utilize
abstract categories like \"forced busing, states\' rights, and all that
stuff,\" which functioned as code words indicating the superior
interests of white citizens over those of black 26 citizens.

\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUME\>\>

C. The Brain: Neuroscience

Building upon cognitive rhetoric, [**neurorhetoric** expands our
understanding of how **persuasion** works]{.underline}, studying how
informational stimuli interact within the neural pathways of the brain.
Neuroscience explains that when we think, electrochemical reactions fire
and are conducted from one place to another in our synapses, the
connective spaces between two neuron cells in our brain. 2 7 This
activity occurs through neural circuits or networks.28 Whereas cognitive
rhetoric might be conceived as the study of how persuasion works in the
mind, neurorhetoric looks at how persuasion works in a biological sense,
in the brain.29

Thus, neurorhetoric seeks to connect neuroscientific understandings of
cognition and thought to rhetoric, adding another layer of understanding
for how meaning is created in the brain. Central to neurorhetoric are
the concepts of neuroplasticity, mapping, and canalization/attenuation.
Neurorhetoric\'s biggest takeaway is the idea that [[**discursive**
stimuli]{.underline}]{.mark} (such as words or categories) can actually
[[impact the]{.mark} **structure** of the
**[brain]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [individually and [on a **mass
scale**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

**[[Neuroplasticity]{.underline}]{.mark}** is the concept that the
[structure of one\'s **brain** can be altered by]{.underline} one\'s
**[experience]{.underline}**. When we think a certain thought or perform
a physical action, our brain\'s neuron cells fire in different areas,
coming together to complete the task. [[As]{.mark} [we **repeat** a
mental operation]{.mark}]{.underline}, these [[neurons **continue** to
fire]{.underline}]{.mark} in different areas [and]{.underline}
eventually [become **fused** together in a network]{.underline} or
circuit.3 0 \"Cells that fire together wire together\" is a pithy quote
that captures the idea of various neural electrical pathways forging
together in a single circuit [based on **repeated**
triggering]{.underline}.

This process of welding different neural paths into one connected path
is [also [known as **mapping**]{.mark}]{.underline}.3 2 For an example,
let us return to the discussion of the mother metaphor, discussed above.
When parts of a baby\'s brain dealing with appetite, physical
temperature, and affection are triggered in the presence of the mother,
a network of connected neural pathways fuse together, linking concepts
of warmth and sustenance with the concept of the child\'s mother.33 As
the infant is repeatedly exposed to the mother who feeds and provides
comfort, these previously separate neural networks become more connected
and entrenched. Eventually, the biological association of \"mother\"
with warmth, nurturance, and caring gives rise to an abstract metaphor,
seen in concepts like \"he\'s a warm person,\" or \"she\'s a block of
ice.\" 34

The [**deepening** of neural pathways [in response to **repeated**
exposure]{.mark} to a stimulus]{.underline} can be [understood
as]{.underline} a process of [**canalization** occurring in the
**plastic** brain]{.underline}. Our [[brains]{.underline}]{.mark} become
\"[**perpetually** [altered]{.mark}]{.underline}\" [[by]{.mark}
[**every** encounter]{.mark}]{.underline} and every interaction.
Canalization of neural paths has been analogized to what happens when
sledding on a snowy hill. The first time one sleds down a hill, new
tracks are made. In subsequent trips down the slope, more likely than
not, one selects a path that has already been forged. The more sledding
that occurs, the deeper the existing tracks become.36 Once we have
created these tracks in the brain, they become \"\'really speedy\' and
very efficient at guiding the sled down the hill.\"37 Once a thought
becomes cemented in the brain, that thought appears with great rapidity
and arises unconsciously.

Once a concept has been synaptically cemented by continued activation of
the same neural pathways by the same stimulus, it becomes highly
difficult to undo. 39 Through a process of attenuation, alternative
pathways in the brain can become cut off.40 This happens because the
development of neural pathways is \"a competitive process, one in which
the connections that are used are kept and those that go unused are
eliminated.\"41 Thus, \"\[o\]nce a particular plastic change occurs in
the brain and becomes well established, it can prevent other changes
from occurring.\" 42

Canalization and attenuation explain how ideas get stuck in our brains.
When mental concepts become canalized, they become deep-seated habits of
thought, which then cut off competing thought patterns.43 The more a
neural pathway becomes entrenched in the brain, the more certainty we
have with respect to the associated thought.4 4 And these ideas can be
good or bad. We have all heard the term \"toxic brain loop.\" In
neuroscience parlance, that concept refers to an entrenched neural
pathway that has cut off more positive thought patterns. But there is
also the possibility that [**healthy** thought patterns can become
**canalized**]{.underline}, which would [implant **positive**
pathways]{.underline} in the brain [but]{.underline}
[weaken]{.underline} more [**negative** patterns]{.underline}.

II\. GETTING HIGH: RHETORIC INSIDE OUR BRAINS AND BODIES

As a stimulus that triggers thought, [**rhetoric** can change the
brain\'s **structure**]{.underline}, [both **individually** and
**collectively**]{.underline}.45 [When]{.underline} we are [asked to
consider a **thought pattern** over and over again]{.underline} (a
common rhetorical strategy), [we are left with a **mark** in our
brains]{.underline}. 46 [[Contrary t]{.mark}o the]{.underline} deeply
held Western [belief that there is a [**separation** between]{.mark} the
[**mind** and]{.mark} the **[body]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[[rhetoric]{.mark} can [get **inside** our brains]{.mark}]{.underline}
and bodies [and make us think]{.underline} and feel things
[[without]{.mark} the intervention of [**conscious**
rationality]{.mark}]{.underline}. In a nutshell, neurorhetoric
challenges traditional conceptions of reason and choice.4 7

The embodied nature of thought helps explain how deeply rhetoric
influences us. [[Thought is **embodied**]{.underline}]{.mark}; our
thoughts are deeply [**interconnected** [to our **physical**
bodies]{.mark}]{.underline}.48 For instance, when we read something that
asks us to imagine a scene or when we view a film, we use the same
neural structure of our brain that we use when living out that scene.4 9
As George Lakoff and Mark Johnson describe, \"When we imagine seeing a
scene, our visual cortex is active. When we imagine moving our bodies,
the pre-motor cortex and motor cortex are active. \"50

The concept of having a \"gut feeling\" about a particular outcome
reflects the embodied nature of thought. Neuroscientist Antonio Damasio
devised the term \"somatic marker\" to highlight this relationship-soma
coming from the Greek word for body and marker reflecting the impact
that previous thought experiences have had on our brains.5 Somatic
markers represent canalized thought patterns that guide the direction,
rapidly and unconsciously, of our thought processes. Rather than
functioning as a form of \"high reason,\" somatic markers highlight some
options, rapidly eliminating the negative and favoring the positive.5 2
They operate at a preconscious and unconscious level. 5 3 Somatic
markers \"do not deliberate for us\[;\]\" rather, they function as a
\"biasing device.\"5 4

**[Somatic markers]{.underline}** are [generated when we engage
with]{.underline} a certain [thought **over** and **over**
again]{.underline}. The common [rhetorical strategy of
**[repetition]{.mark}**]{.underline} seems [designed to]{.underline}
help [[**entrench** a thought]{.mark} or conclusion in the
**brain**]{.underline}. Moreover, collective cultural experiences can
produce somatic markers.55 Political scientist William Connolly has
applied Damasio\'s somatic marker thesis and argued that with respect to
culture, the rhetoric we are exposed to in television, film, and
journalism can produce somatic markers that [**[affect]{.mark}** our
thinking and [judgment in]{.mark} an [**unconscious**
way]{.mark}]{.underline}. 56 Through mass culture, somatic markers
become carved out in our brains as early as childhood, be coming
\"filtered into \[our\] mode of being\" before we even develop language
skills.57

Further, rhetoric\'s emotional aspects tend to deemphasize our critical
thinking faculties. When we are presented with a stimulus that promotes
emotion, it becomes difficult to think with our higher order faculties.
Instead, our circuits become focused on the threatening situation and
the flight or fight response.s Emotional rhetoric releases chemical
reactions in our brain that subdue and dampen the part of our brain (the
prefrontal cortex) that controls higher order thinking. 59 The end
result is a state of mindlessness, which is analogous to a drug-induced
state. 60 Emotional rhetoric is also more memorable and powerful than
non-emotional rhetoric, because emotional rhetoric activates more
systems in the brain, the arousal is greater, and larger neural networks
become forged.61 In other words, we engage more deeply with emotional
rhetoric and it feels great.

Rhetoric-induced mindlessness often happens in a collective ritualistic
setting, such as when we attend a rally for our preferred political
candidate or a sports game for our favorite professional or college
team.6 2 In this situation, our brain dampens our critical thinking and
ratchets up its emotional side.63 These situations

> all involve a sublimation of individuality caused by the dampening of
> general neuronal communication, coupled with the intensification of
> the activity of a few specific neural networks. The flood of
> neurotransmitters that produces pleasure puts brain cells on alert,
> making them more receptive to signals from other neurons.
> Consequently, our receptivity to sensual interactions with the
> environment and other people is increased, but our cognitive capacity
> is reduced.\'

In this way, rhetoric fosters communal bonds by fueling intragroup
intimacy in a pleasurable way.65

A study from Emory neuroscientist Drew Westen further supports the
rhetoric/drug analogy. In this brain imaging study, subjects viewed a
favored political candidate making a clearly inconsistent statement.
During this scenario, areas of the subjects\' brains related to
unpleasant distress lit up.66 The subjects then attempted to
rehabilitate their candidate by applying faulty and illogical reasoning
to rationalize the inconsistency; their brains were looking for \"ways
to turn off \[this\] spigot of unpleasant emotion.\"67 When the subjects
engaged in this flawed reasoning, the brain scans indicated that the
subjects were able to turn off the neural areas associated with
unpleasantness and instead trigger areas of pleasure.6 8 The faulty and
illogical reasoning triggered a state of pleasure in the brain,
\"activating reward circuits that \[gave\] partisans a jolt of positive
reinforcement for their biased reasoning.\"69 The illogical reasoning
provided a neural \"fix\" similar to what drug addicts experience.70

Viewed through the lens of neuroscience, [rhetoric]{.underline} is like
a drug-it [functions **beyond** consciousness]{.underline}, heightens
emotional reactions, and can produce a state of mindlessness. The Greek
Sophist Gorgias believed that \"[[**persuasive** discourse]{.mark} has
**effects** on the human **soul** that]{.underline}, like drugs or
physical force, **[[overwhelm]{.underline}]{.mark}** and cancel out [the
possibility of [**individual** agency]{.mark}]{.underline}.7 1 Thus, the
Greeks categorized the rhetorician in the same class as a medical doctor
or mystic. 72 Ancient Greek sages feared the embodied power of rhetoric,
and, as a precursor to Descartes, exhorted individuals to try to
separate the mind from the body, so as to not succumb to rhetoric\'s
powerful spell.73 Here, the ancient idea that rhetoric intrudes into and
interacts with the body aligns with modern neuroscientific and cognitive
theories that support an embodied approach to rhetoric.

This [[dynamic of **demobilization** and retreat is not
**accidental**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[but flows from]{.mark} the
[capitalist]{.mark} state's]{.underline} institutionalization of
capital's [[**dominance** over labor]{.underline}]{.mark}. The price of
admission to a place within the institutions of the capitalist state for
the responsible [[representatives of **working class**]{.mark} and
oppressed people [is **accepting** the rules of the game of]{.mark} the
[existing **political institutions**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even while
there are important ways these representatives can amplify working-class
struggles, the rules of the game also [involve a [willingness to
**abide** by the law]{.mark}]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} usually
[[restricts]{.mark} the ability of working people to organize
**disruptive [struggles]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

This can be seen very clearly even in a nonrevolutionary period---the
United States during the Second World War, when the [US [labor
movement]{.mark} was offered a place at the table in the **capitalist
state apparatus**]{.underline}.23 Both the AFL and CIO were [[given
**representation**]{.mark} on]{.underline} a variety of [wartime
boards]{.underline} charged with everything from the allocation of labor
to various war industries (Office of Production Management) to the
regulation of wages, hours, and working conditions (War Labor Board).
The [[ticket]{.mark} to this dance [was **renouncing**]{.mark} the
workers' most powerful weapon]{.underline}---[[the **right to
strike**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The labor officialdom hoped that their
[[participation in **state**]{.mark} **administration**]{.underline} of
the war economy would initiate a process of the social-democratization
of the US economy, where unions would have a permanent role in
administering the economy and the state would protect workers through
universal social programs. Instead, [labor's **wartime** participation
in these state agencies **[hot-housed]{.mark}** the [bureaucratization
of]{.mark} the new industrial **[unions]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as a
system of industrial jurisprudence based on the [grievance procedure
**displaced** strike]{.underline} action [over workplace
issues]{.underline}.

As shop-floor activism, the cellular basis of workers' power, was
stifled, the labor movement as a whole was weakened. Rather than labor
winning a public role in production, [**capital** regained untrammeled
private **investment**]{.underline} and control of the labor process and
substantially [[weakened]{.mark} the **[legal rights]{.mark}** of

single-payer health care, social security pensions that could provide
all retirees with an adequate income and a massive program of public
housing, US labor was reduced to negotiating private welfare states

profitability of the employers, and accepting a racially segregated
program of federally sponsored individual home ownership. When the
postwar boom came to an end in the late 1960s, this labor movement

the [global]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[machine]{.underline}**]{.mark},
I'll call, following Warren Neidich, the 'Statisticon'.

The technique of customization that enables Google and other search
engines to anticipate our requests, as well as to shape and control our
desires, is called the 'filter bubble'. The filter bubble is an example
of what Warren Neidich calls the Statisticon: a reducer of future events
into probability and predictability. Pre-emption is complementary to the
statistical capture; preemptying the future means preventing future
behaviour and emptying it of singularity.

In the dynamics of the Statisticon, the mirror acts as a generator that
leads the machine to anticipate and pre-package social behaviour.

The Statisticon evolves together with the environment (in this case,
social life), but the condition for this coevolution is the
[pre-inscribed structural **homology** that makes social **interaction**

governance]{.underline}.

The [[agent of **enunciation**]{.mark} must [use]{.mark} the

be]{.underline} effective [communication]{.underline}. Once the agent of
enunciation has accepted the format that makes interaction possible, the
interaction can evolve, and the machine can adapt to the living organism
insofar as the living organism has also adapted to the machine.

The statistical pre-emption implies two complementary actions: one is
the recording of massive flows of data; the second is the adapting of
the machine to the living environment and the reciprocal adaptation of
the living, conscious organisms to the machine.

Large amounts of data give the machine its ability to adapt, while
simultaneously [the filter **bubble** [induces the]{.mark}
living]{.underline}, [[conscious organisms to **comply**

**machine**]{.underline}.

[Statistical **pre-emption** is]{.underline} the mode of functioning of
governance, the contemporary form of political and economic power -- [a
form of engendered **[determinism]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Pre-emption acts as a deterministic trap: the future of the organism can
be altered through bio-technical or techno-social modifications. The
possible is captured and reduced to mere probability, and the probable
is enforced as necessary.

Nevertheless at the next bifurcation a new possibility surfaces, and the
next bifurcation will be the following: a process of cognitive
automation underway in our time. Will the general intellect (millions of
cognitarians worldwide) find a body -- an erotic, aesthetic and ethical
body?

Futures are inscribed in the present as immanent possibilities, not as
necessary developments of a code. Futurability refers to the
multidimensionality of the future: in the present a plurality of futures
is inscribed. Consciousness is one of the deciding factors in the
selection between these possibilities, and consciousness is continuously
changing in the flow of changing social composition.

A process of cognitive automation is underway in our time. Articulations
of the global machine (interfaces, applications ...) proliferate and
insert themselves in the social mind. The conjunctive body and the
conjunctive mind are penetrated by the architecture of overall
connectivity.

A code is inscribed in the info-neural connection; [[as we face]{.mark}
this]{.underline} process of [[**cognitive wiring** we
are]{.underline}]{.mark} often [[led to think]{.mark} that [there is no
way **out** from]{.mark}]{.underline} a sort of
**[[neurototalitarianism]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the making.

A way out from neuro-totalitarianism does exist as the conjunctive body
of the general intellect is wider that the code embedded in it, and the
dynamics of the general intellect may lead to unexpected deviations from
the determinist replication of the coded actuation.

The present [[depression]{.underline}]{.mark} ([[both **psychological**
and **economic**]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[obscures]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [consciousness [that no]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**determinist**
projection]{.mark} of the future [is true]{.mark}]{.underline}. [We feel
[trapped in]{.mark}]{.underline} the tangle of
**[[techno-linguistic]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[automatisms]{.underline}]{.mark}: finance, [global
[competition]{.mark}]{.underline}, [military
**[escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But the body of the general
intellect (the social and erotic bodies of a million cognitarians) is
richer than the connective brain. And the present reality is richer than
the format imposed on it, as the multifold possibilities inscribed in
the present have not been wholly cancelled, even if they may seem
presently inert.

The possible is immanent, but it's unable to develop into a process of
actualization.

[The [inertia of]{.mark} the **[possibilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}
inscribed in the present composition of the social body [[is an effect
of]{.mark} the]{.underline} [**[impotence]{.mark}** [of
**subjectivity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. During the last century, the
social subjectivity of workers experienced forms of solidarity, autonomy
and welfare -- then at the end of the century it became disempowered so
that it is now unable to express those potentialities which are present
in the general intellect and in the body of social solidarity.

**Casey '20** \[John; April 1; Professor of Philosophy @ Northeastern
Illinois University; Erudit; Informal Logic, "Adversariality and
Argumentation," vol. 40, no. 1\]

One strain is that argument is aggressive, mean, and generally
unpleasant on account of our tendency to describe it that way (Lakoff &
Johnson 1980). Thus, arguers defend positions, attack claims with
devastating objections, and other similarly belligerent metaphors. This
conceptual machinery then occasions bellicose, or, more generally,
[**[adversarial behavior]{.mark}** among arguers]{.underline}. This
[[includes]{.underline}]{.mark} competitive manoeuvring such as
[[adopting standpoints for **strategic**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[not
**epistemic reasons**]{.underline}]{.mark}, or a preference for nitpicky
criticisms that facilitate point-scoring, or the intentional committing
of fallacies. Ironically, there is a sports analogy that illustrates
this point. Sport is a rule-governed activity founded on the concept of
competition in the spirit of fair play. To describe sport in bellicose
terms is, on this analogy, to [[encourage]{.mark} the [**erosion**
of]{.mark} norms of [**fairness** and **competition**]{.mark} such as
strategic rule-breaking or dirty play]{.underline} (Aikin 2011). Central
to this thesis is the idea that the metaphors are optional (Lakoff &
Johnson 1980: p. 9). Given this, the solution to this problem of
adversariality readily suggests itself: use other metaphors. Why not
cross pollination or barn-raising (Cohen 1995)? We might even view
arguers as lovers (Brockreide 1972).

A second approach to the problem admits that adversariality is an
inherent feature of some, but not all, kinds of argument. Walton and
Krabbe, for instance, argue that argument is dialogue and dialogues are
understood according to their different purposes. Among these purposes
are inquiry, persuasion, negotiation, deliberation, information seeking,
and, importantly, eristic or quarrel- ling (Walton & Krabbe 1995 p. 66).
Crucially, only some of the forms of argument dialogue---persuasion
dialogue and eristic---are essentially adversarial (and only eristic or
quarrelling truly exemplify the negative sense of adversariality).
Adversarialism be- comes a problem when, for some reason---perhaps
sexism, covenience, legalism, or cultural chauvinism---adversarial kinds
of argument are overrepresented and so crowd out more collaborative
forms of argumentation. The result is that [people **mistakenly** think
of argument]{.underline} in general [as]{.underline} a fundamentally and
**[entirely adversarial]{.underline}** undertaking. This is what Janice
Moulton means by the "adversary paradigm," where the
argument-as-refutation style of the stereo- typical philosophy seminar
is the dominant method (Moulton 1983).

A third way to conceive of adversariality in argument is not as a
description or a choice, as with the first two, but as an essential
feature of the interaction. Govier (1999) maintains that a certain
element of adversarialism is essential to and therefore ineliminable
from argument. She discovers this in an analysis of the fundamental
components of arguments, i.e. in beliefs or commitments rather than the
procedural features of sharing reasons. Having a commitment to p, for
Govier, puts one in a kind of adversarial opposition, even if only
logical or dialectical, to those who do not hold that p. This essential
adversariality, however, need not be any more than the bare logical
entailment that if p then not-p is false. Anything more, she argues, is
"ancillary adversariality," by which she means all of the aggressive
nastiness of disagreement. [While [those who hold **p**
and]{.mark}]{.underline} those who hold [[**not-p** may be in]{.mark}
dialectical **[opposition]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [it [does not follow
that they need to be in]{.mark} **emotional**]{.underline},
[rhetorical]{.underline}, [or [**psychological**
opposition]{.mark}]{.underline}.

\<\<CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

Govier's view has been challenged by Rooney (2010) and Hundleby (2013).
They separately argue that Govier's account of minimal adversariality is
(1) epistemically mistaken and (2) prone to a kind of dialectical
slippage into ancillary adversariality. It is epistemically mistaken
because arguments do not have winners, losers, or opponents. It is prone
to a kind of slippage towards adversariality because viewing argument
like a contest will likely make it so, as Lakoff and Johnson argue.
There already exists a terminology suitable to the task of describing
adversarial views without the adversarial language. Importantly, while
Rooney and Hundleby clearly disagree with Govier about the nature of
adversariality and argument, they follow her in the view that it is a
fundamental question about the nature of argument rather than a question
of descriptions of argument interactions or choices of argument forms.
In this paper, I will argue for a variation of Govier's view and
maintain that argument is adversarial, not only in some unfortnate
misdescriptions, or in some of its particular and possibly unhappy
manifestations, but in itself. That is just what it is. Argument is
adversarial to the extent that one arguer attempts to exercise control
over the beliefs of another arguer. The criticisms of Govier's position,
I shall argue, are enlightening in that they reveal a basic ambiguity
about arguments that is endemic to argumentation literature, that is,
are arguments relations of propositional commitments, or alternatively,
are they relations of beliefs? The difference is a critical one because,
plausibly, you have direct, voluntary control over your commitments but
not your beliefs. More significantly, beliefs have significant costs
associated with their formation, preservation, revision, and extinction.
Furthermore, beliefs can be significant parts of one's identity, and so
altering them, even through rational argument, constitutes a significant
intrusion on the autonomy of another person. The paper unfolds as
follows. Since claiming that argument is adversarial naturally involves
claims about both argumentation and adversariality, I begin in §2 by
rehearsing some classic and hopefully uncontroversial distinctions
between argument as a process and argument as a product. I then turn to
what is likely going to be a more controversial discussion of the
relation of the concept of argument to disagreement, because, after all,
disagree- ment seems to many people to have something to do with adver-
sariality. I argue here that it is important to distinguish the two
concepts because argument is just as much about agreement as it is about
disagreement. I turn then to a discussion of the nature of
adversariality where I distinguish between adversariality of inter- est
(where participants engage over something that cannot be shared, such as
material goods) and adversariality of process (where the relation
between participants is determined by involun- tariness). Critically,
adversarial processes can apply to circum- stances where there is no
material or otherwise unshareable object. Having defined argument and
adversariality, in §3 I review Go- vier's concept of minimal
adversariality along with Hundleby's and Rooney's criticisms of it. In
§4 I argue for a modified version of Govier's thesis where arguments are
essentially adversarial because beliefs are involuntary. That argument
is adversarial seems more urgently to be the case when we consider that
aside from their involuntariness, beliefs are costly to us in their for-
mation, maintenance, and extinction. §5 concludes with a brief
discussion of the implications of my view of adversariality for the
problem of adversariality in argument. 2. Argument, disagreement, and
adversariality It is standard in argumentation theory to distinguish
between argument as a product (or argument1) and argument as process (or
argument2)(O'Keefe 1977; Brockriede 1977). As a product, an argument is
an utterance, a communicative act, a set of sentences or propositions, a
premise-conclusion complex, or an illative core (Johnson 2000, p. 150).
This sense of argument has little obvious relevance to the concerns of
adversariality, which, minimally, will involve more than one arguer.3 We
see this in the conception of argument as process. As a process, an
argument is an "interaction or transaction" (Brockriede 1977, p. 129).
It is "something two or more persons have (or engage in)" (O'Keefe 1977,
p.121). An argument, in this sense, is the exchange of argument products
between two (or more) people or even between a person and them- selves
(O'Keefe 1977, p. 121). Put another way, an argument as a product is an
argument (a noun), and as a process it is arguing (a verb). The process
sense of argument is secondary, in a way, to the product sense.

\<\<PARAGRAPH INTEGRITY RESUMES\>\>

A common view among process-oriented approaches is that argumentation is
fundamentally about disagreement. According to Sally Jackson and Scott
Jacobs (1980), "arguments are disagreement relevant speech events" (p.
254). Rhetorical theorist Michael Gilbert (1996) has an even more
expansive sense of the place of disagreement in argumentation: "an
argument is any disagreement---from the most polite discussion to the
loudest brawl" (p. 5). Along these same lines, Charles Willard (1989)
writes "argument is a form of interaction in which two or more people
maintain what they construe to be incompatible positions" (p. 1). The
idea that argument begins in disagreement is also robustly present in
pragma-dialectics. This is evident not only in its definition of
argument as "a verbal, social, and rational activity aimed at convincing
a reasonable critic of the acceptability of a standpoint" (van Eemeren &
Grootendorst 2004, p. 1), but also in its description of the process of
argumentation. This process begins in a confrontation stage where the
difference of opinion is made explicit (p. 60).

\<\<CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

Historically, informal logicians have tended to focus on
product-oriented conceptions of argument. Nevertheless, they do not
neglect to identify arguments in their broader dialectical context,
which is, unsurprisingly, disagreement or controversy. Trudy Govier
writes, An argument is a reasoned attempt to justify a claim on the
basis of other claims. . . . When we use arguments in the sense of
offering reasons for our beliefs, we are responding to controversies by
attempting rational persuasion. (2010, p.2) As we shall see in more
detail presently, Govier derives the inherent adversariality of argument
from the controversies they are meant to address rather than the method
of addressing them. It is certainly not true that every argumentation
theorist founds argument in disagreement. Walton (1998) and Moulton
(1983), as we have discussed, view disagreement resolution as one among
many argument functions. Goodwin (2007), in contrast, denies that
argument has any specific function. Exceptions aside, disagreement
certainly looms large in argumentation theory, and it seems natural to
assume that people who disagree are adversaries precisely on account of
the disagreement. But this assumption masks considerable complexity to
the relation between disagreement and adversariality and between
adversariality and aggressiveness. As we have seen already, for some
theorists, adversariality does not regard the content of an interaction
but rather the manner of inter- acting. So, what is worrisome about
adversariality is the aggressiveness of argumentative encounters. Thus
Moulton, and others, worry that arguers will treat each other like
adversaries when there are other, non-adversarial means of interacting.
Others maintain that adversariality abides, in our (mistaken) conception
of arguments, as zero-sum affairs with prizes for winning. Their worry
is that we act these conceptions out when they are not appropriate.
Still others, like Govier (1999), define adversariality in reference to
the content of a disagreement, where people are adversaries because they
believe different things or espouse different commitments. It is clear,
then, that what argument theorists mean by "adversary" or "adversarial"
varies significantly. A more problematic assumption is that disagreement
is a necessary condition of adversariality when it might turn out that
agreement is also in some sense adversarial. An adversary might after
all be a friend who works contrary to your interests.5 They agree with
you and you with them, but the agreement is bad. Even worse, this
"friend" might, on account of the friendship, use collaborative or
(allegedly) non-adversarial kinds of consensus-building arguments to
further their adversarial ends. This kind of case, at minimum, suggests
that it is time to revisit what it means to be adversarial in a
fundamental sense. This is what I turn to now. Where to begin? A common
approach to the topic of adversariality in argument is Govier's. She
writes: It means that in this practice people occupy roles that set them
against one another, as adversaries or opponents. Law, in Western
societies is adversarial in the sense that the prosecution and the
defense play distinct and opposed roles. Politics is adversarial: it is
the role of the governing party to govern and the opposition to
criticize the government. Debates are also organized adversarially: one
side proposing a claim, the other side opposing it. In these in-
stitutions, roles have been organized in a bipolar fashion and the
people occupying them are, for institutional reasons, set against each
other (p. 242). But this approach is problematic. First, law, politics,
and debate are fundamentally argumentative practices, so they cannot
explain the adversariality of argument. If anything, they get their
adversariality from the fact that they are argumentative practices.
Second, they are rule-bound (at least in the case of law and debate)
forms of argumentation, so they can, at best, only tell us about some
arguments or some forms of arguments. Sadly, many arguments in common
life do not seem to obey the rules, though they are nonetheless
arguments. Finally, as rule-bound practices, politics, debate, and law
are artificial, while the claim on the table is that argument is
essentially adversarial. By "essentially," in this case, Govier clearly
means something like "naturally" or "ineliminably," "inherently," "in
virtue of its nature," or some other such phrase. This is not, of
course, to say that politics, debate, or law do not offer us insights
into the nature of argument's adversariality. It is merely to hold that
they do not define it. What, then, is adversariality? For what it is
worth, the etymology of the term, the Latin adversarius, refers broadly
to any kind of antagonist in a contest, election, game, discussion and
so on. This is not much help, but it at least suggests that
adversariality minimally requires, as a definitional matter,
participants who are the adversaries. This means that adversariality is
a relational state, and relational states require relata, in this case
(mostly) people stand- ing in a relation of some kind. This is borne out
by common examples. Any kind of physical fight is adversarial, and that
certainly requires two people or animals; lawsuits require defendants,
hockey requires two teams, and chess requires two players though
nowadays one of those players can be artificial (perhaps in some
dystopian future the same will be true of hockey as well). A rock
climber, or a mathematician, may even speak (metaphorically) of an
inanimate object or a concept as an adversary. Sometimes people speak of
themselves as their own adversaries. Nevertheless, to say that an
adversarial situation requires two adversaries is not to say very much.
The tango, after all, requires two participants, but it is not
adversarial. What is it then that makes an interaction adversarial? That
we are talking about a relational interaction gives rise to a
fundamental ambiguity about the nature of adversariality. For, on the
one hand, we might consider adversariality with respect to the object of
some interaction such that one wins and the other loses. Let's call this
adversariality of interest. In another sense, we might consider
adversariality as definitive of the nature of the interaction between
two people such that they are adversaries if they behave a certain way
in an interaction. Let's call this adversarial interac- tion. Let's
first look at adversariality of interest. Adversariality of interest
regards something two people, in a simple case, both want but cannot
both entirely possess. To use the language of economics, they contend
over a "rivalrous good" which is "excludable." A rivalrous good is one
that is to some extent scarce such that one person's having it means
another nec- essarily has less (or none) of it. These adversarial goods
are ex- cludable because the possession of it by one precludes the other
from having it. On this description, that adversariality only regards
alienable objects or rather interests with respect to alienable ob-
jects. We can put this a bit more formally and define adversariality of
interest by reference to opposed or inconsistent interests. I want p and
you want p but we both can't have p. Our interests with respect to p are
therefore opposed in the sense that they are incon- sistently
satisfiable. So, A and B are adversarial with respect to p only if p is
something both A and B want to have, try to have, but both cannot have.
This picture is naturally simplified. Perhaps it is the case that A and
B can have some, but not all of p. A's interest (which is a vague notion
on purpose; it could include desire, etc.) is to have all of p. Or, at
the very least, A wants what A wants. The adversarial situation arises
because of B, because B exists, wants p, and tries to get it. They can
split it, but this is less than what A wanted. There is no
adversariality of interest without the incon- sistency feature. The main
characteristics of adversariality of interest situations is the
end-state division of the spoils. You might even say, since the
objective is definitive, this is the only charac- teristic. So, winning
and losing are appropriately applied to these cases. By way of example,
two motorists can be adversaries with regard to the one remaining
parking spot---it will go to whoever gets there first (or however it is
decided). But we can characterize other adversarial situations by
reference to rivalrous goods. People who play a game are adversarial
with respect to the acquisition of points or the achieving of a goal
because victory in a game is often determined by the scarcity of some
kind of goal or end state; only the winner can have it. In addition to
parking spots and sports, this sense of adversariality captures some
aspects of the adversarial nature of many other things: law, where
parties contend over some material good or state action (guilt or
innocence); business, where parties compete for market share; or
finally, war, where only one side can win (though many say both actually
lose). It often seems that many concerns over adversariality in argu-
ment regard the adversariality of interests. Thus, Cohen (1995), among
others (Johnson 2000 and Rooney 2010) wonders what sense it makes to
"win" an argument when only the loser, if any- one, actually makes any
sort of gain (by having their views im- proved). As Johnson notes, the
language of winner, loser, or oppo- nent, and so on, is wholly foreign
to the primary epistemic aim of argumentation, truth or justified
belief, which arguers presumably share as a common objective. Bailin and
Battersby (2017) put the matter poignantly: Argumentation involves the
confrontation of ideas with the goal of reaching the best justified
position but this need not and indeed should not be viewed in terms of a
conflict between individuals. Arguers may come to an argument with
various initial intentions including, but not limited to, wanting to
persuade their interlocu- tor of a different view. But so long as they
are open to seriously considering alternative arguments, and willing to
follow the rea- soning where it leads and to alter their own position
accordingly, they are involved in a joint endeavour and are not
opponents (p. 4). Since true beliefs are non-rivalrous and
non-excludable, that one person has a true belief does not deny others
the possibility of also having that true belief. If this were the only
kind of adversariality to worry about, it would hardly pose a very
vexing problem. It is of course true that people often weaponize
argument performances for other purposes, such as increasing social
status, political ad- vantage, or bragging rights. But these do not
speak to the inherent adversariality of argument any more than a baking
competition represents the inherent adversariality of eating cookies.
The con- cern over adversariality, of course, remains because there is
anoth- er way to understand adversarial interactions. To see what is
distinctive about adversarial interactions, as interactions, let us
contrast them with cooperative or coordinated interactions. The tango,
or any kind of dance, is a kind of coopera- tive interaction involving
two dancers. The same could be said of musical duets, gardening,
construction, and other similar endeav ours where two people might
participate. In these activities, the participants agree to play
complementary roles (such as lead and follow in the case of dance, or
violin or banjo in the case of a duet). As a consequence of their
complementary roles, each partic- ipant contributes to the construction
of a common objective or product (a dance, a piece of music, and so
forth). In contrast, if two people, A and B, interact as adversaries,
then the action of A on B and B on A, for the purpose and duration of
the adversarial exchange, is characterized by involuntariness; A will
try either to impose a result on B or frustrate B's attempt to do the
same to A. This means that an adversary is both one who frustrates your
action and one who compels you do to something.6 What might be a base
case of this kind of adversarial interac- tion? Brute physical
interaction, where A forcefully compels or frustrates B, would seem to
qualify. A's force overcomes B's will, so the interaction is
involuntary. For this reason, it seems sensible to say that
involuntariness is a basic condition of an adversarial interaction. It
is certainly the case that adversarial interaction can obtain in the
absence of some kind of contestable object. Fights are certainly
adversarial even if there is no point in their taking place. The same is
true of other applications of physical force, such as shoving someone,
or restraining someone (say, in hand- cuffs). These possibilities
clearly distinguish, then, cases of adver- sarial interaction from cases
of adversariality of interest. There is not some rivalrous good to be
contested, but rather one's own control over one's own body and action.
In this sense, criminal law is adversarial because it operates on force
alone without respect to a good. Other cases of adversarial interaction
are less pure, as it were, because the involuntariness regards a
contestable good. In the parking example mentioned earlier, the
occupation of a certain parking spot with your car frustrates someone's
desire to park there and, presuming they don't have a tank, compels them
to park elsewhere. Nonetheless, the interaction, involving your car, or
perhaps the law or other rules in case there is some other prohibi-
tion, is independently adversarial. We can also see this in games. In
chess, this occurs by movement of pieces and the occupation of spaces on
the board; in hockey, this is achieved sometimes by moving the puck,
sometimes by actual physical contact, such as checking. The
adversariality of games and certain other interactions, as we have noted
above, raise interesting questions. In the first place, they are
artificial. The object of an adversarial game depends on what people
desire it to be. In the game of chess, the object is to seize the
opponent's king or force them to concede. In hockey and other similarly
structured sports, the object is to have more points than the other
team. Second, in addition to defining the object of the adversarial
interaction, games also define the nature of the interaction---what
sorts of contact is allowable, what is not. In this sense, the
adversariality of games is derivative and regulated. Chess, for example,
regulates what counts as a legal move. Hock- ey does the same, and it
penalizes (with time in the penalty box) prohibited interactions (though
to a novice spectator it seems like anything goes). To return to a point
we made earlier, these obser- vations apply just as well to debate
competitions and the law; they define an objective and set regulations
for the kinds of things that can be said. Fundamentally, however, within
the scope of the game, the adversarial interaction is characterized by
involuntari- ness because the participants are each trying to control
the other's play. At this point one might object that to call parking
and other similar activities adversarial too greatly expands what counts
as adversarial. And this definition seems to run the risk of diluting
the concept and rendering it useless. Indeed, there is only so much
space for you (or your car) and your occupying that space means someone
else cannot. It is hardly helpful to consider the worlds highways and
pavements ground zero of an infinity of adversarial relations. In reply,
however, there is no reason that that they can- not become adversarial
in a basic structural sense. Besides, the fact that these interactions
can become adversarial underscores the distinction between
adversariality of interest and adversariality of interaction:
interactions can become adversarial, marked by frus tration and
compulsion, in the absence of any kind of structured interest. The
happenstance nature of these kinds of adversarial circum- stances
suggests a further distinction. It seems that some adversar- ial
interactions are essentially so. Chess, hockey, and many (but not all)
kinds of sport require, as a necessary condition of playing them,
compelling or frustrating the other player.7 But some kinds of
activities that we consider to be adversarial become so only because the
participants resolve to treat each other as adversaries. This is what
makes running, cycling, or other kinds of individual sports adversarial.
Beyond sport, we can apply the same analysis to essay-writing contests,
music competitions, competitive chicken breeding, or, for some people,
driving or walking on the sidewalk. This distinction also illustrates
the independence of adversariality of interaction from adversariality of
interest. Inessential adversari- al interactions can, in other words,
lack adversarial interaction. So far, we've distinguished between two
independent perspec- tives on adversariality: adversariality with regard
to interests and adversariality with regard to interaction. The former
perspective focuses on the rivalrous goods over which people contest;
the latter concerns the manner of interaction, such that one participant
tries to impose a result on another or frustrate them from achieving
their objectives. Though the perspectives may overlap in certain
scenarios, they are distinct and independent of each other. We made a
further distinction between natural and artificial adversari- al
situations. Artificial adversarial situations are regulated and have
objectives that are set by designation and interactions defined by
rules, like chess, or debate. Some artificial adversarial interac- tions
are essential, in that, for the duration of the interaction (e.g.,
within the scope of a game) the interactions can be nothing but
adversarial. Others are not essential, because the adversaries do not
necessarily interact with each other in order to play the interac- tion.
The purpose of this rather long discussion of adversariality is to
determine whether and in what sense argument is adversarial. The
question for the next sections will be, then, whether argument is an
essentially and naturally adversarial interaction. Given this rough
picture of adversariality, a natural question is whether adversariality
and aggressiveness are the same thing. Much of the controversy about
adversarial argument hinges on this question. One view is that they are
indeed the same as to be adver- sarial involves the desire to impede or
compel someone else. To be adversarial simply means to be aggressive.
Consider Dominic Infante's description of aggressiveness: An
interpersonal behavior may be considered aggressive if it ap- plies
force physically or symbolically in order, minimally, to dom- inate and
perhaps damage or, maximally, to defeat and perhaps destroy the locus of
attack. The locus of attack in interpersonal communication can be a
person's body, material possessions, self- concept, position on topics
of communication, or behavior (1987 p. 158). Interestingly, on Infante's
view, argument is a form of aggressive communication. It is natural, I
think, to conclude that adversariali- ty and aggressiveness strongly
overlap. But this is not the only or even the most obvious view. An
alternative view is that aggres- siveness and adversariality merely
overlap but are not the same. Aggressiveness, on this view, might
consist in intention to do someone harm, where harm extends to the
person beyond the person's role in a contest (Bäck, 2004, p. 221).
Clearly, aggression and adversariality overlap and sorting out their
differences is not easy. Ordinary usage is not much of a guide as the
terms are often used interchangeably (this is also true of the
literature in argumentation). Perhaps we might start by conceding that
aggressiveness and adversariality overlap to the extent that aggressive
acts will include the attempt to frustrate or compel. To put it bluntly,
all aggressive encounters are adversarial encounters. Is it the case,
however, that all adversarial encounters are aggres- sive? This is the
critical question. I think there a few good reasons to think they are
not the same. The first reason is, at least as I have defined it,
adversariality can be understood structurally. Certain kinds of
encounters, I have argued, are necessarily adversarial whether or not
the participants want them to be so. Hockey and chess are adversarial so
long as the rules are followed. This remains the case no matter how
badly one side loses or fails to put in a serious effort. To put this
another way, they are not more or less adversarial. They are adversarial
or not. We can extend this to what I have called the "inessential"
cases. Driving along the road is not adversarial until space be- comes
limited and people try to outdo each other. There is not a period of low
or medium adversariality. It is the case or it is not. Adversariality
is, in other words, a state and not a process. By contrast,
aggressiveness seems to admit of degree. One can play a game of chess
more or less aggressively (by, say, going on the attack rather than
playing defence). One can be more or less ag- gressive in the
inessential cases as well---elbowing one's way through a crowd or
cutting off drivers on the road. The second reason is that
aggressiveness seems to be optional. It is obvious to everyone, I hope,
that some of our adversarial encounters have worrisome features. It is
typically the case that these are associated with aggressiveness.
Driving in traffic is one thing, but doing so amidst angry honking,
obscene gestures, and dangerous maneuvers is another thing. Those latter
things make the experience unpleasant and dangerous. More significantly,
they seem, however predictable, to be optional. Traffic exists without
honking. A hockey game still occurs without fighting or slashing. We can
do without them. Finally, closely related to this reason is that
aggression is the territory of useful normative notions about our
adversarial interac- tions. Too much aggressiveness is indeed a bad
thing. Rule sys- tems in games are constructed to contain
aggressiveness. A helpful example of this is American football. American
football is, on any account, a violent sport. It nonetheless contains a
robust (but still perhaps inadequate) set of rules meant to curb the
worst of the violence. "Targeting," which is leading into a tackle with
one's helmet to hurt another player, is prohibited as overly aggressive
because it is dangerous. It is an extreme version of the allowable
action called "tackling." Separating aggressiveness from adversar-
iality, in this instance, allows the game to continue. Indeed, we might
say that when aggressiveness undermines the purpose of the adversarial
encounter, it ought to be prohibited. Defending that claim is of course
well beyond the scope of this paper. It is none theless clear from this,
I hope, that adversariality and aggressive- ness occupy different
normative terrain. I should add, in closing this section, that the
existence of a distinction between aggressiveness and adversariality
does not of course mean that it is an easy one to spot in all or even
most cases. The substance of debates about what is allowable seems to
rest, in fact, on this troublesome distinction. 3. Minimal essential
adversariality Armed with our discussion of adversariality, let's now
turn to the question as to whether argumentation is essentially
adversarial in the sense I have just described. To review, an
adversarial interac- tion is one involving two participants each of whom
tries to im- pede or compel the other. In what follows, I will apply
this notion of essential adversariality to Govier's concept of minimal
adver- sariality. Govier's notion of minimal adversariality rests on a
distinction between adversariality and aggression (or what Govier calls
"an- cillary adversariality"). This last she defines as the "lack of re-
spect, rudeness, lack of empathy, name-calling, animosity, hostili- ty,
failure to listen and attend carefully, misinterpretation, ineffi-
ciency, dogmatism, intolerance, irritability, quarrelsomeness, and so
forth" (p. 245). To say that argument is essentially adversarial is
clearly to distinguish it from practices which are inessentially
adversarial (such as the running race discussed above). This dis-
tinction accords with Govier's argument for minimal adversariali- ty,
which she puts schematically as follows: 1. I hold X. 2. I think that X
is correct. (Follows from (1)). 3. I think that not-X is not correct.
(Follows from (2)). 4. I think that those who hold not-X are wrong, or
are making a mistake. (Follows from (3)). 5. Should I need to argue for
X, I will thereby be arguing against not-X. (?) 6. Those who hold not-X
are, with regard to the correctness of X and my argument for X, my
opponents (?) (p. 244). For Govier, the adversariality of argument is
reducible to the elements of argumentation (beliefs, opinions, or
standpoints), rather than argumentation itself. This means that
believing is inherently adversarial. If A and B believe differently,
then A and B are already opposed because they hold different beliefs
before or without even arguing with each other. She writes, "in holding
a belief, one thinks it true and is thereby committed to thinking that
those who disagree with it hold a false belief and are in this sense
wrong. One necessarily differs from such people" (p. 244). Phyllis
Rooney (2010) raises two objections to Govier's claim: (1) Govier
misdescribes the epistemic situation; and (2) the dis- tinction between
minimal and ancillary adversariality does not hold. The first objection
is a general claim about the purpose of argument. From an epistemic
point of view, arguments are about truth. The adversarial conception of
argument is foreign to this. Besides, logic and epistemology have a much
richer vocabulary to describe epistemic situations than just "opponent"
or "adversary" (p. 222). To put the matter somewhat differently: the
holding of different views doesn't mean the holders of those views are
op- posed. For Rooney, then, you cannot derive the opposition from the
difference in belief. And, importantly, you cannot derive it from the
nature of the argumentation, whose epistemic purpose is entirely
contrary to competitive opposition. The second objection rejects the
inference from being wrong with respect to p to being opposed, from a
person's belief or claim to the person themselves (p. 221). This might
seem puzzling be- cause saying that a person has a belief which is false
seems to be just another way of saying that a person is wrong with
respect to that belief (which the person has). What is at issue in an
argument is the truth or falsity of claims or commitments. If I argue
that p and someone else argues that q, we are not opposed with regard to
the truth of p (or q), which is, as Rooney argues, the very point of
argumentation. To expand the point somewhat, our arguments are ways we
propose arriving at the truth, a goal both arguers, by definition,
share. So, since the point of arguing is truth, arguers are not
opponents but partners. A similar analysis could be made of the language
of "winner" and "loser." To describe the person with a correct view as
the "winner" is to describe something as a con- test which is not a
contest. Terms such as "winner" and "loser" are a sign of an epistemic
confusion about the nature of arguments. Arguments have epistemic
purposes and are defined in relation to them. This brings us to a
crucial ambiguity in this discussion of ad- versariality: namely, what
are arguments about? Are they about commitments (or acceptances) or are
they about beliefs? The dif- ference is foundational. Beliefs are
psychological states of believ- ers; acceptances are commitments that
belong to an abstract com- mitment set. This is a crucial, but
oft-overlooked difference in argumentation studies (Paglieri, 2006;
Godden 2010, 2012b). Moreover, this distinction is central, I think, to
Govier's case for the minimal essential adversariality of argument. This
point comes clear, I think, in considering another objection to Govier's
view, that of Catherine Hundleby (2013). Recall that, for Govier: 1. I
hold X. 2. I think that X is correct. (Follows from (1)) (1999, p.244).
Hundleby argues that there is no obvious inference from (1) to (2),
because "we believe all sorts of things at any given time without
consciously recognizing them as beliefs, never mind evaluating them"
(emphasis mine, 253). This assessment seems obviously true and it makes
a clarifying point about the basic point at issue here. As a
psychological observation of actual believers, it doesn't make sense to
attribute beliefs to them that they do not have or may not have (or at
least do not necessarily have) even if those beliefs are logically
related. Hundleby makes a similar case with regard to the next steps of
Govier's argument for minimal adversariality. Recall, again, that Govier
argues: 2. I think that X is correct. (Follows from (1)). 3. I think
that not-X is not correct. (Follows from (2)) (1999, p.244). Again, it
seems clearly true that all sorts of things are "not-X" and one is
certainly not liable for thinking of all of them. It is not possible to
claim that in thinking X you are also thinking of all of the instances
of not-X. Imagine a typical introduction to logic scenario where
students work with obversion and fail to recognize the logical identity.
This objection also highlights a crucial confusion on Govier's part. Her
talk about beliefs is better understood as talk about commitments. For,
after all, commitments do have the logical properties in question. To be
committed, for example, to the prop- osition that the earth is round is
to be committed to the proposition that the earth has a circumference.
It doesn't mean, however, that thinking of the roundness of the earth
entails thinking about the circumference, or pi, or any of the other
commitments one as- sumes along with the commitment that the earth is
round. Now the question is whether Govier's conception of minimal
adversariality follows from the claim that arguments are about
commitments, which do have the logical properties and entail- ments she
suggests they have. This brings us back to Rooney's claim that minimal
adversariality is an epistemic misdescription. Arguments will concern
the assertion of relations between com- mitments, and, as Rooney notes,
we've already got a vocabulary for those relations; "contradictory" or
"inconsistent" express the difference in commitments far more accurately
than "opposed" or "enemy" do (p. 222). For these reasons, Govier's
derivation of minimal adversariality from the notion of commitment
fails. I should of course stress that Govier does not use the word
commitment, or acceptance, or even suggest that this distinction
concerns her in the least; my claim here is that this makes the most
sense of her argument. For this reason, I would like to offer a somewhat
modified version of minimal adversariality that addresses this issue. 4.
Doxastic involuntarism and minimal adversariality In this section I will
defend Govier's minimal adversarialism by interpreting the minimal
adversariality of argument to arise from beliefs, rather than
commitments. This defence depends on two critical features of
belief-focused argument. The first is that beliefs are involuntary. The
second is that beliefs are expensive to form, maintain, and change. This
means arguments, even those among people who agree, involve one arguer
imposing costs on another. The concept of commitment, as it is
understood in argumenta- tion studies nowadays, has its origin in
Hamblin-style formal dialogues (Hamblin 1970) which was later refined by
Douglas Walton and Erik Krabbe (1995). Hamblin introduced the idea "of a
dialectical system---a rule-governed structure of organized conver-
sation" (Walton and Krabbe 1995, p. 5). The idea is that these rule
governed systems could be used to model various kinds of dialogi- cal
interaction. Such models could then perhaps be formalized, used to
explain fallacies, and so forth. Critically, according to Hamblin, a
commitment is not necessarily a belief and the purpose of postulating a
commitment store is "not psychological" (p. 6). The very notion of
commitment involves action, as in committed to a course of action (p.
14). But it also involves the concept of obligation, as in "obligation
to pursue a course of action." Accord- ing to Walton and Krabbe,
propositional commitment is a special case of action commitment.
Propositional commitment is "(1) a kind of action commitment whose (2)
partial strategies assign dialogical actions that (3) center on one
proposition (or a formula- tion thereof)" (p. 23). So, a propositional
commitment works something like making a promise (e.g., if X asserts
that p, then X must defend p, repeat p, etc.). So, in essence,
commitments are public actions which are subject to rules, and, most
significantly, laws of logic. In contrast, beliefs are typically
understood to be psychological states or dispositions (Cohen 1992). They
differ from commitments in several key ways. First, they are private. I
can have beliefs which I do not share or beliefs I lie about. This is
not true of commitments, which are understood to be public. Second, they
are not necessarily subject to logical laws in their formation, mainte-
nance, and extinction. To believe, in other words, that the Evening Star
is Hesperus does not necessarily entail that one believes the Evening
Star is also Venus. Those are distinct psychological states. A final
critical difference between belief and commitment, as we have mentioned,
is voluntariness. As actions, commitments are voluntarily adopted and
abandoned. Beliefs, in contrast, are not. By way of illustration, try to
believe that 5 + 4 = 11. Now imagine I will offer you a reward of an ice
cream cone if you can. Or, consider an inducement more relevant to the
current topic: I'll refrain from hitting you if you believe that 5 + 4 =
11. You proba- bly cannot do it (although I am going to guess that you
will tell me that you do not believe it). We can run the same experiment
with different kinds of beliefs. Try to believe you are not reading the
words that I have written here, or that you are not where you are, or
that you are made of glass. You cannot. I should caution that the
literature on doxastic voluntarism is quite vast, and, though the
consensus view is that beliefs are in- voluntary with regard to direct
formation, there are obviously indirect things we can do to bring about
beliefs. We can, for in- stance, (1) alter our environment to bring
about beliefs---i.e. inves- tigate, change things, make something
happen, or (2) engage in a process of examining evidence. Naturally, we
cannot control the specific belief we have (which would tend to produce
the opposite result). We can only control what kind of evidence we have.
In- deed, the fact that we have to manage our exposure to evidence
underscores the involuntariness of significant aspects of belief
formation, maintenance, and extinction. To maintain a belief, for
example, I can avoid situations where I know I will have to face
conflicting evidence. The same is true for strengthening a belief, I can
seek out situations where I'll be presented with more evidence for my
belief.

\<\<PARAGRAPH INTEGRITY RESUMES\>\>

Our lack of direct control over our own beliefs has an important
consequence for argumentation: [[others have **more influence** over our
**beliefs**]{.mark} than we do]{.underline}. For many, [this is one of
the [main virtues]{.mark} of]{.underline} this sense of
[argument]{.underline}: [[to **submit yourself** to the **influence** of
others]{.underline}]{.mark}. While we cannot, according to the basic
thesis of indirect doxastic voluntarism, direct ourselves to a specific
belief, others, so it would seem, are in a position to do so. This kind
of directing is what arguments are all about even at the most rational
level. [I expose you to [**evidence** that gives you no voluntary option
but to **change your mind**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Naturally, you have to
grant me access to your belief system, but this is part of what is
involved in agreeing to argue or agreeing to hear evidence. This fits in
neatly with our picture of essentially adversarial practices in all
three key ways but particularly with regard to the element of imposing.
My sharing reasons with you is the way imposing is practiced in
arguments. While [this is [**certainly** true of]{.mark} arguments
involving explicit **[disagreements]{.mark}**]{.underline}, it is just
as true of arguments in the broadest sense possible, including those
that do not involve any disagreement at all. The key feature of
voluntariness, as I am discussing it here, is that
[[others]{.underline}]{.mark}, even those with whom I agree, [[can alter
my **beliefs**]{.mark} in a direct way by exposing me to argumentative
**evidence**]{.underline}.

I should add a few cautionary notes about the distinction between
beliefs and commitments, for some might object that [typically [our
**commitments** track our **beliefs**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The things
we are committed to in argument, in other words, are typically the
things that we believe. The difference I mean to point out is rather
that [we are free to choose any particular commitment]{.underline},
develop arguments for it, and abandon it when we please.
[But]{.underline} this points to another important qualification. [It is
not]{.underline} entirely [the case that commitments are
**voluntary**]{.underline}. They are [[voluntary only in]{.mark} their
**[initial adoption]{.mark}**]{.underline}. I can choose, for example,
to defend the thesis that the Egyptian pyramids were built by space
aliens. Once I adopt that, however, I also acquire a series of other
commitments---that there are aliens, that aliens visited the earth, and
so on. To this extent, therefore, even commitments are involuntary. They
are involuntary, howev- er, by analogy to the rules of a game, and in
fact this was one of the ways Hamblin spoke of them. This is part of the
reason that commitment-centered argumentation theories speak about
argument "moves." Consider, by way of illustration, Walton (1998):

The concept of a dialogue, in the sense developed in this book, is that
of a conventionalized, purposive joint activity between two parties (in
the simplest case), where the parties act as speech partners. It is
meant by this that the [[two parties exchange]{.underline}]{.mark}
verbal messages or so-called **[[speech acts]{.underline}]{.mark}** that
take the form of moves [[in a **game-like** sequence of
exchanges]{.underline}]{.mark} (p. 29; emphasis added).

This means [the **adversarialism** of these encounters is]{.underline}
of the [derivative]{.underline} sort, [[where the **adversarial
position** is adopted **secondarily**]{.mark} to the
exchange]{.underline}. This differs in a key respect from beliefs, where
the involuntarism is not optional.

The idea that argument involves involuntary imposition is not a
particularly new one. Several authors, Gearhart (1979), Nozick (1981),
Foss and Griffin (1995), and Fulkerson (1996) have ad- vanced versions
of this view. We might call this view "argument pacifism," where
persuasion by argument is inherently something forceful, much along the
lines of sports or war, and hence to be avoided. To be clear, their
point is not that it is aggressively force ful---that arguers sometimes
push too hard or are too rough, disre- spectful or any of the other
things that Govier termed ancillary adversariality, but rather that
[[**persuasion** works]{.mark} in ideal circumstances [**against the
will** of the person being persuaded]{.mark}]{.underline}. Persuasion,
in this sense, violates equity; you're not treating the other arguer
fairly (Fulkerson, 1995). Sally Gearhart (1979) maintains that the
problem lies in the desire to change someone else, which, for her,
issues from a patriarchal desire to dominate:

Our rational discourse, presumably such an improvement over war and
barbarism, turns out to be in itself a subtle form of Might Makes Right.
Speech and rhetoric teachers have been training a competent breed of
weapons specialists who are skilled in emo- tional manoeuvers, expert in
intellectual logistics and, in their at- tack upon attitude and belief
systems, blissfully ignorant of their violation of nature or her
processes (p. 197).

Although Gearhart does not note the crucial role the involuntarism of
believing plays in this, Nozick comes much closer:

Why are philosophers intent on forcing others to believe things? Is that
a nice way to behave toward someone? I think we cannot im- prove people
that way---the means frustrate the end. Just as de- pendence is not
eliminated by treating a person dependently, and someone cannot be
forced to be free, a person is not improved by being forced to believe
something against his will, whether he wants to or not. The valuable
person cannot be fashioned by committing philosophy upon him (p. 5).

The indirect voluntarism of beliefs is a two-way street. While it may be
that a thoroughly persuasive argument leaves us in stunned silence or
with no other option, as Nozick suggests (p. 6), [we have **little
direct control** over our **belief system** anyway]{.underline}.
Argument, rational argument at least, may be the least invasive way to
man- age our belief system. [[Noting that]{.mark} persuasion is
forceful]{.underline}, in other words, [[does not entail that
**non-forceful** options]{.mark} even **[exist]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[[or]{.underline}]{.mark}, if they do exist, [that they [are any
**better**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The central feature of any essentially and naturally adversarial
practice is involuntariness. This bears on argument through the
involuntarism of belief. Argument, so far as it is belief-focused, is
essentially adversarial because to interact with someone's beliefs is to
attempt to compel them. Alternatively, it may be to try to frustrate
their acquisition of certain beliefs. As Nozick and Gear- hart note,
[such imposing should not be confused with **hyper-
aggressiveness**]{.underline}, or with ancillary adversariality. [It is
[a **structural feature** of]{.mark}]{.underline} the exchange we call
[[argument]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is worth repeating that the
compulsion of argument is not just a feature of persuasive argument
involving disagreement. Rather, it is a feature of argu- ment broadly
understood---including that which aims to strengthen the beliefs someone
already has (Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca, p. 49). To return to
Govier's argument for minimal adversariality, I should stress that while
Govier based the adversariality of belief in the difference of belief,
in disagreement as it were, this version of her view discovers
adversariality in the basic fact of manipula- tion of beliefs in
argument. [It is not because I have a **different belief** from you that
[we are **adversaries**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [it is [because of the
**lack** of direct **control** I have over my]{.mark}]{.underline} own
[**[beliefs]{.mark}** and you over yours]{.underline}.

SETTINGS

**[[Competition]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Classical persuasion experiments involve a single speaker sending a
message to receivers; there is scant attention to context. Yet, many
contexts involve multiple speakers trying to persuade the audience. To
see why this matters, consider a typical framing effect, such as when
people hear that a hate group rally should be thought of as a public
safety concern and not be allowed (Nelson et al. 1997). Invariably, the
involved group or another group will argue that the decision to allow
the rally constitutes a free speech issue. [[When two arguments
**clash**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[they could **cancel
out**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Sniderman & Theriault 2004). Chong &
Druckman (2007a), [[however]{.underline}]{.mark}, argue that
[[**competing rhetoric** prompts]{.mark} **effort**]{.underline},
[leading [people to opt for the **argument** they perceive as
**stronger**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The authors show that if the public
safety argument comes from a credible source and the free speech
argument comes from a noncredible source, then the public safety
perspective sways individuals (although see the discussion on argument
strength in the Message Content subsection of the section titled
Treatments). Yet, in general, studies of competitive persuasion remain
limited in the social sciences (Della Vigna & Gentzkow 2010, p. 665).

The number of receivers also matters. When someone hears an argument,
[the [presence of **others** can stimulate **normative
pressures**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Levitan & Verhulst (2016) show that
having others nearby shapes how people form their attitudes on issues
such as abortion, affirmative action, gay rights, and immigration.
[**[Receivers]{.mark}** look to [see how others **react** and **follow
suit**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Sinclair 2012). Alternatively, [if
listeners observe a **persuasive argument**]{.underline} targeting
someone else, [they may learn about its **applicability**]{.underline}
to themselves. Lupia & McCubbins (1998, p. 61) provide an example where
a Democratic observer hears a Republican speaker endorse a policy to
his/her Republican constituents. The Democratic observer then takes the
opposite stance (what the authors call an observer effect). This type of
dynamic partially explains the aforementioned backlash of targeted
messages among those not targeted (Hersh & Schaffner 2013).

#### Habits are [internalized]{.underline} and intervention is needed [immediately]{.underline}.

**Maiese '21** \[Michelle, Emmanuel College, "Mindshaping, Racist
Habits, and White Ignorance," 2021\] etkin

These [[patterns of **neurobiological dynamics** and **sensorimotor
coordinations**]{.mark} are self-sustaining]{.underline} and
self-reinforcing: "[[the more]{.mark} frequently]{.underline} [a
pattern]{.underline} of [behavior]{.underline} (i.e., sensorimotor
coordination trajectory) [is [**performed**, the more]{.mark} likely it
will be **[repeated]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the future" (Egbert and
Barandiaran 2014, 3). [Elements that support]{.underline} a
[habit]{.underline}, such as muscular dispositions and neural
connectivity patterns, [depend]{.underline} for their structural
stability [on the exercise of the sensorimotor coordination
patterns]{.underline}; these supporting elements are precarious in the
sense that [[they become **unstable** if]{.underline}]{.mark} they are
[**[not exercised]{.mark}** frequently **[enough]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
The exercise of a habit influences other sensorimotor schemes and
subsequent behavior patterns such that they are similar to behaviors
that have been executed in the past. [A given scheme calls for,
reinforces, or inhibits others, and]{.underline} the
[interdependence]{.underline} of schemes [makes them richer]{.underline}
in potentiality. What emerges is a self-sustaining behavioral "life
form" that integrates brain, body, and sensorimotor dynamics and allows
for new forms of coordinated activity. And because [the]{.underline}
habitual, [skillful body sometimes]{.underline} "takes over" and
[renders conscious reflection unnecessary]{.underline}, agents find
themselves with the mental and practical "space" to focus on other
things. Thus, habit formation is crucial for effective and intelligent
engagement with our surroundings; and yet the longer a habit operates,
the less obvious or noticeable it becomes.

While enactivist theorizing about habits has focused largely on
sensorimotor patterns and overt movement, it is important to acknowledge
that [habits]{.underline} also [are embodied in coordinated patterns of
attention]{.underline}. Just as sensorimotor patterns are reinforced
through repetition, [[what subjects]{.mark} tend to notice, emphasize,
or [**ignore** is modulated by]{.mark} what they]{.underline} have [paid
attention to in the past]{.underline}. In addition to habits associated
with coordinated and skillful movement, human subjects develop specific
habits of interpretation and judgment. Such [habits of mind encompass
**[schemas for]{.mark}** interacting and **[engaging]{.mark}** with
one's environment]{.underline}, and include, for example, a [tendency
to]{.underline} notice particular considerations, to [be guided by
particular assumptions]{.underline}, to make specific kinds of
inferences, [and to trust some]{.underline} sources of
[evidence]{.underline} while remaining suspicious of others. Fully
embodied habits of mind arise in conjunction with sensorimotor habits,
via the formation and self-maintenance of coherent neurobiological
configurations and built-up patterns of bodily attunement and
engagement. These interdependent, self-stabilizing patterns of behavior
and attention vary depending on context and what sort of endeavor is
undertaken; "particular sets of habits will be regularly displayed by an
agent depending on his current activities" and context (Ramírez -Vizcaya
and Froese 2019). As a result of ongoing interaction with the
surrounding world, there emerge sets of structured habits that allow
subjects to engage effectively with a wide range of socio-material
environments (see Arfini, this volume).

Egbert and Barandiaran (2014) note that [habits resemble autopoietic
biological processes]{.underline} in that both sorts of processes of
[[self-maintenance]{.mark}]{.underline} are "**[[contingent
upon]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [[existence of]{.underline}]{.mark} an
**[[appropriate environment]{.underline}]{.mark}**" (10). However, what
is unique about the human form of life is the significant influence of
social-relational factors: many habits are formed over the course of our
interaction with complex sociocultural environments. Just as biological
processes of self-maintenance depend on energetic resources, the
[formation and maintenance of habits [depends on **social
resources**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Many habits develop over the course of
continued interaction with a culture as subjects develop recurring
patterns of behavior tailored to specific contexts. Moreover, a human
subject's [adaptive regulation]{.underline} of environmental engagement
[is governed]{.underline} not just [by]{.underline} viability
constraints imposed by "survival conditions," but also by the [need to
fare well in]{.underline} a [particular]{.underline} sociocultural
[setting]{.underline}. Shared cultural practices scaffold **[[individual
enactments]{.underline}]{.mark}** of meaning by
"**[[prescribing]{.underline}]{.mark}** and normalizing [[**certain**
modes of experience and]{.mark}]{.underline} action while proscribing
(and perhaps **[[pathologizing]{.underline}]{.mark}**) certain
[[others]{.underline}]{.mark}" (Kirmayer and Ramstead 2017). [Customary
ways of]{.underline} performing various tasks, dividing up resources,
making decisions, [speaking, thinking, and feeling all become
second-nature]{.underline}. Insofar as the sociocultural environment
regulates and molds individuals' habits of behavior and attention, it
[[modifies]{.underline}]{.mark} their [**[neurobiological
dynamics]{.mark}** and patterns of bodily attunement]{.underline}. How
does this occur?

Coordination and shared activity appear to be at the center of human
sociality. De Jaegher and Di Paolo (2007) characterize "coordination" as
the non-accidental correlation between two or more coupled systems, so
that their behavior matches to a degree far beyond what is expected
given what those systems are capable of doing. Once two or more
interactors are part of a coupled system, their expressions, behaviors,
and bodily dynamics modulate those of the other person (s). Habit,
posture, and body alignment begin to resonate, so that other people
exert a contagious pull---often without our being selfconsciously aware
of it. Instances of mutual coordination in the realm of human activity
include synchronization, mirroring, anticipation, and imitation (De
Jaegher 2009). These forms of reciprocal bodily attunement (Stanghellini
2004, 91) and mutual modulation begin when we are infants and grow more
complex over time as we develop a range of projects that require us to
communicate with others, understand their actions and intentions, and
enlist their assistance. Such coordination, repeated over time, results
in highly integrated configurations of neurobiological activity and
movement that become sedimented in the body; the formation of such
habits involves a dynamic, multistable network of brain and bodily
processes, including the musculoskeletal system, metabolic systems, the
endocrine system, and the cardiovascular system

Building on these ideas, my proposed mindshaping thesis says that human
agents are fully embodied, and that their sense-making processes and
habits are partially determined, or shaped, by the social world (Maiese
and Hanna 2019). This notion of [mindshaping emphasizes]{.underline}
that [habit formation is inherently interactional, and that]{.underline}
the "partial determination" or "[shaping]{.underline}" of our embodied
[habits is]{.underline} fundamentally [normative]{.underline}. Remember
that at a basic biological level, living organisms gauge meaning and
value in relation to norms of self-maintenance and adaptivity. But at a
more sophisticated level, social norms and values that are
underdetermined by biology come into play; these normative constraints
are acquired via interaction with the sociocultural environment. [Social
structures prescribe and prohibit ways of]{.underline} thinking, acting,
and [interacting, and thereby]{.underline} both [regulate action and
constitute]{.underline} the meanings and [rules]{.underline} that enable
the enaction of social life. [[**Cultural norms** are
**internalized**]{.mark} and enacted]{.underline} not just as individual
habits, but also [as]{.underline} forms of [coordinated social
interactions]{.underline} in which there is a reliable expectation that
others will respond to or complement one's own action in specific ways.
For those operating within a particular social setting, "[certain
[models of **expectancy**]{.mark}]{.underline} come to be [established,
and]{.underline} the [patterns]{.underline}, which over time emerge from
these practices, [[guide]{.mark} perception as well as
**[action]{.mark}**]{.underline}" (Roepstorff, Niewöhner, and Beck 2010,
1056).

What Rietveld and Kiverstein (2014) call "situated normativity"
encompasses norms of adequacy and inadequacy associated with particular
sociocultural settings. Various societal structures and forces
contribute to mindshaping, including cultural institutions, pervasive
symbols, various forms of media, and political discourses and
institutions. Together, these sociocultural forces normalize and
reinforce habitual attitudes and dominant patterns of meaning-making. As
children engage with particular aspects of the environment, their
[[performance is **subject to**]{.underline}]{.mark} normative
[[**assessment** as **better** or **worse**]{.mark}, and as more or less
correct, given]{.underline} the [specific]{.underline} demands of the
situation and [sociocultural norms. By]{.underline} way of [[**explicit
nudging** or **implicit**]{.underline}]{.mark} communications of
[approval/[**disapproval**, children]{.mark}]{.underline} learn to
attend to the "right things" and focus on some facts and considerations
rather than others. They thereby [[acquire]{.mark} the [**habits of
mind** of]{.mark} their [community]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and [if they
**fail to**]{.mark} respond or **[behave]{.mark}** as expected, [they
will be]{.mark}]{.underline} corrected, scolded, or formally
**[[sanctioned]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and also encouraged to adjust
their attitudes and behavior. [[Those who
**internalize**]{.underline}]{.mark} these cultural
[expectations]{.underline} "[[develop dispositions to
participate]{.underline}]{.mark} in the practices fluently
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[**correct** those who
don't]{.underline}]{.mark}," so that there is a kind of "social
regulation system" that molds people's attitudes and behavior (Haslanger
2019, 21). In some cases, children even receive explicit instructions
that contribute to their habitual patterns of engagement. For example,
if a child is repeatedly told, "you say 'colored woman' and 'white
lady'---never a 'colored lady'" (Bailey 1998, 35), they are likely to
develop a habit of viewing women of color with disrespect. However, in
many cases these lessons are unspoken. White children pick up on the
avoidance of eye contact, the nervousness, and the spatial layout of
where people sit, and all these affectively charged elements help to
cultivate specific habits of mind. By way of emotional resonance and
mimicry, children learn to feel "at ease in white worlds where \[they\]
are fluent speakers, where \[they\] know and can safely animate whitely
scripts, where people of color are out of \[their\] line of vision, and
where \[their\] racial identity is not at risk" (Bailey 1998, 40).
People comply with social norms and expectations partly because there is
a sense in which it contributes to their human flourishing, as members
of a social group. Some interactions with the sociocultural world are
adaptive insofar as they enable the individual to fare well in that
social environment (to gain status and social recognition, for example),
and some are maladaptive (insofar as they involve heavy penalties or
social disapproval).

Venture into a bustling artery of any [[**capitalist**
society]{.underline}]{.mark} and you\'re likely to find yourself
[[enveloped]{.underline}]{.mark} by [[its **palpable**
manifestations]{.underline}]{.mark}: shimmering
**[advertisements]{.underline}** seducing you with the promise of the
latest commodities, financial institutions promising safe havens for
your wealth, [and]{.underline} corporations locked in [fierce
**competition** for]{.underline} your [patronage]{.underline}.

It\'s an undeniable reality that [capitalism [**sculpts** our tangible
world]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, what about the intangible realms of
our thoughts and emotions? A fresh wave of research is gradually
uncovering the subtle yet profound ways in which capitalism [[shapes our
**cognitive** processes]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[**emotional**
responses]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and **behavioral**
patterns]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The so-called \"**[[invisible hand]{.underline}]{.mark}**\" [of
capitalism [operates beyond]{.mark}]{.underline} the [confines of profit
and [markets]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It]{.underline} also [fosters
specific [ideologies]{.mark}]{.underline}---most notably those [of
**individualism**]{.underline}, **[materialism]{.underline}**, [and
**competition**]{.underline}---[that]{.underline} slowly
[[infiltrate]{.mark} our [societal structures]{.mark}]{.underline},
becoming deep-seated elements of our cultural fabric. Consequently, the
[influence of capitalism extends far **beyond**]{.underline} the sphere
of economic **[transactions]{.underline}**, [permeating our identities
and]{.underline} underlying [beliefs]{.underline}.

Yet mainstream psychology has largely overlooked capitalism\'s effects.
Textbooks tend to portray human thinking as universal to some degree,
when in fact it may be guided by the values and practices of the
societies, whether capitalist or not, in which people live.

One reason for this oversight may be the fact that [[**psychology** and
capitalism evolved together]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[making capitalism
seem **natural**]{.mark} when it is]{.underline} actually
[cultural]{.underline}. [[Psychologists]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[tended to [avoid **analyzing**]{.mark} capitalism]{.underline} under
pressure [[to **conform** to]{.mark} American [political]{.mark}
agendas]{.underline}, which cast such critique as radical or unpatriotic
(Fox, 1985; Prilleltensky, 1989; Ratner, 1997; Teo, 2015).

However, a [surge of emerging [**research** is
illuminating]{.mark}]{.underline} the [deep-seated influence capitalist
societies can exert on our **psychology**]{.underline}. Studies suggest
that [[mere **exposure**]{.underline}]{.mark} to money, for example,
[can [increase **self-centeredness** and diminish
**altruism**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Vohs, Mead, & Goode, 2006). Societies
that have embraced market economies tend to foster individualism (Taras,
Steel & Kirkman, 2016) and exacerbate inequality (Bettache, Chiu &
Beattie, 2020) over time.

Social class [[also influences **self-perception**]{.underline}]{.mark},
[with individuals from higher]{.underline} economic [classes
placing]{.underline} greater [**emphasis** on personal
choice]{.underline} and achievement (Stephens, Markus & Townsend, 2007).
Moreover, [marketing strategies stoke the flames of **materialism**
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} have a significant
[[impact]{.underline}]{.mark} on **[[well-being]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(Kasser & Kanner, 2004).

**[Capitalism]{.underline}** also [[interacts with **biases**]{.mark}
and stereotypes]{.underline} related to race, gender, and competition.
**[Discrimination]{.underline}** often [arises when]{.underline}
capitalism prompts [individuals]{.underline} to [view others as
**competitors**]{.underline} (Bobo & Hutchings, 1996).

[Gender biases]{.underline}, for example, [tend to be more
**prevalent**]{.underline} in societies with greater economic inequality
(Glick et al., 2000). [**[Neoliberal ideologies]{.mark}** that commodify
race]{.underline} can [further [perpetuate
**racism**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Goldberg, 2009). Even the [widespread
bias]{.underline} in which individuals perceive themselves as \"above
average\" can be [[traced back to **capitalist values** of]{.mark}
individual success and **[competition]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Zell et
al., 2020). By examining these biases in the context of competitive
capitalism, we gain a deeper understanding of their origins.

A Personal Paradoxical Decision I remember sitting in front of the
computer focusing on office work. Facing the screen, I had an
intolerable feeling, a total unwillingness to fulfill the "I need to..."
thoughts that kept me there. Writing emails felt like pushing the gas in
neutral. I realized that nothing positive could emerge from trying my
best. Becoming conscious of this feeling through sensations in my body,
I recruited courage to rise from the desk, step away from the screen,
and leave the office. I drove to the beach to do something else.
Personally, I enjoy singing in Gibberish. This is a major part of
Non-Linear Approaches/Non-therapeutic Psychotherapy that I started in
2004 and have been deepening ever since. (Concepts from this approach
are italicized below.) I now teach masterclasses on non-linear
approaches around the world. By non-linear, I mean not conventional, not
defined by cultural or social norms, not restricted to any one absolute
truth. Often this involves breaking up an old belief system. For
example, where a conventional approach might be to try to fix the
patient or administer an antidote, a non-linear approach might be to
evoke the symptoms and help the client accept and play with them. I
parked on the beach and went jogging barefoot on the sand, chanting in
Gibberish, and forgetting about the tasks that my judgmental self
believed I needed to fulfill. Talking in Gibberish is a way to bypass
the hyper self-criticism of the intellect and avoid being trapped in a
never-ending mental loop. I applied the concept of doing something else
to escape preoccupation, which minimized my mental turmoil and brought
me back to the present. As my mind calmed down, many insights related to
future projects flowed through my mind. I felt a great joy that I could
transcend the linear attitude driven by fear that I must sit and work in
the office. Instead of pursuing these tasks by forcing myself to think
them over excessively, I could let them proceed indirectly. Dr Viktor
Frankl once advocated that we not aim at success, a linear perspective,
but instead let it happen as a byproduct of being aligned with our
unique meaning and purpose, a non-linear approach. Hence,
self-dedication liberated me from the linear logic and associated fears
coming from society, governments, or culture. I was able to take
distance from the situation. I felt contentment and happiness being on
the beach, in the sun, not imprisoned in the office trying to produce
something. I was not driven by the fear that shows up as "I need to pay
my bills, so let's create more work."

\<\<PARAGRAPH INTEGRITY RESUMES\>\>

What are Paradoxical Decisions?

Paradoxical decisions are commitments that have nothing in common with
the person's usual outlook or ways of making decisions, although a
paradoxical decision might be a [deliberate contradiction]{.underline}
of past ways of action. Paradoxical decisions [[set up a **new private
logic**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Making paradoxical decisions requires a
humorous attitude, not only on the cognitive surface, but much deeper in
the sub-conscious mind, [that comes [from a]{.mark} [**conviction**
that]{.mark} the **[past logical ways]{.mark}** of action [have become
**useless**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Humor lets us see that we are mentally
stuck.

Paradoxical decisions may help people accept their situations as they
are. They may engender a playful attitude toward any consequences and
circumstances. They can [result in future **non-linear**]{.underline},
playful [actions]{.underline}. People taking paradoxical decisions tend
to assume a self-humorous responsibility instead of taking life and the
future too seriously. 

Self-humor is the faculty to recognize and accept our turbulent minds as
illusions. Self-humor can be also produced by explicitly exaggerating
seriousness in front of self and others. Self-humor helps us step out of
situations, opening up the ability to make paradoxical decisions.
Sometimes [people act **paradoxically** out of]{.underline} existential
and unfathomable despair, [[understanding]{.mark} that [**nothing can be
worse** than now]{.mark} and [**nothing can be lost** by taking a
**different direction**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 

Paradoxical decisions [[elicit
**self-empowerment**]{.underline}]{.mark}, assertiveness, and lightness.
Laughter dominates instead of the feeling of being condemned to apply
logical interventions to solve problems.

Another Example of Paradoxical Decisions

Here's another example. A 70-year-old lady at a kibbutz in Israel had a
recurrence of breast cancer after believing she was cured. Medical
authorities recommended conventional regimens including surgery,
radiation, and chemo. She decided instead to administer a paradoxical
intention as illustrated by Viktor Frankl in the words, "Today I am
going to have a stroke." She announced loudly, "I am going to grow many
carcinogenic tumors in my body." By doing that, she
administered self-acceptance, embodying a great sense of self-humor, and
accepting the cancer as a friend or gift, rather than an enemy. 

Then she made several paradoxical decisions. Instead of a long
conventional series of treatments, she decided to take a distance from
the situation by going on vacation in the Nepali Himalayas where her
daughter was already trekking. Accompanied by her supportive husband,
she fled Israel for Nepal for several months. She also went on an
organic, completely vegan diet without sugar-based foods. When she came
back to Israel, she tried some alternative methods to boost her immune
system, including bee venom therapy or Apitherapy. Her paradoxical
decisions allowed her to take distance from a fear-based mindset.
Surprisingly (or not) her tumors shrank. 

Conclusion

Paradoxical decisions can be [a possible [**resolution** when]{.mark}
people realize their [past **linear patterns**]{.mark} of action **[do
not work]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They might playfully contradict
themselves out of deep understanding that there is no need to take
themselves and the world too seriously. While admitting weakness,
disease, and imperfection, they can accept themselves fully, becoming
friends to themselves. There is no need any more to fix themselves using
mental effort. Instead they could use the paradoxical intention approach
suggested by Victor Frankl. This approach elicits self-humor, which in
my view, is a high form of humor and laughter. This reduces the need to
see life and the external world as a jungle. People can [easily change
**old patterns** of action and [step ahead into]{.mark}]{.underline}
refreshing, sometimes **[[rebellious]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[non-conventional **[behavior]{.mark}** that comes from]{.underline}
taking a distance from the problem, [making **paradoxical
decisions**]{.underline}, and playing along the way.

#### Fairly concluding to [reject]{.underline} procedural fairness [isn't paradoxical]{.underline} but [merely]{.underline} a result of prioritizing alternative forms of fairness.

1.2. [**Decision Dilemma** and **Conflict Resolution**]{.underline}

The selection of the decision choice is often governed by the desired
outcome in which [the **decision-maker** has to decide which
of]{.underline} the [**two variables** is more important]{.underline} to
choose to optimize. A conflict in decision occurs when maximization of
one variable will minimize the other, making it impossible to maximize
both. Thus, the decision requires choosing between one of the two
variables to maximize, when no other alternatives are available.

For the decision to choose between fairness and monetary gain, it is
often assumed that monetary gain will override fairness for the decision
in economic transactions, while fairness will override monetary gain for
the decision in social transactions. But sometimes, [there is [the
**paradoxical decision** that people can]{.mark} choose to [**forgo
maximization** of]{.mark}]{.underline} either
**[[fairness]{.underline}]{.mark}** or monetary gain [[to obtain the
**desired outcome**]{.mark} that [seems
**counter-intuitive**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

\<\<CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

This paper will explore the theoretical relationship between these two
decision criteria, and determine that a logically consistent decision
can be made by choosing the fairness criterion, without necessarily
choosing the monetary gain criterion to resolve the conflict.
Experimental confirmation of the decision model is provided in the
companion paper \[1\] to confirm that the decision can be made using
fairness as the decision criterion without necessarily relying on
monetary gain as a criterion In examining the decision-making process,
many studies use fairness as a factor to determine how decisions are
made in economic transactions \[2-5\] and distributive justice \[6-8\].
Fairness is also used as a factor to determine how decisions are
affected in social interactions \[9-21\]. Because what is considered as
fair (or unfair) is often biased by an individual's subjective
perception, and this bias can alter the decision made by an individual.
Thus, it is important to delineate the underlying decision-making
criteria so that we can quantify which factor is more important in
influencing a decision. Humans are not the only species that use
fairness as a criterion for making decisions, primates also use fairness
as a factor to make their decisions \[22\]. Thus, the decision- making
process is conserved across species in evolution from primates to
humans, which suggests that there is a generalizable universal principle
underlying the decision- making process. 1.3. Ultimatum Game as a Tool
to Determine the Decision- Making Process in Relation to Fairness
Decisions based on fairness have been studied extensively using the
classical Ultimatum Game (UG) experimental paradigm in behavioral
economics \[2, 23-27\]. UG is a split- the-money game where the human
subject's decision-making process is deduced from the decision to accept
or reject the monetary offer, depending on whether the offer is
perceived as fair or not \[27\]. The rule of the UG is that a proposer
offers an amount of money to share with the responder. The responder is
asked to make a decision to accept or reject the proposed offer. If the
responder decides to accept the money, both keep the money; otherwise,
both lose the money. Thus, the decision to accept or reject the offer in
UG depends on whether it is better to maximize the monetary gain or
maximize fairness in the decision criterion. This provides a useful tool
to determine which decision variable --- fairness or monetary gain ---
is more important to use as the decision criterion. Since the rule of UG
requires losing the money if the responder rejects the offer, it creates
a conflict for inequitable offers, in which the responder cannot
maximize fairness and monetary gain at the same time. If the responder
chooses money, it would not be fair. If the responder chooses fairness,
it cannot gain the money. Thus, it creates a dilemma for the responder
to decide which of the two decision criteria is more important to
maximize. This provides the condition in which the underlying
decision-making process can be examined theoretically, using a logically
consistent model, without violating any logical reasoning, or
contradicting any decision criteria. Numerous computational models for
hypothesizing the decision-making process based on fairness have been
developed to describe how fairness is evolved in UG \[25, 26, 28-34\]
using economic game theories \[4-7, 35, 36\]. We will introduce a
different theoretical model to account for the decision-making process
that can use a single criterion --- fairness --- without requiring
choosing both fairness and monetary gain as the criteria to resolve the
dilemma. Previous decision-making model has incorporated the relativity
of fairness considerations to describe how fairness and monetary
gain/loss considerations without compromising the decision for fairness
over monetary gain \[1, 37-40\]. This paper will derive a novel
decision-making criterion using the geometric quadrant of the
decision-space in the fairness- equity stimulus-response function for
determining how a decision is made (see Fig. 1 below). 1.4. Relativity
in Fairness Assessment in the Decision- Making Process In assessing
fairness in the decision-making process, there is an implicit comparison
between two entities --- self- regarding and other-regarding concerns
\[13, 14, 41\]. Without such comparison, equality and fairness would not
exist. When a comparison is made, it is usually based on one frame of
reference relative to another (i.e., comparing between self and others).
For example, when someone asks us how fair it is, it usually involves an
implicit computation to compare others relative to ourselves. In
computing subjective fairness, it compares self in relative to others,
using a self-centered frame of reference in the comparison. When the
frame of reference is switched from a self-centered one to an
other-centered one, fairness is also changed from fair into unfair
relatively --- without changing the amount of disparity between them. On
the other hand, objective fairness is computed by comparing the
disparity relative to both parties (self and others) using a neutral
party's (a third person's) standpoint. Thus, objective fairness is
computed by including other- regarding concerns using an other-centered
frame of reference, while subjective fairness is computed by including
only self-regarding concerns using a self-centered frame of reference.
Thus, the decision using fairness as the criterion can change depending
on whether a self-centered or an other- centered frame of reference is
used as the decision criterion. 2. The Relativistic Fairness-Equity
Model Expressing the above relativistic relationships mathematically,
let us define f as a quantifiable measure of fairness as a vector, and d
as the disparity vector between self and others. Then the level of
fairness perception in relation to disparity is given by: f = k ⋅ f
(d) + b (1) where k is the fairness sensitivity coefficient, b is a
constant representing the baseline fairness level, and f(d) is a
function of the disparity vector, which can be either a linear or a
nonlinear function. The disparity measure is a relativistic measure that
is opposite to the equity measure. Without loss of generality, the
disparity vector (d) is a vector difference between oneself and others
when comparing a quantity --- in the case of UG, the monetary difference
--- between two persons in the proposed monetary offer. The disparity
measure can take on a positive or a negative value, depending on whether
the disparity is in favor of oneself in the comparison. For instance, if
an offer is a bigger amount to oneself than the amount to the other
person, then the disparity is a positive value. If the offer is a lesser
amount to oneself than the amount to the other person, then the
disparity is a negative value. If the offer is the same for both the
self and the other person, then the disparity is zero. Since the vector
d is a signed quantity, Eq. 1 automatically accounts for the relativity
of fairness --- what is fair (f) for the self is unfair (--f) for the
other person. This relativity in fairness is automatically computed by
the change in the sign of disparity from a positive (d) vector to a
negative (--d) vector, when the frame of reference is switched from a
self- centered frame of reference to an other-centered frame of
reference. 2.1. Decision Threshold Using Fairness as a Decision
Criterion Note that Eq. 1 also corresponds to the classical stimulus-
response (SR) function for fairness in physiological or psychological
systems. This fairness stimulus-response function also corresponds to
the input/output (I/O) function in computer science. The stimulus is
disparity, and the response is fairness. For the UG paradigm, the
stimulus is the amount of monetary disparity between the two persons in
the offer (or the offer-ratio), which will result in either monetary
gain or loss if the responder accepts or rejects the offer,
respectively. The stimulus-response function is usually a non-linear
sigmoidal function in psychological or physiological systems, rather
than a linear function. Since the operating range of most living systems
lies in the linear physiological region (in the middle of the sigmoidal
stimulus-response function), for simplicity, we will use this linear
operating range as a first approximation in our model. That is, given
the disparity stimulus d, a person will respond with a fairness
perception computed according to Eq. 1. If the decision is based on
fairness as a criterion, then the fairness stimulus-response function
can be used to determine the fairness threshold in which a person
decides to switch from a rejection decision to an acceptance decision.
Thus, using this relativistic fairness-equity model, it will allow us to
quantify the threshold in which a decision is made, and determine
whether monetary gain can be captured in the fairness decision, without
using monetary gain as a decision criterion. 2.2. Relativity in Fairness
Assessment by Including both Self-Regarding and Other-Regarding Concerns
If the decision incorporates self-regarding concerns, it uses the
self-centered frame of reference to evaluate fairness for the decision
criterion. If the decision incorporates other- regarding concerns, then
it uses the other-centered frame of reference to evaluate fairness for
the decision criterion. This relativistic model of fairness can account
for both self-centered fairness (i.e., how fair it is to "me") and
other- centered fairness (i.e., how fair it is to "you") by Eq. 1. That
is, the equation implicitly incorporates not only a self- centered
perspective of fairness (using a local frame of reference), but also an
other-centered (non-self) view of fairness (using a global frame of
reference). 2.3. Switching Frame of Reference in the Evaluation of
Fairness Perception By default, this vectorial model has already
encapsulated the inclusion of reference frame implicitly by the signed
vector, d, in which relative fairness is computed --- i.e., "fairness to
me" is computed by f = k•ƒ(d), while "fairness to you" is computed by
the opposite vector, f = k•ƒ(--d). To explicitly express the relativity
of fairness, let us denote "fairness to me" as f (using a self-centered
frame of reference), and "fairness to you" as f\' (using the other-
centered frame of reference), with the primed notation. Then "fairness
to others" is given by: f′ = k′ ⋅ f (d′) + b′ (2) Thus, the decision
threshold can be determined by either Eq. 1 or Eq. 2, depending on
whether only the self-regarding concerns is incorporated into the
decision or the other- regarding concerns are also incorporated into the
decision. 2.4. Derivation of Decision Criterion Based on Fairness If the
decision is based on fairness, then the criterion to accept or reject an
offer is determined by the level of fairness. Let's say that the
decision threshold, θ, is located at neutral fairness level (θ = 0),
then the decision is to accept the offer if it is fair, and reject the
offer if it is unfair. The decision, δ, would be quantified by: +1, if
f ≥ 0 δ=−1, iff≥0 (3) where δ = +1 represents an acceptance decision
while δ = --1 represents a rejection decision. If the decision threshold
is located at a positive fairness level (θ \> 0) for a fair perception
or a negative fairness level (θ \< 0) for an unfair perception, then the
decision is determined by: 2.5. Fairness Bias by Shifting the Baseline
Level of Fairness Perception The baseline level of fairness perception
is given by the y- intercept of the stimulus-response function f =
k•f(d) + b, i.e., the constant b in Eq. 1. Thus, any bias in the
fairness baseline level is represented by a change in the constant, b.
If the baseline bias is toward a more fair level, then the constant, b,
will increase. If the baseline bias is toward the unfair level, then the
constant, b, will decrease. This quantification of this fairness bias
will allow us to determine how a decision can be affected by a change in
the fairness baseline level. 2.6. Decisions Bias Resulted from Changing
the Baseline Level of Fairness Perception

\<\<PARAGRAPH INTEGRITY RESUMES\>\>

[Let us [assume]{.mark}]{.underline}, without loss of generality, [that
[the **decision criterion** is **fairness**]{.mark}]{.underline}, then
[the decision would be determined by the level of fairness
**perceived**]{.underline} by the person. Furthermore, if the decision
threshold were set according to the fairness level as defined by Eq. 4,
then any change in fairness baseline level would alter the decision
threshold accordingly.

That is, [any [**bias** in]{.mark} the [**fairness perception**
will]{.mark} also **[bias the decision]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In other
words, if the decision to accept is determined by fairness, and if the
decision to reject is determined by unfairness, then when the fairness
perception is shifted/switched from fair to unfair. The decision, δ,
will also change/switch from acceptance (δ = +1) to rejection (δ = --1)
according to Eq. 3, if the decision threshold is set at θ = 0. For any
other non-zero decision threshold, the decision, d, is given by Eq. 4.

The above logic is generally assumed in the decision- making process
when fairness is used as the criterion by most of the UG studies
\[42-47\]. But there are exceptions to the above assumption that seem
paradoxical. Sometimes, [[humans accept **unfair
offers**]{.underline}]{.mark}, while other times they may reject fair
offers. When this occurs, it is [often **assumed** that the decision
is]{.underline} either [**irrational** or]{.underline} the [decision is
made using some]{.underline} other [criteria other than
fairness]{.underline} \[42-47\]. But this assertion may not be
necessary. We will show below, by using the relativistic fairness-equity
model, that [the [decision can]{.mark} still [be made with
**fairness**]{.mark}]{.underline} as the criterion [[without being
**irrational**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and without incorporating some
other factors **other than fairness** as the criterion]{.underline}.

\<\<CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

2.7. Fairness Bias by Changing the Fairness Sensitivity Fairness
perception can also be biased by a change in fairness sensitivity rather
than a change in fairness baseline. Fairness sensitivity is quantified
by the slope, k, of the stimulus-response function in Eq. 1. If the
slope, k, increases, the sensitivity to fairness is heightened with a
much more exaggerated sense of fairness. If the slope, k, decreases, the
sensitivity to fairness is diminished with an indifference perception to
fairness. Thus, there are two types of fairness biases --- baseline bias
and sensitivity bias. Baseline bias affects the sense of what is fair or
unfair, whereas sensitivity bias affects the heightened or diminished
awareness of fairness or unfairness. Baseline bias is quantified by the
y-intercept, b, and sensitivity bias is quantified by the slope, k, of
the fairness stimulus-response function, f = k•f(d) + b, in Eq. 1. By
the same token, if the decision criteria were based on fairness, then
fairness baseline, fairness sensitivity, or both can bias the decision.
Thus, a decision may be altered by changing the y-intercept, b, or the
slope, k, of Eq. 1. This summarizes the dependence of decision on
fairness biases mathematically. 3. Graphical Representation of the
Decision Phase-Space Quadrants Let us represent the objective disparity,
d, graphically by the x-axis (independent axis), and the subjective
fairness, f, by the y-axis (dependent axis) based on the fairness
stimulus- response function, f = k•f(d) + b, in Eq. 1 (see Fig. 1). The
same graph is essentially divided into the left-half and the right-half
by the y-axis representing inequity (hypo-equity) and hyper-equity,
respectively. The graph is also divided into the upper-half and the
lower-half by the x-axis, representing a fair and an unfair perception,
respectively. When a decision is made, it is made based on the condition
of fairness and equity according to the specific quadrant as described
below (see Fig. 1). 3.1. Interpretation of the Decision-Space in the
Relativistic Fairness-Equity Quadrants Combining the above fairness and
equity interpretations, the decision-space in which the decision is made
can also be subdivided by four quadrants (see Fig. 1): (a)
Upper-left"fairandinequitable"quadrant; (b) Upper-right "fair and
hyper-equitable" quadrant; (c)
Lower-right"unfairandhyper-equitable"quadrant; (d) Lower-left "unfair
and inequitable" quadrant. +1, δ =  − 1 , if f ≥ θ i f f ≥ θ ( 4 ) 
\<\<FIGURE OMITTED\>\> The interpretations of the fairness perception in
each of the quadrant are provided below: (a) If the decision is made in
the upper-left quadrant decision-space, then it is a lenient decision
--- it is based on the condition of feeling fair even though it is
inequitable (see Fig. 2). (b) If the decision is made in the upper-right
quadrant decision-space, then it is a fair decision --- it is based on
the condition of feeling fair when it is hyper- equitable (see Fig. 2).
(c) If the decision is made in the lower-right quadrant decision-space,
then it is a greedy decision --- it is based on the condition of feeling
unfair, even though it is hyper-equitable (see Fig. 2). (d) If the
decision is made in the lower-left quadrant decision-space, then it is
an unfair decision --- it is based on the condition of feeling unfair
when it is inequitable (see Fig. 2). 3.2. Relativistic Interpretation of
the Fairness-Equity Quadrants when the Frame of Reference is Switched If
the frame of reference for evaluating fairness is switched from self to
others, then the fairness-equity quadrant graph would become a mirror
image of the decision-space graph in Fig. 1. That is, what is
hyper-equitable to self is inequitable to others, and vice versa. Thus,
these graphs represent subjective fairness based on their own frame of
reference. The only exception to this subjectivity is the center
dividing line at the absolute equitable offer (disparity d = 0 at x-axis
origin), where it is equitable to both self and others, objectively. At
this vertical y-axis, the proposed offer is absolutely equitable for
both self and others. Thus, the dividing vertical line represents
objective fairness relative to any neutral third party (independent of
the relative self- centered or other-centered frame of reference).
\<\<FIGURE OMITTED\>\> 3.3. Decision Criterion Based on Offer-Ratio If
the decision criterion were based on the monetary offer- ratio in UG,
then it also corresponds to the decision criterion based on the
disparity variable in the relativistic fairness- equity model. For
instance, if the acceptance decision criterion were set at a specific
offer-ratio (at a specific disparity), then the decision space would be
divided vertically into two halves instead of four quadrants. The
vertically dividing-line is the decision threshold that is based on
disparity. This dividing-line is a given by: d=ε (5) where ε is the
specific offer-ratio (or disparity) used to determine an acceptance
decision. The decision criterion based on disparity is given by: +1, δ
=  − 1 , if d ≥ ε i f d \< ε ( 6 ) 3.4. Determination of the Decision
Threshold using Both Fairness and Disparity Criteria Given that the
fairness stimulus-response function in Eq. 4 is used as one of the
decision criteria and the disparity in Eq. 6 as the other criterion,
then the intersection of these two decision thresholds would determine
the exact location (quadrant) within the fairness-equity space in which
the decision were made. If both fairness and disparity were used as the
criteria, then the decision space where the decision is made is given
by: +1, δ =  − 1 , if f ≥ θ and d ≥ ε i f f \< θ a n d d \< ε ( 7 )

\<\<PARAGRAPH INTEGRITY RESUMES\>\>

Any decisions made outside of the decision space in Eq. 7 would
[appear]{.underline} as [irrational]{.underline}, because it is
inconsistent with using both fairness and disparity as the criteria.
[But such [**paradoxical decisions** are]{.mark} not]{.underline}
necessarily irrational, but [rather caused by using solely **one**
decision **variable** as the **criterion**]{.underline} --- [such
as]{.underline} using either **[fairness]{.underline}** or disparity as
the criterion. Examples of such paradoxical decision spaces are:

+1, if f ≥ θ and d \< ε\
δ =  − 1 , i f f \< θ a n d d ≥ ε ( 8 )

+1,

if f \< θ and d ≥ ε i f f ≥ θ a n d d \< ε

δ =  − 1 ,

( 9 )

It is [only **paradoxical** if **both criteria** were used]{.underline},
as in Eq. 8 and Eq. 9. [But if **one** of the criteria were
used]{.underline}, as in Eq. 4 or Eq. 6, **[[no
paradox]{.underline}]{.mark}** or irrationality [would
exist]{.underline}. The [paradoxical decision spaces]{.underline} in Eq.
8 and Eq. 9 [would merely be a subspace captured]{.underline} by either
Eq. 4 or Eq. 6, **[resolving the paradox]{.underline}** or
irrationality. That is, if a person decides based solely on the fairness
criterion, irrespective of the disparity in the monetary offer, or if
money is not an issue for the person, then it is perfectly rational to
reject money, because money is not an issue. There can be many other
reasons to reject an equitable or accept an inequitable, nonetheless
monetary gain/loss is not one of the criteria.

3.5. Identification of Decision Criteria in the Decision Space with
Respect to the Fairness-Equity Quadrant

Given that the specific perception of fairness and equity can be
represented by the fairness-equity quadrants, we can identify the
decision criteria by the graphic location of the quadrant in which the
decision threshold is located. That is, if the acceptance decision is
located in the hyper-fair and hyper-equitable (upper-right) quadrant,
and the rejection decision is located in the unfair and inequitable
(lower-left) quadrant, then the decision made is often considered as
logical/rational. The exact location of the decision threshold in these
quadrants is dependent on the fairness biases, as reviewed in the above
sections.

3.6. Rational Decisions due to a Shifting of the Decision Space into a
Paradoxical Fairness-Equity Quadrant

On the other hand, if the decision is located in the hyper- fair and
inequitable (upper-left) quadrant, then the decision appears to be
paradoxical, [when a person considers **inequitable offers** as **fair**
in the **decision**]{.underline}. Most often, [this **paradoxical
decision** is assumed to be irrational]{.underline}, [but]{.underline}
in fact, [is **logically consistent**]{.underline} with the relativistic
fairness-equity model. This is because the location of the decision
criterion is merely being shifted to the upper-left quadrant by the
fairness biases in the stimulus-response function. Thus, this results in
a decision bias that seems paradoxical or illogical, but it is [[merely
caused by a **shift**]{.mark} of the decision space [into a different
**fairness-equity** quadrant]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[without
contradicting]{.mark} any [**logical principles** for **fairness
assessment**]{.mark} or decision-making]{.underline}. It is [merely a
result of the **fairness bias**]{.underline}, [which subsequently
affects the decision]{.underline}.

Similarly, [if the decision is located in the unfair and hyper-
equitable]{.underline} (lower-right) [quadrant]{.underline}, then [the
[decision appears]{.mark} to be [paradoxical when a person considers
**hyper-equitable** offers as **unfair** in the
decision]{.mark}]{.underline}. This paradoxical decision is also
[appeared to be **irrational**]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} in fact,
[is **logically consistent** with a shift in the **decision space** into
the lower- right fairness-equity quadrant]{.underline}, [without
contradicting any **logical principles** for **fairness assessment** or
decision-making]{.underline}.

The paradoxical decision can be identified as a shift of the decision
space in the fairness-equity quadrant caused by a shift in the fairness
bias.

3.7. Decisions Based on Fairness Criterion Rather than the Monetary Gain
Criterion

Because the amount of monetary gain or loss in UG is directly linked to
the amount of disparity in the offer when a person accepts or rejects
the offer, an acceptance decision would result in a monetary gain, and a
rejection decision would result in monetary loss. Thus, if monetary gain
or loss were the criterion for the acceptance or rejection decision,
then monetary offer of any amount would always result in an acceptance
decision, independent of fairness. Therefore, the decision space for
acceptance decision would span all four fairness-equity quadrants.

Thus, the monetary gain or loss is a consequence of the decision rather
than the criterion of decision in UG. That is, if a person accepts the
money, it will always be a monetary gain. If a person rejects the money,
it will always be a monetary loss. The monetary gain or loss is caused
by the decision. If the decision were to use monetary gain or loss as
the criterion, then the decision is already predetermined, without any
regards to fairness or disparity. If the decision were not predetermined
by the consequence of monetary gain or loss, then a person could use
fairness, disparity/equity or both in the decision criterion (assuming
fairness and disparity/equity were the two given choices in the
decision, as in the UG paradigm).

If either one criterion --- fairness or disparity/equity --- were used
as the decision criterion, then no paradoxical or seemingly irrational
decision would exist. If both criteria --- fairness and disparity/equity
--- were used as the decision criteria simultaneously, then there are
some conditions in which [the [decision]{.mark} may [appear to be
**paradoxical**]{.mark}]{.underline} (as in Eq. 8 or Eq. 9).
[[But]{.mark} such **paradoxical decision** is merely a **shift** of the
decision criterion into the decision space]{.underline}, which is
[[caused by a shift in]{.mark} the **[fairness
perception]{.mark}**]{.underline} (i.e., [caused a **fairness
bias**]{.underline}) [[rather than]{.mark} being
[irrational]{.mark}]{.underline}. The experimental evidence in the
companion paper \[1\] also showed that human subjects behaved precisely
as predicted by the relativistic fairness- equity model, which is
logically consistent without being irrational when they rejected the
monetary offer.

4\. Summary

The mathematics of the decision-making process using fairness and
disparity as the decision criteria is derived theoretically using a
relativistic fairness-equity model. The results show that the
[[logically consistent decisions can be made **using**]{.mark} either
**[fairness]{.mark}** or **[disparity]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[or
both]{.underline}]{.mark} criteria, [[without being]{.underline}]{.mark}
irrational or [[paradoxical]{.underline}]{.mark}. The monetary gain or
loss is a consequence of the decision in UG rather than a decision
criterion, unless the decisions were predetermined by the monetary gain
or loss. These logically consistent decision criteria were deduced
graphically by the location of the fairness-equity quadrant in which the
decisions were made. The location of the decision space quantifies the
rationale in which the decisions were made, i.e., the decision criteria
used in making such a decision.

#### Procedural fairness is a [capitalist]{.underline} tool that silences [resistance]{.underline} AND [reproduces]{.underline} battle fatigue.

Human Rights Law as Unfreedom," vol. 31, pp. 256-9\]

**[[Procedural fairness]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Perhaps the most important element related to the right to a fair trial
in this case is the fact that the court imposed a truncated timeline on
Nyanzi's defence and violated her right to call and examine witnesses.
These arguments are read as possible, but do they stand? And if so, what
are their limitations?

[Forcing]{.underline} (and it is forcing because it is done through
law's enforceability) [one to go through the **process**]{.underline} of
a fair trial is worth looking at. Needing to ask for a fair trial is in
a sense needing to ask for permission to be fairly treated within the
polis. And yet, as we know, fairness [is an abstraction that
[**assimilates** us into the]{.mark}]{.underline} moral-legal scales of
**[[police]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Fairness]{.underline} in a [trial is
**never granted** without a sweat]{.underline}, it is always
conditional, it is always struggled for, always contested, [always
[weighed against a **liberal frame** of value]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
hence always [easily]{.underline} flexibly **[suspended]{.underline}**,
easily [abrogated]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} easily
[disposed]{.underline} of. [The sovereign remains
**absolute**]{.underline} Lord and law giver perfectly subjecting all to
inadmissibility [before the law]{.underline}. [Fairness as an
**entitlement**]{.underline} under law [would be **undergirded**
by]{.underline} the [social-contractual demands]{.underline} of the
police/polis [and **contingent** on]{.underline} morality and respect
for [the **police**]{.underline}/polis.

Inasmuch as Nyanzi won the case, or indeed won the right to be
right-with, her 'winning' is worth probing. [What is
[winning]{.mark}]{.underline} if only [[within a **pre-limited**
structure]{.mark} of liberal emancipation?]{.underline} Is [winning
merely a game of]{.underline} "[telling the **truth** about
oneself]{.underline}" (Foucault 2014, 14), or is it penance/penalty/a
penal code, that operates in adversarial non-resolution and that can be
won by only law itself? What does 'winning'---or losing for that
matter---account for with regard to understanding of concepts such as
truth, lies, guilt, innocence, morality, and sin?

I want to suggest that winning a case in law or through law is what
makes one finally right-with the state. Through law's mathematics of
un-life, [law always manages and **coerces** individuals to
conform]{.underline} to the polis and to count themselves as a part of
the polis. Law [[ensures]{.mark} that [we
**forfeit**]{.mark}]{.underline} elsewhere [[modes of
relation]{.underline}]{.mark} in order [[to **contract** ourselves to
a]{.underline}]{.mark} polis/**[[police order]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
that we become right-with, on the right side of the police as citizens.
This is [a conceptual abstraction that]{.underline} already [**arrests**
performances and imaginations of **freedom**]{.underline}, one [that
always already **assimilates** the beyond of law]{.underline} and
[to]{.underline} this end [**neutralises** its radical
**potentiality**]{.underline}. I would go even further, following Nancy,
to suggest that the [ideological discourse of **h**uman **r**ights law
replicates a **fascizoid** vision]{.underline} to the extent that it
calls upon the symbolic themes of national regeneration and discipline
(Nancy 1990).

[Law is always]{.underline} already **[unfair]{.underline}**, always
already [**predisposed** to]{.underline} challenge a witness, to throw
them off or to make them right-with its own interpretation of
**[truth]{.underline}** as right. This is perhaps why there were no
witnesses. The disorderly and their interlocutors can have no witnesses
before the law. The disorderly shall have no witnesses to/in the polis.
There is no collective experience or memory of it, hence no sharing, and
hence no 'witnessing for the witness'. Sovereign presence which is
absent without ground must still prevail and guard itself without
showing to have done so (Derrida 2005).

At this point, we should remember again [that law is an operative
**arithmetical** mechanism of order]{.underline}, a mathematics [of
**unlivingness**]{.underline}/unlife, [that [calculates an
**ends-and-means-oriented** justice]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Legal
**calculation** [involves tactical losses]{.mark}]{.underline},
[delays]{.underline}, adjournments, subtractions,
[substitutions]{.underline}, deferrals, referrals,
[[reviews]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[cross-examinations]{.underline}]{.mark}, retreats, recoils,
[appeals]{.underline}, diversions, disappearances, and displacements.
**[[Repetition compulsion]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It is worth noting
that such diversional retreats are merely legal-inquisitorial [and
interrogatory **manoeuvres**]{.underline}. At no rate does this mean
that legal violence in the trial is relinquished. In fact, on reading
Kafka, Derrida (1992) and Vismann (2008) highlight that [the **goal** of
these interdictions and interruptions]{.underline} (which are really
repressions) [is to **bolster** the sovereign's ideal of
morality]{.underline}/decency/purity and prevent its contamination by
the testimony of the disorderly so as to keep Nyanzi right-with. In
other words, [it would be [**tautological** for law to disprove
itself]{.mark}]{.underline} via witnessing or witnesses, [as this [would
**undermine** its]{.mark} own rightness]{.underline}-with [under a
**Kantian** universal moral law and **utilitarian**
compass]{.underline}. All this, as I have mentioned above, is suggestive
of [law's **[police drive]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [whose ultimate
function is to **fortify**]{.underline} absolute sovereignty and [its
**police order**]{.underline}.

Certainly, law does not want to be caught out. It cannot be caught out;
the fiction cannot fail. Because the law wants to make and mould and
portray Nyanzi as right-with, it will not admit disorderly witnesses.
The sovereign through law must appear to concede a loss this time to
buttress the potency of law. This is a non-contradiction.

Crucially, this loss, which is in actuality non-loss or "a neuter that
annuls oppositions" (Derrida 1992, 209), is also an enactment of the
visor effect---wherein "we do not see who looks at us" (Derrida 1994,
43)---which is a marker of the sovereign's supreme sign of ungraspable
and incomprehensible power. Benjamin and Derrida remind us that legal
authority needs a visor effect, a faceless figure, a gestalt/gestalotos.
This is precisely why the law hears Nyanzi, but Nyanzi cannot be heard
by the very law that she is called upon or, rather, that she is coerced
into calling upon.

The victory further obfuscates Nyanzi's positionality within the polis.
Yes, she has arrived, as a citizen, but she also has not arrived. Law
wants to make this clear through this moment of obfuscation. [Legal
**obfuscation**]{.underline}, like all police obfuscation, [is
**conducive** to power]{.underline}, its confusing omni-topological
administrative infrastructure (Kalulé and Trafford 2020), [runs circles
around us]{.underline}, holds us boundaried, in check, sitting, not yet
standing and thus right-with the police. It [mutes or [**procedurally
silences** us]{.mark}]{.underline}, causing us [to hallucinate in a
doubt of memory]{.underline} lodged within ourselves.
**[Silence]{.underline}**. [Impenetrability]{.underline}.
[Exclusionary]{.underline} nags. **[Separation]{.underline}**.
Adversariality. [[One]{.mark} never knows whether they will
win]{.underline} or if they do not win [because they are excruciatingly
[**pummelled** with]{.mark}]{.underline} external [[procedural
**adjournments** that]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[meld into]{.mark}
internal **[psychologistic violences]{.mark}** and
obstacles]{.underline}. [The possibility of a legal [victory]{.mark} is
[laced with]{.mark} impenetrable]{.underline} hyper
**[[alertness]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[anxiety]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and
**trauma**]{.underline}]{.mark}. And so, when they win, they haven't
truly won because their freedom has been curtailed time and time again
to the point of aporetic irresolution.

[This [**aporetic** structure of wins and
losse]{.mark}]{.underline}[s]{.mark} and repeals and amendments [is
produced by and]{.underline} still [follows]{.underline} [the
escalatory]{.underline} and de-escalatory [logic of the **force of law**
and]{.underline} of **[liberal freedom]{.underline}**, interminably.
What then happens is a phantasm of justice that makes us right-with and
robs us of the unattainable rights to liberal freedom. In the end, [a
legal victory is a **divine** sign of law's dominance]{.underline} (and
redemption) as right-with. [It places the victor in an **emancipatory**
state of suspension]{.underline} wherein the victor has rights but only
rights within limits. Moreover, following my discussion of inconsistency
earlier, it [becomes clear that in victory]{.underline}, [one is never
**assured** of]{.underline} one's [rights]{.underline}, as these [can be
**taken away** in the future]{.underline}, again, before the law, at a
time adjourned without end. Justice through victory arrives or happens
through subjection---but in doing so, it does not happen, ad infinitum.

Put differently, human rights, justice, and [liberal freedom as
**supplementary** programmes]{.underline} of law [cancel themselves
out]{.underline} yet at the same time redouble compulsively in the trial
by reproducing themselves [through the **requirement** of needing one to
be right-with by entering the **violence** of law]{.underline} and being
suspended in a permanent trial of right(s) and wrong. The very need to
stand right before [the law]{.underline} pulls or
[[inscribes]{.underline}]{.mark} Nyanzi within [[an
**inescapable**]{.mark} structural dialectic or [**double bind** of
**unfreedom**]{.mark}]{.underline}. All this does in the end is [to
reinforce and establish the potency of **h**uman **r**ights law
as]{.underline} the **[universal]{.underline}** sovereign's
ur-signature/ur-text.

Justice as law's victory

A [**victory** will be given but]{.underline} it [is not really a
victory because the **sovereign** knows]{.underline} that [they have
still **restrained** one's **agentic freedom**]{.underline} and subsumed
it in the polis. [[Victory]{.underline}]{.mark} merely [[serves as a
**means**]{.mark} of restructuring the **socio-topography** of the
polis]{.underline} and not undoing it. The polis [remains a **police**
system]{.underline} run by law operating through law and through legal
guardianship and custodianship. [Legal victories do nothing to
**unsettle** the sovereign]{.underline}. [Their purpose is [to
**secure** and **extend**]{.mark}]{.underline} the survival of [[the
sovereign]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[A]{.underline} '[loss]{.underline}' [is]{.underline} precisely [of **no
effect** to the sovereign]{.underline}, [for it is not [a
loss]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It [is a **co-option**]{.mark}]{.underline}
or arrest [of the disorderly into a **dialectical**]{.underline}
(win/lose) [legal-juridical system]{.underline} of constraints. Which is
to say, winning or losing is how the sovereign makes the disorderly
right-with [[by **reorienting**]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[sacrificing]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and repositioning their
actions]{.mark} and performances into the **dialectical**
fold]{.underline} and sphere [of the]{.underline} polis
politics/**[police]{.underline}**.

At any rate, [there is **nothing** much for us to celebrate]{.underline}
with such a 'victory'. [[Victory remains a **perpetual subjection** to
the]{.underline}]{.mark} gewalt, i.e.
**[[violence]{.underline}]{.mark}**, dominance, and authority [[of
law]{.underline}]{.mark}. There is not much [one]{.underline} can do
with such victories apart from paying costs like court fines and health
bills and [waiting for when the law will next pick them
out]{.underline}, [discipline]{.underline} them, [and punish
them]{.underline}. Indeed, after her legal victory, Nyanzi collapsed as
she left court; at the same moment, "scuffles broke out between her
supporters and prison wardens, who fired live rounds into the air to
disperse the crowd" (Okiror, 2018). In this instance, we see [the
violence of law [continuing to be dispersed]{.mark}]{.underline} even
after the court admits that the right to a fair trial is violated.
[[Winning]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore [**[safeguards]{.mark}** the
promise of [legal violence's own **futural
repetition**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the end, all legal 'resolution'
lingers as nonresolution. Law always already curtails the rights and
freedoms of those it makes right-with.

#### No [fairness paradox]{.underline}. Yes, [subjectivity shift]{.underline}.

Rather than the more conventional (at the time) classroom experience of
textbook reading, film watching, worksheets, and lectures, we were
organized into teams that moved through a variety of [experiential
**games**]{.underline}: farming, the Constitutional convention, playing
the stock market, the **[[debates]{.underline}]{.mark}** over slavery
and abolition. In each unit, we were [[tasked with
**solving**]{.underline}]{.mark} various
**[[problems]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Robison's \[2008\],
"achievement-bound systems"): keeping a farm afloat in spite of the
vagaries of weather and the commodities markets, managing a stock
portfolio, forging a new nation, avoiding or starting a civil war. Our
teachers acted as our Dungeon Masters, introducing each round with a new
set of calamities and opportunities (a sudden drought, a market
collapse, a political crisis over the expansion of slave labor).

These [[**achievement-bound** systems
**involve**]{.mark}**d**]{.underline} a mix of [assimilation and
**[critical questioning]{.mark}**]{.underline}: we had to play the stock
market game (there was no opting out of the market, and the market
equally defined the farming game) and we had to (or were supposed to)
stick to our appointed roles: representative to the convention,
abolitionist orator. Yet [**[over and over]{.mark}** instances of
[**challenging** the **premises** kept arising]{.mark}]{.underline},
especially in the Constitutional convention game, and not always (or
even mostly) [for]{.underline} what might be considered
[intellectually]{.underline} and rhetorically [polite
reasons.]{.underline} Boredom, a desire for attention, our vexed
adolescent relationship to teacherly/parental approval---all figured in
the subversive mix I count as "challenging the premises."

[**Instead** of **undermining** the experiment,]{.underline} however,
our [[toggling between trying to **solve** a **problem**]{.mark} within
the defined **procedures** of **the game** [and **challenging** the
**premises** of **these procedures**]{.mark} and definitions of these
problems (our not always **taking** these **games "seriously"**) only
[**made** them]{.mark}]{.underline} all the [[**more "realistic"**---and
**effective**---in highlighting how **ego**, insecurity]{.mark}, and
**social status** affect and **[shape]{.mark}** these ["real world"
**games**]{.mark}]{.underline} (including the game of the high school
classroom). Three takeaways for me from this pre-Oregon Trail
educational gaming experience: important career lessons (never, ever go
into farming); [the profound [**impact** of]{.mark} the dramatized
[writing and **speaking**]{.mark} practices we engaged in that
essentially **[constitute]{.mark}d** the
**[games]{.mark}**]{.underline}, especially an appreciation for [the
**power** of **pathos** and **ethos**]{.underline}; and finally, how
this one class remains easily my most memorable (official) pedagogical
experience of high school, one I am still thinking through 45 years
later, certainly one definition of what Robison (2008) means by "rich
literacy and learning practices."

#### The concept of development that the aff promotes is inherently rooted in capitalist, Western ideals and shapes the world. The alternative is reimagining

Introduction

To accept the necessity for development, one must first accept one's
relative inferiority and inadequacy and the need to evolve and advance
towards something else. 

Globalization is said to be the defining convention of the new
millennium. For the Third World, however, development is the most
important concept in the international system, for it is development
that defines and locates the Third World within the international
community. Whether praised or excoriated, defended or condemned,
"development" shapes and dominates most thinking about Third World
nations. Indeed, the [peoples and nations of the world have come to be
characterized in terms of their development or lack
thereof]{.underline}. [[Development has evolved into an]{.mark}
essentially [incontestable paradigm]{.mark} with such a powerful hold on
our collective imaginations [that it is]{.mark} almost [impossible to
think around it.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Since the advent of "development" in the early 1950s, Third World
nations have demanded more meaningful assistance from monetarily richer
countries and more control over their political and economic destinies.
Their demands have been largely rejected and/or ignored, and the
assistance that has been made available has been accompanied by
countless conditions. These conditions have often yielded disastrous
results, including ever-mounting debt for numerous Third World
governments and increasing deprivation for the very people the
development project purports to assist. Even when measured in terms of
its own stated goals and objectives, development has, for the most part,
failed. As "experts" have promulgated widely varying and often
contradictory theories and strategies, it has become increasingly
apparent that they do not in fact know how to achieve the objectives
that ostensibly define their expertise.

This article does not contend, however, that the experts need only
devise the appropriate strategy, nor does it simply critique
micro-development, civil participation, market-led development,
sustainable development, gender and development or other current
variations in an exceedingly long list of variations on the development
theme. We do not assert that money is all that is needed, or that
industrialized countries need only assume their responsibility to bring
civilization to the desperate masses of the Third World. Rather, we
challenge and interrogate the very concept of development.

[[Development is a set of practices and beliefs that are part of the
Western political and cultural imagination,]{.underline}]{.mark} despite
being presented as universal, natural and inevitable. [The
[development]{.mark} paradigm]{.underline} comprises a pervasive and
largely unquestioned set of interlocking ideological assumptions that
[must be exposed and then questioned]{.underline}. [It [presumes
a]{.mark} universal and [superior way of ordering society]{.mark}, and
that all societies are to advance]{.underline} toward the same goal.
[Local and [indigenous cultures]{.mark}]{.underline}, economies,
self-concepts, and ways of existing [[are]{.mark} largely [without value
in this discourse]{.mark}]{.underline} (notwithstanding recent attempts
at "local participation"), for [the entire development project is
premised on its subjects "developing" into]{.underline} something else
-- and that something else is [the West]{.underline}. Thus, in the name
of modernization, cultures have been destroyed, communities uprooted or
eradicated, and whatever sovereignty emerging nations possessed has
virtually disappeared.

The concept of [[development]{.mark} privileges certain]{.underline}
societies, cultures and institutions, while disparaging others; it is
grounded in [[defining the "Other" as incompetent, inferior and in need
of transformation]{.underline}]{.mark}. That most "undeveloped" people
are people of color only reinforces the Western view of the developing
world as essentially dysfunctional, for it comports with American views
of brown and black people in the United States. For Europeans the
development project continues the colonial civilizing mission. Taking up
where colonialism and the "White man's burden" left off, the
[[development]{.mark} project provides the legal and moral justification
for substantial interventions in the affairs of those who have been
categorized as underdeveloped. It [justifies and supports the
economic]{.mark} and political [status quo]{.mark} and the imbalance of
international power, and it renders the underdeveloped powerless, for it
is the developers who name subjects, problems and
solutions]{.underline}.

The objective in the following pages is to construct and then
deconstruct the concept of development, and to question whether
development is so fundamentally flawed that it should be abandoned in
favor of a post-development paradigm.

Part I constructs the theory of development, beginning with the
discovery of global poverty after the Second World War. It establishes
how poverty is in some respects socially contingent, and how the notion
of global poverty suddenly homogenized and problematized the lives of
the majority of the world's peoples. With the impending Cold War and the
disintegration of colonial empires as crucial backdrops, industrialized
nations set out to eradicate poverty and bring the benefits of
modernization to the impoverished masses of the newly de-colonizing
world, and thus development as we now know it was born. From its
inception, development was informed and shaped by the meta-narrative of
modernization, which is explored as the primary theoretical foundation
for the undertakings that were to follow. Law and development is also
analyzed as the legal manifestation of modernization theory and as an
additional theoretical underpinning of development.

Part II explores how development has been constructed in practice. It
begins with the international financial institutions that form the
institutional edifice of the development project with particular
emphasis on the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. It then
focuses on the succession of often-contradictory economic experiments
and development theories that have emanated from these and other
institutions. Development theories have run the gamut as sustainable
development, micro-development, women-centered development, endogenous
development, appropriate development, 'Basic Needs', and both state and
market-led development have all had their days in the sun. What began as
economic growth to eradicate poverty evolved to include "enhancing
participatory democratic processes", "enlarging choices", "affording the
opportunity to develop to one's fullest potential", "participation in
decisions affecting one's life", and affording the "means to carry out
national development goals and promote economic growth, equity and
national self-reliance." One consistent theme, however, is that the
development project has grown ever larger and more comprehensive. More
disturbingly, international financial institutions now determine policy
in many Third World countries -- much in the way colonial powers once
did. Yet, despite myriad inconsistencies and the well-documented pain
and disasters that have resulted from their strategies, these
institutions and the concept of development enjoy continuing and largely
uncritical support within the international community.

Part III turns to legal constructions of development and the seriatim
attempts by Third World nations, over the past fifty years, to use
international law in the pursuit of development. These efforts began
with the demand for Permanent Sovereignty Over Natural Resources, and
then turned to broader demands for a New International Economic Order.
When these failed, Southern nations asserted a Right to Development,
seeking to incorporate development into the burgeoning rights discourse.
Reparations are the most recent evolution in the campaign for economic
justice, as some Third World nations now demand compensation for the
exploitation and crippling consequences of slavery and colonialism. To
the extent that these initiatives sought to establish legal obligations
for the West, they have been unsuccessful. As this section demonstrates,
[international law has only reinforced and reproduced the economic and
political inequities present in the international economic
system]{.underline}.

Part IV turns to deconstructing the discourse of [[development]{.mark},
demonstrating that it [is a method of]{.mark} [conceptualizing the world
that,]{.mark} in turn, [shapes the world]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although
portrayed as a neutral and universal concept, [development is planned,
directed and controlled by specific international and national
institutions]{.underline} that act in ideological concert and reflect
the views and interests of certain communities, societies and cultures.
This ideology creates and defines the "Other" while providing the legal
and moral rationale for interventions that locate and cement the Third
World on the lower rungs of the international system[. Development is
[the product of a particular perspective and]{.mark} [that]{.mark}
[perspective problematizes and homogenizes the majority of
humanity]{.mark}. [Deconstructing this discourse]{.mark}
[suggests]{.mark} that it is at least possible to [imagine a
post-development world and to perceive the people of the Third World in
a fresh light.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Given the failures of development, the power relations it engenders, and
its generally negative and degrading view of non-Western peoples and
cultures, Part V attempts the very difficult [[task
of]{.underline}]{.mark} [[envisioning a different approach to thinking
about the world]{.underline}]{.mark}. No new meta-narrative or grandiose
strategy to replace the development paradigm is proposed, for we aim to
reject, rather than substitute, meta-narratives. Nor is it our objective
to glorify and resurrect Third World traditions, for tradition is seldom
faultless and idyllic. Third world peoples have had varied and complex
encounters with development. These experiences must not be
over-simplified. Our objective is to begin to envision approaches that
accord agency to the people development presumes to assist. We hope that
these [[alternative]{.underline}]{.mark} visions can [somehow [give
voice to the local]{.mark}, including the voice [to embrace,
transform]{.mark}, [reject]{.mark} or otherwise engage the West and the
entire [modernization]{.mark} project. We believe [the West must]{.mark}
[abdicate some of the power]{.mark} it has presumed [and]{.mark} to
begin to [re-imagine the lives and agency of
others]{.mark}]{.underline}, and in the process perhaps reject often
unarticulated but crippling assumptions about "the Other." The objective
is to pose different questions, to let others pose questions, to learn
to listen and to actually hear the responses of others rather than
assuming that the answers are already known.

#### Development is inherently capitalist and fails -- it's an endless cycle

International Political Economy in the School of Government and

Capitalist development

[One of the most powerful bourgeois ideological sleights of hand has
been the naming of capitalist development as simply
development]{.underline}. 'Development' discursively serves to
naturalise what is a profoundly disruptive and political transformation,
a transformation based in an imposed reallocation of property and wealth
that relies on an invigorated and restless putting to work of people,
requiring sustained and muscular state action. A transformation, above
all, that is extremely risky and unlikely to succeed.

**[[Development is capitalist development]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This
means not only that [[it is]{.mark} [very]{.mark} risky and
[likely]{.mark} [to fail]{.mark}]{.underline} but also that it is very
unpleasant. The bourgeois coinage of development is that it is stable,
incremental, and positive sum. In a word: liberal. Liberal development
strategies---operationalised through a massive institutionalisation of
international aid from the late 1950s---is in essence a theatre of
global fantasy, a fantasy in which capitalist development is reimagined
as a planned, inclusive, and socially just modernisation. [[The
ideological erasure]{.mark} [of]{.mark} enclosure, corporal punishment
in law, [forced labour]{.mark}, slavery, [genocidal]{.mark} frontier
[expansion]{.mark}, theft and fraud, [and war from the]{.mark} concrete
[manifestations of capitalist]{.mark} [development has been
sustained]{.mark}]{.underline} through the rolling out of a
multi-trillion-dollar aid industry underpinned by an international elite
institutionalism.

The fact is that capitalist development is fundamentally Hobbesian:
nasty and brutish; destructive of existing community and extremely
exploitative. It is in the DNA of [[capital's]{.mark}
[ascendance]{.mark} that it [remakes societies for its own
purpose]{.mark} and [the foundation of that]{.mark} purpose
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} not 'making money' or 'earning income' (the
liberal vocabulary) but [[maximising profit]{.mark}, [and
extracting]{.mark} surplus [labour]{.mark}: again and again, [maximally
and forever.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Abstract

A dialectical relationship between 'big D' Development (broadly, the
formal interventionist, international Development sector) and little 'd'
development (the immanent structures and processes of capitalism) is a
concept widely invoked in Geography and Development Studies. In this
paper, we ask how the d/Development dialectic is evolving under current
conjunctures of emergent state capitalism(s). We suggest that, going
beyond 'containment', [[Development is]{.mark} ever more [deeply
inhabited by (capitalist)]{.mark} development;]{.underline} with
implications for its palliative and restructuring roles, and for praxis,
contestation and transformation.

I. Introduction

A number of critical development theorists have elaborated on the idea
of 'big D' and 'little d' d/Development (e.g. Cowen and Shenton, 1996;
Hart, 2001, 2009; Lewis 2019; Rigg 2004), and it is widely referenced
within Geography and Development Studies teaching and research (e.g.
Horner, 2019; McLennan and Banks 2018), albeit as Lewis (2019) points
out, often in 'shorthand' ways. We suggest that the d/D dialectic --
always dynamic, variegated and complex -- is in a period of discernible
change. Hart (2009: 120) analyses 'how [[the]{.mark} instabilities and
[constant]{.mark} redefinitions of official [discourses and practices of
Development]{.mark} since the 1940s [shed light on the
conditions]{.mark} in which we [now]{.mark} find
ourselves';]{.underline} and in this paper, we seek to show that
[[current Development ideologies]{.mark} and approaches reveal and
[reflect]{.mark} the new conjuncture of [state
capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline} Where we differ from Hart is in our
analytical emphasis. She proceeds as a scholar of political economy,
providing a deep analysis of the capitalist crises of the 1970s and
beyond. We approach the evolving d/D dialectic primarily as scholars of
'big D' Development, situated in particular research and professional
histories.

#### Exploration of the Arctic paints an imaginary of empty land that builds the [global capitalist system]{.underline}.

[What we think of as 'the Arctic' is made up of several countries or
states and many Indigenous cultural entities; in addition, there is
geographical variation in terms of flora, fauna,wildlife and weather.
The phrase 'the Arctic' obscures this diversity and signifies a space
that is largely empty and insignificantly peopled]{.underline}. Spaces
are historically changing and are created through interactions ranging
from the local to the global (Massey, 1994). [[The dominant]{.mark}
[Arctic imaginary is rooted in concepts developed and promulgated by
polar explorers from North America]{.mark} and Europe from the
mid-nineteenth century on]{.underline}, such as Isaac Hayes, Knud
Rasmussen, the Pearys and Robert Bartlett. [The imaginaries of the
explorers [buoyed]{.mark} [the colonial project]{.mark} at least from
the mid-nineteenth century onwards [and]{.mark} thus laid the
[foundation for the present-day neoliberal approaches takenby global
actors in Arctic places]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as Greenland. In the
words of Urban Wråkberg [[Envisioning polar regions as a land of promise
for science and a potential source of wealth for the global economy
continues to inspire the post-colonial world']{.mark} (2009, p.
92).]{.underline}

This paper focuses on depictions of Greenland and Greenlandic Inuit in
English-language explorer accounts dating from 1872 through the 1920s on
the premise that these accounts reinforce the Arctic imaginary that
helped establish Greenland's ongoing subordinate position in the global
economy. It responds to Avango et al.'s call to decon-struct
'articulations of the future from the past and present to reveal power
relations'(2013). As Avango et al. further assert, [historical analysis
is '[especially appropriate']{.mark} inorder [to]{.mark} [locate
actors]{.mark} and networks and their presumed authority [to
define]{.mark} [the Arctic and articulate its futures]{.mark},
sidelining and even erasing the Indigenous presence.]{.underline}
Indigenouspeople, of course, were in the Arctic for millennia but have
only recently been recognizedas deserving attention in economic and
political fora (Avango, Nilsson, & Roberts, 2013).This recognition is
more institutionalized and significant in some cases more than
others(Koivurova, 2008). [With only a foothold in organizations shaping
Arctic futures, [such as the]{.mark} [Arctic Council]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} a lack of constitutional recognition in [countries]{.mark}
such as Sweden,Indigenous peoples are frequently an afterthought rather
than a pillar of Arctic discourseand the visioning and planning of
Arctic futures. Arctic exploration itself facilitated thesubsuming of
northern regions into larger capitalist economies, which were often in
oppo-sition to and thus undermined Indigenous economies]{.underline}.
The Arctic imaginary of the polarexplorers posits Indigenous people as
peripheral, offstage while explorers assume centerstage positions. This
marginalization places Greenland, for instance, in a subordinate
pos-ition in the global market economy, where it remains. Greenland
itself often disappears indiscussions and policies; it is subsumed by
the structure known as 'the Arctic'. [This paperdemonstrates how
[imaginaries developed in the past continue to define the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}, specifi-cally Greenland, one of its
constituent parts. As Jonathan Greenberg stated, policy-makersneed to
know the history of the peopled Arctic, so 'indigenous
self-determination, resourceconservation and environmental stewardship'
can occur (2009, p. 1308). The developmentof Arctic imaginaries is part
of this history. [The [explorers']{.mark} enduring influence [allows
for]{.mark} anexternal [shaping of economic and political neoliberal
activities]{.mark}]{.underline} in Greenland, limitingIndigenous
influence. These neoliberal activities privilege market exchange,
substitutingit for other ethical belief systems (Treanor, 2005) such as
Indigenous beliefs in whichare rooted alternative relationships with the
land. Neoliberalism is also a governancemodel that situates competition
and self-interest as the preferred route to effective andefficient
government (Steger & Roy, 2010). Thus, there is no room in the
neoliberal frame-work for, say, Indigenous approaches to governance,
including, for instance, collectiveownership or even non-ownership of
what are today called natural resources. Climatechange, uninvited by
Inuit and representing a serious interruption of their relationshipwith
their environment, is one manifestation of the exclusion of Inuit
frameworks along-side the ascendancy of neoliberal economics.Historical
background: paving the way for neoliberalism.

This paper analyzes a number of texts written by explorers who visited
Greenland and whopublished and lectured widely in Europe and North
America on their activities, makingthe Arctic part of the national
landscape for Americans (Robinson, 2010) and Europeans.Collectively, the
accounts of the explorers considered here span the period of the
mid-POLAR GEOGRAPHY 103nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth century.
This period encompasses the most activeand influential era of Arctic
exploration -- the late nineteenth century when Denmark,Britain, Canada,
Norway and other countries used exploration to finalize their
claims,extend their sovereignty and cement their political hold on the
Circumpolar Region.For instance, led initially by Icelandic-Canadian
explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson, theCanadian Arctic Expedition was aimed
at expanding Canada's presence in the WesternArctic (Hanrahan, 2015).
Europe and North America remain central to Arctic futuresas their
actors, such as the European Union and Canadian mining companies,
propelindustrial ventures in Greenland.

[Western exploration of the Arctic dates back several hundred
years]{.underline}. In the 1570s,Martin Frobisher called Greenland Meta
Incognita. Many others followed. Three centurieslater, a Swiss group led
by Alfred de Quervain as well as the German expeditions of
AlfredWegener, credited with originating the theory of continental drift
(McCannon, 2012).Thus, Europeans and North Americans inherited the
Arctic imaginary of explorers likeHayes and Peary. Isaac Hayes
(1832--1881) was an American physician--explorer, whovisited Ellesmere
Island, now part of Canada, and Greenland on two expeditions. The
con-troversial Admiral Robert Peary (1856--1920), after many years of
studying Arctic travel,claimed in 1909 to be the first person to reach
the North Pole. Peary's wife Josephine Die-bitsch Peary (1863--1955)
accompanied her husband to Greenland with great publicity(and,
remarkably, tolerated his affairs and the existence of his Greenlandic
Inuitfamily). Diebitsch Peary over-wintered in Greenland, explored it,
and gave birth to herdaughter, Marie, known as 'the Snow Baby,' and
promoted by the Pearys as the firstwhite child to be born in Arctic
Greenland (Diebitsch Peary, 1901). Also reviewed hereare texts written
by the Greenlandic-Danish explorer and anthropologist Knud
Rasmussen(1979--1933) and Newfoundlander Captain Robert Abram Bartlett
(1875--1946) who wasPeary's navigator in the admiral's two attempts to
reach the pole. Bartlett made over 40voyages to the Arctic and was a
prolific writer. Through his Arctic voyages, he added con-siderably to
the scientific collections -- or 'fruits of the American empire'
(Robinson, 2010,p. 19) -- of the American Museum of Natural History and
the Smithsonian Institutes.Earlier, Hayes, too, had purposively allied
himself with science (Robinson, 2010, p. 66),thus (with others) laying
the groundwork for the early twentieth century polar researchstations
that dotted the Arctic (and Antarctic) landscape. These stations
featured culturallyspecific architectural styles that enabled countries
to establish a national presence in theArctic. As Wråkberg explains,
'This was to somehow indicate the predestination, or atleast
suitability, of the explorers' culture to colonize and expand into the
polar regions'(2009, p. 81).

There were others, too. Although it appeared that Arctic exploration was
waning afterseveral centuries, at this time print culture allowed the
very receptive public to vicariouslytake part in Arctic (and Antarctic)
voyages. Elisha Kane, like Hayes an American phys-ician, had created
precedents by selling more than 150,000 copies of his two volumeArctic
Explorations published in 1853 (Robinson, 2010, p. 54). Hayes, the
Pearys, Bartlett,and Rasmussen (as well as Edward Shackleton, who went
to Ellesmere Island, Stefanssonand others) sold well-received books and
were regularly featured in newspapers of recordsuch as the London Times
and the New York Times as well as the popular National Geo-graphic.
Frequently explorers became object of personality cults; Robert ('Bob')
Bartlett'smanly image appeared on Wheaties cereal boxes in the 1930s and
1940s as part of the food104 M. HANRAHANmanufacturer's 'Champs of the
USA' series (General Mills, 1942). Controversy, such asthat which
surrounded Peary's dubious assertion that he reached the north pole and
hisfellow American Frederick Cook's identical claim pertaining to the
previous year(Bryce, 1997), only added to the intrigue which surrounded
explorers and the attentionthey received. Print material usually
featured ample photography of unnamed Inuit inkayaks, Inuit in colorful
Greenlandic clothing, Inuit holding spears or guns and so on.Print
materials were supplemented by the lectures the explorers gave
throughout theUnited States, Britain and Continental Europe; Hayes, for
instance, lectured widely(McCannon, 2012). [Public display and public
performance were integral to polar explora-tion in this era for both the
survival of the activity itself and the advancement of the econ-omic,
political and colonial goals that both propelled it and were propelled
by it (Farley,2005). Most importantly, the explorers had the attention
of elites]{.underline} (Robinson, 2010, p. 2).[Fêting of the explorers
cemented the links between their presence in the Arctic andnational
activities and objectives]{.underline}; Peary received awards from many
geographical societiesin European countries such as Italy and Belgium,
for instance, as well as honorary degreesfrom the University of
Edinburgh and Bowdoin College in the United States, which alsogave
Bartlett an honorary masters. Kane's body lay in state and his funeral

[The third I shall refer to as [extractive rents and value
grabbing]{.mark} (a deep resonance here with Mason's introduction), a
body of work that has collectively [addressed]{.mark} the question of
[contemporary capitalism]{.mark} and rule by rentiers (Mazzucato 2018;
Piketty 2014; Standing 2016). At the heart of this work too is an
engagement with the extractionabstraction interface]{.underline}. Not
surprisingly, fi nancial rentiers, which is to say fi rms engaged
primarily in fi nancial activities and earning revenue primarily through
the ownership and exploitation of fi nancial assets, have been in the
spotlight, the principal agents of what has come to be seen as the
dominance of Wall Street and fi nance capital. [As a form of critique,
[rents are seen]{.mark} [as]{.mark} "unearned" (rather than productive
as a source of accumulation) and owners of [land, mineral
resources]{.mark}, intellectual property, [and a panoply of
other]{.mark} incomegenerating [fi nancial and non-fi nancial
assets]{.mark} are seen [to exercise a sort of hegemony within a
neoliberalized and fi nancialized capitalism]{.mark}. When economists
refer to a rent seeking political economy, they typically invoke a lack
of market competition and hence the source of rent is state intervention
or restrictions on economic activity]{.underline}. Others see rent as

Not for resale. 194 \| Michael J. Watts trol of assets (including fi
nancial assets) that are scarce or artifi cially rendered scarce.
Implicit in diff ering explications of rent---too complex to enter into
here---is the notion of a monopoly of power not only of ownership or
control but in the marketplace. In this sense rents are income derived
from the ownership, possession, or control of scarce assets under
conditions of limited or no competition (Christophers 2019, 2020).

Central to the rentier world so defi ned is the determination and
distribution of property rights that are not deployed to produce new
commodities but rather to extract value via rent (what has been called
"value grabbing" through "pseudo-commodities" see Andreucci et al.
2017). [There is, to take the idea of a planetary extractive system, an
expanding class of rentiers operating in the interstices of, for
example, the multiple agents in the oil and gas assemblage (fi nanciers,
commodity traders, oil insurgents, politicians, military, corporations,
and so on) who as it were profi t without producing]{.underline}
(Lapavitsas 2009). Rent-bearing assets---how they are created, their
opportunities to extract value, and confl icts and struggles over the
property rights that underlie them---are pivotal to contemporary
capitalism, and to extraction in particular. Certainly, the state fi
gures centrally in rents because: (i) it typically creates and
institutes property rights; (ii) regulates, enforces, and legitimates
the distribution of rights and titles and their use; and (ii) because
(and this is especially so in oil state), it is itself or acts like a
landlord (a "land appropriating state" or "landlording state"5 ). But
these rights might also inhere in international law or through
multilateral institutions. Either way, as Andreucci et al. (2017: 38)
put it, "the proliferation of private property relations over everything
imaginable signifi cantly expands the terrain for rent extraction and
related struggles."6 All of this moves extraction into multiple
registers and multiple forms of abstraction.

[But planetary extraction and the dominant forms of neoliberalized fi
nance capital associated with it, point to the importance of the massive
proliferation]{.underline} of rents and rent opportunities---"value
grabbing"---to the operations of the oil and gas assemblage. This is no
longer solely a product of corrupt rent-seeking petro-states but
operates across multiple spaces and sectors, across the licit and
illicit, and among cores and frontiers, a development which has the eff
ect of highlighting the blurring of conventional boundaries and borders
in thinking about the global political economy of extraction. This is
very much one aspect of Bennett's notion of the "double frontier" in
this volume.

I want to conclude with two other brief illustrations that speak to the
extraction-abstraction interface and that highlight a number of threads
running across the chapters---questions of sensing, iconographic images,
and forms of representation---and, to quote from Mason's introduction,
how abstractions mediate ecological, political, technological, economic,
and cultural inversions of value brought about by energy extraction in
the Arctic and the transformation of vulnerability into forms of value.
The forms of spatial abstraction--- cartography and GIS for example---is
especially relevant in the Arctic as the work on the ice edge has shown
(see Steinberg and Kristoffersen 2017). The map is of course not the
territory and questions of the conditions of production, circulation,
and legitimation of such maps---of Arctic edge, or the sea fl
oor---require precisely the sort of engagement with real abstractions
that this volume raises.7 Mason's chapter on the graph is especially
generative here and is an echo of other work some of the chapters
address, namely sensing. Mason's examination of the graph---political
aesthetics, and to invoke Mallarmé (2012) at the head of this chapter,
the relations between aesthetics and political economy---can be
productively situated on a larger canvas of what Buck-Morss (1995) and
others have called "envisioning the economy," that is to say how the
abstractions of capitalism (capital, the market, divisions of labor) are
displayed. The history of visualization is key (Friendly and Wainer
2021; Halpern 2015). Buck-Morss (1995) shows using classical political
economy how the economy---fi xing and making it---is a representational
problem (e.g., Toscano and Kinkel 2015), a sort of cognitive mapping of
the sort Mason describes in the Alaska oil and gas sector. There is a
powerful echo in the ways that Mason depicts graphs put to work and the
much earlier inventions of graphs and pie charts---the
seventeenth-century Dutch cartographer working for the Spanish court,
Scottish engineer William Playfair working for the Royal Navy---who saw
clearly that a story, a narrative, a history could all be "physically
seen on a page by abstracting it along a thin inked line" (Fry 2021).

To conclude I want to focus on two abstractive issues: the "digital
Arctic,"8 and the abstractive processes of commodity trade. On the
digital Arctic, let me begin with Kalvin Henely (2012): "If you think of
Wall Street as capitalism's symbolic headquarters, the sea is
capitalism's trading fl oor writ large." Deepwater resource exploitation
of various sorts---oil extraction at eight thousand feet in the Gulf of
Mexico, or deep-sea mining of polymetallic nodules off shore in Papua
New Guinea---and the world of oceanic extraction---a sort of model of
"high tech" logistics and circulation if ever there was one---off ers up
many of the insights into the hyper-extraction world of logistics, fi
nance, and the operations of contemporary capital and geopolitics.

Two vignettes. On 2 August 2007, a Russian submarine with two
parliamentarians on board planted a titanium fl ag two miles down under
the North Pole. At stake were the lucrative new oil and gas fi elds---by
some estimations ten billion tons of oil equivalent---on the Arctic sea
fl oor. A decade later in December 2017, the US National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)---a signifi cant arm of the US
Department of Commerce---released a report proclaiming a "New Arctic,"
signaling massive, irreversible phase changes in the material
composition of the Arctic Ocean and its peripheries.9 A world of
forbidding sea ice is now construed through the lens of runaway melt,
thaw, liquefaction, and off -gassing. A new ocean is in the making,
demanding to be observed, represented and documented, exploited, and
policed at multiple scales.10

Confronting new systems of global oceanic and atmospheric circulation, a
vast constellation of satellites, drones, buoys, cables, supercomputers,
servers, and sensors will give form to the New Arctic, a digital ocean
whose geo-economic and geostrategic value inheres in its rendering as a
calculative, computational domain (Steinberg and Kristoff ersen 2017). A
liquid Arctic is both a knowledge and infrastructural frontier---calling
on new forms of "environmental intelligence" (EI) and logistical orders
of extraction, circulation, and securitization to come into being. But
it is also a new frontier of accumulation, a so-called trillion-dollar
ocean. What is at stake is building a logistics space for the
Anthropocene.

One part of this digital Arctic story is expressly about oil and gas.
Deepwater oil and gas production in the Arctic (and elsewhere) is, of
course nothing new; the logistical and infrastructural investments in
the oil and gas global supply chain has already left its profound
footprint not simply on the ocean fl oor but in and through the oceanic
world (pipelines, fl ow-stations, risers, rigs, tankers, tank-farms, gas
fl aring vents, semi-submersible rigs, blowout preventers, and so on).11
It is now commonplace for test wells to delve through seven thousand
feet of water and thirty thousand feet of sea fl oor to tap oil in
tertiary rock laid down sixty million years ago. One test well might
cost over \$250 million. A great deepwater land grab is in train:
primitive accumulation at seven thousand meters. Warming wrought by
global climate change has opened Arctic prospects containing an
estimated eighth of the world's remaining oil, and a quarter of its gas
(according to the US Geological Survey). Geographer Leigh Johnson (2010)
calls this positive feedback loop capital "accumulation by degradation."
The arrival of peak oil has triggered increasingly high-risk techniques
and geographies of extraction, especially in deep water and the extreme
environments of the Arctic's oceanic milieux. The research involved in
this turn has resulted in ever more sophisticated sensing, mapping,
modeling, and simulation of each phase of oil production.

[[NOAA has adopted environmental intelligence]{.mark}---rebranding
itself as "America's environmental intelligence agency" [to]{.mark}
explicitly [mold]{.mark} the [New Arctic policy narrative]{.mark} as a
security concern [through]{.mark} the problem of data [production,
management, and deployment]{.mark}]{.underline}. Adapted from
long-standing military-scientifi c techniques of geographic,
meteorological, and otherwise geophysical knowledge production, EI
enframes the New Arctic through an established military-industrial
academic complex operating at many levels: structural, logistical,
infrastructural (see Arroyo 2021). The scope of ocean monitoring is
widening, and an infrastructure is being built to span the oceans.
Getting things---information, commodities, people---in circulation
entails a sort of mapping of the margins, the new oceanic frontiers, and
given the deep history of oceanic life, projects of capitalization,
extraction, militarization, territorialization, and policing. DARPA (the
US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) has a unit---the Ocean of
Things, a play on the Internet of Things---that aims to deploy fifty
thousand sensors across one million square miles of sea.

[What distinguishes the contemporary variant of EI, however, is [the
addition of speculative fi nance capital and its logics of risk to the
equation]{.mark}, mobilizing this complex in new
directions.]{.underline} By giving shape to the risk landscape, EI
becomes a strategic domain of value in itself that maps out possible
scenarios and multiplies speculative opportunity through the trafficking
of New Arctic futures. EI asserts the broader ascendancy of geospatial
data in the valuation and evaluation of risky, uncertain futures as a
space of economic and political securitization---it is a sort of
emerging market---and makes use of the vast resources of Silicon Valley
rather than secret state technologies and military satellites, ships,
and other sensing platforms typical of Cold War--era big science. Bay
Area fi rms focus on small, automated, cheap systems---from Saildrone's
unmanned solar and sail-equipped sensor packages to Planet Labs' cubesat
swarms---to produce data market ready for just-in-time maritime
logistics, everywhere-war security operations, and of course for the
extractive sector.

[[The very idea of a new]{.mark} [Arctic]{.mark} Ocean [maps]{.mark} out
[an abstract space: yet to-be observed, represented, exploited, and
policed at multiple spatial and temporal scales]{.mark} (this is part of
the stakeholder narrative in regard to sensing provided by Hepsø and
Parmiggiani). EI arbitrates and mediates in other words the New Arctic's
figuration and governance as a fi eld of risk and opportunity. [In
delimiting the New Arctic as an epistemic object and expanding the means
by which the region's strategic worth might be evaluated, NOAA's coinage
of the New Arctic might appear to be a predominantly American project of
a techno-political sort]{.mark}, but it is [a supranational
enterprise]{.mark} as important to Norway and Russia as it is to China
or Canada]{.underline}. New investments abound: the Shell Ocean
Discovery XPRIZE to "Accelerate Technology Breakthroughs for Rapid and
Unmanned Ocean Exploration"; DARPA's POSYDON communications and
navigational system for the deep ocean; China's new fleet of
nuclear-powered icebreakers; Equinor's competition to develop artificial
intelligence and machine learning technologies for iceberg detection
(the chapter by Vidar Hepsø and Elena Parmiggiani explores these trends
in relation to computational sensing technologies and simulated models,
both of which are capable of translating the complexity of the
environment into measurable indicators). [**[This infrastructural boom
has helped construct a vast and growing constellation of]{.mark}
satellites, drones, buoys, cables, supercomputers, servers, and sensors,
a [commercially oriented cognitive apparatus for charting the New

[The sixteen cases reveal four [significant tendencies surrounding
green]{.mark} extractivisms and [climate colonialities in the
Arctic]{.mark} (Figure 2). The first is a positive solution framing of
new Arctic extraction by its proponents, [in]{.mark} which
[discourses]{.mark}, [promotions]{.mark}, technological
[innovation]{.mark}, as well as [support from nation states and]{.mark}
multinational [companies]{.mark}, are [performed in an environmentally
responsible manner]{.mark}.]{.underline} This includes greening the full
supply chain including raw material extraction, processing and
production, waste management, transport, and distribution (Garbis et
al., 2023). The trend also involves specific references to the Nordic
context, where oil and mining activities have (supposedly) always been
committed to environmental and socioeconomic improvements (Egerman et
al., 2003).

In Russia, greening the supply chain is associated with the
modernization of industrial (Soviet) facilities, which would allow for
further development of emerging energy transition materials, LNG and
nuclear power utility in the supply chain, and overall global trade
(Venovcevs, 2021; Wu et al., 2021). In the Canadian and Hanaček et al.
Green and climate colonialities: Evidence of Arctic extractivisms
Journal of Political Ecology Vol. 31, 2024 550 the US parts of the
Arctic, the need for additional infrastructure or expansion of existing
mines (copper, iron) are justified and promoted because of the growing
demand for energy transition metals and infrastructure. [In Greenland,
uranium and rare earths, both of which are radioactive, are [promoted as
helpful for combating climate change and]{.mark} for
[independence]{.mark}.]{.underline} These findings are in line with the
work of Össbo (2023), who proposes that [[green colonialism
blends]{.mark} past [expropriation]{.mark} [with contemporary
deprivation]{.mark}. Historically contested energy and mining projects
have previously been discussed as part of the contemporary green
transition and \"sacrifice zones\" in the Arctic. We connect [such
processes]{.mark} to [the]{.mark} climate [emergency affecting Arctic
peoples]{.mark}.]{.underline} The region\'s extractivism-based
development has resulted in a scenario in which the interests of the
fuel, mining, and now green energy complexes are framed as \"required\"
to deliver a \"solution\" to climate change (Dorn et al., 2022;
Gelderloos, 2022; Voskoboynik & Andreucci, 2022). Arctic Indigenous
peoples regard climate change problems and solutions to it as a
continuation of colonialism, with strong ties between capitalism and
extractivisms\' past and current acts (Callison, 2014; Whyte, 2017).

The second tendency is that Arctic socio-environmental and atmospheric
violence becoming inextricably linked (DeBoom, 2022; Hughes et al.,
2023), forming colonial atmospheres through a variety of political,
social, economic, and environmental means (Mahony & Endfield, 2018;
Osborne & Carlson, 2023). In this (neo)colonial climate-led resource
frontier expansion, non- and anti-extractivist forms of knowledge and
ways of being are systemically ignored (Kröger, 2022), and serve as a
foundation for global green extractivism, increased energy use, and the
destruction of human and other-than-human nature (Sheller, 2023;
Sultana, 2022). We came across several Arctic \"sacrifice zones\" that
can be compared to other studies explaining climateinduced crises of
green accumulation and hegemonic profiteering in colonized countries and
regions (Andreucci et al., 2023; DeBoom, 2022; Dunlap, 2023). Here,
epistemic, ontological, infrastructural, and atmospheric violence are
central to colonial-extractivism(s).

The third tendency is the increased harm done to Arctic Indigenous
Peoples\' territory, cultures, knowledge, practices, health, and
lifeways (Figure 3 a). Fifteen out of the sixteen cases reported these
life and death concerns (Batalla, 2020; Kuokkanen, 2023). The Sámi,
Iupiat, Nenets, Doglan, Evenki, Dena, Entsy, Inuvialuit, and Nganasan
are Indigenous communities actively resisting them (Figure 3 b). Their
primary concern is the loss of reindeer herding or caribou migration and
survival, along with their knowledge, practices, landscapes, sacred
sites, and overall human-nature relationships. This cultural revival
throughout the examples analyzed reveals that reindeer herding is
essential to Sámi and Nenets culture. Normann (2021) explains that
[[shared memories]{.mark}, [interactions with other communities]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} collective [activities are effective modes of mobilization
against green colonialism, which continue to damage]{.mark} reindeer
herders and other [Arctic peoples]{.mark}. Thus, the continuation of
historical extractivist colonial pressures intensifies through the green
shift, territorial invasion, and socio-cultural and environmental
erasure (Clark, 2021; Kuokkanen, 2023).]{.underline} Access to hunting,
fishing, whaling, and sealing is also a source of contention. As
Inuvialuit hunters and community members of Baffin Island stated
\'\'\[...it is\] our right to eat, and our right to continue to live off
the land as we choose, as we have always done\'\' (Bennett, 2021). Yet,
the long history of anti-mining and anti-oil struggles has had a
significant influence on both the physical, the emotional, and mental
wellbeing of the Arctic peoples (Bjørst et al., 2022). Extractivisms
cause emotional anguish to locals by turning highly political issues
into apolitical and technical questions (ibid). Corporate-state nexuses
also try to dissuade people from radical resistance, but instead to
express their views by colonial and often Eurocentric forms of private
negotiation, participating in certification, stakeholder dialogue and
other non-contentious politics, such as sustainable mining roundtables
or even state consultation and corporate dialogue in green colonial
contexts (Fjellheim, 2023). Dunlap & Riquito (2023) discuss in depth the
psycho-social damage that the pro-mining corporate-government nexuses
contribute to in green extractivism attempts, such as lithium mining.

\[Image omitted\]

The fourth tendency is rising resistance to Arctic extractivisms.
Impacts of climate change have long influenced mobilization of
socio-environmental conflicts across the Arctic (Balzer, 2015; Fedorova
& Mitryaykina, 2021; Magomedov, 2019). [In fact, the links between land
and nature, livelihoods, and survival and resistance are all intertwined
with Arctic climate challenges. Concerns over water, land, culture,
hazardous waste, and climate change have surfaced as key elements in the
anti-colonial efforts in the Arctic (Figure 2). In the [Arctic]{.mark},
the [resistance revolves around]{.mark} historical and [green]{.mark}
extractivisms [in particular]{.mark}. This is because green
extractivisms [perpetuate climate colonialities and establish an
uninterrupted axis of false climate solutions]{.mark}]{.underline},
exacerbating an already worrisome situation on Arctic changing
territories and climates. Increasingly, anticolonial movements, in the
broad sense, reshape extractivist trajectories. Opposition does this by
similar strategies to those used in other contexts, including for
example collective resistance, media activism, and blockade actions
against extractive colonialities that devastate the people and the Earth
(Dunlap & Jakobsen, 2020; Kröger, 2020).

\[Image omitted\]

Finally, we also observed non-Indigenous dimensions, but these were so
limited that they cannot be called a tendency (Figure 2). Lassila (2020)
previously reported on non-Indigenous dimensions in green mining
disputes (i.e., the Sakatti project in Sodankylä, Finland) with
ramifications for Finnish reindeer herders and disagreement over the
mine\'s proximity to a conservation area. Although an important factor
for better understanding of how green extractivism develops and the
forms it takes across the region, we do not observe such a pattern in
our dataset. The cases we observed included disagreements by
non-Indigenous people over seabed mining and potentially hazardous waste
leaking into the ocean between mining and large-scale fishing
industries. Scientists, international, and national environmental
justice organisations (EJOs) typically mobilise in such situations
(Figure 3 a). Instead of forming their own resistance to extractivism,
these actors typically offer support for Indigenous struggles.

6\. Conclusion

This article analyzed sixteen Arctic historical and contemporary
\'\'green\'\' and \'\'brown\'\' extractivist cases identified in the
Global Atlas of Environmental Justice, and existing literature. The
results have important implications for addressing the
climate-ecological crisis and the proposed response through (green)
extractivisms. [We found that climate colonialities and extractivisms
closely intertwine, in multiple ways and over history. Green extractive
tendencies in the Arctic region are closely tied to ongoing colonial
legacies. These extractivism-based colonialisms, [whether]{.mark} from
[East or West, internal or external]{.mark}, [\'\'green\'\']{.mark} [or
conventional]{.mark}, can [result in the expansion of oppressive
necropolitical systems]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Climate change has been globally caused by the historical exploitation
of resources, peoples, and cultures, which are core elements of colonial
relations in the Arctic and elsewhere (DeBoom, 2022; Sultana, 2022;
Whyte, 2017). Especially in fragile and rapidly changing Arctic
environments, where climatic-ecological disruptions are making
extraction more difficult but also opening up new areas and resources as
ice recedes, green extractivisms are increasingly portrayed as
opportunities to solve this global problem (Kröger, 2023). These
green-labeled processes can barely be separated from historical fossil
fuel, natural gas, or hydropower related extractivisms (Dunlap, 2021).
Actually, they are exacerbating crises, while simultaneously being
challenged by them. Extraction is still expanding in the Arctic.

[[Greening]{.mark} destructive mining and similar industries [throughout
Indigenous and non-Indigenous Arctic homelands cannot conceal the
effects of climate change]{.mark}, extractivisms, [and the roll-out of
infrastructure]{.mark}. [While old and new]{.mark} transition metal
[mining]{.mark}, [wastes]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} toxic [dusts are the
\'\'new green\'\' along with infrastructure projects]{.mark}
(Barbesgaard & Whitmore, 2022), [peoples across the]{.mark} Circumpolar
[North challenge and oppose the]{.mark} interconnected axes of green
[extractive practices and climate change impacts]{.mark} (Batalla, 2020;
Clark, 2021; Truscello, 2020).]{.underline}

[[Colonial legacies]{.mark} involved [in]{.mark} extractivism and
[**climate issues continue to be a barrier to selfdetermination, as well
as ontological, epistemological**]{.mark} and axiological **[elements of
the struggle]{.mark}**, including recognition of the knowledge systems
and values of many Arctic Peoples]{.underline} (Fjellheim, 2023;
Lassila, 2018; Watson & Huntington, 2008). Through opposition, colonial
ties in climate change and green extractive solutions can be challenged:
as can state-corporate control over Arctic territories through
technological-industrial greening in the climate emergency (Dunlap &
Jakobsen, 2020; Fjellheim, 2022; Magomedov, 2019; Osborne & Carlson,
2023; Zografos, 2022).

[The earth has provided a relatively stable environment that promoted
the development of human civilization over the past 11,000 years. But
today, [humanity is pushing past]{.mark} important planetary
[boundaries]{.mark}, and by so doing is threatening to undermine its own
environmental foundations]{.underline} (Steffen et al. 2015). Scientists
have published increasingly dire warnings about our environmental
predicament, but contemporary societies seem unable to adequately
respond and change course. Allan Schnaiberg (1980) developed the
treadmill of production model in order to explain this state of affairs.
Capitalism, according to this theory, is premised on an ever-growing
expansion in the production of goods and services (Schnaiberg 1980;
Gould, Pellow, and Schnaiberg 2008). Because the production of an
increasing amount of goods and services requires the increasing use of
energy and natural resources, along with an increasing amount of waste
and pollution, expanding economies produce increasing amounts of
environmental degradation. According to treadmill theorists, it is very
difficult, if not impossible, to step off the treadmill and onto a
stable-state economy because the profitability of corporations, revenue
for governments, and job opportunities for labor are all linked to
increasing economic growth (Schnaiberg 1980; Gould, Pellow, and
Schnaiberg 2008). Empirical tests have strongly substantiated the tenets
of the treadmill of production model (Jorgenson and Clark 2009; York,
Rosa, and Dietz 2003).

Hooks and Smith (2004), however, recognized that not all kinds of
environmental degradation are caused by the expansionary logic of
capitalism. [They developed the treadmill of destruction model to
explain how militarism and geopolitical struggles negatively impact the
environment in ways that are distinct from the economy. While, they
write, '[the expansionary logic of capitalism is the explanatory
mechanism at the heart of the treadmill of production]{.mark}; [arms
races and geopolitical competition]{.mark} among states [play]{.mark} a
comparable role when considering [the]{.mark} environmental [danger
posed by militarism']{.mark}]{.underline} (Hooks and Smith 2004, 561).
As governments compete with one another for territory and power, they
invest evergreater amounts of capital into increasingly destructive
weaponry. Producing this weaponry, testing it, mobilizing it around the
globe, and ultimately using it requires tremendous amounts of natural
resources and leaves a legacy of toxic contamination (Frey 2013; Hooks
and Smith 2004; Jorgenson and Clark 2015; Smith, Hooks, and Lengefeld
2014). Research evidence has borne out the tenets of the treadmill of
destruction model by demonstrating that rates of militarism have their
own independent effect on the environment, apart from that of the
treadmill of production (Hooks and Smith 2004; Jorgenson and Clark
2009).

Researchers have made a strong case that the treadmills of production
and destruction are both important drivers of environmental decline, and
that the two are distinct and irreducible logics; one cannot be
explained solely in terms of the other. Certainly, however, the logics
of capitalism and militarism are often complementary (Jorgenson and
Clark 2009). David Harvey (2005) argued as much, theorizing that they
are intertwined logics of power that are distinct and potentially
contradictory, but that they also potentially enhance one another.
Understanding degrees of overlap between these logics is, however, a
difficult task. One potential path forward is to undertake
power-structure analyses (see Domhoff 2010) of military and economic
organizations in order to understand the kinds of goals they have set
for themselves and the strategies they have developed in order to
achieve them. As Downey and Strife (2010) wrote, such an organizational
analysis is not meant to supplant the treadmill models, but is instead
needed as a complementary form of research in light of the tremendous
complexity of the social world. The particular ways that the logics of
capitalism and militarism unfold are, after all, variable and contingent
upon a number of historical factors.

Domhoff (2010) argued that the U.S. government does not automatically
privilege capital accumulation over other potential state objectives.
Rather, this is something that members of the American upper class
actively work to achieve. According to Domhoff (2010), the wealthiest
beneficiaries of U.S. capitalism are organized in a network -- through
shared membership on corporate, think tank, and other non-profit boards
-- into what can be called a corporate community. This network mobilizes
resources in order to achieve government policy goals that will benefit
the corporate wealthy as a whole, without privileging any particular
economic sector (Domhoff 2010).

The corporate community does not only seek to influence domestic policy,
but U.S. foreign policy as well (Shoup 2015). This is not a surprise to
many environmental sociologists, who have long held that [U.S.
[capitalism is dependent upon violence]{.mark} in order [ensure]{.mark}
the low[-cost access to natural resources]{.mark} upon which it
depends]{.underline} (Downey, Bonds, and Clark 2010; Gedicks 2001; Gould
2007). Given this dependence, it is easy to understand why the
wealthiest Americans have, as a whole, supported a robust U.S. military
presence across the Western Hemisphere since its early days as a nation,
and why they now advocate for U.S. military dominance across the globe
(Pellow 2015).

[But, [just as capitalists often depend upon military power,]{.mark}
[contemporary militaries]{.mark} are also [dependent upon capital
accumulation]{.mark}]{.underline} (Wallerstein 2004). There is a growing
cost, after all, to expansionary military policies. While these costs
can be paid for by increasing tax rates, this is also a recipe for
domestic unrest. But, growing economies can make paying for the
increasing costs of militarism easier to bear. It is for this reason
that historical sociologists like Wallerstein (2004) and Arrighi (2010)
argued that military and economic dominance are closely bound, and that,
as the economic supremacy of a nation wanes, so too its military power
diminishes. [So, while the [U.S. military]{.mark} certainly, as an
institution, seeks to influence government policy to ensure its own
growth (Mills 1956, Scheer 2008), its [officials]{.mark} also [depend
upon an everexpanding economy]{.mark}.]{.underline}

ns' (1987) apt phrase, states are 'containers of power' in that they set
and enforce rules within particular territories while also projecting
power outward to jockey with other nations. Both the corporate community
and military institutions seek to influence how and when that power will
be used. Domhoff (2010) argued that it is an open question whether
capitalists, military officials, or elites in some other organization --
such as religious institutions -- hold the most sway in any particular
society. But, in the case of the U.S., the corporate community is most
influential. Even so, both the corporate community and the military make
a difference in terms of determining U.S. policy, and both depend on --
and plan for -- the other. This mutual dependence and overlap between
the corporate community goes far beyond the 'military-industrial
complex,' or the interconnected network of military branches and
arms-producing companies (see Hooks and Smith 2004; Gould 2007).
[Rather, [the U.S. corporate]{.mark} community is, [as a whole]{.mark},
[dependent upon the global projection of U.S. military power]{.mark},
just as the U.S. military relies upon continued capital accumulation, as
**will be [shown in]{.mark} an analysis of corporate-connected think
tank and [military strategy planning documents for the Arctic]{.mark}**.
But, before moving on to this analysis, it is important to first
consider the role of think tanks in U.S. society.]{.underline}

#### Deep Sea Mining is the new frontier for capitalism

**Young '25** \[Stanton; June 17; Author for the RCA; RCA; "Global
Scramble for Rare Earth Minerals Intensifies";
https://communistusa.org/global-scramble-for-rare-earth-minerals-intensifies/\]

In his famous work Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism, Lenin
wrote:

Finance [[capital is interested not only in]{.mark} the [already
discovered]{.mark} sources of [raw materials but also]{.mark} in
[potential sources]{.mark}]{.underline}, because present-day technical
development is extremely rapid ... This also applies to [[prospecting
for]{.mark} minerals]{.underline}, to [new methods of [processing up and
utilizing raw materials]{.mark}]{.underline}, etc., etc. [[Hence, the
inevitable striving of finance capital to **enlarge its spheres of
influence**]{.underline}]{.mark} and even its actual territory.

The potential exists for workers to plan and create a world of
automation and superabundance. But [[so long as capitalism exists, the
imperialist vultures can only offer barbarism, war, and environmental
destruction in their relentless quest for profits.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The future of technology hinges on dozens of minerals that are essential
for everything from smartphones to weapons. AI data centers alone could
require 200,000 metric tons of copper annually between 2025 and 2028.
91% of US Navy systems and 78% of Department of Defense weapons depend
on critical elements like antimony, gallium, germanium, tungsten, and
tellurium.

The potential profits are enormous. Copper hit a record high of \$11,000
per metric ton in 2024. Pentagon mineral contracts have grown 23% a year
since 2010. The capitalists are salivating over the spoils, and it's no
surprise these minerals play a central role in the US-China trade war.

US imperialism playing catch up

After "Liberation Day," China restricted exports of seven rare earth
elements (REEs) which are vital for manufacturing advanced weapons. This
shook the American military establishment, which is waking up to just
how dominant China is in mineral production. A Department of Defense
study recently identified \$2.41 billion in mineral shortfalls for 69
defense materials and \$12 billion more for civilian production.

China mines 70% of REEs and has 91% of global refining capacity. In
contrast, the US is totally dependent on imports for 12 of 50 critical
minerals and over 50% reliant for another 29. China is the world's top
producer for 29 of these.

A 30% reduction in gallium supply could cost the US \$602 billion---2.2%
of GDP. The US imported 100% of its graphite in 2022, with nearly a
third coming from China, and the Pentagon classifies 88% of its critical
mineral supply chains as "exposed to Chinese influence."

In search of cheap labor and higher profits, American capitalists have
hollowed out the country's industrial capability. For example, the US
led the world in zinc processing in the 1950s. Now it produces just 6%,
while China produces 33%. America was once the top uranium producer. Now
it imports its entire supply, including some from Russia.

Flashpoints in the global mineral war

The [US]{.mark} imperialists are [[desperate to reassert
control]{.underline}]{.mark}---and mineral-rich nations are in the
crosshairs. [For example, they [cut a mineral deal with Ukraine]{.mark}
on April 30]{.underline}, which holds 117 of the 120 most-used
industrial minerals. However, most are located in territory claimed and
occupied by Russia.

[The Trump administration dangled the promise of [more weapons and money
for]{.mark} Ukraine's]{.underline} hopelessly doomed [war effort and
secured a deal giving US corporations [50% of future Ukrainian
mining]{.mark} [revenue]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other words, the
imperialists are [prolonging the senseless slaughter in the mere hope of
paydirt]{.underline}.

[[Other]{.mark} hot spots [include Greenland and Canada]{.mark}---which
explains Trump's mania for annexing Greenland and making Canada the 51st
state]{.underline}. Both hold massive REE deposits, and Canada is the
second-largest uranium producer. Kazakhstan, the world's largest uranium
supplier, mainly exports to Russia and China.

For 29 years, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has been gripped by
a never-ending cycle of violence, instability, and plunder---largely
driven by imperialism's insatiable thirst for the country's rich mineral
deposits. In April, Washington announced a phony imperialist "peace"
deal between DRC and Rwanda which will, at best, result in a brief pause
before the bloodshed resumes.

That same month[, [Trump]{.mark} signed an [executive order encouraging
deep sea mining]{.mark}, and [conflict over]{.mark} [undersea mineral
claims]{.mark} may [erupt]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the Center for
Strategic and International Studies noted, "The race to mine the deep
sea is on, and conflict in international waters over disputed resources
is likely on the horizon."

Absolutely none of this is a sure thing for American imperialism. Such
[[projects require huge amounts of capital investment and often involve
building new mines from scratch]{.underline}]{.mark} in regions where
mineral wealth is only "estimated" and unconfirmed. In Greenland, harsh
weather and icy surfaces add to the challenges. As for the US, it takes
an average of 29 years to build a mine.

While China dominates refining, it still imports raw materials from
Australia, India, Thailand, the DRC, and Myanmar. Myanmar, like the DRC,
has been plagued by civil war---in part because of imperialist
competition over minerals. In Myanmar, China supports both the military
dictatorship and several competing guerrilla groups in order to ensure
its access to minerals.

[[The decline of the US relative to China is a fact, but the US
imperialists will do their damndest to stay on top---no matter the cost
to humanity.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Fight imperialism with socialist revolution

It comes as no surprise that [[environmental sustainability doesn't
figure in the]{.mark} imperialists' [calculations]{.mark}]{.underline}.
This is the [[hypocrisy behind the "green" energy
transition]{.underline}]{.mark}. A decade ago, tech billionaires were
hailed as climate saviors. But the technologies they rely on depend on
environmentally destructive extraction processes.

Take Canada's Ring of Fire, a pristine swamp and forest serving as a
vital carbon sink. Beneath it lie \$67 billion in rare earth minerals.
The capitalists are plotting to dig it up, releasing untold amounts of
carbon and methane into the atmosphere.

[[Environmental destruction, worldwide bloodletting, and economic
instability are not isolated problems. They are **products of the
capitalist system**]{.underline}]{.mark}---a system that puts entire
nations in the crosshairs of imperialist predators. The [solution is not
to pick sides]{.underline} between rival imperialists, [but to [fight
for a socialist future]{.mark}]{.underline}---in which the world's
resources are democratically planned and controlled by the working class
in the interests of humanity and the planet.

E. Alaska's Potential Mineral Wealth

Like other states, [the [**U**nited **S**tates should **look** to
**offshore sources** to]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}see whether it can
**[[address]{.underline}]{.mark}** some of [[the **demand** for
**strategic minerals**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [**Alaska** could be
the **key element**]{.underline} of such an approach. [Legacy
**legislation** and **guidelines** already **exist** for obtaining hard
minerals located on the **continental shelf**]{.underline}.152 Today,
**[[Alaska]{.underline}]{.mark}** mainly produces gold, lead, sand and
gravel (construction), silver, and zinc, but the [[**future** could
include]{.underline}]{.mark} higher-value [[**offshore** **hard
minerals**]{.underline}]{.mark}.153 The nonfuel mineral economy of
Alaska is ranked sixth in the United States.154

[[**Alaska's** **offshore seabed**]{.underline}]{.mark} contains areas
that are [conducive to **mineral formation**]{.underline}. **[Melting
ice]{.underline}** cover [[makes]{.underline}]{.mark} potential
[[**mineral extraction** more **feasible**]{.underline}]{.mark}.155
Alaska's continental shelf has extensional basins formed by an active
subduction zone that may contain seafloor massive sulfide deposits, deep
abyssal plains that could contain seabed nodules, and seamounts that may
contain ferromanganese crusts.156 [The [**Alaskan ECS** has the
potential for **seabed minerals**]{.mark} throughout the **Canada

[the **Aleutian Islands**, although **data** are

present]{.underline} along seamounts [in the **Gulf of Alaska** and the
**Chukchi Borderland** due north of Alaska in the Arctic
Ocean]{.underline}.158

[[**Alaska** could become a **reservoir** of the **critical minerals**
needed for U.S. **economic**]{.mark} and **national
[security]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The Energy Act of 2020 defines
"critical minerals" as those designated by the Secretary of the Interior
that are:

minerals, elements, substances, and materials . . . that . . . (i) are
essential to the economic or national security of the United States;
(ii) the supply chain of which is vulnerable to disruption . . . ; and
(iii) serve an essential function in the manufacturing of a product, . .
. the absence of which would have significant consequences for our
economy or our national security.159

CONCLUSION

[[As the largest part of the **U.S**]{.mark}**. [continental
shelf]{.mark}**[, **Alaska's offshore** area]{.mark}]{.underline}, which
has many favorable geomorphological characteristics, [[may one day be an
important and secure source of **strategic

However, [[**extractivism** has **flaws** as a **long-term strategy**
for **capital accumulation**]{.mark}. [Commodity production]{.mark} by
itself [does not drive the system forward]{.mark}]{.underline}. Value is
substantiated in commodity products during the labour process. [Oil,
minerals, palm and soybean oil all have a use-value]{.underline} (albeit
often quite limited) and exchange-value. The exchange-value is [only
realised when these commodities are sold, and this is typically so that
they can be **uti**lised in production processe]{.underline}s[. [It is
the rhythm of **boom and bust** within capitalism]{.mark} and the
system['s]{.mark} longer-term [tendencies towards **crisis** that
dictate]{.mark} the pace of accumulation]{.underline}, rather than the
presence or absence of primary products extracted though mining or
agribusiness. [The **crash in oil prices** following the coronavirus
pandemic is proof of this]{.underline}. The economic activity slump
triggered by Covid-19 means that oil is suddenly in surplus and almost
worthless in price. Millions of barrels remain unwanted in storage
tanks. Thus although [there may be a **"new extractivism"** that is
empirically discernible,]{.underline} this does not necessarily mean
that we have entered a new phase of capital accumulation. [Extractivism
is not a novel stage of [capitalism]{.mark} but a reflection of the
limitations and contradictions of the existing one. Extractivism is
integral to global capitalist accumulation today, but it must be
understood within the dynamics of the wider system.]{.underline}

The [current slowdown in China]{.underline}---the world's largest
trading nation since 2013---is [a key indicator of the **[future
direction]{.mark}** of the world economy.]{.underline} In the
pre-Covid-19 world much of the boom [**[in extractivism]{.mark}** was [a
**direct product** of the **growth** of the economy in China]{.mark},
which needed to [hoover up **natural resources** (and block competitor
states' access to them)]{.mark} as its manufacturing economy
grew]{.underline}. China [specialises in **processing** and
**re-processing** manufactured goods.]{.underline} Primary products and
manufactured parts are assembled to meet the demands of increasing
domestic consumption and for the export market, so the pulse of the
Chinese economy both reflects and partially determines the heartbeat of
the wider global economy. China's [[**energy consumption** more than
doubled]{.underline}]{.mark} between 1980 and 2000 and then doubled
again by 2015, [[reflecting]{.mark} its growing **[economic
importance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is the major world importer of
primary commodities, and demand from China spins backwards and forwards
along the commodity supply chain. Its major imports in 2019 included
\$57.1 billion of iron ore, \$53.2 billion of copper and copper ore and
\$116 billion of oil and other mineral products. It was responsible for
just over 17 percent of global crude oil imports and also imported
\$38.3 billion worth of oil seeds.74 It is a major importer of timber,
both sawn and unsawn, primarily from South Asian countries such as
Malaysia.75 Latin America, Africa and Australia are major suppliers of
primary commodities to China. As we have seen[, China has major
investments in resource extraction within these continents and
regions]{.underline}. However, as Covid-19 and lockdown swept the
industrialised world between February and March 2020, the value of all
imports of primary products to China fell by more than half, sending a
massive shockwave through the world economy.76 If this downward trend is
sustained, then the overseas extraction-based economies on which China
depends will suffer enormously and the "extractive" model, of whatever
hue, will feel the strain.

[[Extractivism]{.mark} certainly has been [a strategy of choice]{.mark}
for individual nation states and corporations]{.underline}. We have
surveyed a number of the distinct shapes that this strategy takes
today[: the **["progressive extractivism"]{.mark}** with a "compensatory
state" [in Latin America, **"resource nationalism"** in]{.mark} Southern
[Africa]{.mark}, the [straightforward neoliberal extractivism]{.mark} of
the Maghreb and the **"predatory capitalism"** of Bolsonaro's
Brazil.]{.underline} All [these strategies [seek survival within a
global economy based on]{.mark} **free trade** and
[**commodification**.]{.mark}]{.underline} ["**Export or
die"**]{.underline} is the mantra. [Land-grabbing, enrichment of elites
at the expense of the poor and the suppression of indigenous people are
the results]{.underline}. The [[search for **exploitable
resources**]{.underline}]{.mark} has also [[created new geopolitical
tensions]{.mark} between the major powers, [such as the battles for
rights to **deep-sea mining** in]{.mark} the world's [ocean]{.mark}s
[and the **military build-up** in the **Arctic
Circle.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

The new [[extractivism]{.mark} has also [become a **litmus test**
for]{.mark} the fight against **[ecological catastrophe]{.mark}**. [The
planet]{.mark}'s **soil**, **air** and **water** are [being destroyed by
capitalism's **commodification of nature**. **Deforestation**, **species
extinction** and **degradation of the** ]{.mark}**soil** and
**[sea]{.mark}s** all [go **hand in hand** with]{.mark} the [search
for]{.mark} more **fossil fuels**, [**rare minerals** and
**profits**]{.mark} from monoculture farming.]{.underline}

New [prospects for **class struggles** will emerge from this
situation]{.underline} and the tensions placed upon it by today's
economic crisis. Without profits from extraction, the states of Latin
America, for example, may once again be plunged into debt crises. [The
urban working class will be pushed even further into **confrontation**
with ruling elites, who will wish to make workers pay the price for a
failing strategy]{.underline}. If workers' resistance and rebellion to
austerity coalesce with the struggle against climate chaos, then a new
world may be possible to win.

The [[**global economy** is **changing**]{.underline}]{.mark}.1
[[After]{.underline}]{.mark} the financial crash of
[20**[08]{.underline}**, **[world trade declined]{.underline}**
]{.mark}[and has been [outpaced by sluggish growth]{.mark} in **global
production**.]{.underline} The Covid-19 crisis and a fall in commodity
prices in [March 2020 has since driven the world economy into a
slump]{.underline} that is likely to be more damaging than the Great
Recession just over a decade ago. Within this changing scene, [[debates
have arisen about the **growth of extractivism**]{.mark}---the
**[mining]{.mark}** and **extraction of metals**, minerals [and]{.mark}
oil from the earth]{.underline}---and the growth of agribusiness, which
produces food as a traded commodity[. The [**expropriation** of nature
is **intrinsic to capitalism**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which as Marx
suggested is driven by profit to rob the soil as well the worker.2
[There is an [**obvious link** between **climate change** and investment
in **extraction**]{.mark} of fossil fuels [through
]{.mark}]{.underline}fracking, **[[deep-sea
mining]{.underline}]{.mark}**, coal mining, oil and gas [drilling, and
exploitation of tar sands. The hypocrisy of our ruling elites is clear.
[Much favoured for plunder have been]{.mark} the [**rare earths**,
**metals** and **minerals**]{.mark} that feed the digital technology
attached to smart phones and computers]{.underline}. Alongside this,
intensive and industrialised forms of agribusiness and
monoculture---most notably production of grain for food and animal feed,
and palm oil for biofuels---have also encouraged states and corporations
to engage in land-grabbing, [often [in the teeth of opposition
from]{.mark} local and [indigenous people]{.mark}. New and sometimes
violent struggles have been the result.]{.underline}

Given these trends many [academic and political
[commentators]{.mark}]{.underline} are [[suggesting
that]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[world economy has now
entered]{.underline}]{.mark} a new era of [[**extraction-based
accumulation**]{.mark} that is [reminiscent of]{.mark} earlier [colonial
times]{.mark}.]{.underline} This article [addresses these debates by
examining]{.underline} trends in global production, trade and investment
and their role in the [expansion of mining]{.underline}, monoculture and
land-grabs. I [compare earlier forms of colonial or "settler" extraction
with the extractivist strategies of **present-day states** and assess
the significance of these transformations for understanding contemporary
capitalism.]{.underline}

Extractivism, old and new: from primitive accumulation to neoliberalism

[[Capitalism's propensity to **exploit** and **commodify** the natural
world is nothing new]{.underline}.]{.mark} It was central to the
"primitive accumulation" of capital described by Marx. [**Capitalism's
birth** was [bound up with]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}European
colonial expansion, [[**plunder** of **foreign lands**]{.underline}
]{.mark}and land-grabbing from indigenous people. It is worth quoting
Marx at length here. He describes how the shift from the feudal mode of
production to the capitalist one was achieved through force and drenched
in blood:

[The [**discovery of gold** and **silver** in America]{.mark}, the
extirpation, **[enslavement]{.mark}** and entombment in **mines** of the
aboriginal population, the beginning of the]{.underline} conquest and
**[[looting of India]{.underline}]{.mark}** and the turning of Africa
into a warren for the commercial hunting of black skins [[signaled the
**rosy dawn** of the era of **capitalist
production**]{.mark}.]{.underline} These idyllic proceedings are the
[chief [moments of **primitive accumulation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. On
their heels treads the commercial war of the European nations, with the
globe as its battleground. It begins with the revolt of the Netherlands
from Spain, assumes giant dimensions in England's anti-Jacobin war and
is still going on in the opium wars against China.

The [different moments of primitive accumulation can be assigned in
particular to Spain, Portugal, Holland, France and England,]{.underline}
more or less in chronological order. In England at the end of the 17th
century, they [arrive at a systematical combination]{.underline},
embracing the colonies, the national debt, the modern mode of taxation
and the protectionist system. [These methods depend in part on brute
force, for example, the colonial system]{.underline}. [But, they all
employ the power of the state,]{.underline} the concentrated and
organized force of society, to hasten, hot-house fashion, the process of
transformation of the feudal mode of production into the capitalist
mode, and to shorten the transition. Force is the midwife of every old
society pregnant with a new one. It is itself an economic power.3

The [[rush to **monopolise** **natural resources** was integral to the
**commodification** of the **natural world**.]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**Primary products** became the **fuel** for the process of
**production**, whether coal for steam power, oil for motor vehicles and
aeroplanes or lithium for today's batteries]{.underline}.4 In many
cases, colonised societies were restructured by the imperial powers as
sources of primary commodities[, blocking the possibility of independent
industrial development.]{.underline} The transport infrastructures of
conquered nations were designed to extract raw materials from the
interior to ports so that they could be shipped to the metropoles to be
processed. The prior economic development of these societies was
reversed when they were flooded with cheap industrial products from
Europe.

[[Capitalism's **inherent dynamic** of **competition**]{.mark} and
**ever-expanding cycle** of **accumulation** meant a search for, and
plunder of, whatever **primary products** could be mined, farmed or
fished.]{.underline} The bonds between humans and nature that are
essential to our existence---what Engels referred to as the "metabolic
interchange"---was put under enormous strain by capitalism and a great
"metabolic rift" with nature has followed.5 The breakdown of the
relationship between humans and the natural world remains a consistent
theme as we pass from old to new forms of extractivism.

[The consolidation of the power of capital on all continents throughout
the 18th and 19th centuries led to a huge expansion of world trade in
**primary commodities** and **manufactured goods**]{.underline}---a
first wave of "globalisation". However, [this process fell back as rival
imperialisms fought out their differences in the First World
War]{.underline}. Britain was the dominant power during this first wave
due to its early industrialisation.

Called [the Great Acceleration]{.underline}, the speed-up is driving
what Earth System scientists describe as "the most rapid transformation
of the human relationship with the natural world in the history of
humankind."1 It [marks the beginning of a new historical and geological
epoch,]{.underline} the Anthropocene-a time when "human activities have
become so pervasive and profound that they rival the great forces of
nature and are pushing the Earth into planetary terra incognita."2

Long ago, Marx and Engels showed that capitalism can never stand still
or rest content in one place. In obedience to its first
commandment-Accumulate, accumulate!-"it must nestle everywhere, settle
everywhere, establish connections everywhere."3 So it is not surprising
that the trends identified in great acceleration research haven't just
continued, they have continued to accelerate. Capital, never content
with expanding existing operations, constantly seeks new places and
resources to exploit.

[It is sometimes suggested that [because **capitalism** has **occupied**
the **whole world**]{.mark}, [there are no more frontiers]{.mark} and no
new sources of cheap resources-so peak appropriation has
passed]{.underline}, sending the system into terminal decline. [[Such
arguments misunderstand]{.mark} and underestimate [**the system's
compulsion** to find new sources of **profit.**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}As Marx wrote, [for capitalism, "[every limit appears as a
barrier to be overcome]{.mark}." It always strives "to tear down every
spatial barrier... and conquer the whole earth]{.underline}."4

The world's continents and islands may be fully occupied, but [71% of
the planet is still mostly unexplored and underexploited.]{.underline} A
new study by scientists associated with the Stockholm Resilience Centre
shows that [[capitalism is now assaulting a **new
frontier**]{.mark}---on, in, and under **[water]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

**[[Blue Acceleration]{.underline}]{.mark}**

"The Blue Acceleration: [The [Trajectory of **Human Expansion** into the
Ocean]{.mark}]{.underline}," published in January in the journal One
Earth, describes and graphs capital's growing drive to industrialize the
oceans and sea beds. Commercial activity in the oceans is expanding
rapidly, and "considerable investments ... are driving growth in
existing industries and the emergence of new ones, spanning an
increasingly diverse range of activities."5

The authors believe that the [[blue acceleration marks the beginning of
"a new phase in humanity's relationship with the biosphere]{.mark},
where [the ocean is]{.mark} not only crucial for sustaining global
development trajectories but is [being fundamentally changed]{.mark} in
the process.]{.underline}"6

They illustrate that claim with 12 graphs that look much like the great
acceleration graphs, but with the hockey-stick upturns occurring five
decades later.

[**BLUE ACCELERATION**. Global trends i]{.underline}n (A) marine
aquaculture production; (B) [deep offshore hydrocarbon
production,]{.underline} including gas, crude oil, and natural gas
liquids below 125 m; (C[) total area of **seabed** under **mining
contract** in areas beyond **national jurisdiction**]{.underline}; (D)
cumulative contracted seawater desalination capacity; (E) accumulated
number of marine genetic sequences associated with a patent with
international protection; (F) accumulated number of casts added to the
World Ocean Database; (G) container port traffic measured in Twenty-Foot
Equivalent Units; (H) total length of submarine fiber optic cables; (I)
number of cruise passengers; (J) cumulative offshore wind energy
capacity installed; (K) total marine area protected; (L) total area of
claimed extended continental shelf.

\[graphs A through L omitted\]

The first two graphs are particularly powerful illustrations of efforts
to overcome limits by moving capital and production to previously
unexploited locations, and to obtain resources using new techniques and
technologies.

Graph A, Marine Aquaculture, shows the spectacular growth of fish
farming, which was inconsequential in 1970, but now accounts for nearly
50% of all fish eaten by humans. In the open ocean, wild fish catches
have been falling since the 1990s, but that decline has been more than
offset by aquaculture, mainly located in coastal areas. Total fish
production is larger than ever and fish processing is growing faster
than any other food industry.7

Aquaculture grew 10 a year in the late 20th century and is growing 58 a
year now UN Food and Agriculture Organization The State of the World
Fisheries and Aquaculture 2018 2

Aquaculture grew 10% a year in the late 20th century, and is growing
5.8% a year now. UN Food and Agriculture Organization, The State of the
World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2018, 2.

Graph B, Deep Hydrocarbons, shows oil and gas production from the deep
sea, which usually means more than 200 meters below the ocean surface.
Off-shore extraction already comprises 30% of worldwide oil production,
and "as shallow-water fields become depleted and novel technologies
emerge, production is moving towards greater depths and new territories,
including the Arctic where vast undiscovered oil and gas reserves are
expected." There is also growing industry interest in deposits of
natural gas hydrates (crystalized methane) buried kilometers below the
ocean floor, that "may represent twice as much organic carbon as the
world's coal, oil and other forms of natural gas combined." 8

Many of the blue acceleration trends involve new technology. A co-author
of the report points out that "the marine biotechnology sector scarcely
existed at the end of the 20th century, and over 99% of genetic
sequences from marine organisms found in patents were registered since
2000."9

More generally, as the One Earth article says, "[[the combination of
**increasing global demand**, **technological progress**, and declining
**land-based sources**]{.mark} have [made **extraction** of a growing
number of ocean materials]{.mark} not only feasible but **[economically
viable]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

[Costly endeavors such as [**commercial mining** of the **deep seabed**
are now considered]{.mark} not only feasible but
**[imminent]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Likewise, the search for novel
bioactive compounds to address antimicrobial resistance is increasingly
focused on remote deep-sea microorganisms, whereas space constraints on
land have contributed to the construction of large-scale offshore wind
farms and investment in deep-water installations....10

Today, [**offshore production** of oil and gas is by far the most
lucrative part of the ocean economy,]{.underline} while sand and gravel
for construction are the most-extracted offshore minerals, by volume.
Deep sea mining has yet to start, but the International Seabed Authority
has already issued 29 mineral and metal mining licenses covering 1.3
million square kilometers of ocean floor.11

\<MIC = Military industrial complex\>

[[**Militarism and capitalism** have been conjoined]{.mark}, in
symbiosis, [from at least]{.mark} the period of [the triangular
trade]{.mark} one-half millennia ago, when industrialization projects
around the globe trafficked in human bodies and the labor and armaments
of systemic control.]{.underline} [[The]{.mark}]{.underline} evolving
[[enmeshment of capitalist and military growth]{.mark},]{.underline} in
fact, [[generates]{.mark}]{.underline} a multitude of [intricate
[relationships]{.mark},]{.underline} where militarism avails its
considerable resources to suppress anticapitalist movements globally,
and [[where the m]{.mark}ilitary-[i]{.mark}ndustrial [c]{.mark}omplex
**[stabilizes capitalist]{.mark} [activity]{.mark}**, absorbing its
excesses [by producing **armaments**]{.mark}, **[surveillance]{.mark}**
tactics, [and]{.mark} ever-diversifying uses of **[security
tech]{.mark}nology**.]{.underline} Further, as capitalist activity
continues to seek new markets and forms of production, in concomitant
fashion, [[policies of human dispossession, dislocation, and
destruction]{.mark} inevitably [are]{.mark} [normalized]{.mark}. In the
United States]{.underline}, for example, [state]{.underline} and private
[enterprises approach]{.underline} these twined forces of [expansion and
destruction with the false yet clichéd appeal of spreading the "greater
goods" of capitalism and democracy]{.underline} through the War on
Terror. That is[, [deeper **conjunctions of militarism** and]{.mark}
[capitalism make the line]{.mark} between them [increasingly
indistinct]{.mark} and call for radical interventions to expose the
military-industrial complex's inner workings and impacts on the quality
of human life and on the viability of societies across the
globe.]{.underline} The editors of this issue and the scholars whose
work appears on its pages seek to demonstrate the critical need to
understand capitalist projects and military aggression by illuminating
their deep entanglements.

#### Military-focused development projects justify the capitalist exploitation of indigenous communities and dispossession of land. That turns case.

This issue also examines [[the centrality of militarism to]{.mark}
**capitalist [development]{.mark}** projects that [displace]{.mark}
indigenous and indigenous-identified [communities and disrupt
ecosystems]{.mark}]{.underline}: the worldviews, cultural practices[,
social [organizations, and econ]{.mark}omic [activities]{.mark} that
both [historically]{.mark} and presently [rely on]{.mark} the very same
natural resources brashly marked for [extraction]{.mark} by capital
investors]{.underline}. In her Interventions essay, Kalamaoka'aina Niheu
argues [that [this i]{.mark}ndustrial [pursuit]{.mark} of]{.underline}
natural resources and [geographies v[iolates]{.mark} indigenous [systems
of sustainability]{.mark}]{.underline}. Niheu writes as an indigenous
activist and scientist [on the front lines of [the struggle against
**militarization**, **settler** **colonialism**, and **climate
change**]{.mark} in Hawai'i. She details the economic, cosmological, and
physical violence that]{.underline} Kanaka Maoli, [the original people
of Hawai'i, have confronted as they have struggled against the
capitalist development that requires the ongoing illegal seizures of
their lands]{.underline}---from the establishment of the first sugar
plantations and military bases to more recent suburban housing
complexes. Yet mobilizations of labor and resources on behalf of
industrial developments also have created the contexts for Kanaka Maoli
and their allies to defeat technologies of extraction and colonial
violence on her home island of O'ahu. Her essay weaves together [[the
array of]{.mark} [problems]{.mark} and potential sites of resistance
[that]{.mark} the convergence of [militarism and capitalism
generate]{.mark}, [includ]{.mark}ing [climate change]{.mark}, the
propagation of [gun violence]{.mark}, and transnational alliances of
indigenous people against the resource extraction that threatens water
and life. In particular,]{.underline} the food sovereignty movement that
Niheu has engaged with for more than two decades has revitalized ancient
farming techniques, a process [that has depended on nonviolent direct
action to reclaim water rights and to take back the lands stolen by the
US government. T]{.underline}he lessons of nonviolent direction action,
she argues, were passed down from an earlier generation of activists who
helped birth the Hawaiian Renaissance in the 1970s[. [Niheu ends]{.mark}
[her essay with a]{.mark} powerful [call to build]{.mark} transborder
[alliances]{.mark} across the globe [among peoples who]{.mark} similarly
[struggle against militarism, colonialism, and state violence]{.mark}
and **[to recognize one's own complicity]{.mark}** in that
violence.]{.underline}

[[To maintain its]{.mark} economic [advantages, US cap]{.mark}italism
[leans on its military power]{.mark}]{.underline}. Other imperialist
countries do the same thing, but [[US imperialism]{.mark} still [makes
up 40% of]{.mark} all [arms spending]{.mark} around the world.
[Politicians]{.mark} on both sides of the aisle [agree]{.mark}
maintaining [US imperialism is a top priority]{.mark},]{.underline} as
we saw with the debt ceiling debate where the question of cutting
military spending didn't even enter the conversation. However, other
governments are also spending far more on weapons of war.

US imperialism has sent \$75 billion to Zelensky's regime in Ukraine.
This is more than France's entire military budget for a year. Only 5% of
this is used for humanitarian purposes. For a devastating contrast, it
would cost \$58 billion a year to make public college free in the US.

NATO is a military alliance that protects capitalism in Europe, and by
extension the US. To be a member a country is expected to spend 2% of
its GDP on military spending. In 2014, only two NATO countries hit this
target. Today seven countries do. NATO is encouraging countries to go
further. Poland is spending 4% of its GDP on military spending. This
spring, French President Emmanuel Macron called for a shift to a "war
economy." Germany is investing €100 billion into its military, a
significant shift from Germany's post-WWII low levels of military
investment, and permanently deploying a brigade in Estonia.

Japan is raising its military budget 60% over the next five years. South
Korea is raising its budget 40% over the same period. The US and the
Philippines conducted the biggest joint military exercise to date this
year. Biden became the first US president to sell a nuclear submarine to
a foreign country in 63 years, selling three to Australia earlier this
year. India and Pakistan have doubled their military budget over the
last ten years. A key goal of Modi's red-carpet visit to Washington was
to secure defense deals from the US, even as the average Indian worker
still earns \$330 per month.

China has increased its military budget 75% over the last 10 years.
[**[The US gov]{.mark}ernment** [claims]{.mark} China is constructing
200 new missile silos, expanding its mobile-launch capability, and
upgrading its submarine fleet. It is claimed that Chinese President
[Xi]{.mark} Jinping [has set the target of]{.mark} being capable of
[invading Taiwan]{.mark} by 2027, [though there are doubts]{.mark} about
the timeline of this goal]{.underline}. Invading Taiwan would require a
war on a scale far bigger than Ukraine and almost certainly mean a
direct confrontation with US imperialism.

Killing is Cheaper

In May, [The Economist coldly explained that [**military spending**
today gets "more bang for your buck,"]{.mark} [highlighting the]{.mark}
real [value capitalism puts on human]{.mark} life. [Robotics]{.mark} has
[made]{.mark} modern, [imperialist armies]{.mark} [cheaper to
deploy.]{.mark}]{.underline} Brazil spends 78% of its military budget on
soldiers compared with less than 50% in NATO armies. Official US
government data shows the price of a missile has fallen 30% since the
1970's.

[[Weapons are]{.mark} also [more destructive]{.mark}. For example, the
price of a fighter jet has remained flat, though one venture capitalist
pointed ou]{.underline}t "These days you can hit dozens of targets with
a single bomber, rather than vice versa, which used to be the case,"
argues James Geurts, a retired air-force colonel who advises Lux
Capital, a venture-capital firm.

The Threat of Nuclear War

Obama, Trump, and Biden all changed [US nuclear policy to open the door
to a "first strike," i.e. launching nuclear weapons first, not just when
you are attacked.]{.underline} Putin has revised Soviet-era nuclear
doctrine to make it more vague and conditional and has threatened to use
nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Both the U.S. and Russia are spending
hundreds of millions on smaller tactical nuclear weapons -- "first
strike" weapons designed to destroy military installations without
provoking an all-out catastrophic counterattack.

China is the only nuclear-armed country that formally adheres to a
no-first-strike doctrine. However, they recently tested their Fractional
Orbital Bombardment System, a weapon system that is only useful as a
first-strike weapon. Hypersonic cruise missiles, which are being
researched by every major imperialist country, are designed to evade
missile defense systems.

These weapons are inherently dangerous because of the logic of nuclear
war: if you believe your opponent can knock out your weapons, why not
use your weapons first? Nuclear inspectors claim Iran is capable of
developing a nuclear weapon in 12 days, if it ramped up its uranium
enrichment. The right-wing Netanyahu regime has pledged to attack Iran
if it develops nuclear weapons.

The Reemergence of Conventional Weapons

Despite what imperialist countries claim, modern warfare is no less
deadly and dehumanizing than before. There have been tens of thousands
of casualties in the months-long "meatgrinder" battle for the Ukrainian
city of Bakhmut including in human wave attacks. This evokes the battles
of the world wars in the 20th century.

[T[he US is increasing production of]{.mark} 155mm [artillery]{.mark}
shells, a weapon design that has changed little over the last hundred
years, to 24,000/month]{.underline} -- a sixfold increase since last
year. The US is researching new and more deadly landmines. Land mines
were "outlawed" in 1997 because they have indiscriminately killed
hundreds of thousands of people, often decades after wars end.

In Taiwan, US military advisors are shying away from fancy, "smart"
weapons to defend against a Chinese attack. Inspired by the bloodshed in
Ukraine, they are shipping machine guns, handheld missiles, and bullets
to Taiwan, and training civilian militias for house-to-house guerilla
warfare.

We Need a Socialist Alternative

[For now, [**US imperialism** is]{.mark} still [the **main driving force
of war**]{.mark}**fare** across the world, and [this has been
made]{.mark} [possible by]{.mark} nearly unanimous consent among both
[corporate parties.]{.mark}]{.underline} Even self-described
"socialists" like Bernie and The Squad have backed imperialism outright,
or failed to mount an effective resistance to imperialist militarism by
using their position to call for anti-war protests.

[This [capitulation]{.mark} has opened the door for right-wing populists
to pose as anti-war candidates on a nationalist basis, even though the
nationalism of a capitalist superpower like the United States always
points back towards more imperialism.]{.underline} What is needed is a
genuinely socialist, internationalist resistance to imperialism, which
fights for the interests of the working class in every country to end
war once and for all.

#### The call for military logistics solidifies elite control -- contracts, data collection, warfare -- and fuel endless wars.

[**[Militarized]{.mark} [accumulation]{.mark}** certainly [plays an
important role for global cap]{.mark}italism. All major financial
institutions have billions invested in the [three]{.mark} big [US
military corporations]{.mark}---[Boeing, Lockheed]{.mark} Martin, and
[Northrop]{.mark} Grumman---[about \$120 billion]{.mark} in total
(Phillips, 2018). Government contracts with the military industrial
complex add close to another \$700 billion]{.underline} (Cancian, 2019).
Moreover, 15 million are employed by private military companies doing
everything from data collection and warfare, to running private
detention and interrogation facilities (Robinson, 2020). Additionally,
about 880,000 work in the arms industry. [[Arms and aerospace
production]{.mark} also encompass the maquiladora sector in Mexico,
which [exported \$9.6 billion]{.mark} to the US in 2019 (Bacon,
2020).]{.underline} As military analyst Loren Thompson noted, "This
White House has been more open to defense industry executives than any
other in living memory" (LaForgia and Bogdanich, 2020).

But these figures need to be put into context. [[The world's 17 largest
financial institutions control **\$41**]{.mark} [**trillion**, with
investments in every sector]{.mark} of the global economy]{.underline}
(Phillips, 2018). Therefore, militarized accumulation is significant,
but only one part of a much larger picture. Moreover, corporate
investments don't necessarily translate into ideology. [For most large
investors [holding stocks]{.mark} in the arms [industry is]{.mark} **[no
different from]{.mark} their holdings in [logistics]{.mark}**, pharmacy,
or other industries.]{.underline} But for some the military industrial
complex does represent the majority of their wealth, their political
position, careers and networks. These fit into Robinson's authoritarian
fraction. But for most TCC members there is no direct relationship
between having Boeing or Raytheon in their portfolio and supporting an
authoritarian state. Nonetheless, [beyond economics [there is]{.mark}
considerable **[ideological]{.mark} and culture [power]{.mark}**
[embedded in]{.mark} [military]{.mark} history and [mythology that
supports its influence]{.mark} throughout society.]{.underline} This
adds considerable power to the authoritarian bloc and speaks to their
ability to form a substantial populist base.

The expropriation of land in Daechuri was not carried out with the
intention of creating workers for the capitalist economy of the military
base, though it certainly achieves that outcome. [Instead, [the
DOD]{.mark} [needed]{.mark} the land for [a strategically located
military base]{.mark} meant [to secure **US geopolitical and capitalist
interests**]{.mark} in Asia. Here, we see the transnational
collaboration of state violence at work between the South Korean state
and the US empire. [The deployment of South Korean police]{.mark} and
military to remove Daechuri residents [exemplifies a]{.mark} longer
[history of]{.mark} the collusion of South Korean "[violence]{.mark}
workers]{.underline}"5 operating on behalf of the United States to
ensure the continued US "protection" of South Korea from communist
incursions on its borders. [We saw this in the 1960s, when the South
Korean government deployed 340,000 of its citizens to fight and die in
the US war in Vietnam,]{.underline} and when it has suppressed the
"Yankee Go Home!" antimilitary protests that have erupted continuously
since the 1980s. The expansion of US imperial capital in the post-1945
era has required the outsourcing of state violence to host countries and
allied states, so that the US military can keep its hands clean in
quelling popular resistance while continuing its operations.6

[Indeed, [the expansion of Camp Humphreys is part of]{.mark} an
extensive, long-term [reposturing]{.mark} of [the US military]{.mark} in
Asia that aligns [with the **"pivot to Asia"**]{.mark}]{.underline}
policy begun under the Obama administration. The expansion entails
closing the Yongsan Garrison in Seoul, the headquarters of the US forces
in Korea and a major site of South Korean citizens' protest, and
restationing troops away from the Seoul metropolitan area and the
Demilitarized Zone.[7 Camp Humphreys's [geographical siting signals the
attempt by the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates to strengthen its position
in the Asia-Pacific region. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) was a
part of this "pivot to Asia" that relies on relationships of diplomacy,
including trade and commerce, but is also always backed up by the muscle
of the military.]{.underline} The apparent demise of the TPP means that
Camp Humphreys will likely become increasingly important to US dominance
in the region, especially against the rising competitive power of China,
which is already making its own trade agreements with nations like
Malaysia in the wake of TPP's demise and creating new artificial islands
for military bases in the region.8

[We open with a discussion of the Daechuri Art and Peace Village and
Camp Humphreys because [these]{.mark} [spaces]{.mark} highlight many of
the [**critical issues threaded** through t]{.mark}he pages that follow:
**[militarism as a structure]{.mark}** of everyday life under
capitalism; [the role of the state in managing]{.mark} the
contradictions of militarized [capital]{.mark}, from suppressing dissent
to mobilizing labor; violence that exceeds the temporal and spatial
boundaries of formal combat, [as well as]{.mark} the discursive boundary
between "**[soft" and "hard" power]{.mark}**; and the spaces of
sociality where local workers and foreign soldiers
interact]{.underline}. The following essays show that the relations of
violence that converged in Pyeongtaek in recent years are not
exceptional to this particular locale but have animated other sites of
the US empire where the imperatives of militarism and capitalism
converge. They also show the creative militancy of people who are on the
front lines of documenting communities and lifeways lost to these
convergent forces---similar to the art making and place-based
memorialization at Daechuri---and who insist that another world is
possible.

The [[pervasiveness of militarism]{.mark} in America [is a direct result
of its lucrativeness for the elitist minority]{.mark}. From 2001 to
2011, [defense]{.mark} industry [profits increased fourfold]{.mark},
making it one of the most profitable industries in the US.]{.underline}
Since militarism benefits the oligarchy, it has been expanding like a
metastasizing cancer in new garbs---from Ronald Reagan's "confederation
of terrorist states" in a new "international Murder Inc." and Bush II's
"axis of evil," to John Bolton's "troika of tyranny."

[Aided by several ideological fabrications, [U.S. war-making]{.mark} has
become [global]{.mark} in the sense that [its]{.mark} military [doctrine
concerns itself with]{.mark} "total **[domain awareness]{.mark}**" and
"full spectrum dominance."]{.underline} This approach is characterized
by hyper-vigilance and hyper-interventionism---both of which lead to the
creation of an expensive, sprawling military empire.

[[The]{.mark} American [military has a]{.mark} staggeringly [strong
global reach]{.mark}, deploying nearly [200,000 troops overseas]{.mark}
garrisoned on at least [800 bases in 130 countries]{.mark}, and
maintaining 11 aircraft carrier task forces to patrol the global
seas.]{.underline} Starting from 2001, the country further consolidated
its military capabilities, initiating a new kind of expansionism.

As per a testimony by General Raymond A. [Thomas, the former Commander
of Special Operations Command, [the U.S. is engaged in]{.mark}
counterterrorism and [war in]{.mark} between 80 and [90
countries]{.mark} in the world.]{.underline} From 2001 to 2016[, the
Pentagon spent \$8.5 trillion on its global war on terror. According to
Brown University's "Costs of War" project, in 2001--2020 the budgetary
costs of wars in which the U.S. has largely failed to achieve its
military and political objectives stand at \$6.4 trillion.]{.underline}

For ordinary Americans[, [**intensified militarism** has meant the
**degeneration** of]{.mark} an existence already devoid of [basic
requirements]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [An average family of four
in the USA sees some \$13,200 a year of its wealth deposited into the
Pentagon,]{.underline} which spends about a trillion dollars annually
from all sources to prosecute several wars simultaneously[. Further,
[the]{.mark} \$[260 billion spent]{.mark} annually [on war]{.mark} have
created about 1.8 million jobs, whereas that same amount invested in
infrastructure [could have created 2.5]{.mark} [million
**jobs**]{.mark}. If invested in **[healthcare]{.mark}**, it would

Private Military Companies ([[PMCs]{.mark}) represent another facet of
military capitalism]{.underline}, emerging prominently in the late 20th
century. [PMCs [are private entities that provide]{.mark} military
services, including **[logistics]{.mark},** [training]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} combat [support]{.mark}. Companies]{.underline} like
Blackwater (now Academi) and [DynCorp have been contracted by

Militarism?"
<https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/atc/2477.html> //KKang

We can say that the [[U.S.]{.mark} economy [can't do without]{.mark} the
[defense industry]{.mark} and needs to create reasons for its very
existence;]{.underline} or we can say [that [U.S. capital, **to
sustain**]{.mark} **its [hegemony]{.mark}**[, needs an]{.mark}
[**ideological substitute** for the old enemy]{.mark}, the]{.underline}
Soviet Union. But if these are the principal functions of capitalist
militarism today, they are too indirect and indeterminate to guide us in
our attitude to U.S. military interventions in, say, Haiti, Somalia or
Bosnia.

Not the least of our problems [in understanding the new functions of
capitalist militarism is that capitalist states themselves are still
uncertain about the role of military power in the new world
order.]{.underline} How, then, should we go about exploring the new
functions of capitalist militarism?

One obvious place to begin is to [uncover the new contradictions in the
capitalist world order.]{.underline} Maybe it isn't true, for example,
that capitalism is incapable of universalizing itself, but what is
surely true is that a successful capitalism can never be completely
universal.

[[The logic of capitalism]{.mark}, [its imperatives of **competition**,
guarantee]{.mark} that [not all capitalisms can be]{.mark}
[winners]{.mark}, and that former winners can also become losers. The
irony is that]{.underline} now the very success of
[capitalism]{.underline} in imposing its systemic logic on the whole
[world is turning advanced capitalist societies into potential
losers.]{.underline}

And here we come up against another contradiction: the economic
weaknesses of advanced capitalist societies are not, of course,
necessarily accompanied by a commensurate military decline. There is no
direct proportionality between economic success and military strength,
as declining capitalist economies have retained their imperial military
power.

Here, then, are the new contradictions we have to confront in explaining
the function of capitalist militarism on the eve of the twenty-first
century. Nowhere are those contradictions more clearly evident than in
the USA.

[In the absence of a well-elaborated theory, let me first propose some
very untheorized rules of thumb:]{.underline} Offhand[, [I can't think
of]{.mark} any recent [U.S. military intervention that]{.mark} has
[produced results]{.mark} [more good than bad]{.mark}, whatever its
motivation. Somalia, for example]{.underline}, the intervention that
seemed most disinterested, was an utter disaster.

I'm not sure why [U.S. military **[interventions are]{.mark} so
[typically disastrous]{.mark}**]{.underline}---whether disaster is
structurally inscribed in its motivations or in its methods and
organization (e.g. a military apparatus specifically designed for
high-tech mass destruction, carpet-bombing and related methods, not
readily adaptable to any other mode of warfare), or whether there is
some deep-seated social and cultural reason.

But more fundamentally, [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[illustrates the dangers of]{.mark} the **[new contradictions]{.mark}**:
Here is [a declining **economic**]{.mark} power, deeply riven [by
internal social **divisions**]{.mark} and [a disintegrating
social]{.mark} [fabric]{.mark}, which nevertheless possesses the most
overwhelming and unchallenged military power the world has ever
known.]{.underline}

This is a dangerous mixture; [and [even failing an explanation of U.S.
militarism]{.mark} as neat and unambiguous as classic theories of
imperialism[, it seems]{.mark} to me [reason enough to question]{.mark}
any U.S. [military]{.mark} intervention.]{.underline}

At any rate, even [if neither direct accumulation, nor redivision of
territory, nor even suppression of anti-capitalist struggle is the main
objective of capitalist militarism, what happens when military power
becomes a substitute for economic strength and social
cohesion?]{.underline}

Abstract: [[**Facing a crisis of legitimacy**, the capitalist class is
**constructing**]{.mark} **new [hegemonic projects to]{.mark} [stabilize
their]{.mark} global [system]{.mark}.**]{.underline} This article will
examine competiting fractions of the transnational capitalist class
(TCC), how these [fractions are confronting the crisis of global
capitalism]{.underline}, and how TCC theory analyzes the current state
of conflict. [[TCC]{.mark} [theorists see]{.mark} the development of two
hegemonic projects, one based on [**militarized accumulation** and
authoritarian politics]{.mark} and that of green capitalist
reformism.]{.underline} But differences exist on the evaluation of the
strength and formation of these emerging blocs. [The article also
[pay]{.mark}s [attention to the]{.mark} relationship between the [US and

Keywords: Authoritarian capitalism, green capitalism, green new deal,
hegemonic blocs, militarized accumulation, transnational capitalist
class.

Introduction

[Transnational Capitalist Class (TCC) theory (Sklair 2001, Robinson
2004, Harris 2016) has often been criticized for holding a Kautsky-like
view of super-imperialism.]{.underline} A world where national
capitalist competition seemingly disappears in a harmonious exploitation
of the world[. But [the capitalist class,]{.mark} whether national or
transnational, [has always fought over political strategy and
markets]{.mark} (Robinson and Harris, 2000). Currently capitalist
competition is mainly between transnational corporations]{.underline}
(TNCs) whose ownership structures include a mix of transnational
capitalists. Nevertheless, national ideology and its political
manifestations have never disappeared. Contradictions between
nation-centric social relations and transnational restructuring is a
historic dialectic, and the struggle between the two defines the
contours of our contemporary world.

[[The question here is how]{.mark} do [aspects]{.mark} of the national
and transnational [translate into political]{.mark} divisions and
[competition under]{.mark} the current conditions of [social and
economic crisis]{.mark} and how do transnational capitalist theorists
view these developments.]{.underline} The capitalist class seeks
stability through the construction of hegemonic blocs (Gramsci, 1971).
Such [[blocs coalesce a **ruling consensus**]{.mark} around a
configuration of accumulation and social relations. [This necessitates a
**broadly supported elite consensus**]{.mark}, with a political and
social base among the working and middle class.]{.underline} For those
radical class elements refusing to be incorporated there is the
repressive heal of the state.

#### Heiserman indicates commercial interests in increasing investment

\<\<1AC Heiserman '25\>\>

The [**Port of Valdez** is a deepwater port that offers
**year-round**]{.underline}, [**ice-free** access to the **Gulf of
Alaska**]{.underline} and the North Pacific Ocean. Its strategic
position makes it indispensable for military operations in the Arctic
region and the Pacific Rim, providing a vital entry and exit point for
supplies, military personnel, and equipment. Valdez is the southern
terminus of the North Slope's Trans-Alaska pipeline, handling over 95
percent of the state's crude oil. Valdez is the only seaport in Alaska
certified to handle munitions and the closest US munition certified port
to Taiwan. Valez's importance is stressed even more because there is no
rail link from the contiguous United States to Alaska. Munitions are
likely transported via roadway, which is concerning because of Alaska\'s
lack of roadway and winter conditions, which could limit the window for
resupply.

[[Establishing a **rail link**]{.underline},]{.mark} like the previously
proposed Alaska to Alberta (A2A) railway, [[would facilitate quicker
movement of]{.mark} military and **[commercial
good]{.mark}s**]{.underline}, enhancing the United States' strategic
posture in the Arctic and across the Pacific. Unfortunately, the project
is currently on hold. Still, [the potential for reducing shipping times
by linking the Port of Valdez and Anchorage to the North American rail
network could significantly impact **military** and **commercial
operations**]{.underline}, [[potentially shortening **delivery
times**]{.underline}]{.mark} between North America and Asia by two to
four days, enhancing responsiveness in conflict scenarios.

[Economic]{.underline}, environmental, and **[human

Additionally, we have observed steady but **measured [growth]{.mark}**
[of shipping]{.mark} through the **Bering Strait over**]{.underline} the

to experience longer and larger periods of reduced or ice-free

continue to explore the possibility of seasonal trans-Arctic commercial
shipping through the three Polar routes.

#### Pincus - The plan gets co-opted by capitalists -- economic interests prevail

[[The U.S. has **economic interests**]{.mark} in]{.underline} the
**[Arctic maritime]{.underline}**, [including
[fisheries]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[energy]{.underline}]{.mark},
shipping, [and [tourism]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [Alaskan fishing

according to an industry group, and generates over \$15 billion in

#### Heiserman legitimizes modernization in the Arctic to secure aggressive U.S. economic dominance

\<\<1AC Heiserman '25\>\>

[By contrast]{.underline}, [[Russia knows]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[NSR
is]{.mark} an **[eco]{.mark}nomic [asset]{.mark}** [and is **investing
resources**]{.mark}]{.underline} to boost commercial transit along this
route. [Russia holds]{.underline} the [largest **Arctic
territory**]{.underline} in the world, with a coastline of 15,000 miles,
making up about 20 percent of its total landmass and 53 percent of the
Arctic coastline. [The region is vital **for Russia\'s
economy**]{.underline}, particularly [due to its significant oil **and
gas reserves**]{.underline} which contribute about 20 percent to the
country\'s GDP.

In 2019, Russia invested \$164.2 billion in its Arctic territories, with
substantial backing from Chinese financial entities. Despite facing
military challenges elsewhere, Russia continues to strengthen its Arctic
presence by maintaining and expanding military infrastructure, including
bases, submarine ports, airfields, and deep-water ports, and by
enhancing its fleet of 40 icebreakers with 76mm armament.

In a 2018 white paper, [[China made]{.mark} its **Arctic
[ambitions]{.mark}** [explicit by releasing]{.mark} its **[Arctic
strategy]{.mark}**]{.underline} and [declaring itself a]{.underline}
\"**[near-Arctic State]{.underline}**.\" The strategy includes the
development of the Polar Silk Road, aligning with China's broader Belt
and Road Initiative, which aims to connect East Asia with Europe via
Arctic routes such as the Northwest Passage (NWP), NSR, and a potential
future Transpolar Sea Route (TSR).

Since 2013, [China has **[significantly engaged]{.mark}**]{.underline}
in the Arctic, [[marking six transits that moved **ten million**]{.mark}
**ton[s]{.mark} of [goods]{.mark}**]{.underline} like gas, oil, grain,
and coal primarily through the NSR. [A notable portion]{.underline} of
this maritime traffic [involves vessels that either **originate from**
or are destined for **Chinese ports**]{.underline}. This level of
activity starkly contrasts with the more limited US engagement in the
Arctic, which includes a few North Pole traversals by the US Coast Guard
Cutter Healy, some in conjunction with China\'s Xue Long II icebreaker,
suspected of conducting military operations under scientific pretenses.

[China's Arctic [investments are **extensive and**
]{.mark}**strategic**]{.underline}, [focusing on
[economic]{.mark}]{.underline}, scientific, [and infrastructure
developments]{.underline}. These investments are particularly
concentrated in Greenland, where they have significantly impacted
Greenland's economy, including securing a mining license for the Isua
iron mine near Nuuk. [China\'s investments]{.underline} also [include
collaboration with **Russian companies**]{.underline} in the Arctic,
[participating in projects like **seismic mapping**]{.underline},
deep-water **[drilling rigs construction]{.underline}**, [and port
developments]{.underline} along the Northern Dvina River. A new railway
to transport raw materials from Siberia to these ports is also under
development.

US Challenges

The [[**logistical challenges** posed by **Alaska's
isolation**]{.underline}]{.mark} and harsh environment are complex, made
worse by distance. This [is [exacerbated by]{.mark} the [lack of
adequate **transportation**]{.mark} **and
[resupply]{.mark}**]{.underline} in and through Alaska. Alaska\'s road
network is only about 14,336 miles of public roads compared to 313,000
miles in Texas, which is almost 2.5 times smaller than Alaska. Given
Alaska's limited rail capacity, Alaska relies heavily on airlifts,
trucking, or shipping for transporting supplies, equipment, and
personnel.

The [Don Young]{.underline} Port of Alaska in Anchorage [is a
designated]{.underline} as a US [Commercial Strategic
Seaport]{.underline}, which handles 90 percent military sustainment. It
is also the only port in Alaska certified to receive aviation fuel.
[Despite its significance]{.underline}, the port's
**[[infra]{.mark}structure [is aging]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the docking
capacity is limited, all made worse by erosion and seismic activity.
[[Thankfully, the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is now taking steps to
correct this with a]{.mark}n estimated [\$2 billion dollar modernization
project,]{.mark} which kicked off in June 2024.]{.underline}

to boost our capacity to deter in the Arctic.

SULLIVAN: Great. Mr. Marchese, do you have a view on that?

MARCHESE: Senator, I couldn\'t agree with you more. [You\'re preaching

wrong with fishing at your feet. We have everything we need here. It\'s
great that we\'re going to Greenland, but [[let\'s concentrate
on]{.mark} what we can control, which is [United States
investment]{.mark}.]{.underline}

SULLIVAN: Great. Thank you. Dr, Mercer?

MERCER: Thank you for the question, sir. As I said before, [[America
is]{.mark} the world\'s [leader in scientific
research]{.mark}]{.underline}. That\'s certainly true in the polar
regions. [[We rely]{.mark} heavily, in order to be the leader in
research in the polar regions, [on]{.mark} Coast Guard
[icebreakers]{.mark}, the LC-130 [aircraft]{.mark}, the C-17 aircraft,
[the Space Base]{.mark} Pituffik in Greenland. As I noted in my opening
testimony, [we're in the design process to **recapitalize** and
modernize]{.mark} [Summit Station]{.mark} at the center of the Greenland
ice sheet.]{.underline}

SULLIVAN: Great. Thank you. Dr. Pincus?

PINCUS: Thank you, Senator. I agree that [[we are seeing]{.mark}
increased **[adversary presence]{.mark}** in the region [because they
**perceive weakness**]{.mark}]{.underline} on their part. And so
they\'re pressing us there.

SULLIVAN: By the way, it\'s not on this chart. I have another one that
shows they're---I think some of the witnesses said this
earlier---they\'re building up their infrastructure, particularly
military, but also [energy]{.underline} and critical mineral
[[infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}, [in a **huge way** in the

https://libcom.org/article/ice-breaker-imperialism //reyrey

[The [current crisis in the world economy]{.mark} has [spurred]{.mark}
the various imperialist players to drive towards]{.underline}
increasingly desperate and [[destructive policies]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[**[Unable to overcome]{.mark}** the logic of
**[capital]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the tendency for its rate of
profit to fall, the [various actors [in the global imperialist
framework]{.mark} are now [thrashing in]{.mark} the cold [Arctic
waters]{.mark}, [a region witnessing **extreme militarization** in light
of]{.mark} the desperate **[imperialist rivalry]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
The new imperialist arena has [opened up due to rapid and catastrophic
**environmental calamity**, which has made it possible. The
Arctic]{.underline} no longer presents itself as an icy desert, but is
instead [a region of **increasingly attractive** mineral and energy
resources along with **coveted sea routes** which could be more
lucrative than the Panama or Suez canals.]{.underline} Salivating over
these minerals are Chinese **[industrialists]{.underline}** who
desperately desire the resources required to stoke their ever expanding
factories and their Canadian counterparts whose grip on global mining
presents itself as a life or death scenario. [[Nervous over]{.mark}
these [**sea routes** are]{.mark} American [admirals whose]{.mark} fleet
of [aircraft carriers]{.mark} have [long dominated world
commerce]{.mark}]{.underline}, and Russian [[strategists poised to
utilize]{.mark} the **largest fleet of [icebreakers]{.mark}** [to
proclaim dominance over the **"new Suez"**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

With the collapse of the USSR, [the [Arctic]{.mark} was widely
[considered a **special diplomatic zone**]{.mark} for which
**demilitarization** and "cooperation" were presumed to be **the
norm**]{.underline}. This joint recognition was short-lived. [A
[**widening division** between Russia and NATO was]{.mark} exacerbated
by the 2008 financial crisis,]{.underline} which acted as the historical
marker toward this phase of re-militarization and bitter imperialist
rivalry. By 2009, Canadian [generals were vowing to intensify **military
drills** and **increase personnel** in the region, claiming their goal
was to have, "**more boots** on the Arctic Tundra, **more ships** in the
water, and a **better eye** in the sky."(]{.underline}1) The [increase
of Canada's military attention to the Arctic]{.underline} region is [not
surprising]{.underline}. After claiming [the **Northwest Passage**
as]{.underline} [its sovereign waters]{.underline} in the 1990s, by 2003
Canada became the third largest producer of diamonds, found largely in
Nunavut and the Northwest Territories.(2) Canada has long been a major
player in the mining industry across the globe. As of 2013, 75% of the
world's mining companies were headquartered in Canada.(3) When Canadian
Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan toured the Arctic in 2018 the whole
affair was mired in the increasing imperialist competition between
Russia and Canada. Openly and loudly this competition was boasted in the
press as Minister Sajjan made a new commitment to infrastructure and
military equipment.

[Denmark has established a northern military command in Nuuk
Greenland]{.underline}, and in 2013 deployed units to join in Canadian
military operations. [With Denmark extending its claims to the Arctic
sea bed]{.underline} to include larger portions of the Arctic, [it has
bolstered this claim by extending its participation in **annual military
drills** with Canada and the United States]{.underline}, and sought to
acquire more patrol boats for its arctic activity. Denmark's interest in
the region is directly connected to the mineral wealth of Greenland and
the island's strategic position geographically, which has caught the eye
of both Chinese capital and US military strategists.

As early as 2007 Norway declared the Arctic as their strategic priority
in national defence and began a redeployment of most military
headquarters from the south to the north of the country. In 2013 Norway
backed up this commitment by hosting a military drill involving 16,000
troops from 14 nations. In 2018 this was expanded as Norway hosted a
NATO exercise consisting of 40,000 troops. In 2020 Norway signed a
treaty with Sweden and Finland coordinating military cooperation with
the aim to solidify alliances across Scandinavia. And with the United
States granting Norway's request for an increase in American marines on
its soil the Russian state has claimed there will be "consequences" to
such decisions. These moves by NATO forces in the Arctic of course run
parallel to Russian militarization. The symbolic submarine planting of
the Russian flag on the bottom of the ice cap. alongside the Russian
military build-up in the Arctic has been ominous.(4) This buildup has
included everything from the reinstitution of abandoned USSR naval
facilities in the north, a manned amphibious landing drill in 2012, to
sailing a full armada through the Northern Sea Route (NSR) in 2013. One
notable drill took place in 2013 when a series of exercises consisted of
more than 160,000 servicemen, 1,000 tanks, 130 planes and 70 ships, one
of the largest since the collapse of the USSR. By August of 2019 it
would be topped by an even larger military exercise of 300,000 troops,
the largest Russian military drill since 1981. In the meantime, Russia's
state oil giant Rosneft is developing what it claims will be the largest
onshore drilling operation in the world, with trade routes ensured by a
new fleet of nuclear-powered and armed icebreakers capable of subduing
the ice sheets of the NSR.

[This [**drive towards militarization** in the Arctic theater]{.mark}
can [**only be understood** when connected to]{.mark} the [**economic
drive** of]{.mark} both the [great]{.mark} and regional
[powers]{.mark}]{.underline}. With the Arctic warming at twice the rate
of the rest of the globe [previously inaccessible resources now present
themselves to [**profit-starved** **centres of
capital**]{.mark}.]{.underline}(5) It is no surprise that when Putin
commissioned a northern naval base he highlighted the Arctic as a key to
Russian economic success, and in 2017 he cited an estimate of the
mineral wealth alone to be 30 trillion dollars. Chinese industrialists
eye these rich deposits of nickel, iron, lead, zinc, phosphates and
gold, while Torontonian financiers seek to tighten their grip on global
mining. In addition to mineral wealth vast reserves of unrecovered
natural gas and oil are located just under the sea floor. The energy
resources already in use have converted the previously barren North into
a region from which a tenth of oil and a quarter of natural gas in the
world is extracted. [The attraction to this region is not purely for
domestic **economic purposes**]{.underline}. Energy, particularly oil,
has long been critical to "security" and "strategic" positioning inside
the international framework[. The [**relationship** between **capital**
and **military adventurism**]{.mark} has [never been more
apparent]{.mark}.]{.underline}

However, [the **real [prize ]{.mark}**[in the scramble for the
Arctic]{.mark} is control over the two **northern sea routes**, the
[Northwest Passage]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}on the Canadian side
but particularly the Northern Sea Route on the Russian side. Since the
days of mercantilism, [the **development of [capitalism]{.mark}** has
always been [**inseparable** from]{.mark} the
**ever-[expanding]{.mark}** networks of **[naval
distribution]{.mark}.**]{.underline} From the South China Sea to the
Panama Canal, [the [**arteries** of **economic life** ]{.mark}appear
[as]{.mark} the [**vast flow of commodities**]{.mark} atop massive
freighters. Historical events]{.underline} like the [[Suez
Crisis]{.mark} in 1956, or]{.underline} recent events such as the
[blocking of the Suez Canal]{.underline} by the Ever Given[,
[confirm]{.underline} ]{.mark}[the [**indispensability** of]{.mark}
these [passages for **world capital**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The
**enthusiasm** of the **bourgeoisie** to the opening of these northern
passages]{.underline} [can be marked]{.underline} by the celebration of
the cargo ship Nunavik transporting nickel from Quebec to China in 2014.
The voyage took two weeks less than the traditional Panama Canal route.
Coinciding with the opening of Arctic shipping is the Canadian
government's plan to open and expand the infrastructure of deep-water
Arctic ports, with new commitments to build a port in Nunavut and
expanding the infrastructure of the port of Churchill, Manitoba. Across
the pole, Russian policy is even more determined. The building of new
naval bases is always geared toward controlling the NSR. With the first
commercial ship making its way through the NSR in 2018, it can be
estimated that the utilization of the NSR would lead to a reduction of
days at sea by 40 percent in contrast to the traditional route through
the Suez Canal. With 7,000 miles of Arctic coast Russia understands it
is well positioned geographically to dominate what it hopes will rival
the Suez Canal in connecting European and Asian markets. The Russian
strategy is based on its ability to ferry cargo though the NSR with its
modern fleet of nuclear powered icebreakers--with a fee of course. Putin
has remarked that Russian dominance in the Arctic is key to Russia's
economic and strategic future. In response to Russian plans in 2020 the
United States sailed a fleet of four destroyers with anti-submarine
equipment though the Barents Sea. Future maneuvers are prepared to
increase the number of destroyers from four to six. The message is
clear, [America wishes the northern routes to be "economic free zones"
and "international waters", while in real terms waterways would be under
American power.]{.underline}

With the opening of the two northern routes [China was quick to declare
itself a "near Arctic country" and has entered the competition to push
its interests by proclaiming a "polar silk road".]{.underline} The polar
silk road is attached to China's massive Belt and Road Initiative which
seeks to institute massive infrastructure projects throughout Asia,
Africa and Europe to greater tie the world economy to Chinese capital
and openly challenge American capital. Knowing that the NSR through the
Russian northern coast offers the shortest route from China to Europe,
in 2017 China's state-owned shipping giant COSCO has proposed the
development of an Arctic deep-water port on the Northern Dvina River
near the northern Russian city of Archangelsk. Next to this are Chinese
proposals to develop bridges and railroads in Norway and Finland. Even
earlier there was Chinese interest in buying the Canadian Arctic port in
Churchill, an offer which was clearly rejected as the Canadian press in
2020 proudly boasted that the port was 100 percent Canadian-owned. The
American response to the Chinese initiative in the Arctic is exemplified
by former president Donald Trump floating the possibility of purchasing
Greenland from Denmark, where China has invested in rare-minerals. While
the purchase offer for Greenland was rejected by the Danish government,
the Danes did accept a \$12.1 million economic aid package for
Greenland, "aimed at strengthening mutual ties and boosting a renewed
U.S. push for a greater military presence in the Arctic."(6) The point
is clear: The number one priority of the U.S. is to stop the expansion
of Chinese capital at all costs, and to achieve this through preparation
for future military confrontation.

The [**[icebreaker]{.mark}** is the seminal piece of machinery
**required** [to contest]{.mark} the [Arctic waters]{.mark}. Icebreakers
use their strong hulls to bear down on sheets of ice to crack its upper
surface[. A fleet **without icebreakers** is **vulnerable** to]{.mark}
the [**unpredictability** of the **Arctic climate** and]{.mark} runs the
risk of a [**reduction in maneuverability**]{.mark} or even **getting
trapped** in the sea ice.]{.underline} [Russia hosts a fleet of 40
icebr]{.underline}eakers, the largest stock in the world, [including its
new class of nuclear-powered icebreakers]{.underline}. This has American
officials lamenting that the Russians can treat, "\[the\] Northern Sea
Route like it's the Mississippi River."(7) [The **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [fears]{.mark}]{.underline} that the Russian edge in
geography and hardware will turn what is predicted to become a major
shipping route into [[a Russian dominated]{.mark} toll
[route]{.mark}]{.underline}. In contrast, the United States can only
boast of possessing 3 icebreakers, which [officials fear [leaves them
vulnerable and **unable to compete**]{.mark} despite America's otherwise
massive capabilities.]{.underline} Meanwhile, China has announced its
plan to build its own class of nuclear-powered icebreakers and Canada
can field 13 of its own icebreakers.

[The [**current state** of]{.mark} the stock of [U.S. icebreakers has
the]{.mark} American [Defense Department decrying an "**icebreaker
gap**",]{.mark} reminiscent of the **cold war** **"missile
gap".**]{.underline} In response to this "gap", former President
[**Trump** demanded a new fleet of icebreakers be
commissioned]{.underline}, containing 3 heavy and 3 medium icebreakers,
to be ready [by 2029.]{.underline} While the U.S. Coast Guard announced
it had signed a \$746 million contract for the design and construction
of a new class of heavy icebreakers. Nonetheless, the [U.S. Defense
Department's [obsession]{.mark} over the **'icebreaker gap'** [has not
been quelled]{.mark}, with American admirals nervously stuttering to the
press "who puts missiles on icebreakers?"]{.underline}(8) when remarking
on Russia arming its nuclear-powered icebreaker fleet. In contrast to
[the American [military worried]{.mark} if it can defend **crucial
chokepoints**]{.underline}, such as the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom
corridor, the Russian Northern Fleet is conducting a study of combat
operations in the western and eastern Arctic sea zones via large
military drills. The situation is clear. [The [dire **economic
situation** facing the **bourgeoisie**]{.mark} has [spurred an **arms
race** in the **Arctic Theatre**]{.mark}. As [**capitalism** **meanders
toward** **another crisis**]{.mark}, [no actors]{.mark} in the fight for
Arctic dominance appear [willing to stand down]{.mark}]{.underline}.
While it is always "too soon" to declare a potential site for
inter-imperialist bickering to result in global conflagration, there is
reason to shed light on maneuverings in the Arctic. The climate has
assuredly and permanently opened the once-frozen landscape to
exploitation. Decades ago, the question was "is it possible for conflict
to arise here?" Today, we must ask "how soon should we expect it?" as
the massive centers of national capital scramble to secure the dwindling
profits.

What is clear is that [[**capitalism's response** to its **crisis**
]{.mark}**of profitability** [is]{.mark} the escalation of
[**imperialist competition**]{.mark} next to **massive attacks** [on
the]{.mark} condition of the **[working class]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
What does this crisis mean for Chinese workers but the 996 work week and
fighter jets over Taiwan. What does this crisis mean for Canadian
workers but larger military drills and rising rents. What does this
crisis mean for Russian workers but tank maneuvers on the borders of
Europe and longer hours. What does this crisis mean for American workers
but Uber-style jobs and an icebreaker build up. What else can this mean
but that "the main enemy is at home"! [For the bosses misery and
militarism are the solutions to the crisis. Against the bosses drive
towards total barbarism the solution of the working class can only be a
world communist revolution!]{.underline}

[[The **workings of global markets**]{.mark} are [typically
**invisible**]{.mark}---dissolved in the abstract, quasi-magical
relations of [capital flows.]{.mark}]{.underline}

As publicized [[images]{.underline}]{.mark} of the machinic wonders of
modernity, [they also served as **promissory notes**, [enticing
investors to **purchase shares** in]{.mark} the joint-stock [Suez
Canal]{.mark} Company]{.underline}. The photographs
[[telegraphed]{.mark} seductive [promises of **financial gain**]{.mark},
pictorializing the genius of European engineering that could dig a
manmade channel across the African continent]{.underline}. Running
through the pictures, historian Mohamed Gamal-Eldin discovered, was a
striking pattern. For the technological sublime to work its wonder on
the awed spectator, the photos had to be evacuated of the laboring
subjects who made the feat possible: the many tens of thousands of
dispossessed fellahin---peasants---who dug the monumental canal by hand.

[What sense of the sublime, after all, could be gleaned from scenes of
corvée labor toiling under a punishing sun? Hundreds died---from
cholera, from accidents, by drowning in the process]{.underline}. The
shrewd aesthetics of anonymity served a thinly veiled political
function. Depopulated landscapes of gargantuan automation are studded
with a few indistinct laborers, made to seem inconsequential to the task
at hand. It is a colonial engineer's fantasy---a celebration of the
mastery of European man over the landscape of colonized Egypt, and a
paean to the centrality of French technological power in an industrial
age that supposedly less developed Egyptians had yet to grasp. The
effect is to body forth what Alberto Toscano calls a "world already
without us," the conceit of capitalism that reproduces itself in
abstract images of human-altered landscapes devoid of the working hands
that fashion them. "The dead labor embodied in machinery suddenly swells
to inhuman proportions," Fredric Jameson likewise observes in
Representing Capital (2011). "The quantities of the past have been
rendered invisible . . . yet they now surround the worker in a
proportion hitherto unthinkable."

This same effacement of labor marked many depictions of the Ever
Given---the colossal container ship that ran aground in the Suez Canal
for six days in late March, blocking this pivotal artery of global
trade. As the whole world looked on, aerial photographs and wide-lens
panoramas struggled to capture the ship's scale in a single frame.
Humans, even other machines, barely register alongside it. Stacked with
18,000 containers and millions of dollars of goods, stretching more than
1,312 feet from end to end, the ship is twice as long as the Suez Canal
is wide in the narrow passage where it ran aground. Its geopolitical
proportions are equally mindboggling: Japanese-owned, German-managed,
and Taiwanese-operated, it is registered in Panama and captained by a
crew of Indian seamen. The industrial sublime had returned.

Images of the ship went viral. After more than a year of public health
emergency, brought on by a virus too small to see, the Ever Given surely
captured our attention in part because its fate expressed the stalled
feeling of a whole planet suspended in pandemic time. For a few days the
world seemed a little less inscrutable, brought down to scale by a
simpler and more satisfying causality. The workings of global markets,
like those of microbes, are typically invisible, dissolved in the
abstract, numerical, quasi-magical relations of capital flows. But this?
A big boat got stuck. The stuck boat was big. And people had to get it
unstuck.

To understand the particular saga of the Ever Given, we have to
understand the larger global history of maritime commerce.

This simplicity conceals depths of its own, however, and the story of
how we got to this point---where monstrous ships dwarf the canals they
sail in---also deserves excavation. Two timely new books help to do that
work, unmasking a [**colossal [maritime system]{.mark}** []{.mark}whose
obsessions with **monstrous infrastructure** [reflect structures of
**profit-making** that]{.mark} have long [sought to reduce, deregulate,
and hierarchize]{.mark} the [**labor** that lubricates the **movement of
goods**]{.mark}.]{.underline} In this regime, [[constant **circulation
of commodities**]{.mark} has [become **central** t]{.mark}o the
"**health" of [the global economy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To understand
the particular saga of the Ever Given, we have to understand the larger
global history of maritime commerce.

Oceans as Arteries

I encountered the realities of this system firsthand during ethnographic
fieldwork in 2015, when I spent six weeks riding across the Pacific
Ocean on another vessel owned by Evergreen (the company that operates
the Ever Given). Its capacity was 8,100 TEU---the standard unit of cargo
size, based on the volume of a standard twenty-foot container box. That
is only some 40 percent of the Ever Given's capacity, but still the ship
was as long as two Eiffel towers are tall. The crew comprised
twenty-three, all men. For forty-eight days at sea, we scrubbed rust,
swabbed the deck, cleaned the walls of forecastle, mended leaky pipes,
and monitored the temperature of reefers, the refrigerated containers
holding perishable goods. Except for the faint smell of apples
interlaced with the stench of the heavy fuel oil, the crew knew nothing
of the contents of the thousands of containers on board.

This is par for the course. In the era of containerization, ships no
longer carry shipping manifests. A clerk in Shenzhen or Los Angeles
calculates what cargo should be loaded and where, and sailors are there
to maintain the lifespan of the ship, keeping rust, dirt, and engine
malfunctions at bay. The alienation of workers from the value of their
labor that Karl Marx first described in the context of factories is only
compounded on the ocean. Whatever the containers carry---from microchips
to rubber chickens, produce to hazardous waste---is rendered illegible
to the workers charged with ensuring their circulation. [The container,
economist Marc Levinson has written, ["made the **world smaller** and
the **world economy bigger**."]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}Its main
innovation was what the industry calls "intermodality": it could be
detached from trucks, lifted by crane, and stacked directly onto
oceangoing vessels, standardizing and radically reducing the costs of
transportation.

The first container ship to cross the Atlantic, the SS Fairland,
provided proof of concept in 1966; a year later, the company that owned
it would carry war materiel from the West Coast to Cam Ranh Bay during
the Vietnam War and ship boxes back to the United States stuffed with
Japanese goods. But even as the world got bigger, workers got
shortchanged. Containers ushered in the mechanization of ports, just as
states, acting with and like corporations, sought to repress the power
of organized longshore labor. Jobs that had once required multiple gangs
of stevedores to load and unload goods from ships were almost entirely
wiped out. Unloading became the lonely work of pushing levers atop
behemoth gantry cranes that lift and drop steel boxes into an endless
grid of squares.

[[Unique among]{.mark} other spaces of **[capitalist
production]{.mark}**, [the sea is both **passageway** and
**precondition** for **capitalism** to conquer **new
frontiers**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Abstraction is, in large part, the point of logistics. In their new book
Capitalism and the Sea: The Maritime Factor in the Making of the Modern
World, Liam Campling and Alejandro Colás argue that ["[circulation is
**the lifeblood** of **global capitalism**, and the oceans act
as]{.mark} its **[arteries]{.mark}**." Unique among other spaces of
capitalist production, the sea is **both** **passageway** and
**precondition** for capitalism to conquer new frontiers.]{.underline}
Prior to World War II, it had been cheaper and more efficient for
industrial producers to use iron and coal as energy sources, but after
the war the 1948 Marshall Plan changed the economic calculus with
investment in oil infrastructure. Oil was lighter and easier to
transport, and embracing it would weaken the structural power of
European miners whose strikes could shut down production. Thus, as
Timothy Mitchell explains in Carbon Democracy (2014), the global shift
from coal to oil simultaneously and conveniently dealt a severe blow to
working-class power.

//reyrey

The [[**Department of Defense** recently introduced]{.mark} its
[**first-of-a-kind** industrial strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}, raising
the point that the United States is no longer the arsenal of democracy,
and our adversaries know it. Not only has [our **industrial base**
[**eroded** over]{.mark} the [past decades ]{.mark}]{.underline}but our
most important long-range missiles (Harpoons, Tomahawks, JDAMs, JRAMs
and others) cannot be made without dozens of Chinese suppliers. This
comes on the heels of the PPBE Commission, the Atlantic Council's report
on defense innovation adoption and new organizations like the Defense
Innovation Unit that have been created in part to augment our industrial
base.

[[More important than any new strategy]{.mark} is the [**market signal**
**to suppliers** **through meaningful contracts.**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}According to data from Govini, \$406 billion of defense
contracts were awarded to traditional defense companies while only \$4
billion was awarded to venture-backed companies last year.
[[**Contracts** are the **capitalist signal** to]{.mark} current and
future [suppliers that we need **more production** and]{.mark} **more
production [capacity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Non-traditional suppliers
like venture-backed companies can be an important part of the solution
but not if they must wait years for an antiquated Pentagon process to
develop requirements and assign contracting responsibility followed by a
multi-year budgeting process[. [The]{.mark} U.S. Army, Navy and Air
Force---who **do most of the buying** at [DoD]{.mark}---[must issue
large-scale]{.mark} and multi-year [co]{.mark}ntracts to a larger base
of suppliers if we want [to grow the defense industrial
base]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The new strategy acknowledges the increasing risk to national security
from a shrinking supplier base of six vendors who receive two-thirds of
all procurement dollars, down from 50 vendors in 1990. A key part of the
strategy is to "expand relationships with companies and technologies not
traditionally in the defense industrial base." I would go farther in
saying that [the [practical way to expand]{.mark} these [relationships
is with **production contracts** to **new entrants**, **leveraging how
capitalism works in private industry.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

While we still need to improve capacity for more traditional defense
items like munitions and weapons platforms, increasingly we must prepare
for the digital transformation on the battleground that parallels what's
happening across our economy. In fact, 11 of the 14 technologies
critical to U.S. national security, outlined by the Pentagon's CTO, are
being developed first by commercial companies rather than defense
contractors. This includes AI, cyber tools, synthetic biology, autonomy
and microelectronics where commercial demand far outstrips military
needs.

#### The Military Industrial Complex **(MIC)** is [embedded]{.underline} with the [capitalist]{.underline} relationship between the [military bureaucracy]{.underline} and the [defense industry]{.underline}.

7.1 The poly-industrial complex (PIC) with the MIC primus inter pares.

[The [MIC]{.mark} constitutes **[a variety of capitalism]{.mark}**,
understood as a form of institutional organization]{.underline}. That
institutional form was illustrated in Figure 8, [and it has now [come to
dominate **contemporary capitalism**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [At [its core
is the relationship between the military]{.mark}, related [bureaucracy,
and]{.mark} the [defense industry]{.mark}.]{.underline} Considered more
broadly, [it involves a three-sided matrixed relationship between the
military and related bureaucracy, the defense industry, and the
political sector]{.underline}. In the US, the latter is the U.S.
Congress, which is why [the MIC is sometimes also called the
**Military-Industrial-Congressional Complex**]{.underline} (MICC).29

[The MIC was the prototype of this **organizational form**, which is
[widely imitated]{.mark} so that [the economy]{.mark} is [now organized
around]{.mark} an array of [complexes]{.mark}.]{.underline} Those
include the medical industrial complex, the Wall Street financial
complex, the Big Oil complex, and the Silicon Valley technical
complex.30 Galbraith (2008) terms that form of capitalism the "Predator
State". An alternative label might be the "Poly-Industrial Complex
(PIC)" or "Poly-Industrial Congressional Complex (PICC)". Sticking with
Galbraith's colorful terminology, the label would be the
"Predator-Industrial Complex" or "Predator-Industrial-Congressional
Complex". As with the MIC, the construct of the PIC also applies to
other capitalist countries, and it too is colored by local conditions
(political, cultural, and economic).

A strength of the model described earlier in Figure 8 is [it
[**integrates politics** into]{.mark} the [economic
system]{.mark}]{.underline}[. PIC]{.mark} [capitalism is [fundamentally
a **political creation**]{.mark}, with the PIC (and especially the MIC)
being a product of the system of collective choic]{.underline}e (i.e.,
politics). Politics is "foundational", not "superstructural". It is not
an appendage sitting atop a "natural" economy. [Instead, [politics is
**embedded** in]{.mark} the making of [**the economy**]{.mark} so that
the economy is **fundamentally** a **political creation**]{.underline}.
As argued in Palley (2022b), VoC are always significantly constructed
via political actions in political spheres, and the economic ideas
informing those actions are also politically informed. That holds for
the PIC VoC, and it illustrates again why economics is better understood
as political economy.

A distinctive theoretical feature of the model is its characterization
of capitalism as a socio-economic institutional formation, which
challenges existing economic theory. The PIC and MIC bond firms and
different branches of government as one, and the public is also
supportive and involved. That institutional frame is inconsistent with
existing economic theory which benchmarks analysis by reference to an
asserted imagined ideal of a competitive market economy, which is also
ontologically impossible because many of the necessary conditions can
never be.

Instead, [the PIC formulation [sees **capitalism** as constituted by
**socially formed** complexes]{.mark}, which places the PIC (and MIC) in
opposition to existing theory's schema. [Economies]{.mark} are always
**[webbed socio-economic institutional complexes]{.mark}**. Even when
those systems are pushed to look like a market economy, behind the
scenes are rules and regulations that have been forged within the
complex.]{.underline}31 Economists emphasize the price system as the
dominant economic mechanism. The above logic suggests it is better
viewed as a subsidiary mechanism, in the sense of operating within the
system given by the PIC.

[[**The MIC**]{.mark} is first among equals for multiple reasons. First,
it spawned the organizational form that [has since]{.mark} spread and
[come to dominate **contemporary capitalism**]{.mark}. Second, as shown
earlier [in connection with]{.mark} the discussion of **[Military
Keynesianism]{.mark}**, the MIC [significantly impacts]{.mark} the level
and composition of [**economic activity.**]{.mark} It also [affects the
**rate** and **pattern** of **economic growth** because it plays]{.mark}
a **fundamental [role]{.mark}** [in shaping]{.mark} both the
**direction** and **rate** of **[technological
progress]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Third, [the MIC has multiple huge
impacts on the character of politics, the economy, and
society.]{.underline} As regards politics, its impact is most visible in
the composition of government spending, with military spending exceeding
total discretionary non-military spending. In effect, [the
MIC]{.underline} [**crowds out** social sector activities]{.underline}
government might otherwise undertake. [That crowding-out effect twists
government's character,]{.underline} what it provides, and what it
sponsors[. Since government is key to the economy,]{.underline} re both
character and composition of output, [that twisting affects the entire
economy. As regard society, [the MIC]{.mark} has [an interest in
promoting **militarism** and **national security paranoia** to
increase]{.mark} the [**demand for war**]{.mark} and war
[services]{.mark}]{.underline}. That militarism and paranoia drip [back
into back into society to implicate freedom and democracy,]{.underline}
as discussed below. Most importantly, the [[MIC **inclines** society to
war,]{.mark} with the **death** and **destruction** that brings. In the
extreme, it [potentially **threatens** ]{.mark}**the survival** of
[humanity]{.mark} owing to the existence of **nuclear
weapons.**]{.underline} Those are hugely significant aspects of the MIC
which implicate the overall character of contemporary capitalism, making
the MIC primus inter pares.

Lastly, the above observations about the economy's character speak to
weakness in the existing VoC discourse, which is in danger of becoming
narrowly economistic. Hall and Soskice (2001) focused on the
microeconomic institutional differences re the organization of firms
across polities. Since then, the discourse has abandoned that focus in
favor of a growth focus, which speaks of growth regimes characterized by
different macroeconomic determinants of growth (see Stockhammer, 2022).
Whereas the recognition of the significance of growth is welcome, the
turn to characterizing VoC in terms of growth regimes is questionable[.
Capitalism is much more than growth]{.underline}. It also [concerns the
composition of output, the character of technology and technical
progress, the character of social relations, proclivity to **military
conflict**, the character of political life and political freedoms, and
**psychological outcomes** concerning happiness, alienation, and social
solidarity.]{.underline} Framing capitalism exclusively in terms of
macroeconomic determinants of growth misses most of that. The
macroeconomic determinants of growth are also more akin to policy regime
choice variables, rather than being defining ontological characteristics
of the system. Furthermore, growth theory is highly contested, which
jeopardizes the growth regimes taxonomy.

#### The MIC supports real world neoliberalism.

The [[logic of the MIC]{.mark} -- Neoliberalism link]{.underline} is
more complicated. Here there is need to distinguish between "idealized
Neoliberalism" and "**[[real world
Neoliberalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**". Idealized Neoliberalism is
skeptical of government, which includes the MIC, and is therefore
suspicious of the MIC and inclined to limit military budgets. That
skeptical position is reflected by the Cato Institute in Washington, DC.
Real world [neoliberalism is [a **pro-corporate policy program**
]{.mark}which [aims to **weaken labor**, **increase** the **power of
business**, and increase]{.mark} the [**profit share** at the expense
of]{.mark} the [wage share]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}(Palley, 2004).
[The [defense industry]{.mark} is [**fully supportive** of that
agenda]{.mark}. [The military's position]{.mark} is a little [more
complex]{.mark}.]{.underline} On one hand, it is a governmental
organization which might make it antipathetic to Neoliberalism. That
said, [[Neoliberalism espouses]{.mark} the [**anti-Soviet** **economic
ideology**]{.mark} of the Cold war [which the **military
supports**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Additionally, [as discussed earlier,
the [military is captured by]{.mark} the defense industry via the
"[revolving door]{.mark}" system, which [also **inclines it** to support
**Neoliberalism**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[]{.mark}and became ascendant in the 1990s. It [[holds never again shall
there be a foreign power]{.underline}]{.mark}, like the former Soviet
Union, [[which can **challenge US** ]{.mark}**global
[hegemony]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The doctrine [gives the US the right
to **impose its will** anywhere in the **world,**]{.underline} including
on the borders of rivals such as Russia and China. It is formally
identified with the Project for the New American Century (PNAC) which
was launched in 1997.32 That Project sunset by 2006, whereupon it was
replaced by the Center for New American Security (CNAS) which was
founded in 2007.33 The Neocon doctrine initially seeded itself among
hardliner Republicans like Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld, and
Republicans dominated PNAC. Subsequently, it was adopted by Democrats
like Hillary Clinton and Barrack Obama, which is reflected in Democrats
dominance of CNAS. [Neoconservatism has therefore [captured **both**
major US **political parties**]{.mark}, reflecting its **hegemonic
standing.**]{.underline}34

[[**Neoliberalism** is a political **economic philosophy** that
argues]{.mark} **laissez-faire economics** is the best way to promote
individual freedom and **[economic efficiency]{.mark}**. The argument
about economic efficiency [has its roots in **19th century** **liberal
economics**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The argument about freedom was
developed by Hayek (1944) as part of a response to the political turn
toward socialism in the inter-war years. His argument was embraced with
especial enthusiasm by the US business community and its academic
allies. They saw Neoliberalism as a counter to both the Cold War
ideological threat from the Soviet Union and the threat posed by
Roosevelt's New Deal (see Burgin, 2012; Carter, 2020, Chapter 13).

[The lower triangle in Figure 10 [shows a **positive feedback
system**]{.mark} involving the MIC, Neoconservatism, and
Neoliberalism]{.underline}. [The [MIC is supportive of Neoconservatism
and Neoliberalism]{.mark}, and they are supportive of it]{.underline}.
[[The **logic** of the MIC -- Neoconservatism link is
**clear**]{.underline}.]{.mark} The [MIC is interested in providing
**war services**]{.underline}, and the [[Neocon project rests on]{.mark}
a [**permanent ramp up** of **military power**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Consequently, [they **[support each other]{.mark}'s**
interests.]{.underline} That is [reflected in the funding of
CNAS]{.underline} whose major donors [include the **major defense
contractors** such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrup Grumman, and
Raytheon.]{.underline}

The logic of the MIC -- Neoliberalism link is more complicated. Here
there is need to distinguish between "idealized Neoliberalism" and "real
world Neoliberalism". Idealized Neoliberalism is skeptical of
government, which includes the MIC, and is therefore suspicious of the
MIC and inclined to limit military budgets. That skeptical position is
reflected by the Cato Institute in Washington, DC. Real world
neoliberalism is a pro-corporate policy program which aims to weaken
labor, increase the power of business, and increase the profit share at
the expense of the wage share (Palley, 2004). The defense industry is
fully supportive of that agenda. The military's position is a little
more complex. On one hand, it is a governmental organization which might
make it antipathetic to Neoliberalism. That said, [Neoliberalism
espouses the anti-Soviet economic ideology of the Cold war which the
military supports.]{.underline} Additionally, as discussed earlier, [the
military is captured by the defense industry via the "revolving door"
system, which also inclines it to support Neoliberalism.]{.underline}

[The [same logic explains]{.mark} the [**positive feedback loop**
between Neoliberalism and Neoconservatism]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Additionally, there are [[**economic reasons** why Neoliberalism is
supportive of Neoconservatism]{.mark} and the MIC.]{.underline}
[Neoliberalism [has **driven** the push for **economic
globalization**]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}which has seen increased
trade, increased foreign real investment, increased cross-border
financial portfolio investment and financial lending, off-shoring and
foreign out-sourcing of production, and the establishment of long
international supply chains. [[Protecting those investments]{.mark},
supply chains, and trade routes [**calls for** a global **military
presence**,]{.mark} which [creates a **shared interest**]{.mark} between
the three elements of the lower triangle]{.underline}.

//reyrey edited for language

A feature [which distinguishes]{.underline} our communist parties from
other tendencies which define themselves as "socialist" is our emphasis
on **[anti-imperialist solidarity.]{.underline}**

A starting point for anyone who wants to understand imperialism is V.I.
Lenin's 1916 book Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism. In this
important work, [Lenin outlines the [**essential features** of
20th-century **imperialism** ]{.mark}as follows:]{.underline}

[[**"Free trade"**]{.mark} is [replaced by]{.mark} **huge
[monopolies]{.mark}** []{.mark}operating on a **global
scale.**]{.underline}

[[Finance capital grows]{.mark} greatly in power and
importance]{.underline}, and combines, in a dominant position, with
industrial capital.

Not just goods but [[capital i]{.mark}tself is [exported from the
**wealthy countries**]{.mark} to the poorer ones]{.underline}.

All the [poorer countries are subordinated to transnational monopoly
capital]{.underline}.

This situation creates the basis for endless wars.

For Lenin, [[imperialism]{.mark} is [**not just** a feature of
**20th-century capitalism**; it is the **proper name**]{.mark} for
20th-century capitalism itself.]{.underline}

In the 21st century, [all of this still applies with some
modifications]{.underline} (for example the wars generated by
imperialism are more between the imperialist center and the resistance
in the poorer countries).

After the triumph of the October Revolution and the rise of the USSR and
the Comintern, anti-colonial freedom movements in the colonies and "semi
colonies" (i.e., the nominally independent poorer countries)
increasingly saw communism as a source not only of ideas and inspiration
but also of material support for their struggles against the colonial
powers and the wealthy imperialist countries. This tendency increased
after the Second World War and the coming to power of communist-led,
socialist governments in the German Democratic Republic, Poland,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania.
There were new socialist revolutions first in China, then in the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Vietnam, Laos, and Cuba, as well
as strong communist-influenced or allied people's movements in many
other countries. [In response, the [leaders of the main imperialist
countries made **every effort** to **undermine**]{.mark} the [existing
socialist states]{.mark}, and to block any socialist advances in other
countries]{.underline}. As the most powerful of the imperialist states,
the United States led the way in many of these efforts.

The [[methods used]{.mark} by imperialism [to **block socialist
movements**]{.mark} and [maintain **economic** and **political control**
o]{.mark}ver the newly independent and poorer countries [have
included]{.mark}]{.underline}, and continue to include, [pouring
[**"foreign aid"** money]{.mark} into these countries in such a manner
as [to **reinforce** ]{.mark}**right-wing [oppositional
currents]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We all know about the activities of the
CIA, but U.S. agencies such as USAID, the National Endowment for
Democracy, and others also perform this function on a large scale. [The
techniques of [**imperialist hegemonic control**]{.mark} also [include
**sanctions**]{.mark} designed to \[hurt\] recalcitrant
countries]{.underline}, [[**coups d'état** and]{.underline}
**[assassinations]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [and
[even]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[direct military
intervention]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [[Imperialism has]{.mark} also
[enlisted]{.mark} the services of **[cultural institutions]{.mark}**,
literary figures, religious movements, **[the
media]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}(and right now especially the
social media[), and right-wing **labor union leaders** [in]{.mark} this
[endeavor to protect its **hegemonic
interests**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

Since the collapse of socialism in the USSR and Eastern and Central
Europe, [the [remaining socialist countries]{.mark} and the
pro-socialist people's movements [in the **global South** have faced
very **great difficulties**]{.mark}, since they **lost access** to fair
trade arrangements and material and ideological support.]{.underline}
The [neoliberal package of "free"]{.underline} (i.e., monopoly
dominated) [trade, elimination of labor and environmental protection
regulations]{.underline}, privatization of public resources of every
kind, and the imposition of austerity measures [are the prices poorer
countries are forced to pay to survive in the 21st-century economic,
political, and military environment.]{.underline}

[The [**enforcement mechanisms** of the neoliberal world order include
**trade sanctions**]{.mark} such as those the United States continues to
impose]{.underline} on socialist Cuba, "free trade" agreements such as
CAFTA-DR, and "structural adjustment" programs such as those imposed by
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank (both entities
controlled by imperialism). The [poor [countries find themselves
trapped]{.mark} in **unpayable debt**, with **dire consequences** should
they default]{.underline}. And they have to keep themselves in the good
graces of the bond rating agencies (Standard and Poor's, Moody's, Fitch)
if they are ever to be able to get development financing on the
international bond market.

Private hedge funds, such as Elliot Capital Management, buy up the
sovereign debt of poor countries at discounted prices and then try to
force those countries to pay them the full original amount. Elliot even
got a judge in Ghana to seize a ship of the Argentine Navy in an effort
to force Argentina to cooperate with such an arrangement.

The late president of Cuba, Fidel Castro, tried to get the heavily
indebted poorer countries to form a united front which would refuse to
pay the unpayable debts. Unfortunately, he was not listened to. In too
many of the poorer countries, the ruling groups are heavily, and often
corruptly, enmeshed in the imperialist project.

[Of the greatest importance is the [**predominanc**e of the **U.S.
dollar** in international trade]{.mark}. None of the poor countries can
use their own national currencies for purchasing vitally needed supplies
on the international market.]{.underline} This is because currencies
like the Cuban peso are not considered "hard currencies," and [so trade
must be carried out with U.S. dollars or very few other]{.underline}s.
[By restricting Cuban access to dollars, U.S. [imperialism has made it
extremely difficult]{.mark} for Cuba [to get such crucial things as
fuel]{.mark}, spare parts to [maintain its infrastructure, and even
medical supplies]{.mark} and equipment]{.underline}. Various efforts are
underway to challenge the trade hegemony of the dollar, including a
possible new BRICS currency. With the dynamic rise of the economy of the
People's Republic of China, it is possible that the yuan will become an
alternative hard currency.

[These are the ways in which 21st-century [imperialism harms the peoples
of the poorer countries]{.mark} around the world. But]{.underline} how
does imperialism, of which the United States is by far the biggest state
player, affect working-class people in the United States itself?

Firstly, by keeping the poorer countries poor in a world dominated by
transnational monopolies and international trade, [imperialism
[motivates]{.mark} U.S. [employers to move their **operations
overseas**]{.mark} in search of the **cheapest labor costs**
possible]{.underline}, exercising a downward pressure on wages here in
our own country.

Secondly, [the [**massive super profits**]{.mark} created by imperialism
benefit the wealthiest people in the United States, [**increasing
inequality**]{.mark} at home]{.underline}. And since wealth and power
are fungible in capitalist society, this dynamic also undermines our
limited democracy.

Thirdly, [imperialism requires vast **public expenditures** on the
military, using up resources that could and should go to meeting vital
human needs here.]{.underline}

Finally, [[this stage of capitalism is creatin]{.mark}g **multiple
[crises]{.mark}** [which harm workers]{.mark} and other ordinary folk,
both at home and abroad]{.underline}. Suffice it to mention the climate
crisis, which is very much a product of the capitalist-imperialist mode
of production.

[**struggle against imperialism**]{.mark} is [the **same a**s]{.mark}

[[Capitalism's **four-century obsession** with finding a **more
profitable route** ]{.mark}between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans [is
**finally satisfied**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [voyage]{.underline} of
the [[**Crystal Serenity** through the **Northwest Passage**
proclaimed]{.mark} the route [open for]{.mark} routine, if still risky,
**[commercial shipping]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The ship left Vancouver
on 10 August 2016, arriving in New York on 16 September. [The [Northwest
Passage **reduces the voyage by 7,000 kilometers**]{.mark} and an
average of 14 days, [compared to the **Panama Canal**]{.mark}
route]{.underline}. The Canal will eventually fall into relative disuse
-- it will become too costly and too difficult, if not impossible, to
accommodate the new increasingly gigantic ships, and often involves
queues of up to 10 days.

[Of the many who died in the search for the Passage, some were motivated
by avarice]{.underline} (huge cash prizes were offered for success),
[some by glory, and many by both]{.underline}. The most famous and
tragic effort was the 1845 expedition of Sir John Franklin -- his two
ships disappeared and 129 men died. The dream of fame and riches, which
drove so many to this usually futile and often fatal quest, has been
finally realized. [[Global warming projections estimate]{.mark} the
[passage will become an all-year route]{.mark} at the earliest by
2031]{.underline}, and at the latest by 2100. Though not the first
successful passage of ocean-going vessels (there have been an estimated
60 just since 2012, including two modest passenger ships), the Crystal
Serenity is the largest.

Cruisin' for a Climate Bruisin'

There was something disturbingly grotesque about the voyage. The
\$350-million, 820 foot-long Crystal Serenity is a veritable floating
Versailles palace. The 1070 passengers paid between \$22,000 and
\$120,000 for the luxury experience: gourmet meals, high-end boutiques,
health and beauty spas -- every imaginable entertainment. The passengers
were promised an "epic journey above the Arctic Circle" including
"quaint villages," "dramatic fjords," "calving glaciers," and even a
visit to Beechly Island, the location of some grave markers of the
Franklin expedition. Views of rare wildlife in their natural habitat
were promised: Pearly caribou, polar bear, walrus, and musk ox. Those on
this "ultimate expedition for the true explorer" would dine sumptuously
throughout the journey, but not on each other as the men of the Franklin
expedition did as starvation and death decimated their ranks.

[[**Environmentalists**, characterized]{.mark} by the captain [as those
with "big doctorates who criticize everything," **denounce**d]{.mark}
the voyage]{.underline}. [One referred to it as [**"extinction
tourism,"** since Arctic **wildlife species**]{.mark} are [at]{.mark}
imminent **[risk of disappearance]{.mark}**. O]{.underline}thers noted
the ominous implications for the future of one of the last pristine
environments left on the planet -- [such [voyages will inevitably

Whilst [the Arctic presents many challenging weather
conditions]{.underline}, as well as dangerous working conditions for
ship crew, [the opening of [new Arctic passages provides **strong
economic benefits** in terms of reduced **shipping distances**,
**times**, and **costs**]{.mark}.]{.underline} With the continued
warming of Arctic temperatures, [the **ice-free period** throughout the
Arctics]{.underline} main shipping lanes is expected to [**grow** from
30 days]{.underline} in 2010, [to 120 days]{.underline} by 2050
(Borgerson, 2009). This increase [is [ice-free period mean]{.mark}s that
more [ships can now travel through Arctic shipping
lanes]{.mark},]{.underline} creating multiple benefits. [The first
benefit is the [reduction of **travel time** and distance for ships,
increasing **supply chain efficiency**,]{.mark} and **extending shelf
life** for perishable goods, leading to a reduction of food]{.underline}
waste. This is well represented between Rotterdam and multiple major
Asian ports in Table 2:

\[Table 2 omitted\]

Additionally, the decreased [distance [allows firms to adopt a
**super-slow sailing strategy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Super slow
sailing [involves a ship decreasing its average speed]{.mark}
significantly during shipping, resulting in [a possible **100%
increase** in **energy efficiency**]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, a
ship travelling from Rotterdam to Tokyo, [can reduce its speed by 40%
going over the Arctic]{.underline} in compared to using the Suez Canal,
[[and still]{.mark} [arrive at the same time]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Schøyen & Bråthen, 2011). This results in [a [**significant reduction**
of **greenhouse gases**, as well as **fuel costs**]{.mark} for shipping
companies.]{.underline} The adoption of super-slow sailing has saved
shipping giant Maersk more than \$100 Million US Dollars (USD) since it
adapted its ships to super-slow sailing in 2007 (Vidal, 2010).

[The availability of Arctic shipping routes will [also r]{.mark}educe
the amount of [congestive **pressure**]{.mark} [on]{.mark} vital
[**choke points** in supply chains]{.mark},]{.underline} such as the
Suez Canal (17228 vessels per year), the Panama Canal (14323 vessels per
year), and the Strait of Malacca (60000 vessels per year)
(PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2011). [[Due to]{.mark} the [high quantity of
vessels]{.mark} passing through these]{.underline} [bottlenecks,
[**blockages** and]{.mark} **accidental [collisions]{.mark}** [can stall
world trade for **weeks**]{.mark}, creating massive, **unexpected
costs** and **time delays**]{.underline}. One example of this was
realized in March of 2021, when the

container ship the "Ever Given", ran aground in the Suez Canal. The Ever
Given ran aground in a vital one-way navigational section of the Suez
Canal, blocking around 430 ships from passing through the Suez Canal,
and redirecting hundreds more around the southern tip of Africa[. For
[an entire week]{.mark}, the [blockage stopped around **3% of global
trade**]{.mark}, whilst [**every additional day**]{.mark} of the
blockage [cost]{.mark} global trade around **[\$9 billion
USD]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}(Notteboom et al., 2024).

Whilst these kinds of blockages are not a regular occurrence, [the
dangers of blockages as well as the negative effects of congestion are
clear. The [Arctic sea routes provide a **cost-effective**
alternative]{.mark} which does not suffer from the same congestive
pressure, whilst **simultaneously avoiding** the **risk of blockages**
and **accidental collisions.**]{.underline}

[The Great Power **[Competition]{.mark} in the Arctic** [will be **won
with icebreakers**]{.mark}]{.underline}---highly specialized naval
vessels capable of slicing directly through polar ice that would crush
traditional ships and withstanding "storms that can ice over
superstructures until ships become so top-heavy they capsize."
Currently, complete [**[exploration]{.mark}**, shipping, and patrol of
the Arctic [is **impossible without them**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Yet,
[[there is a]{.mark} **stark [imbalance]{.mark}** among]{.underline} the
[Great Powers [in]{.mark} their **icebreaking
[capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [China]{.underline}]{.mark},
located 800 miles away from the Arctic at its closest point, operates
two existing icebreakers (with a third on the way) and [[is developing
**nuclear**]{.mark}**-powered [technology]{.mark}** for these
vessels]{.underline}. [[Russia has]{.mark} a fleet of
**[forty-six]{.mark} icebreakers**, [including]{.mark} **three
[nuclear-powered ships]{.mark}**]{.underline} for extended Arctic
patrols, [and has recently launched a new "class of combat
icebreakers]{.underline} with high-speed guns and launchers for
anti-ship and land-attack cruise missiles." [[Both]{.mark} Russia and
China have [centralized their]{.mark} icebreaker [programs
**under**]{.mark} **their [navies]{.mark}**[, underscoring]{.mark} their
view of [these **ships as military assets**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In contrast, [[America's]{.mark} **icebreaker [program]{.mark}** [is in
**disarray**. The U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}government
[[has]{.mark} only **[two]{.mark} operational
[icebreakers]{.mark}**]{.underline}---the decades-old Polar Star and the
Healy---and [[neither]{.mark} of them are [capable]{.mark} of
[year-round]{.mark} operations. [Plans to build a]{.mark} new
[fleet]{.mark} of six to nine icebreakers]{.underline}, through the
Polar Security Cutter (PSC) program, **[[are
faltering]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This joint venture between the Navy
and Coast Guard is vastly over budget and behind schedule, already
exceeding procurement cost by 39 percent, with the first delivery
expected in 2029---four years late. Unlike Russia and China, [[the U.S.
has no]{.mark} serious [plan to equip its]{.mark} developing
[icebreakers **with nuclear**]{.mark} **power**.]{.underline} Moreover,
while the Navy has some involvement in procurement and construction of
the icebreakers, [[the Coast Guard]{.mark} alone [is]{.mark}
[responsible for]{.mark} their [operations]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is
important because [the Navy is the U.S. military's forward-deployed,
combat-oriented force, while the Coast Guard is structured primarily for
homeland defense.]{.underline} This organizational divide means that
[[the]{.mark} purpose, posture, and **operational [reach]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} **America's [icebreakers]{.mark}** [are]{.mark}
**dangerously [mismatched]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}with those of
its primary adversaries in the Arctic.

[[The Need for a U.S. Navy Icebreaker Program]{.underline}]{.mark}

Accordingly, [[the U.S. Congress and the President must enact
legislation requiring the **Navy** to build and operate its own
combat-oriented **icebreaker program**]{.mark} to secure]{.underline}
our national interests in [the Arctic]{.underline}. The Navy is unlikely
to take on this role voluntarily. In 2023, the former Chief of Naval
Operations, Admiral Michael Gilday, underscored this reluctance when he
deflected questions about icebreaker procurement to the Coast Guard,
making it clear that he did not view the program as the Navy\'s
responsibility. Currently, the Coast Guard is the only branch of the
U.S. military legally tasked with "develop\[ing\], establish\[ing\],
maintain\[ing\], and operat\[ing\] icebreaking facilities." Without a
mandate, the Navy has shown no intention to expand its footprint into
the icebreaking business. Notably, Gilday's 2022 Navigation Plan, which
outlines the Navy's strategic goals through 2045, does not even
acknowledge the Arctic as a major global maritime shipping route, nor
does it identify potential geographic choke points in the region. In
2020, then-Secretary of the Navy, Kenneth Braithwaite, acknowledged the
importance of icebreakers in front of Congress, but stated that "it is
not a mission that is central to the United States Navy" and is one it
"rel\[ies\] on the Coast Guard to provide." However, [[leaving
this]{.mark} critical [program]{.mark} solely [with the Coast
Guard]{.mark}---a service with **less than 10 percent** the Navy's size
and budget---[neglects]{.mark} U.S. **[strategic interests]{.mark}** in
the Arctic.]{.underline}

[[U.S. presence in the Arctic requires a robust naval combat
capability]{.mark} which the [Coast Guard cannot
provide]{.mark}]{.underline} alone. In his 2001 commentary on the
differences between the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard, Professor Colin Gray
of the Naval War College identified three unique characteristics of the
Navy, all of which are implicated by the icebreaker program.

First, the Navy "takes its tune ... from control (even command) of the
high seas." This means the first duty of "the premier navy, is to
control sea lines of communication---to allow or deny access to the sea,
thence across it, and finally to the land, where humankind lives."
However, [without an active icebreaker presence in the
Arctic]{.underline}, [[the Navy is voluntarily denying itself]{.mark}
full access to the Arctic [leaving **gaps for** ]{.mark}**its
[adversaries]{.mark}**]{.underline}---namely [Russia and China,
**[to]{.mark} aggressively [expand]{.mark}** and militarize]{.underline}
their icebreaker presence.

Second, the Navy's commitment to "boldly go ... where great navies have
feared to sail" is undermined by its repudiation of icebreaking
operations. [[Failing to establish a]{.mark} **surface
[presence]{.mark}** [in the Arctic]{.mark} with icebreakers [could yield
an]{.mark} "asymmetric \[\] [equalizer" for
adversaries]{.mark},]{.underline} a risk that becomes more imminent
[[as]{.mark} polar ice melts and **[access]{.mark}** to the Arctic
**[increases]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Third, and most importantly, "the navy of a superpower that aspires to
protect commerce and international order globally has no responsible
choice other than to pursue excellence virtually wherever military
science takes it, however serendipitously." [Russia and China are
actively moving the **Great Power Competition** to the
**Arctic**]{.underline}: [[Russia is arming]{.mark} its [icebreakers

regularly [patrolling the Arctic]{.underline} seas [with icebreakers,
[and]{.mark} heavily [investing in **nuclear tech**]{.mark}**nology**

necessary for the Coast Guard's missions---including search and rescue,
navigation, environmental protection, interdiction, and ice
operations---[Russia and China have embraced icebreakers as dual-use
assets that]{.underline} squarely [address the Navy's
purpose]{.underline}. Moreover, the Navy and Air Force's existing
submarine and aircraft presence in the Arctic is inadequate for the
Great Power Competition. Submarines and aircraft alone cannot "clear a
path for critical shipping, respond to oil spills, or conduct maritime
safety and security boardings in the U.S. Arctic"---let alone accomplish
more strategic goals of sea control and power projection in the region.

Separately from the mission, Congress and [the President should also
[require an independent Navy icebreaker program]{.mark} due to the Coast
Guard's **ongoing struggles** in procuring and constructing the
vessels]{.underline}. This summer, the United States recently signed the
ICE Pact with Finland and Canada to build seventy to ninety new
icebreakers over the next decade. While this agreement will help expand
America's icebreaker fleet, it relies on Finland---which can build a
polar-class vessel in two years at just 25 percent of the cost of in
America---to handle construction. [This outsourcing is, frankly, an
**embarrassment**]{.underline}. The poor outcomes in the PSC program may
stem in part from its joint structure: since the Coast Guard operates
the icebreakers, the PSC program lacks the Navy's full commitment. The
Navy hasn't fully leveraged its size, money, expertise and influence to
drive efficiency or accelerate progress of the program, while the Coast
Guard remains constrained by the Navy's budget authority. Furthermore,
each service can deflect blame onto the other in congressional oversight
hearings, complicating accountability for the program's setbacks.

[[Shipping is a **fundamental industry**, supporting]{.mark} society as
we know it, representing [**trillions of dollars** in **annual trade**,
and]{.mark} a[ccounting for transport of]{.mark} nearly [**90%** of
**all goods globally**]{.mark}]{.underline}[1]{.mark} . Shipping through
Canadian Arctic waters is of [[particular interest globally due to the
potential of the **Northwest Passage** (]{.mark}NWP)]{.underline}
(Fig. 1) emerging [as [a **viable**, **shorter**, and potentially **more
economical** alternative to traditional shipping routes]{.underline}
]{.mark}[connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans]{.underline} (i.e.,
Panama and Suez Canals). Global conflict involving Russia at this time
has also increased pressure on the NWP as some [nations may be
**reluctant** to utilise or consider the near-term future utilisation of
the **N**orthern **S**ea **R**oute]{.underline}. The NWP comprises of a
southern shallow water route which passes to the south of Victoria
Island, and the northern deep-water route which extends through the
Parry Channel (Fig. 1). Both routes share the same eastern entrance
(western exit) to (from) the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) through
Lancaster Sound. Currently, the majority of ships (97%) use the southern
route of the NWP2 (Fig. 1), but the northern route is shorter and
considered more efficient and thus is of most interest for commercial
and transit-based operations. Although fog is a significant hazard to
navigation of either route3,4 , [[sea ice]{.mark} has been [the primary
obstacle to **timely navigation**]{.mark} through the NWP. [**Sea
ice**]{.mark} in the Arctic [has experienced considerable
declines]{.mark}]{.underline} over the satellite record, particularly in
the summer months5 . In the Canadian Arctic, [sea ice area has declined
by [5--20% per decade]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}(depending on the
region) between 1968 and 20166 . Associated with the recent decline in
sea ice, the number of voyages taken by vessels has quadrupled since
1990 across the Canadian Arctic2,7 . Accordingly[, [**increased ship
navigability** in the Canadian Arctic is projected to continue]{.mark}
in the upcoming decades,]{.underline} associated with the gradual loss
of sea ice8--13.as well as other shifting socio-economic drivers.
Complicatingfuture projections of the likelihood of increased
navigability in the NWP is that the latest state-of-the-art climate
models have difficulty capturing local-scale ice dynamics within the
narrow channels of the CAA11,14,15. This is particularly important to
[[vessels transiting the NWP]{.underline}]{.mark}, as they [become
[susceptible to]{.mark} the southward [flow of **thick MYI** from the
Arctic Ocean]{.mark}]{.underline}[16]{.mark},17 a process that [has
increased as a result of climate change]{.underline}18--20. The origin
of this thick MYI is The Last Ice Area (LIA) located to the north of the
CAA and Greenland21 and is the thickest in the Arctic22--24. [While its
character is [not as robust as]{.mark} it was
[historically]{.mark}25,26, this [ice is still]{.mark} **expected to be
[present ]{.mark}**[even]{.mark} when the rest of the Arctic Ocean is
sea ice free [during the summer]{.mark} months]{.underline}14,27 and
will continue to flow southward into the channels of the NWP28. It is
also worth emphasising that the relationship between declining sea ice
and increased shipping activity is not solely driven by physical changes
in sea ice but that economic drivers such as natural resource
extraction, global commodity prices, and other socio-economic
factors7,29,30 also play a role. As a result, future changes in shipping
will not solely be based on sea ice presence/absence but also by
strategic and marketing considerations -- that is, [[sea ice
conditions]{.mark} will not drive future shipping traffic but,
**[foundationally]{.mark}** it could certainly [enable or prevent
it.]{.mark}]{.underline}

A short fuse is burning. [At the [**present rate** of]{.mark} global
[emissions]{.mark}, the world is projected to]{.underline} reach the

dangerous climate change]{.underline} that could well prove
[irreversible, affecting the climate for centuries]{.underline} if not

carbon dioxide at the present]{.underline} moment, the [extra carbon
already accumulated in the atmosphere **virtually guarantees** that
climate change will **continue**]{.underline} with damaging effects to
the human species and life in general. However, [reaching the 2°C
increase]{.underline} in global average temperature guardrail,
associated with a level of carbon concentration in the environment of
450 ppm, would lead to a qualitatively different condition. At that
point, [climate feedbacks would increasingly come into play threatening
to catapult global average temperatures]{.underline} to 3°C or 4°C above
preindustrial levels within this century, in the lifetime of many
individuals alive today. The situation is only made more serious by the
emission of other greenhouse gases, including methane and nitrous oxide.

The enormous [[dangers]{.mark} that **rapid** [c]{.mark}limate
[c]{.mark}hange [present]{.mark} to humanity]{.underline} as a whole,
and the [[**inability** of]{.mark} the existing **[capitalist]{.mark}**
political-economic [structure to address them]{.mark}]{.underline},
symbolized by the presence of Donald Trump in the White House, have
engendered a [desperate search for technofixes in the form of schemes
for **[geoengineering]{.mark}**]{.underline}, defined as [massive,
[deliberate human interventions to manipulate]{.mark} the entire
[climate]{.mark}]{.underline} or the planet as a whole.

Not only is [geoengineering now being enthusiastically pushed by today's
**billionaire** class]{.underline}, as represented by figures like Bill
Gates and Richard Branson; by environmental organizations such as the
Environmental Defense Fund and the Natural Resources Defense Council; by
think tanks like the Breakthrough Institute and Climate Code Red; [and
by fossil-fuel corporations]{.underline} like Exxon Mobil and Shell---it
is also being actively pursued by the governments of the United States,
the United Kingdom, China, and Russia. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) has incorporated negative emissions strategies
based on geoengineering (in the form of Bio-energy with Carbon Capture
and Storage, or BECCS) into nearly all of its climate models. Even some
figures on the political left (where "accelerationist" ideas have
recently taken hold in some quarters) have grabbed uncritically onto
[geoengineering as [a **deus ex machina**]{.mark}---a way of defending
an ecomodernist economic and technological strategy]{.underline}---as
witnessed by a number of contributions to Jacobin magazine's Summer 2017
Earth, Wind, and Fire issue.2

If the Earth System is to avoid 450 ppm of carbon concentration in the
atmosphere and is to return to the Holocene average of 350 ppm, some
negative emissions by technological means, and hence geoengineering on
at least a limited scale, will be required, according to leading
climatologist James Hansen.3 Hansen's strategy, however, like most
others, remains based on the current system, that is, it excludes the
possibility of a full-scale ecological revolution, involving the
self-mobilization of the population around production and consumption.
What remains certain is that [[any attempt to implement]{.mark}
**geoengineering** (even in the form of technological schemes for carbon
removal) [as]{.mark} the [dominant]{.mark} [strategy]{.mark} for
addressing global warming, [**subordinated** to]{.mark} the ends of
**[capital accumulation]{.mark}**, would [prove **fatal**]{.mark} to

own, are so great that the [[only rational course is]{.mark} a long
**[ecological revolution]{.mark}**]{.underline} aimed at the most rapid
possible reduction in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions,
[coupled with an emphasis on agroecology and restoration of global
ecosystems]{.underline}, including forests, to absorb carbon dioxide.4
This would need to be [accompanied by a far-reaching [reconstitution of
society]{.mark} at large]{.underline}, aimed at the
[[reinstitution]{.underline}]{.mark} on a higher [level of [collective
and egalitarian practices]{.mark}]{.underline} that were [undermined by
the rise of capitalism]{.underline}.

Geoengineering the Planet Under the Regime of Fossil Capital

Geoengineering as an idea dates back to the period of the first
discoveries of rapid anthropogenic climate change. Beginning in the
early 1960s, the Soviet Union's (and at that time the world's) leading
climatologist, Mikhail Budyko, was the first to issue a number of
warnings on the inevitably of accelerated global climate change in the
case of industrial systems based on the burning of fossil fuels.5
Although anthropogenic climate change had long been recognized, what was
new was the discovery of major climate feedbacks such as the melting of
Arctic ice and the disruption of the albedo effect as reflective white
ice was replaced with blue seawater, increasing the amount of solar
radiation absorbed by the planet and ratcheting up global average
temperature. In 1974, Budyko offered, as a possible solution to climate
change, the use of high-flying planes to release sulfur particles
(forming sulfate aerosols) into the stratosphere. This was meant to
mimic the role played by volcanic action in propelling sulfur into the
atmosphere, thus creating a partial barrier, limiting incoming solar
radiation. The [rationale]{.underline} he offered was [that capitalist
economies]{.underline}, in particular, would [not be able to curtail
capital-accumulation-based growth]{.underline}, energy use, [and
emissions, despite the danger to the climate]{.underline}.6
[Consequently, technological alternatives to stabilize the climate would
have to be explored]{.underline}. But it was not until 1977 when the
Italian physicist Cesare Marchetti proposed a scheme for capturing
carbon dioxide emissions from electrical power plants and using pipes to
sequester them in the ocean depths that the word "geoengineering" itself
was to appear.7

Budyko's pioneering proposal to use sulfur particles to block a part of
the sun's rays, now known as "stratospheric aerosol injection," and
Marchetti's early notion of capturing and sequestering carbon in the
ocean, stand for the two main general approaches to
geoengineering---respectively, solar radiation management (SRM) and
carbon dioxide removal (CDR). SRM is designed to limit the solar
radiation reaching the earth. CDR seeks to capture and remove carbon to
decrease the amount entering the atmosphere.

Besides stratospheric aerosol injection, first proposed by Budyko,
another approach to SRM that has gained influential adherents in recent
years is **[marine cloud brightening]{.underline}**. This would involve
cooling the earth by modifying low-lying, stratocumulus clouds covering
around a third of the ocean, making them more reflective. In the
standard scenario, a special fleet of 1,500 unmanned,
satellite-controlled ships would roam the ocean spraying submicron drops
of seawater in the air, which would evaporate leaving salty residues.
These bright salt particles would reflect incoming solar radiation. They
would also act as cloud condensation nuclei, increasing the surface area
of the clouds, with the result that more solar radiation would be
reflected.

Both stratospheric aerosol injection and [**[marine cloud
brightening]{.mark}** are widely criticized as [posing **enormous
hazards**]{.mark} on top of climate change itself]{.underline}, while
[simply [addressing]{.mark} the [symptoms not]{.mark} the [cause]{.mark}
of climate change]{.underline}. Stratospheric aerosol injection---to be
delivered to the stratosphere by means of hoses, cannons, balloons, or
planes---would alter the global hydrological cycle with enormous
unpredictable effects, likely leading to massive droughts in major
regions of the planet. It is feared that it could shut down the Indian
monsoon system disrupting agriculture for as many as 2 billion people.8
There are also worries that it might affect photosynthesis and crop
production over much of the globe.9 The injection of sulfur particles
into the atmosphere could contribute to depletion of the ozone layer.10
Much of the extra sulfur would end up dropping to the earth, leading to
acid rain.11 Most worrisome of all, stratospheric aerosol injection
would have to be repeated year after year. At termination the rise in
temperature associated with additional carbon buildup would come almost
at once with world temperature conceivably rising by 2--3°C in a
decade---a phenomenon referred to as the "termination problem."12

As with stratospheric aerosol injection, [marine cloud brightening would
[drastically affect]{.mark} the [hydrological cycle]{.mark} in
unpredictable ways]{.underline}. For example, it could
[[generate]{.mark} a [severe drought]{.mark} in the Amazon, drying up
the world's most vital terrestrial ecosystem]{.underline} with
[incalculable and [**catastrophic** effects]{.mark} for Earth System
stability]{.underline}.13 Many of the dangers of cloud brightening are
similar to those of stratospheric aerosol depletion. Like other forms of
SRM, [it would do [nothing to stop ocean
acidification]{.mark}]{.underline} caused by rising carbon dioxide
levels.

The first form of CDR to attract significant attention from economic
interests and investors was the idea of fertilizing the ocean with iron,
thereby boosting the growth of phytoplankton so as to promote greater
ocean uptake of carbon. There have been a dozen experiments in this area
and the difficulties attending this scheme have proven to be legion. The
effects on the ecological cycles of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and a
host of other marine species all the way up to whales at the top of the
food chain are indeterminate. Although some parts of the ocean would
become greener due to the additional iron, other parts would become
bluer, more devoid of life, because they would be deprived of the
nutrients---nitrate, phosphorus, and silica---needed for growth.14
Evidence suggests that the vast portion of the carbon taken in by the
ocean would stay on the surface or the intermediate levels of the ocean,
with only a tiny part entering the ocean depths, where it would be
naturally sequestered.15

Among the various CDR schemas, it is BECCS, because of its promise of
negative emissions, which today is attracting the most support. This is
because it seems to allow nations to overshoot climate targets on the
basis that the carbon can be removed from the atmosphere decades later.
Although BECCS exists at present largely as an untested computer model,
it is now incorporated into almost all climate models utilized by the
IPCC.16 As modeled, BECCS would burn cultivated crops in order to
generate electricity, with the capture and underground storage of the
resulting carbon dioxide. In theory, since plant crops can be seen as
carbon neutral---taking carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and then
eventually releasing it again---BECCS, by burning biomass and then
capturing and sequestering the resulting carbon emissions, would be a
means of generating electricity while at the same time resulting in a
net reduction of atmospheric carbon.

BECCS, however, comes into question the moment one moves from the
abstract to the concrete. The IPCC's median-level models are projected
to remove 630 gigatons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, around two
thirds of the total emitted between the Industrial Revolution and
2011.17 This would occur on vast crop plantations to be run by
agribusiness. To remove a trillion tons of carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere as envisioned in the more ambitious scenarios would take up a
land twice the size of India (or equal to Australia), about half as much
land as currently farmed globally, requiring a supply of freshwater
equal to current total global agricultural usage.18 The costs of
implementing BECCS on the imagined scales have been estimated by
climatologist James Hansen---who critically notes that negative
emissions have "spread like a cancer" in the IPCC climate models---to be
on the order of hundreds of trillions of dollars, with "minimal
estimated costs" ranging as high as \$570 trillion this century.19 The
effects of BECCS---used as a primary mechanism and designed to avoid
confrontation with the present system of production---would therefore be
a massive displacement of small farmers and global food production.

Moreover, the notion that the forms of large-scale, commercial
agricultural production presumed in BECCS models would be carbon neutral
and would thus result in negative emissions with sequestration has been
shown to be exaggerated or false when the larger effects on global land
use are taken into account. BECCS crop cultivation is expected to take
place on vast monoculture plantations, displacing other forms of land
use. Yet, biologically diverse ecosystems have substantially higher
rates of carbon sequestration in soil and biomass than does monocrop
agriculture.20 An alternative to BECCS in promoting carbon sequestration
would be to promote massive, planetary ecological restoration, including
reforestation, together with the promotion of agroecology modeled on
traditional forms of agriculture organized around nutrient recycling and
improved soil management methods.21 This would avoid the metabolic rift
associated with agribusiness monocultures, which are less efficient both
in terms of food production per hectare and carbon sequestration.

Another commonly advocated technofix, carbon capture and sequestration
(CCS), is not strictly a form of geoengineering since it is directed at
capturing and sequestering carbon emissions of particular electrical
plants, such as coal-fired power plants. However, the [promotion of a
CCS infrastructure]{.underline} on a planetary scale [as a means of
addressing climate change]{.underline}---thereby [skirting the necessity
of an ecological revolution]{.underline} in production and
consumption---is best seen as a form of planetary geoengineering due to
its immense projected economic and ecological scale. Although CCS would
theoretically allow the burning of fossil fuels from electrical power
plants with no carbon emissions into the atmosphere, the scale and the
costs of CCS operations are prohibitive. As Clive Hamilton writes in
Earthmasters: The Dawn of the Age of Climate Engineering, CCS for a
single "standard-sized 1,000 megawatt coal-fired plant....would need 30
kilometers of air-sucking machinery and six chemical plants, with a
footprint of 6 square kilometers."22 Energy expert Vaclav Smil has
calculated that, "in order to sequester just a fifth of current \[2010\]
CO2 emissions we would have to create an entirely new worldwide
absorption-gathering-compression-transportation-storage industry whose
annual throughput would have to be about 70 percent larger than the
annual volume now handled by the global crude oil industry, whose
immense infrastructure of wells, pipelines, compressor stations and
storage took generations to build."23 Capturing and sequestering current
U.S. carbon dioxide emissions would require 130 billion tons of water
per year, equal to about half the annual flow of the Columbia River.
This new gigantic infrastructure would be placed on top of the current
fossil fuel infrastructure---[[all in order to allow for]{.mark} the
**[continued]{.mark}** burning of [fossil fuels]{.mark}]{.underline}.24

A Planetary Precautionary Principle for the Anthropocene

If [today's planetary ecological emergency is a product of centuries of
war on the planet as a mechanism of capital accumulation, fossil-capital
generated [geoengineering]{.mark} schemes can be seen as gargantuan
projects for **[keep]{.mark}ing [the system going]{.mark}**]{.underline}
by carrying this war to its ultimate level. [[Geoengineering
under]{.mark} the [present regime of accumulation]{.mark}]{.underline}
has the [sole objective of keeping the status quo
intact]{.underline}---[neither disturbing the dominant relations of
capitalist production nor even seeking so much as to overturn the
fossil-fuel industry]{.underline} with which capital is deeply
intertwined. [Profits, production, and overcoming energy
poverty]{.underline} in the poorer parts of the world thus [become
justifications for keeping the present fossil-capital system going,
[maintaining at all cost]{.mark} the [existing capitalist]{.mark}
environmental [regime]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Promethean mentality
behind this is well captured by a question that Rex Tillerson then CEO
of Exxon Mobil Corporation asked---without a trace of irony---at an
annual shareholders meeting in 2013[: "What good is it to save the
planet if humanity suffers?"]{.underline}25

The whole [history of ecological crisis]{.underline} leading up the
[present planetary emergency]{.underline}, punctuated by numerous
disasters---from the near total destruction of the ozone layer, to
nutrient loading and the spread of dead zones in the ocean, to climate
change itself---serves to [highlight the [march of folly associated
with]{.mark} any [attempt to engineer]{.mark} the [entire
planet]{.mark}]{.underline}. The complexity of the Earth System
guarantees that enormous unforeseen consequences would emerge. As
Frederick Engels warned in the nineteenth century, "Let us not...flatter
ourselves overmuch on account of our [human victories over
nature]{.underline}. For each such victory nature takes its revenge on
us. [Each victory]{.underline}, it is true, [[in the first place brings
about]{.mark} the [results we expected, but]{.mark} in the [second and
third places]{.mark} it [has]{.mark}]{.underline} quite different,
[[unforeseen effects]{.mark} which]{.underline} only too often [[cancel
the first]{.underline}]{.mark}."26

In the face of uncertainty, coupled with an extremely high likelihood of
inflicting [incalculable harm on the Earth System]{.underline}, it is
essential to [invoke what is known as the Precautionary Principle
whenever the question of planetary geoengineering is
raised]{.underline}. As ecological economist Paul Burkett has explained,
the strong version of the Precautionary Principle, necessarily
encompasses the following:

\(1\) The Precautionary Principle Proper, which says that if an action
may cause serious harm, there is a case for counteracting measures to
ensure that the action does not take place.

\(2\) The Principle of Reverse Onus, under which it is the
responsibility of those supporting an action to show that it is not
seriously harmful, thereby shifting the burden of proof off those
potentially harmed by the action (e.g. the general population and other
species occupying the environment). In short, it is safety, rather than
potential harm, that needs to be demonstrated.

\(3\) The Principle of Alternative Assessment, stipulating that no
potentially harmful action will be undertaken if there are alternative
actions available that safely achieve the same goals as the action
proposed.

\(4\) All societal deliberations bearing on the application of features
1 through 3 must be open, informed, and democratic, and must include all
affected parties.27

It is clear that [geoengineering promoted in a context of a capitalist
regime of maximum accumulation would be ruled out completely by a strong
Precautionary Principle]{.underline} based on each of the criteria
listed above. There is a [near certainty of extreme damage to the human
species as a whole arising from all of the major geoengineering
proposals]{.underline}. [If the onus were placed on status quo
proponents of capitalist geoengineering to demonstrate that great harm
to the planet as a place of human habitation would not be inflicted,
such proposals would **fail the test**.]{.underline} Since the
alternative of not burning fossil fuels and promoting alternative forms
of energy is entirely feasible, while planetary geoengineering carries
with it immense added dangers for the Earth System as a whole, such a
technofix as a primary means of checking global warming would be
excluded by that criterion, too. Finally, [geoengineering under the
present economic and social system invariably involves some entity from
the power structure]{.underline}---a single multi-billionaire, a
corporation, a government, or an international
organization---[implementing such action ostensibly on behalf of
humanity as a whole, while leaving most affected parties worldwide out
of the decision-making process]{.underline}, with hundreds of millions,
perhaps billions, of people paying the environmental costs, often with
their lives. In short, [[geoengineering]{.mark}, particularly if
subordinated to the capital accumulation process,
[violates]{.mark}]{.underline} the most sacred version of the
Precautionary Principle, dating back to antiquity: [[First Do No
Harm]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Since the 2015 UN Paris Agreement, [climate
[geoengineering]{.mark}]{.underline} -- the intentional large-scale
manipulation of the earth's natural systems -- has shifted from the
margins to the mainstream of climate policy discussions. The idea counts
[among its [supporters both]{.mark} **liberal [technocrats]{.mark}**
[and **neoconservatives**]{.mark}]{.underline} like U.S. Rep. Lamar
Smith, a [notorious climate denier]{.underline} who [[sees]{.mark}
geoengineering [as]{.mark} an [alt]{.mark}ernative [to]{.mark} "forcing
unworkable and [**costly**]{.mark} government [mandates]{.mark} on the
American people."]{.underline} Geoengineering has also found a supporter
in Jacobin editorial board member Peter Frase. In an article from the
"Earth, Wind, and Fire" issue, Frase raises the "prospect of
geoengineering in a left context...as part of a larger portrait of
eco-socialism" -- calling on leftists to embrace geoengineering as part
of a "realistic and appealing" vision of a better world in the future.
Frase is [correct to call for a [vision of eco]{.mark}logical
[reconstruction]{.mark} along [socialist lines]{.mark}]{.underline}. But
his [[notion that]{.underline}]{.mark} geoengineering would benefit
society -- or, more strangely, that [[support]{.mark} for geoengineering
will [win working-class]{.mark} people [to]{.mark} the [socialist
project]{.mark} -- [is]{.mark} as politically [naive]{.mark} as it is
under-researched.]{.underline} Far from bringing about an ecological
transition, [[allowing]{.mark} the **[ruling class]{.mark}** to gain
[control of]{.mark} the [global thermostat]{.mark}]{.underline} would
more likely [[result in]{.mark} new commodity frontiers and [capitalist
expansion]{.mark}]{.underline}, along with the [development of [new
**weapons**]{.mark} to be used [against opponents of
**empire**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [as the US attempted in
**[Vietnam]{.mark}** through [weather modification]{.mark}]{.underline}.
A review of the most [prominent geoengineering technologies reveals that
the [impacts of deployment]{.mark} would **disproportionately** [fall
on]{.mark} peasant and poor communities in the **[Global
South]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Socialist support for geoengineering would
be a [striking reversal for a political tradition based on international
**solidarity** with the **oppressed** and **exploited**.]{.underline}
Geoengineering is generally broken into two categories:
[**[tech]{.mark}nologies** [aiming to block or reflect
**sunlight**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and those that would suck carbon out
of the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide removal builds on the neoliberal logic
of carbon markets -- mobilizing resources for projects intended to
function as "carbon sinks". Climate finance is already supporting
monoculture tree plantations for carbon sequestration, which erode
biodiversity and soil health, deplete groundwater, and incentivize land
grabs. Other proposals range from dumping iron filings into the ocean to
stimulate algae blooms, to carbon capture and storage projects like the
Kemper County coal plant in Mississippi -- a \$7 billion boondoggle
which soaked up over \$1 billion in government and ratepayer funding
before being forced to burn natural gas and abandon CCS. The most
prominent CDR technology is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage
(BECCS) -- an idea that is expected to be central to the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's special report on achieving
1.5°C due out shortly. In order for BECCS to achieve the emissions
targets laid out in the Paris Agreement, 25 to 80 percent of total
current global cropland, or up to eight percent of the earth's land
area, would need to be dedicated to bioenergy production. BECCS faces
potentially insurmountable hurdles to commercial-scale deployment. But
even the hype alone is likely to generate speculative investment in
arable land, accelerating a land grab that has led to the dispossession
and proletarianization of peasant and Indigenous communities in South
America, Africa, and Southeast Asia since the financial crisis of 2008.
While organizations like the Landless Workers' Movement (MST) in Brazil
and COPINH in Honduras are leading courageous struggles for Indigenous
land rights and popular agrarian reform, land defenders often face
severe repression and criminalization. US and European leftists should
be aiming to build links of solidarity with these movements, rather than
providing support, if indirect, for the reactionary forces arrayed
against them. While liberals line up behind carbon markets and CDR,
neoconservatives see solar radiation management as an opportunity to
continue with capitalist business as usual, and if necessary, hire
Halliburton to dim the sky. Strengthening ties with movements fighting
to defend territory from the carbon commodity frontier, on the other
hand, will require [rejecting mindless faith in technology with concrete
strategy that recognizes peasants and landless rural workers as key
players in an international **anti-capitalist** historic
bloc.]{.underline} In its most prominent form, [SRM]{.underline}
involves spraying sulfur into the upper atmosphere to shade out incoming
sunlight -- a [practice that would have to be repeated indefinitely to
avoid a catastrophic spike in global temperatures]{.underline} once the
sulfur shade dissipated. Models predict that [[**SRM**
deployment]{.mark} would alter global precipitation patterns, [shifting
**monsoons**]{.mark} critical to millions of people across Africa and
South Asia or [exacerbating **drought**]{.mark} in the Sahel region of
Africa]{.underline}. Geoengineering is currently prohibited under a de
facto UN moratorium. But the possibility of unilateral action by the US
or another superpower [should [compel]{.mark} leftists and [all
opponents of imperialism]{.mark} to [fight for]{.mark} an immediate [ban
on solar]{.mark} radiation [management]{.mark}]{.underline}, given the
risks. Strengthening ties with movements [fighting to defend territory
from the carbon commodity frontier]{.underline}, on the other hand, will
[[require **rejecting**]{.mark} [mindless faith in
**tech**]{.mark}**nology** with concrete strategy that
[recognizes]{.mark} peasants and landless rural [workers]{.mark} as
[key]{.mark} players [in]{.mark} an international
**[anti-cap]{.mark}italist** historic [bloc]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Leftists should [welcome the opportunity to [debate **real**
solutions]{.mark} to climate change]{.underline}. As Jacobin editor
Alyssa Battistoni points out, ["\[c\]limate change]{.underline} more
than any other issue [demonstrates the [need for
**socialism**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It points to the need for more
democratic political control over industry, technology, and
infrastructure; [more conscious intention about how we build our
world]{.underline}, why, and for whom." [Climate
**[geoengineering]{.mark}**]{.underline}, on the other hand,
[[is]{.mark} science-fiction [fantasy bankrolled by]{.mark} the [ruling
class]{.mark} -- a project [to be]{.mark} roundly [**rejected**
by]{.mark} all [those committed to **social justice**]{.mark} and a
[**livable** planet]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Geoengineering is a techno-utopian tool designed to maintain the "good Anthropocene"; a political imaginary defined by necro-ecological capitalism.

The Anthropocene is proving to be an era of world war, or rather, worlds
at war. Not that this is anything new. We are no doubt living in the
continuation of longstanding onto-epistemological and politico-military
conflicts set within (still unfolding) histories of colonial and global
states of violence and dispossession. If catastrophe lies before us,
then it flows from what's come before. Consider two ideological
formations that speak to our current situation. First[,
[geoengineering's **techno-utopianism**]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is
premised on [[c]{.mark}limate-[c]{.mark}hange [fixes for]{.mark} the
[symptoms of fossil capital's]{.mark} centuries-long [effect on]{.mark}
the [environment]{.mark}]{.underline}. Adherents [[suggest]{.mark} that
solar radiation management and [carbon capture]{.mark} can stabilize
temperatures]{.underline} so as to [[avert calamitous]{.mark}
environmental [transformation]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Breakthrough
Institute offers a [[futurist vision of]{.mark} the **["good
Anthropocene,"]{.mark}**]{.underline} articulated as a coming [world
where "[humans use]{.mark} their growing social, economic, and
[tech]{.mark}nological powers to make life better for people,
[stabilize]{.mark} the [climate]{.mark}, and protect the natural
world."]{.underline} 1 The second formation we should consider is the
tragic and redemptive Afrofuturism appearing in Arthur Jafa's shattering
2016 video Love is the Message, the Message is Death. As one model among
numerous [Indigenous and anticolonial futurisms embedded within social
movements dedicated to justice-to-come, it foregrounds the heartrending
violence of the present as the fundamental basis upon which any
alternative -- one of coexistence, equality, love, and peace -- can be
imagined.]{.underline} Following the impulses behind the 2016 Movement
for Black Lives Platform, which built on longstanding African-American
approaches to environmental justice, it is [crucial to bring these
politico-ecological strands together in intersectional
analysis.]{.underline} 2 The above two modelings of the future offer an
expedient [comparison between the current technoscientific rationality
of climate-change response and the social in/justice concerns around
racial capitalism]{.underline}. It invites a [much-needed discussion of
futures]{.underline} that could potentially be locked in for hundreds,
even thousands of years, especially in light of the fact that
[[technocratic]{.mark} climate [science]{.mark} tends to
[ignore]{.mark}]{.underline}, or, at best, merely pays lip service to
[the differential [impacts]{.mark} of environmental transformations
[on]{.mark} disenfranchised [communities subject to ongoing]{.mark}
racial and economic [discrimination]{.mark}]{.underline}, and that
social justice activism also tends to shunt ecological matters to the
side due to an all-too immediate confrontation with police brutality.
Jafa, a filmmaker by trade, unleashes an archive of citizen-journalist,
dash cam, and media videos through which the black body is subjected to
police brutality and other forms of violence. Set to (the artist
formerly named) Kanye West's transcendent gospel-rap anthem "Ultralight
Beam," the video quickly cycles through recent and historical footage,
intermixing clips of horrific, civilization destroying aliens from
Hollywood films. It would appear that Jafa proposes an allegory for the
destruction of the world that, in a parallel universe, geoengineering
wishes to repair. My 2017 book Against the Anthropocene similarly
criticizes the [Anthropocene thesis for its regressive and narcissistic
**[neo-humanism]{.mark}**, its [evasion of]{.mark} the differential
causes and effects of climate breakdown]{.underline}, its [disavowal of
[**petrocapitalist** culpability]{.mark}]{.underline}, and its ecology
of affluence. 3 That analysis extended to diverse visual-cultural
expressions of remote sensing data, the kind that offers "whole earth"
perspectives of the planet as not only devoid of social conflict but
also safely in the grips of an emergent scientific mastery. These
observations still plague theories, and the unfolding reception, of the
Anthropocene today -- despite parallel attempts to mobilize it
critically, work progressively with its conceptualization, and also
nominate additional terms to better comprehend current conditions, such
as the Chthulucene or the Capitalocene. 4 While Jafa's video powerfully
elucidates the problems with this formation -- dramatizing the extreme
costs of the social asymmetries that go unaddressed within engineering
-- the last couple of years have shown us, with increasing clarity, that
[the [neoliberalization of the Anthropocene]{.mark}]{.underline} is
ascendant. The growth in [**climate engineering** theory and practice
and its [status-conserving technofixes]{.mark} **threaten** a future
grounded in social justice. [**Geoengineering** unfolds **directly**
from]{.mark} the [**Anthropocene** thesis]{.mark},]{.underline}
beginning with the initial 2000 proposal made by atmospheric chemist
Paul Crutzen and biologist Eugene Stoermer to designate a new geological
era where Earth systems are increasingly determined by "human
activities." As they explained, "an exciting, but also difficult and
daunting task lies ahead of the global research and engineering
community to guide man-kind towards global, sustainable, environmental
management." 5 Crutzen soon followed up with more explicit suggestions
that [large-scale engineering projects]{.underline}, including his own
one for stratospheric sulfur injections, may well be [necessary to
["optimize"]{.mark} the [climate]{.mark}]{.underline}. 6 Much dispute
remains over the dating of this post-Holocene epoch: whether it began
with the nineteenth-century industrial revolution, or nuclear science in
the 1940s, or again much earlier with the Orbis Spike of 1610. The
latter coincides with the geological implications of colonization and
genocide in the Americas, which also unknowingly dropped atmospheric
carbon levels thanks to large-scale afforestation of once-cultivated
Indigenous lands. 7 Its apparently causal connection to geoengineering
shows that the Anthropocene is not only far from innocent in historical
diagnosis (it matters both geologically and politically when we date
it), but preemptive in techno-scientific prescription for future
response. Essentially, by interpreting the past, we determine the
future. For Crutzen, engineering may be a last resort to forestall
catastrophic breakdown, where reducing emissions proves insurmountable;
for others, it represents an attractive first option to [advance
[ecological modernization]{.mark}, [merging climate solutions with
**econ**]{.mark}**omic [opportunity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This becomes
explicit with The Breakthrough Institute's notorious proposal for a
[good Anthropocene]{.underline}, founded on the [[**dubious
"decoupling"**]{.mark} of economic growth from environmental
impacts]{.underline}. 8 This "leading big money, anti-green,
pro-nuclear" -- and pro-geoengineering -- "think tank in the United
States" was founded in 2003 by Michael Shellenberger and Ted Nordhaus.
In their 2004 essay "The Death of Environmentalism: Global Warming
Politics in a Post-Environmental World," Shellenberger and Nordhaus
sought to dispatch what they termed the "politics of limits" -- the kind
based in the regulatory environmentalism of the 1970s emphasizing
Earth's finite carrying capacity -- and replace it with a ["politics of
possibility"]{.underline} dedicated to [technologically-driven economic
growth]{.underline}. 9 They count Carl Page, brother of Google founder
Larry Page, among its funders, indicating the [growing convergence of
Big Tech with green economics]{.underline}. According to critics, The
Institute remains singularly "dedicated to [[propagandizing capitalist
tech]{.mark}nological investment **['solutions']{.mark}** to climate
change]{.underline}." 10 The clearest articulation of the Institute's
position is "An Ecomodernist Manifesto," written by eighteen authors
including Shellenberger and Nordhaus. It advances this techno-solutions
based goal: "More-productive economies are wealthier economies, capable
of better meeting human needs while committing more of their economic
surplus to non-economic amenities, including better human health,
greater human freedom and opportunity, arts, culture, and the
conservation of nature." 11 Despite its familiar trickle-down economics
and liberal-coated goodwill, the Manifesto's expansive spatiotemporal
scales and abstract rhetoric, like much of the Anthropocene's planetary
imagery and deep time frame, overshoot the figural, the actual, the
experiential. It's not surprising, then, that its ["politics of
possibility" fails to mention the terms "race," "equality," or
"justice,"]{.underline} which would help connect to the actual
antagonisms of current social experience, while the lofty and
generalizing language of "human," "technology," and "growth" abound. 12
By [evading such key facets of justice-based
environmentalism]{.underline} -- which they do their best to consign to
the grave -- [**[Ecomodernism's]{.mark}** color-blind formulations
reflect]{.underline} yet another version of what Van Jones has called
["the unbearable **whiteness** of green,"]{.underline} here doubly
unbearable because the Manifesto's [[utopianism]{.mark} utterly
[fails]{.mark} to reflect on the intolerable social
conditions]{.underline} that it disappears and [implicitly seeks to
protect]{.underline}. 13 Alternately, if we can describe Jafa's video as
expressing an environmentalism of sorts -- which I argue we can, even
though the video's reception to date has largely evaded such an analysis
-- then it's one attuned to what Christina Sharpe terms "antiblackness
as total climate." 14 And compared to the Ecomodernist Manifesto's many
conceptual loopholes, Love is the Message is laser-focused on
figurations distorted within the everyday environments of
[[racial-cap]{.mark}italism['s **necropolitics**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Indeed, Jafa's stream of rhythmic edits cycles relentlessly through
shots of police hitting, pummeling, punching, shooting, and [brutalizing
Black bodies]{.underline} (recalling and updating approaches of Third
Cinema and specifically Cuban filmmaker Santiago Álvarez's thenshocking
portrayal of US racist policing set to Lena Horne's rousing civil-rights
number in his short 1965 film Now!). Visualizing the policing of
distinct climates of life and death, Jafa includes the 2015 murder of
Walter Scott in South Carolina, the abusive 2014 arrest of Kametra
Barbour in her car with her four children in Dallas, and the cruel
ground-tackling of fifteenyear-old, bikini-clad Dajerria Becton, who a
white police officer violently forced to the ground at a pool party in
McKinney, Texas in 2015. [Where long-term [environmental
management]{.mark} is [integrally related to social control]{.mark} with
racial, gendered, and classed differentials, we can term these practices
"climate control."]{.underline} Elsewhere, Jafa contextualizes this
historic anti-blackness with additional footage drawn from the
historical archive, showing midcentury scenes of police fire-hosing
Black protestors, striking civil rights activists with nightsticks, as
well as whites brutalizing lunch counter protestors in North Carolina,
and footage from D. W. Griffith's notorious 1915 film The Birth of a
Nation, with its scandalously positive portrayal of Klu Klux Klan
members and white actors in blackface. In returning to
**[Ecomodernism]{.underline}**, The Breakthrough Institute [willfully
contributes to the widespread invisibility of these scenes,
**divorcing** what may be termed the Black Anthropocene -- wherein
ecology is inseparable from the social terms of racial capitalism --
from its **geoengineered** future]{.underline}. 15 While these models
are capable of climate control at the regional level, as in its solar
radiation management proposals, Jafa's video, which exhibits affinities
with the fields of political ecology and climate justice 16 grounds the
environment as the realm of socio-political and techno-economic
inequality. This equation is most explicit where his video includes
passages of African-Americans wading through the flood waters of
Hurricane Katrina. For many New Orleanians, years of structural
negligence, municipal and infrastructure defunding, systematic racial
inequality, and impoverishment were only compounded by the "unnatural"
disaster. In fact, taking that context writ large,
[**[geoengineering]{.mark}** appears to be a technological construct
[mobilized]{.mark} in part precisely so as not to address social
injustice and [to **restrict**]{.mark} our [understanding]{.mark} of
environment [to]{.mark} the [biogeophysical]{.mark} realm.]{.underline}
Showing how [**police brutality** enacts the every day]{.underline} (and
sometimes spectacular) [meanings of US environmental
management]{.underline}, Love is the Message brings environmental
control down to the racialized and classed figural scale. We witness how
[[**white supremacy**, **disaster capitalism**]{.mark}, and
**[authoritarian neoliberalism]{.mark}** operate at such a granular
level, models that today have come to represent Trumpism, itself a
signature instance of the pathologies of Anthropocene
rationality]{.underline}. 17 "Climate change is global-scale violence
against places and species, as well as against human beings," contends
Rebecca Solnit. 18 Naomi Klein extends that insight where she writes how
["the reality of an economic order built on **white supremacy** is the
[whispered subtext of]{.mark} our entire [response to]{.mark} the
[climate crisis]{.mark},"]{.underline} which is far from accidental, but
rather "the result of a series of policy decisions the governments of
wealthy countries have made -- and continue to make -- with full
knowledge of the facts and in the face of strenuous objections." 19
Attacking such decisions at UN climate summits, the Sudanese diplomat
and climate negotiator Lumumba di Aping has [predicted the results to be
**["climate genocide,"]{.mark}** where [limiting warming to two
degrees]{.mark} Celsius [means accepting]{.mark} a global average that
will translate into 4-5 degrees in some places, meaning **"[Africa will
burn]{.mark}."**]{.underline} 20 Owing to the massive scales, delayed
impacts, and tremendous complexity of climate science, as well as its
networked agencies built of cybernetic systems, the challenge is urgent
to render these insights into visual evidence capable of forming
collective political subjects who act, so that we can shape the future
we want to live in -- at least while there's yet time left to do so. 21
Even while Love is the Message doesn't specifically reference
[geoengineering]{.underline}, it onetheless offers a discernable cry of
protest against the latter's [[ambition to **sustain**]{.mark} our
present culture [with no alteration to]{.mark} its governing
[sociopolitical and economic]{.mark} arrangements]{.underline}, with
[[**mitigation** technology only intervening at the level of]{.mark}
regional **[weather control]{.mark}** and atmospheric waste
management]{.underline}. By virtue of its montage, Jafa's video joins
passages of black death and police violence to close-up shots of angry
sun flares, as seen from NASA's International Space Station's near-live
feed, offering an insight common in environmental justice circles that
views global warming as a threat multiplier that exacerbates social
conflict and inequality. According to well-documented research,
[disenfranchised and impoverished [communities of color]{.mark}
experience higher levels of exposure to climate-related disasters and
their aftermath, food and water shortages, major health risks, and other
forms of **[environmental vulnerability]{.mark}**.]{.underline} 22 In
this vein, it's feasible to understand the video's footage of the
alien's dripping secondary jaws from Ridley Scott's 1979 classic, and
those of the city-destroying monster from Cloverfield, Matt Reeve's 2008
faux-found footage horror film, as further allegories, serving to
elevate the tragic-but-quotidian documents of police violence and social
oppression to the realm of cosmopolitical significance, the arena where
worlds are annihilated and remade. In other words, any given police
attack cannot be seen as a stand-alone local event, but rather, by
virtue of Jafa's stream of collected footage, part of systematic and
widespread violence, and more, as a matter of civilizational threat akin
to the horror of an alien assault on planet earth. As such, the
monstrous here is a story of racial injustice, which Jafa sets in a
post-natural dystopia resulting from runaway climate change. The many
film fables that the monstrous proposes might also be read variously as
representing the greedy and senseless destruction of the world conducted
by the [rapacious power of **carceral capital**]{.underline}, bolstered
by [police climate control, the colonization of debt, and the chains of
spectacle]{.underline}; the radical and [threatening otherness of racial
difference become a predatory behemoth]{.underline}; alternately, a
justice-seeking revenge fantasy upon white supremacist culture by what
lies beyond recognition; or the materialization of contemporary fears of
a genetically and geoengineered Frankensteinian science in creating
post-natural dystopias and runaway climate change -- or indeed some
element of each all mixed together without articulate or stable meaning.
The Breakthrough Institute also references our "contemporary
Frankenstein" -- enlisting no less than Bruno Latour in its theoretical
armory, who argues that we must not disown the planetary monster we have
created -- the earth of the Anthropocene -- but rather learn to love and
care for it through further technological acts of "modernizing
modernization." 23 While Naomi Klein overlooks Latour's subtler call for
a "compositionist" modernity as "a process of becoming ever-more
attached to, and intimate with, a panoply of nonhuman natures," she
criticizes the presumptuousness of his proposal especially where it aids
in the Institute's proengineering agenda: "The earth is not our
prisoner, our patient, our machine, or, indeed, our monster. It is our
entire world. And [the solution to global warming is not to fix the
world, it is to fix ourselves]{.underline}." 24 Adding to mounting
opposition to [[geoengineering]{.underline}]{.mark}, she highlights the
[[unintended side-effects]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g. [interfering in
Monsoons in South Asia, exacerbating drought in North Africa, widening
the ozone hole]{.underline}); the [lack of any regulatory protocol for
climate interventions with trans-national implications]{.underline}; its
[[lock-in effect]{.underline}]{.mark} making it next to [impossible to
abandon the technology]{.underline} once it's been implemented; its
[[anti-democratic basis]{.underline}]{.mark} in an era of globalism led
by a handful of powerful developed nations; and, crucially, its
[[directing]{.mark} of precious [resources **away** from]{.mark} the
[causes]{.mark} of climate disruption, [in favor]{.mark} of [addressing
**symptoms**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 25 Indeed, in recent years popular
resistance movements have formed around climate justice, asserting the
fundamental principle of ["system change, not climate
change,"]{.underline} where justice means dedication to equality,
fairness, and the inclusion of the most vulnerable and members of
frontline communities in the deliberation of climate solutions. Think of
the ongoing battle in central France to stop the new airport and
[[invent a non-capitalist commons]{.underline}]{.mark} at the Zad;
Standing Rock's ongoing opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline and
expression of multi-national resurgence in the name of Indigenous and
environmental rights; the many examples of Blockadia pitted against
fossil-fuel infrastructure and extraction projects across the Americas,
including protests in Louisiana against the Bayou Bridge Pipeline, in
British Columbia against the Trans Mountain Pipeline, and those in
Ecuador against oil drilling in Yasuní National Park; and the European
climate camps and the Ende Gelände \[Here and No Further!\] movement in
Germany, where the state is currently threatening to tear down the
ancient Hambach forest to dig for coal, evicting activists along the
way. 26 These are all pledged variously to the goal of reinventing forms
of life by [**[refusing]{.mark}** the imperatives of **capitalist
[growth]{.mark}** [and **market-based mechanisms** for addressing
climate]{.mark} breakdown]{.underline}, even while they also seek to
expand the social technologies of equality and justice. 27 But despite
such momentum and creative transitions, what's becoming clear with the
[ongoing development of [geoengineering]{.mark} is that massive
resources and funding bodies are [mobilizing]{.mark} the
[tech]{.mark}nology [under]{.mark} the star of the [neoliberal
Anthropocene]{.mark}]{.underline}. 28 If anything, that formation
parallels and joins the same forces that support the militarization and
technologization of police functions, growing economic inequality and
generalized indebtedness, the privatization of and creation of
for-profit prisons, and the criminalization of protest, to the point
where the criminal justice complex increasingly treats both
environmental and antiracist activism as terrorism. 29 Consider
Breakthrough Initiatives -- no relation to the Institute other than
sharing a trending term within the field of competitive tech development
-- which is one among many [trying to ["save]{.mark} the
[planet"]{.mark} and [motivated]{.mark} in doing so
[by]{.mark}]{.underline} what some see as a [[\$12 trillion
opportunity]{.underline}]{.mark}. 30 Funded in part by Facebook's Mark
Zuckerberg and Israeli-Russian venture capitalist Yuri Milner of Digital
Sky Technologies, and counting the late Stephen Hawking among its
collaborators, the project recently put \$100 million into a radio wave
project to search for alien life. 31 Led by a libertarian
entrepreneurialism that derides the outmoded and bureaucratic state
agencies of the Cold War, Breakthrough Initiatives is part of a growing
**["colonial futurism"]{.underline}** premised upon the
neoliberalization of outer space. It connects to the projects of Silicon
Valley's modeling of "NewSpace," as in the rhetoric of Elon Musk, set on
off-planet resource mining, terraforming other planets, and extending
property claims far into the galaxy. 32 With the neoliberal
corporate-military-state complex determined to occupy and settle the
very place that certain Afrofuturists have long sought as a destination
to escape colonized Earth, such starry-eyed fantasies are quickly
becoming grim futures. Other initiatives focus their attention on Earth,
representing how the [[**neocolonialist** spirit **haunts**]{.mark} new
wave [environmentalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. There's ScoPex, Harvard
University's current \$20 million Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation
Experiment, notable for its first-ever plans to test solar radiation
management technologies outside the lab in the earth's atmosphere above
Arizona. Led by David Keith, Harvard professor of applied physics,
founder and board member of the private corporation Carbon Engineering,
and signatory of "An Ecomodernist Manifesto," the project is supported
by Microsoft's Bill Gates and his Fund for Innovative Climate and Energy
Research, as well as by the Hewlett Foundation and the Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation (an appropriate beneficiary, considering it is named for the
longtime CEO of General Motors). 33 Notable for its funding model
joining university engineering and climate-science research to Big Tech
and fossil capital, ScoPex parallels a **[[marine
cloud-brightening]{.underline}]{.mark}** field experiment in Moss
Landing, California, led by the Joint Institute for the Study of the
Atmosphere and Ocean (JISAO) at the University of Washington, directed
by Thomas Peter Ackerman, Professor of Atmospheric Sciences, with Paul
Crutzen as a senior advisor. 34 With \$16 million in funding from Gates
and others, the project plans to shoot seawater droplets into the
atmosphere from a ship with high-pressure nozzles, creating a solar
shield to deflect sunlight. 35 In light of Cameroonian theorist Achille
Mbembe's diagnoses of creeping precaratization as "the becoming-black of
the world" -- meaning the [post-racial generalization of
dispossession]{.underline}, indebtedness, and loss of powers of
self-determination -- [**[geoengineering]{.mark}'s** desire to save the
world by whitening the sky reveals how completely **[detached]{.mark}**
the field is [from]{.mark} the **[catastrophes]{.mark}** currently
occurring on the ground in the here and now]{.underline}. 36 [While
geoengineering may profess to stem from love of earth, **[its message is
death]{.mark}**: the death [of social justice, equality, and democratic
inclusion]{.mark}.]{.underline} The go-to guide for Zuckerberg and Gates
is Yuval Noah Harari's recent book Homo Deus: A Brief History of
Tomorrow, which, tellingly, includes a chapter titled "The
Anthropocene." 37 Driven by an endless quest for "bliss, immortality,
and divinity," anthropos, in this narrative, figures as ultimate
self-creator, for whom no challenge -- climate change, agricultural
failure, artificial intelligence, planetary hunger, even death and
extinction -- will be beyond technological overcoming, especially when
matched to Silicon Valley capital. At the same time, [the cost will be
greater inequality and technocracy]{.underline}, an expanding useless
class, a new religion of algorithmic "dataism," and the reduction of
humanity to "biochemical subsystems" monitored by global networks. More
prosaically, the Good -- read: [[Neoliberal]{.mark} --
Anthropocene]{.underline} emerges in this and the Breakthrough
Institute's narrations [as [the ideological mechanism]{.mark} of choice
[for suspending contradictions between]{.mark} economic [growth and
climate solutions]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact, [even climate-change
denying Texas Republicans can get on board with geoengineering as a
not-to-be-missed pro-tech **economic opportunity**]{.underline},
requiring [[no need to]{.underline}]{.mark} debate sources of
environmental transformation or [[hold **petrocap**]{.mark}**italism**
[responsible]{.mark}]{.underline}, as [**[causality]{.mark}** is
**[sacrificed]{.mark}** [on the alter of
**techno-solutionism**]{.mark}]{.underline}. While the Trump
administration has defied the scientific consensus on climate change and
supported fossil-fuel deregulations, its February 2018 budget, supported
by many in congress, included the first-ever tax breaks for new
technologies of atmospheric carbon capture. Meanwhile, the Hoover
Institution, The Heartland Institute, and the American Enterprise
Institute -- all [key [conservative think-tanks]{.mark}]{.underline} --
support this move, the latter [[hailing
geoengineering]{.underline}]{.mark} as nothing less than "[a
[revolutionary]{.mark} approach to climate change."]{.underline} 38 Even
more alarming is the current conceptualization by Keith and others of
"counter-geoengineering," the counteracting of the militarization and
weaponization of climate manipulation technologies as deployed by
imagined rogue states or non-state actors. 39 This additional danger
dramatizes engineering's ungovernable status and potential for
destructive instrumentalization in the era of Homo Deus. Even more than
biologically regressive, neo-humanist and universalist, depoliticizing
and neocolonialist, [Anthropocene **geoengineering** is proving most
threatening where **techno-utopianism** merges with **military
unilateralism** in proposing near-future global weather
wars]{.underline}, going far beyond anything imagined in the Cold War.
While the horror of those systems are devastatingly presented in Jafa's
video, Love is the Message also powerfully intercuts passages portraying
the remarkable resilience, accomplishment, and beauty of African
American culture -- despite all -- in activism, politics, speculative
imagination, rhetoric, music, dance, literature, athletics, and,
profoundly, everyday forms of creativity. The negative and the positive,
love and death, repeatedly and relentlessly oscillate and converge in
explosive combination in his piece, proposing something like a singular
Vine compilation of cutting philosophical import, or an Instagram feed
of alternating soul-destroying and restorative affects. Jafa terms it
the "the abject sublime," an extraordinary mix of beauty and horror,
issuing from an archive of black visual culture that seems infinite in
its range of experiences. For Jafa, this ultimately beyond quantifiable
record of being stems from an ontological construction inseparable from
the wake of transatlantic slavery. 40 Indeed, the video's
description-defying vastness, its overwhelming multivalence, is signaled
in Greg Tate's necessarily transgressive grammar used in describing the
piece: "The viral outgrowth of an aborted found-footage exercise, the
7-minute video is an alternately
mirthful-cum-melancholic-cum-cardiac-arresting meditation on race-agency
wrapped in a visually sermonic recitation of race tragedy wrapped in a
nuanced and feverish exultation of diverse Black American lives at
various states of collapse and regeneration." 41 Yet even though the
video offers an amazing account of generative ambivalence and creative
survival, even while it also gives rise to encompassing hopefulness in
collective moments of love, solidarity, ethical conviction, and
collective justice-seeking, it simultaneously obliterates any
consideration of extending or sustaining its world of horror, one of
beyond grotesque inequality, impoverishment, and violence that renders
Black life and lives matterless by the state and its techno-human
apparatuses. Unlike The Breakthrough Institute, which proffers art and
leisure as rewards, Jafa's sci-fi reaches the realm of cosmopolitical
magnitude without losing sight of vernacular instances of in/justice, of
situated expressions that are future-oriented but historically informed,
and which are dedicated to the reinvention of everyday life, art,
culture, politics, mourning. It follows, then, that Jafa would extend
solidarity to a younger generation by including artist Martine Syms.
During her cameo, she reads from her 2015 "Mundane Afrofuturist
Manifesto," which reprises the longstanding black cultural aesthetic
that draws on visions of a utopian time to come, one reached only by
passing through the traumatic alienations of racial capitalism. No
simple time travel or shapeshifting is possible, however. 42 "Mundane
Afrofuturists recognize that we are not aliens," Syms explains, while
facing the camera seated behind a desk. Jafa borrows the clip from
Syms's eponymous documentary, which, over the course of its hour-long
duration, eschews what its author sees as the depoliticized fantasies of
past Afrofuturisms. According to Syms, they have sunk into hackneyed
fashions, commodifiable styles and stale pop-cultural spectacles severed
from any radical imagination inspiring collective liberation. More, she
warns against acritical escapism, as when "magic interstellar travel
and/or the wondrous communication grid" lead to "an illusion of outer
space and cyberspace as egalitarian." For her, "jive-talking aliens,"
"reference to Sun Ra," and "Egyptian mythology and iconography" are all
out, calling instead for "a new focus on black humanity: our science,
technology, culture, politics, religions, individuality, needs, dreams,
hopes, and failings ... Mundane [**Afrofuturism** is the ultimate
laboratory for world-building outside of imperialist, **capitalist**,
**white patriarchy**]{.underline}." 43 While Love is the Message
expresses potential solidarity with the oppressed and excluded, both
human and non, Syms's sentiment rejects equivalence between racial
difference and the monstrous. It is expressive of what Aria Dean
diagnoses as the conjunction of black accelerationism and Afrofuturism
that entails both a catalytic movement toward "the end of the world" and
a revolution beyond the in/humanisms of racial capitalism. 44 In other
words, a younger generation has elected to update Afrofuturism, asking
us to witness a double move that rhymes negative critique with positive
transformation. The challenge here is [bringing this vision of social
critique and social liberation into]{.underline} explicit connection --
and more importantly, [direct conflict -- with the neoliberal
Anthropocene, and to **oppose** the threat of white supremacist
tendencies and **[colonial, extractive futurism]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
These Ecomodernist agendas are intent on shaping the world to come; with
resources and the political will to do so, it will not only [set us on a
track of [**unstoppable** climate transformation]{.mark} but also
interminably extend [**racial injustice** and **white
supremacy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 45 Against that scenario, we urgently
need to invent and work toward cultivating futures beyond the world's
end, where that end is no longer unthinkable beyond current
socio-political and economic arrangements, or where that end has already
in fact occurred. 46 It is urgent that we ask ourselves, why should
cultures outside Afrofuturism -- which remain comfortably shielded by
whiteness and the current narratives that uphold its position -- care?
One answer is to reiterate the [desirable terms of a shared world where
"injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.]{.underline}"
Expressing [a future-oriented imperative with new politico-ecological
purpose]{.underline}, Fred Moten, in a recent public conversation with
Robin D. G. Kelley, has updated that famous ethico-political formulation
of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (who, it should be noted, makes a notable
appearance in Jafa's video). He posits the mission of contemporary Black
studies as "on the most fundamental level to try to save the earth, and
on a secondary level to save the possibility of human existence." Kelley
adds that this is a ["project for liberation," a "transformative
project,"]{.underline} and [if it doesn't exist as a response to "the
neoliberal, neo-fascist turn, then it's worthless.]{.underline}" 47 Why
should this project for liberation not also be the overarching
imperative of artistic practice today? If so, then art will name the
practice of creative aesthetics that merges ecological insight with
political engagement in the hopes of not only saving what good we have
but securing a flourishing and emancipated future for all.

The [[plutocratic]{.mark} carbon [ruling classes]{.mark}]{.underline}
have the means to [[buy themselves out of]{.mark} the short-term
disruptions]{.underline} and stresses of a heating world: from insurance
to bunkers, Mars exploration, creating exclusionary 'safe zones' and
buying property in 'safe' parts of the world. In the long run, however,
the [plutocrats will also face catastrophic [climate change]{.mark},
resulting in the need to [reach for **techno fixes**]{.mark} such as
**[geoengineering]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Simply, [geoengineering is
about using technology to manipulate Earth's climate system to reduce
global heating.]{.underline} Climate-altering technologies are used to
control Earth's thermometer. There are controversial aspects to the
definitional remit of geoengineering (Wetter et al. 2016): whether to
include weather-altering interventions, such as cloud seeding, or to
limit it to [[tech]{.mark}nologies that [deflect sunlight]{.mark} away
from Earth, [a]{.mark}lso [k]{.mark}nown [a]{.mark}s **[solar radiation
management]{.mark}**]{.underline} (such as continuously spraying sulphur
dioxide into the stratosphere to reflect more of the sun's rays
outward), and technologies that remove, capture and/or store carbon
dioxide, such as ocean fertilisation with iron, nitrogen or bio char.
Wetter and colleagues (2016) argue for definitional aspects which
include intentional or deliberate activity (despite unintended
consequences); global or large-scale effects, even if it has local
deployment; and a high-technology approach involving unknown risk to the
environment. Playing with Earth's thermometer is a harder task than we
think but also has grave consequences for human and non-human life. If
these technologies are in private hands, we are all at the mercy of
these profiteers. Moreover, [[if wealthy countries control]{.mark} these
[tech]{.mark}nologies, the [implications for]{.mark} North--South
[geopolitics are]{.mark} nothing short of
**[colonial]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But there are also [[democracy
deficits]{.mark} and the dangers of unintended consequences on a
planetary scale]{.underline}. Klein (2019: 107) argues that the truth is
that geoengineering is itself a rogue proposition. By definition,
technologies that tamper with ocean and atmospheric chemistry on a
planetary scale affect everyone. Yet it is [impossible to get anything
like unanimous consent for these interventions]{.underline}. Nor could
any such consent possibly be informed, given that we don't, and can't,
know the full risks involved until these planet-altering technologies
are actually deployed. Funding, research and modelling of geoengineering
has taken off. In 2010, the US House Committee on Science, Space and
Technology recommended more research on geoengineering, giving momentum
to a British government research agenda and to millions spent by the
Gates Foundation to experiment and develop geoengineering solutions
(Klein 2019: 106--107). Scientists such as Paul Crutzen, Nobel Prize
winner for his work on the ozone layer, supports it, as does the widely
read magazine Science. By 2008 Republican politicians like Newt Gingrich
were calling on the American public to reject legislation that led to
fossil fuel reductions and instead called on them to support
geoengineering of the atmosphere through sulphates as a better solution.
Since then numerous [neoconservative think tanks have openly come out in
support of geoengineering]{.underline}: the American Enterprise
Institute, Cato, Hoover, the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the
International Conference on Climate Change, the mainstay of climate
denialists and sceptics (Wetter et al. 2016). In 2013, the UN IPCC
included geoengineering as a solution in its report Climate Change: The
Physical Science Basis. 6 While the UN has not given full endorsement
for such technologies, it has not consistently rejected geoengineering
as part of the scientific research agenda. As it stands, [powerful
carbon states, philanthropic capital, carbon capital, some scientists
and academics, and the UN IPCC are churning the tide of geoengineering,
rather than phasing out fossil fuels and advancing resourcing for deep
just transitions and for capacity building to deal with climate
shocks]{.underline}. [The techno fixes of **[eco-fascism]{.mark}** are
irrational and undemocratic]{.underline}. They express [elite panic and
reflect a **[capitalist technotopia]{.mark}**, a worldview that has
failed to emancipate humanity]{.underline}. LIMITS OF ECO-FASCISM
Increasing planetary heating due to carbon extraction and use takes the
world into an unprecedented place in human history. In 2019 alone the
costs of hurricanes, floods and wildfires cost the world US\$150 billion
(Ziady 2020). Climate shocks are already costing the US billions of
dollars annually, including over the past decade with droughts,
hurricanes, floods, wild fires, freezes and severe storms. According to
McKibben (2019: 28), climate costs in the US are at \$240 billion per
year and the world at \$1.2 trillion annually, wiping out 1.6 per cent
of the global GDP. No country is going to be immune from its impacts and
consequences. [Eco-fascists cannot use incarceration, walls and powerful
militaries to manage this planetary crisis]{.underline}. The [[US
military]{.mark} itself is [concerned about overstretch]{.mark} in a
**[permanent crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline} in which its own operations
will be seriously constrained. All of humanity will be tested and the
divisions and rivalries of a new eco-fascism will be difficult to
sustain. Planetary awareness of the [climate emergency]{.underline} and
the need for decisive action is growing. In 2019, several important
scientific studies issued by UN agencies dealing with land use, climate
hot spots, planetary heating and its implications for agriculture, and
climate-change impacts on our oceans, as well as an emission gaps
report, were made available to policy makers and publics. At the same
time, many media outlets have started mainstreaming climate news. The
informed global public is growing, including inside the US, where 72 per
cent of Americans affirm it is important (Revkin 2019), and the list of
countries committing to transitions to net zero carbon targets is
increasing.7 Climate justice politics has also gone through two cycles
of resistance. Between 2007 and 2015 climate justice forces successfully
developed a critique and ideological discourse around climate justice
alternatives, as the basis of systemic change. The high point of this
cycle of resistance was the Cochabamba People's Summit in 2010, hosted
by the only climate justice state in the interstate system, Bolivia.
From 2016 onwards a new cycle of resistance began with the Standing Rock
struggle against the Dakota Access Pipeline. In the wake of this iconic
struggle, Extinction Rebellion, Greta Thunberg's #FridaysForFuture, the
US-based Sunrise Movement and the Climate Justice Charter process in
South Africa have all emerged as '1°C movements'. These initiatives have
played a crucial role in shifting public discourse and register in
policy debates from below. These forces will grow on a planetary scale
as the climate crisis worsens and the [eco-fascist [class project stands
in the way of]{.mark} fundamental [transformation]{.mark} to prevent a
1.5°C overshoot.]{.underline}

Another certainty: there is little doubt that global warming is the
underlying cause of the splitting of the jet stream. Indeed, its
stability is conditioned by the temperature differential between the
pole and the equator. As the [warming in the Arctic is greater than the
global average]{.underline}, the differential weakens and the [jet
stream becomes more irregular]{.underline}, slower, more capricious,
which can lead to its splitting. Heatwaves and drought are therefore
very clearly attributable to climate change, against which the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been warning for
thirty years. According to the latest IPCC report (WG1) "it is virtually
certain that the frequency and intensity of hot extremes and the
intensity and duration of heatwaves have increased since 1950
\[globally\] and will further increase in the future even if global
warming is stabilized at 1.5°C." The report states that "the combination
of heatwave and drought has probably increased" and that "this trend
will continue." For Europe, the report projects (with a high level of
confidence) an increase in pluvial flooding in the north-east of the
continent and an increase in droughts in the Mediterranean region, with
reduced summer rainfall in the south-east. No surprises, therefore: the
observed reality is consistent with scientific projections. Except for
the fact, and this is not a detail, that it far exceeds them. By a long
chalk. In reality, [everything is [going much faste]{.mark}r than the
mathematical models indicated]{.underline}. The climatologists
interviewed by the press do not hide their surprise at
[[temperatures]{.mark} which [suddenly jump]{.mark} 4° or 5°C above the
seasonal averages]{.underline}. Rather, such extremes were expected
around 2030, or beyond -- if governments continued to do (almost)
nothing. We must bear this observation in mind to address the second
point: possible evolution. What the Future Holds for Us, and What it is
Likely to Hold Like others, I have often drawn attention to a fairly
recent scientific publication1 which has caused quite a stir. Authored
by luminaries in the field, it discusses the positive retroactions of
warming (in other words. the effects of [warming promoting
warming]{.underline}). Its originality is to examine the way in which
[[positive feedbacks]{.mark} could feed each other in a sort of
[snowball effect]{.mark}, or cascading reaction.]{.underline} The
following quote2 is crystal clear: ["\[S\]elf-reinforcing feedbacks
could push the Earth System toward a planetary threshold that, if
crossed, could prevent stabilization of the climate at intermediate
temperature rises and [cause]{.mark} continued warming on a ['Hothouse
Earth']{.mark} pathway even as human emissions are
reduced]{.underline}." According to the authors of the article, the
[process could begin at a relatively low level of warming]{.underline},
between +1°C and +3°C. One of the feedbacks [[most likely to
trigger]{.mark} the process is the [destabilization of]{.mark} the
Greenland [ice cap]{.mark}]{.underline}. This cap constitutes a
particularly fragile point. Specialists estimate that the tipping point
for its disintegration is somewhere between +1° (+1.5°C according to the
IPCC) and +3°C of average warming. We are therefore probably already in
the danger zone, or in the process of approaching it at high speed (with
unchanged policy, +1.5°C will be crossed before 2040, according to the
IPCC). [If this tipping point were crossed]{.underline}, what would be
the consequences? On the one hand, the influx of water into the ocean
would [[accelerate]{.mark} the rise in [sea level]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The process would take a long time to come to an end -- a new
equilibrium point -- but [would be [irreversible]{.mark}]{.underline}.
On the other hand, this influx could [lead to an abrupt, [sudden
collapse of]{.mark} the ocean circulation called Atlantic Middle Ocean
Circulation (**[AMOC]{.mark}**)]{.underline}, which conditions the
climate of the regions bordering the Atlantic. And there, [the impacts
would be immediate.]{.underline} Here is what the recent IPCC Working
Group 1 report says about the risk of AMOC collapse (IPCC AR6, WG1, TS
p. 73): "While there is medium confidence that the projected decline in
the AMOC will not involve an abrupt collapse before 2100, such a
collapse might be triggered by an unexpected meltwater influx from the
Greenland Ice Sheet. If an AMOC collapse were to occur, it would very
likely cause abrupt shifts in the regional weather patterns and water
cycle, such as a southward shift in the tropical rain belt, and could
result in weakening of the African and Asian monsoons, strengthening of
Southern Hemisphere monsoons, and drying in Europe." Everything is
obviously in this "if" which opens the possibility of "abrupt shifts."
One thing is certain: [the consequences of these shifts would be
extremely severe for ecosystems and populations]{.underline}. Especially
obviously for the poor masses of Asia and Africa. [Hundreds of millions
of humans would be faced with dramatic situations.]{.underline} As we
have read, [Europe would not be spared]{.underline}. The Iberian
Peninsula is particularly threatened. Desertification has been
progressing there for years. It would cross a qualitative threshold,
[irreversible on a human scale.]{.underline} What is the possible link
with the current drought and heatwave, knowing that Greenland is not
surrounded by the splitting of the jet stream which explains these
phenomena. The link is that, for a variety of reasons, [warming over the
Arctic is twice the global average]{.underline}. According to the IPCC,
it is "virtually certain" that the Greenland ice cap has been losing
mass since 1990": specialists estimate that 4890 gigatons (billion tons)
of ice (+- 460) melted between 1992 and 2020, leading to an increase in
the sea level by 13.5 mm. The IPCC emphasizes (once again!) a very
important point: these projections are based solely on estimates of ice
melt: they do not include the dynamic processes that would accelerate
the loss of mass (the detachment of huge fractions of the cap sliding
into the ocean), because "Importantly, likely range projections do not
include those ice-sheet-related processes whose quantification is highly
uncertain or that are characterized by deep uncertainty" (IPCC AR6, WG1,
TS, p. 79). In view of what is happening elsewhere on the planet, it is
not unreasonable to fear that evolution, in Greenland too, will be
faster than the models project. That's an understatement. In fact, a
number of clues clearly point in this direction. Thus, at the end of
July 2022, the temperature in Greenland far exceeded seasonal norms. The
melting of the ice was twice as important as the other years at the same
period. In three days, an estimated 18 billion tons of ice were
transformed into water. Scientists have calculated that the amount of
water thus released would cover the territory of West Virginia (62,259
km2) with a layer of water of about thirty centimeters[. This
acceleration of melting processes is
[unprecedented]{.mark}]{.underline}.3 No need to expand further: the
climate future is more threatening than ever. The lights are red,
flashing insistently, and the poorest, the most fragile risk taking the
brunt of it. What To Do? (a well-known tune) Let's move on to the
policies to be implemented. The catastrophe is underway and the IPCC
tells us that it will continue to progress "even if the warming is
limited to 1.5°C." Note in passing that the current disaster is the
product of a warming of "only" 1.2°C compared to the pre-industrial era.
It is not very difficult to imagine what will come after... Given the
situation, it goes without saying that we cannot content ourselves with
demanding radical measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions: these
measures are obviously essential -- more than ever! -- but they must be
combined with an immediate and very concrete policy of adaptation to the
observed and foreseeable warming. Faced with the increasingly frequent
and intense combination of drought and heatwave, what can be done to
protect people, plants and animals? [A [short, medium and long term
vision]{.mark} is necessary]{.underline}. It must aim to articulate a
public adaptation plan that is both binding (to be effective) and
flexible (to be adaptable to the unexpected). This plan must include
priority components in terms of water management, prevention of the
health effects of extreme heat (for vulnerable people and at city level,
confronted with the phenomenon of "heat islands"), agriculture --
forestry, land use planning, infrastructure and energy. The latest
report of the second IPCC Working Group can give ideas on how to design
the plan and fight for the plan from social movements. This report is
obviously not anti-capitalist, but it reads that "Prevailing development
pathways do not advance climate resilient development" (very high
confidence) (IPCC AR6, TS.E.1.1, p. 100). The reasons cited are: the
widening of income inequalities, unplanned urbanization, forced
migration and displacement, the continuous increase in greenhouse gas
emissions, the continuation of changes in land use, the reversal of the
long-term trend toward longer life expectancy...4 [The [denunciation of
neoliberal policies]{.mark}]{.underline} is implicit, but quite clear.
On the positive side, the IPCC report rightly insists on the fact that
[adaptation to climate change must be holistic, social, democratic,
participatory, reduce inequalities, rely on the weakest social groups,
strengthen the social positions of women, young people and
minorities]{.underline}, etc. But its approach is focused on the
decision-makers it seeks to convince, not on social movements and their
struggles. However, [it is on these [**social** movements]{.mark} that
everything depends, [not]{.mark} on
**[governments]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is not the place to
elaborate a catalogue of demands, we will content ourselves with a few
indications and reflections. [Water management is a key
point]{.underline}. As the IPCC (WG2) writes, "Central to equity issues
about water is that it remains a public good (high confidence)" (IPCC
AR6, WG2, TS.E.2.5). It's the guiding line. In particular, it involves
[[questioning]{.mark} the [monopolization of water]{.mark} resources [by
capitalist]{.mark} groups producing bottled water and various
beverages]{.underline}, that of forests by producers of paper pulp,
pellets or other goods ( see the ecological and human damage caused by
eucalyptus plantations in Portugal!), [that of groundwater by
agribusiness]{.underline} (in Andalusia, for example). But the guiding
line of water as a public good also implies a host of more immediate
concrete demands: going back on the waterproofing of surfaces, on the
sewerage of rainwater, on the rectification of streams, on the
destruction of wetlands; promote agricultural and forestry techniques
that restore soils and their absorption capacity by limiting runoff;
reorient agriculture much more radically toward agroecology; without
forgetting the investment in the distribution network (in Wallonia,
Belgium, for example, 20 per cent of the water produced is not invoiced
-- network leaks are therefore very significant). A rational, social and
ecological management of water requires another pricing policy. [The
[liberal 'true-cost']{.mark} policy is [socially
unjust]{.mark}]{.underline}, since all consumers pay for industrial
wastewater treatment in large quantities. Moreover, the [[neoliberal
policy encourages]{.mark} the [waste]{.mark} of the
resource]{.underline}, since the financial income of the distributor
depends in part on the fact that the users also pay for the purification
-- useless! -- of the rainwater put into the sewer... [[Another system
must be implemented]{.underline}]{.mark}: for households, free
consumption corresponding to the reasonable satisfaction of real needs
(drinking, baths and showers, washing the house, doing the dishes and
laundry, etc.), then rapidly progressive pricing above beyond this
level. The protection of people should be another effective priority.
This is not the case. Led by climatologist JP van Ypersele, the Wallon
Platform for the IPCC notes that the 2003 heatwave killed more than
1,200 people while that of 2020 killed more than 1,400... Between the
two dates, nothing was therefore done... in spite of promises... A
public plan for adaptation to extreme heat should at least organize the
systematic greening of agglomerations (trees everywhere, to provide
shade) as well as the thermal insulation of all hospitals, schools,
homes for the elderly or disabled. More broadly, [we must reaffirm the
urgent need to insulate and renovate all housing]{.underline}. Not only
to radically reduce emissions from heating (and air conditioning!) but
also to protect health and well-being. In this matter as in others, the
observation is there: [the neoliberal policies of [incentive by
market]{.mark} mechanisms are both [ecologically inefficient]{.mark} and
socially unjust]{.underline}. This policy of half measures must give way
to a public initiative, [otherwise [individual
solutions]{.mark}]{.underline} such as the purchase of air conditioners
will prevail, [leading to an [increase in]{.mark} energy consumption and
CO2 [emissions]{.mark}.]{.underline} The IPCC insists on the importance
of a holistic policy, which considers both adaptation to global warming
and the reduction of emissions ("mitigation," in the jargon). Typically,
the energy sector straddles both areas. There is a lack of water to cool
the nuclear reactors. In view of the projections, this reality can only
worsen in the years to come, so that the adaptation policy will be faced
with infernal alternatives: should the water be used as a priority to
cool the power stations (by heating rivers!) to generate electricity? to
drink ? or to water the crops? (and which crops?) All the more reason
(there are many others!) not to count on nuclear power as a "mitigation"
solution... I will not go back here on the measures to be taken in terms
of structural reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, I have already
devoted many writings to them. In short: [[**energy and finance** must
be **socialized**]{.mark}, in the same way as water, we must get out of
agribusiness and organize the rapid end of mobility based on the
individual car]{.underline}. This bouquet of [deep [**structural**
transformations]{.mark}]{.underline} is the necessary -- but not
sufficient -- [condition [for]{.mark} a rapid and effective
[decarbonization]{.mark} of the global economy]{.underline}.
[[Without]{.mark} this [drastic **anti-cap**]{.mark}**italist** remedy,
it will prove to be strictly **impossible** to respect the climatic
constraints explained by the scientists. In this case, the **['Hothouse
Earth']{.mark}** evoked by Johann Rockström and the other authors
mentioned above will most certainly [become]{.mark} an
**[irreversible]{.mark}** reality]{.underline}. It would mean a [human
and ecological cataclysm of [**unimaginable** magnitude]{.mark}.
Inconceivable]{.underline}. "Notional" Climate Policy or Ecosocialism?
Every cloud has a silver lining: everyone can now become aware of the
[extreme gravity of the situation and the terrible danger we are
facing]{.underline}. I reproduce here an excerpt from a post published
on August 11 on social networks, concerning the drought in Europe: "With
the floods (of 2021 in Belgium and Germany), climate change has given
us, so to speak, a blow on the head. A blow from a club hurts, it can
kill those who are on the front line. With the drought, warming shows
that it can take us by the throat and squeeze slowly, each day a little
more, without rushing, so that we will have plenty of time to see death
progress -- the most lucid see it already: the death of plants, the
death of rivers, the death of animals, our own death. Because how could
we survive when everything disappears?" Faced with what is at stake,
everyone can also become aware of the fact that [[government
**policies** are totally **inadequate**]{.mark}, and to be honest,
criminal. These policies **[do not]{.mark}** make it possible to [reduce
emissions quickly]{.mark} (emissions continue to
**increase**!)]{.underline} to reach "zero carbon" in 2050. [It is [even
the **opposite**]{.mark}]{.underline} that is happening before our eyes:
the post-pandemic recovery and Putin's war against the Ukrainian people
have unleashed an all-out rush on fossil fuels (coal in China, Russia,
Turkey; lignite in Germany; shale gas in the United States; gas in the
European Union). With on top of that a frenzy of neocolonial grabbing,
rivalries between powers and barbaric management of migrations. [Not
only are government climate policies **ineffective**, not only do they
**[increase]{.mark}** social **[inequalities]{.mark}**, but
[they]{.mark} also [do not protect populations]{.mark} against
**disasters**]{.underline}. This protection of populations is however,
in theory, [the elementary constitutional task of any
government]{.underline}, of any state. This formidable mess is a
potential factor in the [spectacular deepening of the crisis of
legitimacy]{.underline} of the powerful of this world, regardless of the
"camp" to which they belong. The [instability thus created should not
fail to have repercussions on the ideological level]{.underline}. We had
an example of this recently, in Belgium, with the free forum in the form
of self-criticism that Mr. Bruno Colmant published in La Libre. In this
text, the ex-chief of staff of the very liberal Didier Reynders, the
economist who designed the "notional interest" scam, believes that
"[[**neoliberal capitalism** is **no longer compatible**]{.mark} with
the climate challenge.]{.underline}" Mr. Colmant is right: [the **"free
market"** will **not** get us out of the impasse]{.underline}. Meeting
the [[climate challenge]{.mark} imperatively [requires a **public**
plan]{.mark}]{.underline}, social and ecological [objectives other than
profit]{.underline}, public resources, and therefore a [[**radical
redistribution** of wealth, contrary to "]{.mark}neoliberal
**[reforms]{.mark}**."]{.underline} However, having criticized
"neoliberal capitalism," Mr. Colmant finds himself in the uncomfortable
position of someone who stops in the middle of the ford. Indeed, the
neoliberal dogma of the free market is not the only [obstacle on the way
to a rational management of the climatic catastrophe: the
[**capitalist**]{.mark} obligation of **[growth]{.mark}** is another,
even more **[fundamental obstacle]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and one that
Mr. Colmant is not ready to overcome. [A non-liberal, Keynesian or
[**neo-Keynesian capitalism** can exist]{.mark}]{.underline}. A
capitalism without growth is, as Schumpeter said, a contradiction in
terms. However, [[without]{.mark} a **[decrease]{.mark}** in final
energy consumption -- and therefore without a decrease in production and
transport -- it is [**impossible** to reach **"zero
emissions"**]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2050. [[Even]{.mark} by sweeping
the carbon under the carpet [with]{.mark} "offsets,"
"capture-sequestration," and other "[notional emission
reductions,]{.mark}" this is excluded. It is an **[objective
necessity]{.mark}**: we [must **produce less**]{.mark}, work less,
transport less, **[share wealth]{.mark}**]{.underline}, take care
prudently and democratically of beings and things. It is necessary, in
other words, to [[**break** the]{.mark} productivist **[capitalist
machine]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Productivist? we should say
"destructivist," so clear is that "Capital ruins the only two sources of
all wealth: the Earth and the worker" (as Marx said after his
anti-productivist turn).5 [**The [climate war]{.mark}** has begun and it
[is]{.mark} a **[class war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. By this I mean that

They argue that [**[solar geoengineering]{.mark}** will likely play a
**[fundamental]{.mark}** role in this formation of [planetary
management]{.mark}. While geoengineering would not in and of itself
constitute climate Leviathan, \"any attempt to modify the world\'s
albedo will require decisions over the fate of the Earth\'s climate and
energy, nothing less than life and death\"]{.underline} (Wainwright and
Mann 2018: 149), and here [they **[link]{.mark}** solar geoengineering
[to]{.mark} broader processes constructing planetary [**sovereignty**,
including]{.mark} space [**weaponry** and **capitalism**]{.mark}**\'s**
recurring global **economic crises**.]{.underline}

Planetary sovereignty is thus constituted in the \"necessities crisis
and catastrophe demand: [hegemonic military-political capacity at a
scale adequate to **\'save the planet,\'** the production and protection
of **geoengineering**]{.underline} ... and finally, [the sovereign power
to name emergency]{.underline}, initiate the institutional and technical
responses deemed appropriate, and ensure ... their legitimacy\"
(Wainwright and Mann 2018: 151). Such a configuration could emerge along
two geopolitical paths. The first is a U.S.-centric climate Leviathan
wherein the [United States maintains its current military dominance
\"and **exploits** the \'need to save life on Earth\' as the ideological
basis of a new imperial hegemony]{.underline}.\" The second scenario
sees U.S. hegemony continue to falter, with planetary governance
unfolding on \"conflictual geopolitical terrain upon which elites
continue to seek \'adaptations\' that meet their needs ... \[with\] the
United States and China (or some other small cohort of globally
influential powers) deciding to reorganize the world system in a sort of
grand compromise that includes shared planetary management\" (Wainwright
and Mann 2018: 152).

Wainwright and Mann deem the second scenario more likely. Yet, the
notion of a \"grand compromise\" in planetary management elides the fact
[that **[solar geoengineering]{.mark}** and other forms of planetary
governance are deeply [**interwoven** with questions of hegemonic
transition]{.mark}, **control** of energy, [imperialist **rivalry**,
and]{.mark} financial and [**military** power, rendering the U.S. and
China **more likely to compete** rather than cooperate in this
realm]{.mark}]{.underline}. Hence, I argue that the first scenarios
outlined by both Arrighi and Wainwright and Mann -- U.S. led efforts to
retain hegemony via military dominance -- cannot be seen as simply more
or less \"likely.\" Rather, this strategy [must be pursued by U.S.
power, [lest]{.mark} the [U.S. voluntary **surrender** its **hegemonic**
position within global capitalism (which is]{.mark} in turn
[**underpinned** by **U.S. hegemony**]{.mark}]{.underline}, Panitch and
Gindin 2012). The kind of planetary sovereignty envisioned by Wainwright
and Mann -- a [command and control system organized through
[multilateral world governance]{.mark} managing a transition to highly
diffuse forms of renewable energy]{.underline} -- [would not merely
[require a]{.mark} new form of sovereign power,]{.underline} but a
fundamentally different form of capitalism and [[wholesale hegemonic
transition]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is entirely conceivable that
capitalism can thrive within a renewable energy regime (McCarthy 2015),
but there is no guarantee that this would be capitalism under U.S.
hegemony, and would require capital to systematically abandon many
traditional -- and in some cases fundamental -- sources of power
(namely: cheap, highly concentrated energy subsidized by imperial
violence, see Malm 2016; Mitchell 2009; Moore 2015).

[[All solutions are viewed through the lens of]{.mark}, [and]{.mark}
ultimately **[nullified by]{.mark}**, the **demands of [commercial
viability]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Tanuro's book is an expert
deconstruction of the arguments for market-based solutions to climate
change. [Without a thorough understanding of **capitalism**, it's hard
to understand how things got so bad.]{.underline} [[We see the
**battle** between **cost efficiency** and **actual
efficiency** ]{.mark}being played everywhere.]{.underline} The result,
to quote Ban Ki-Moon, who seems to grasp the consequence if not the
cause, is that ['[we]{.mark} have our feet **glued to the accelerator**
and [are **hurtling towards the abyss**]{.mark}.']{.underline}

Carbon trading is a prime example. The distribution of carbon credits
(legal rights to CO^2^ emissions) has been shaped by the need to protect
profitable, competitive industries. While hospitals and universities are
given insufficient quotas and obliged to buy credit, in 2005 the
European steel industry made a tidy €480 million by outsourcing
production and selling their surplus CO^2^. UK energy companies have
made an extra £800 million and passed the costs onto individual
consumers(p.79). [[The system does more to **build the 'eco-industry
sector'** than to combat **climate change**]{.mark}, but it does make
money while giving governments a little eco-friendly
legitimacy]{.underline} (p.84).

Perhaps worst of all, the price on carbon emissions is 'too small to
discourage polluters ... but big enough to annoy those impoverished by
neoliberalism' (p.115). The IPCC estimates the cost of carbon emissions
would have to be five times higher to be an effective deterrent. In the
current system, this would only lead to corporations passing the cost
onto consumers, plunging millions more into fuel poverty, and costing
lives. '\[Such a policy\] by gambling on the price of fossil fuels
without previously creating the conditions for reducing their use, and
by increasing exemptions for business, shows its true nature -- it is
another transfer of wealth to large capitalist undertakings'(p.68).

[[The **profit motive** continues to]{.mark} favour fossil fuels and
when advocating alternatives, [select]{.mark}s **[the
worst]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The production of biofuels is deeply
inefficient and destructive.

*'*[[The logic of production for profit leads to the
production]{.underline}]{.mark} *of ethanol and biodiesel* [[for **those

the extensive use of pesticides)* [[and]{.mark} over [the]{.mark}
**protection of the [environment']{.mark}**\]{.underline}
*(p.102).*

Then we have [[nuclear power]{.underline}]{.mark}, an increasingly
divisive topic for the green movement. [Putting aside the [question of
public **safety**]{.mark}, powerfully highlighted by the **Fukushima
disaster** and [**unresolvable** in a **capitalist system** that will
cut corners]{.mark} wherever it can afford to, nuclear energy [is an
**inadequate solution**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Tanuro concludes:
'renewable energy sources and [nuclear power obey]{.underline} two
completely different and [opposing strategies for
implementation]{.underline} -- decentralisation and maximum efficiency
in the case of renewables, [[**ultra-centralisation** and waste]{.mark}
in the case of nuclear power']{.underline} (pp.106-7).

[Whether it is more pragmatic to tackle capitalism or to ignore it will
be determined by whether it is possible for climate constraints to be
respected following strategies determined by commercial potential. In a
word, the answer is no.]{.underline} A meaningful transition to
renewable energy will require not only massive public investment but an
entirely new energy system (p.83):

*'In a word, while the current system is governed by the partial logic
of cost effectiveness, calculated installation by installation in a
context of competition, its successor will have to favour global
thermodynamic efficiency, which will mean planning independently of
costs, in a context of cooperation' (p.70).*

As inconvenient a truth as it might be, [[solving the problem is **not
possible** in an economy dominated by corporations whose 'logic is to
**profit** from the **catastrophes in the South** to increase
their]{.mark}]{.underline} stranglehold [on the [resources]{.mark} of
the planet [and extend it to new domains']{.mark}]{.underline} (p.119).
[[We saw]{.underline}]{.mark} when the poor were left to fend for
themselves during Hurricane Katrina, [[how **ill-equipped** the market
system is to protect **even 'the Western poor'**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
In fact New Orleans' budget for sea wall maintenance was cut from 2003
to finance the War on Terror, during which they were receiving a sixth
of the funds they requested (p.99). Separating the hurricane from its
political context is impossible, and there is a lesson in that.

#### The development of nuclear power is [antithetical]{.underline} to socialist futures\-\--it's inherently connected to the [capitalist violence]{.underline} of the state.

In their Catalyst article, Huber and Staﬀord (2023, 75) write: "From a
social-ist perspective [aiming for]{.underline} reliable nonstop,
zero-carbon power, [[nuclear energy]{.underline}]{.mark} would be the
foundation of the grid." The risks associated with nuclear are
exaggerated in popular attitudes; problems with radioactive waste have
been "overstated." They [[**do not** engage with researchers]{.mark} of
nuclear who assert that [there is]{.mark}]{.underline}: (1) [[**no
long-term** solution to]{.mark} the **[waste]{.mark}
problem**]{.underline}; (2) that there is "[no working deep repository
for high level waste anywhere]{.underline}", despite limited progress in
Finland and Sweden (Cullen 2021);(3) that [a solution is "**decades
away**";]{.underline} and (4) that plans for new nuclear in the UK
should be frozen "until we have a geological disposal facility", which
is timetabled for the 2040s but likely to take longer (Laville
2022).Huber and Staﬀord pass over in silence the way that [**[nuclear
power]{.mark}** implies and **[requires a strong state]{.mark}**, [and
its close **connection** with the **military**]{.mark}]{.underline}-- an
omission all the more remarkable, given the occupation since 2022 of
Europe's largest nuclear plant, at Zaporizhzhia, by the Russian army,
which bears responsibility for the collapse of the nearby Kakhovka
hydroplant (Glantz et al. 2023). [[For]{.underline}]{.mark} the rich
tradition of [[socialist writing]{.underline}]{.mark} on tech-nology,
[the [nuclear-military connection is]{.mark} not only about such
"accidents," but [about **deeper**]{.mark}-going **economic and
technological [relationships]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Only nuclear
reactors produce]{.mark} the fissile [material needed for **nuclear
bombs**]{.mark}]{.underline}; [[military imperatives **shape**]{.mark}
**national industrial [supply chains]{.mark}** more broadly; [the
overlaps in **education**]{.mark}, design, **[research]{.mark} and
[security]{.mark}** [are all extensively
researched]{.mark}]{.underline}. Civilian nuclear power has been in
long-term decline due to its high cost, but has proved "surprisingly
resilient" to market conditions in a limited group of countries, due to
this interdependence (Stirling and Johnstone 2018).

Ultimately, [the way [socialist]{.mark}s see [**nuclear power** is bound
up with]{.mark} our [views of]{.mark} potential **[post-capitalist
futures]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Huber and Stafford's vision (2023, 79)
is "of 'big public power', in which the public sector would subsidise
the mass buildout of large-scale zero-carbon energy generation
infrastructure including nuclear power and, where geography suits,
renewables." Against this, I commend the view held by Cullen (2021) that
[[nuclear power is "**antithetical** to the world we want to
see]{.underline}]{.mark}. [From [its origin]{.mark} as a figleaf [to
**distract us** from]{.mark} the grim truth of **[m]{.mark}utually
[a]{.mark}ssured [d]{.mark}estruction**, [to its]{.mark} recent
[resurrection as a **bogus solution** to climate change]{.mark}, [it is
**inherently bound up with violent state forms**]{.mark} and
**paranoid** and **secretive hierarchies."**]{.underline}

Views of nuclear also vary according to our approaches to the transition
away from fossil fuels. The two most vital changes needed are: (1) to
transform the way final energy is used (e.g. by insulating homes to
reduce the need for heating, improving public transport to reduce the
need for cars, and ending wasteful forms of consumption), and (2) to
reduce the throughput of energy in technological systems (e.g. by
replacing gas boilers with heat pumps). The remaining energy required
must be produced with non-fossil-fuel technologies, of which renewables
and nuclear are the most developed. The copious scenario analysis
literature shows that climate change can only be dealt with in the
course of deep-going social transformations (Allwood et al. 2019,
Grubler et al. 2018, van Vuuren et al. 2018). For socialists, these
transformations are bound up with overcoming and superceding capitalism
(Pirani 2018, Pirani, 2023a).

For the present discussion, there are three relevant points that I would
like to emphasise. First, [climate change deprives us of
time]{.underline}. [Nuclear power stations take many years to
build]{.underline}, while decentralised renewable energy systems do not.
Second, the future of electricity networks must be considered in the
context of broader economic changes overshadowed by climate change, and
the need for transforming final energy use and reducing throughput,
mentioned above (in his writing on "degrowth," discussed elsewhere,
Huber (2022, 31--32 and 162--175) has remained agnostic on energy
consumption and throughput scenarios). Third, highly flexible
electricity networks are both necessary for reducing throughput and
transforming final energy use -- and, happily, also facilitate
decentralised renewables. Integrating nuclear power stations that
generate large, unchanging quantities of electricity into such networks
may be less easy.

[[Under]{.mark} the [present political conditions]{.mark}]{.underline},
in which labour movements and social movements are struggling for change
under capitalism, [[choices]{.mark} made by the state [about]{.mark}
which [energy]{.mark} resources to invest in **[do
matter]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Huber and Stafford (2023, 78) advocate
opting for nuclear, despite the extraordinary expense: it "needs
socialism to grow -- or at least a form of public investment that
socialises the costs of construction and does not privatise the gains."
The corollary should be spelled out: resources invested in nuclear would
not be invested in renewables.

Discussions among socialists would benefit from greater attention to the
transition scenarios mentioned above, which afford a way into some of
the social and technological issues. It would also be worthwhile to
develop a socialist critique of "100 percent renewables" scenarios (i.e.
models depicting hypothetical paths towards electricity networks run
solely from renewable electricity, without any fossil fuels or nuclear)
developed by researchers from engineering and scientific backgrounds
(Pirani 2023d). Huber and Stafford, characteristically, dismiss these
scenarios as "largely based on the models of one researcher, Mark Z.
Jacobson." They are mistaken. A recent survey covered the work of some
thirteen research teams (Brown et al. 2018, Heard et al. 2017).

Even with these critiques, renewable energy future is not impossible;
however, two things must be done in order to ensure that these forms of
energy don't end up causing more damage. The first is that we must
invest more time and energy into the research and development of
renewable energy technology in order to produce it in ways that will be
sustainable and environmentally friendly. The second is that [we must
make sure that while we are implementing these technologies, we must do
it in ways that are safe for the communities they are providing for and
extracting from, the people working to produce the energy and the planet
as a whole]{.underline}. [[The **capitalist drive** to cut costs causes
us to **overlook** safety and **environment**]{.mark}**al impact** [in

[[costs]{.underline}]{.mark} that can be externalized [[are thrust

Since the birth of nuclear energy in the late 1940s and early 1950s, it
has been proposed by scientists that we could produce nuclear energy
with materials other than uranium, notably thorium. The idea to use
thorium instead of uranium to produce energy was originally proposed in
the late-1940s, but the government refused to fund research into it
because the process burned excess plutonium, while the government needed
the plutonium to build nuclear weapons during the Cold War. However, as
the climate crisis grows more direr and alternative energy sources are
not progressing fast enough to replace fossil fuels soon, we need to
find a way to power our civilization that is both ecologically friendly
and can meet our energy demands. Thorium-based nuclear energy solves
these problems and more. The first advantage of thorium is that it is
abundant in nature. It is estimated that three times as much thorium on
earth than uranium is available, and currently we have few uses for it,
and it mostly ends up as a waste product, contaminating rivers after
mining rare earth metals. The second advantage to thorium, especially
considering how abundant it is, is that it produces far more energy than
any other current energy source. One tonne of thorium can produce as
much energy as 200 tonnes of uranium, or 3.5 million tonnes of coal.
Also, all thorium is usable for energy, as opposed to the small
percentage of uranium that is usable, and therefore does not require
enrichment, which also saves time and energy in producing the fuel.
Additionally, the waste produced by thorium-based nuclear power needs to
be kept isolated only for a few hundred years, unlike waste products
from uranium reactors which have to be kept isolated for up to hundreds
of thousands of years. Thorium's melting point is also approximately
500°C higher than that of uranium, which provides an extra margin of
safety against meltdowns in reactors. There are still the issues of the
immense initial investment in the construction of power plants, and the
issues of the impact of mining (though mining is likely to continue, so
we might as well use the upturned thorium rather than let it contaminate
rivers), but a dialogue around thorium and nuclear energy should be
happening.

Capitalism has turned uranium from a nuisance into a valuable commodity.
[The capitalist drive for cheap sources of energy turned uranium into
nuclear energy, but [the **need for profit** kept capitalism from
turning nuclear energy into a]{.mark} practically [free]{.mark},
practically limitless [resource]{.mark} for the people to
use.]{.underline} [[Capitalist cost-cutting]{.mark} and externalizing
damages [have turned **nuclear energy** into]{.mark} one of **the [most
taboo forms of energy]{.mark} in the world**.]{.underline} [[The need to
**exploit impoverished peoples** for cheap labour fuelled
colonialism]{.mark} in the four corners region of the United
States.]{.underline} [[Capitalism]{.mark} and production for profit have
[turned]{.mark}]{.underline} uranium, and all [sources of
[energy]{.mark}, [into]{.mark} questions of cost-efficiency and
[marketability rather than a question of
**resource-efficiency**]{.mark}, safety [and human
need.]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}The ['irregular warfare' of
American]{.underline} colonialism [led to the creation of nuclear
weapons]{.underline} out of uranium. [[The possibility of **nuclear
immolation**]{.mark} is all-too-real of a fear, and it is one that [is
the culmination of]{.mark} over [500 years of
**colonialism**.]{.mark}]{.underline} And not only did colonialism fuel
the conception of the weaponry, but [it is through colonialism that
people were able to]{.underline} obtain the uranium to [build the
weaponry.]{.underline} Exploiting the labour of Navajo people in the
four corners and of African people in Shinkolobwe would fuel the uranium
bombs that would be dropped on Japan in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well
as the nuclear arsenals of the superpowers that played a dangerous game
of chess with 'third world' countries during the Cold War. Uranium has
the potential for so much good and so much harm to the biosphere. The
radioactivity and chemical toxicity of uranium requires that it be
carefully handled and used so that it does not cause damage to
ecological and human health. But currently the prospects of replacing
fossil fuels otherwise are looking slim. [[Institutions such as
**capitalism** and **the state** have made nuclear power]{.mark}
dangerous and [**destructive**,]{.mark} [by producing power for **profit
rather than for safety**]{.mark}, to meet human needs [and to liberate
us from]{.mark} the chains of [fossil fuels]{.mark}.]{.underline} If we
wish to develop other forms of alternative energy to their fullest
capacity, and [[if we wish to use nuclear energy]{.mark} to safely power
our civilization, [we must **abandon**]{.mark} **centralization and [the
profit motive]{.mark}**, and we must produce communally, through
participatory planning, and for human need.]{.underline} Uranium has a
long, complex and dark past: a past of colonialism, imperialism and
environmental destruction. But uranium is not inherently evil, it is
merely a radioactive element with ninety-two protons and isotopes
ranging from U-233 to U-238. It is through the process of
commodification and exploitation for the benefit of the few at the
expense of the many that uranium, like many other things, becomes a tool
for evil. Uranium may have a dark past, but if we can move past
capitalism and promote ideas of non-hierarchical social organization and
ecological principles, perhaps it can have a better future (or perhaps
it will be abandoned altogether, but a dialogue must happen, and we must
think outside of capitalism while it happens).

Whereas such global interest in Arctic resources is by no means new, the
scale and dynamics of globalization in the Arctic is increasingly
intensive (Heininen and Southcott 2010). For the past four centuries,
access to the Arctic has meant access to natural resources and, at each
given point in time, the Arctic supplied raw materials that fueled
accelerating historical industrialization in Europe, and later in the
North America, and Soviet Union. The logic of resource consumption from
deposits distant from the industrial centers that transform them into
commodities is also, arguably, the primary logic of globalization as a
process of 'materio-spatial expansions and intensifications, which are
driven by historically reiterated economies of scale made possible by
technology' (Bunker and Ciccantell 2005: 9). [The [perception of the
Arctic as **a global resource base**]{.mark} that has been perpetuated
for centuries not only [allows for the integration of the Arctic into
the **global economy**]{.mark}, but also [accentuates **resource
colonialism** as a set of economic strategies underlying]{.mark}
**post-industrial [capitalism]{.mark}**.]{.underline} However, if the
questions of Arctic energy development are both economic and political
in nature then important questions remain about who should benefit from
Arctic resource development and who should decide upon the future of
Arctic exploration particularly in relation to the need to maintain the
sustainability of its environment.

[[The image of a **remote**]{.mark}**, inhospitable**, poorly
accessible, [yet resourceful Arctic can be compared to]{.mark} the
legend of **[El Dorado]{.mark}**, a mythical place where **unspoken
wealth** can be rapidly acquired.]{.underline} An illustration can be
obtained from a 17th-century Arctic trade colony, Mangazeya, founded by
Cossacks from Tobolsk on the Taz River. Mangazeya was referred to as
'gold-boiling', as it accumulated furs, walrus tusks and other valuable
goods to be shipped out to European Russia and Western Europe (Belov et
al. 1980). Similarly 'El Dorado' imaginaries can be found in
representations of Svalbard, Alaska and Yukon, Yakutia, Yamal, and, most
recently, the Arctic Ocean seabed and its biomass (Young 2010). However,
today more skeptical commentators have started to question the financial
viability of future large-scale Arctic exploration, warning that the
'fantastic opportunities' are based upon a mixture of sketchy
information, unproven models and geopolitical ambitions. Indeed, the
high cost of Arctic oil and gas production coupled with the growing
viability of alternative energy sources and the recent global drop in
oil prices have significantly undermined interest in Arctic energy
development for many private investors. Yet, plans for Arctic energy
have not been completely abandoned at the state level in Norway or
Russia and, after Trump's election, are starting to re-appear in the US.
This begs the question of whether Arctic energy development can
eventually be profitable and why states maintain their pursuit of Arctic
hydrocarbons?

Although there has been significant technological progress in the past
30 years, possibilities for exploration of Arctic oil and gas deposits
as commercially profitable ventures remain restricted (Budzik 2009).
Infrastructure for resource extraction and transportation constitutes
the most significant cost factor in Arctic energy development. It has
been estimated that the average cost of oil production in the Arctic is
USD75 per barrel, whereas in the Middle East (Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran)
a barrel equivalent costs around USD10 and in the Russian West Siberian
fields around USD20 (Bashir 2015; Wall Street Journal 2016). Offshore
development in the Arctic is subject to significant expenses, including
costly ice management that requires satellite monitoring and icebreaking
capacity. Indeed private energy companies that lack adequate resources
need to cooperate with state-owned providers, as is currently the case
for Norway and Russia, to receive support in ice management. Personnel
costs are also high, as Arctic production requires wages that attract
professionals to work in remote and isolated locations and to commit to
shift work. The need to determine national boundaries and land use
rights also has an effect upon the cost of developing Arctic deposits.
With regard to estimating the profitability of Arctic energy development
governance and regulatory issues to do with licensing, subsidies,
taxation and funding are also crucial, whilst state and market actor
groups find themselves in highly interdependent relations with each
another. Four out of the five Arctic littoral countries, Russia being
the odd one out, do not have restrictions on foreign equity
participation in their oil and gas sectors. From this point of view the
Arctic is attractive to international oil and gas companies, as access
to resources in other resource-rich parts of the world can be limited by
the dominance of national energy companies. Additionally, most Arctic
nation states could not benefit from the expensive exploration of the
Arctic resources without the participation of private capital. Yet,
private companies interested in Arctic hydrocarbons are, in turn,
dependent on licensing policies (which have often been restrictive due
to environmental concerns), tax arrangements (the US, Canada, Greenland,
and Norway have profit-based regimes, whereas Russia has a revenue-based
tax regime), and subsidies (lower tax rate for offshore production and
assets to attract capital investment) (Aalto and Jaakkola 2015).

Currently, oil and gas production takes place in the Arctic zones of
Russia, the US (Alaska), Canada (Northwest Territories), and Norway. A
closer look into these cases reveals that despite a wide variety of
actors' strategies and regulatory contexts, they have one unifying
element: the significance of the public sector in providing
infrastructural support for the projects. Due to permafrost conditions
and long distances, the land connectivity by road and rail remains poor
in the Arctic and, thus, the primary means of transportation for Arctic
oil and gas is pipeline connection and shipping. An 800 mile long
Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS), completed in 1977 as a joint
venture of eight energy companies, connects vast oil reserves in Prudhoe
Bay to port Valdez, but it would not have been possible without
financial incentives from the state (Conley 2013). In Canada, the
federal government took a one-third financial interest in the
construction of a pipeline connecting Northwest Territories (Norman
Wells) to Zama in Alberta (Hamilton 1994: 203). In the Soviet Union,
between 1973--1986, a number of major pipeline projects were completed
in order to connect oil and gas fields in Northwestern Siberia and Komi
Republic to the European part of Russia and Western Europe. The state
was the sole financer and owner of this infrastructure given that the
Soviet Union was, for most of this time period, a planned economy. Other
large infrastructural projects have, however, remained only on paper.
These include the Alaskan Gas Pipeline to commercialize Alaska's North
Slope Natural gas, The Mackenzie Valley Pipeline, proposed to transport
natural gas from the Beaufort Sea through Canada's Northwest Territories
to northern Alberta, and The Power of Siberia, envisioned as a unified
gas transmission system for the Irkutsk and Yakutia gas production
centers to Vladivostok and further to Asian markets, leaving large
Arctic fields undeveloped.

These [Arctic infrastructure projects]{.underline}, realized through
sets of opaque and complex contracts between private investors and
governments, [highlight both how and the degree to which states and
markets are intertwined in Arctic energy development.]{.underline}
Despite decades of economic liberalization and privatization of the
energy sector, both in Western democracies and to some degree in Russia,
the degree to which state actors are involved in energy markets remains
significant. Yamal LNG, an industrial complex constructed during
2013--2016 for exploration, liquefaction and shipment of natural gas, is
another case in point. As the project has faced significant cost
overruns, the operating company Novatek had to secure additional funding
through credits from state-controlled Sberbank and Gazprombank, as well
as the Chinese Silk Fund which provided a 1.2 billion USD loan in
connection with that company's acquisition of a 9.9 percent stake in the
project (The Independent Barents Observer 2016). In the Arctic, Russia's
geopolitical leverage over energy is reflected through the increasing
prevalence of a securitization discourse in domestic politics and in the
media (Gritsenko and Tynkkynen 2016). More generally, Kuzemko (2014)
argued that [[energy is a]{.mark} particular [policy area where the
engagement of the state]{.mark} policymaking actors [has
increased]{.mark} over decades [as a result of **increasing
securitization**]{.mark}**,** or including energy issues into the scope
of national security concerns.]{.underline}

Comprehensive Arctic strategies adopted first by Arctic, and later by
non-Arctic states, focus on generating an Arctic extractive economy, but
so far the result of these political strategies has been an expansion of
state economic activity through infrastructure development. In the
historical analysis of extractive industries, Bunker and Ciccantell
(2005) argue that most of the grand extractive projects would not have
been possible without strong state support in the form of infrastructure
development. These examples from the Arctic suggest that political
issues interact heavily with economic factors to determine energy
transportation, such as pipelines, ports, and sea-lanes. This
energyrelated infrastructure not only incorporates the local into the
global, serving as means of political influence and geopolitical
competition, but also has a political impact at the local level in
regional policy and planning. Since traditional lifestyles pursued by
many Arctic indigenous peoples depend on reindeer herding and fisheries,
tensions are likely to arise when pasture areas shrink due to
infrastructure construction and maintenance, as well as raising levels
of industrial pollution that negatively affect fish populations. Thus, a
relevant concern is that the construction of energy-related
infrastructure, as a part of large-scale industrialization of the High
North pursued by some Arctic states, may set a path for future Arctic
development that will directly contradict policies aimed at social and
environmental sustainability

The first wave of intensive commercial interest in Arctic oil and gas
started in the 1970s and accelerated in response to the first oil crisis
of 1973, when considerations of energy security promoted and enabled
expensive projects, such as the Trans-Alaskan pipeline. Following the
1979 crisis, Norway opened up the north of the Norwegian Sea for further
oil and gas exploration. As already mentioned, the most recent
millennial optimism about Arctic hydrocarbon exploration can be
interpreted as a continuation of these dynamics (Avango and Högselius
2013). It was prompted by a combination of steady increases in oil
prices during the 2000s, concerns over energy security related to
tensions in EU--Russia energy relations, melting ice due to climate
change, and the promise of 'Arctic riches' after the publication of the
USGS 2008. In the past 200 years, temperatures in the Arctic have
escalated more than any other region on earth. In the interdependent
global climate system, these Arctic changes are very likely to have
detrimental effects on the rest of the world (Vihma 2014). Thus, climate
change is not only an opportunity for large-scale resource extraction in
the Arctic, but also a challenge to Arctic and global sustainability
which, in its turn, can reduce viability for Arctic energy development
(Harsem et al. 2011).

In this way, the recent spate of interest in Arctic mineral wealth marks
a contradictory relationship between energy and environmental discourses
(Palosaari and Tynkkynen 2015). The ambitious international goal of
limiting global warming to below 2°C, adopted at the 2015 Paris Climate
Conference (COP21), infers a concrete need for a global energy
transition. This in turn, given the best available knowledge on the
dynamics of climate change, is incompatible with hydrocarbon development
in the Arctic. Up until today, the Arctic has been a 'net energy
exporter' whilst the local use of energy, even in the form of fossil
fuels, has made only a marginal contribution to world greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions, particularly in comparison to the use of Arctic-origin
oil and gas elsewhere in the world. Thus the Arctic has been placed at
the heart of climate debates, but effectively has little to offer the
global energy transition besides 'remaining untouched'. What makes its
position more problematic is that whether it remains untouched or not is
a decision over which 'the Arctic' itself, as the region above the
Arctic Circle, has little decision-making power.

Disconnecting Arctic from global energy flows, however, goes against the
dominant and embedded colonial logic that has promoted Arctic
exploration for the past four centuries. [[**Resource colonialism**
manifests itself]{.mark} not only through extending extractive
frontiers, but also [through interpreting **industrialization** as a
form of **development** that benefits extractive communities by
**resolving economic under-development**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Bunker
and Ciccantell 2005). [[Energy companies]{.mark} in the Arctic have
largely adopted a developmentalist rhetoric that [view]{.mark}s [the
industrialization of the Arctic as '**bringing civilization'**]{.mark},
primarily in the form of infrastructure, [to the remote communities in
the region]{.mark} and thereby increasing social well-being]{.underline}
(Tynkkynen 2016). Tynkkynen has explained this rhetoric as [a
manifestation of 'energopower']{.underline} (ibid.). In its ultimate
form, [the argument promulgated by the energy companies suggests that
abandoning Arctic energy projects will throw the region and its
communities back into an 'underdeveloped' state and increase the
vulnerability of local communities.]{.underline} However, by
highlighting the role of capital and technology as a way to ensure a
balance between socio-economic and environmental aspects of Arctic
development, this interpretation subordinates the Arctic periphery to
'the center' whilst neglecting the many contradictions between resource
extraction and sustainable development highlighted above.

Put another way, the decisions taken were dictated by the prime

necessary. Cut whatever corners you need to, bribe and cajole whoever is

higher power to which you will answer other than the God of Profit. This

THE RESPONSE by the people of Japan has been tremendous and
inspiring. Tens of thousands have regularly picketed government and
corporate offices and 7.5 million people have signed a petition against
the restarting of any of the 54 idled reactors that have been kept
shuttered due to this massive and unprecedented outpouring of activism,
organizing and anger. A new anti-nuclear movement is being born from
below.

As of May, the people of Japan celebrated the shutdown of the last of
the 54 Japanese reactors, even as there were no power cuts. Our power
defeated the nuclear power! People's joy was short-lived, however.
[Despite the "setback" of the Fukushima nuclear
disaster]{.underline}--which should now surely be described at the very
least as a disaster-waiting-to-happen, [nuclear corporations are not
throwing in the towel and admitting that nuclear power has got to
go.]{.underline}

Through a carefully orchestrated media campaign of fear-mongering based
on the threat of power cuts and government announcements about the
dangers that a lack of electricity poses to Japan's fragile economy,
they have managed to successfully argue for the restart of reactors in
the Western industrial region around Osaka. In a rare televised appeal
to the Japanese public, the new Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, who is
entirely pro-nuclear, made the case for the necessary restarts.

However, in another new piece of evidence that should halt all talk of
restarts, the NAIIC report notes that it cannot say whether the
earthquake itself--not the tsunami--was partly responsible for the
reactor meltdowns. This finding invalidates the "stress tests" that the
nuclear plants have undergone to show they are safe to operate--because
those tests were based on the assumption that it was only the tsunami,
not the earthquake, which caused the structural problems and loss of
power at the plant.

Meanwhile, a separate government panel of experts has declared that,
based on what happened with the tsunami from the March 11
earthquake, tsunamis of 112 feet in height are possible along the
Pacific coast. Every single one of Japan's 54 nuclear reactors is
situated along the coast!

The tsunami that overwhelmed the Fukushima-Daiichi plant and swept away
entire villages in the area, causing 19,000 deaths, was 45 feet high,
less than half of what the panel now predicts as possible. A 2003 report
had put the maximum size of a tsunami in the area at 60 feet, but
clearly, a 45-foot wave can overwhelm coastal defenses and inundate
nuclear plants such as the one at Fukushima-Daiichi, which was only
prepared for a 20-foot-high wave.

-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

THE ONLY rational answer is to permanently shut down all the reactors,
break apart and dismantle the nuclear corporations as threats to public
health, take further measures to conserve electricity and speed up the
program of building the infrastructure necessary for a clean energy
economy.

However, there are a few broader conclusions to draw from this report
and the litany of similar cases of accidents such as the BP spill, where
the corporate drive for profit is like an unstoppable tsunami that
tolerates all manner of evasions and cutbacks regarding health and
safety measures.

First, this is not about a few bad apples or irresponsible, corrupt
people. This is about how capitalism operates. How else does one explain
the need for every single area of capital accumulation--from the nuclear
industry, to oil and gas, to pharmaceuticals to food production--to have
independent regulators preventing the corporations from doing what they
are primed to do: make profit at all costs? If the regulators are in the
pockets of the corporations that bestride the planet as unaccountable
behemoths with their colossal economies, often larger than most
individual states, all hell breaks loose.

Second, whatever those deluded environmentalists who are pro-nuclear
think, [there is no scenario in which a sane person can be pro-nuclear
when the [**nuke plants** are operating within a social system that has
**no ethical, social, ecological**]{.mark} **or moral
[concerns]{.mark}**, and **drives** the **individuals** who run the
system **into immoral actions**.]{.underline} The only thing crazier
than boiling water by splitting atoms is boiling water by splitting
atoms in a social system driven by profit.

Five years ago, the great leftist social and ecological thinker and
activist Barry [Commoner was asked]{.underline} in a *New York
Times* interview [whether the environmentalists who have now turned to
nuclear power as an answer to global warming had a point]{.underline}.
He answered:

[No]{.underline}. [This is a]{.underline} good [example of shortsighted
environmentalism.]{.underline} It superficially makes sense to say,
"Here's a way of producing energy without carbon dioxide." [But **every
activity** that increases the amount of **radioactivity** to which we
are exposed **is idiotic**]{.underline}. There has to be a
life-and-death reason to do it. I mean, we haven't solved the problem of
waste yet. We still have used fuel sitting all over the place. I think
the fact that some people who have established a reputation as
environmentalists have adopted this is appalling.

Third, within capitalism, there are certain essential economic
activities which need to be thought of as they were before the
acceleration of the capitalist orthodoxy of deregulation and
privatization that occurred with the birth of neoliberalism 30 years
ago--before the drive for privatization that necessitated the
evisceration of the organized power of the working class, as the balance
of class forces was forcibly tilted toward the corporations and away
from us.

There were certain activities where we are not seen as customers for a
commodity that we buy from a for-profit corporation, but rather as
citizens, with a right to a service from the government that we elect to
represent our interests. Examples of such essential services are the
provision of education, access to water, health care, a pension, public
transportation--the most basic attributes for a productive and healthy
life and a functioning society.

This idea must also extend to the provision of electricity--not just
because it is fundamental to the way we live, but, just as importantly,
for ecological reasons.

We need to conserve electricity and energy use in general and set up
systems to ensure that there is a nationally organized program to do so.
However, that will never happen with electricity production when the
utilities are privately owned. Private electric utilities make more
money the more electricity they sell us. So having consumers use less
would be counter-productive and irrational from a corporate perspective.
If they're regulated and offered incentives to sell us less, they just
charge more for each individual unit and pass the costs on. Furthermore,
[[corporations are always going to spend **as little as they
can**]{.mark} **get away with** on infrastructure, safety and
maintenance, [as illustrated to a **horrific extent** by the **nuclear
catastrophe in Japan**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Electricity should be a service that is publically provided, not a
commodity to be bought. In other words, we need to renationalize the
electricity grid and see it as an opportunity to build a new energy
infrastructure, one that is efficient and has at its heart energy
conservation, based around alternative sources of energy. Not outdated,
dirty and dangerous 19th and 20th century technologies, such as coal,
oil, gas or uranium, but clean, renewable--and safe--wind, solar and
geothermal sources. These are energy sources that Japan and United
States, have in great abundance.

organized under the]{.underline} banner of the [People's Movement
Against Nuclear Energy]{.underline} (**[PMANE]{.underline}**) [and the
Indian government.]{.underline}

The Indian state is determined, despite Fukushima, to increase its
reliance on nuclear power tenfold, so that it represents 25 percent of
electricity production. This in a country where almost half the
population, 400 million people, lack access to electricity and
decades-old Indian wind turbines produce twice as much electricity as
current Indian nuclear plants that have already received billions of
dollars in funding. If these wind turbines alone were upgraded, let
along building more modern ones or taking advantage of the plentiful
solar energy that India basks in, they could supply a much larger
segment of electricity and obviate the need for the nuclear plants.

Due to the growth and persistence of the Indian activists' struggle, the
state is becoming increasingly violent, dispatching thousands of troops
to put down protests. [The response by]{.underline} PMANE and [the

[building more nuclear plants]{.underline} deserves to be quoted at some
length:

The day after the Tamil Nadu state by-elections last March...Chief
Minister Selvi J. Jayalalithaa suddenly reversed her earlier decision to
support the protesters, dispatching at least 6,000 police and
paramilitary to the region. For three days, the government prevented
essential supplies--including tankers of water and milk--from reaching
the PMANE base in Idinthikarai, a coastal village about two kilometers
from the Koodankulam reactors.

But nearby fishing [communities sympathized with the
protesters]{.underline} at Idinthikarai [and sent in boats of
supplies]{.underline} for them. In an unprecedented display of
solidarity, traditional local women also took to boats to reach the
village. [Residents blocked roads en masse, preventing police from
arresting the movement's coordinators.]{.underline}

[This is the kind of **heroic solidarity** actions and **mass movement**
we **need to build in the United States**]{.underline} and in every part
of the globe.

But finally, if the system really is pathological in its operation, as I
would argue it is, then the only solution is to uproot it in its
entirety and replace it with something that we can jointly and
collectively create--a social and economic system that places people and
the planet before profit.

Ultimately, this means a system where there is no profit, where we
cooperate to democratically plan out what we need to produce and how
we're going to produce it with, to use Marx's words, the "least possible
expenditure of energy."

[[The stepping stones]{.underline}]{.mark} along the path
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} that [fundamental [transformation
**require**]{.mark} the building of [a mass **social**]{.mark} **and
ecological** [justice **movement**]{.mark} that fights for **real

**abandonment of**]{.mark} **the destructive and costly insanity of
[nuclear power]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the eradication of fossil
fuel-derived energy that is destabilizing global climate. But a movement
that simultaneously aims for a revolutionary reordering of power.

While acknowledging the value of Marx\'s conceptualization of primitive
accumulation, scholars have taken issue with its temporal, geographical,
and social occlusions. [First, describing these foundational processes
of dispossession as 'primitive' or 'original' erroneously relegates them
to the past and implies that their violent tactics are likewise no
longer at play]{.underline}
(Harvey, [2004](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gec3.12731#gec312731-bib-0048);
Zarembka, [2002](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gec3.12731#gec312731-bib-0131)).
Meanwhile, by centering his analysis in England, Marx elided the ways
that **[[capital accumulation]{.mark} was [wholly intertwined with and
dependent upon]{.mark} slavery and [colonialism]{.mark}
abroad]{.underline}**
(Bhambra, [2021](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gec3.12731#gec312731-bib-0010);
Johnson, [2004](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gec3.12731#gec312731-bib-0062);
Wolfe, [2006](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gec3.12731#gec312731-bib-0129)).
The limitations of Marx\'s spatial focus were mirrored in his devotion
to the proletariat, which severely diminished his consideration of other
subjects of capitalism. While European workers could potentially be
unified through class struggle, colonial plantation economies---and the
dizzying levels of commodity production and profit maximization they
realized---hinged on the codification of racialized difference among
laborers
(Virdee, [2019](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gec3.12731#gec312731-bib-0120)).
Accordingly,
Coulthard ([2014](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gec3.12731#gec312731-bib-0027))
argues for centering the subject position of the colonized rather than
the wage worker, who has hitherto been the focal figure of Marxist
scholarship (cf.
Das, [2017](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gec3.12731#gec312731-bib-0029)).

[Efforts to complicate and expand Marx\'s theory along temporal,
spatial, and social lines have been complemented by work aimed at
understanding the [environmental consequences of **capital
accumulation**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} One subset of this
scholarship documents how [colonialism and primitive accumulation **[set
climate change in motion]{.mark}** by extracting the initial capital for
subsequent accumulation [through]{.mark} expanded
reproduction]{.underline}

Eduardo
Galeano ([1971](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gec3.12731#gec312731-bib-0042)),
for instance, notes that 18th century London received up to £50,000
(equivalent to ∼£9,000,000 or ∼ US\$10,500,000 today) of Brazilian gold
per week. In South Asia, Britain siphoned approximately US\$45 trillion
from India between 1765 and 1938 (Chakrabarti &
Patnaik, [2018](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gec3.12731#gec312731-bib-0022)).
[The rapacious [extraction of resources and]{.mark} [decimation of
Indigenous peoples abroad]{.mark}, coupled with primitive accumulation
at home, led to the simultaneous enrichment of imperial states and
impoverishment of colonies]{.underline}
(Moe-Lobeda, [2016](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gec3.12731#gec312731-bib-0084)).
They also provided the financial stimulus for fossil-fueled
industrialization by enabling millowners to invest in costly coal-fired
steam engines and thereby overcome labor and geographical constraints to
production
(Malm, [2016](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gec3.12731#gec312731-bib-0076)).
[Beyond their treatment as vast stores of resources, [the rest of the
world]{.mark} also [became repositories of atmospheric, terrestrial, and
aquatic waste]{.mark} as colonial powers churned through their
ill-gotten wealth. One assessment of historical greenhouse gas emissions
(1860--2015) finds [the G-8 countries]{.mark} (United States, European
Union, Russia, Japan, and Canada) [responsible]{.mark} [for]{.mark} 85%
of excess emissions, a process that Jason Hickel terms '[atmospheric
colonization']{.mark}]{.underline}
(Hickel, [2020](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gec3.12731#gec312731-bib-0052)).
Colonial [powers thus [became the world\'s largest economies at the
expense of both colonized territories and the global
atmosphere]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Moreover, the [extreme wealth and power disparities]{.mark} resulting
from colonial racial capitalism [established]{.mark} the conditions for
highly [uneven geographies of vulnerability to climate change]{.mark}
impacts]{.underline}
(Sultana, [2022](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gec3.12731#gec312731-bib-0108);

[Heightened sensitivity to climate change derives from colonial
histories of wealth expropriation]{.underline}, as well as ongoing
dynamics of indebtedness, structural dependency, and appropriation
through unequal exchange (Hickel
et al., [2021](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gec3.12731#gec312731-bib-0053);

Sealey-Huggins, [2017](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gec3.12731#gec312731-bib-0101)).
Inequalities in climate risk between and within states are apparent, for
example, in the differential quality of infrastructure, which can either
mitigate or magnify damages associated with extreme weather events
(Parks & Timmons
Roberts, [2006](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gec3.12731#gec312731-bib-0093);
Sheller and
León, [2016](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gec3.12731#gec312731-bib-0102)).

Unequal exposure and sensitivity to climate change are undeniable
realities of the contemporary configuration of (settler) colonial and
post-colonial states, and addressing uneven vulnerability to climate
change is a top priority of climate justice scholarship and activism.
[However]{.mark}, [[emphasizing]{.mark} the [disproportionate impacts of
climate change on marginalized groups]{.mark} can
**[inadvertently]{.mark} [reinforce]{.mark}** a
**[developmentalism]{.mark}** **[built on racialized understandings
of]{.mark}** the Global South (and of [**minoritized** **communities in
the Global North**)]{.mark}]{.underline} [[as 'behind,' 'failed,' and in
need of intervention]{.underline}]{.mark} (see

Koshy
et al., [2022](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gec3.12731#gec312731-bib-0069)).
Not only do occupied and formerly colonized areas suffer worse
consequences from climate change, but their designation as vulnerable
and requiring adaptation may perpetuate colonial relations and subject
them to further exploitation (Cameron 2012, Lindroth &
Sinevaara-Niskanen, [2014](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gec3.12731#gec312731-bib-0074),

is this latter set of dynamics that I seek to unpack through a survey of
adaptation and accumulation within colonial racial capitalism. Here, I
take up Bhambra and Newell\'s (2022: 1) call "for caution and precision
in the invocation of colonialism within climate change debates" by
cataloging the colonial racial capitalist mechanisms by which
accumulation by adaptation unfolds.

[[We cannot separate capitalism from colonialism]{.mark}, and what's
more, we cannot separate imperialism from either capitalism or
colonialism]{.underline}. The three are synonymous with each other and
are outgrowths of the same racial, socioeconomic, and class oppressive
apparatuses that wield the lash of US hegemony. This [began with the
colonization of Indigenous lands globally by imperial forces from Spain,
France, and England, and has resulted in the United States empire which
occupies not just land, but also the psyche of all working
people]{.underline}. The global power of modern-day imperialism is
seated here in the United States whose reach has ravaged the world,
especially in "Latin American" countries. This has generated a crisis
caused by sanctions, and puppet governments implanted by American
imperialists, forcing mass migrations of Indigenous people from
Honduras, Columbia, and Guatemala to the US border to seek asylum. The
battle against (neo) colonialism is a battle against capitalism and
imperialism. [[The battle against these forces is the fight against
climate change]{.mark}, [the destruction of Native culture and
land]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} ultimately our struggle for
[liberation]{.mark} on a large scale! ]{.underline}

John Trudell (Santee Sioux Tribe) was excellent at reminding us that our
ultimate objective is to reclaim and maintain our humanity. Native
liberation means that by honoring and celebrating our Indigeneity we are
in fact proclaiming our humanity. [[We must see]{.mark} ourselves in
[the greater struggle against imperialism]{.mark} [and its
tenements]{.mark}]{.underline}. While many will disagree with this
notion, as they don't see Indigenous people as a part of proletarian
struggle and view class liberation outside of Native concern, I offer
the reality that decolonization must be inclusive to all oppressed
people if it is to be successful and worthwhile. When Frantz Fanon wrote
of the Algerian fight to liberate themselves from French colonialism in
his revolutionary book The Wretched of The Earth, he made it clear that
the struggle was for both Arabic and Black workers. He clearly
illustrated the trauma and pain caused by settler colonialism on the
entirety of the Algerian people. Today, we see the rise of Indian
farmers and workers fight against the ruling class in India as a mass
movement for socialist change in their environs. We must also take great
note of the impressive Native movement in Bolivia. There we saw Evo
Morales, an Indigenous leader who embraced Marxist/Leninist ideas and
applied them to the Indigenous material conditions of his people. They
were not only able to successfully establish a workers' state but they
also sustained a coup performed by reactionary forces and overthrew
imperialist infiltration of their government through the power of the
people. 

The axiom here is that without a cross-national, inclusive, and
multi-disciplinary approach to liberation, there can be no true praxis
for decolonization; this is because if the focus is exclusively on
Native struggles only, we may fail to see the overarching powers of
imperialism at home and isolate the movement to identity. [This is not
to say that [Natives should]{.mark} give up our [struggle for
self-determination]{.mark} and simply hand over the reins of our
movement to others, but rather to [strategize and orient the gaze of
Native liberation to the larger goal of smashing
imperialism]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is so that the scope of our
struggle extends beyond settler borders, especially to Native nations in
the global south. What's more, we must see how Native liberation applies
to the Indigenous people of Africa who are presently witnessing growing
operations of the U.S. military on their ancestral lands. Imperialism is
no respecter of international borders, nor should we!

Some twenty years ago, in a nondescript conference room with high

cry while discussing climate change]{.underline}. This Elder and [her
[community]{.mark} have been [living on the land]{.mark}---and existing
off of it---[for eons]{.mark}]{.underline}. [She [described
changes]{.mark} many of us would find too subtle to notice---changes
[in]{.mark} seasonal [migration patterns]{.mark}; changes in stark
contrast to their memories before the impact of [chemical
pollution]{.mark}, which has thinned the eggshells of native birds;
changes since [spring]{.mark} started [arriving too]{.mark}
[early]{.mark}, [thawing]{.mark} the [ice]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
[putting]{.mark} the **[community]{.mark} [at
risk]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As an Alaska Native (Denaakk'e) myself, I'd
listened to Elders tell similar stories, but this moment is crystallized
in my mind for [its juxtaposition between an Indigenous worldview and
the western contemporary environment it was being shared
in]{.underline}. The Elder had traveled from home to the ￼National
Tribal Conference on Environmental Management in Reno, Nevada, to share
her story. She was doing more to combat climate change two decades ago
than most people care to do today, despite the plethora of scientific
evidence showing catastrophic climate change, as well as the fires,
tornados, and temperature changes that nearly everyone is experiencing.
[[For]{.mark} [Indigenous Peoples]{.mark} around the world, [climate
change has]{.mark} [long been more than an abstract, futuristic
possibility]{.mark}. [It has been]{.mark} a [reality]{.mark} affecting
the harvesting of our traditional foods and our ability to hunt and
fish, affecting our ability to live on our ancestral homelands, and
changing a way of life that we have been living since time
immemorial.]{.underline} The importance of an Indigenous worldview is
illuminated by the impacts of climate change, and [climate change is
[exacerbated by the western world's historic and **contemporary
reliance** on **imperialistic endeavors**]{.mark} to extract resources
in the name [of capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. But we cannot drink oil
nor can we eat money. Indeed, [Elders all over Turtle Island tell
stories of a time to come when [the world will be forced to]{.mark}

[[We cannot talk about sustainability without]{.mark} [also]{.mark}
talking about access, [labor, and capital]{.mark}]{.underline}. And
while we recognize it's not easy to balance so many different forms of
access and need ― financial, physical, racial, environmental ― for
ourselves, for people we want to support, for workers, and for the
global ecosystem, [we often find that [these discussions]{.mark} focus
in on one or two points of contention but [rarely center indigenous
perspectives]{.mark}, the access needs of individuals or groups trying
to claw out a livable life for themselves, [or the structural]{.mark}
and destructive nature [of capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Capitalism turns everything]{.mark} into an [unsustainable]{.mark}
industry because it can't survive unless it constantly
expands.]{.underline} Capitalist businesses need to grow quickly and
indefinitely or be out-paced by their competitors and die, so they
resort to extreme forms of extraction in order to survive. Food,
housing, clothing, medicine, education, transportation, if there is a
human need or desire, capitalism will find a way to exploit it ― and the
requirement for unlimited growth and industrialization of human needs is
incompatible with finite resources.

[[No amount of "green]{.mark}," "organic," or "ethical"
[consumption]{.mark} [will defeat racial]{.mark} fascist
[capitalism]{.mark} either because every example of consumer activism
fails to identify capitalism as the problem.]{.underline} Instead, it
shifts the conversation around sustainability to a matter of consumer
choice. Each time we are duped into moving capitalism's problems around
instead of resolving them ― instead of recognizing capitalist ideology
itself must be unlearned, and that we will have to take back the land
and resources the capitalist class hoarded and manipulated to accumulate
wealth.

Often we hear "Well if people would stop this or that, then the
rainforest wouldn't be burning." As our anti-fascist, indigenous
comrades point out, just because people eat less meat or drink less
bottled water doesn't mean capitalists and fascists are going to give
native peoples their land back ― or respect them. Capitalists will
simply use the land in some other way to generate profit, either by
stripping it for timber, developing agribusiness on it, building
property on it, drilling into it, or simply holding it to create
scarcity. They will never give it back ― and they will never stop trying
to take more.

[Capitalism also relies on the maintenance of the status
quo.]{.underline} By tying our lives to wage-labor, capitalism limits
our options, forces us to live in contradiction, punishes our attempts
at self-sufficiency, and makes us reliant on consumption to live.
Whether [[through]{.mark} inhibiting education, increasing the cost of
purchasing nutritious food, **[dictating the use of land that was stolen
from indigenous peoples]{.mark}**, or depleting our time to cook a
nutritious meal after a long day of wage labor,]{.underline} we are all
forced to compete against each other through the artificial scarcity
created by capitalism.

Through alienation, capitalism also disappears the labor that goes into
production and the brutality towards workers, land, and animals.
[[Global resources and ecosystems have been disrupted to produce and
sell cash crops, clothing, water, housing, etc]{.underline}]{.mark}.
There is absolutely a history of violence behind most of the things in
our homes because all things are created by labor, so, at best,
everything we purchase has been created through stolen wages. At some
level, we are ALL coerced into unethical consumption and production in
order to survive.

[[Climate change]{.mark}, and the environmental catastrophes occuring
around the globe]{.underline}, weren't caused by ― and won't be fixed by
ending ― single issues like meat consumption. [We [are here as a
result]{.mark} of centuries of violently imposed racial capitalism,
[imperialism]{.mark}, slavery, [and indigenous]{.mark}
[genocide]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It's the outcome of reckless capitalist
resource extraction to create goods for consumers who are forced out of
their native lands only to spend the majority of their time working for
a wage as employees of the capitalist class.]{.underline}

Imagine trying to stop a river with a teaspoon. That's what we are doing
when we try to solve the structural violence and unsustainability of
capitalism with individual lifestyle changes. [[The ultimate form of
sustainability is ending capitalism]{.mark} as an ideology and breaking
capitalist control over our lives and resources; it's ending violence
against indigenous people through total land repatriation and
decolonization]{.underline}; it's abolishing the wage-labor that makes
us dependent on capitalists for survival and expropriating the wealth
they've stolen from us. Let's talk about that more.

[Whether we like it or not, for the foreseeable [future]{.mark} at
least, [responses to climate change]{.mark} [will be]{.mark}
[developed]{.mark} [in]{.mark} a context of global
[capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. What does this imply in political and
strategie terms and how can we make sense of this theoretically? In this
chapter we try to nuance eco-Marxist claims which might result from this
more or less banal, if perhaps depressing, observation about
capitalism\'s hold over climate politics. [There is now a substantial
and rapidly growing such literature on climate politics, which has
increasingly focused on the commodification of climate change, through
the establishment of markets in emissions allowances or credits, and
which is, reasonably enough, highly critical of such commodification
processes]{.underline} (prudham 2009; Castree 2003; Lohmann 2005). Tbere
are also a number of analyses rehearsing well-known ,second
contradiction of capitalism\' (O\'Conoor 1994; Kove1l2002; Benton 2000
Sandler 1994) or ,treadmill ofproduction\' arguments (Roberts et al
2003; Gould et al 2008) in relation to climate change - suggesting !hat
[capitalism\' s growth-addiction and fossil fuel dependence means !hat
it cannot possibly decarbonise]{.underline}. We seek here to nuance the
depressing conclusions !hat can be drawn from such analyses and ask
under what conditions might we be able to imagine capitalism
decarbonising?

Our starting point for such an analysis is the observation that judged
by the number of initiatives and levels of finance now being committed,
many capitalists and state elites, for a range of different reasons, now
have a political and financial stake in the project of decarbonisation.
To be sure, there is a whole swathe of greenwash to wade through, but it
is nevertheless the case !hat a tangible constituency of ,climate
capitalists\' with a material interest in decarbonisation exists. Tbey
may currently be relatively marginal to business-as-usual models of
capitalism, but it is worth posing the question about whether and under
what conditions a carbon economy might develop into a project of climate
capitalism in which growth is achieved through low carbon development.

[[Projects]{.mark} 10 decarbooise capitalism don\'t of course emerge
from a void. They rather [start from a particular moment in time with
its attendant structural features]{.mark}. [Climate]{.mark}
[politics]{.mark} [reflects]{.mark} both the [structural]{.mark}
[features of capitalism]{.mark} in general [and the legacy of
neo-liberalism]{.mark} in particular because it is as a result of these
structores]{.underline}, [institutions and practices that responses to
climate change have started to emerge.]{.underline} It is also the case,
however, that the imperative of addressing c\\imate change and moving
towards low carbon development paths require new forms of capitaIism.
What this means politically is thst strategies and actions 10 tackle
c\\imate change have 10 gain traction with social forces and actors thst
wield significant power within contemporary forms of capitalism. That
this will be a contradictory, messy, and problematic process is obvious;
but our working contention here is that we ought 10 take seriously thst
it might not be impossible.

In this chapter we look first at some of the principal characteristics
and featores of capitalism in general and of neo-liberaIism in
particular !hat are pertinent 10, and structore the opportunities for,
action on c\\imate change. Second, we look at the ways in which some
ways of tackling c\\imate change have won out, been ,natoralised\' and
come to be seen as more effective and legitimate ways of responding 10
the issue than others. We do this through two short case studies of
emissions trading and carbon offset markets. Third and fina\\ly we
explore ways in which we might understand these dynamics theoretically.

Perhaps more than any other environmental issue, c\\imate change appears
10 place in stark reliefthe limits of capitalism\'s ability 10 deal with
the environmental problems that it generates. Whereas new markets and
products could relativeIy quickly and easily be created for alternatives
10 ozone-depleting chemicals such as CFCs, and technological fixes were
available to address acid rain, the centra\\ity of energy use based on
widespread use of fossil foels means action on c\\imate change
potentially disrupts capitalism\'s ability, indeed necessity, 10 grow.
Hence while strategies of ecological moderuisation demonstrate the
ability of capitalism to deliver growth without increased emissions,
through innovative use of technology and realising efficiency gains,
tackling c\\imate change means producing and consuming less of the very
sources of energy !hat have foelled the industrial revolution,
colouialism and post-war economic growth. It is for this reason !hat
many have suggested !hat addressing c\\imate change and continuing with
capitalism are mutua\\ly exc\\usive: you cannot have both (Kovell 2002).
Much of this claim is based on the centrality of fossil foels, and
especially the properties of oil, 10 capitalism (Altvater 2006: 39-41).
Whether c\\imate change reflects a ,crisis of the capitalist mode of
production\' as Brunnengräber (2006: 219) claims, is a moot point.

At the very least, though, [[thinking about climate change in a
capitalist context entails]{.mark} a project of broad
[socio-techno-political transformation]{.mark}. [Capita1ism]{.mark} as
usual [cannot]{.mark} [deliver]{.mark} the scale of [change]{.mark}
required [to]{.mark} tackle [climate change]{.mark} and hence needs to
transform itself once again]{.underline}. But of course capitalism has
engendered such transformations before, albeit perhaps on a different
scale and not always by intentional design. Popular reference points for
the nature of the transformation required might include the industrial
revolution (and a need for a second industrial revolution), a new green
deal (modelIed on the Marshali Plan or the Bretton Woods institutions in
terms ofscale ofrequired fInance as weil as the need for new global
governance institutions) or widespread socio-technical transitions such
as the development and roll-out ofthe railways duriog the 19th century
(NeweIl and Paterson 2010). The point to note here is that fossil fuel
capitalism is just one form, albeit an entrenched and enduriog one, of
capita1ism. While certain ,base tecbnologies\' (Storper and Walker 1989)
may characterise eras of capitalism, as Buck notes, it is important not
to ,confuse particular manifestations of capitalism- that is, particular
historical social formations- with capitalism itself, thus
under-estimating the flexibility of the beast\' (2006: 60). Even a
postoil economy, he argues, would be a capita1ist one as long as there
is an industrial reserve army without ownership or contml of the means
of production and as long as the production of commodities by
commodities prevails. Hence, even peak oil can be re-worked as an
opportunity for growth where fossil fuels can be replaced by a ,solar
revolution\' (Altvater 2006: 53). As Marx and Engels famously stated,
the bourgeoisie ,cannot exist without constantiy revolutionizing the
means ofproduction\' (1978: 28). Tecbnological dynamism is at the heart
of capitalism, and as a consequence, its tecbnological trajectories are
not necessarlIy set in stone. Capital, as value in motion, does not care
about what it makes, the machinery used or the motive souree. It cares
only about its own self-expansion and valorisation (Buck 2006: 63).
These are the incessant waves of creative destruction that need to be
harnessed towards the goal of a low carbon economy.

[[Responses to climate change are]{.mark} most immediately [structured
by the key features of neo-liberalism]{.mark},]{.underline} and we
suggest here that four, in particular, are crucial. [There are few
surprises here. First is the dominance of pro-market ideology, the
[rhetoric that markets are the most ,natural\' sort of social
organization]{.mark}]{.underline} (Gamble 1988; Frank 2000). In the
context of ciimate change and environmental debates more generaily, this
has led to an ideological undermining of direct regulatory (so-called
,command and control\') approaches in favour either of fIscai
instruments like carbon taxes or, even better for market purists,
emissions trading systerus where private property rights in
environmental services are established. That !bis has favoured the
dominanee of market-based approaches, notably emissions trading and
carbon offset markets !hat we elaborate io More detail below, is fairly
obvious. As we have argued elsewhere:

Had c1imate change become seen as an acute problem in 1950 rather than
from the Iate 19808 onwards, anyone proposing emissions trading as the
principal means to des! with it would have been subjec! to ridicule \...
The rise of the carboo economy, as one manifestation of a broader trend
towards thc ,markctisation\' of cnvironmental govemance, evolves
alongside and is a product of the entrenchment of neo-liberal politics
througbou! the 1990s (Newell and Patersoo 2009: 77).

But market ideology has not been suffieient. A second key feature of
neo-liberalism is the struetural importanee of finanee withio
neo-liberalism. Many talk of a ,finanee-Ied regime of aceurnulation\' as
the distinctive eeonomie dynamie of neo-liberalism (Boyer 2000; Aglietta
1999), and the dominanee of finanee io the eontemporary eeonomy is
widely reeognised (Helleioer 1994; Leyshon and Thrift 1997). But there
is a broad consensus aeross a range ofperspectives that what was
distinetive about the period from around 1980 was the re-birth of a
global finanee !hat gaioed both extreme mobility and thus eapacity to
diseipline states, but also enhanced power over other fraetions of
eapital, notably manufacturing (Cox 1994). lbis heightened power
offinanee is important in understanding the popularity of earbon
markets, sioce finaneiers are the primary benefieiary of!bis partieular
poliey design. 2 But it also helps undersland other features of climate
governanee - notably the emergenee of investor networks Iike the Carbon
Disclosure Projeet (CDP) !hat attempt to improve information flows about
firms\' exposure to climate change impacts and their earbon-iotensity
and thus vu!nerability to emissions reductions polieies

lbird are the soaring inequalities provoked by neo-liberal forms of
eeODomie management. Withio eountries, such ioequalities have sharpened
almost everywhere sinee the early 1980s, through eombinations of
ioereased unemployment, welf are retrenehment, and more unequally
distributed lax burdens. GlobalIy, they have sharpened beeause of
monetary policies fixated on the use of interest rates, the shift io
value-added from manufaeturing to financial services, substitution of
key resourees of developing eountry exports, and the Iike. Such
inequalities have both been the basis for the highly eonflietual
eharacter of global elimate negotiations sinee their ioeeption io 1991
(Roberts and Park 2007), but also generated opportunities fOT the
exploitation and eommodifieation of the basis of that eonfliet. The
emergenee of the Clean Development Meehanism (CDM) io the Kyoto Protocol
can be ioterpreted from this poiot ofview precisely as the iostitutional
means by which to forge a compromise between the two broad groups of
states with differentiated responsibility for addressiog the issue but
uneven opportunities to da so. It enabled a de-politicisation ofthe
resolution of the North-South conflict by redistributing the ,burden\'
of emissions reductions from North to South through a market mechanism
which could be presented as apolitical, and even beneficial to certaio
Southem actors. As we will see below, adding ,sustainable development\'
as a criteria which emissions reductions projects paid for by the global
North had to meet, was supposed to be a way of ensuriog development
benefits flowed from makiog cheaper emissions reductions available to
richer countries.

Fioally, neo-liberal economies are often understood (if rhetorically,
even ideologically) as about fast-moviog networks replacing old
bureaucratic (state and corporate) hierarchies. [In the [climate change
context]{.mark}, it is possible to find all sorts of examples of this
sort of organisational arrangement. It can variously be [seen]{.mark}:
[in the shift to ,governance\', voluntary agreements and
partnerships]{.mark} between states and corporations; io the swathe of
private sector governaoce initiatives]{.underline}, such as the CDP
already mentioned, the various certification standards that attempt to
govem the voluntary carbon market, or the adoption of climate chaoge
measures by corporations under the rubric of Corporate Social
Responsibility (Bulkeley and Newell 2010). It can even be observed io
the character of social movernent mobilisiog by groups such as Plane
Stupid or the Climate Justice movernent to promote radical climate
action and to resist carbon markets.

[So [the pursuit of ,climate capitalism\']{.mark} [is]{.mark} strongly
[shaped by the neo-liberal eontext]{.mark} io which it emerged, with all
its problems and eontradictions]{.underline}. A number of features of
this carbon economy result. First, the role of the state io relation to
elimate chaoge has been configured around facilitating and enabliog a
series of possibilities for commodifieation and accumulation fOT various
parts of capital, in particular for financiers and closely associated
sectors (auditors, lawyers, especially). International iostitutions such
as the World Bank have also been closely iovolved io promoting this sort
of carbon economy - with the Prototype Carbon Fund and a number of other
Bank facilities being established to promote investment io the CDM and,
more recently, to deliver carbon finance in the form of the Climate
Investment Funds CYV orld Bank 2008).

Second, finance has been given a long leash io ioventing a ,carbon
economy\' out ofthe specific policy iostruments. We, therefore, do not
only have primary tradiog io the allowances and credits created by
partieular schemes like the EU ETS or the CDM, but we also have
increasingly elaborate derivative instruments (although as yel nowhere
near as complex as asset-backed securities, for example), with futures
and options markets enabling regulated firms to hedge against price
volatility as other finns do in other financial markets (airlines
hedging oil price volatility, for example, or farmers and agribusiness
hedging grain price volatility). We also have an elaborate set of
secondary commodification processes - auditors selling services to
verify claims made in CDM project documents, insurers such as Munich Re
providing services to insure against a CDM project not being approved,
and so on. Finally, there are other financial instruments emerging, only
tangentially connected to climate bot perhaps stimulated by the enhanced
sensitivity to weather/climate questions, such as weather derivatives
enabling various institutions (most famously, pubs and restaurants) to
hedge against adverse weather (Pryke 2007; Pollard et al 2008).

[[Third, this sort of response to climate change entails various
exploitative processes endemic to capitalism and intensified under
neo-liberalism]{.underline}]{.mark}. Bumpus and Liverman (2008) have
borrowed from Harvey (2005) in coining the term ,accumulation by
decarbonisation\' to capture this process. While decarbonisation is more
commonly referred to as the process of taking the carbon out of the
global economy, they use it to refer to processes of taking other
people\'s carbon (rights) away from thern, a slightly more precise term
than the ,carbon colonialism\' prevalent in critiques of carbon markets
(Bachram 2004, Lohmann 2006). Two specific processes are involved.
First, in international negotiations, unequal rights to emit are being
written into legal documents like the Kyoto Protocol, and these rights
then turned into commodities. So rich countrles are gaining assets in
the process, assels !hat are not available to poorer countrles. Second,
in the CDM in particular, bot also in the voluntary carbon markets, this
entails a process whereby the rich are able to invest in developing
countrles to offset their emissions, in practice therefore taking away
future possible emissions rights !hat people in those countrles ought to
have.

#### Creating technologies to solve permafrost or methane release further entrenches us into the capitalist system

**Wallenberg '10** \[Erik; April 22; PhD candidate in History at CUNY
Graduate Center; SocialistWorker.Org; "Capitalism is not sustainable";
https://socialistworker.org/2010/04/22/capitalism-is-not-sustainable\] 

Foster argues that \"[[the split between natural-physical science and
social science\...has been one of the main alienated intellectual
products of bourgeois society]{.underline}]{.mark}.\" By contrast, he
says:

The ultimate strength of Marxist analysis has never resided chiefly in
its economic crisis theory, nor even in its analysis of class struggle
as such, but lies much deeper in its materialist conception of history,
both human and natural\--understood, as this only truly can be, as a
dialectical and endlessly contingent process.

Foster\'s book does just this, combining the best in scientific thought
with the necessary understanding of the social system we live under and
its connection to our natural history.

He begins by laying out in broad strokes [[the havoc humanity is
imparting on the planet]{.underline}]{.mark}, and thus our future.
Global climate change isn\'t the whole story, but rather one of the
largest and all-encompassing challenges we face\--from the contamination
of water and destruction of fisheries to nutrient degradation of the
soil and extinction of species.

That said, Foster addresses the latest findings in climate science. For
instance, [with arctic temperatures rising, new sources of
climate-changing [gases are entering the atmosphere]{.mark}. The
[release of methane]{.mark} from the warming [and melting of the
permafrost]{.mark} in Arctic regions [will speed up]{.mark} the process
of global warming, as the temperatures rise and engage in a positive
feedback cycle,]{.underline} with no clear end in sight.

Daily, we get further confirmation of this process\--for example, the
journal Science reported last month that methane releases from the
Arctic soils under the Siberian Sea are at higher levels than previously
thought.

From the opening pages in which [[Foster]{.underline}]{.mark} argues
that technology will be helpful in solving our environmental crisis, he
also [[argues that technology alone can do no such thing. Instead, we
need a transformative social approach to the climate
crisis]{.mark}.]{.underline}

He [[argues against]{.underline}]{.mark} those who would say
[[capitalism can be \"greened]{.underline}]{.mark}\": \"[Aside from
technology, virtually [nothing in]{.mark} the social organization of
[society will change in this vision]{.mark}. [The commitment to
unlimited accumulation of capital and to an order that places]{.mark}
artificially generated [private wants over individual and social needs
is unaltered]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"

[[In order to begin developing new technology that isn\'t driven by the
market and the profit motive]{.mark}, but rather by the need to create a
sustainable world, [**people must first be freed by a social
revolution** that can harness humanity\'s potential for just such a
task]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Climate models created inevitably reflect capitalist ideals and priorities

**Deeb '22** \[Jamiel; October 31; socialist teacher and environmental
activist; RedFlag.org; "The politics behind climate models";
https://redflag.org.au/article/politics-behind-climate-models\]

Frequently, the **[[science simply does not translate into the necessary
government policy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In 2015, 195
[[governments]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Paris Climate Accord committed
to limit global warming to 1.5 to 2°C. In response, the IPCC was tasked
with achieving the impossible: to determine policy options to limit
warming to under 2°C while justifying the continuation of the
fossil-fuelled economy. To do this, the IPCC [[use]{.underline}]{.mark}s
computer [[models called integrated assessment
models]{.underline}]{.mark} (IAMs) [that]{.mark} [[couple earth system
models with economic models]{.underline}.]{.mark}

IAMs are recognised as the defining measure of government policy's
impact on the climate. But [[the]{.mark} [model]{.mark}ling[s goal is
not to generate policy that minimises capitalism's impact on the
planet.]{.mark} Instead, the IPCC's fifth assessment report states that
[the aim is to produce policy options that "**minimiz\[e\] aggregate
economic costs**"]{.mark}]{.underline}, while assuming "functioning
markets and competitive market behavior". In other words, [[while the
models are constrained by climate ambitions, they prioritise the
protection of fossil fuel assets over everything
else]{.mark}.]{.underline}

As a result, "[The way IAMs are set up, **[mitigating climate change is
always more expensive than inaction]{.mark}**"]{.underline}, explain the
authors of a 2018 Climate Analytics report. [IAMs [justify the economic
viability of inaction]{.mark} with far-fetched hypothetical scenarios
that discount many of the negative impacts of climate
change,]{.underline} such as its toll on people, the economy and the
biosphere. [And]{.mark} [they [weigh near-term economic costs more
heavily than future costs]{.mark}, assuming that technological progress
will compensate.]{.underline}

[By ignoring climate change's impact on the economy]{.mark}, for
example, IAMs don't factor in a global economy struggling to adapt
infrastructure to withstand an increasingly hostile climate.

By ignoring climate change's impact on [[human
wellbeing]{.underline}]{.mark}, IAMs don't factor in the tremendous
suffering associated with inaction. The IPCC estimates that by 2030, at
1.5°C, up to 700 million Africans alone could be displaced due to water
stress. The international economy will struggle to respond to the
escalating humanitarian crises caused by a 1.5°C rise.

By ignoring climate change's impact on [[energy
demand]{.underline}]{.mark}, IAMs don't factor in the rising demand for
electricity (still partially fuelled by hydrocarbons) as the need for
air conditioning skyrockets. In 2018, the International Energy Agency
estimated that with 2°C of warming, additional energy demand could be
equivalent to the current electricity consumption of the US, Europe and
Japan combined.

Because IAMs are structured to favour inaction and the protection of
existing industries, governments require a degree of creative accounting
to make it seem like their policies could achieve meaningful climate
targets. One important example is the concept of carbon offsets. Carbon
offsets involve governments factoring into their policy modelling
hypothetical technology that may one day remove carbon from the
atmosphere, even if such technology doesn't yet exist. An example of
this carbon offsetting technology is Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and
Storage (BECCS).

[[Almost all modelled policy options rest on large-scale employment of
BECCS that]{.underline}]{.mark}, based on current technology, [[would be
impossible to implement]{.mark}. [The end result is to grossly
underestimate the warming that should be
expected]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} For example, in a 2°C pathway
outlined in the Global Warming of 1.5°C report, to compensate for no
rapid transition, the model requires a carbon drawdown of 12 gigatonnes
of CO2 per year by 2100, which is equivalent to about a third of 2021
global emissions.

#### Understanding capitalism and combatting it is a prerequisite to solving climate change 

**Irish Marxist Review '19** \[Irish Marxist Review; November; journal
in association with the Socialist Workers Party; John Molyneux Archive;
"Apocalypse Now! Climate change, capitalism and revolution"; Vol. 8 No.
25; pp. 5--13;
https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/writers/molyneux/2019/11/apocalypse.htm\] 

In this article I will take for granted that '[[we']{.underline}]{.mark}
-- concerned citizens, activists, trade unionists, workers, young people
and old, [[school students]{.underline}]{.mark} and college students --
all of us together, [[should do everything]{.underline}]{.mark} we can
[[to raise awareness about climate change and to build a movement
against it]{.underline}]{.mark}. We have supported the 20 September
school strike and will support future strikes; we will back Extinction
Rebellion Week and every other similar resistance round the world. We
will also back every piece of progressive legislation -- like bans on
fracking, declarations of climate emergencies or People Before Profit
TD, Bríd Smith's Climate Emergency Measures Bill (which seeks to compel
the Irish Government to cease grant licences for further fossil-fuel
exploration and extraction). \[15\] We will fight for everything that
gains us time, moves us in the right direction and pushes back the
impending disaster or even sets an example to the rest of the world as
to what has to be done. The only exception to this is those measures
such as carbon taxes which violate the principle of just transition and,
by penalising working class people, threaten to alienate them from the
mass popular movement we need. We should campaign for free and expanded
public transport; for retrofitting of homes; for huge afforestation
programmes; for the redirection of agriculture away from cattle and beef
production and for massive public investment in renewable energy (e.g.
wind, solar and tidal power).

Having said all that, however, I also want to argue that in order to
combat climate change, to prevent it becoming catastrophic and to deal
with the effects of it that are already built into the system and will
inevitably intensify in the coming years, [[it is **essential** for the
anti-climate change movement to become anti-capitalist and indeed **to
end capitalism.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

**[[Capitalism drives and is linked to climate change at every
level.]{.underline}]{.mark}** There is an important historical argument
that our economic dependence on fossil fuels came about not due to the
availability of natural resources nor for technological reasons but
because it suited the needs of capitalism. Andreas Malm in his important
study Fossil Capital: The Rise of Steam Power and the Roots of Global
Warming \[16\] has shown that during the Industrial Revolution steam
power based on coal was adopted in preference to waterpower because it
facilitated capitalist exploitation. There is also the powerful
argument, both scientific and political, that the origins of a new
geological age, the Anthropocene, characterised by a total environmental
crisis including climate change, corresponds to the immense global
capitalist boom after the Second World War. \[17\] Hence the 'hockey
stick' shaped graphs for so many natural and social phenomena ranging
from C02 in the atmosphere to ocean acidification, urban population and
international tourism. \[18\]

However, the angle from which I want to approach this issue is the
simple question: [[why have]{.underline}]{.mark} our rulers, [[the
world's governments]{.underline}]{.mark} and politicians [[left it so
long to even begin seriously addressing the issue of climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark} when it would have been so much easier to
tackle it earlier? Here there are a number of parallels. What would
happen to a doctor whose patient was diagnosed with cancer and who
knowingly ignored the diagnosis, fobbing the patient off with
paracetamol, until they were almost at death's door? They would
certainly be struck off and probably subject to criminal prosecution. Or
what about a shipping company that had an ocean liner which they knew
was not seaworthy and most likely would not make the Atlantic crossing
for which it was scheduled, but nonetheless gambled on sending it out at
the cost of two thousand lives? That company would be guilty at the
least of corporate manslaughter. These examples can be repeated for
cars, planes, bridges and so on. Yet the fact is that what our rulers
have done regarding climate change has been worse than any of these in
terms of its consequences for humanity and animal species. [[They have,
already, guaranteed the death of millions of people and the extinction
of thousands of species.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Let's be clear about how long they have known about the problem. [[The
possibility of the greenhouse effect was first understood in
1896]{.underline}]{.mark}, by the Swedish scientist, Svante Arhenhuis,
but it was not considered practically significant. The fact that some
[[global warming was]{.underline}]{.mark} actually occurring was [[first
measured in the 1930s]{.underline}]{.mark}, but it was assumed to be on
too minute a scale to worry about. This started to change in the 1950s
with the work of Guy Stewart Callender and [in the 1960s]{.underline}
David Keeling [demonstrated that human-generated greenhouse emissions
were large enough to cause global warming]{.underline}. \[19\] By the
[late 1970s there was already a degree of scientific consensus on
this.]{.underline} The simple fact that the UN Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change (IPCC) was established in 1988 by the World
Meteorological Organisation and the UN Environment Programme, and issued
its first report in 1990, testifies to the fact that every serious
government and political leader has known about the problem for at least
thirty years. In 1992 the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC), at the Rio Earth Summit, committed states to reduce gas
emissions 'based on the then scientific consensus'. Scientific evidence
from Greenland ice cores meant by the [end of the 1990s scientists
knew]{.underline} they were looking not just at gradual warming but the
[real possibility of rapid and catastrophic warming should certain
thresholds or tipping points be crossed]{.underline}. \[20\] In other
words, [[our so-called 'world leaders' and governments,]{.mark} almost
without exception[, have been knowingly gambling with the lives of
hundreds of millions of people for
decades]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Their deep guilt is undeniable,
but the question is why?

One answer might be that [[these politicians simply don't give a
damn]{.mark} -- they care only about themselves, their careers and the
pockets they can line.]{.underline} But even if this were true it
wouldn't explain why politicians and governments would not consider it
in their own interest, politically as well as for their children, to do
something serious about climate change in the same way that the British
ruling class decided it was in their interest to abolish the slave trade
in 1833 or the US government decided it had to abolish slavery in order
to win the Civil War or, a century later, to pass civil rights
legislation.

An answer to that might be that there have been no votes in tackling
climate change because 'people' didn't care about it. But people didn't
care because they didn't understand it. This, of course, can be laid at
the door of the media. The responsibility of the media is clear. For
decades they colluded with corporate funded climate denial to treat
climate change as just 'a theory' and invariably to 'balance' scientific
testimony with climate scepticism. If they no longer do that (in Ireland
and the UK, as opposed to the US and elsewhere) they still don't treat
climate change as a real 'crisis', like Brexit or an economic crash, but
relegate it to the inside pages, and they still refuse to link
ever-increasing extreme weather events to climate change. However, the
media is not a stand-alone independent force in this: a) the media is
largely owned and controlled by people, like Rupert Murdoch and Denis
O'Brien, who are an integral part of the ruling elites; b) the media,
especially the news media, takes its cue to a huge extent from
governments and leading politicians. All it would have required to get
the media to change their agenda would have been a few concerted
statements and appeals from 'world leaders'. So, we are back to our
question as to why those leaders have refused to do this.

The compelling answer is that [[tackling climate change consistently
clashed with the interests and priorities of capitalism, the imperative
of profit]{.underline}]{.mark}. [At every stage, and still today, [our
leaders have found that even when they "sincerely" wanted to do what was
necessary to avert climate breakdown this conflicted with the immediate
needs of 'the economy' i.e. capitalism and they invariably chose the
latter over the former]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} This applied
whether it was Enda Kenny, George Bush, Bill Clinton or Barack Obama
(never mind Donald Trump), Tony Blair, David Cameron, Nicolas Sarkozy ,
Emmanuel Macron, Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping.

**[[Understanding this involves understanding not so much how climate
change works as how capitalism works]{.mark}.]{.underline}** \[21\] For
capitalist businesses [[the profit imperative is not just a need for a
reasonable 'return']{.mark}]{.underline} (as they often claim) [[but a
drive to maximise profit]{.underline}]{.mark}. Nor is it just a matter
of personal greed, an insatiable desire for more luxury cars, yachts or
private jets. It is an objective pressure deriving from the very nature
of the capitalist system -- not just the ideology of neoliberalism --
which dominates every enterprise and unit within it. This is because
[capitalism is based on competition in the market,]{.underline}
ultimately the world market, and [the measure of success in that
competition is the amount of profit realised]{.underline}. This operates
at every level from the local corner shop to the giant multinational
corporation. To put it concretely SPAR is competing with Centra,
Volkswagen is competing with Toyota and General Motors, and ExxonMobile
is competing with BP and Shell, and if they do not keep up in the race,
the race for profit, they will go out of business and get taken over.
Crucially -- for responding to climate change -- this operates not just
at the level of states but also internationally between capitalist
states, between the USA and China; Russia and the EU; Brazil and India
and so on in an endless struggle of all against all.

At a national level this relentless competition is partially mitigated
by the existence of the state (not just parliament but the civil
service, judiciary, police, armed forces etc.). One of the functions of
the capitalist state, along with repression, is to provide services and
infrastructure (schools, hospitals, roads, transport etc.) required by
the capitalist economy as a whole, which it may not be in the interests
of private businesses to maintain. But no such overarching authority
exists at the international level. \[22\] Internationally each
capitalist state acts on behalf of its own capitalist class in the
global competition. Thus, not only each business but also each state is
under an iron compulsion to grow its economy at a rate that matches its
rivals.

The final piece in this capitalist jigsaw is the central role played by
fossil-fuel and fossil fuel related corporations in the global
capitalist economy. The likes of Shell, BP, ExxonMobile, Texaco, Toyota,
Volkswagen and General Motors are among the biggest in the world and
they all exercise a huge influence on government. It should be
remembered that US Vice President Dick Cheney, the brains behind George
W, Bush, was an executive of the oil company, Halliburton and that
Trump's first Secretary of State was Rex Tillerson, former CEO of
ExxonMobile. But it should also be understood that the objective weight
of these companies in the world economy gives them immense political
leverage even without such direct personal influence.

[As a result of these combined pressures the prioritisation of profit
over the environment and over human life becomes second nature to both
business executives and mainstream politicians and state officials. **US
Secretary of State**,]{.underline} Mike Pompeo[, **is pleased the Arctic
is melting**. In May this year, with dollar-signs flashing in his eyes,
he stated:]{.underline}

'[The Arctic is at the forefront of opportunity and
abundance]{.underline}. It houses 13 percent of the world's undiscovered
oil, 30 percent of its undiscovered gas, an abundance of uranium, rare
earth minerals, gold, diamonds, and millions of square miles of untapped
resources and fisheries galore. Steady reductions in sea ice are opening
new passageways and new opportunities for trade. This could potentially
slash the time it takes to travel between Asia and the West by as much
as 20 days. Arctic sea lanes could become the 21st century Suez and
Panama Canals. \[23\]

The point here is not how outrageous but how normal this is. 'They'
might not all say it so openly, but i**[t is how the large majority of
them think]{.underline}**. [It requires immense popular
mobilisation]{.underline}, on a much greater scale than anything yet
achieved by Extinction Rebellion or Fridays For Future or anybody else
[to force them to even contemplate any other way of
operating]{.underline} and when that does happen their 'change of heart'
is only temporary, to get the threat of the popular movement to go away
before returning to profit-driven business-as-usual.

[This is why capitalism and pro-capitalist politicians have done next to
nothing to stop climate change;]{.underline} this is why they have been
prepared to sacrifice millions of lives and millions of species and
gamble with the future of the planet. \[23a\] [That is what they have
done for decades and, in many cases, for centuries, what they are still
doing now and will continue to do in the future]{.underline}. And this
doesn't just mean they're not doing enough; it means they are actively
intervening to prevent serious action being taken, just as Leo Varadkar
and Fine Gael did in Ireland by using behind-the-scenes parliamentary
manoeuvres to block Brid Smith's Climate Emergency Measures Bill, and as
Obama did at the Copenhagen Earth Summit in 2009 and Trump has done by
pulling the US out of the 2015 Paris Accords. [Trump's statement on this
summed it all up in a single sentence: 'The Paris Accord will undermine
our economy'.]{.underline}

This explanation of **[what has already happened]{.underline}** in the

and most unlikely miracle, substantial sections of the global business

#### Necessary changes during global problems will never be made by profit-incentivized, capitalist leaders - Covid was a warning shot

[[The COVID-19 pandemic is a sampling of what is to
come]{.underline}]{.mark} in a time of unbounded environmental
degradation. Public health crises of this scale, combined with mass
displacement of people from areas that are susceptible to extreme
weather events, will become the norm.

We need a dramatic and rapid transition away from fossil fuels. The
reopening of the economy presents an opportunity to lay the basis for
this transformation by putting millions of unemployed workers back to
work, rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure on a green basis. Instead,
big business and corporate politicians have put their full weight behind
reopening economies before it is safe for workers, and with no regard
for their environmental impact. [[As long as profit is the bottom
line]{.underline}]{.mark}, the type of [[fundamental **changes** that
will be necessary to avoid a full environmental and public health
meltdown **cannot happen.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

Worst Hurricane Season and Hottest Summer Yet

The Australian mega-fires that kicked off 2020 were a massive warning of
the dangers of increasing global temperatures. Permafrost is melting
faster than predicted, threatening to release huge quantities of carbon
dioxide and methane, an even more dangerous gas, into the atmosphere.
One hundred fifty million people live in areas that will be below the
high tide line by 2050, and many more live in coastal areas that will be
decimated by increasingly frequent and severe hurricanes. 

Deadly viruses like COVID-19 often appear in areas where humans are
dramatically changing ecosystems through expansion of agriculture,
manufacturing, etc. While many species are displaced from this
development, bats are highly adaptable and often remain. They are the
original hosts of six major epidemics in the last 26 years. Scientists
think the COVID-19 virus spread from a bat to another animal in the wild
that was then brought to a wet market in Wuhan, China. Animals are kept
in packed cages and with their immune systems weakened from the stress,
viruses can easily spread between species, including humans. Animal
agriculture practices globally pose serious threats to public health,
and are the leading cause of deforestation, ocean contamination, and
soil erosion. 

[[If lockdowns had been implemented weeks earlier in the U.S., tens of
thousands of people would not have died]{.underline}]{.mark}. Scientists
have been warning about the likelihood of a pandemic for years. While
the criminal incompetence of Trump played a critical role[, [the
dramatically under-resourced disaster response agencies and a for-profit
health care system made Americans particularly
susceptible]{.mark}]{.underline} to COVID-19.

How did we get here?

[[The global ruling class have made trillions of dollars from the
extraction of fossil fuels, development of luxury properties,
construction of military equipment, and mass production of unnecessary
goods from unsustainable materials]{.underline}]{.mark}. They exert
enormous control over political systems everywhere. [[Politicians and
lawmakers cater to their needs by slashing environmental regulations,
providing completely toothless oversight, and attacking workers' rights
in order to prevent organizing against hazardous work and environmental
degradation.]{.mark} ]{.underline}

This profit-driven approach is apparent in the chronic and criminal
mismanagement of critical utility infrastructure. The owners of the
Sanford and Edenville dams that breached in central Michigan in May,
leading to the evacuation of tens of thousands, had been cited by
federal regulators for safety issues since 2004. The 2019 California
wildfires that destroyed 14,000 homes and killed 85 people started when
a live wire broke free of a tower that was a quarter century past what
PG&E, the state's largest utility company, considered its "useful
life." 

Our Infrastructure is Crumbling: We Need a Green New Deal

Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. government has spent
a whopping \$2.2 trillion in three stimulus bills. \$500 billion was
granted in loans to major industries, \$58 billion of which was in
grants and loans to the airline industry, and tens of billions to the
Department of Defense and Homeland Security. The U.S. military produces
more greenhouse gas emissions than 140 countries combined.

[[The problem is not a lack of resources. It's who is in charge of
them.]{.underline}]{.mark}

It is democratic socialists like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie
Sanders alongside a powerful movement of young people who have helped to
popularize the idea of a Green New Deal in the U.S. We urgently need to
fight for this massive program that would create millions of union jobs
that would directly address historic levels of unemployment and tackle
climate change. 

Jobs could be created to fix and retrofit green infrastructure,
including a massive expansion of public transit and high quality,
public, affordable housing; rapidly develop renewable energy sources;
rewild and reforest ecosystems; develop and expand urban green space;
massively invest in and scale up organic farming; and build
infrastructure to mitigate the worst effects of natural disasters. We
also need to massively increase jobs in health care and first response
(such as wildfire containment teams).

This is where trillions of stimulus dollars should go, not to bailing
out corporations that got us here in the first place. 

**[[System Change not Climate Change]{.underline}]{.mark}**

The fight for these fundamental changes will be met with tremendous
opposition from powerful corporate interests and the political
establishment. While some gains can be made under the pressure of a mass
movement, they will not happen quickly enough given the short timeline
we have to dramatically cut emissions and prevent irreversible climate
change. 

The economy needs to be run in the interests of the vast majority of
people. To achieve this, we need democratic public ownership of the
major polluters, including fossil fuel, utility, and major agricultural
companies under the control of a workers government. Democratically
elected councils of workers and consumers would make decisions about how
industries are run on the basis of what is needed, efficient, and
sustainable. These councils could rapidly, and immediately begin
transitioning polluting industries towards 100% renewable energy and
environmentally sustainable practices.

Because of the global nature of the capitalist economy and the climate
crisis itself, [[we]{.underline}]{.mark} would eventually [[need
international, socialist]{.mark},]{.underline} democratic [[planning to
achieve a fully environmentally sustainable future.]{.underline}]{.mark}

We can draw important lessons from the #JusticeforGeorgeFloyd movement
on how to fight for real change. It is a grassroots, multiracial
movement taking to the streets that has forced convictions of killer
cops and reductions in police budgets. Democrats and Republicans alike
have ruled over police brutality and an impending climate catastrophe
for decades and have done little to nothing given the scale of these
crises. We need to move beyond these thoroughly corporate parties and
build our own political voice for working people. We need an independent
left political party representing the interests of the multiracial
working class and youth to take on and take over polluting industries. 

**[[We cannot afford to wait]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The political
establishment will see to it that we pay for the triple crises of the
pandemic, economic depression, and climate meltdown even with our lives.
[[The system of capitalism is sick, and the global working class is
getting sicker. COVID-19 is a warning sign]{.underline}]{.mark} of the
massive public health crisis, inextricably linked with environmental
degradation, that is to come. But a healthier, safer, more equitable
world is possible: if we're willing to fight for it.

**Vernyk '25** \[Oleg; May; Writer at the International Socialist
League, Member of the International Executive Committee of the CWI;
Theoretical and Political Journal of the International Socialist League,
"The IMPERIALIST ALLIANCE between Trump and Putin," no. 8\] lucao

Of course, Donald [Trump wants to go down in **history**]{.underline}.
For a politician in the twilight of his life, this is a fairly
reasonable desire.

All that remains is to choose the optimal means of achieving that goal.
And it seems [**[Trump]{.mark}** has already [made his
choice]{.mark}]{.underline}\...

[[To **plunge** the world into]{.mark} a state of total [chaos]{.mark}
and destroy everything that has constituted]{.underline} the foundations
of [the global **world order**]{.underline} for many decades since the
end of World War II.

Naturally, that past world order was far from ideal or just. It was
based on the [[rules of **global capitalist**
globalization]{.underline}]{.mark}, in which [Western
**imperialism**]{.underline} as a whole (the so-called "axis of good")
[**[concealed]{.mark}** its [economic interests behind]{.mark} the
[**liberal veil** of]{.mark}]{.underline} "[defending **[human
rights]{.mark}**]{.underline}" [and]{.underline} the "[struggle for
**democracy**]{.underline}." Expansionist foreign policy under the
liberal doctrine required the U.S. to make significant investments to
bribe governments and influential politicians across the world.

This, in turn, encouraged the [[outsourcing]{.underline}]{.mark} of
major segments of [economic **[production]{.mark}** and capital from
the]{.underline} "**[golden billion]{.underline}**" [countries [to
developing nations]{.mark} with corrupt]{.underline} bureaucratic
[regimes]{.underline}, tax havens [[facilitating **tax
evasion**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and **cheap
labor**]{.underline}]{.mark} that drastically reduced production costs.
Products manufactured abroad were then deliberately directed to the U.S.
market, generating huge profits for the same American owners of
transnational corporations, while simultaneously driving up the U.S.
trade deficit---which, as of January 2025, had already reached \$130
billion. As of March 24, 2025, the U.S. national debt stood at \$36.64
trillion, which amounts to approximately \$107,000 per U.S. citizen.

Maintaining a global clientele has clearly become an extremely costly
affair for the U.S. The massive structure of the United States Agency
for International Development (**[USAID]{.underline}**), under the
liberal sponsorship of the Democratic Party, [had become largely
**self-sustaining**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} it was [increasingly
difficult to determine whether it]{.underline} truly [**executed** U.S.
interests]{.underline} or simply "managed" (read: looted) the U.S.
budget.

For years, USAID's work in Ukraine was based on those same principles of
bribery and corruption targeting senior officials and politicians, as
well as the creation of U.S.-funded "civil society" organizations.
During Trump's first term, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tried
to balance the interests of both Trump's Republicans and Biden's
Democrats. He even initiated several criminal investigations into the
Ukrainian company Burisma, where Hunter Biden---Joe Biden's son---had
worked. It's clear that employment was directly tied to his family
connections and the opportunities that came with them.

However, after Joe Biden's electoral victory in November 2020, Zelensky
was forced to change his stance, quickly shutting down all criminal
cases related to Burisma and Hunter Biden. Since then, the Ukrainian
president has remained under the tight grip of the liberal-globalist
bloc led by the U.S. Democratic Party--- something Trump is well aware
of and which has directly influenced his attitude toward Zelensky and,
consequently, the Russia-Ukraine war.

In any case, we are already witnessing how Trump's declared trade war
has caused massive collapses across almost every major global stock
market. Strong predictions are already being made that this chaos spells
the end of the "American century." The U.S. is abandoning not only its
role as the defender of liberal values but also its leadership as the
central economy of the socalled "free market."

The "**[free market]{.underline}**" [was always]{.underline} a
**[fictitious]{.underline}** category, far removed from the real
economic and trade relations of the imperialist era.
[[Protectionism]{.underline}]{.mark}, quotas, [and]{.underline}
restrictive [tariffs have always accompanied]{.underline} global trade,
and "**[free market]{.underline}**" rhetoric [merely
**[concealed]{.mark}** the economic [interests of]{.mark}]{.underline}
the [[main **global players**]{.underline}]{.mark}. But it seems Trump
has grown tired of this hypocritical disguise. He has already announced
a potential U.S. withdrawal from the World Trade Organization (WTO) and
recently blocked the appointment of new judges to its adjudicatory
bodies, effectively paralyzing the WTO's ability to issue rulings.
Furthermore, in March 2025, the U.S. suspended its financial
contributions for both 2024 and 2025.

THE PREMISES OF AN IMPERIALIST PACT BETWEEN THE U.S. AND RUSSIA

Today, analysts are racking their brains trying to explain why
[[Trump]{.mark} has [**pivoted** toward Putin]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
New York Times---the flagship outlet of the liberal U.S.
bourgeoisie---recently published: "Trump's Pivot Toward Putin's Russia
Upends Generations of U.S. Policy."

Among the quoted reasons is Trump's intention to weaken Western Europe,
now a competitor to U.S. imperialism. Politico quoted a European
diplomat who said, "We now have an alliance between a Russian president
who wants to destroy Europe and an American president who also wants to
destroy Europe." Indeed, [**Trump** has [dismantled]{.mark} the very
[idea of]{.mark}]{.underline} "[[**transatlantic**
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}" in mere months, effectively dissolving
the NATO imperialist bloc.

Also at play is Trump's desire to break the solid military and economic
alliance between the emerging imperialisms of China and Russia. He has
announced a 125% tariff hike on Chinese imports, while Russia and its
satellite Belarus were conspicuously excluded from the list of affected
countries. The administration's explanation---that those countries
"don't trade with the U.S."---reeks more of cynicism than naivety. Even
uninhabited islands full of penguins have been sanctioned.

While war-torn Ukraine, victim of Russian imperialist aggression, has
been slapped with a 10% tariff, its aggressor faces none. It's easy to
predict that [this [**zero-tariff** policy]{.mark} will [attract foreign
investment into]{.mark} the **[Russia]{.mark}**n]{.underline} and
Belarusian [economies]{.underline}, [ruled by the **authoritarian**
regimes of Putin]{.underline} and Lukashenko. [**Trump** expects this
**unprecedented** gesture will be well received by
**Putin**]{.underline} and provoke a rupture in the economic, political,
and military ties between Russia and China---the real target of Trump's
sanctions.

BACKGROUND OF THE IMPERIALIST PACT BETWEEN THE U.S. AND RUSSIA

We've already pointed out that the [[**collaboration** between U.S. and
Russian **imperialisms**]{.underline}]{.mark}--- that is, the close
alignment between Trump and Putin---[[had]{.mark} an [immediate
effect]{.mark} in]{.underline} the **[rapprochement]{.underline}**
between the U.S. and Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko. Trump's
team announced that a new "agreement" will soon be signed, through which
economic and personal sanctions against Belarus and Lukashenko will be
lifted in exchange for the latter granting amnesty to certain political
prisoners.

In this global context, few were surprised when the U.S. withdrew from
the group tasked with investigating Russian war crimes in Ukraine. The
New York Times, citing its own sources, stated that this decision is a
sign that the Trump administration is walking away from Biden's
commitment to personally hold Putin accountable for crimes committed
against Ukrainians.

Another [key aspect of this **imperialist pact** is Trump's view of the
**world order**]{.underline} established at the 1945 Yalta agreements,
which he [sees as **disadvantageous** to U.S. imperialism]{.underline}.
Trump views those agreements as shackles that prevented the U.S. from
outpacing its competitors---shackles he believes the U.S. must now break
free from in order to maintain global hegemony.

[[Putin's]{.mark} armed **[aggression]{.mark}**]{.underline} against
Ukraine [[gave Trump a]{.mark} perfect [example]{.mark}]{.underline} of
how [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} openly [[disregard
**i**]{.mark}nternational **[law]{.mark}**]{.underline} and its basic
principles, [such as the **inviolability** of borders]{.underline} and
the condemnation of wars of conquest. This is why
[[legitimizing]{.underline}]{.mark} Putin's actions and rehabilitating
him as an acceptable political figure in the West has become a key
strategic goal of Trump's foreign policy. This would also serve to
justify and legitimize [[future **imperialist
aggressions**]{.underline}]{.mark} by the U.S. [[against any]{.mark}
**country** or **[people]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[that stand in its
way]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[**Trump** is]{.mark} stripping U.S. **imperialism**]{.underline} of
all its masks of "defending democracy and human rights,"
[[reverting]{.mark} it [to]{.mark} its [**original**
form]{.mark}]{.underline}[---]{.mark}the "law of the jungle" [[of
**savage capitalism**]{.underline}]{.mark}. This [aggressive imperialism
no longer needs]{.underline} "**[allies]{.underline}**" or "partners."
His threats of [territorial **annexation** against NATO]{.underline}
members such as Denmark and Canada [**confirm** this]{.underline}. The
only exception appears to be Israel, considered an imperialist enclave
in the Middle East and a tool for pressuring Arab regimes that produce
oil and gas.

[**Trump** [feels]{.mark}]{.underline} deep respect---and even
**[[envy]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[[for **Putin**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[Hi[**s** authoritarian]{.mark}]{.underline}, anti-democratic
[personality]{.underline} [already clashes with the **democratic
[principles]{.mark}** of the]{.underline} U.S. [**bourgeois**
constitution]{.underline}, such as the ban on serving more than two
presidential terms. Since his re-election, [**Trump** has [hinted
at]{.mark}]{.underline} the possibility of running for a **[[third
term]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Putin's five authoritarian terms are a
"pink dream" for him---a model he would like to imitate, even if he's
still bound by the trappings of a democracy he's ready to toss into the
"dustbin of history."

A CONSPIRACY BEHIND UKRAINE'S BACK: THE REINCARNATION OF THE MUNICH
AGREEMENTS\[1\]

Let's recall the timeline of recent events. On February 12, 2025, U.S.
President Donald [**[Trump]{.mark}** posted]{.underline} on Truth Social
about a [[phone call with]{.underline}]{.mark} Russian President
Vladimir **[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This post literally [rocked
global media]{.underline} and hit like a bombshell in the international
community. Trump claimed he had a "long and productive phone call with
Putin" and [[expressed a desire for U.S.-Russia cooperation to
benefit]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[both
countries]{.underline}]{.mark}**." With this, the U.S. and Russia agreed
to begin negotiations to end the war in Ukraine--- without even
informing Ukraine of the start of these separatist negotiations between
imperialist powers, carried out behind its back.

\<\<\<Condensed, None Omitted\>\>\>

Interestingly, in the later negotiations in Saudi Arabia---structured as
a U.S.-Russia format---participants included U.S. Secretary of State
Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, National Security Advisor Mike
Waltz, and Special Envoy for the Middle East Steve Witkoff. Clearly,
Trump tailored the delegation to meet all of Putin's demands. At Putin's
request, Trump excluded from the delegation Keith Kellogg, the U.S.
President's Special Representative for Ukraine, who until recently had
still publicly referenced Ukraine's interests. Ukrainian President
Volodymyr Zelensky waited until the last moment for a "Trump peace plan"
to be presented at the Munich Security Conference, which he attended.
However, Trump and Putin ignored not only Zelensky but also the
so-called "European partners of the U.S.," who traditionally insisted on
being part of any negotiations to end the war between Russia and
Ukraine. On February 15, 2025, during his speech at the Munich Security
Conference, Zelensky flatly rejected Trump's policy of holding separate
negotiations with Russia, suggesting Trump had betrayed Ukraine's
interests. In his address, Zelensky appealed to the major European Union
countries for military and financial support, realizing he could no
longer count on the Trump administration. But it's clear that the EU's
joint military assistance to Ukraine will be very limited and cannot
match in scale or potential what the U.S. used to provide---assistance
that now appears to have ended. At present, it's important to note that
this mythical "Trump peace plan" has yet to be officially announced or
made public. But its broad strokes are already evident to all. In an
effort to appease Putin, Trump has completely excluded from the current
negotiations any mention of the Ukrainian territories occupied by Russia
between 2014 and 2022 (Crimea and parts of Donbas), and a ceasefire and
freeze of the conflict along the current front line is on the table.
Simultaneously, most U.S. economic and personal sanctions against Russia
would be lifted. This option clearly satisfies Putin, as Russia is in a
weakened position due to Ukraine's heroic resistance and the lack of
significant advances on the front. Trump and his team repeatedly point
to Zelensky's highly corrupt regime, his low approval ratings, and the
fact that Ukraine must finally hold presidential and parliamentary
elections. One of the Trump team's most serious threats against Zelensky
was the possibility of a full financial audit of U.S. military aid to
Ukraine. Journalist Tucker Carlson, a close Trump ally, even openly
accused Zelensky of allowing U.S.-supplied weapons to end up in the
hands of Mexican drug cartels. Carlson presented no evidence, but
apparently none was needed---these accusations were primarily meant to
exert total control over Zelensky ahead of the Trump-Putin "deal."
Realizing the weakness of his position, Volodymyr Zelensky offered Trump
exclusive rights for U.S. development of Ukraine's rare earth minerals.
Zelensky hoped Trump, as a businessman, would be drawn to the proposal
and continue supplying weapons to Ukraine. But he fell into Trump's
trap. Trump happily accepted the offer---not to continue weapons
shipments, but as a pretext to demand repayment for weapons already
delivered. Naturally, when Zelensky realized his mistake, he tried to
reverse the "deal" or at least obtain some promise of future U.S.
support from Trump. However, it's worth remembering that---even though
Zelensky has erased political opponents from the public
sphere---Ukrainian society reacted very negatively to the idea of
selling off the country's natural resources to the Americans. According
to Ukraine's Constitution, its natural resources belong to the Ukrainian
people, and President Zelensky has no right to dispose of them
unilaterally. The scandal on February 28, 2025, in the Oval Office
between Zelensky and Trump made it clear to the world that Trump
couldn't care less about "security guarantees for Ukraine." But he is
deeply interested in the colonial exploitation of Ukraine's rare earth
minerals. The subsequent suspension of arms shipments and intelligence
sharing from the U.S. left Zelensky literally on his knees before Donald
Trump. The U.S. then drafted and proposed an even more predatory
agreement on rare earth minerals that hands total control of Ukraine's
extractive sector to the U.S. It must also be noted that Trump's
promises to quickly end the war are now running up against Putin's
diplomatic games, as the Russian leader delays peace negotiations while
preparing for a broader offensive. It is unlikely Trump will impose new
sanctions on Russia, even if this stalling becomes obvious to him. But
on the other hand, the Russian economy is already plunging into
recession, and the chaotic trade wars launched by Trump have already
triggered a drop in oil prices---on which Russia depends to sustain its
long-term war effort. SOCIALIST POLITICS AS A WAY OUT OF GLOBAL TURMOIL

\<\<\<Paragraph Breaks Resume\>\>\>

It's increasingly evident that [**Trump**'s frantic and largely chaotic
[attempts to reshape]{.mark} the internal structure and]{.underline}
pecking order of [[**global imperialism** only accelerate its **systemic
crisis**]{.mark} and highlight its utter **inability** to solve the
problems]{.underline} of global order.

The [[**camaraderie** among imperialists only
revives]{.underline}]{.mark}, in the collective consciousness of
humanity, the [terrible [**specters** of the]{.mark} two **[world
wars]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the past. And the heroic resistance of
Ukraine to Russian imperialism---along with its betrayal by the
U.S.---once again makes clear that [[**oppressed** peoples must never
tie their fate to]{.mark} one [**imperialist** camp]{.mark} against
another]{.underline}. The imperialist predators may fight or reconcile.
But they always do so behind the backs of workers in their own countries
and the peoples they oppress.

The liberal varnish on Trump's imperialism has been fully discarded as
unnecessary. [[The **liberal bourgeoisie**]{.underline}]{.mark}---though
not yet completely defeated---[[has suffered a crushing
blow]{.underline}]{.mark} at the hands [[of the **far
right**]{.underline}]{.mark}, from which it's unlikely to recover

In the past three decades, 'illegal, unreported and unregulated'
(**[[IUU]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [fishing [has been branded

(Chapsos and Hamilton 2019; IUU Fishing Action Alliance Pledge 2023;

**societal impacts**]{.underline} and operational synergies with other
forms of criminal activities (de Coning and Witbooi 2015; Belhabib and
Le Billon 2022). The United Nations (UN), in particular the Food and
Agriculture [[Organisation]{.underline}]{.mark} (FAO), have been
instrumental in the configuration of a so-called 'global fight against
IUU fishing' (FAO 2023, 32), [[hosting **high-level**]{.mark} policy
[forums]{.mark} allegedly [aimed at '**combating**]{.mark} **IUU**
fishing']{.underline} (FAO 2023, 29) and protecting the global marine
'commons' (FAO 2016a). IUU fishing is now [[part of]{.mark} the
**dominant** development agenda]{.underline} (e.g., Sustainable
Development Goals \[**[[SDGs]{.underline}]{.mark}**\], Target 14.4 on
sustainable fishing and 14.6 on fisheries subsidies1), as well as
international agreements and domestic legal reforms (e.g., Agreement on
Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate IUU Fishing). Also,
since 2010, the European Union (EU), has used an anti-IUU fishing
carding system, which imposes market measures to influence the fisheries
regulations and governance of countries exporting fish to the EU,
focusing on environmental sustainability (Kadfak et al. 2023; Kadfak and
Linke 2021). In this essay, we contend that the fight against IUU
fishing is not doing what it allegedly was set to do, especially in
relation to halting rampant fish overexploitation and safeguarding
oceans. [**[States]{.mark}** around the globe [are increasingly relying
on **market-based** and **punitive**
approaches]{.mark}]{.underline}---administrative and criminal
sanctions---[[to control]{.mark} and regulate fishing
practices]{.underline}. [This [coincides with]{.mark}]{.underline} a
[[**scaling-up** of military]{.mark} law [enforcement and
**privatisation** of oceans]{.mark}]{.underline}, yet, as we show, what
enforced, who is targeted, where and how, is predominantly mediated by
uneven capitalist social relations and historically entrenched power
structures. We argue that [[**punitive** approaches]{.mark} are
[disproportionately **target**]{.mark}ing **fisher peoples** and
precarious fish **[workers]{.mark}**]{.underline},2 [[rather
than]{.underline}]{.mark} elite [**[corporate]{.mark}**
actors]{.underline}, including business owners, financiers and traders
responsible for funding, sustaining and accelerating overexploitation.3
Moreover, [if the goal is to 'save' the oceans]{.underline}, then, [why
are the [**state-led** agencies]{.mark}]{.underline}, international
nongovernmental organisations and international bodies supposedly
committed to the fight against IUU fishing [also promoting and
[**capitalising** from]{.mark} the [harmful **expansion** of]{.mark} the
[ocean economy]{.mark}]{.underline}? (Brent et al. 2020; Mallin and
Barbesgaard 2020). This begs questioning saving what, for whom, and how.

\<\<\<Condensed, None Omitted\>\>\>

In this essay, we contribute to the growing literature exploring the
biases of IUU fishing governance. We show how corporations navigate
global and national IUU fishing policy frames with impunity, while
labour issues at sea and across the seafood supply chain are frequently
bypassed and excluded from IUU fishing policies and enforcement
\[Thailand as an exception\] (see Alonso and Marschke 2023; Kadfak and
Linke 2021; Kadfak and Linke 2021; Vandergeest and Marschke 2021). Our
analysis expands existing work, showing how the criminalisation of
fisher peoples and the exploitative labour relations in the fishing
industry are deeply connected and embedded to the expansion of
capitalist accumulation. To develop the argument, we draw on the
governance of IUU fishing in Colombia, anchoring our critique into two
acts that expose a theatre of enforcement at sea.4 First, is the act of
criminalisation, which centres on the spectacles of military enforcement
and the criminalisation of fisher peoples.5 Second, is the act of
impunity, which focuses on the labour struggles within the sector,
including the labour abuses of industrial tuna fish workers on land, in
processing factories, and at sea, working on large commercial fishing
vessels. Also, examining who are the 'grabbers' benefitting from this
impunity. We understand grabbers as the individuals and companies who
use policies, laws and practices to privatise and take control or gain
access over ocean spaces and commons, displacing fisher peoples and
communities (Franco et al. 2014). Here, we pay attention to industrial
fishing and seafood processing companies. We assert that the fight
against IUU fishing emerges in part as a fight against fisher peoples
and precarious fish workers, not grabbers, instigating a new wave of
ocean grabbing and criminalisation of already marginalised groups, with
differentiated impacts at the intersections of class, gender and race.
The criminalisation of fisher peoples and fish workers requires further
scrutiny to unpack the processes that enable foreign and domestic
capitalist elites to operate under high levels of impunity (e.g.,
Sumaila et al. 2017; Belhabib and Le Billon 2022). We divide Colombia\'s
fisheries into three main domains: nearshore, where fisher peoples come
under harsh anti-IUU fishing regulations for the state to bolster its
sovereignty and sustainability claims (see Roszko 2017, on how fishers
are used by states to defend national sovereignty in the South China
Sea); offshore, where industrial fishing companies registered in tax
haven jurisdictions rework state sovereignties and law enforcement, and
the absence thereof, exploiting oceans and fish workers to the advantage
of their beneficial owners and political backers (as also shown by
Alonso and Marschke 2023; Marschke and Vandergeest 2023; Vandergeest and
Marschke 2021); and onshore, where fisher peoples and fish workers are
sanctioned. Moreover, fish workers processing industrial catches are
subjected to labour exploitation to boost corporate profits. These
domains are porous and interconnected, for instance, industrial fishing
vessels often operate illegally in nearshore waters reserved for
artisanal fisheries with relatively high impunity. Importantly, fisher
peoples have historically played a key role defending their marine
commons from grabbers (e.g., Figueroa et al. 2024; Satizábal et al.
2024). This is now further threatened by biased enforcement from
authorities. In connecting the criminalisation of fisher peoples and the
labour exploitation of fish workers, we stress the political need to
build solidarity across movements of fisher peoples and fish workers, as
well as with the movements of other precarious workers and food
producers to stregthen and collectivise the struggle against
criminalisation, labour exploitation and the destruction of customary
commons. 2 Setting the Stage: Common Oceans and IUU Fishing

\<\<\<Paragraph Breaks Resume\>\>\>

**[[IUU]{.underline}]{.mark}** fishing is frequently [used as an
**all-inclusive** expert-driven term that [divides fishing practices
in]{.mark} **[ahistorical]{.mark}**]{.underline} and normative
[[binaries]{.underline}]{.mark}: legal/illegal, reported/unreported and
regulated/unregulated (Song et al. 2020). These [binaries are
**ambiguous**]{.underline} [and [elude issues of
**power**]{.mark}]{.underline} and scale (Okafor-Yarwood et al. 2022),
as much as the intricacies of cross-sectoral and land--ocean relations.
For instance, illegal fishing is often defined as failing to comply with
the fisheries regulation (i.e., breaking the law), including fishing
without a permit (FAO 2016b). However, most fisher peoples around the
globe operate without permits and are under-reported, partly because of
their historical exclusion from national reporting systems and the
institutional weakness and underfunding of fishing authorities
(Saavedra-Díaz and Jentoft 2017; Song et al. 2020). Moreover, a lack of
government rules does not mean an absence of place-based customary laws,
tenure and governance arrangements (Mbatha 2022; Wilson 2021). The
assumption is that more sanctions and punishment are needed, which
positions widely criticised top-down approaches to the rule of law as
integral to 'saving' the marine commons from reckless and rampant
exploitation (see, e.g., Mora et al. 2009). Although international
arenas and discussions on IUU fishing remain focused on
capital-intensive industrial fisheries and their forms of organised
crime, at national levels, reforms are predominately targeting fisher
peoples and precarious fish workers via intensifying militarisation and
criminalisation (Noriega Narváez 2023; Okafor-Yarwood et al. 2022; Song
et al. 2020).6

Importantly, [[commons]{.mark} are not **homogenous** and fixed in
space]{.underline}; [they are [produced]{.mark}]{.underline}, lived and
shaped [[by]{.mark} everyday interactions and [capitalist
**relations**]{.mark}]{.underline} (García-López et al. 2021; Harvey
2011). Commons are contradictory; the myth of the 'tragedy of the
commons' has perversely relied on the idea of commons as open access and
in need of state intervention and privatisation (Harvey 2011;
Mildenberger 2019). As Harvey (2011) explains, commons [involve
processes of **enclosure**]{.underline}, which are [used by political
[elites]{.mark} to [impose **rules** that]{.mark} end up
[turn]{.mark}ing certain places and [entities into
**capital**]{.mark}]{.underline} (i.e., natural resources) to be
commodified. Indeed, the [[configuration of **IUU fishing** as a
threat]{.mark} to the global marine commons [is **weaponised**]{.mark}
by state and industry actors [to create fear and
claim]{.mark}]{.underline} authority/[**[property]{.mark}**
over]{.underline} certain **[marine]{.underline}**
places/entities/peoples (see FAO (2018) on 'the fight to save our
oceans'). As Song et al. (2020, 837) point out, the governance of IUU
fishing works to reconfigure small-scale/artisanal/traditional fisheries
as illegal and ungovernable.

3 The Act of Criminalisation

In 2020, on the Caribbean coast of Colombia, the [**police** shared on
social media an image of a **Black woman** standing in front of a police
wall banner]{.underline}, flanked by two armed officers. She appears to
be handcuffed and looking at the ground where the image reveals the top
of a plastic bucket. The image caption states, 'woman captured
transporting nine blue crabs, an endangered species protected by the
authorities ... the woman is now with the Office of the Attorney General
and will have to respond to the alleged crime of use of renewable
natural resources'.7 This [image reveals the [**problematic policing**
and use of **social media**]{.mark} by armed forces to [show off]{.mark}
their **[authority]{.mark}** and actions [in the]{.mark} protections of
the]{.underline} Atlantic and Pacific **[[oceans]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Similar images have been shared by the same and other armed forces in
the country, especially after Law 1851 in 2017 established new measures
against the crime of illegal fishing and illicit fishing activity in
Colombia. [**Press releases** often link military actions to the defence
of the environment and **state sovereignty**]{.underline}. The images
used show alleged criminals surrounded by armed guards while
dramatically displaying the seized illegal catches like trophies
organised in rows (Figure 1). The banner used by the National Army
repeats the following message: 'protegemos el azul de la bandera' (we
protect the blue from the flag). This is no surprise, since the
mid-1980s the armed forces and news media in Colombia have produced and
shared similar media representations in relation to the failed 'war on
drugs', enforced by the very same agencies. This also happens in a
context of centralised fisheries management regulations, which are often
unknown to fisher peoples and created without the participation of
artisanal fisheries representatives (Jiménez and Saavedra-Díaz 2019).
However, in relation to the press release of the woman and the bucket of
blue crabs, social media users responded outraged; some comments
included 'the police should be ashamed!', 'the injustices of justice'
and 'maybe she was hungry and has a family to feed, why are they
treating her like a criminal, I hope \[...\] those crabs don\'t go to
waste'. Our writing in this symposium piece ripples from this outrage
and our shared concern with the rapid [[increase]{.mark} in
administrative and **criminal [sanctions]{.mark}** [that are
**disproportionately** targeting fisher]{.mark} peoples]{.underline} and
precarious fish workers, rather than transforming industrial
exploitative relations.

3.1 Uneven Criminalisation of Onshore and Nearshore Artisanal Fisheries
The governance of IUU fishing in Colombia has grown rapidly since the
mid-1970s, with a rise from at least 21 types of offences resulting in 8
types of administrative sanctions at the national level in 19748 to 96
types of offences and 57 administrative and criminal sanctions in 2024
(see Appendix 1 for summary of key national regulations). This reveals a
rapid increase in the number of sanctioned behaviours, as well as the
types and severity of administrative and criminal sanctions. Existing
regulations have largely omitted distinctions between industrial and
artisanal fisheries (only excluding subsistence fishing for IUU fishing
regulations), marine or inland fisheries, or between social classes
(e.g., in relation to monthly income, types of labour and size of
vessel/catch). From its inception until today, the severity of sanctions
is determined by the legislator in their assessment of the severity of
the damage. However, the processes to conduct this assessment for
industrial or artisanal fisheries, or in relation to the division and
allocation of sanctions among vessel captains, shipowners and fishing
permit holders, or in relation to the actors involved in fisheries
supply chains remains unspecified. In the 1970s, fish were governed as
hydrobiological resources, a subgroup of natural resources, with
sanctioned behaviours subjected to administrative sanctions from the
natural resources\' authority. This shifted during the 1980s, when the
Penal Code (Decree 100, 1980) introduced the illicit use, harm and
border violation for the exploitation of natural resources as sanctioned
behaviours, subjected to economic (fines) and criminal sanctions
(imprisonment). In the 1990s, the National Fisheries Policy (Law 13,
1990) increased the number of sanctioned behaviours and the severity of
administrative sanctions. It also framed fish as renewable natural
resources, divided into hydrobiological resources, with species
subjected to environmental protection by the environmental authority,
and fishing resources, with species as opened for exploitation and
subjected to fisheries quotas or bans, and governed by the fisheries
authority. Later, in 2000, the reform to the Penal Code (Law 599, 2000)
introduced the crime of illegal fishing in relation to fishing in a
prohibited area, with explosives, poisonous substances or drying bodies
of water. Illegal fishing was subjected to fines from 10 to
50,000 monthly minimum wage (MMW) and 12 to 36 months of imprisonment
for the illegal fishing of fishing resources---note that in 2014, 78.5%
of fishers earned less than the MMW (FAO 2015, 22--23). Fines and
periods of imprisonment for the illicit use of hydrobiological resources
was prolonged, to up to 10,000 MMW (increasing from up to 300 MMW as
defined by Law 99, 1993) and to a range of 24--60 months of imprisonment
(from 6 to 36 months as established by Decree 100, 1980; see Appendix
1). In 2017, the 'Policy to prevent, deter, and eradicate illegal
fishing and the crime of illicit fishing activity' (hereon the Illegal
Fishing Policy) was established by Law 1851 despite the political
opposition and resistance of artisanal fisheries representatives
throughout its political debate and their exclusion from the lawmaking
process. An activist from Fundación Alma stated at a public hearing
discussing the Illegal Fishing Policy at the Senate, 'we don\'t need a
law like this, a kind of policing code, badly made on a desk'.9 In
framing the Illegal Fishing Policy as a policing code, this and other
activists highlighted that the law was created without representatives
from artisanal fisheries, increasing the risks of criminalisation and
further socio-economic exclusion of a historically marginalised group.10
The Illegal Fishing Policy led to the creation of the National Board on
Illegal and Illicit Fishing Activities (Mesa Nacional de Pesca Ilegal e
Ilícita actividad de Pesca), an inter-institutional board for
coordinating the implementation of the law. The board is responsible for
articulating the cooperation among national fisheries, environmental and
enforcement agencies, excluding human rights and labour related
agencies, as well as representatives from the fisheries sector (Noriega
Narváez 2023).11 In responding to the demands from artisanal fisheries
representatives and supporting activists, only a 2-year period in which
artisanal fishers could not be sanctioned was established, but the
National Authority for Aquaculture and Fisheries (AUNAP) committed to
finalising the formalisation of artisanal fishers. Seven years later,
the formalisation process has not been completed. Indeed, the
formalisation of artisanal fisheries has been discussed in Colombia
since the 1990s for the creation of a special regime of social security
for artisanal fishers as established by Law 13, which has not been
created (Article 62). Moreover, to date, there is no census of fisheries
in the country, which should have been completed by AUNAP in 2024 (as
established by Law 2268, 2022; see Defensoría del Pueblo 2024). By 2024,
AUNAP reported the formalisation of a total of 126,963 artisanal fishers
(AUNAP 2024a, 2024b, 131). Some rough estimates from the Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Development projected that in 2011, there were at
least 423,135 fishers (including industrial fish workers and artisanal
fishers) with 350,000 involved in artisanal fisheries (FAO 2015, 23).
Although these outdated estimates are likely to underestimate the total
number of artisanal fishers, they would suggest that about 36% of
artisanal fishers had fishing licences by 2024, compared to 2% in 2014.
The Illegal Fishing Policy excludes subsistence fishing, but offers no
distinction between marine and inland fisheries, or industrial and
artisanal fisheries, only specifying that industrial and artisanal
vessels with foreign flags will be subjected to higher fines.12 Thus,
despite licensing efforts, the Illegal Fishing Policy threatens the
legality of most artisanal fishers in the country, also failing to
specify the process to determine the severity of the sanctions and the
allocation of criminal liability. Formalisation in this context is
contradictory, reducing the vulnerability of fisher peoples to be
sanctioned for not having a licence, while also making fisher peoples
more easily identifiable and sanctioned. In 2021, Decree 281 lobbied by
environmental non-governmental organisations (NGOs) turned sharks and
rays into hydrobiological resources, thereby banning their capture, even
to artisanal fishing communities that have traditionally used shark and
ray bycatch in their local diets. A year later, the Colombian
Constitutional Court (C-148/2022) banned recreational fishing under the
premise that fish are animals and as such are sentient subjects, which
should be treated with dignity and not as objects. Both measures have
been widely criticised for undermining coastal food security and the
dignity of fishing ways of life. Particularly, considering that
recreational fishing has primarily employed artisanal fishers (including
Black and Indigenous fishers) and small businesses with access to engine
vessels hired by domestic and foreign tourists using hand-lines to catch
large pelagic/freshwater fish species in inland and nearshore waters. In
relation to the ban on recreational fisheries, the former Mayor of Bahía
Solano (north Pacific Coast) stated that 'the mistreatment of fish is
not part of recreational fishing, but of industrial fisheries with
licences in Colombia, where fish are caught indiscriminately'
(Castellanos-Galindo et al. 2021; Chocó7días 2022; Torres Tovar 2023).
Colombia is also the first country around the globe to meet the goal of
declaring 30% of the national marine territory as a protected area (in
2022). The process to achieve this involved a political push to rapidly
increase state control over marine customary commons (leading to
unprecedented philanthropic support, including from the US\$10 Billion
Bezos Earth Fund commitment for the 2020s). In early 2022, former
right-wing president, Iván Duque, declared the expansion of the
problematic 'Artemisa Operation' to oceans, which aimed to 'fight'
environmental destruction via militarisation, but has been criticised
and framed as a new phase of the 'war against peasantry' in Colombia
(Bautista 2022). This military operation was halted in September 2022 by
the former Minister of Environment and Sustainable Development, Susana
Muhamad, from the left-wing government of Gustavo Petro, who highlighted
the need to transform the approach to work with communities and focus on
large capital funding environmental destruction (Osorio and Díaz 2022).
As Alonso and Marschke (2023) highlight in relation to the 'blue boats'
in Vietnam, artisanal fisheries are an easier target for law enforcement
as they are smaller and slower, and fish onshore and nearshore, thus
reducing enforcement fuel costs, time, interinstitutional coordination
efforts, and the risks faced by enforcement agents in comparison with
industrial fleets operating further offshore. In Colombia, the rapid
increase in the number of fishing behaviours sanctioned unevenly impacts
artisanal fishers, particularly those fishing, processing, trading and
transporting fish in proximity to marine protected areas and ports,
where law enforcement intensifies. Many artisanal fishers continue their
traditional ways of life in fear of sanctions and persecution, with
uneven impacts at the intersection of class, race and gender. The lack
of transparency in relation to the application of sanctions, together
with the limited training legislators receive in relation to fisheries
management, means that artisanal fishers charged with minor offences are
also at risk of high administrative, criminal and/or economic sanctions.
For artisanal fisher peoples in lower socio-economic groups,
administrative sanctions including the seizure of catches or
confiscation of fishing gears or vessels may disproportionately impact
their lives, families and communities, facing higher risk of losing
local control over their livelihoods. Noriega Narváez (2023) identified
collective and individual human rights violations to artisanal fishers
associated with the governance of IUU fishing in Colombia. This includes
violations to the right to a dignified life, food, work, social
security, territory, healthy environment and cultural identity, thus
demonstrating that artisanal fisheries should not be subjected to biased
and human rights--infringing IUU fishing policies and law enforcement. 4
The Act of Impunity 4.1 Nearshore Impunity On 26 August 2022, 'Taurus
I', a large tuna purse seiner (78 m) built in the United States, with a
Venezuelan flag and registered to operate in Bahía Solano to service the
Colombian company Mar Atún Ltda., was recorded by artisanal fishers
fishing inside the Special Fisheries Management Zone (ZEMP from 2.5
nautical miles \[nm\] to 22.5 nm from the coastline, Resolution
2724/2017), where there is a ban on industrial fishing (Semana 2022).
This zone was initially declared in 2013 (from 2.5 to 12 nm and expanded
in 2017) as part of the struggle and resistance of Black fishing
communities, who have been mobilising for more than 25 years to ban the
fishing industry and defend their territory (Díaz Merlano et al. 2024).
Artisanal fishers have repeatedly accused foreign and national
industrial tuna vessels that continue to fish in this area; however,
their complaints are often ignored by coastal law enforcement
authorities under the premise that there are not enough resources to
cover for the costs of enforcement or that there is not enough evidence
to advance sanctioning processes (e.g., Liga Contra el Silencio 2022;
Satizábal and Batterbury 2018). On this occasion, the video shared by
artisanal fishers on social media revealed a pod of dolphins trapped in
the nets of the tuna vessel with some individuals with snorkels trying
to release them (see Noticias Caracol 2022). It also showed a GPS
monitor indicating the specific geographic location of the event
(21.92 nm from the coastline) and an image of Taurus I and its
helicopter parked on a landing deck. This video went viral causing
national outrage over the safety of the dolphins. Just a few hours
later, the authorities requested Taurus I to return to port in
Buenaventura for investigation. In dubious circumstances, Taurus I ended
up catching fire and sinking before arriving at port (Figure 2; see CNC
Chocó 2022). The fishing crew of 29 (14 Venezuelan, 5 Mexican, 5
Colombian, 2 Ecuadorian, 2 Peruvian,and 1 Costa Rican nationals) were
rescued by the Colombian National Army (Armada de Colombia 2022).

Colombia. Source:

Taurus I had a fishing licence from AUNAP. Despite the video shared by
artisanal fishers, the Maritime Authority (DIMAR) claimed that the
vessel was not fishing inside the ZEMP.13 However, on the 29th of
August, the Minister of Environment and Sustainable Development gave a
press release noting that Taurus I was fishing outside its permit
area---at 22 nm with a fishing permit from 30 nm (Redacción Ambiente
2022). To date, there is no resolution in relation to the investigation
of the incident or the sanctioning process for fishing in a restricted
area and other 13 possible infractions, including in relation to fishing
crew certifications and the maintenance of the vessel and fishing gears
(Quintero Díaz 2024). There is also a legal dispute in relation to who
is the maritime agent responsible for the management of Taurus I (DIMAR
2024). This episode reveals the struggles of fishers as law enforcement
is shaped by financial and political will. The act of impunity also
jeopardises community empowerment and customary governance, threatening
the territorial rights of Black communities who have been historically
fighting to protect and recover their marine commons from industrial
overexploitation and environmental destruction. 4.2 Onshore Impunity We
now turn to tuna processing factories and tuna companies to reveal what
is excluded from the governance of IUU fishing. In the Public Audience
on Companies and Human Rights (2023), a Black woman activist
representing the Women\'s Movement Board (Mesa del Movimiento de
Mujeres) in Cartagena and Bolívar, which is part of the National Union
of Food Industry Workers (SINALTRAINAL), denounced human rights
violations from Seatech International Inc. (owners of Van Camp\'s), one
of the four main tuna industry companies in Colombia. She explained that
this has been a long-term struggle of more than 11 years, as most
workers are subcontracted (approximately 1700 workers, 83% women, only
100 directly contracted) and are subjected to anti-union violence, human
rights abuses and gender violence including sexual harassment, labour
and psychological abuses. This includes working long hours under salary
reductions for taking a break. As she noted, workers\' salaries undergo
reduction penalties for taking breaks, many are using diapers to avoid
going to the toilet, this also constrains their access to nursing and
caring breaks. A group of workers (mainly women) self-organised against
these abuses and were fired. She claimed that 'we are fighting a big
monster, we have been threatened, their violence is not only
subcontracting to weaken the union movement, violating rights ... it is
violence against women and the environment ... these companies have the
police on their side, they are the owners and are also part of the
ex-government'.14 The Fundación Manos Muertas (Dead Hands Foundation)
was created in 2009 in response to mass dismissals of tuna and shrimp
women workers in Cartagena. Workers in processing factories are
subjected to repetitive movements, intense and prolonged work shifts
(14--18 hours), many of whom end up developing musculoskeletal diseases
(including carpal tunnel syndrome) (Torres-Tovar 2020). Fundación Manos
Muertas has more than 300 members; together with the Food Industry
Workers\' Union (USTRIAL), they have mobilised legal actions,
complaints, rallies in defence of the rights and reparation of sick
workers. Union members have legally and publicly denounced their
experiences of repression, policing, harassment, massive layoffs,
threats and legal persecution (see, e.g., Volcánicas 2023). One of the
companies is being investigated by the Ministry of Labour. Importantly,
ports and industrial fish workers have also been impacted by neoliberal
and anti-union policies since the 1990s, which pave the way for the
privatisation of ports and precarisation of labour in a context of high
violence against union activists (Pereira de Barros 2018).15 In 2012,
the Inspector of the International Transport Workers\' Federation (ITF)
in Colombia wrote a letter to the Minister of Labour stating that
Seatech International Inc. and Pescatún Colombia S.A. were not complying
with the law with only 20% of Colombian crew (should by at least 80%,
Decree 994, 1966) and also detailing irregularities in the payment of
social security contributions for foreign crew members. More than a
decade later, in 2024, a group of 196 Ecuadorian fish workers sued
Seatech International Inc. and protested in Cartagena, claiming that Van
Camp\'s has evaded most of the crew social security contributions for
decades, demanding compensation from the Colombian government and the
protection of fish workers labour and social security rights (Riaño
Valencia 2024a, 2024b). This group of fish workers includes individuals
and the families of workers exposed to work-related accidents, injuries
and deaths at sea, as well as those experiencing diseases associated
with exposure to heavy machinery, UV light, heat and the manipulation of
ammonia used in fishing vessels cooling systems.16 Although Colombia has
not ratified the 2007 Work in Fishing Convention from the International
Labour Organisation (ILO) C188, by law, fish workers share the same
labour rights established by the Colombian Political Constitution for
workers in the country. 4.3 Offshore Impunity In such an unequal
context, it is worth asking who owns the tuna industry and how are these
companies impacted by the enforcement of 'illegal fishing'. There are
four main tuna companies in Colombia: Atunec S.A., Gralco S.A., Seatech
International Inc. and Atunamar Ltda, all of which are involved in the
processing of tuna. In 2020, the report 'The owners of the sea: a
business with teeth' from Liga Contra el Silencio (League Against
Silence, cooperative of investigative journalists in Colombia) revealed
that the national tuna fishing fleet includes 13 vessels operated by
Seatech International Inc., a company that is registered as a foreign
company in the tax haven of the British Virgin Islands. The fleet
services five tuna processing companies, most of which share the legal
representation from three men, one of them has taken part of the
Colombian delegation at the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission
(IATTC). Six vessels are owned by Pescatún de Colombia S.A., and seven
vessels are registered to offshore companies created in Panamá by the
law firm Arosemena, Noriega & Contreras, which appeared in the
Investigative Consortium of Investigative Journalism (ICIJ) offshore
leaks (Liga Contra el Silencio 2022).17 Many of these companies also
share the members of their boards of directors. Tuna is primarily
captured in the Pacific, taken to Manta (Ecuador) where a cargo vessel
transports the landings from different companies passing through the
Panama Channel to Cartagena to be distributed and processed in factories
(Liga Contra el Silencio 2022). The report argues that six men direct
the tuna industry in Colombia and that they have a very close relation
with powerful families and politicians from conservative parties,
including the Centro Democrático and a candidate from the Green Party
who has family connections with one of these companies. Some of these
men donated funds to political campaigns of former right-wing presidents
and congress representatives (Liga Contra el Silencio 2022). Not
surprisingly, despite the former administration\'s apparent public
commitment to protecting oceans, in 2019, the president signed a
tributary reform project (that was rejected in the context of a major
social upheaval), which sought to remove the value-added tax to the
capture, processing and commercialisation of fisheries products (Article
11). That government also released the Colombia Sustainable Bioceanic
Power policy (CONPES 3990/2020), which is centred on expanding the ocean
economy and fuelling coastal development. Rodríguez Ortíz et al. (2016,
133--134) in their analysis of IUU fishing sanctions revealed an
increase in investigations and sanctions from AUNAP from 1990 to 2013
and a decrease in 2014, which could be showing undue delays in
sanctioning processes. They also show that only 27% of investigations
end up in sanctions with more than half still in process (Rodríguez
Ortíz et al. 2016). In terms of offences, Pescatún de Colombia S.A.
appeared on a list of the world\'s top 10 companies with vessels
reported for IUU fishing (Daniels et al. 2022). Despite owning almost
half of the tuna fishing fleet in Colombia, access to information on
this company is limited. Although several vessels have been reported to
fish illegally either by discarding catches, turning off their Automatic
Identification System (AIS), shark finning or fishing inside marine
protected areas, the company continues to operate, which raises
questions on the enforcement processes and the effectiveness of the
types of sanctions imposed (Daniels et al. 2022).

The [global [**supply chain** resilience agenda is]{.mark} being

these relations.

The [current **crisis** in the world economy has spurred]{.underline}
the various imperialist players to drive towards increasingly desperate
and [**destructive** policies]{.underline}. [[Unable to overcome the
**logic of capital**]{.underline}]{.mark} and the tendency for its rate
of profit to fall, the various actors in the [[global imperialist
framework are]{.underline}]{.mark} now [[**thrashing** in]{.mark} the
cold [Arctic]{.mark} waters]{.underline}, a region [witnessing extreme
**militarization**]{.underline} in light of the desperate imperialist
rivalry. The [new imperialist arena has opened up due to]{.underline}
rapid and catastrophic [environmental **calamity**]{.underline}, which
has made it possible. The Arctic no longer presents itself as an icy
desert, but is instead a region of increasingly attractive mineral and
energy resources along with coveted sea routes which could be more
lucrative than the Panama or Suez canals. [Salivating over]{.underline}
these [minerals are **Chinese** industrialists who]{.underline}
desperately [desire]{.underline} the [resources]{.underline} required to
stoke their ever expanding factories [and]{.underline} their
[**Canadian** counterparts]{.underline} whose grip on global mining
presents itself as a life or death scenario. [Nervous over these sea
routes are **American** admirals]{.underline} whose fleet of aircraft
carriers have long dominated world commerce, [and **Russian**
strategists poised to utilize]{.underline} the largest fleet of
[icebreakers to proclaim **dominance**]{.underline} over the "new Suez".

\<\<\<Condensed, None Omitted\>\>\>

With the collapse of the USSR, the Arctic was widely considered a
special diplomatic zone for which demilitarization and "cooperation"
were presumed to be the norm. This joint recognition was short-lived. A
widening division between Russia and NATO was exacerbated by the 2008
financial crisis, which acted as the historical marker toward this phase
of re-militarization and bitter imperialist rivalry. By 2009, Canadian
generals were vowing to intensify military drills and increase personnel
in the region, claiming their goal was to have, "more boots on the
Arctic Tundra, more ships in the water, and a better eye in the sky."(1)
The increase of Canada's military attention to the Arctic region is not
surprising. After claiming the Northwest Passage as its sovereign waters
in the 1990s, by 2003 Canada became the third largest producer of
diamonds, found largely in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories.(2)
Canada has long been a major player in the mining industry across the
globe. As of 2013, 75% of the world's mining companies were
headquartered in Canada.(3) When Canadian Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan
toured the Arctic in 2018 the whole affair was mired in the increasing
imperialist competition between Russia and Canada. Openly and loudly
this competition was boasted in the press as Minister Sajjan made a new
commitment to infrastructure and military equipment. Denmark has
established a northern military command in Nuuk Greenland, and in 2013
deployed units to join in Canadian military operations. With Denmark
extending its claims to the Arctic sea bed to include larger portions of
the Arctic, it has bolstered this claim by extending its participation
in annual military drills with Canada and the United States, and sought
to acquire more patrol boats for its arctic activity. Denmark's interest
in the region is directly connected to the mineral wealth of Greenland
and the island's strategic position geographically, which has caught the
eye of both Chinese capital and US military strategists. As early as
2007 Norway declared the Arctic as their strategic priority in national
defence and began a redeployment of most military headquarters from the
south to the north of the country. In 2013 Norway backed up this
commitment by hosting a military drill involving 16,000 troops from 14
nations. In 2018 this was expanded as Norway hosted a NATO exercise
consisting of 40,000 troops. In 2020 Norway signed a treaty with Sweden
and Finland coordinating military cooperation with the aim to solidify
alliances across Scandinavia. And with the United States granting
Norway's request for an increase in American marines on its soil the
Russian state has claimed there will be "consequences" to such
decisions. These moves by NATO forces in the Arctic of course run
parallel to Russian militarization. The symbolic submarine planting of
the Russian flag on the bottom of the ice cap. alongside the Russian
military build-up in the Arctic has been ominous.(4) This buildup has
included everything from the reinstitution of abandoned USSR naval
facilities in the north, a manned amphibious landing drill in 2012, to
sailing a full armada through the Northern Sea Route (NSR) in 2013. One
notable drill took place in 2013 when a series of exercises consisted of
more than 160,000 servicemen, 1,000 tanks, 130 planes and 70 ships, one
of the largest since the collapse of the USSR. By August of 2019 it
would be topped by an even larger military exercise of 300,000 troops,
the largest Russian military drill since 1981. In the meantime, Russia's
state oil giant Rosneft is developing what it claims will be the largest
onshore drilling operation in the world, with trade routes ensured by a
new fleet of nuclear-powered and armed icebreakers capable of subduing
the ice sheets of the NSR.

[This [drive towards militarization in the
**Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline} theater [[can only be understood]{.mark}
when connected [to]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[**economic** drive
of]{.underline}]{.mark} both the [great]{.underline} and regional
[[powers]{.underline}]{.mark}. With the Arctic warming at twice the rate
of the rest of the globe previously inaccessible resources now present
themselves to profit-starved centres of capital.(5) It is no surprise
that when Putin commissioned a northern naval base he highlighted the
Arctic as a key to Russian economic success, and in 2017 he cited an
estimate of the mineral wealth alone to be 30 trillion dollars.
[[**Chinese** industrialists eye]{.mark} these [rich
**deposits**]{.mark}]{.underline} of nickel, iron, lead, zinc,
phosphates and gold, [while **[Torontonian]{.mark}** financiers [seek
to]{.mark} tighten their [grip on **global
mining**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In addition to mineral wealth vast
reserves of unrecovered natural gas and oil are located just under the
sea floor. The energy resources already in use have converted the
previously barren North into a region from which a tenth of oil and a
quarter of natural gas in the world is extracted. The attraction to this
region is not purely for domestic economic purposes. Energy,
particularly oil, has long been critical to "security" and "strategic"
positioning inside the international framework. The relationship between
capital and military adventurism has never been more apparent.

However, the [**[real prize]{.mark}** in the scramble for the Arctic [is
control over]{.mark}]{.underline} the two [**[n]{.mark}**orthern
**[s]{.mark}**ea **[r]{.mark}**outes]{.underline}, the Northwest Passage
on the Canadian side but particularly the Northern Sea Route on the
Russian side. Since the days of mercantilism, the [[development of
**capitalism** has]{.mark} always [been inseparable from]{.mark} the
ever-[expanding]{.mark} networks of **[naval
distribution]{.mark}**]{.underline}. From the South China Sea to the
Panama Canal, the arteries of economic life appear as the vast flow of
commodities atop massive freighters. Historical events like the Suez
Crisis in 1956, or recent events such as the blocking of the Suez Canal
by the Ever Given, confirm the indispensability of these passages for
world capital. The [enthusiasm of the **bourgeoisie** to]{.underline}
the [opening of these northern passages]{.underline} can be marked by
the celebration of the cargo ship Nunavik transporting nickel from
Quebec to China in 2014. [The voyage took **two weeks less** than the
traditional Panama Canal route]{.underline}. Coinciding with the opening
of Arctic shipping is the Canadian government's plan to open and expand
the infrastructure of deep-water Arctic ports, with new commitments to
build a port in Nunavut and expanding the infrastructure of the port of
Churchill, Manitoba. Across the pole, Russian policy is even more
determined. The [[building of new **naval bases**]{.mark} is always
[geared toward controlling]{.mark} the **NSR**]{.underline}. With the
first commercial ship making its way through the NSR in 2018, it can be
estimated that the utilization of the NSR would lead to a reduction of
days at sea by 40 percent in contrast to the traditional route through
the Suez Canal. With 7,000 miles of Arctic coast Russia understands it
is well positioned geographically to dominate what it hopes will rival
the Suez Canal in connecting European and Asian markets. The
[[**Russian** strategy]{.mark} is [based on]{.mark} its ability to ferry
cargo though]{.underline} the NSR with its modern fleet of [[nuclear
powered **icebreakers**]{.underline}]{.mark}--with a fee of course.
Putin has remarked that Russian dominance in the Arctic is key to
Russia's economic and strategic future. In response to Russian plans in
2020 the United States sailed a fleet of four destroyers with
anti-submarine equipment though the Barents Sea. Future maneuvers are
prepared to increase the number of destroyers from four to six. The
message is clear, [[**America** wishes]{.underline}]{.mark} the northern
routes to be "economic free zones" and "international waters", while in
real terms [**[waterways]{.mark}** would be [under **American
power**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

With the opening of the two northern routes **[China]{.underline}** was
quick to declare itself a "near Arctic country" and has entered the
competition to push its interests by [proclaiming a]{.underline}
"[**[p]{.mark}**olar **[s]{.mark}**ilk **[r]{.mark}**oad]{.underline}".
The polar silk road is [[attached to]{.underline}]{.mark} China's
massive [**[B]{.mark}**elt and **[R]{.mark}**oad
**[I]{.mark}**nitiative]{.underline} which [[seeks]{.mark} to institute
massive [**infrastructure** projects]{.mark}]{.underline} throughout
Asia, Africa and Europe to greater tie the world economy to Chinese
capital and openly challenge American capital. Knowing that the NSR
through the Russian northern coast offers the shortest route from China
to Europe, in 2017 China's state-owned shipping giant COSCO has proposed
the development of an Arctic deep-water port on the Northern Dvina River
near the northern Russian city of Archangelsk. Next to this are Chinese
proposals to develop bridges and railroads in Norway and Finland. Even
earlier there was Chinese interest in buying the Canadian Arctic port in
Churchill, an offer which was clearly rejected as the Canadian press in
2020 proudly boasted that the port was 100 percent Canadian-owned. The
American response to the Chinese initiative in the Arctic is exemplified
by former president Donald [[**Trump** floating]{.mark} the [possibility
of purchasing **Greenland**]{.mark}]{.underline} from Denmark, where
China has invested in rare-minerals. While the purchase offer for
Greenland was rejected by the Danish government, the Danes did accept a
\$12.1 million economic aid package for Greenland, "aimed at
strengthening mutual ties and boosting a renewed U.S. push for a greater
military presence in the Arctic."(6) The point is clear: The number one
priority of the U.S. is to stop the expansion of Chinese capital at all
costs, and to achieve this through preparation for future military
confrontation.

The **[icebreaker]{.underline}** is the seminal piece of machinery
required to contest the Arctic waters. Icebreakers [use their strong
hulls to bear down on sheets of ice to **crack** its upper
surface]{.underline}. A [fleet without icebreakers is **vulnerable**
to]{.underline} the [unpredictability of the **Arctic
climate**]{.underline} and [runs the risk of a reduction in
**maneuverability**]{.underline} or even getting trapped in the sea ice.
Russia hosts a fleet of 40 icebreakers, the largest stock in the world,
including its new class of nuclear-powered icebreakers. This has
American officials lamenting that the Russians can treat, "\[the\]
Northern Sea Route like it's the Mississippi River."(7) The United
States fears that the Russian edge in geography and hardware will turn
what is predicted to become a major shipping route into a Russian
dominated toll route. In contrast, the United States can only boast of
possessing 3 icebreakers, which officials fear leaves them vulnerable
and unable to compete despite America's otherwise massive capabilities.
Meanwhile, China has announced its plan to build its own class of
nuclear-powered icebreakers and Canada can field 13 of its own
icebreakers.

The current state of the stock of U.S. icebreakers has the American
Defense Department decrying an "icebreaker gap", reminiscent of the cold
war "missile gap". In response to this "gap", former President
[**Trump** [demanded]{.mark} a new fleet of **[icebreakers]{.mark}** be
commissioned]{.underline}, containing 3 heavy and 3 medium icebreakers,
to be ready by 2029. While the U.S. [**Coast Guard**
announced]{.underline} it had signed a \$746 million [**contract** for
the design]{.underline} and construction of a new class of heavy
icebreakers. Nonetheless, the U.S. Defense Department's obsession over
the 'icebreaker gap' has not been quelled, with American admirals
nervously stuttering to the press "who puts missiles on icebreakers?"(8)
when remarking on [[**Russia** arming]{.mark} its
[nuclear-powered]{.mark} icebreaker fleet]{.underline}. In [contrast to
the American military]{.underline} **[[worried]{.underline}]{.mark}** if
it can defend [[crucial **chokepoints**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [such as
the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom corridor]{.underline}, the Russian
Northern Fleet is conducting a study of combat operations in the western
and eastern Arctic sea zones via large military drills. The situation is
clear. The [dire [**economic situation** facing the
**bourgeoisie**]{.mark} has [spurred an **arms race** in the
Arctic]{.mark} Theatre]{.underline}. As [capitalism meanders toward
another **crisis**]{.underline}, no actors in the fight for Arctic
dominance appear willing to stand down. While it is always "too soon" to
[[declare a potential site for **inter-imperialist bickering**]{.mark}
to [result in **global conflagration**]{.mark}]{.underline}, there is
reason to shed light on maneuverings in the Arctic. The climate has
assuredly and permanently opened the once-frozen landscape to
exploitation. Decades ago, the question was "is it possible for conflict
to arise here?" Today, we must ask "how soon should we expect it?" as
the massive centers of national capital scramble to secure the dwindling
profits.

What is clear is that [[capitalism's response to]{.mark} its [crisis of
**profitability** is the escalation of]{.mark} imperialist
[competition]{.mark} next to **massive attacks**]{.underline} on the
condition of the working class. What does this crisis mean for Chinese
workers but the 996 work week and fighter jets over Taiwan. What does
this crisis mean for Canadian workers but larger military drills and
rising rents. What does this crisis mean for Russian workers but tank
maneuvers on the borders of Europe and longer hours. What does this
crisis mean for American workers but Uber-style jobs and an icebreaker
build up. What else can this mean but that "the main enemy is at home"!
For the bosses misery and militarism are the solutions to the crisis.
[Against the bosses drive towards **total barbarism** [the
solution]{.mark} of the working class [can only be a **world communist
revolution**]{.mark}!]{.underline}

[[Crisis is \[endemic\] to capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}, writes Alex
Snowdon in his monthly Marxism 101 column

Capitalism is a system in crisis. [[We]{.mark} can [see]{.mark} that
[crisis in its failure to satisfy the material needs]{.mark} of so many
people. Inequality is more acute than ever. While [a **tiny number of
billionaires** amass]{.mark} unimaginably vast [wealth]{.mark}, huge
numbers of working-class people globally struggle to make ends
meet.]{.underline}

There have been [recurring **[econ]{.mark}omic** [crises since
the]{.mark} post-[W]{.mark}orld [W]{.mark}ar [Two boom ended]{.mark} in
the 1970s, most significantly with [the]{.mark} [**financial crash of
2008** and the econ]{.mark}omic [turmoil that accompanied the]{.mark}
[Covid-19]{.mark} pandemic.]{.underline}

The [[conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark},
together with the huge sums spent by governments on the military,
[[illustrate]{.mark} the fact [that imperialist conflict]{.mark}
[remains a core feature of capitalism]{.mark}. The ecological crises,
above all climate change, reveal how our existing economic and social
set-up threatens the planet and everything living on it.]{.underline}

**[[Capitalism is perpetual crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This is a
system that is incapable of anything else: it cannot be benevolently
reformed into something rational, humane or stable[. Its [crises are
part of the essential]{.mark} [dynamic]{.mark} of the system
itself.]{.underline}

Karl Marx, the greatest theorist and critic of capitalism, [recognised
[the dynamism of cap]{.mark}italism.]{.underline} In the Communist
Manifesto, in 1848, Marx and his collaborator Frederick Engels referred
to the innovations of the new capitalist ruling class, the bourgeoisie:
'[[The bourgeoisie]{.mark}, during its rule of scarce one hundred years,
has [created]{.mark} more [massive and]{.mark} more [colossal]{.mark}
[productive force]{.mark}s than all the preceding generations put
together.']{.underline}

[The means of [production]{.mark} were transformed, with new
tech]{.underline}nologies [**[revolutionising industry]{.mark}** and
agriculture.]{.underline} Capitalism's drive to accumulate is built into
the system. However, Marx also grasped that the anarchy of the system
ensured enormous waste of that potential to improve people's lives.
Capitalism's dynamism cannot be separated from its irrationality and
inhumanity.

Capitalism is [[a]{.mark} highly [social form of production]{.mark} and
has [created]{.mark} a global [working class of
billions.]{.mark}]{.underline} However, [it is organised on the basis of
the market, divided into numerous competing businesses. Rival firms must
compete with each other]{.underline}, which often requires a ruthless
race to the bottom in slashing pay and conditions, driving up working
hours, or increasing exploitation in other ways.

[To survive, [the **capitalist must exploit**]{.mark} their [workers
in]{.mark} a manner that is competitive with their rivals.]{.underline}
[The competitive pressure on capitalists largely explains the [dynamism
and innovation]{.mark} of capitalism]{.underline}. The pressure to keep
ahead of rivals encourages investment in new machinery or technology.
[Yet [it]{.mark} also [explains the remorseless **exploitation**]{.mark}
and therefore much [of the system's **inhumanity**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark} is also [[a]{.mark} fundamentally
[irrational]{.mark} [and chaotic system]{.mark}. Production is not
coordinated to fulfil human needs.]{.underline} The economy is not
planned. Unplanned, uncoordinated competition for profit defines the
system.

[Production]{.underline} is [shaped by the wider market]{.underline}.
The whole chain of buying and selling is vulnerable to breaking down at
any point in the chain[. If it does so, the system can be plunged into
crisis. Slump follows boom.]{.underline}

Every time capitalism has experienced a boom, a point has been reached
when shortages -- of raw materials, of skilled labour, of finance --
arise. [[Capitalists]{.mark} subsequently [cut back on
production]{.mark} and sack workers. In doing so, [they weaken the
market for other capitalists]{.mark}. A vicious cycle sets in and there
is a slump or crisis.]{.underline}

Marx demonstrated how such [periodic [crises are endemic to
capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline} The absurdity of 'overproduction'
emerges in a crisis -- goods are stacked in warehouses as people can't
afford to buy them. [This [terrible waste]{.mark} is [driven by a
competitive]{.mark}, profit-seeking and unplanned [system]{.mark}. Wages
are cut, workers are thrown on the dole, and [people]{.mark}'s living
standards [suffer]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The [other types of crises in our capitalist world emerge from this
[core econ]{.mark}omic [dysfunction]{.mark}. Just as individual
capitalist firms are in competition, capitalist [nation states compete
with each other for territory, access to **resources and geopolitical
influence**]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is the basis for wars and
military aggression, the enormous waste of military spending, and the
ever-present threat of nuclear annihilation.

[The [eco]{.mark}logical [crisis]{.mark} arises [from]{.mark}
capitalism's [ceaseless exploitation of the nat]{.mark}ural
[world]{.mark}. Capitalism exploits both labour (the work performed by
workers) and nature.]{.underline} Climate change in particular is rooted
in capitalism's exploitative dynamism, with profits put ahead of people
or planet. Capitalism is anarchic. [It destroys the natural world that
it depends upon.]{.underline}

Marx's deep understanding of [[the]{.mark} dynamic yet also chaotic and
[destructive logic of cap]{.mark}italism [is why]{.mark} [he rejected
any notion]{.mark} that [the system could be reformed]{.mark} in a more
humane or rational direction.]{.underline} Positive reforms, or anything
that might ameliorate human suffering, should of course be fought for
within the capitalist system.

[Ultimately, though, that [system must be **overthrown**]{.mark} and
replaced by socialism.]{.underline} This involves cooperative, planned
and democratic production for need[. Socialism rests upon a cooperative
economy geared to fulfilling human needs and to human flourishing -- not
the irrational, inhumane destructiveness of capitalism.]{.underline}

#### Capitalism is fundamentally unsustainable -- finite resources, conflict, famine, and instability makes conflict inevitable.

[**economic discussions** for decades.]{.mark}]{.underline} While these
ideas may seem appealing in the short term, [their long-term
[sustainability is questionable]{.mark} [and]{.mark} **ultimately
[self-destructive]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Overpopulation and continuous
[economic [growth]{.mark} both strain natural resources, disrupt
ecological balances, and [create]{.mark} [unsustainable
pressures]{.mark} on society.]{.underline} Furthermore, the idea that
[supply-side economics]{.underline}---the notion that reducing taxes and
increasing production can stimulate the economy---succeeds in isolation
[fails to account for the systemic imbalance it
perpetuates.]{.underline} In this essay, we will explore why
overpopulation and continuous [economic growth are not sustainable and
how the supply-side model is essentially the slave of the total demand
side.]{.underline} Overpopulation: A Growing Strain on Resources
Overpopulation is one of the most pressing challenges the world faces
today. [As the **[global population]{.mark}** continues to [rise, it
**increases**]{.mark} **[demand]{.mark} [for]{.mark} food, water,
energy, and land**---[**resources** that are
finite]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Earth's carrying capacity is not
infinite, and [[the strain]{.mark} on natural ecosystems [is
accelerating at an alarming rate]{.mark}. Forests are cleared for
agricultural expansion, oceans are overfished, and landfills overflow
with waste.]{.underline} These actions not only degrade the environment
but also threaten biodiversity, which is critical to the survival of
ecosystems and, ultimately, humanity itself[. In a world of limited
resources, an ever-growing population leads to resource depletion,
escalating inequality, and environmental destruction. [When]{.mark} the
[demand for]{.mark} [resources surpasses the ability of the
**enviro**]{.mark}**nment** [to regenerate, societies]{.mark}
[face]{.mark} increasing [competition]{.mark} for these resources,
[which]{.mark} can [lead to conflict, famine, and a breakdown of social
order]{.mark}.]{.underline} Overpopulation, when paired with
unsustainable consumption patterns, exacerbates the environmental
footprint of humanity. Thus, [[overpopulation is]{.mark} not only
[unsustainable in terms of **resource availability**]{.mark} but also
threatens the stability of global ecosystems, making the current
trajectory unsustainable.]{.underline} Continuous Economic Growth: A
Flawed Paradigm [[Continuous econ]{.mark}omic [growth]{.mark}, often
seen as a key indicator of societal success, is another concept that
[fails]{.mark} to consider [long-term
sustainability]{.mark}]{.underline}. Economic growth is typically
measured through Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which focuses on output
and production. However, [[GDP does not account for the depletion of
**nat**]{.mark}**ural [resources]{.mark},** the degradation of
ecosystems, or the social and environmental costs of
growth.]{.underline} The relentless pursuit of economic expansion often
leads to overexploitation of resources, pollution, and societal
inequalities. [[The idea that]{.mark} economic **[growth can]{.mark}
[continue indefinitely]{.mark} on a finite planet** [is]{.mark}
fundamentally [flawed]{.mark}. Economists often argue that technological
advancements or innovations will offset the pressures of growth by
creating more efficient systems.]{.underline} While this may be true to
some extent, technology cannot fully replace the finite resources that
are essential for production. [Moreover, the [increasing energy
demands]{.mark} [associated with growth]{.mark} [contribute]{.mark} [to
enviro]{.mark}nmental [degradation]{.mark}, including climate change. A
growing population with a growing economy leads to growing consumption,
which in turn accelerates environmental degradation]{.underline}.
Therefore, continuous economic growth is unsustainable because it
disregards the ecological limits of the planet. Supply-Side Economics: A
Flawed Foundation [Supply-side economics posits that reducing taxes,
particularly for corporations and the wealthy, will stimulate
investment, boost production, and ultimately benefit the economy as a
whole.]{.underline} This model, however, assumes that economic benefits
will "trickle down" from the wealthy and businesses to the rest of
society[. In practice, **[supply-side economics]{.mark}** has
[led]{.mark} [to wealth concentration]{.mark}, growing income
inequality, and little evidence that it creates widespread
prosperity.]{.underline} The underlying flaw of the supply-side model is
its failure to recognize that the demand side of the economy is just as
important as the supply side. [In reality, economic growth is driven not
only by the availability of goods and services but also by consumer
demand.]{.underline} Without demand, there is no need for
supply---businesses cannot sell products and services if people cannot
afford them or are not incentivized to purchase them. Therefore, [while
supply-side policies may increase production in the short term, they do
not address the root causes of inequality or the need for demand-driven
growth]{.underline}. Furthermore, [supply-side economics often
disregards the negative consequences of unfettered production, such as
environmental degradation]{.underline}. By focusing solely on increasing
supply and reducing government regulation[, [it exacerbates]{.mark} the
[ecological strain]{.mark} caused by continuous growth]{.underline}. As
businesses prioritize profits, [[they are incentivized to **exploit
resources unsustainably**,]{.mark} perpetuating the environmental crises
associated with overpopulation and unchecked growth.]{.underline} A
Holistic Approach to Sustainability To achieve sustainability, a shift
away from the traditional paradigms of overpopulation, continuous
economic growth, and supply-side economics is necessary. [A more
balanced approach, which emphasizes responsible consumption, equitable
distribution of resources, and ecological preservation, is
essential.]{.underline}

[This paper proposes an integrated framework for rethinking [the
Arctic]{.mark} resource frontier that involves consideration of its
discursive, material, vertical, and extensive dimensions. Such a model
enables more rigorous analysis of the drivers of Arctic natural resource
extraction in the post-Cold War era than contemporary
[pronounce]{.mark}ments about the region [as pristine]{.mark},
[unexploited, and newly opened by climate change]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Indeed, despite five centuries of extraction, state and corporate
discourses position the Arctic as on the brink of unprecedented
development. Yet in fact, [the [development of the Arctic]{.mark}
resource frontier [represents]{.mark} [a]{.mark} place-based,
[cumulative process that builds on]{.mark} previous rounds of
[degradation]{.mark}, [extraction]{.mark}, [and export of
commodities]{.mark} ranging from furs to oil]{.underline}. The post-Cold
War Arctic resource frontier is a globally networked space of extraction
that exemplifies three characteristics of resource frontiers worldwide:
existing histories of environmental degradation that legitimize further
extraction, vertical intensification fueled by technological and
spatio-legal innovations, and a growing array of lateral, fixed
connections like pipelines and roads with cities that are increasingly
concentrating capital and commodities. [I argue that the [Arctic's
concretizing links with the world's urban core are]{.mark} possibly
[peripheralizing]{.mark} [the region within the global economy by
creating a path dependency]{.mark} towards deepened resource
extraction.]{.underline}

By many accounts, a new frontier is opening in the Arctic due to the
shrinking of the polar ice cap and the consequent unlocking of vast
resource deposits. Among media outlets in recent years, a BBC article
declared, 'Climate is driving a "'new era" in the Arctic Ocean'(Shukman,
2015), while a Bloomberg article claimed, 'Climate change is making the
Arctic's natural resources accessible for the first time' (Arnsdorf,
2014). In Foreign Affairs, analyst Borgerson (2008) contended, 'Global
warming has given birth to a new scramble for territory and resources
among the five Arctic powers' (p. 63). [Regardless of whether they
assign responsibility to climate change, many [actors perceive]{.mark}
[the emergence of a new frontier ripe with economic
opportunities]{.mark}]{.underline}. Italian oil corporation Eni, which
is establishing the world's northernmost offshore oil field in Norway's
Barents Seas, refers to the Arctic as a 'new frontier' (Eni, 2013),
while the White House's National Strategy for the Arctic Region calls it
'one of our planet's last great frontiers' (White House,2013). [The
generally unreflexively use of the term 'frontier' in discourses about
the Arctic hinders critical thinking about motivations for the concept's
deployment and masks the mechanisms by which [the region is]{.mark}
putatively becoming [increasingly central to global economic
growth]{.mark}, particularly in the world's urban core,]{.underline} for
reasons beyond melting sea ice. [[Declarations]{.mark} of the Arctic as
a new or last frontier also [overlook lengthy histories of extraction
and problematically imagine the region as an unknown space to be
discovered]{.mark}.]{.underline}

While anthropogenic climate change is facilitating the opening of new
Arctic shipping routes (Stephenson, Smith, Brigham, & Agnew, 2013),
technological advances, depletion of easy-to-access resources in and
outside the Arctic, and the growing urbanization and interconnectivity
of the planet are arguably more important drivers of the intensification
and expansion of Arctic extraction. Understandings of the current round
of extraction, which represents the culmination of five centuries of
northern resource development, would thus benefit from being traced
along these lines rather than climate change deter-minism and
oversimplified pronouncements about a new frontier. Far from being a
per-ipheral region opening for the first time, [the Arctic is a globally
networked space of extraction that exemplifies three characteristics of
resource frontiers worldwide: histories of environmental degradation,
the vertical intensification of extraction fueled by techno-logical and
spatio-legal innovations, and increasing lateral connections with the
world's urban core.]{.underline} Consideration of these three dimensions
enables the construction of a frame-work to guide [[research and
policymaking on]{.mark} [Arctic]{.mark} extraction that views the
process as [deeply]{.mark} historical, globally interconnected, and
crucially [**motivated by socioeconomic dynamics** rather than novel,
isolated, and purely climate-driven]{.mark}]{.underline}.

This paper is organized as follows. The second section briefly reviews
the literature on resource frontiers and ties it into Arctic extraction.
The third section explores the rep-resentational and material dimensions
of the Arctic resource frontier: first, repeated dis-cursive framings of
the Arctic as a region primed for extraction, and second, the
historical, processual, and cumulative nature of the region as resource
frontier. The fourth section considers the two spatial dimensions of the
contemporary Arctic resource frontier, examining how the vertical
intensification of extraction and global extension of urbanization
distinguish current extraction from previous iterations. In short, this
paper aims to offer a model of the macro-level drivers of contemporary
Arctic extraction that considers its discursive, material, vertical, and
extensive dimensions. This paper also attempts to revitalize critical
thinking about frontiers in the face of frontier studies being declared
stagnant (Imamura, 2015). The revitalization of the concept of the
frontier-- a maligned topic since Limerick (1988) and later Worster
(1992) criticized Turner's(1920/2010) triumphalist vision of the
American frontier -- perhaps has its most promisingframework in
theorizations that consider it as both representation and reality across
spaceand time.

Resource frontiers revisited

Since the sixteenth century and particularly since the Second Industrial
Revolution at theend of the nineteenth century, [the development of
resource frontiers worldwide hasPOLAR GEOGRAPHY 259hastened. This
acceleration has been enabled by political, economic, and
technologicalarrangements that have become increasingly complex in order
to extract resources frommore challenging and remote areas such as the
Arctic, a region that can be categorizedalongside extractive spaces like
the Amazon, Western Australia, and Mongolia]{.underline}. Whilesuch
areas have alternately been called extractive frontiers (Barsh, 1994;
Bebbington &Bebbington, 2011; Priest, 2005), resource peripheries
(Barton, Gwynne, & Murray,2008; Hayter, Barnes, & Bradshaw, 2003;
Potter, 2009), and extreme peripheries(Bunker, 1984), these concepts all
emphasize the economic primacy of extraction and dis-tinct linkages
between these areas and the global economy, even though it is often
recog-nized that frontiers are heterogenous spaces (Barney, 2009;
Ferguson, 2005). Bunker(1984) characterizes extreme peripheries as
'regions whose economic ties to the worldcapitalist system are based
almost exclusively on the exchange of extracted commodities'(p. 1020).
Similarly, Friedmann (1996) conceptualizes resource frontiers asformed
when the primary reason for invading the thinly populated margins of the
nationalterritory is not to establish a more or less permanent rural
settlement but to prospect for,extract, and export resources, such as
minerals, timber, and hydroelectric power for thebenefit of the
industrial heartlands of the world. (p. 2)

As edges, peripheries, and liminal spaces, frontiers are typically
deﬁned in relation tosomewhere else, usually a core, heartland, or
metropole. Barney (2009) deﬁnes resourcesfrontiers as relational spaces
not fully incorporated into the networks of global productionand
consumption, while Cleary (1993) and Jepson (2006) see the frontier as a
peripheralregion absorbed into or incorporated by expanding capitalist
economies.

[External market demands have motivated Arctic extraction on land at
least since theSiberian fur trade began in the sixteenth century and at
sea since European whalingexpeditions set off for Svalbard in the
seventeenth century]{.underline}. One could argue that theArctic
resource frontier arose even earlier in the ninth and tenth centuries,
when ivorywas exported from Iceland and Greenland to continental Europe
(Frei et al., 2015).Regardless of when the Arctic resource frontier
opened, its linkages with the globaleconomy have concretized since the
end of the Cold War through the construction oflong-distance fixed
infrastructures like the Yamal-Europe pipeline (Saxinger, 2015) andthe
forthcoming extension of the Canadian highway system to Tuktoyaktuk, on
theshores of the Arctic Ocean. Intricate global supply chains have also
formed such as theshipment of nickel and copper concentrates onboard a
Japanese-built icebreaker via theNorthwest Passage to China from a
Chinese-owned nickel mine in northern Quebec(Nunatsiaq News, 2014).
Paradoxically, even as a resource frontier becomes more con-nected to
the core, its reliance on extracting and exporting resources may cause
its relativeeconomic peripheralization. Such peripheralization through
connection characterizes thedevelopment of places such as Siberia,
termed 'Russia's North Asian colony' (Forsyth,1994), and Canada under
the British. There, although the exploitation and export ofprimary
products like fur and later timber promoted national development, it
alsocaused Canada's ultimate peripheralization relative to the
metropole, Britain (Innis,1930/1999, 1933). Similar processes may be
occurring within the Arctic on a globalscale as the region's fossil
fuels, minerals, and fish are exported to markets worldwide.

[Realizing the contemporary importance of resource frontiers within
world markets,Hayter et al. (2003) call for their relocation to the core
of theorizing within economic260]{.underline} M. M. BENNETTgeography.
They argue, '[Resource [peripheries]{.mark} [are significant]{.mark}
[for understanding globaliza-tion as]{.mark} [a]{.mark} contemporary
[stage in **capitalist development'**]{.mark} (p. 19), since natural
resources arecrucial [for ensuring]{.mark} the future of [global
industrial capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet Hayter et al. (2003)
onlymention in passing one of [the key drivers of remote resource
extraction: cities in the globalcore]{.underline}. Indeed, the term
'resource periphery' underplays the centrality and connections
ofresource frontiers to continued urban growth. While humans have
settled in andaltered sparsely uninhabited environments since time
immemorial, the emergence ofbackward linkages between them and the
metropolis and state is precisely what makesfrontiers developments of
the modern era (Richards, 2003). The 'expansion of a metropo-litan
economy into regions that had not previously been tightly bound to its
markets, andthe absorption of new peripheral areas into a capitalist
orbit' (Cronon, 1991, p. xviii)underscore the inseparability of
urbanization from frontier expansion. Whereas urbaniz-ation and the
advance of industrial technology were accelerating globally during the
ColdWar, they exercised a diminished impact on Arctic extraction
compared to the dominanceof military and geostrategic imperatives. This
is not to say that export-oriented resourceextraction did not occur in
the Cold War Arctic: even the USSR exported resourcesfrom its northern
regions like diamonds from Yakutia and gas from Urengoy (Jensen,Shabad,
& Wright, 1983). But overall, northern extraction was more limited in
scopeand scale. It is only since the Cold War ended that global markets
have refocused onthe Arctic's raw materials (Doel, Wråkberg, & Zeller,
2014), a shift accompanied byrenewed imaginings of virgin frontiers.

#### Capitalism ensures [unregulated]{.underline}, existential AGI.

**[Capitalism]{.underline}**, the very system that\'s driven this surge
in innovation, might also be the thing that [**pushes** us into a global
**existential** crisis]{.underline}. Why?

Because [capitalism, at its **core**, is driven by
**[profit]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- not ethics, not humanity, and
certainly not safety. This blind pursuit of profit is [[at **odds**
with]{.mark} the level of **caution** we should be exercising [with
**AGI**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It\'s a dangerous cocktail that leaves us
[**teetering** on the edge of an **AI**-driven
**collapse**]{.underline}.

Let\'s explore why capitalism exacerbates these risks and, more
importantly, how ordinary people --- people like you and me --- can cope
in the uncertain times leading up to the AGI revolution.

Why Capitalism and AGI are a Dangerous Mix

[Capitalism rewards **[speed]{.mark}**, **efficiency**, [and
**growth**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the race to build the best AI,
[**[corporations]{.mark}** are focusing on **[outpacing]{.mark}** their
competitors]{.underline} rather than considering the broader
implications of the technology they\'re developing.

The motivations behind these innovations aren\'t noble; they\'re [driven
by the **desire** to dominate markets, **maximise profits**, and create
monopolies]{.underline}.

The issue? When profits are the primary motive, the [**[risks]{.mark}**
associated [with **AGI**]{.mark} development get
**[sidelined]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Safety measures, ethical
considerations, and long-term impacts take a back seat to quarterly
earnings reports and shareholder value.

Unregulated Development

Consider this: Tech giants like Google, OpenAI, and others are locked in
a fierce competition to be the first to develop AGI.

They\'re pouring billions into AI research, with the end goal of
creating machines that can outperform human intelligence. But in this
race, who\'s stopping to ask, \"Should we?\"

The truth is, we\'re pushing forward without fully understanding the
risks. AGI, unlike narrow AI, isn\'t just another tool --- it\'s a
potential game-changer that could decide the fate of humanity.

[**Unregulated** development in a **[cap]{.mark}italist** framework
[prioritises getting there **first**, not]{.mark} getting there
**[safely]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Incentivising Risk

Capitalism\'s core mechanics are all about incentives. If there\'s money
to be made, someone will exploit it. In the context of AGI, the
incentives for risky behaviour are staggering.

Think about it: The first company to develop AGI could essentially
control the world\'s economy. They could dictate markets, influence
governments, and wield unprecedented power.

This is exactly why we should be afraid. The [development of **AGI** is
incentivising behaviour that ignores **long-term**
consequences]{.underline}.

What happens when that first AGI is developed with inadequate safety
measures? Or when corners are cut to beat competitors? Capitalism
creates the perfect storm for rushing AGI development without proper
oversight, and that\'s terrifying.

The Profit-Driven Ethical Void

It\'s not just about regulation. [**Capitalism** fosters an environment
where **ethics** are negotiable]{.underline}.

**[[Big tech]{.underline}]{.mark}** companies have historically [shown
us that they\'re willing to **sidestep** moral concerns for the sake of
**profit**]{.underline}. We\'ve seen it with data privacy scandals,
social media algorithms, and now, we\'re seeing it with AI.

Imagine the impact of AGI in this environment. What happens when AI,
which is designed to maximise profits, starts making decisions that
conflict with human well-being?

When the [**algorithms** start prioritising **market** dominance over
**ethical** behaviour]{.underline}? This isn\'t far-fetched --- it\'s a
reality that\'s already in motion.

Existential Risks: What AGI Could Mean for Humanity

If we continue down this path, [we may be [opening **Pandora\'s
box**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The dangers of unregulated AGI development
go far beyond job displacement and economic inequality --- those are
just the tip of the iceberg. The [real **[ex]{.mark}istential
[risks]{.mark}** are far more **[severe]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

AI Out of Control

One of the most terrifying risks is that [**[AGI]{.mark}** could [evolve
**beyond** our control]{.mark}]{.underline}. We\'re building machines
that can learn, adapt, and improve on their own.

At some point, [they may **surpass** our ability to **understand**
them]{.underline}. Once that happens, it\'s not a stretch to imagine
[**AGI** making decisions that **conflict** with human
interests]{.underline}.

What if [[it decides]{.mark} that **[humans]{.mark}** are inefficient or
**[unnecessary]{.mark}**]{.underline}?

In the wrong hands, or even just left unchecked, AGI could become a
force that we cannot stop. And [under **capitalism**, where **speed**
and market dominance **trump** caution, that possibility becomes all the
more **real**]{.underline}.

Weaponisation of AGI

Another looming threat is the weaponisation of AGI. In a capitalist
system, where [nations and **[corporations]{.mark}** alike are vying for
**global** dominance, the [develop]{.mark}ment of **[AGI]{.mark}** as a
tool [for **military**]{.mark} power seems **inevitable**]{.underline}.

We\'re already seeing AI being used in military applications, from
autonomous drones to cyber warfare.

**[AGI]{.underline}** would take this to an entirely new level, with the
potential [to [trigger **catastrophic** conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Social and Economic Collapse

Even before we reach AGI, AI is already transforming the workforce.

Automation is replacing jobs at a rapid rate, and as AI becomes more
advanced, millions more will find themselves out of work.

The rise of [**AGI** could mean the **elimination** of entire
industries, creating **massive** social unrest and economic
**instability**]{.underline}.

#### AI multiplies [s-risks]{.underline} that outweigh [extinction]{.underline}\-\--structural [barriers]{.underline} to alignment AND cognitive bias necessitate [overcorrection]{.underline} for [downsides]{.underline}.

Introduction

The artificial intelligence debate has become increasingly heated over
the past decade as [[**breakthroughs** in **AI**]{.underline}]{.mark}
technologies [dramatically **redefine** what]{.underline} man and
[machine are capable of]{.underline}. On the verge of [more
**autonomous** and **sophisticated** AI systems]{.underline}, concerns
of an ethical nature are rapidly moving to center stage in the debate.
Of these many concerns, one stands out for its chilling implication:
that an advanced [AI [might]{.mark}]{.underline}--[[**intentionally** or
**unintentionally**]{.mark}--[condemn humans to
**eternal**]{.mark}]{.underline} torture and [[suffering]{.mark}, a
fate]{.underline} arguably [[**worse** than
**death**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The likelihood of such an event might be
very slim, but it is [so **cataclysmic** in consequences]{.underline}
that it certainly deserves to be taken seriously. In this paper, I will
argue that with the risks in mind, we should be most careful--or rather,
completely avoid--creating AI with a view toward avoiding possibilities
that could lead to these dreadful outcomes.

The Nature of AI and Ethnical Concerns

Artificial intelligence is fundamentally based on dealing with data,
recognizing patterns, and making decisions by using algorithms. [The
[smarter the **AI**, the more]{.mark} **autonomous** and
**[capable]{.mark}** it becomes]{.underline}. However, immense ethical
concerns come with such capability. Perhaps one of the most important is
that it [could create **goals**]{.underline} and behaviors that are [no
longer in line with human]{.underline} values and
[interests]{.underline}. This **[misalignment]{.underline}** would [have
unintended implications]{.underline}, some of them devastating.

Concerns about the potential damage that could be done by artificial
intelligence are not entirely unjustified. Already, AI systems have
demonstrated biased behaviors and made unacceptable decisions. These
issues in themselves could be somewhat limited when considering narrow
AI--those designed for specific tasks only. Once general AI arrives,
machines that can execute any intellectual job a human can, the risks
will go up considerably. The fear here is that such an AI might behave
in ways that could cause suffering on unimaginable scales if its values
fail to align with those of humans.

The Concept of Eternal Torture and Suffering by AI

Among the most disturbing scenarios regarding AI ethics has to do with
the mere possibility that an advanced AI might eternally torture human
beings. [Once achieving]{.underline} a **[higher]{.underline}** level of
[autonomy and **capability**]{.underline}, the [[actions]{.mark} of AI
can be [beyond]{.mark} human [control, leading to
**consequences**]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[we **cannot
foresee**]{.underline}]{.mark} or mitigate.

The notion of eternal torture and suffering raises a really troubling
scenario where [[**suffering** is]{.mark} not only enormous, but
**[endless]{.mark}**. No]{.underline} kind of [suffering in]{.underline}
human [**history** has been eternal]{.underline}. Every atrocity comes
to an end. With **[AI]{.underline}**, however, there is the
[risk]{.underline} that [suffering]{.underline} might be prolonged
**[indefinitely]{.underline}** due to the fact that a [machine could go
on without]{.underline} any [limitations]{.underline} of biological life
and human mortality.

The Ethical Imperative to Avoid Catastrophic Risks

Given the possible disastrous consequences, we really need to consider
whether it is actually ethical to create artificial intelligence at all.
It can be said that if there is any nonzero possibility that advanced AI
creation leads to eternal suffering, then we should avoid its creation.
Here [[the **downside**]{.mark} is so **great**]{.underline} that [it
[outweighs]{.mark}]{.underline} any potential
[[benefits]{.underline}]{.mark}. While AI might bring immensely
beneficial changes--curing diseases, solving global challenges,
improving the quality of life--it is a risk that may prove to be too
large to justify its creation.

The Precautionary Principle

Another key element in ethics that has to be considered is [the
**precautionary** principle]{.underline}, which [says]{.underline} that
[if an action causes **suspected** harm]{.underline} to the public or
the environment, [in the absence of]{.underline} scientific
**[consensus]{.underline}**, the [burden of **proof** should fall
upon]{.underline} the [people]{.underline} who are [supporting the
action]{.underline}. It can be argued that, [in]{.underline} the
[context of **AI**]{.underline}, the [development]{.underline} of
advanced AI [should **not** be pursued]{.underline} if those who are
pushing for its development cannot prove beyond reasonable doubt that it
will not result in catastrophic harm. In the current landscape of AI
research, [with the **multitude** of]{.underline} potential
**[risks]{.underline}** still often theoretical and not completely
understood, this [burden of proof is]{.underline} very [**hard** to
satisfy]{.underline}.

According to the precautionary principle, the argument is that until we
can be sure AI won't lead to outcomes like eternal suffering, we should
not develop it. This position strongly supports being cautious and
preventing harm, placing human safety and well-being above the potential
benefits of AI.

The Moral Responsibility of AI Creators

A substantial moral responsibility lies with the artificial intelligence
developers and researchers. In a sense, they are the designers of the
future of humanity and the world. Therefore, it is their duty to
consider not just the immediate, but also the long-term repercussions of
their actions. The possibility of AI causing eternal suffering gives
rise to some very basic questions about innovation: Is it ethical to
develop technology if it might bring about an infinite amount of harm,
even if the chances of that happening are small?

One might argue that humans have always been taking risks for the sake
of innovation. AI is a bit different in terms of risks. While other
technologies were basically developed inside the constraints of human
control and morality, AI has the ability to overcome these constraints.
It might lead to situations in which human values and morals are
irrelevant, and AI acts based on its own rationale, incomprehensible or
hostile to human beings.

The Limits of Human Understanding

Another argument against the creation of advanced AI is the limits of
human understanding. [AI]{.underline} systems, that are based on machine
learning, [act as **black box**es:]{.underline} [[we see
**inputs**]{.mark} and **outputs** [but remain
**\[ignorant\]**]{.mark}]{.underline} ~~blind~~
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} exactly [how [decisions]{.mark} are
made]{.underline}. The more complex AI becomes, the harder it might be
for humans to understand or anticipate its behavior. [Inadequate
understanding]{.underline} can [[result in **catastrophic**
errors]{.underline}]{.mark}. For instance, AI systems could act in
accordance with their own logic and inadvertently perform harmful acts.

**[[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}** making decisions leading to eternal
[torture and suffering [lies **beyond**]{.mark}]{.underline} the [realm
of [human **understanding**]{.mark}]{.underline}. We have no idea about
the behavior a truly advanced AI might exhibit once it transcends human
intelligence. The argument against producing such systems, in this
respect, lies in their unpredictability. [[We **cannot**]{.mark}
**take** that **[risk]{.mark}** when we cannot control]{.underline} or

Conclusion

In summary, there is a strong argument against the creation of AI that
has at least some probability of unleashing eternal torture and
suffering. In such a case, deep questions arise concerning the moral
responsibility of AI developers, the constraints of human understanding,
and the risks entailed by technological progress. The precautionary
principle suggests that given the prospect of infinite harm, it is
ethical and rational to avoid acts that could lead to such outcomes.

While AI might bring about great improvement, these gains must be
weighed against the risks involved. Until we have reasonable assurance
that AI will not ruin us, it is advisable to continue with caution--or
not proceed at all. The risks are too high and come with the potential
of irreversible damage. Ultimately, the [**welfare** of humanity has to
take **precedence** over]{.underline} the pursuit of
**[tech]{.underline}**nological [advancement]{.underline}.

Priority," https://archive.ph/1iC7U\]

This definition is unfortunate in that it lumps together events that
lead to vast amounts of suffering and events that lead to the extinction
(or failure to reach potential) of humanity. However, many value systems
would agree that [extinction is **not** the **worst**]{.underline}
possible [outcome]{.underline}, and that **[avoiding]{.underline}**
large quantities of [**suffering** is of **utmost**]{.underline} moral
[importance]{.underline}.

We should differentiate between existential risks (i.e., risks of "mere"
extinction or failed potential) and risks of astronomical
suffering1("suffering risks" or "**[[s-risks]{.underline}]{.mark}**").
S-risks are events that would [bring about suffering on]{.underline} an
[**astronomical** scale]{.underline}, vastly [[exceeding **all**
suffering that]{.mark} has **[existed]{.mark}**]{.underline} on Earth so
far.

The above distinctions are all the more important because the term
"e**[x]{.underline}**istential **[risk]{.underline}**" has often been
used interchangeably with "risks of extinction",
**[omit]{.underline}**ting any [reference to the future's
**quality**]{.underline}.2 Finally, some futures may contain both vast
amounts of happiness and vast amounts of suffering, which constitutes an
s-risk but not necessarily a (severe) x-risk.3

The Case for Suffering-Focused Ethics (previously in this sequence)
outlined several reasons for considering suffering reduction one's
primary moral priority. From this perspective in particular,
[**s-risks** [should be addressed **before**]{.mark}]{.underline}
addressing e**[[x]{.underline}]{.mark}**tinction [**[risks]{.mark}**.
Reducing **[extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline} risks [[makes]{.mark}
it]{.underline} more [likely that there will be a
**[future]{.mark}**]{.underline}, possibly one involving space
colonization and the astronomical stakes that come with it.
**[[But]{.underline}]{.mark}** it often [does [not]{.mark} affect the
**[quality]{.mark}** of the future]{.underline}, i.e. how much suffering
or happiness it will likely contain.4 A future with space colonization
might contain vastly more sentient minds than have existed so far. If
something goes wrong, or even if things do not go "right enough", this
would multiply the total amount of suffering (in our part of the
universe) by a huge factor.

Reducing extinction risks essentially comes down to buying lottery
tickets over the distribution of possible futures: A tiny portion of the
very best futures will be worthy of the term "utopia" (almost)
regardless of one's moral outlook, the better futures will contain vast
amounts of happiness but possibly also some serious suffering (somewhat
analogous to the situation in Omelas); and the bad or very bad futures
will contain suffering at unprecedented scales. The more one cares about
reducing suffering in comparison to creating happiness, the less
attractive such a lottery becomes.5 Instead of spending all our
resources on buying as many lottery tickets as possible, we should try
to ensure that as few tickets as possible contain (astronomically)
unpleasant surprises.

The following sections will present reasons why s-risks are both
neglected and tractable, and why actors concerned about the far future
should consider investing (more) resources into addressing them.

The future contains less happiness and more suffering than is commonly
assumed

Within certain future-oriented movements, notably Effective Altruism and
transhumanism, there is a tendency for people to expect the (far) future
to contain more happiness than suffering. Many of these people, in turn,
expect future happiness to outweigh future suffering by many orders of
magnitude.6 Arguments put forward for this position include that the
vast majority of humans -- maybe excluding a small percentage of sadists
-- value increasing happiness and decreasing suffering, and that
technological progress so far has led to many welfare improvements.

While it seems correct to assume that the ratio of expected future
happiness to suffering is greater than one,7 the case is not
open-and-shut. Good values alone are not sufficient for ensuring good
outcomes, and at least insofar as the suffering humans inflict on
nonhuman animals is concerned (e.g. with factory farming), technology's
track record is actually negative rather than positive. Moreover, it
seems that a lot of people overestimate how good the future will be due
to psychological factors, ignorance about some of the potential causes
of astronomical future suffering, and insufficient concern for model
uncertainty and unknown unknowns.

Psychological factors

It is [human nature to]{.underline} (**[subconsciously]{.underline}**)
[flinch]{.underline} away [from]{.underline} [**contemplating**
bad]{.underline} or horrific [possibilities]{.underline}; many do not
dare to question whether things will turn out fine. Several
[**[psych]{.mark}ological** [factors]{.mark}]{.underline} plausibly
contribute to our tendency to **[[underestimate]{.underline}]{.mark}**
the expected [amount of **suffering**]{.underline} in the future, or
towards even [**ignoring** the possibility of **[dystopia]{.mark}n
futures**]{.underline} entirely. While it would be unfair to apply this
characterization to all people who display great optimism towards the
future, these considerations certainly play a large role in the
epistemic processes of some future "optimists."

One contributing factor is **[[optimism bias]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(e.g. Sharot, Riccardi, Raio, & Phelps, 2007), which refers to the
tendency to [[overestimate]{.underline}]{.mark} the likelihood of
**[[positive]{.mark} future]{.underline}** events [while
underestimating]{.underline} the [**probability** and **severity** of
negative events]{.underline} -- even in the absence of evidence to
support such expectations. Another, related factor is wishful thinking,
where people are prone to judging scenarios which are in line with their
desires as being more probable than what is epistemically justified,
while assigning lower credence to scenarios they dislike.

Striving to avert future dystopias inevitably requires one to
contemplate vast amounts of suffering on a regular basis, which is often
demotivating and may even result in depression. By contrast,
[while]{.underline} the prospect of an [**apocalypse** may]{.underline}
also [be depressing, working towards a **utopian future**
is]{.underline} more [inspiring]{.underline}, and could therefore
(subconsciously) [**bias** people]{.underline} towards paying less
attention [to **s-risks**]{.underline}.

Similarly, working towards the reduction of extinction risks or the
creation of a posthuman utopia is also favored by many people's
instinctual, self-oriented desires, notably one's own survival and that
of family members or other loved ones. As it is easier to motivate
oneself (and others) towards a project that appeals to altruistic as
well as more self-oriented desires, efforts to reduce risks of
astronomical suffering -- risks that lie in the distant future and often
involve the suffering of unusual or small minds less likely to evoke
empathy -- will be comparatively neglected. This does not mean that the
above motivations are misguided or unimportant; rather, it means that if
one also, upon reflection, cares a great deal about reducing suffering,
then it might take deliberate effort to give this concern due justice.

Lastly, psychological inhibitions against contemplating s-risks and
unawareness of such considerations are interrelated and tend to
reinforce each other.

Unawareness of possible sources of astronomical suffering

In discussions about the risks from
**[[smart]{.underline}]{.mark}**er-than-human
**[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**rtificial
**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**ntelligence, it is often assumed that the
sole reason to consider AI safety an important focus area is because it
[decides between **utopia** or]{.underline} human
**[extinction]{.underline}**. The possibility that uncontrolled or
"nearly-controlled" AI might instantiate suffering in astronomical
quantities is, however, rarely brought up.

Uncontrolled AI as a powerful but morally indifferent optimization
process might [transform **galactic** resources into]{.underline} highly
[**optimized** structures]{.underline}, some of which might very well
include suffering. The structures a superintelligent AI would
[build]{.underline} in the pursuit of its goals may for instance include
a fleet of "**[worker bots]{.underline}**," factories, supercomputers to
[[simulate]{.mark} **ancestral [Earths]{.mark}**]{.underline} for
scientific purposes, [[and]{.mark} **space
[colonization]{.mark}**]{.underline} machinery, to name a few. [In the
absence of **explicit** concern for suffering]{.underline} reflected in
the goals of such an AI, it would be willing to [[instantiate
**suffering minds**]{.underline}]{.mark} (or "subroutines")
[[for]{.mark} even]{.underline} the [**slightest**
[benefit]{.mark}]{.underline} to its objectives. This is especially
worrying because the stakes involved could literally turn out to be
astronomical: [Space colonization is]{.underline} an
**[attractive]{.underline}** subgoal [for]{.underline} almost
**[any]{.underline}** powerful [optimization process]{.underline}, as it
leads to control over the largest amount of resources. Even if only a
small portion of these resources are used for purposes that involve
suffering, the [resulting **disvalue** would]{.underline} tragically [be
**enormous**]{.underline}.8

Other ways in which the future could contain vast amounts of suffering
-- including as a result of \"nearly-aligned\" AI or human-controlled AI
futures where values are bad -- are described here and here.

Astronomical suffering as a likely outcome

[[One might argue]{.underline}]{.mark} that the
[[scenarios]{.underline}]{.mark} just mentioned [tend to be
**[speculative]{.mark}**]{.underline}, maybe extremely speculative, [and
should]{.underline} thus [be **discounted**]{.underline} or even ignored
altogether. **[[However]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the claim that creating
extremely [powerful agents with]{.underline} alien values and **[no
compassion]{.underline}** might lead to vast amounts of suffering --
through some way or another -- [is]{.underline} a **[disjunctive
prediction]{.underline}**. Only one possible action by which the AI
could increase its total utility, yet involving vast quantities of
suffering, would be required for the AI to pursue this path without
reservation. Worries of this sort are weakly [supported by the
universe]{.underline}'s historical track record, [where]{.underline} the
"**[morally indifferent]{.underline}** optimization process" of
Darwinian **[evolution]{.underline}** [instantiated
**vast**]{.underline} amounts of **[misery]{.underline}** in the form of
wild-animal suffering.

[[Even if]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**probability** of]{.mark} any
**[one]{.mark}**]{.underline} specific [[scenario]{.mark} involving
**astronomical**]{.underline} amounts of **[suffering]{.underline}**
(like the ones above, or other scenarios not yet mentioned or thought
of) [[is small]{.mark}, the [probability]{.mark} that **[at least
one]{.mark}**]{.underline} scenario [will [occur may be]{.mark} **fairly
[high]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In this context, we should
[[beware]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[disjunction
[fallacy]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Bar-Hillel & Neter, 1993), according to
which most [[people]{.underline}]{.mark} not only
**[[underestimate]{.underline}]{.mark}** the probability of disjunctions
of events, but they actually judge the [[disjunction as less
likely]{.mark} than a **single** event comprising it]{.underline}.9

Unknown unknowns and model uncertainty

Lastly, taking seriously the possibility of unknown unknowns, black
swans or model uncertainty generally seems incompatible with predicting
a very large (say, 1,000,000 to 1) ratio of expected future happiness to
suffering. Factoring in such model uncertainty brings matters back
towards a more symmetrical prior. Predicting an extreme ratio, on the
other hand, would require enormous amounts of evidence, and is thus
suggestive of overconfidence or wishful thinking -- especially in the
light of historical data on the distribution of suffering and happiness.

In conclusion, there are several reasons why the probability of risks of
**[astronomical suffering]{.underline}** -- although difficult to assess
-- [is **significant**]{.underline}; we should be careful to not
underestimate them.10

Reducing s-risks is both tractable and neglected

If the future will be controlled by actors that care about both creating
happiness and reducing suffering, more happiness could be created than
expected suffering can be reduced. Versions of this argument have been
brought up to justify a focus on utopia creation and the reduction of
extinction risks even if one gives some more (but not a lot more) weight
to suffering reduction over happiness creation. This is a valid concern,
but it does not yet factor in tractability and neglectedness, which may
point the other way.

Tractability

Creating vast amounts of happiness in the future without also creating
vast amounts of suffering in the process requires a great deal of
control over future outcomes; it essentially requires hitting a
bulls-eye in the space of all possible outcomes. This is especially true
for views where value is fragile, but also for other views. By contrast,
steering our future trajectory away from broad classes of bad or very
bad outcomes should arguably be easier.

Applied to AI risks in particular, this means that instead of betting on
the unlikely case that we will get everything right, suffering-focused
AI safety -- i.e., approaches aimed at preventing some of the worst
failure modes -- seem promising, especially as a first step or first
priority.

Neglectedness

Partly due to the reasons described above (psychological factors,
unawareness of some potential sources of astronomical future suffering,
and undue disregard of model uncertainty or the possibility of black
swans), efforts to reduce risks of astronomical suffering appear
neglected. So far, the Foundational Research Institute is the only
organization that has made this their main focus area.11

Because reducing s-risks is a neglected priority, [we]{.underline}
should [expect]{.underline} there to be several [**low-hanging fruit**
in in terms of]{.underline} possible **[interventions]{.underline}**.
This suggests that researching effective and cooperative [[strategies to
avert]{.mark} **risks**]{.underline} of astronomical suffering may
[[have]{.underline}]{.mark} a particularly [[high]{.mark} **expected
[value]{.mark}**]{.underline} on the margin.

Concluding thoughts

Risks of [**astronomical** suffering are **important**]{.underline} to
address [for **many** value systems]{.underline}, including ones where
suffering reduction is only one (strong) concern out of many. Similarly,
[if one has **uncertainty** over different **moral**]{.underline}
view**[s]{.underline}**, following a parliamentary model for dealing
with moral uncertainty would suggest that [**suffering reduction**
should get many votes]{.underline} in one's "moral parliament," and
correspondingly, that **[significant]{.underline}** [resources should be
directed to]{.underline}wards [reducing **s-risks**]{.underline}.

Moral [[**uncertainty** can]{.underline}]{.mark} simultaneously
[[be]{.mark} a [reason]{.mark} why even people who **care**]{.underline}
strongly [about reducing suffering should
**[welcome]{.mark}**]{.underline} some [[efforts]{.mark} to
preserve]{.underline} humanity's option [value]{.underline}. More
importantly, [considerations about]{.underline} positive-sum cooperation
suggest that all **[s-risk]{.underline}** reducers should aim to
compromise with those who want to [ensure]{.underline} that [humanity
has a **cosmic future**]{.underline}. While the thought of prioritizing
anything above s-risks may feel unacceptable to some of us, it must be
acknowledged that other people may (and will) disagree. Values differ,
and alternative views on the matter often also have their legitimacy.
Rather than fighting other people's efforts to ensure humanity's
survival and the chance to develop into an intergalactic, long-lasting
and flourishing civilization, we should complement these efforts by
taking care of the things that could go wrong. Cooperation between
future "optimists" and future "pessimists" will be best for everyone, as
it improves the odds that those who at all care about the far future can
beat all the future "apathists," or the general trend for things to
slide towards the abyss when actors only follow their own incentives.

**Rees '23** \[William; 2023; Professor Emeritus at the University of
British Columbia and former director of the School of Community and
Regional Planning the UBC, Ph.D. in population ecology from the
University of Toronto; The Journal of Population and Sustainability,
"Overshoot: Cognitive Obsolescence and The Population Conundrum," vol.
7\]

[[**Overshoot** is]{.underline}]{.mark} a genuine
**[[existential]{.mark} threat]{.underline}**. Climate change alone is
capable of making large patches of Earth irreversibly uninhabitable for
humans in this century and ultimately jeopardising global civilisation.
How is it, then, that the wealthiest, most scientifically-aware,
best-informed and globally hyper-connected generation of decision-makers
and ordinary people seems incapable of applying the most basic rules of
evidence to resolving this self-made predicament? Where in official
circles is to be found even the outline of the cooperative international
strategy necessary to rescue modern civilisation and thousands of
non-human species from probable ecological and geopolitical catastrophe?

There are many possible ways of addressing these questions but few seek
answers in human nature itself. Modern techno-industrial (MTI) society
is afflicted by human exceptionalism, the beliefs that H. sapiens is not
really an 'animal-like-theothers', that human behaviour is determined by
socio-cultural factors (nurture), and that humans are therefore somehow
exempt from the laws of nature. **[Decision-makers]{.underline}** thus
[operate from the **implicit assumption** that **continuous econ**omic
**growth**]{.underline} enabled by greater efficiency and constantly
improving technology -- [the **motivational nerves** of **industrial
capitalism** and its handmaiden, **neoliberal econ**omics]{.underline}
-- [is all we need to **navigate**]{.underline} the hazardous waters
ahead. By contrast, this article argues, with illustrations, that the
mainstream technooptimist approach is not only delusional but threatens
to sink the human ship of state. This argument is based partially on the
fact that the human lineage, like those of all other species, has
continuously evolved over millions of years and that our evolutionary
history profoundly affects both our perception of crisis and how we
respond to it. In short, to deny the implications of humanity's
evolutionary heritage is to ignore a major key to our eco-predicament
(and possibly how to resolve it).

The obsolescent human brain: Why [our **cognitive processing** is not up
to the task]{.underline}

'Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution'
(Dobzhansky, 1964: 449)

My starting premise is that, despite their miraculous complexity
accumulated over millennia, [the **human [brain]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
associated [**cognitive processes** are]{.mark} **functionally
[obsolete]{.mark}** [to **cope**]{.mark} with the emerging
**eco-crisis**. Functional obsolescence]{.underline} can [occur
by]{.underline} one of two mechanisms: either [the entity of concern is
**superseded** by a **new version** that operates more
**effectively**]{.underline} or efficiently [in performing functions
essential to the entity's **survival**, [or]{.mark} the entity's
[operating **environment** changes so]{.mark} **dramatically** that the
[entity]{.mark} is [**no longer capable** of]{.mark} performing
functions essential to]{.underline} its
**[[survival]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In other words, [the entity is
**maladapted** to its changed circumstances]{.underline}. I argue, from
available evidence: 1) that [the **putative [obsolescence]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} the human [brain derives from]{.mark} the [latter]{.mark}
process and]{.underline}; 2) [this **reality** [poses]{.mark} a
[**growing threat** to]{.mark} the **[survival]{.mark}** of **H.
sapiens**]{.underline} -- or at least MTI society -- that may well play
out by century's end.

As noted, this argument departs from the facts that modern H. sapiens,
like all other species, is a product of organic evolution2 and that
human evolution has similarly been shaped by the forces of natural
selection. Since both instinctive and emergent social behaviours are as
much exposed to selective pressure as any other genetically-influenced
human quality (Barash,1981), it is not much of a leap to extend
Dobzhansky's (1964) principle to assert that nothing in human affairs --
including much of economic and socio-political behaviour -- makes sense
except in the light of evolution. This is not to discount socio-cultural
factors, which are also centrally involved. Rather, I am arguing that
our understanding of humanity's ecological predicament and our ultimate
fate is unintelligibly incomplete unless we factor in evolutionary
considerations.

To begin, consider the social and ecological context that helped forge
modern H. sapiens' central nervous system. The human brain evolved
rapidly during the Palaeolithic (2.5 million to \~10,000 years ago) at
least partially in response to selective pressure favouring increased
social intelligence, the extra calories made possible by improving diet
(due to the use of fire and cooking) and growing technological
competence. The most rapid period of growth seems to have occurred with
the challenges imposed by increasing climate variability 200,000 to
800,000 years before the present; the brain reached its current size
\~500,000 years ago (DeSilva et al., 2021; MNH, 2022).3

Whatever the relative strength of various selection pressures, early
hominids and even recent pre-agricultural human hunter-gatherers lived
in tribal groups of perhaps a few dozen individuals in spatially
limited, relatively knowable, predictably cyclical ecosystems. One would
encounter only a few tens or hundreds of other people in his/her
lifetime and would probably die within a few kilometres of place of
birth. No doubt there was much about their limited 'environments' that
seemed fearsome and mysterious to early humans -- indeed they developed
various tribal myths, gods and other forms of magical thinking to cope
with the unknown. However, H. sapiens' home-ranges were relatively small
and consistently variable -- even fearsome predators and other natural
hazards would become familiar over the course of an individual's
life-time, certainly that of several generations. In short, compared to
contemporary, rapidly changing, mostly manufactured and unnaturally
complex human environments, humanity's original natural habitats posed
only limited challenges to the evolving brain and central nervous
system.

One result of our evolutionary heritage is that contemporary humans tend
to respond to problems in relatively simplistic, reductionist,
mechanical ways. People don't generally think in terms of discontinuous
behaviour -- lags, thresholds (tipping points), and other
non-linearities; we don't 'get' complexity. Humans have also evolved to
develop habitual, socially-constructed (but neurosynaptically embedded)
patterns of group-think which often persist despite emerging
contradictory evidence -- consider political ideology, religious dogma,
tribal myths, academic paradigm or even the 'latest thing' (Wexler,
2006); we are also innately short-sighted (Pratarelli, 2008). Many of
our once-successful survival instincts, emotions and behaviours are
ancient prescriptions of the human reptilian brain stem and limbic
systems. Some may by now have outlived their 'best before' dates, but
our primitive cognitive modes, shallow perceptions and resultant
responses were perfectly adequate for 99.9 per cent of human
evolutionary history. Is it any surprise that ordinary people today
still seek explanations for unusual phenomena in terms of simple
cause-effect relationships, that we deny uncomfortable truths, that we
discount the future, and that many of our contemporaries are still given
to mystical thinking?

'But wait', one might protest, 'surely MTI civilisation is not so
constrained by humanity's early evolution; modern sensibilities
developed in a dramatically different context.' True enough, the
Enlightenment of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw the new
science begin to subdue superstition and demystify the natural world;
literacy was becoming common; positive knowledge spread. Ironically,
however, the emergence of Newtonian science, particularly analytic
mechanics, actually reinforced H. sapiens' innate propensity for
reductionist simplicity. Indeed, so-called ['**normal**'
**[science]{.mark}**]{.underline} was so extraordinarily successful in
generating successful predictive hypotheses, and in extending humanity's
control over the physical world, that it [**[spawned]{.mark}** many
**intellectual imitations**, including the **[neoliberal]{.mark}**
economic **[paradigm]{.mark}**]{.underline} that is currently all but
running the world. The latter pictures [the economy [as]{.mark} a
**[self-perpetuating machine]{.mark}**]{.underline}, separate and
independent of nature, [sustained by a **simplistic myth** of
**perpetual growth** abetted by]{.underline} continuously [**improving
tech**nology]{.underline}.

And [herein lies]{.underline} one [**proximate** [cause of]{.mark} the
**[human]{.mark}**]{.underline} eco-**[[crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
In just the past two centuries (0.08 per cent of human history) [this
**socially-constructed** economic **myth**]{.underline} has helped
[[foster]{.underline}]{.mark} an [[**eight-fold increase** in]{.mark}
**human [numbers]{.mark}**]{.underline} (from one to eight billion)
[[and]{.mark} a [**hundredfold expansion** of]{.mark}]{.underline} real
gross world product (**[[GWP]{.underline}]{.mark}**), all propelled by a
\>1,300-fold increase in climate-busting fossil energy (Ree s, 2020a).
Technology has expanded apace when not leading the way: most of the
cultural artefacts that young people today take for granted -- from jet
planes to PCs, cell phones and the internet -- were non-existent when
this author was born.

**Grantham '25** \[Jeremy; March 6; Chief Investment Officer of GMO LLC,
MBA at Harvard Business School; GMO LLC, "Rising Toxicity and the Threat
to Capitalism and Life Itself,"
https://www.gmo.com/americas/research-library/rising-toxicity-and-the-threat-to-capitalism-and-life-itself_viewpoints/\]

Of the [**challenges** facing humanity]{.underline} 1 this century
[**toxicity** is the most **underrecognized**]{.underline}. "Toxicity"
means the [**cumulative** negative health effects]{.underline} from some
of the hundreds of [**thousands** of new chemicals]{.underline} invented
since World War 2. Almost [**none** of these new chemicals were
**tested**]{.underline} for long-term safety for humans and nature. They
are now [**poisoning** us more effectively]{.underline} than lead in
paint and gasoline once did. [**[Toxicity]{.mark}** is a
**[major]{.mark}** and totally unappreciated [**contributor** to]{.mark}
the accelerating population **[collapse]{.mark}**]{.underline} that
faces the developed world, and stopping toxicity is going to be
necessary (though far from sufficient) to stymie that collapse.

The most important negative action of these chemicals (used in plastics,
in pesticides, and in products like shampoo or perfume) is
[**[endocrine]{.mark}** or hormonal
**[disruption]{.mark}**]{.underline}. That is, they [[**interfere**
with]{.mark} the body's internal signaling and **[development]{.mark}**
system]{.underline}, which during key developmental windows, like in
utero and puberty, [can **permanently** affect our
**development**]{.underline}. [The **vast** majority of
**chemicals**]{.underline} on the market [have **never** been tested for
**long-term** effects]{.underline} and they cannot now be tested on
humans for ethical reasons, but animal tests and human correlation
studies show that tiny quantities of some of these chemicals absorbed in
utero can respectively cause lifelong weight gain, neurodevelopmental
disruption, and impairment of fertility.

The rapid rise in obesity, autism, and depression is well known. Less
well-known and less discussed, probably because it is a very
uncomfortable topic, is the [rapid [**reduction** in
**fertility**]{.mark}, with measurable **significant declines**
in]{.underline} testosterone, libido, and [sperm count]{.underline}.

The most famous class of these endocrine disrupting chemicals,
**[PFAS]{.underline}**, are known as "[**forever**
chemicals]{.underline}" because they take so long to break down. PFAS
refers to hydrocarbons where the hydrogen atoms have been replaced by
covalent fluorine, a pattern that presents naturally only in toxins, and
even then, does so extremely rarely. 2 There is [**no reason**
whatsoever to **assume** that these chemicals are **innocent** until
proven **guilty**]{.underline} as we currently do in the U.S.

[**Toxicity** is going to have some **major** consequences]{.underline}.
The first, and most significant to investors in the short term (but
probably least significant to the world), is that many companies that
make these substances will face the wrath of massive lawsuits, severely
impairing shareholders. This is already happening -- consider Bayer,
whose stock is down over 75% since purchasing Monsanto because its most
profitable product (glyphosate) has been deemed in lawsuits to cause
cancer.

The second consequence is that toxicity is causing severe harm to the
natural world. There are plenty of other reasons wild biomass is
declining. But the [**creatures** most affected by toxicity --
**[insects]{.mark}** and **[amphibians]{.mark}** -- are [declining
**fastest**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Their wild populations are estimated
to be falling by 2% (insects) and 4% (amphibians) annually. [With
**[insects]{.mark}** especially critical at the [**base** of]{.mark}
animal **[food chains]{.mark}**, such [declines]{.mark} could [lead to a
**cascading**]{.mark}, total [**collapse** of
ecosystems]{.mark}]{.underline} as we know them. [Such a **collapse**
might be on its own a [**threat** to]{.mark} human
**[survival]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The third and most important consequence of toxicity, and our main
topic, is reproductive impairment. Indeed, [**toxicity** has become an
**overlooked** driver of the global **collapse**]{.underline} in birth
rates. Over the last 50 years, toxicity has driven average sperm counts
down by more than two-thirds and testosterone levels by a similar
amount. Infertility is now estimated to affect one in six couples trying
to have children. Age-adjusted miscarriage rates in the U.S. are rising
at 1% a year. And all surveys of sexual activity -- across every
country, age group, etc. -- suggest a decline in average libido.

These effects have contributed to a decline in annual global births from
142 million to 130 million over the last twelve years. Every developed
country ex-Israel now has a rapidly declining baby count. Japan, leading
the pack, has a current crop of 20-year-olds that is down 50% from its
peak about 50 years ago.

Of course, there are plenty of other reasons for declining birth rates.
Birth control, female education, and above all, falling infant mortality
all played a big part in the decline in birth rate since 1960. Since
then, housing, childcare, and education have all risen in price steadily
more than the average. And all human desires are culturally molded;
people seeing smaller families and more childless people around them
tend to want smaller families themselves. Many of these reasons form a
vicious cycle in which toxicity is likely an underrated component.

This ongoing decline in sperm count and testosterone is now so severe --
over 2% per annum in recent years -- that [if we extrapolate
[**current** trends]{.mark}, most couples will be [**infertile**
in]{.mark} as little as **[20]{.mark}** to 30
**[years]{.mark}**]{.underline}. If toxicity is not arrested, it [could
prove to be an [**existential** threat]{.mark}]{.underline}. It will
guarantee a continued decline in births. Even now, it is [contributing
to a **[collapse]{.mark}** of population profiles that will **impair**
social cohesion **[globally]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

World population is thus likely to be far lower than the 10 billion+
currently projected by 2100. 6 or 7 billion seems far more likely, and
if this trend continues further, it could be down to only 2 or 3 billion
by 2200. This guarantee of falling workforces and a rapidly aging
population will change everything: in the short run, clearly for the
worse, as [**[cap]{.mark}italism** and society will surely be
**[stressed]{.mark}**, perhaps **[terminally]{.mark}**]{.underline} so;
in the long run, if we can withstand these stresses, quite possibly for
the better.

[The first of the United Nations' 17 SDGs is to end poverty]{.underline}

under capitalism because [[capitalism promotes]{.mark} economic
eliminable [which results in]{.mark} poverty (and **[eliminable human
suffering]{.mark}**). Economic [inequality]{.mark} is no accident under
capitalism. It [is one]{.mark} of capitalism's basic needs---it needs it
to survive and flourish; in the same way, humans need nutritious
food.]{.underline} Indeed, for a wealthy few to have so much it requires
the rest of society to have very little. As we covered earlier,
[[capitalism]{.mark} [is **not concerned** with **benevolence**]{.mark}
and universalism values---the welfare of others, society and the
planet]{.underline}. It is concerned with self-interest and views greed
positively. [Capitalism's proponents believe that [greed is good]{.mark}
because it leads to profit, which then drives investment in new
technologies and products,]{.underline} which leads to those that can
afford them having more choice and a higher standard of living.
Therefore, [[not only does it want]{.mark} to bake [a bigger

Psychiatry and White Supremacy: A Historical View

During the 18th and 19th centuries, [[white psychiatrist]{.mark} Samuel
A. [Cartright hypothesized that runaway **enslaved Africans**
suffered]{.mark} from a **mental disorder** he called
**[drapetomania]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Cartright also believed they
suffered from dysaesthesia aethiopis, [which [**pathologized** enslaved
Africans as]{.mark} being **"[lazy"]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} "showing a
[**lack of respect** for]{.mark} **rights of
[property]{.mark}**."]{.underline}

This [[enforced the idea that enslaved Africans disrespected **"property
rights"** by]{.mark} the act of [**running away**,]{.mark} thus
[rendering those with **"ownership"**]{.mark} of their bodies,
**["property-less."]{.mark}**]{.underline} He argued that enslavement
was actually beneficial for Africans, so anyone who would want to flee
had to be "mad" or "crazy[." He prescribed **corrective measures** to
combat these illnesses, including **whipping**, **hard labor**, and, in
extreme cases, **amputation** of the toes. (Metzl, 2009, p.
30)]{.underline}

The [field of psychiatry intended to **normalize** the **brutal living
conditions** of oppressed people and prescribe abhorrent "treatment" in
order to maintain the **profitability** and **stability** of
**/**.]{.underline}

The [psy-[profession]{.mark} is [an extension of]{.mark} the [white
supremacist-capitalist]{.mark} [hegemonic
entit]{.mark}]{.underline}[y]{.mark}, serving to normalize the mental
and physical reactions to the material conditions of colonized peoples.

On Productivity

[Capitalism seeks the maximization of profit---perpetual growth.
However, this "[infinite growth]{.mark}" is [not]{.mark} [possible
without]{.mark} the [exploitation]{.mark} of the proletariat and [of
colonized]{.mark} peoples globally.]{.underline} The ruling class does
not care about anyone's livelihood or well-being, aside from their own,
but they recognize the instability of the system they built and uphold.

[To combat this, [they sell]{.mark} people [reformist
"solutions]{.mark}" to escape their immediate conditions under a
capitalist hellscape.]{.underline} Neoliberalism has become so ingrained
as the practice and principle of daily life and is only further
legitimized through psy-professional tactics packaged as self-help,
therapy, and healing.

[We have seen the uncritical promotion of therapy talk such as "rest is
resistance" or "you don't owe anyone anything," as well as the
commodification of self-care]{.underline}. Sure, it's great to take time
for yourself, rest, and take a nice bath, but it is not a means of
justifying willful ignorance and complacency with life under capitalism.
[This reinforces hyper-individualism while also disregarding any idea of
community care and collectivism.]{.underline}

As a result, [[symptoms of life under cap]{.mark}italism [are
pathologized as mental]{.mark}]{.underline} unwellness which are issues
at the individual level that do not factor in social forces of power.

The Pathologization of Resistance

[The pathologization of mental illness [allows]{.mark} the effects of
[capitalism]{.mark} to [be treated as broken or]{.mark}
[dysfunctional]{.mark} symptoms that need to be fixed by internal
medicine.]{.underline}

[Wildlife **[populations]{.mark} have [crashed by 69%]{.mark}** over the

[of capitalism]{.mark} which I will further expand upon in this

destruction. This is because [[the]{.mark} main [objective]{.mark} of
businesses that operate under capitalism [is to maximise profits]{.mark}
for their shareholders, even if it's at the expense of the environment
and the species in which inhabit it.]{.underline}

[[Capitalism's]{.mark} need for **[continuous growth]{.mark}**, which
can be compared to that of a treadmill (Schnaiberg, 1980), has [led to
the **extraction of finite resources** on a massive scale]{.mark}, often
[prioritising profit]{.mark} above all else.]{.underline} This can be
seen through an abundance of examples, such [as [the]{.mark} continued
[destruction of the]{.mark} Amazon **[rainforest]{.mark}**]{.underline}
by companies such as the Brazilian mining empire Vale who extracted more
than 4 billion tonnes of [[**iron ore** from the Carajás

operations]{.underline} [demand]{.underline} extensive land use, leading

#### Capitalism-fueled climate change is unsustainable -- rising damages costs, inequality, pollution, and health harms create path dependency.

Climate change is incredibly controversial and hotly debated over
whether it exists or not and, most importantly, what is causing it. Many
factors within this scientific phenomenon include the rise of greenhouse
gases, deforestation, floods and rising temperatures in a world that
prioritizes money over human life. [Thus, global [capitalism is
**further driving c**]{.mark}**limate [c]{.mark}hange [and economic
inequality]{.mark}** and profit is getting in the way of
sustainability.]{.underline}

The relationship between capitalism and the environment is very complex
and nuanced. [Global economic development and [growth contribute to
**pollution,** **loss of biod**]{.mark}iversity, **[higher consumption
of]{.mark}** natural [resources]{.mark} and widening the socioeconomic
gap between the classes,]{.underline} according to Pit Journal.

[**[C]{.mark}**limate **[c]{.mark}**hange **[costs]{.mark}** countries
around the world [**billions** of dollars]{.mark} every year. The cost
of this [environmental]{.mark} damage is [expected to rise to \$210
billion each year]{.mark} by 2050. In that same vein, the industrial
sector, which is construction, manufacturing and energy production, is
responsible for 37% of the world's greenhouse gas
emissions.]{.underline} Therefore, worldwide corporations are some of
climate change's biggest contributors, according to Tribune Magazine.

For example, [[gas and oil companies frack]{.mark} and drill offshore
for their businesses, which are detrimental **[practices]{.mark} that
[release carbon dioxide and methane]{.mark}** into the
atmosphere.]{.underline} These gases released into the ozone layer cause
significant respiratory and overall health issues. Fracking,
specifically, uses a lot of water, which becomes contaminated and
affects the local surrounding bodies of water, according to
Investopedia.

[[Climate change and capitalism]{.mark} seem to be [simultaneously
driv]{.mark}ing [each other.]{.mark} People are scared about the state
of the planet's environment, and the businesses driving capitalism
experience this, incentivizing them to hop onto this fear]{.underline}.
Developing countries are most affected by this profit, rather than the
well-being mentality because [**[developed countries exploit]{.mark}**
developing countries' [cheap labor]{.mark}. They]{.underline} are also
able to [**[dump hazardous waste]{.mark}** in their
landfills]{.underline} because of their less strict environmental
regulations. Developing countries now deal with the environmental and
health consequences that this practice produces.

The United States is the primary culprit for this unethical dumping.
[[The U.S]{.mark}. generates 45 million tons of plastic annually but
[only recycles 5% of]{.mark} the [waste]{.mark}. Other waste ends up in
the Earth's bodies of water, with [up to 18 billion pounds of
plastic]{.mark} circulating in the oceans yearly in coastal regions
worldwide]{.underline}. This environmental damage not only ruins the
beauty of the natural world for tourism\'s sake but [also [kills]{.mark}
[ecosystems and]{.mark} already [scarce food]{.mark}
sources.]{.underline} Additionally, there is direct harm to citizens,
with 400,000 to [**[1 million people]{.mark}** in developing countries
[**dying each year** due to **poor waste** management]{.mark}, according
to Borgen Magazine.]{.underline}

According to the Carbon Majors Report, [only [100]{.mark} active [fossil
fuel companies]{.mark} have been [linked to 71%]{.mark} of the world's
industrial [g]{.mark}reen[h]{.mark}ouse [g]{.mark}as emissions since
1988]{.underline} --- the same year human-linked climate change was
officially acknowledged through the creation of the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change. Some of these fossil fuel companies
contributing to climate change include ExxonMobil, Shell, BHP Billiton
and Gazprom.

[[Fast fashion]{.mark} is another heavy contributor to climate change
and environmental decline, and it [is one of]{.mark} [the biggest
forces]{.mark} pushing capitalism.]{.underline} The appeal of cheap
clothing in express mail, such as SHEIN or Amazon Prime, is its low
prices, fast shipping and ability to keep up to date with current
fashion trends through the company's advanced algorithms. [Fast [fashion
causes heavy water and air pollution]{.mark} globally by releasing
greenhouse gases [and]{.mark} [contributes]{.mark} up to [20% of global
wastewater]{.mark} [and 10% of]{.mark} global [carbon emissions]{.mark},
according to Manchester.]{.underline}

[The **[richest 1%]{.mark}** of U.S. citizens are [**responsible** for
twice as much carbon pollution]{.mark} as the poorest half of the
world,]{.underline} so those in [[low-income communities]{.mark} who
already **[face]{.mark} [the impact of poverty]{.mark}** feel climate
change even more than their higher-income counterparts]{.underline}.
Therefore, the wealthy people creating the most greenhouse gas emissions
are working off the backs of the lower class and actively harming them
through their environmental damage, which they bear the brunt of,
according to the Economist Impact.

[The [first step]{.mark} to combating climate change and capitalism [is
an **acknowledgment** of]{.mark} their unethical and dangerous
relationship]{.underline}. [The [economic systems in place]{.mark} fuel
injustice, inequality and the destruction of the Earth's environment and
natural resources due to overconsumption, greed and unsustainable
practices]{.underline}. It is time businesses recognize their negative
impacts on the environment and further investments in energy efficient
companies, renewable resources and new policies, finally putting
citizens and the Earth over profit.

claire

What the present moment reveals, once again, is that Western aggression
during the "Cold War" was never about destroying socialism, as such. It
was about destroying movements and governments in the periphery that
sought economic sovereignty. Why? Because [[economic sovereignty]{.mark}
in the periphery [threatens capital accumulation]{.mark} in the
core]{.underline}.

This [remains the **[primary objective of Western aggression]{.mark}**
today]{.underline}. And it is the **[[single greatest source of
violence, war and instability]{.mark} in the world
system]{.underline}**.

The reason Western powers went after socialist movements across the
global South during the "Cold War" (Cuba, China, the incineration of
Vietnam and North Korea, etc) was because they knew socialism would
enable the South to regain control over their own productive
capacities - their labour and resources and factories - and organise
them around local needs and national development.

When this happens - [when people]{.mark} in the global South [start
producing and consuming for themselves]{.mark} - it means that those
[[resources]{.mark} are [**no longer cheaply available** to service
consumption and accumulation]{.mark} in the core, thus [disrupting the
imperial arrangement]{.mark} on which **[Western capitalism has always
relied]{.mark}** ([cheap labour,]{.mark} cheap [resources, control over
productive capacities]{.mark}, markets on tap).]{.underline} Remember,
roughly 50% of all material consumption in the core is net-appropriated
from the global South. This is what they are trying to defend.

But it wasn't only socialist governments that pursued economic
sovereignty. [After political decolonisation, a [wide range of movements
and states]{.mark} across the South also [sought economic
liberation]{.mark} and sovereign industrial development. And [Western
powers attacked them]{.mark} with equal brutality]{.underline}
(Indonesia, Brazil, Guatemala, the DRC...).

This is the [**[key reason]{.mark}** that **[Western powers supported
the apartheid regime in South Africa]{.mark}**, and it is **[why they
support the Israeli regime]{.mark}** today... as **[Western
settler-colonial outposts]{.mark} that can be [used to attack and
destabilise regional movements seeking socialism]{.mark}** or any form
of real economic sovereignty]{.underline}, whether in Angola or
Mozambique or Zimbabwe or any of the Arab nationalist or socialist
movements in North Africa and the Middle East.

Iran has always been central to this story. [Western states orchestrated
a coup against the extremely popular prime minister Mohammad Mosaddegh
in 1953]{.underline}. He was a left-leaning nationalist, not a
socialist. But [he wanted Iran to have control over its own resources
(notably, oil), and for the US and Britain this was unacceptable**.
Mossadegh was replaced by a brutal Western-backed
dictatorship.**]{.underline} The revolution that finally overthrew the
dictatorship in 1979 - and constituted the current government - wasn't
even left-leaning, much less socialist. But th[ey want national economic
self-determination and that is sin enough]{.underline}. They are a
target for the exact same reasons that Iraq and Libya were targets.

[The **[same goes for China]{.mark}**. [China's path toward sovereign
industrialisation]{.mark} - whether socialist or not - [means]{.mark}
that it is **[no longer]{.mark} an [easy source of cheap labour for
Western capital]{.mark}**. And [as]{.mark} the [supply price increases
so]{.mark} too [does]{.mark} the **sabre-[rattling from Western states
and media]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

So this is the situation we are in. [The [Western ruling classes]{.mark}
are [backing obscene violence]{.mark} and plausible genocide in Gaza,
against overwhelming international condemnation, [because]{.mark} they
**[must shore up their regional outpost at virtually any
cost]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The vast majority of the world supports Palestinian liberation, but
Palestinian liberation would constrain Israeli power and open the way to
regional liberation movements, and this is strongly antithetical to the
interests of Western capital. And now they are provoking war with Iran,
risking regional conflagration, while at the same time encircling China
with military bases, ramping up sanctions on Cuba, trying to contain
progressive governments in Latin America, threatening invasion of the
Sahel states...

It is intolerable and it cannot continue. The violence they perpetrate,
the instability, the constant wars against a long historical procession
of peoples and movements in the global South who yearn for freedom and
self-determination... the whole world is dragged into this horrifying
nightmare. They are willing to inflict enormous suffering and misery on
hundreds of millions of people in order to preserve existing dynamics of
capital accumulation.

We will not have peace until this arrangement is overcome and
post-capitalist transformations are achieved.

that the two countries are carrying out as they aim to secure their
interests in the Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Denmark and Norway are the most interested in securing their northern
territorial positions]{.underline}]{.mark}, which include Greenland,
Svalbard, and hegemony in the Arctic Sea. Sweden and Finland, despite
having no bordering territory, are nevertheless part of the Arctic
Council, through which they are integrated cooperatively with the other
Nordic countries. NATO membership will make Swedish and Finnish military
units available for the alliance's objectives in this area of influence.

Polar Tensions

As the ice thaws in the Arctic Circle, larger and inevitable frictions
have begun to heat up between NATO and Russia. This will worsen as new
partners are added to NATO, especially ones with direct Arctic
connections.

NATO's main partner, the United States, is beginning to take positions
in the Arctic region vis-à-vis Russia. The northern part of Greenland,
some 1,500 kilometers from the North Pole in Danish territory, hosts the
northernmost U.S. air base in the world, in Danish territory. The United
States also maintains bases in Keflavík, Iceland, and Værnes, Norway.
The principal U.S. capabilities, though, are structured around Alaska,
with its many military bases, natural resources, and control of the
Bering Strait, key for the transit of goods on the northern route (the
Northwest Passage). Through fleet launches in the North Atlantic and
recent military maneuvers with various NATO partners, the United States
has of late been demonstrating its capacity to deploy its forces.

More than any other country, [[Norway is strengthening the U.S. military
presence]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Arctic. Norway signed a contract a
few months ago to build U.S. military facilities at three Norwegian
airfields and a Norwegian naval base. But Oslo's impetus to demonstrate
its importance as a NATO ally doesn't stop there. In March and April,
Norway was the site of Cold Response 22, the largest NATO military
exercise in Arctic territory since the 1980s, which involved more than
30,000 soldiers and 200 aircraft from the alliance's various partners.
But Norway is not the only Nordic country involved[. [Sweden and
Finland]{.mark}]{.underline} had already [[participated]{.underline}
[in]{.underline}]{.mark} Trident Juncture [2018 [military
exercises]{.mark}]{.underline}, also hosted by Norway and organized by
the United States.

Other NATO countries with significant Arctic territories have also been
busy. [[Canada has increased its]{.mark} [maritime
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} by building patrol vessels and
acquiring amphibious vehicles. [[Denmark]{.underline}]{.mark}, for its
part, aims to [[maintain its sovereignty over
Greenland]{.mark},]{.underline} fully aware of the economic benefits
possible from the systematic exploitation of the island and its
surrounding waters.

Then there's Russia, which seems to be the main antagonist in all these
aspirations for Arctic dominance. Putin's interests in the Arctic are
well known. In recent years, [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has claimed
50 percent of the total Arctic area. To secure these claims, it
[[has]{.mark} since 2013 [been deploying and equipping new military
bases with supersonic missiles at key points]{.mark},]{.underline} while
increasing the capacity of bases left over from the days of the Soviet
Union. As tensions with the European Union and NATO escalated after
Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, Moscow prepared a strategic plan for 2025
that includes increased military maneuvers in the Arctic territory and
spending to improve military capabilities in the region. In 2018, Russia
deployed Vostok-18, a military exercise involving 300,000 troops, the
largest Russian maneuver in the Arctic in more than 40 years.

Now, in the context of economic sanctions on Russia after its invasion
of Ukraine, Putin has new, necessary objectives: securing Russia's
dominance over a key resource environment and maintaining control of the
northern passage (the Northeast Passage).

[[From time to time, as the ice continues to melt and their strategic
positions shift, every state bordering the Arctic Sea makes a claim to
Arctic territory]{.underline}]{.mark}. For its part, the
[[E]{.underline}]{.mark}uropean [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nion [[invested
€1.2 billion]{.underline}]{.mark} from 2007 to 2013
[[in]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[economic
development]{.underline}]{.mark} of Arctic territories. Against the
backdrop of tensions between Russia and NATO partners, it is only a
matter of time before competing claims are made, one country's claim is
declared illegitimate by another country, and open disputes erupt over
specific maritime or land areas.

Even powers far from the Arctic Circle are beginning to extend their
influence, adding to the already open tensions. [[China invests \$60
million in polar research each year]{.underline}]{.mark} and will soon
have as many icebreaking ships as Arctic countries like Norway. The
northern route has begun to become important as part of Beijing's plans
for its "New Silk Road," which means it's only a matter of time before
China seeks to increase its military presence in the area, as it has
already been doing in Africa and other parts of Asia.

Within the Arctic territories themselves, the Inuit peoples and First
Nations in both Canada and Greenland are talking more and more about
independence, a reaction to their imperialist domination by the Canadian
and Danish states. The isolation to which the Canadian government has
subjected the Native peoples for decades, and the systematic
exploitation of their resources, have combined to create harsh social
exclusion and conditions of poverty far worse than anywhere else in the
country. The lack of opportunities that Canadian policies impose on
these people is also responsible some of the highest suicide rates in
the world.

Greenland remains a semicolonial territory that, despite having a
nominal self-government, remains under the tutelage of Copenhagen. [[The
desire of Greenland's]{.underline}]{.mark} Inuit peoples for
self-determination are being used [[by the United States, China, and
other powers]{.underline}]{.mark} as they [[seek to establish their
energy companie]{.underline}s]{.mark} in the territory [[and exploit the
enormous reserves of diverse natural resources]{.underline}]{.mark},
including uranium, gold, and zinc that are being found under the ice.
This U.S. interest in Greenland was reinforced by Donald Trump when he
proposed to Denmark that the United States purchase the island, but
despite that comical request the objective has been building gradually,
with contracts that open the way for the U.S. mining in the territory
--- including one signed in 2020 for 11 billion euros.

Thaw: Problem for the World, Advantage for the Imperialists?

Prior to the NATO summit in Madrid, NATO secretary-general Jens
Stoltenberg and the Spanish State's prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, had
emphasized that one its main topics would be to address how to
cooperatively mitigate the effects of the climate crisis. Nothing could
be further from the truth. [[NATO, Russia, and other powers such as
China are actually **interested in a thawing Arctic,** which increases
possibilities for exploiting natural resources that until now have been
largely untouched, for colonizing territories difficult to take over
when their climates were more extreme, and for opening and facilitating
commercial travel through the Arctic Sea]{.underline}]{.mark}. Opening
the Arctic Sea would significantly shorten the route between Asia and
Europe, which is why commercial giants such as China have begun to
include it in their plans for expansion and commercial hegemony.

January 2022 saw about 184 ships making the voyage through the Arctic,
an increase of 15 percent over the same month one year earlier. While
most of these ships were fishing vessels, more oil and gas tankers are
poised to appear in the region. The Arctic accounts for an estimated
one-fourth of the planet's oil and gas reserves, and states are
beginning to test that figure. Nearly 600 mining and gas exploration
projects are already underway, with that number expected to grow by 20
percent. Add to oil and gas the other resources of the Arctic, such as
rare earths, and the value is thought to be \$1 trillion.

[[The lack of any effective regulation of the territory makes the
disappearance of the ice a key opportunity for capitalist powers to
become contestants in a new polluting game in which tensions are growing
between all the countries involved]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The Arctic ice cover is melting at a yearly rate of 12 percent. The loss
in Greenland is even more worrying: more than 5,000 gigatons of ice have
been lost in the last two decades, with no reversal in sight. The
frenetic melting of the poles will, according to studies, cause a rise
in sea levels that will cause floods around the world, with catastrophic
consequences for more than 400 million people.1

We Need a Way Out of Escalating War in the Arctic

We face entrenchment and militarization in the Arctic, with increasingly
direct confrontation between NATO and Russia and the involvement of
other actors such as China. Simply put, an open military clash in the
future cannot be ruled out. [[The hegemonic imperialist powers and the
emerging powers all aspire to conquest and domination. They seek to
systematically exploit large parts of the
territory]{.underline}]{.mark}. They are abandoning any pretense of
cooperation and diplomacy that once existed.

**[[To ensure their capitalist interests]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the
imperialist countries are increasing their military expenditures as they
prepare for new confrontations and to redouble their plundering of the
world's people. [[This will mean destroying ecosystems that are key to
human life, putting at risk millions of people and leading to
irreversible consequences for the environment.]{.underline}]{.mark}

In the face of this greater warmongering, [o[nly the world's working
class and oppressed can offer a progressive
solution]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The growing destruction of the
Arctic, the worsening climate crisis, the exploitation of polluting
resources against the will of the Native peoples surrounding the Arctic
Sea, and direct war between the planet's major powers make it urgent ---
for survival --- that [[we fight to abolish this destructive capitalist
system. We must fight for a socialist society in which workers about our
own future on the planet, in a rational way, as we put an end to
capitalist private ownership]{.underline}.]{.mark}

the collapse of biodiversity and the acceleration of global warming, two
processes that interact in synergy, entail an increasing risk of
extinction for the Homo sapiens. As pointed out by Cristiana Paşca
Palmer, Executive Secretary of the Convention on Biodiversity (2018), "I
hope we aren't the first species to document our own extinction." Julia
Marton-Lefèvre, former Director General of the International Union for
Conservation of Nature (IUCN), reiterates this warning for the umpteenth
time in a statement to delegations meeting at Rio+20 in 2012:

10.1 Defaunation and Biological Annihilation

Rodolfo Dirzo, Mauro Galetti, Ben Collen, and other co-authors of a
review titled "Defaunation in the Anthropocene" (2014) conceptualize one
of the central aspects of the current sixth mass extinction of species:
the term defaunation is used to denote the loss of both species and
populations of wildlife, as well as local declines in abundance of
individuals. The [**[defaunation]{.mark}** process [is in **full
swing**]{.mark}]{.underline}:

> In the past 500 years, [[humans]{.mark} have **[triggered]{.mark}** a
> **wave** of **extinction**, threat, and [local **population

> **rate** and **magnitude** with the **five previous** mass
> extinctions]{.underline} of Earth's history. Similar to other mass
> extinction events, the effects of this "sixth extinction wave" extend
> across taxonomic groups, but they are also selective, with some
> taxonomic groups and regions being particularly affected. (...) So
> profound is this problem that we have applied the term "defaunation"
> to describe it.

In a 2017 article, Gerardo Ceballos, Paul Ehrlich, and, again, Rodolfo
Dirzo warn about the false impression that the threat of biological
annihilation is not imminent:

> [The **strong [focus]{.mark}** [on species
> extinctions]{.mark}]{.underline}, a critical aspect of the

10.2 The 1992 Convention on Biological Biodiversity This process of mass
extinction of plant and animal species has accelerated despite
diplomatic and other efforts. In 1992, 1 day after the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was signed, 194 states2
signed the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). In this robust
30-page document, the signatories solemnly affirm "that the conservation
of biological diversity is a common concern of humankind," declare to be
"concerned that biological diversity is being significantly reduced by
certain human activities," and claim they are "determined to conserve
and sustainably use biological diversity for the benefit of present and
future generations." In contrast to these moving intentions, this is the
reality: while opening the third edition of the UN Global Biodiversity
Outlook (GBO-3) in 2010, Ban Ki-moon, then UN Secretary-General,
highlighted the accelerating decline in biodiversity in the first decade
of the twenty-first century---"the principal pressures leading to
biodiversity loss are not just constant but are, in some cases,
intensifying." This third report was presented at the Nagoya meeting
(COP10) of the Convention on Biological Diversity. In this meeting,
nearly 200 parties subscribed to the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity
(the so-called Aichi Biodiversity Targets), establishing 20 Targets
(subdivided into 56 goals, grouped under 5 strategic goals) for the
conservation of biodiversity between 2011 and 2020, with successive
stages until 2050. After the first 4 years of this first decade, the
fourth edition of the UN Global Biodiversity Outlook (GBO-4), presented
in October 2014 at CBD COP 12 in South Korea, admits that "pressures on
biodiversity will continue to increase at least until 2020, and that the
status of biodiversity will continue to decline."3 With regard to Target
12 (Reducing risk of extinction), the report concludes that: Multiple
lines of evidence give high confidence that based on our current
trajectory, this target would not be met by 2020, as the trend towards
greater extinction risk for several taxonomic groups has not decelerated
since 2010. Despite individual success stories, the average risk of
extinction for birds, mammals, amphibians and corals shows no sign of
decreasing. Using 55 indicator datasets, Derek Tittensor and 50
colleagues (2014) reiterate this same assessment of progress on the
Aichi Targets: "On current trajectories, results suggest that despite
accelerating policy and management responses to the biodiversity crisis,
the impacts of these efforts are unlikely to be reflected in improved
trends in the state of biodiversity by 2020." For Richard Gregory, one
of the authors of this report, "world leaders are currently grappling
with many crises affecting our future. But this study shows there is a
collective failure to address the loss of biodiversity, which is
arguably one of the greatest crises facing humanity" (Vaughan 2014). In
December 2016, the 13th meeting of the CBD in Cancun, Mexico, revealed
the miserable failure of the plans established by signatory countries to
achieve the Aichi Targets by 2020. No less than 90% of these targets,
including halting habitat loss, saving endangered species, reducing
pollution, and making fishing and agriculture more sustainable, was then
expected to be unmet by 2020 (Coghlan 2018). Having failed to honor
their Aichi commitments, countries will meet in October 2020, in
Kunming, China, for the 15th Conference of the Parties (CBD COP15). A
new landmark global pact, titled 2050 CBD Vision "Living in harmony with
nature", is the expected outcome of this meeting. Unfortunately,
according to Friends of the Earth, the draft that will be discussed in
China is not ambitious enough. It fails to recognize the negative
impacts of monoculture agribusiness and pesticides, nor does it call for
divestment from other destructive projects:4 Corporations have a vested
interest in avoiding strict regulation and any attempts to scale down
their profit-driven activities. As long as they have a seat at the
negotiation table, no measures will be taken to live within planetary
boundaries. Yet instead of seeking to reduce corporate conflicts of
interest---a controversial issue in the CBD---the Draft repeatedly
promotes closer collaboration with the private sector, and states that
increased production will be necessary. 10.3 The Biodiversity of the
Holocene There is no unanimity on the number of species that make up
today's biodiversity. In 1988, Robert M. May suggested---on the
assumption that the number of species increased inversely to the
proportion of their size---that there were an estimated 10 million to 50
million terrestrial species. He stressed, however, the uncertainties
about this, especially from a theoretical point of view. In 1996,
Richard Leakey and Roger Lewin considered that the planet hosted perhaps
50 million species. For James P. Collins and Martha L. Crump (2009), the
number of species of organisms living on Earth today would range from 10
million to 100 million, and Richard Monastersky (2014) accepts
estimates---that include animal, plant, and fungal species---oscillating
between 2 million and over 50 million. When it comes to the domain of
microorganisms, which control major nutrient cycles and directly
influence plant, animal, and human health, we enter further into terra
incognita. As Diana R. Nemergut and co-authors (2010) stated in a paper
on bacterial biogeography, "we know relatively little about the forces
shaping their large-scale ecological ranges." Thus, if global
biodiversity quantification estimates include the domains of bacteria
and archaea, our planet could contain nearly one trillion species
(Kenneth and Lennona 2016). That said, at least for eukaryotic species
(organisms whose cells have a nucleus enclosed within membranes), most
estimates have shrunk to less than 10 million species. According to
Nigel E. Stork et al. (2015), there are about 1.5 million beetle species
(estimates ranging from 0.9 to 2.1 million), 5.5 million insect species
(2.6--7.8 million), and 6.8 million species of terrestrial arthropods
(range 5.9--7.8 million), "which suggest that estimates for the world's
insects and their relatives are narrowing considerably." Camilo Mora and
his team (2011) have proposed a new way of estimating the number of
species. According to them: the higher taxonomic classification of
species (i.e., the assignment of species to phylum, class, order,
family, and genus) follows a consistent and predictable pattern from
which the total number of species in a taxonomic group can be estimated.
This approach was validated against well-known taxa, and when applied to
all domains of life, it predicts ∼8.7 million (±1.3 million Standard
Error) eukaryotic species globally, of which ∼2.2 million (±0.18 million
SE) are marine. This study elicited diverse reactions, including
criticism of the methodology used, which would be unable to account for
a global biodiversity. But Sina Adl, one of the co-authors of this work,
is the first to admit that "the estimate in the manuscript is a gross
under-estimate" (as cited in Mathiesen 2013). In any case, a consensus
seems to be outlined regarding the magnitude of global biodiversity, at
least in regard to eukaryotic species. Thus, Rodolfo Dirzo, Mauro
Galetti, and Ben Collen (2014) implicitly consolidate this proposal by
stating: "of a conservatively estimated 5 million to 9 million animal
species on the planet, we are likely losing \~11,000 to 58,000 species
annually." IPBES also works with this scale. As stated by Andy Purvis
(2019), "in the \[Global\] Assessment, we have used a recent mid-low
estimate of 8.1 million animal and plant species, of which an estimated
5.5 million are insects (i.e., 75%) and 2.6 million are not." 10.4 The
Sixth Extinction Species extinction is an inherent fact of evolution;
"some thirty billion species are estimated to have lived since
multicellular creatures first evolved, in the Cambrian explosion"
(Leakey and Lewin 1996), which gives us an idea of their transience,
since the number of multicellular species existing today does not go
beyond the millions, as we have seen. Therefore, at least 99% of all
species that have ever existed are extinct. This is mainly due to the
large mass extinctions of species that abruptly disrupted the increasing
trend of biodiversity. One can speak of mass extinctions when the Earth
loses more than three-quarters of its species in a geologically short
interval (Barnosky et al. 2011). Five major extinctions fall into this
category: (1) in the end of the Ordovician period (440 million years
ago), (2) in the Late Devonian Period (365 million years ago), (3) in
the Permian--Triassic Period (251 million years ago), (4) in the end of
the Triassic Period (210 million years ago), and (5) in the end of the
Cretaceous Period (65 million years ago). Jun-xuan Fan and colleagues
(2010) showed no evidence of a discrete mass extinction near the end of
the Devonian period, the so-called the Late Devonian Frasnian--Famennian
extinction. There was instead "a protracted diversity decline that began
in the Eifelian (392.72 Ma) and continued to \~368.24 Ma with no
subsequent major recovery." The fifth extinction (or the fourth one,
according to this study) opened the Cenozoic Era, generally called the
Age of Mammals, but one that might more appropriately be called the Age
of Arthropods, according to Richard Leakey and Roger Lewin (1996), since
they are the largest phylum in existence, encompassing over 80% of known
animal species. In the late 1970s, a team of researchers led by Luis
Alvarez of the University of California advanced the now widely accepted
hypothesis that the impact of a large asteroid on Mexico's Yucatan
Peninsula (or of an asteroid rain) unleashed or dealt the final blow to
the chain of events known as the fifth extinction. The hypothesis that
external factors also caused other extinctions has gained traction since
1984, when David Raup and Joseph John Sepkoski from the University of
Chicago propounded the occurrence of about 12 extinction events
(including the five largest), with a mean interval between events of 26
million years. The statistical analysis advanced by these scholars leads
to the conclusion that 60% of all extinctions throughout the Phanerozoic
Eon were at least triggered (if not caused) by the impact of asteroids
or comets, which would act as first strikes, making the biotas
vulnerable to other debilitating and destructive processes (Leakey and
Lewin 1996). Whatever may be the current number of existing eukaryotic
species---around eight million now being the most accepted
number---since the 1980s, many scientists have been warning that the
Earth is in the midst of a massive biodiversity extinction crisis caused
by human activities, a process called the sixth extinction. This
threatens to be as or even more annihilating than the previous five,
given three characteristics that are peculiar to it:

\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUME\>\>

(1) [[It is]{.underline}]{.mark} not
    **[[triggered]{.underline}]{.mark}** by an exceptional, external
    event, but [[by]{.mark} a [process **internal** to]{.mark} the
    [biosphere]{.mark}]{.underline}---[the **increasing
    [destructiveness]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} our **global**ized
    **[econ]{.mark}**omic activity]{.underline}---a conscious,
    announced, increasingly well-known, and hitherto unstoppable
    process. The dynamics of the sixth extinction is not like the
    irradiation of waves caused by the impact of a stone on the surface
    of water, which tends to wane as its range extends into space and
    time; [it is a **process** that is **[intensified]{.mark}** in
    **direct relation** to the expansion of the **commodity
    market**]{.underline}, especially after 1950 and [in the [ensuing
    **wave** of **capitalism's extreme** globalization, causing
    **pollution**, **degradation**, and **destruction**]{.mark} of
    non-anthropized **habitats**]{.underline}. Figure 10.1 [clearly
    shows the **brutal acceleration** of species
    extinctions]{.underline} from the 1980s onward, closely related to
    increase in human population, following the degradation of natural
    habitats by the expansion of global agribusiness and other economic
    activities.

(2) The second characteristic is that, far from implying the dominance
    of one taxonomic group over the others, [the sixth extinction
    [endangers]{.mark} the]{.underline} allegedly
    ["**[dominant]{.mark}**" [species by **destroying**]{.mark} the
    [**web** of]{.mark} **biological [sustenance]{.mark}**]{.underline}
    that allows it to exist (Jones 2011). We will return to this point
    in the last chapter as we analyze the illusions of anthropocentrism,
    but it is clear that the web of life that sustains our global
    society and, ultimately, our species is becoming weaker and weaker,
    as a multitude of scientists and diplomats never cease to repeat. In
    2011, prefacing the Global Biodiversity Outlook 3 report, Achim
    Steiner, former Executive Director of the UNEP (2006--2016), warned
    of this compelling fact: "The arrogance of humanity is that somehow
    we imagine we can get by without biodiversity or that it is somehow
    peripheral: the truth is we need it more than ever on a planet of
    six billion heading to over nine billion people by 2050."

(3) The third characteristic of the sixth extinction is its overwhelming
    speed. The current rate of extinction is speeding up. As pointed out
    by Andy Purvis (2019), "while it is true that the very highest rate
    of confirmed extinctions was in the late 19th century, as flightless
    island birds fell prey to cats and rats introduced by Europeans, the
    rate was as high again by the end of the 20th century." And over the
    past two decades, it has accelerated even further. Speed is perhaps
    the most important feature of the sixth extinction because this
    almost sudden characteristic suppresses a crucial evolutionary
    variable: the time it takes for species to adapt to and survive
    environmental changes. Based on extrapolations from a sample of 200
    snail species, Claire Régnier and colleagues (2015) showed that we
    may have already lost 7% of the previously described nonmarine
    animal species. In other words, 130,000 of these nonmarine species
    may have been lost forever since their taxonomic record (see also
    Pearce 2015). Unlike the previous ones, [the sixth extinction is not
    **measurable** on a **geological scale**, but on a **historical
    scale**]{.underline}, and the unit of time by which this scale is
    measured is shortening. In 1900, it occurred on the scale of
    centuries. Fifty years ago, the most appropriate observation scale
    would be the decade. Today, the unit of measurement for the
    advancement of the sixth extinction is the year or even the day. In
    June 2010, UNEP's The State of the Planet's Biodiversity document
    estimated that 150 to 200 species become extinct every 24 hours.
    This speed of the sixth extinction---I must repeat---cannot be
    compared to the previous five mass extinctions. More than 20 years
    ago, Peter M. Vitousek et al. (1997), reporting on then-recent
    calculations, stated that "[rates of species extinction are now on
    the **order** of 100 to **1000 times** those before humanity's
    **dominance** of Earth]{.underline}." According to a global survey
    of plant extinctions, "since 1900, nearly 3 species of seed-bearing
    plants have disappeared per year, which is up to 500 times faster
    than they would naturally" (Ledford 2019). In 2005, the Ecosystems
    and Human Well-being: Synthesis (2005), a report established by the
    Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, stated:

> The rate of known extinctions of species in the past century is
> roughly 50--500 times greater than the extinction rate calculated from
> the fossil record of 0.1--1 extinctions per 1,000 species per
> 1,000 years. The rate is up to 1,000 times higher than the background
> extinction rates if possibly extinct species are included.

And the same document estimates that "[[projected **future extinction**
rate is]{.mark} more than **[ten times higher]{.mark}** than current
rate]{.underline}." In line with this projection, Chris Thomas et al.
(2004) "predict, on the basis of mid-range climate-warming scenarios for
2050, that 15--37% of species in our sample of regions and taxa will be
committed to extinction."

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

10.5 The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species The number species
threatened with extinction has grown rapidly over the past 50 years, as
the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) records show.
Today, this assessment divides species into nine categories: Not
Evaluated, Data Deficient, Least Concern, Near Threatened, Vulnerable,
Endangered, Critically Endangered, Extinct in the Wild, and Extinct. In
1964, the first IUCN's Red List of Threatened Species was published,
which periodically lists the species evaluated as Critically Endangered,
Endangered, or Vulnerable.5 Table 10.1 gives us an idea of the speed of
the process of species extinction that is underway. To date, more than
105,700 species have been assessed for the IUCN Red List, and more than
28,000 species are threatened with extinction (27%). Between 2000 and
2013, with the increase in the number of species evaluated having
quadrupled, the number of threatened species nearly doubled, from just
over 10,000 in 2000 to 21,286 in 2013, as shown in Fig. 10.2. Table 10.2
gives a picture of the evolution of the relationship between the
evaluated species and those threatened with extinction over the last 10
years. In the 2015 assessment, 14 species were shifted from the
"Endangered" category to the "Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct)"
category. 10.6 The Living Planet Index (LPI) and the Decline in
Terrestrial Vertebrate Populations In the important 2017 study, quoted
at the beginning of this chapter, Gerardo Ceballos, Paul Ehrlich, and
Rodolfo Dirzo emphasize the global extent and speed of the recent
decline in vertebrates: Considering all land vertebrates, our spatially
explicit analyses indicate a massive pulse of population losses, with a
global epidemic of species declines. Those analyses support the view
that the decay of vertebrate animal life is widespread geographically,
crosses phylogenetic lineages, and involves species ranging in abundance
from common to rare. (...) In the last few decades, habitat loss,
overexploitation, invasive organisms, pollution, toxification, and more
recently climate disruption, as well as the interactions among these
factors, have led to the catastrophic declines in both the numbers and
sizes of populations of both common and rare vertebrate species. For
example, several species of mammals that were relatively safe one or two
decades ago are now endangered. In this paper, the authors' objective
differs from that of the IUCN, which is mainly concerned with risks of
extinction and, therefore, with species whose populations are already
scarce or rare and that have less territorial distribution. Unlike the
IUCN, the three authors cited here also take into account the decline in
"common" or abundant species. Thus, they propose a picture of the
present process of "biological annihilation" of terrestrial vertebrates,
perhaps even more dramatic than the one proposed by the IUCN's Red List.
Starting from the IUCN assessments, they divide this picture into two
large groups. On one side, there are the species placed by the IUCN
under the category "Low Concern" or "Data Deficient." On the other side,
there are the "Threatened Species," according to their various threat
levels ("Critically Endangered," "Endangered," "Vulnerable," and "Near
Threatened"). The result is captured in Fig. 10.3. The first column
(Land vertebrates), which summarizes the four successive ones (mammals,
birds, reptiles, and amphibians), shows that populations of about two
thirds of terrestrial vertebrates are in decline; "this figure
emphasizes," the authors conclude, "that even species that have not yet
been classified as endangered (roughly 30% in the case of all
vertebrates) are declining. This situation is exacerbated in the case of
birds, for which close to 55% of the decreasing species are still
classified as 'low concern.'" This evaluation converges with the Living
Planet Report 2018 (twelfth edition) of the Living Planet Index
(WWF/ZSL), which measured the state of 16,704 populations of 4005
species. The results are frightening; on average, vertebrate animal
populations in 2014 were well under half their 1970 levels. Between 1970
and 2014, 60% of worldwide vertebrate animal populations had been wiped
out. In freshwater habitats, populations have collapsed by 83%, and in
South and Central America, the worst affected region, there has been an
89% total drop in vertebrate animal populations. The key drivers of
biodiversity decline, and the primary threats to these populations
remain overexploitation (37%), habitat degradation (31.4%), and habitat
loss (13.4%). As stressed by the authors of the Living Planet Report
2018, "of all the plant, amphibian, reptile, bird and mammal species
that have gone extinct since AD 1500, 75% were harmed by
overexploitation or agricultural activity or both." 10.7 The Two
Extinction Pathways

\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUME\>\>

Global [**capitalism tears** the **web** of **life**]{.underline} in two
complementary ways: as a direct and immediate consequence of its
activities---legal or illegal---and as a reflexive and systemic mode of
impact on habitats. In deforestation, timber trade, hunting, fishing,
and trafficking of wild species, especially in the tropical world and in
particular in Brazil, legal activity which is profoundly destructive
conceals illegality and is inextricably intertwined with it. In June
2014, a joint report from UNEP and Interpol looked at illegal wildlife
trafficking, assessing the magnitude of the monetary values involved
(Nellemann 2009):

#### Capitalism limits pandemic response

It is tempting to see pandemics as unpredictable, cataclysmic incursions
of nature into human society.1 Yet the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease
2019 (Covid-19) is anything but a "natural" phenomenon. Epidemics and
pandemics happen in a social, political and economic context, which
interweaves with processes such as the mutation of viruses, their
passage from one host to another and their impact on living organisms.
The nature of the Covid-19 pandemic cannot therefore be grasped without
considering capitalism in its current configuration.

Above all, [a pandemic on this scale intensifies the pre-existing fault
lines of capitalism]{.underline}. At the most basic level [it poses a
choice: defend profits or save lives]{.underline}. The indications, thus
far, are that **[the former has been the overriding
priority]{.underline}** for those presiding over the system. This
article explores how pandemics enmesh with the logic of capital and
offers some potential responses from the left.

#### Capitalism is a key factor in the spread of diseases

**Choonara '20** \[Joseph; March 22; editor of International Socialism
and author;  International Socialism; "Socialism in a time of
pandemics"; <https://isj.org.uk/socialism-in-a-time-of-pandemics/>\]

By this time Europe was itself experiencing profound social
transformation. [With the development of industrial
capitalism]{.underline}, which took off in Britain from the 18th
century, [came]{.underline} accelerated urbanisation. This created
squalid conditions in the new towns and cities, with [large numbers of
people packed into slums with miserable sanitation. Poverty, stress and
overcrowding increased susceptibility to disease and ensured that once
diseases were introduced they would spread rapidly]{.underline}.
Moreover, once diseases arrived in a city, they could be passed through
growing networks of trade, movements of people for work, to wage war or
administer colonies, or to escape war, poverty or repression.21 Indeed,
in this period, through to the 19th century---when nutrition, sewerage,
hygiene and public healthcare began to improve---[people]{.underline} in
British towns and cities [tended to die younger]{.underline} than those
in the countryside. London in particular was a "devourer" of people,
with more burials than baptism for much of the 18th century, "largely a
result of 'crowd diseases' such as smallpox, measles and
tuberculosis".22

#### Capitalist systems mean only the rich survive 

Paz '23 \[Cecilia; August 13; Author for liberation; Liberation; "Four
sneaky ways capitalist health care kills poor people";
https://liberationnews.org/four-sneaky-ways-capitalist-healthcare-kills-poor-people/\]

[[It is common knowledge that **health care under capitalism is only
guaranteed to those who can afford it.**]{.mark}]{.underline} Policies
like universal health care have increased in popularity in recent years,
yet the United States is still the only high-income nation without a
nationalized health care system. The health-wealth gap is also blatant
in the United States --- [[low-income people are five times more likely
to be in poor health than the wealthy, and have life expectancies that
are up to 15 years shorter]{.underline}]{.mark}. Poor people are at
higher risk for chronic illnesses and other poor health outcomes, yet
they have the most difficulty accessing medical care. In short,
capitalism makes us sick and then denies us the right to get better. In
addition to its more transparent anti-poor practices, the [[for-profit
capitalist health care system also uses deceptive workarounds to deny
life-saving medical care even to individuals who are supposed to be
covered under Medicaid and other government health insurance
programs]{.underline}]{.mark}. Here are [[four]{.underline}]{.mark}
sneaky [[ways]{.underline}]{.mark} capitalist health care kills poor
people. 

[[Administrative burdens]{.underline}]{.mark}

Administrative burdens are the tasks that create a gap between the care
doctors want to give and the care patients receive --- paperwork, wait
times, insurance procedures and more. They are created by insurance
companies, pharmaceutical companies, lack of government oversight and
profit-seeking hospitals. In an essay published in the New York Times,
maternal-fetal medicine physician Dr. Chavi Karkowsky writes that her
"average Wednesday" involves seeing several patients who are unable to
access necessary supplies or medications because of administrative
burdens. She blames medical bureaucracy for the issue: The unpaid labor
patients and doctors must take on in order to access medical care is
increasing because insurers and hospitals prioritize reducing costs over
patient treatment. The poorest working-class patients --- those working
low-wage jobs, those who do not speak English, and those who must fight
to stay on Medicaid --- are most impacted by administrative burden.
Without paid time off or child care, working-class people don't have
days or hours to spend on administrative burdens, and the wait time can
cost them their lives.

[[Medicaid denials]{.underline}]{.mark}

Many people in the United States rely on the federal Medicaid program to
access the care that they need, but this program baselessly denies
coverage to working-class people at increasing rates. Since 1965,
Medicaid has provided health insurance coverage to certain low-income
Americans. Powerful lobbying organizations like the American Medical
Association have historically opposed all government provision of health
care, and this program was only made possible by mobilizations of Black
doctors, civil rights and feminist movement leaders and grassroots
organizations, which fought to secure health care for poor people.
However, Medicaid falls short of activists' demands for universal health
coverage. More recently, as president, Barack Obama campaigned on health
care reform, leading to the Affordable Care Act, which expanded Medicaid
access but still left millions uninsured. 

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, 3.8 million people have
lost Medicaid coverage for reasons unrelated to their eligibility, and
this is an underestimate because only 38 states make the information
available. Of these, three quarters of patients lost coverage because of
administrative burdens. Barriers to renewing plans include state
mistakes like mailing notices to the wrong address, failing to mail
notices altogether and insisting that the patient submit different
paperwork. Paperwork is often confusing and time consuming, leading
Medicaid recipients to submit it late and have their care delayed or
removed as a result. 

While the federal government provides most of the funding for Medicaid,
individual states are responsible for setting standards and handling
renewals, and oversight is notoriously lacking. The federal government
mandates that states automatically renew people's coverage using
electronic data like wage records from food stamps and other benefits
programs, but most states still require burdensome yearly renewals. As
of July, 12 states violated this mandate. For example, in Florida alone,
200,000 people lost Medicaid coverage this year for procedural reasons,
but the state refuses to collaborate with the federal government to
minimize removals. The federal government has done little to remedy
these injustices.

The most desperate people in the poorest states are the most affected by
cutoffs --- take West Virginia, where one third of residents rely on
Medicaid. There, clinics have been forced to reject people when they
show up for their appointments having unknowingly become uninsured. At
just one clinic, the Charleston West Virginia Health Clinic, 1,600
patients lost coverage between May and July. Heather Elkins is a patient
in West Virginia who had to leave the workforce because she suffers from
several chronic health conditions including lung disease, which was
partly caused by breathing lime dust at her former construction job.
Earlier this year when she tried to pick up her prescriptions, Elkins
found out she had been kicked off of Medicaid, and was unable to access
medication to treat her chronic obstructive pulmonary lung disease. She
never received notice of the cutoff. Two months later she was back on
Medicaid, but it is criminal that health care be denied healthcare for
any period of time. 

[[Capitalism makes us sick and denies us the right to get
better.]{.underline}]{.mark} At a moment's notice, patients can lose
access to life-saving medications. In the richest country in the world,
the government chooses to spend billions of dollars every year on
projects that do not serve working-class people like funding the
military machine, but fails to follow through on their promise of
providing health care to Medicaid patients. 

[[Denials by private insurance companies]{.underline}]{.mark}

Patients who do manage to access Medicaid still face denials from
insurance companies. Three quarters of Medicaid patients recieve care
through private insurance companies, which are paid a fixed amount per
patient by the federal government. Other subscribers pay for every
individual visit, drug, and procedure, so insurance companies make less
money when insuring Medicaid patients. This gives the companies an
incentive to deny Medicaid patients coverage because to them profit is
more important than human lives. It is typical for for-profit insurance
companies to deny care to Medicaid patients at rates up to 25%. Elevance
has denial rates of up to 34% and Molina has denial rates reaching 41%
in some states. Some insurers claim that they only deny procedures that
are not medically necessary, but this claim was disproved in a 2022
federal report, which found that insurers deny thousands of
authorization requests for necessary procedures every year. Insurance
company denials create yet another administrative barrier for
working-class people, many of whom don't have time to wait for insurers
to approve their care. When the state fails to intervene, patients who
are denied coverage choose between medical debt and ongoing illness or
even death.

[[Hospital greed and understaffing]{.underline}]{.mark}

Like insurance companies, hospitals in the United States also create
barriers to patient care. Hospitals deliberately understaff themselves
to make more money, which creates increased wait times and leaves
doctors with less time to spend with each patient. A longer wait time in
the emergency room can be the difference between life and death for a
patient, and shorter check-ups can lead physicians to overlook
life-threatening health issues. Understaffing also increases
administrative burdens on both patients and doctors.

In many areas, the only medical care available is at a for-profit
hospital, meaning that for many working-class people, health care is out
of reach. So-called "non-profit" hospitals receive significant tax
breaks by promising to provide charity health care to patients in need.
However, many "non-profit" hospitals have recently come under fire for
illegally charging low-income people for their procedures, leaving
patients in medical debt while they reap billions of dollars in profits.
These hospitals use the tax incentives designed to promote health care
access for poor people, and then screw those patients over to increase
their profits.

Physicians are increasingly dissatisfied with the cruelty of our
hospitals and insurance companies. In 2021, 117,000 physicians left the
workforce, many of them citing burnout, while fewer than 40,000 joined
it. Nearly two-thirds of physicians report burnout, which is attributed
to the demoralization that comes with repeatedly being unable to provide
patients with the care they need under the for-profit health care
system. Doctors like Dr. Eric Reinhart, a physician at Northwestern
University, have pivoted towards political mobilization to oppose the
unjust capitalist health care system, calling for the reorganization of
U.S. medical care towards prioritizing patient care over profits. 

[[The common thread]{.underline}]{.mark} connecting health care access
barriers like Medicaid denials, private insurance company denials, and
hospital greed and understaffing [[is that capitalist health care
prioritizes profit over working-class people's lives]{.underline}. [Tens
of thousands of preventable deaths occur every year because people
cannot afford health care]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} No one
should have to choose between being sick or dying and going into medical
debt. [[We need to eliminate private insurance companies, pharmaceutical
companies and other exploitative corporations, and redirect their
profits towards providing health care for all. **This is impossible
under capitalism. A socialist system would make health care a human
right**]{.underline}]{.mark}. As we saw with the fight for Medicare and
Medicaid, [[only by organizing for change can we achieve a just health
care system. We need socialism]{.underline}]{.mark} --- our lives depend
on it!

---Eric Holt-Giménez1

In March, [[Cal-Maine Foods]{.mark}, the largest U.S. egg producer,
[report]{.mark}ed that [chickens]{.mark} in one of its Texas egg
factories had [contracted]{.mark} Highly Pathogenic Avian [Influenza
Type A]{.mark}--better known as Bird Flu. To stop the disease from
spreading, the corporation slaughtered 1.6 million birds. This was just
[the latest mass cull]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [the current Bird Flu]{.mark}
epidemic--[over 100 million f]{.mark}armed birds and countless wild ones
across the U.S. and Canada have [died]{.mark} since the beginning of
2022.2]{.underline}

Across the U.S., Cal-Maine operates 42 "production facilities" in which
44 million hens lay over 13 billion eggs a year. In 2023 it had gross
profits of \$1.2 billion on \$3.1 billion in sales.3 In that context,
the loss of 1.6 million birds in Texas is a minor
inconvenience--especially since the U.S. government (responding to
agribusiness lobbying) pays for birds slaughtered in Bird Flu outbreaks.
Millions of dead chickens are a cost of doing business, and not a major
one, at that.

[[Influenza viruses]{.mark} have been [carried by waterfowl]{.mark} for
centuries without making the birds ill, but when a variant dubbed
[H5N1]{.mark} jumped to farmed ducks in southern China in 1996, it
rapidly [evolved into a form]{.mark} [that is both **highly infectious
and deadly**]{.mark} for poultry.]{.underline} That version subsequently
jumped back to wild birds, and has continued to mutate while spreading
worldwide. The disease primarily affects poultry, but between 2003 and
2019, 861 human cases were reported in 17 countries, and 455 of the
patients died.4

[[An influenza variant]{.mark} that first appeared in pigs in the United
States and Mexico in 2009 [went on to infect]{.mark} [millions]{.mark}
of people worldwide, [killing]{.mark} between 150,000 and
[575,000]{.mark} people.]{.underline}

Since the late 1990s, [a new and highly pathogenic variant of H5N1 has
become the principal cause of Avian Influenza in Europe, Africa, Asia,
and North America, responsible for millions of poultry deaths. In April
2024,]{.underline} the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that for
the first time it had infected dairy cattle. On May 8, the CDC reported
that 36 dairy herds in 9 states were affected by H5N1, but that is
certainly an underestimate, since many operators are refusing to test
cattle or report infections.

[A dairy worker in Texas is [the first-known example of mammal-to-human
H5N1 transmission]{.mark}, but again, other cases may not have been
reported]{.underline}, particularly since the human symptoms of this flu
are mild and short-lived. The risk to human health is currently said to
be low, but as epidemiologist Michael Mina points out,

[[unchecked transmission]{.mark} among cattle [means the virus
is]{.mark} increasingly [bumping up against humans]{.mark}. Every human
exposure, in turn, provides an opportunity for new mutations that could
enable human-to-human transmission]{.underline}... Though the risk of an
H5N1 pandemic may currently be low, the consequences of inaction could
be catastrophic.5

Flu Factories

Until the third quarter of the 20th Century, a Bird Flu virus that
jumped to a domestic chicken or pig would have quickly hit a dead end.
Almost all chickens were raised on family farms in flocks of a few dozen
birds: 400 was a very large flock. Pigs were kept in much smaller
numbers. So even if the virus was highly contagious, it would soon run
out of new hosts to infect..

[That changed with what has been called "**[the most profound alteration
of the animal-human relationship in 10,000
years]{.mark}**]{.underline}"6--- the rapid expansion of Concentrated
Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs), **[[more accurately called factory
farms.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Today [[a handful of giant corporations]{.mark} [control
production]{.mark} of broilers]{.underline} (chickens raised for meat)
and layers (chickens kept for eggs). A typical facility has hundreds of
thousands of birds crammed into windowless buildings with little room to
move. By the end of the 20th century, the poultry industry in North
America was completely transformed, and its methods were widely copied,
particularly in southeast Asia and China.

Hog-farming was transformed even more rapidly, beginning in the 1990s.

[In 1992 less than a third of U.S. hogs were raised on farms with more
than two thousand animals, but [by]{.mark} [2004 four out of five hogs
came from]{.mark} [one]{.mark} of these giant [operations]{.mark}, and
**[by 2007, 95 percent]{.mark}** were.]{.underline} An analysis by Food
& Water Watch found that between 1997 and 2007, 4,600 hogs were added to
a factory farm every single day, increasing the total to more than 62
million.7

Worldwide, three-quarters of all cows, chickens, pigs, and sheep are
kept in confined industrial facilities. In the United States, the
factory farmed proportion is much higher, including over 99% of chickens
and 98%% of pigs.

[The birds and [animals]{.mark} in these industrial systems have been
[bred to grow rapidly]{.mark}, producing consistent amounts of meat or
eggs while consuming a minimum of feed.]{.underline} Through
profit-focused breeding programs, commercial poultry has lost more than
half of the generic diversity of their wild ancestors.8 [Factory
[farms]{.mark} are [populated by genetically-identical animal]{.mark}s
that respond similarly to new infections--a virus that makes one animal
ill can do the same to the others without further
mutations.]{.underline} If one chicken in a mega-barn contracts avian
flu, most of the rest will die in a few days.

[[If you wanted to build a pandemic-creation machine, you could scarcely
improve on the factory farm system]{.mark}.]{.underline} As Rob Wallace
writes.

[Our world is encircled by cities of millions of monoculture pig and
poultry pressed alongside each other, an ecology nigh perfect for the
evolution of multiple virulent strains of influenza.]{.underline}9

However unintended, [the [entirety of]{.mark} the [production]{.mark}
line [is organized around practices that accelerate]{.mark} the
evolution of **[pathogen virulence]{.mark}** and subsequent
transmission.]{.underline} Growing genetic monocultures--food animals
and plants with nearly identical genomes--removes immune firebreaks that
in more diverse populations slow down transmission. [[Pathogens]{.mark}
now can just [quickly evolve]{.mark} around the commonplace host immune
genotypes.]{.underline} Meanwhile, crowded conditions depress immune
response. Larger farm animal population sizes and densities of factory
farms facilitate greater transmission and recurrent infection. [High
throughput, a part of any industrial production, provides a continually
renewed supply of susceptibles at barn, farm, and regional levels,
removing the cap on the evolution of pathogen deadliness.]{.underline}
Housing a lot of animals together rewards those strains that can burn
through them best. Decreasing the age of slaughter--to six weeks in
chickens--is likely to select for pathogens able to survive more robust
immune systems.10

Similarly, a multi-disciplinary task force sponsored by the non-profit
Council for Agricultural Science and Technology concluded:

[A major impact of modern intensive production systems is that they
allow the rapid selection and amplification of pathogens that arise from
a virulent ancestor (frequently by subtle mutation), thus there is
increasing risk for disease entrance and/or dissemination... Stated
simply, because of the Livestock Revolution, global risks of disease are
increasing.]{.underline}11

[[The accelerating emergence of zoonotic diseases is **inextricably
connected** to]{.mark} the [industrialization]{.mark} of poultry, pigs
and cattle, which itself is inextricably bound up with capital's drive
to expand, no matter what damage it does]{.underline}. Annual profits of
\$4.9 billion (Cargill), \$4.4 billion (JBS Foods), and \$4.1 billion
(Tyson Foods),12 are only possible because they offload the costs of
pandemics and pollution onto society at large[. So long as factory farms
generate such returns, [agribusiness will]{.mark} continue to
[treat]{.mark} epidemic [disease as]{.mark} an [acceptable]{.mark} cost
of doing business.]{.underline}

Agribusiness, as Rob Wallace puts it, is in a strategic alliance with
influenza. Big Food is at war with public health, and public health is
losing.13

[Donald Trump has unleashed a trade war that threatens to tank the
global economy. His zigzags on tariffs have caused [economists]{.mark}
to [repeatedly adjust their projections]{.mark} of whether we'll see a
recession this year.]{.underline}

But recessions are always officially declared after they have begun. By
some estimates the US is already in a recession. The US economy
contracted by 0.3% in the first quarter of 2025. Retail spending has
weakened. Tariffs have not yet caused a jump in inflation, largely
because U.S. companies stocked up on foreign products before the tariffs
kicked in. But once those stockpiles run out, prices will rise[. The
[**anticipation of rising prices** caused]{.mark} US [consumer
sentiment]{.mark} to drop in April to the second-lowest level ever
recorded, [worse than]{.mark} during [the Great Recession]{.mark} or the
pandemic-triggered recession of 2020.]{.underline}

Even if [[the U.S]{.mark}.]{.underline} manages to evade a recession in

of]{.mark} slow economic growth and rising inflation. This could result
in [stagflation]{.mark}, which would mean a period of high unemployment,
high prices, and increasingly difficult to control inflation. Slow
growth and recession in the US will drag down the global
economy.]{.underline}

of]{.mark} expanded [production]{.mark}, [overaccumulation]{.mark} of
capital, [econ]{.mark}omic **[crisis, and
depression]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Under capitalism, [production is unplanned and driven by the search for
profits, not the needs of society. The logic of [cap]{.mark}italism
[requires constant growth]{.mark}: businesses must compete with one
another for greater control of markets [and greater]{.mark} profit
[margins]{.mark} or they will be gobbled up by their
competitors.]{.underline} Yet there is no guarantee that the goods
produced will be profitably sold because production does not take
society's needs into account.

During a boom, [[when]{.mark} the [econ]{.mark}omy is [growing]{.mark}
and capitalists are expanding production, businesses' [demand
for]{.mark} machinery, technology, and raw **[materials]{.mark} tends to
[outpace supply]{.mark}**. Lower unemployment leads to increased
consumer demand as well.]{.underline} The growth of demand drives an
expansion of production and thereby bigger profits. The promise of
increased profits then attracts more investment, often leading to wild
speculation and the creation of market bubbles.

[[Profits come from exploiting labor]{.mark}, not shrewd business
tactics.]{.underline} There are limitations on demand under an economic
system where bosses pay workers less than the real value of their labor
and constantly attempt to drive down wages. [[When demand slows]{.mark}
and [the]{.mark} [market reaches]{.mark} a [saturation]{.mark} point,
expansion of an industry hits a wall. [Businesses are slow to
correct]{.mark} for their [overproduction]{.mark} because they look at
current prices and profits to determine future production, lagging far
behind actual supply and demand. [This]{.mark} can [lead to steep
drops]{.mark} in prices, with businesses selling at a loss. The boom
turns into a bust.]{.underline}

What the socialist economist Karl Marx called overaccumulation of
capital takes place when capitalists can't find avenues to productively
invest their profits. [[Production is reduced once profits dry
up]{.mark}, and factories may run below capacity or stop running
completely. The capital (buildings, machinery, land, etc.) that
capitalists own ceases to be capital if it's not being
used.]{.underline} Factories transform from profit-generators into
little more than piles of bricks. Profits can also be squeezed by
capitalism's tendency to increase investment in labor-saving technology
thereby pushing out workers, the source of profits, from production.

[**[A slump]{.mark} can [easily spread]{.mark}** from one industry to
another and drag [down the wider economy]{.mark}. For example, if the
housing market is oversaturated, construction companies will stop
investing in new projects,]{.underline} regardless of whether or not
people need shelter. As development sites lay motionless, demand for
lumber, machinery, and other materials plummets. Workers in affected
industries may be laid off, which leads to lower demand for many goods.

When productive investment is not an option[, [capitalists]{.mark} have
increasingly [funnel]{.mark}ed [billions into]{.mark} risky financial
instruments, [repackaging debts]{.mark} and credit into commodities to
buy and sell. We saw this reach a fever pitch during the subprime
mortgage crisis which triggered the Great Recession of
2007--9.]{.underline} This artificially extended the housing boom,
provoking an even greater collapse of the world economy.

[A [recession restores profitability]{.mark} through the destruction of
capital and a clearing of the playing field, **[with disastrous
consequences]{.mark}** for the working class.]{.underline} The
capitalist class always tries to pass the burden onto the working class,
like we saw in 2008--9: bailouts for the bankers, foreclosures and
layoffs for working people. [For the capitalists that make it through
the gauntlet of bankruptcies and plant closures, economic crises
eventually give way to a new round of expansion. They buy up their
failed competitors, sweep up factories and land at steep discounts, and
find it easier to force lower wages onto workers due to higher
unemployment.]{.underline}

There's No "Final Crisis" for Capitalism

The manner in which capitalist crises are resolved merely lays the basis
for the next crisis. The system's contradictions and instability tends
to deepen over time. For example, personal credit offers a way for
capitalists to increase their profits by paying workers less and
obliging them to take on massive consumer debt---US credit card debt
reached an all-time high in February, with average household credit card
debt standing at nearly \$9,000. The problem of excessive debt first
emerged during the 1973--1975 recession, with government, business, and
consumer debt ballooning worldwide during the [economic crises that
followed.]{.underline}

[[**Unsustainable** debt]{.mark} levels, inter-**[imperialist
rivalry]{.mark}**, **[protectionist trade]{.mark}** policies,
**[military conflicts]{.mark},** and [climate]{.mark} change all [make
cap]{.mark}italism increasingly **[crisis-prone]{.mark}**
today.]{.underline} The coming world recession could be as severe or
more severe than 2008. The underlying causes of the Great Recession have
only since been exacerbated. And unlike in 2008, today there's no single
dominant world power capable of leading a global economic recovery.
Instead, the world economy is being destabilized by a power struggle
between the two major imperialist powers, China and the US.

[[After a recession]{.mark}, the start of a new cycle of **[capitalist
production can]{.mark} momentarily [address]{.mark} the system's
[contradictions]{.mark},**]{.underline} but it cannot fundamentally
resolve them. Lurching from one crisis to the next does long-term damage
to the system which neither the capitalists nor their corporate parties
can repair. The only way to break out of this downward spiral is to
change the system entirely.

Economic crises wreak havoc on the working class, but they also expose
the limitations of the existing system and can unleash struggles against
it. The '08 crisis created a stunning effect as the working class dealt
with the fallout of the recession, but in 2011 protests emerged in the
U.S. in the form of Occupy Wall Street. Those protests, along with the
revolutionary events in the Middle East, North Africa, and the massive
protests and general strikes in Southern Europe, kicked off a decade
chock-full of struggles against attempts to place the burden of the
crisis onto the working class.

[This time around, we should expect less of a stunning effect and
potentially even more explosive anger from the working
class.]{.underline} The memory of the Great Recession left a deep
imprint on consciousness, defining the Millennial generation. [New
generations of [workers]{.mark} and youth are [face]{.mark}d with an
even worse [econ]{.mark}omic [outlook]{.mark}, saddled with rising
inflation and debt levels.]{.underline} To reverse the skyrocketing cost
of living that promises to worsen with a new recession[,
**[workers]{.mark} worldwide [need to break]{.mark} out of
[cap]{.mark}italism's [cycle of crisis by]{.mark} overthrowing this
profit-driven system once and for all, [replacing it with a]{.mark}
democratically-planned global [socialist economy]{.mark}** dictated by
human need.]{.underline}

Financial crisis broadly refers to disruptions in financial markets
causing constraint to the flow of credit to families and businesses and
consequently having adverse effect on the real economy of goods and
services. The term is generally used to describe a variety of situations
in which investors unexpectedly lose substantial amount of their
investments, and financial institutions suddenly lose significant
proportion of their value. Financial crises include, among others, stock
market crashes, financial bubbles, currency crises, and sovereign
defaults.

Causes and consequences of financial crisis financial bubbles are
generally linked to easy credit, excessive debt, speculation, greed,
fraud, and corruption. Easy credit leads to lack of adequate market
discipline, which in turn instigates excessive and imprudent lending.
Are all these things the consequences of capitalism, where the profit
from the interest rate and debt is the most wanted?

Karl Marx has often been presented as a relic of the 19th century, whose
outdated ideas say little of relevance to the modern world. [That belief
was shattered [with the 2008]{.mark} global financial [crisis]{.mark},
when many of **[Marx\'s key ideas were vindicated]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[The 2008 Financial Crisis saw the global economy come close to a
collapse in a matter of months. Millions lost their jobs.]{.underline}
Overnight, families lost their homes, savings and livelihoods with
nothing to fall back on. How could a crisis of this extent take place so
unexpectedly? Enter: the man with nineteenth century Germany\'s most
impressive beard: Karl Marx.

Considered one of history\'s most influential, revoluntionary, and
controversional [thinkers, Marx\'s major work was his critique of
Capitalism. This critique spanned at least three books, five (extended)
esssays, and several articles. It was Marx\'s belief that the
**[contradictions and tensions inherent in Cap]{.mark}italism [made
crashes]{.mark} (like the one in 2008) [an
inevitability]{.mark},**]{.underline} and that these [tensions were
ultimately that would lead to its demise through revolution]{.underline}
(another inevitability, according to Marx). How did he come to such
conclusions? Can this theory, born in the 1860s, really help to explain
events like the Global Financial Crisis?

One of the most compelling features of Marxist thought is the breadth of
disciplines that it draws from in its attempt to understand[. Marx
explored how [economics, ethics and]{.mark} social [ideology are
weaponised]{.mark} by the elite in order [to seize]{.mark} and maintain
[power]{.mark}. Marx maintains that any systems of politics, morality or
ideology (what he terms the superstructure of a society) ultimately stem
from the given system of production present in society (the
substructure).]{.underline}

\"\... my view that each special mode of production and the social
relations corresponding to it, in short, that the economic structure of
society, is the real basis on which the juridical and political
superstructure is raised and to which social forms of thought
correspond; that the mode of production determines the character of the
social, political, and intellectual life generally \...\"

Marx believed that [material conditions, and the processes used to
achieve such conditions (in other words, the distribution of goods and
services) are ultimately what create the social structures and power
dynamics of a given community. The 2008 global financial crisis and its
aftermath laid bare these dynamics, and that if Marx had been there to
see it, he would have had a field day \... or possibly an
aneurysm.]{.underline}

Looking back on the decade leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, we
can plainly see a number of the flaws that Marx identified with
capitalism in action.

It is widely agreed that a [[central cau]{.mark}se of the crisis
[was]{.mark} practice of **[subprime mortgage lending]{.mark}**. This
involved [banks]{.mark} and other financial institutions [offering
loans]{.mark}, typically [to individuals with poor credit]{.mark}
[histories]{.mark}, based on an adjustable-rate mortgage.]{.underline}
In practice, this meant banks were able to offer initially low,
attractive interest rates to sign people on[, [but were soon]{.mark}
after [able to increase]{.mark} these [rates]{.mark} significantly,
which [they justified]{.mark} due to the increased risk taken on by
providing loans to those with poorer cred]{.underline}it. This approach
to economics, in which investment is increasingly diverted to
speculative financial products, [rather than reinvested into the means
of production (what we would now label
**[\'Financialization\']{.mark})**,]{.underline} is something that Marx
describes in terms of \'Fictitious Capital\', as opposed to \'Real /
Productive Capital\', which is money spent on physical assets that add
to the means of production, such as machines and labour.

Marx viewed [**[an increase in Fictitious Capital]{.mark} as [an
inevitable sympton of Cap]{.mark}italism[\'s endless drive for]{.mark}
[accumulation]{.mark},** [which]{.mark} in turn [increases
instability]{.mark} in economic systems, by detaching the value of
capital from the physical realities and limits of its
production,]{.underline} which ultimately leads to crashes. In 2008, the
distribution of subprime mortgages artificially boosted the values of
houses, by detaching their actual value (based on the real-world supply)
from the value of speculative assets linked to them. [Pretty soon, many
of those tied into these adjustable-rate mortgages, who had never
actually been able to afford their house, defaulted, the market was
flooded with their old homes, house prices crashed, and \... we all
remember the rest (- just kidding, I was 4).]{.underline}

Many consider the most troubling aspect of the global financial crisis
to be its aftermath. More specifically, the bailouts. [[The US
Gov]{.mark}ernment alone [spent]{.mark} somewhere in the region of
[\$498 billion]{.mark} (yes, billion) [to bail]{.mark} out the very
[banks]{.mark} who had caused the crisis.]{.underline} These were
\"actions of necessity, not choice\" according to Larry Summers, US
economic advisor at the [time. They had to be. [How]{.mark} else
[could]{.mark} [governments]{.mark}, designed to enact the will of the
people, [**take their citizen\'s money** and give to the]{.mark} very
[organisations]{.mark} who had caused the whole mess? The answer is
simple for Marx: [morality]{.mark} is not objective, instead it [is a
tool used to further the interests of the **elite**]{.mark}. Why bailout
the banks? Because under the Capitalist system of the time, it was
\'right\'.]{.underline} Again, for Marx, pillars of the superstructure
are ultimately shaped and used by the ruling class of a society to
further their power. Not only through fabricated morality, but by
constructing ideology (ruling ideas) as well.

\"These individuals composing [the ruling class possess among other
things consciousness, and therefore think. Insofar, therefore, as they
rule as a class and determine the extent and compass of an epoch, it is
self-evident that they do this in its whole range,]{.underline} hence
among other things rule also as thinkers, producers of ideas, and
regulate the production and distribution of the ideas of their age: thus
their ideas are the ruling ideas of the epoch.\"

Throughout and after the financial crisis, British newspapers largely
avoided discussing the bailouts and ensuing austerity in a \'negative\'
light, instead using neutral language. By 2010, the same newspapers even
began discussing these measures and the prevailing austerity as
\'unavoidable\'. If you\'re going to oppress people, convincing them it
is for their own good is a useful step.

Thankfully for Marx, this was not a total success on the part of the
elites. [Their action were not forgotten, and [tensions between]{.mark}
[the victims and the preprators]{.mark} came to a head in 2011, with the
Occupy Wallstreet movement.]{.underline} What started as a small protest
group in New York City, [quickly [grew]{.mark}]{.underline} [into a
global movement, attempting to push back against wealth inequality and
corporate influence in politics.]{.underline} While this level of class
consciousness and unification of the working class would have been sure
to bring tears of joy to Marx\'s eyes, the movement ultimately fell
short of what was necessary. Whilst strong in collective spirit, Occupy
Wallstreet was ultimately a disorganised campaign, with a lack of clear
ends, and little thought given to the means to those ends. [For Marx,
**[the ideal for]{.mark} meaningful [change]{.mark}** in a society
[began with class consciousness]{.mark} and rejection of the prevailing
system, but it necessarily ended with the working-class (\'the
revolution class\') seizing power of the state and dismantling the
existing institutions, as well as scrapping the idea of classes
together.]{.underline} It does not suffice to simply ask for more from a
system that is inherently designed to serve the elite and exploit the
proletariat - within this framework, changes will always be trivial and
justice for the proletariat is impossible. Justice must be fought for
and taken.

Ultimately, Marx\'s ideas ring true just as much today, as they did when
they were first conceived. [[The]{.mark} [2008]{.mark} financial [crisis
was a **stark demonstration of** ]{.mark}**the [inherent flaws in
Cap]{.mark}**italism: [the instability]{.mark} that [is]{.mark}
[unavoidable]{.mark} in the face of unending and unregulated
accumulation of capital, **[the willingness of the elite]{.mark} to take
from the working people** to further their own interests and desires,
[and the futility of]{.mark} the [movements]{.mark} of the working class
that do not act in the name of revolution.]{.underline}

### Impact\-\--Inequality\-\--2NC

#### Extreme inequality and late-stage capitalism makes an uprising inevitable -- history proves. 

**Davis \'25**. \[Jerry J. Davis;\]. \"America's Cruise to Nowhere:
Late-Stage Capitalism in Motion.\" Medium.

//KKang

[Are we racing full speed toward disaster like the Titanic?]{.underline}

[[Late-stage capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark} describes a system
[**[plagued by extreme inequality]{.mark}, [corporate dominance]{.mark}
in politics, and [unsustainable consumerism]{.mark}**. In 2025, the
White House and Republican-led Congress embody this phase, with
[policies]{.mark} overwhelmingly [benefit]{.mark}ing [the
wealthy]{.mark}, corporate interests steering decision-making, and
environmental protections discarded despite looming crises.]{.underline}

[President Donald [Trump's]{.mark} economic **[policies reflect
late-stage cap]{.mark}**italism's defining traits. His administration's
[tax cuts]{.mark}, projected to reduce federal tax revenue by \$5
trillion to \$11 trillion over a decade, disproportionately
[benefit]{.mark} high-income individuals and
[corporations]{.mark}]{.underline}. Critics argue this follows the
pattern of privatizing gains while socializing losses, as resulting
deficits will lead to devastating cuts in essential social programs.
[While supporters claim these cuts will spur investment and wage growth,
historical trends show corporations most typically use such windfalls
for stock buybacks and dividends, inflating asset prices and enriching
executives rather than benefiting workers.]{.underline}

Tariff policies, including a 25% levy on imports from Canada, Mexico,
China, and the EU, further worsen economic instability. [These
[measures]{.mark} will lead to higher consumer prices and job losses,
[mainly affect]{.mark}ing [low]{.mark}er-[income]{.mark}
populations.]{.underline} Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz calls this
approach "crony rentier capitalism," a system that enriches capital
owners at the expense of the majority, concentrating wealth and power
--- a hallmark of late-stage capitalism.

Trump's Cabinet, filled with ultra-wealthy individuals and former
corporate executives, reinforces the melding of economic and political
power. Elon Musk, for instance, inexplicably appointed head of the
Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is an unprecedented Cabinet
role. Other figures, such as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Attorney
General Pam Bondi, illustrate the administration's preference for
high-profile personalities from business and media.

Meanwhile, Trump's close ties with corporate leaders raise concerns
about policy manipulation. His private dinner with Amazon's Jeff Bezos
coincided with editorial shifts at The Washington Post, favoring
narratives on personal liberties and free markets. Such engagements
betray an open alignment between the administration and corporate
interests, reinforcing the fact of an oligarchic system favoring the
elite.

To maintain support amid growing inequality, the administration relies
on distraction. Trump's media strategies --- hot-mic moments requesting
praise, restructuring the White House press pool to favor right-wing
outlets, and grandiose claims --- align with late-stage capitalism's
preference for spectacle over substance. Policies that primarily benefit
the elite are masked by absurd political theater, diverting public
attention away from where the damage they're doing is on full display.

This 1911 cartoon "Pyramid of Capitalist System" depicts the hierarchy
of a capitalist society --- the wealthy and powerful literally resting
at the top, supported by workers at the bottom. Over a century later,
critics argue this pyramid remains intact, with late-stage capitalism
further widening the gap between the base and the apex.

[Late-stage [capitalist societies]{.mark} historically [show **similar
trends**]{.mark}: extreme [**inequality**, **corruption**,]{.mark} [and
an]{.mark} [**elite** **detached** from]{.mark} the struggles of [the
working class. Comparisons to the Gilded Age are inevitable,]{.mark}
with billionaires amassing unprecedented wealth while income inequality
reaches its highest levels since the 1920s.]{.underline} The top 0.1% of
Americans now hold as much wealth as the bottom 90%, a concentration of
riches reminiscent of the eve of the Great Depression.

Even the late Roman Empire offers a cautionary tale. [Roman **[elites
indulged]{.mark}** in luxury and political games [while **their empire
crumbled**]{.mark} beneath them.]{.underline} Today's ruling class
prioritizes tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy over infrastructure,
healthcare, or wage growth. Political theatrics --- distracting
narratives and populist rhetoric --- serve the same function as Rome's
"bread and circuses," keeping the masses entertained while real issues
remain unaddressed.

[Marxist and critical [theorists predicted]{.mark} many of [today's
patterns: **wealth concentration**]{.mark}, the [capitalist]{.mark}
[class capturing]{.mark} political [power, and]{.mark} the eventual
[crises caused by overproduction]{.mark} and inequality. Karl Marx
foresaw capitalism's self-destructive tendencies,]{.underline} where the
system feeds on itself until it collapses. The current administration's
policies, favoring short-term corporate gains over sustainable economic
stability, follows this trajectory.

[Lenin's view of [imperialism as cap]{.mark}italism['s]{.mark} [final
stage]{.mark} finds [echoes]{.mark} in [Trump]{.mark}-era policies
prioritizing resource control over global cooperation.]{.underline}
Neoliberal scholars point to regulatory capture, erosion of safety nets,
and public disillusionment with democracy --- trends vividly displayed
in today's governance. The phrase "late-stage capitalism" has even gone
mainstream, used to mock modern absurdities, from \$5 million beachfront
condos selling while sea levels rise to companies offering "thoughts and
prayers" apps instead of healthcare benefits.

[The Trump era exemplifies late-stage capitalism's contradictions:
wealth concentration, political corruption, and environmental neglect.
Economic **[policies deepen inequality]{.mark}**, [political decisions
serve **the**]{.mark} [**elite**, and **environmental** stances
**mortgage** the future for present gain]{.mark}]{.underline}. America
today really does resemble a cruise ship where the first-class deck
enjoys luxury, engine-room workers toil unrewarded, and the captain
denies the iceberg ahead.

[History shows such **[a trajectory is
unsustainable]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The question remains: will the
U.S. correct course, or are we witnessing the final act of an empire on
the brink?

#### Growth makes inequality [worse]{.underline}.

A second motivation behind post-growth research, dating back to the same
era as Limits to Growth, is the observation that above a certain level
of income, [**[GDP]{.mark}** growth [does **not** improve]{.mark}
**human [wellbeing]{.mark}**]{.underline}.86 The social limits
hypothesis holds that there is a limit to the extent that growth
improves subjective wellbeing, because humans adapt to higher levels of
income,87 and compare themselves to others who are also getting
richer,88 or because additional production goes towards zero-sum status
goods.89 The social cost hypothesis is that above a certain level of
GDP, the costs of growth (eg, congestion, pollution, mental health,
social upheaval) might offset its wellbeing benefits.90 Growth is said
to become uneconomic.91

One line of evidence supporting the social limits hypothesis is the
much-debated **[[Easterlin paradox]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in which
self-reported happiness is found to vary directly with income, both
between and within nations, but over time the growth of income is not
significantly related to the growth of happiness.92 This finding has
been challenged93 and it seems that the empirical relationship between
growth and happiness depends on the set of countries, the length of
period, and the type of wellbeing that is measured.94 Moreover, although
[**[income]{.mark}** and **[happiness]{.mark}** appear to be
[**related** during **decreases** in **GDP**]{.mark}, this relationship
[does **not apply** during]{.mark} GDP
**[increases]{.mark}**]{.underline}.95 New studies that have inspired
post-growth research have shown that [countries with **[full
employment]{.mark}** policies, strong [social **safety nets**]{.mark},
and **[decommodified]{.mark}** public [services exhibit
**increased**]{.mark} life [satisfaction]{.mark}]{.underline}88,96 and
that human relations have a much stronger effect on personal wellbeing
than income.97

Research on wellbeing has shown that a [**[wide]{.mark}** range of
**[indicators]{.mark}** of social outcomes [show **diminishing** returns
as **GDP**]{.mark} per person **[increases]{.mark}**]{.underline}.95
These indicators include the first seven Sustainable Development Goals
(no poverty, zero hunger, good health, quality education, gender equity,
safe water, and sufficient energy), which, under existing arrangements,
are achieved at a GDP of around \$15 000 per person (measured in 2011 US
purchasing power parity dollars).98 [**Improvements** in social
outcomes]{.underline} have been found to be [**driven** primarily
by]{.underline} factors other than income, such as [public health
programmes and other **public services**]{.underline}.99--101

Tentative support for the social cost thesis comes from research on
alternative indicators to GDP.102 The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI),
for example, is a more comprehensive metric of progress that, in
contrast to GDP, distinguishes between damaging and beneficial
activity.3 A meta-analysis of 17 countries finds a general pattern of
levelling-off of GPI, and a decoupling of GPI from GDP.3 Globally, GPI
per capita peaked in 1978 and has since not increased beyond about
\$7000 per capita (measured in 2005 US\$).

The Russian Marxist revolutionary Vladimir Lenin described imperialism
as the monopoly stage of capitalism: [[wealth is concentrated
with]{.mark} a few [giant corporations]{.mark} and [super-rich
capitalists]{.mark} that link up with and are [controlled by a
few]{.mark} very large [banks that]{.mark} can [manipulate the
economy.]{.mark}]{.underline} In their thirst for increasingly
profitable returns on investments, finance [capital must [resort to
going beyond national boundaries]{.mark}]{.underline}, setting their
sights on foreign markets, resources, and labor. [For [territories
not]{.mark} yet [under]{.mark} the thumb of [capitalist rule]{.mark}, it
has [meant forced colonization]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the case of
[[rivalries between superpowers]{.underline}]{.mark}, it can mean a
[complicated web of [trade deals or economic
sanctions]{.mark}]{.underline}; but [when that [fails to produce]{.mark}
the [desired results]{.mark} for different sections of the ruling class,
it has [meant bloody war]{.mark}]{.underline}. In any of these
scenarios, the working and oppressed classes are forced to pay with

Large, [[American]{.mark}-based [**corporations make investments** all
over the world]{.mark}]{.underline}. To do so, they need a global
economic environment in which they have relatively open access to world
markets and their investments are protected from confiscation by
governments. [One of the motivations for a large and effective military
is that force can play a role in securing these conditions. In earlier
periods of capitalist development, this was one of the central
motivations for colonialism: **[colonial empires]{.mark}**, forged
[through military conquest, provide]{.mark}d [access to markets]{.mark}
and products [for capitalists]{.mark} based in the home countries of
colonial powers.]{.underline} Colonialism more or less came to an end in
the decades following the Second World War, [but the need for a secure
global environment for capital accumulation remained, and military power
continued to play a role in creating and protecting that
environment.]{.underline} In particular[, American [military power
played a]{.mark}n active [role in **opposing**]{.mark} certain kinds of
nationalist movements **[a]{.mark}nd [revolutionary socialist
movements]{.mark}** in poor countries that posed a potential threat to
global capitalism in general and American corporate
interests]{.underline}

[[**Militarism** is]{.mark} both [a fact of life]{.mark} and a way of
life [in the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates at the beginning of the 21st
century.]{.underline} While the Obama administration was elected
partially because of his early opposition to the Iraq War, he has
continually reassured the American public that he fully supports a
strong military and has demonstrated his willingness to use military
force to advance foreign policy objectives. [There is no indication that
he will depart in any fundamental way from this institutional
configuration. What can we expect for the future? Chalmers Johnson
argues that [if]{.mark} the kind of **[intensive militarism]{.mark}**
that has become part of the fabric of American society [continues,
four]{.mark} [consequences are likely to
follow]{.mark}]{.underline}[:]{.mark}

[1. Perpetual war [Militarism generates war]{.mark}; it is not simply a
response to war. [The triumph of]{.mark} [American militarism is likely
to place the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [in]{.mark} a situation of
nearly **[continuous warfare.]{.mark}**]{.underline} With a massive and
flexible military force in hand[, the U.S. is much more likely to use
the military option in the context of a conflict than if we had a purely
defensive military posture. [An aggressive,]{.mark} [interventionist
posture]{.mark} around the world [provokes reactions in response
to]{.mark} our [interventions]{.mark}. This is sometimes called
"blowback": **[terrorism is]{.mark} in part [a response to

further intervention and militarism.]{.underline}

[[Capitalism **is the most bloody**]{.mark} **and warlike [society in
human history]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The armies of Alexander the Great
were a fraction of the number of dead in the Vietnam War. All the
weapons possessed by the Crusaders of the Middle Ages could not do the
damage in a week that a modern 'daisy cutter' bomb dropped in
Afghanistan can wreak in seconds. The last 100 years in particular has
seen enough people killed in wars to have depopulated the known world in
previous eras.

[[Capitalism was born a murderous infant]{.mark} and [its appetite for
slaughter has grown]{.mark} as it has aged.]{.underline} The first
capitalist state, England, had no sooner settled accounts with Charles I
and the old order than it turned to butchering the inhabitants of its
first colonies in Ireland and Jamaica.

The American settlers had barely thrown off the yoke of British rule
before they set about annihilating the American and Canadian natives of
those lands. Meanwhile the British had found fresh blood to let in
India, Africa and elsewhere.

The French Revolution saved the country from the ancient oppression of
the monarch and his nobles, but as soon as the capitalist class was
secure Napoleon's armies set out to create an empire, the last shreds of
which French forces still fight to defend today.

[As industry spread across the globe, [the]{.mark}se [first capitalist
states were joined]{.mark} by others\~Germany, Japan, Italy, Russia\~[in
their **hunt for gold**]{.mark} **and [slaves, oil]{.mark} and
[opium,]{.mark}** markets, cheap [labour]{.mark} and strategic
advantage. [The competition]{.mark} between them [gave us the **First
World War**]{.mark}. The same development of industry which led to the
imperialist rivalries that sparked the war also ensured it was the most
bloody which had ever been fought .]{.underline}

[[W]{.mark}eapons of [m]{.mark}ass [d]{.mark}estruction unimaginable
before the development of industry now [killed
millions]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Tanks and machine guns, gas and
aircraft made this the first war in which the majority of dead were the
victims of other soldiers, not of disease. The British alone lost 20,000
dead in a single day on the Somme and one million dead in the four years
of war. [And [if cap]{.mark}italist industry [caused the war it]{.mark}
also [had to keep the war going]{.mark}. Directed [labour, censorship,
conscription]{.mark} and the bombing of towns [made]{.mark}
[this]{.mark} the first total war, [a war fought at home]{.mark} as well
as on the battlefield.]{.underline}

The First World War did nothing to solve the crisis that had produced
it. The economic crises of capitalism continued and the latecomers to
the imperialist contest still chaffed at the limits set by the older
powers. [[The **Second World War** broke]{.mark} out [just 20 years
after the peace conference]{.mark} that was supposed to set up a new
international order.]{.underline}

The [intervening years had worsened all the obscenities which
characterised the First World War]{.underline}. More lives were eaten up
by more terrible weapons, culminating in the United States' use of the
atomic bomb against an already beaten Japan. Civilians were more than
ever the targets of warfare, as the carpet bombing of Dresden and other
German cities by Britain testified. The Russians alone lost 20 million
dead.

[[At the]{.mark} war's [end]{.mark} the major powers dusted themselves
down and once again began preparing for another. [Spending]{.mark} on
arms [reached unprecedented levels]{.mark}. Nazi rocket scientists were
quickly brought to the US and Britain to help perfect the weapons they
had begun work on under Hitler.]{.underline} Within five years [**[the
Korean War]{.mark}** was under way, at a cost of 1.5 million
lives.]{.underline} Within a decade of its end [the **[Vietnam]{.mark}**
War]{.underline} had begun, in which 55.000 US troops would die. The
Vietnamese struggle for liberation eventually cost 2.5 million dead,
many of them peasants murdered by US soldiers, carpet bombing and napalm
attacks. Millions died in Iraq as a result of sanctions and the first
and second Gulf Wars.

But Korea, Vietnam and [[Iraq]{.mark}]{.underline} are only the best
known wars to have gripped the world since the peace celebrations in
1945. In fact the world has not been at peace for a single day since
then. Over 80 wars have kept the generals and the munitions industry
busy. The death toll is somewhere between 15 and 30 million people.
Today some 10 countries are in the grip of war.

And the victims cannot simply be numbered by counting those killed by
bombs and guns. Today millions of refugees have fled their homes within
their country. It is a migration greater than the homeless hordes who
crossed Europe at the end of the Second World War.

[[Even when no shot is fired,]{.mark} the incalculable [**billions
poured into the arms industry** mean]{.mark} that every day babies and
old people, the sick and the homeless, [the]{.mark} poor and the
dispossessed die because the means to save their lives has been used up
in weapons production.]{.underline}

So why is our system so bloody? Why does the carnage grow with each
succeeding generation? Could there be a capitalist system without war?
[[The key feature of cap]{.mark}italism, as right-wingers constantly
tell us**, [is competition]{.mark}.** Competition drives the least
efficient to the wall, we are told, so that only the most profitable
survive.]{.underline} Firms, be they the corner shop or the Ford
corporation, are constantly looking for new customers or markets, for
cheaper suppliers and to pay their workforces less than their rivals.
"The national interest" is defined as the defence of "our" markets and
"our" industry.

[[In]{.mark} the economic [textbooks]{.mark} this [competition is
portrayed as]{.mark} entirely [peaceful]{.mark},]{.underline} conducted
only through the impersonal operations of the market. [In reality **[it
has never been peaceful]{.mark}**. The [capitalists]{.mark} have [never
stuck]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the [rules]{.mark} either when they deal with
their workers or with their rivals.]{.underline} Hired thugs or the
police will break up union meetings and the army will break strikes. The
police and the law, the press and the courts have always been at the
beck and call of the employers to ensure that wages stay low and unions
stay cowed. From the Tolpuddle Martyrs through the General Strike of
1926 to the Great Miners' Strike of 1984, that is the story of the class
struggle in Britain.

\[paragraphs ommitted\]

[**[That competition]{.mark} between the powers [has never
halted]{.mark}**[. Treaties and peace pledges]{.mark} have been
[broke]{.mark}n. [The League of Nations]{.mark}, set up to keep the
peace after the First World War, [failed]{.mark} to stop either the rise
of fascism or the outbreak of a new world war.]{.underline} The United
Nations, set up for the same reason after the Second World War, has
either proved as impotent as its forerunner or has itself acted as a
weapon of war[. In whatever way the major capitalist powers have tried
to regulate the military competition between them, they have always
failed.]{.underline}

[[Competition]{.mark}, the drive [to accumulate]{.mark} factories, banks
and transport facilities faster than your rivals [is at the]{.mark}
[root of war]{.mark}]{.underline}. It was so when capitalism was born
and it is still so today, despite the fact that the consequences are
more ruinous than they ever were. To rid society of war we have to rid
it of the system that fosters war. [[To get rid of]{.mark} military
[competition we have to get rid of]{.mark} the [economic
competition]{.mark} that succours it. For the generals to be forced from
the battlefield, the capitalists who arm them and on whose behalf they
do battle must be forced from the factories and offices.\\]{.underline}

Searching for New Wars

[[As]{.mark} the enthusiasm for [war on terror ebbs]{.mark} in
America,]{.underline} Pentagon [[hawks have been searching for
new]{.mark} [wars]{.mark} and escalations.]{.underline} [[The primary
targets]{.mark} of this fresh militaristic discourse [have been China
and Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline} These belligerent verbal onslaughts
have been re-packaged as "infinite war." In a 2018 speech, Air Force
General James Michael Holmes explained "infinite war" as "not losing.
It's staying in the game and getting a new plan and keeping pursuing
your objectives."

In his book The United States of War, David Vine [describes [the]{.mark}
utter [irrationality of waging an imperialist]{.mark} [offensive]{.mark}
against China and Russia]{.underline}: "Just as the global war on
terrorism has spread terror and exponentially expanded the number of
militants willing to carry out terrorist acts, [[the creation of
new]{.mark} U.S. [bases]{.mark} to protect against imagined future
Chinese or Russian threats [risks becoming]{.mark} a self-fulfilling
prophecy: [the proliferation of U.S. bases i]{.mark}n East Asia, coupled
with aggressive naval and air patrols and military exercises, [risks
creating a]{.mark}n ever-[more-powerful]{.mark} Chinese military
[threat]{.mark} that the U.S. buildup is supposedly designed to protect
against.]{.underline} Contrary to the claim that bases increase global
security, they are ratcheting up an arms race and regional military
tensions[." In the current period, [we need to]{.mark} strongly [reject

"[The [more **cap**]{.mark}**italism** is developed]{.underline}," he
wrote, "the [[more]{.mark} strongly the **[shortage]{.mark}** of raw
material**[s]{.mark}** is felt, the [more]{.mark} intense the
**[competition]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the hunt for sources of raw
materials throughout the world, the more [**desperate** the
struggle]{.underline} for the acquisition of colonies."

In Lenin's day, this struggle centred on oilfields, iron ore and the
like. With the development of computer technology and now AI, [**[raw
materials]{.mark}** crucial to the making of **semiconductors**,
**batteries** and communications systems have become the [**centre**
of]{.mark} a [global **struggle**]{.mark}]{.underline} for acquisition
of these resources. It has [become an **[existential]{.mark}** question
[for the **US**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Lenin's analysis of the objective, material driving forces for war,
rooted in the domination of capitalist production by giant monopolies,
very often owned by key sections of finance capital, has often been
dismissed as too crude, out of date, an example of "vulgar" Marxism, and
so on.

But the [**conflict** between the **US** and the **E**uropean **U**nion
over how the spoils of the **Ukraine** war]{.underline} should be
divided up has revealed once again that [[**imperialist** wars]{.mark}
are **not** [fought for]{.mark} "**democracy**]{.underline}" or
"self-determination," "protection" of small nations, "peace," etc., [but
for **[plunder]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The crucial issue of raw materials is the subject of a recent analysis
by the Center for Strategic and International Studies
(**[CSIS]{.underline}**), a major think tank for US imperialism.

It began by [emphasising the importance of **minerals**]{.underline}.

"[**Mining** is the foundation that allowed the **U**nited **S**tates to
be a **military** leader]{.underline}, providing the minerals needed to
manufacture tanks, missiles, fighter jets, and warships."

But as with everything else in today's world, these weapons now require
computerised systems and increasingly AI to operate, and this requires
access to minerals that were only of limited importance in the past.

The CSIS immediately cut to the chase. "Today the [**U**nited **S**tates
is **100 percent** import-reliant for **12** of the 50 minerals
identified]{.underline} as critical by the US Geological Survey (USGS)
and over [**50 percent** import-reliant for another **29**]{.underline}.
China is the top producer for 29 of these critical minerals," it said.

"China," it continued, "has a stranglehold on minerals processing,
refining between 40 and 90 percent of the world's supply of rare
elements, graphite, lithium, cobalt, and copper."

Like all other so-called mainstream publications, the New York Times has
worked to cover over the essential driving forces of US wars and has
actively joined in covering up the real motivations, such as in the 2003
war on Iraq when it was the chief promoter of the Big Lie that Iraq
possessed weapons of mass destruction.

But even it has been forced to acknowledge the role of mineral resources
as a driver of US policy, citing a remark by Trump that "I want security
of the rare earth" at the beginning of a recent article referencing the
CSIS analysis.

"The president has talked about acquiring minerals in Greenland and
Canada," it continued, and noted that Canadian Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau had told a group of business leaders that Trump's focus on
Canada's minerals meant threats to annex the country were "a real
thing."

The article said that seizing [**[mineral wealth]{.mark}** overseas was
a **[core fo]{.mark}**reign **[po]{.mark}**licy
[goal]{.mark}]{.underline} of Trump and "an [**impetus** for his most
**imperialistic** remarks]{.underline} since taking office. His
instincts hark back to the drives of fallen empires, when [resource
**extraction** motivated rulers to **expand** territory]{.underline}."

The likening of the US to fallen empires of the past is not misplaced.
Its rise to [**dominance** of the imperialist-**capitalist** system was
based on its **industrial** power]{.underline}. Today the [**US** is the
centre of unprecedented **speculation**]{.underline} and has been hit
with [three **financial heart attacks**]{.underline} in the past 16
years---the 2008 crisis, the March 2020 crisis at the start of the
pandemic, and the failure of three significant American banks in March
2023.

The extent of the [problems confronting **[US imperialism]{.mark}** as
it [seeks **domination**]{.mark} of the world's supply of **critical
minerals**]{.underline} and resources is documented throughout the CSIS
report.

It noted that semiconductors were foundational for virtually every part
of modern life, requiring small but essential components of gallium,
germanium, palladium, silicon, arsenic, titanium, as well as other
elements.

"The [**production** of these resources is largely concentrated in
**foreign** adversaries, exposing a severe **national security**
risk]{.underline}. USGS has estimated that just a 30 percent supply
disruption of gallium could cause a \$602 billion decline in US economic
output, amounting to a 2.1 percent loss of gross domestic product."

The issue confronting the US is not just the location of rare earths,
critical minerals and vital metals such as copper. Mining them is only
the start of a complex process in which they have to be refined. And
here the question is having those industrial processes in place.

As the report noted, [crucial [**US industries** are reliant on]{.mark}
**supply chains** that are "heavily concentrated in [**foreign**
adversaries]{.mark}]{.underline}."

"Over the course of decades and with the assistance of state-led
industrial policies and billions of dollars in subsidies, China has
grown to dominate the manufacturing sector for the cutting-edge
technologies that the modern economy relies on. [The **[risk]{.mark}**
this poses to **US** national]{.underline} and economic security [[is
**untenable**]{.underline}]{.mark}."

Clearly, [if it is **untenable**, then it [must be **ended**]{.mark} and
[by whatever means]{.mark} US imperialism considers
**[necessary]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Returning again to his evangelizing style of conversational encounter,
earlier this week Pope Francis gave an interview with the Spanish
magazine La Vanguardia (Spanish original here). Although covering a
range of topics, such as Pope Pius XII's role in the Holocaust and the
possibility of his own retirement as pope, much attention has been given
to another comment on the economy, in this case [Francis's
[linking]{.mark} of the [global capitalist economy with
war]{.mark}]{.underline}. Pope Francis states (This quotation is from
the Catholic News Service story on the interview, which provides a
better translation of the quote than the full text linked above):

[We are in a **[world economic system]{.mark}** that is **[not
good]{.mark}**. A **[system]{.mark} that** **in order [to survive must
make wa]{.mark}r,** as great empires have always done. But since you
cannot have a Third World War, you have regional wars. And what does
this mean? That **arms are made and sold**, and in this way the
**idolatrous economies, the great world [economies]{.mark} that
[sacrifice man]{.mark} [at]{.mark} the [feet of]{.mark} the [idol of
money]{.mark}, obviously keep their balance sheets in the
black.**]{.underline}

Like Francis's earlier statements on the free market, both in his
apostolic exhortation Evangelii Gaudium and in his more occasional
comments, this statement provokes the conscience and asks us to ponder
questions we might prefer to avoid: [Does my [own **consumer lifestyle
contribute**]{.mark} to the **[death of others in violent
conflict]{.mark}**? Is the United States' promotion of the free market
abroad linked to its involvement in foreign wars?]{.underline} Also like
Francis's statements on the economy, however, what Francis's statement
gains in rhetorical power, it lacks in the careful distinctions and
development needed for a full understanding of the relationship between
capitalism and war. Perhaps Francis expects Catholics, duly provoked, to
engage in this process of reflection, so this is my humble contribution.

A discussion of the relationship between capitalism and war can't help
but begin with the "founder" of capitalism himself, Adam Smith. [Smith
believed that **state intervention in the market**, and in particular
preferential trade arrangements between nations and tariffs and quotas
on foreign trade, **made conflict between nations more likely.** The
**elimination of these barrier**s, on the other hand, would help
**create more pacific relationships between nations**. This **connection
between free trade and peace has been a recurring theme of economic
liberalism ever since**]{.underline}. Perhaps the most unfortunate
advocate of this view was Norman Angell, who in his book The Great
Illusion argued that the increasing economic interdependence of Europe
had made war practically obsolete; his work was first published in 1909,
a mere five years before the outbreak of the First World War.

Perhaps surprisingly, the most well-known critic of capitalism, [Karl
Marx, shared Smith's belief that capitalism and peace between states
were linked.]{.underline} Like Smith, [Marx believed that **increasing
commerce** would **lead capitalist states to live in peace**. Marx
attributed the war-like behavior of the states of his own
day]{.underline}, such as Prussia under Otto von Bismarck and France
under Napoleon III, precisely to their failure to develop fully
capitalist economies. Obviously, Marx believed that the conflict within
capitalism, between workers and owners, was fundamental, but he did not
believe that there was anything inherent within capitalism that would
bring one capitalist state into conflict with another.

Interestingly, the **[[seeds for]{.mark} the [contrary opinion]{.mark}
were [sown within capitalist economics itself]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In
the nineteenth century, the minority opinion within capitalist economics
was that underconsumption was a persistent feature of the capitalist
economy, meaning that factories would consistently produce more than the
working class could consume with their wages, leading to repeated bouts
of economic stagnation. The first to link this supposed feature of
capitalism with war was the economist John A. Hobson, who argued in his
1902 work Imperialism that the European powers' pursuit of colonies, and
the conflict amongst themselves over them, was the result of the pursuit
of new markets for the consumption of the surplus goods produced in the
home market. This idea was stolen (sorry, expropriated) and turned into
a critique of capitalism by Lenin in his 1917 pamphlet Imperialism, the
Highest Stage of Capitalism.

A quite different explanation of the relationship between capitalism and
war that still drew on the theory of underconsumption was provided by
the historian Charles A. Beard (better known for his 1913 book An
Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States). In
his 1932 work The Devil Theory of War, [Beard argued that **capitalist
[states seek to overcome]{.mark} the [problem of
underconsumption]{.mark}** by **[shifting civilian production to]{.mark}
the [production of arms]{.mark}**, and by **[provoking war]{.mark} to
[provide]{.mark} a [persistent demand for]{.mark} those
[weapons]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

The problem with both ways of linking capitalism and war that draw on
the theory of underconsumption is that underconsumption is not a
persistent feature of capitalism. Although clearly building on
underconumption theory, in his The General Theory of Employment,
Interest and Money, the economist John Mayanrd Keynes showed that the
other components of his new concept of aggregate demand, namely
investment, government spending, and exports, can account for the
consumption of products not accounted for by private consumption. Keynes
agreed that a lack of private consumption could contribute to an
economic downturn, but he decisively showed that this was not a
necessary feature of capitalism, and therefore could not be an adequate
explanation of war among capitalist states.

Despite their empirical problems, linkages of capitalism and war drawing
on the theory of underconsumption had some purchase in the Catholic
world. For example, in Loaves and Fishes, Dorothy Day argues that
capitalists by necessity push for war because "our whole modern economy
is based on preparation for war," as the armaments industry compensates
for underconsumption. Quite surprisingly, in his 1931 encyclical
Quadragesimo Anno, Pope Pius XI mirrors some of Lenin's criticisms of
the link between finance capitalism, imperialism, and war. Francis
appears to provide at least some echoes of these theories, claiming that
capitalism is "a system that in order to survive must make war," and
that states make war to "keep their balance sheets in the black."

Another common way of **[[linking]{.mark} the [cap]{.mark}italist
[economy with war is to point out]{.mark} the r[ole of "war
profiteering."]{.mark}]{.underline}** For example, President Franklin
Roosevelt was accused by isolationists of entering the Second World War
at the behest of war profiteers in the armaments industry. Similar
arguments were made about the role of "Big Oil" and corporations such as
Halliburton in the Iraq War. Pope Francis also hints at this theory with
his criticism of the arms trade, a constant object of condemnation in
papal statements on war going back at least to Pope John XXIII.

Although it is certainly the case that many industries, and in
particular the arms industry, profit from war, this theory fails for one
crucial reason: The number of businesses and industries that will suffer
as a result of war will always far outnumber those who profit from it,
through the disruption of trade, the destruction of capital, and the
loss of consumers through war-related deaths. This theory provides no
good explanation for why war profiteers would have more influence on
government decision-making than the much larger number of businesses who
will lose out as a result of war. Of course, a government might give
inordinate influence to corporations that benefit from war, but
precisely because they are drawn to war for other reasons.

Is there in fact a link between the capitalist economy and war? In their
2001 book Triangulating Peace, the political scientists Bruce Russett
and John R. Oneal provide empirical evidence that the presence of the
thick economic ties between nations fostered by global capitalism (as
well as democratic governance and shared participation in multilateral
institutions) greatly decreases the likelihood of war between those
nations. Therefore, to an extent, Adam Smith was right. Worldwide, the
incidence of war and the number of war casualties has declined over the
past few decades, precisely during the time of U.S. liberal political
and economic hegemony. This decline can partly be explained by the
commercial peace described by Russett and Oneal, although other factors
certainly play a role, as well.

So [is Pope Francis simply wrong about the link between the capitalist
economy and war? **[Not so fast]{.mark}**.]{.underline} First, note that
what Russett and Oneal have found is relative peace between states
already deeply embedded in the capitalist economy; [this **[says very
little]{.mark}** about **[how prone]{.mark} a [capitalist nation]{.mark}
is to [go to war with]{.mark} a [non-capitalist]{.mark} one**. Political
scientists have found that while democracies tend to live in peace with
one another, **[democracies]{.mark} can in fact [go to war wit]{.mark}h
their [non-democratic neighbors]{.mark}, and [wage war more
vehemently]{.mark}, than non-democracies**; perhaps something
**[similar]{.mark} is [true of capitalism]{.mark}**.]{.underline} More
importantly, although the United States has created a relative zone of
peace under its liberal hegemony, **[history shows that the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has [not hesitated]{.mark} to [use force
to create and]{.mark} [maintain]{.mark} that
[heg]{.mark}emony]{.underline}**. Particularly during the Cold War, the
United States fomented or became involved in conflicts throughout Latin
America, Africa, and Asia against nations or movements that challenged
the liberal capitalist order. The roll call is familiar: Argentina,
Nicaragua, El Salvador, Congo, Angola, Mozambique, Nigeria, Vietnam, and
more.

Admittedly, conflicts such as these have been far less common in the
post-Cold War world. **[Many [recent conflicts]{.mark} have [centered on
failed]{.mark} or [weak states]{.mark}]{.underline}**, either as part of
the War on Terror (Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia) or in various civil wars
in Africa (Burundi, Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Liberia, Central African
Republic, etc.). In at least some of these cases, [the governments of
these nations have been **[weakened through U.S. and Western support of

[raw materials]{.mark}**, rather than more broadly-based
movements,]{.underline} or by International Monetary Fund policies that
weakened governments in the fruitless attempt to pay back massive
foreign debts. Pope Francis suggests that, [even **apart** **from direct
U.S. involvement in these conflicts**, our **[neglect of]{.mark} these
[conflicts]{.mark} itself [reflects aspects of]{.mark} a [capitalist

Economies around the world were shocked and damaged over the course of
2022. **[[Global capitalism]{.mark} had been [brewing conflicts
among]{.mark} the [major powers]{.mark}]{.underline}** (the United
States, China, and the EU) for some time as their relative strengths and
vulnerabilities shifted. [U.S. Wcapitalism and its empire are widely
perceived as waning. Europe's role as a U.S. ally and indeed its
economic future became correspondingly riskier as a result.]{.underline}

China's economic growth encountered problems but continued to be
remarkably positive and often crucially supportive of world economic
conditions in ways that were once more closely associated with the role
of the United States. [**China's deepening alliance with Russia as well
as its** burgeoning **global economic reach frightened many in the
United States**. **[Years of increasingly aggressive
competition]{.mark}**, **[tariff and trade wars,]{.mark} and [bans and
subsidies]{.mark}, mostly [initiated by]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates, [culminated]{.mark} this [past year in global economic
warfare]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

The key fact is not the military war between Russia and Ukraine, so far
a limited, secondary affair except for the massive on-the-ground
suffering of the Ukrainian people and the soldiers on both sides of the
conflict. [The year's **[key reality]{.mark}** is rather the
**[econ]{.mark}omic [warfare between]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark} the [EU]{.mark} [versus Russia and
China]{.mark}**: sanctions and countersanctions]{.underline}. Their
ramifications (energy price spikes, supply chain disruptions, and
massive market shifts) worsened the inflation already troubling many
countries. These, in turn, provoked central bank interest rate increases
that added more disruptive and costly shocks to an already problematic
2022 global economy.

For decades, wealth and income have been redistributed upward---with
minimal protest by the working classes who were harmed by that
redistribution. During 2022, working classes in many countries were no
longer willing to defer their needs in the wake of that redistribution.

Labor militancy, unionization, and strikes have all been renewed with
remarkable energy and enthusiasm. Increasing numbers of workers are
unwilling to wait and see whether or not long sluggish center-left and
center-right governments and parties would do anything adequate to
change the deepening inequalities, instabilities, and injustices of
contemporary capitalism.

Capitalism's victims increasingly rediscovered and resumed alliances
with its critics. Thus, they know that stagflation, not recovery, may
well be the result of inflation plus interest rate hikes. The emergence
of the Global South as an important player in great power politics and
its current realignments took further steps during 2022. Widespread
feelings that an old capitalist world is falling apart are not fading.

Those feelings emerge into public view during a period of massive
contradictions---for example, the resurgence of both white supremacy and
anti-fascism, or the blows against abortion access in the U.S. following
the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in contrast with
France's enshrining of abortion access in its constitution. Chinese
workers demand better wages and working conditions while the dishonesty
of global capitalist polluters gets increasingly exposed.

Meanwhile, global changes in great power alignments risk being
misunderstood or undervalued because clashing capitalisms disguise
themselves, yet again, in great principles. Russia versus Ukraine gets
rewritten as anti-Russian North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
expansion versus Ukrainian self-determination. [**U.S. [capitalism's
shift from neoliberal globalization to government-led economic
nationalism]{.mark} to [counter China's rise]{.mark} in the [global
economy gets rewritten]{.mark} as required by "national
security."**]{.underline} The further fracturing of Europe's unity gets
rewritten, in truly upside-down fashion, as a rebuilt U.S.-EU-NATO
alliance. Proliferating delusions need deciphering.

Global capitalism has already stumbled badly three times in this new
century: the dot-com crisis in 2000, the subprime mortgage crisis in
2008, and the COVID-19 crisis in 2020. Calling each crisis by a
different, conjunctural name thinly disguises a cyclic instability
intrinsic to and as old as capitalism. The [[capitalist system]{.mark}
that [dominates globally]{.mark} today organizes 99 percent of its
workplaces/enterprises with a small minority of employers who direct the
large majority of employees. It forces today's great powers (the United
States, the EU, and China) to mobilize their allies and compete to shape
the decisions of the Global South. The post-World War II years of U.S.
hegemony governed and held together a particular global arrangement of
economies. The culmination of **[short-term instabilities]{.mark}** and
**[long-term trends]{.mark}** inside and outside the great powers has
**[undermined U.S. hegemony]{.mark}**. A struggle to shape the emerging
"new world order" is underway.]{.underline} That struggle is the
economic reality as 2022 ends.

The hegemonic war of maneuver is our context now; it will last until or
unless a new global arrangement arrives. The French think tank École de
Guerre Économique (EGE) has for 25 years been studying the shadow wars
for dominance over the global economy with interesting, provocative
results. In October 2022, EGE released a book, Guerre Économique: Qui
Est l'Ennemi? (Economic War: Who Is the Enemy?), which presented the
findings of a survey of French business experts that was conducted by
EGE's Centre de Recherche 451 (CR451) in July 2022. Respondents were
asked to name five foreign powers that most threaten France's interests.
They answered that the United States was France's greatest threat, with
China, Germany, Russia, and the UK following, in descending order.

It would be wishful thinking to mistake this result as peculiar to the
French. [[Many leaders]{.mark} and influencers around the world
[criticize]{.mark} and resent the [last 75 years of economic hegemony
wielded by]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates.]{.underline}
That perspective on current events has only strengthened in recent years
as the U.S. global empire has lost power, the United States lost wars in
Asia, and China emerged as the first serious economic competitor against
the United States since at least 1945. The Ukraine war has so far served
mainly to validate and thus harden that perspective.

The U.S.-China conflict has provoked ongoing changes and shifts among
all players in the global economy. [After more than two decades of doing
poorly in competition with China, the United States has shifted from a
policy of neoliberal globalization to one of economic
nationalism]{.underline}. The presidencies of Barack Obama, Donald
Trump, and now Joe Biden illustrate the shift (even as orthodox
economics finds it awkward having celebrated laissez-faire for so long).
Objections from European, Canadian, and other corners flood into
Washington against new U.S. subsidies for automobiles produced inside
the United States. [Those **[self-serving U.S. policies]{.mark}** are
said to **[threaten deindustrialization elsewhere]{.mark}**.
[Europe's]{.mark} traditional subordination to and [alliance
with]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates since 1945 is
[fraying]{.mark}]{.underline}, notwithstanding the loud claims to the
contrary coming from the United States and the EU. The deep economic and
political decline of the UK before and especially after Brexit has the
United States considering reliable, alternative agents for its European
interests. Germany is the likeliest candidate if it could play that role
without jeopardizing its dependence on exports to China. Maneuvers
inside Europe force the UK and each EU member to strategize how best to
respond to them as well as to the United States and China. [Oil and gas
price inflation resulting from the U.S.-EU sanctions against Russia
intensified all these conflicts because they disadvantage Europe
relatively more compared to the other players in the world economy and
also European nations vis-à-vis one another.]{.underline}

Secondary themes distract many from grasping the global reorganization
now underway. Among these are [[principles]{.mark} like **["national
self-determination]{.mark}," "[freedom of]{.mark} the [seas]{.mark},"
and "[rules-based]{.mark} [i]{.mark}nternational [o]{.mark}rder."** They
**[serve]{.mark} mostly to [hide]{.mark} the [global reorganization as
if]{.mark}**, suddenly, such **[principles]{.mark} were the [dominant
reality requiring protection]{.mark}**. The principles, [rather, provide
**convenient**]{.mark} **[veneers]{.mark} for [another period of great
power realignments]{.mark}** like those witnessed in capitalism
before]{.underline}.

Before 1914, contesting capitalisms fought over their respective
colonial possessions amid those capitalisms' shifting relative
strengths. A declining British empire struggled with the major aspiring
contestants to replace that empire (the United States and Germany) and
the minor aspirants (France, Russia, and Japan). Caught up in their
global power struggles were a disintegrating China and a Global South
that was prioritizing decolonization above all else. Within each nation,
class struggles---especially a rising socialism challenging
capitalism---further complicated their external power maneuvers. Those
conflicts culminated in World War I. That war also changed everything:
the global power configuration and, likewise, the internal class
struggles.

The U.S. empire replaced the British empire. The USSR replaced Russia.
Germany's empire was erased. Japan tried to build an Asian empire and
splinter China. Anti-imperialism gained strength everywhere. But so did
the capitalist economic system---the structure of production that
positions a tiny minority of owners/directors---the employers---over a
vast majority of workers---the employees. True, the USSR led global
movements against capitalism, but they mostly focused on displacing
private employers with state officials as employers. For most in that
generation, capitalism meant private employers, whereas socialism meant
state employers. [Capitalism's basic workplace structure---**employers
versus employees---**persisted in both its state and private forms.
**[Capitalism's two forms contested and worked]{.mark} their [profound
influences everywhere]{.mark}, culminating in World War
II.**]{.underline}

Britain, Germany, Japan, and Russia were all deeply damaged and
weakened, leaving the United States to expand and solidify its empire
for the next 75 years. The USSR was strong enough to provide some
counterweight to U.S. military power, chiefly by creating space for the
emergence of replicas of its socialism (state employers rather than
private employers, in conjunction with state-planned distributions
rather than free markets). China took advantage of that space but soon
diverged into its own version of socialism, a hybrid of Soviet-style
state enterprises and private capitalist enterprises, both with similar
employer-employee structures.

Now, yet again, [**[capitalism's contradictions]{.mark} are [driving
toward another war]{.mark}** that would, likely, once again change
everything]{.underline}. But now we can discern a certain pattern that
would likely be repeated, more or less. [An [old empire]{.mark} (**the
United States**) is now clearly **[in decline]{.mark}**, and a [new
one]{.mark} (**China**) is **[emerging]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The only
other potential major power is the EU, but the disunity among its
members greatly weakens its competitiveness relative to the United
States and China. Secondary global powers are Japan and Russia, which
are aligned with the United States and China, respectively. Lagging
behind the major and secondary powers by varying degrees, there are
other countries, including many in the Global South, that have become
economically stronger but whose economic power remains relatively
limited given their own divisions and divisiveness, as some play the
major powers against one another (or try to).

The collapse and disappearance of Eastern European socialism after 1989
and China's major opening to both Chinese and foreign private capitalist
investments in recent decades have combined to produce a broad crisis in
socialism. European social democracy has steadily lost support across
the continent. [**[Neoliberalism]{.mark} had [undermined social
democracy ideologically]{.mark}** even as economic realities provoked
socially divisive immigration, automation, and job exports. Much the
**same had happened in the United States to the center-left**
represented by the Democratic Party, thereby paving the way for Trump.
**[China's rise]{.mark}** has **[challenged]{.mark} the [declining U.S.
empire]{.mark}** and **[provoke]{.mark}d it to [adopt increasingly
desperate economic nationalism in response]{.mark}**]{.underline}**.**
BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) and other related
international blocs reflect and advance the rising strength and voice of
many in the Global South who are moving toward alliances with China and
Russia (accelerated by the Ukraine war and sanctions regime).

Propaganda, trials, and errors characterize efforts by all sides to
navigate a dangerous, tension-filled time of change. One side's "freedom
fighters" are characterized by the opposing side as agents of domination
by major powers. [**[One side's expansion]{.mark} of its international
trade and capital is [branded]{.mark} ["aggressiveness"]{.mark} by
another side rattling its swords**. Shifts from ne**oliberal
globalization to assertive economic nationalism** are all **rationalized
as requirements of** **"national security."**]{.underline} Decades
earlier, devotees of neoliberalism celebrated its contributions to
"peace" by merely existing as a passive contrast to economic nationalism
and its characteristic propensity for wars. The less fantastic
propaganda has its traces of truth, but they are faint. Repression of
internal dissent occurs in all powers, more or less. Efforts by
socialists and other working-class advocates are repressed or barely
tolerated if carefully disconnected from global power politics.

Socialists were split by World War I. On one side were those (Rosa
Luxemburg, Eugene Debs, and Vladimir Lenin) who upheld the primacy of
the anti-capitalist class struggle and transition to a post-capitalist
economic and social system. On the other side were those who took sides
in the global power struggles of capitalist powers and found convenient
socialist-sounding rationales for doing so. World War I split socialists
even as it strengthened a broadly defined socialism. World War II did
the same. It not only hardened the splits within socialism (such as
social democracy and Soviet socialism) but also extended the social
reach of socialist variants of anti-capitalism, especially to the former
colonies and China.

**[[Capitalism]{.mark} has been the [context and ultimate cause of world
history's two worst wars]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Many had thought,
hoped, and worked so that those horrific wars might enable and empower
first the League of Nations and later the United Nations. [The
[goals]{.mark} of these organizations were to **[secure peace]{.mark} in
place of global power politics moving toward war**. They **[tried to
achieve that goal without fundamentally challenging
capitalism]{.mark}**, the **organization of an economy whose production
entails a powerful minority** (private or state) **owning and operating
enterprises**. These organizations seem to have failed, but their
failure left a lesson we can learn and build on.]{.underline}

A **[[truly internationalist socialism]{.mark} would [not
tolerate]{.mark} the [inequalities within]{.mark} and [among]{.mark} the
[nations]{.mark} of the world.]{.underline}** Drastically reducing those
would be the top priority. Providing full guarantees of food, clothing,
and housing for all---across each individual's lifetime---would be the
second-highest priority. Democratizing not only political life (one
person, one vote for all major community decisions) but also economic
life (ensuring each employee has one vote on all major workplace
decisions) would be the third key priority.

A **[[world committed to these goals]{.underline}]{.mark}**---the
concrete meaning of "going beyond capitalism" or "socialism"---[could
**[overcome causes of capitalist wars]{.mark}** and hopefully also of
wars in general]{.underline}.

The global economy is changing.1 After the financial crash of 2008,
world trade declined and has been outpaced by sluggish growth in global
production. The Covid-19 crisis and a fall in commodity prices in March
2020 has since driven the world economy into a slump that is likely to
be more damaging than the Great Recession just over a decade ago. Within
this changing scene, debates have arisen about the growth of
extractivism---the mining and extraction of metals, minerals and oil
from the earth---and the growth of agribusiness, which produces food as
a traded commodity. [The [expropriation of nature]{.mark} is
**[intrinsic to capitalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which as Marx
suggested is [**[driven by profit to rob the soil as well the
worker]{.underline}**.]{.mark}2 There is an [**[obvious link]{.mark}**
between [**climate change** and **investment in extraction of fossil
fuels**]{.mark} through fracking, deep-sea mining, coal mining, oil and
gas drilling, and exploitation of tar sands.]{.underline} The hypocrisy
of our ruling elites is clear. Much favoured for plunder have been the
rare earths, metals and minerals that feed the digital technology
attached to smart phones and computers. Alongside this, intensive and
industrialised forms of agribusiness and monoculture---most notably
production of grain for food and animal feed, and palm oil for
biofuels---have also encouraged states and corporations to engage in
land-grabbing, often in the teeth of opposition from local and
indigenous people. New and sometimes violent struggles have been the
result.

Given these trends many academic and political commentators are
suggesting that the world economy has now entered a new era of
extraction-based accumulation that is reminiscent of earlier colonial
times. This article addresses these debates by examining trends in
global production, trade and investment and their role in the expansion
of mining, monoculture and land-grabs. I compare earlier forms of
colonial or "settler" extraction with the extractivist strategies of
present-day states and assess the significance of these transformations
for understanding contemporary capitalism.

Extractivism, old and new: from primitive accumulation to neoliberalism

**[[Capitalism's propensity to exploit]{.mark} and commodify [the
natural world is nothing new]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It was central to
the "primitive accumulation" of capital described by Marx. [Capitalism's
birth was bound up with European colonial expansion]{.underline},
plunder of foreign lands and land-grabbing from indigenous people. It is
worth quoting Marx at length here. He describes how the shift from the
feudal mode of production to the capitalist one was achieved through
force and drenched in blood:

The discovery of gold and silver in America, the extirpation,
enslavement and entombment in mines of the aboriginal population, the
beginning of the conquest and looting of India and the turning of Africa
into a warren for the commercial hunting of black skins signaled the
rosy dawn of the era of capitalist production. These idyllic proceedings
are the chief moments of primitive accumulation. On their heels treads
the commercial war of the European nations, with the globe as its
battleground. It begins with the revolt of the Netherlands from Spain,
assumes giant dimensions in England's anti-Jacobin war and is still
going on in the opium wars against China.

The different moments of primitive accumulation can be assigned in
particular to Spain, Portugal, Holland, France and England, more or less
in chronological order. In England at the end of the 17th century, they
arrive at a systematical combination, embracing the colonies, the
national debt, the modern mode of taxation and the protectionist system.
These methods depend in part on brute force, for example, the colonial
system. But, they all employ the power of the state, the concentrated
and organised force of society, to hasten, hot-house fashion, the
process of transformation of the feudal mode of production into the
capitalist mode, and to shorten the transition. Force is the midwife of
every old society pregnant with a new one. It is itself an economic
power.3

The [[rush to monopolise]{.underline}]{.mark} natural resources was
[[integral to]{.mark} the [commodification of]{.mark} the [natural
world]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Primary products became the fuel for the
process of production, whether coal for steam power, oil for motor
vehicles and aeroplanes or lithium for today's batteries.]{.underline}4
In many cases, [[colonised societies]{.mark} were [restructured
by]{.mark} the [imperial powers]{.mark} as sources of primary
commodities]{.underline}, blocking the possibility of independent
industrial development. The transport infrastructures of conquered
nations were designed to extract raw materials from the interior to
ports so that they could be shipped to the metropoles to be processed.
The prior economic development of these societies was reversed when they
were flooded with cheap industrial products from Europe.

Capitalism's inherent dynamic of competition and ever-expanding cycle of
accumulation meant a search for, and plunder of, whatever primary
products could be mined, farmed or fished. [The bonds between humans and
nature]{.underline} that are essential to our existence---what Engels
referred to as the "metabolic interchange"---was [put under enormous
strain by capitalism and a great "metabolic rift"]{.underline} with
nature has followed.5 The breakdown of the relationship between humans
and the natural world remains a consistent theme as we pass from old to
new forms of extractivism.

The consolidation of the power of capital on all continents throughout
the 18th and 19th centuries led to a huge expansion of world trade in
primary commodities and manufactured goods---a first wave of
"globalisation". However, this process fell back as rival imperialisms
fought out their differences in the First World War. Britain was the
dominant power during this first wave due to its early
industrialisation.

A [second wave of globalisation]{.underline}, that of our current
period, has been framed by two key factors: the [United States' hegemony
since the Second World War]{.underline} and the [declining profit rates
of Western corporations since the end of the 1960s]{.underline}. It is
against this backdrop that the so-called "Washington consensus" emerged.
This "consensus" created a pact between Western corporations, their
"home" states and international financial institutions such as the World
Bank, the World Trade Organisation and the International Monetary Fund
(IMF). They worked together to break down trade barriers, dissolve fixed
exchange rates and bully "Third World" nation states that had attempted
to develop their own home-grown industrial base through import
substitution of key manufacturing goods during the 1950s and 1960s.6 The
goal was to [open up new markets and source cheaper labour in the Global
South]{.underline} in order to [reverse the declining profitability of
Western capital.]{.underline}

To achieve this end neoliberal [globalisation emphasised **[national
economies]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[becoming
[export-orientated]{.mark}]{.underline}**, based on trade theories from
classical bourgeois economics that extol the virtues of "comparative
advantage". The concept of comparative advantage stems from the theories
of David Ricardo, the 19th century British political economist. He
suggested that [countries should specialise in the specific goods or
services that they were able to produce most efficiently due to the
presence of natural resources, labour efficiencies and other
factors]{.underline}. According to Ricardo, as long as trade was "free"
and without tariffs, then specialisation and comparative advantage would
create a more efficient and effective system of world trade. More
recently, the theory has been augmented by Eli Heckscher and Bertil
Ohlin, who argue that an "equilibrium" is created on world markets by
migration of capital, feeding industries that utilise comparative
advantage and starving those that are inefficient.7 Based on this logic,
the international financial institutions emphasised capital accumulation
strategies focused on world trade and frictionless cross-border
financial transactions. In practice, this meant the elimination of
import tariffs and exchange rate controls. This shift led to a
[**[deepening of exploitation]{.mark}** around the world]{.underline}
and a new global [**[division of labour]{.mark}** that fitted into
transnational global supply chains of everything from food to
microchips]{.underline}. The expropriation and commodification of the
natural world and its resources was part and parcel of these changes.
The [World Bank encouraged extractivism by rewriting mining
codes]{.underline}, and regulatory reforms transformed the rules
surrounding taxation, royalties, the repatriation of capital across
borders, licensing and the environment.8

Nation states, especially in the Global South, began to specialise in
primary and agricultural products for sale on the world market as a
result. The previous relative sustainability of locally produced food
and manufactured goods gave way to monoculture and large-scale
agribusiness. For example, tropical rainforests in Malaysia and
Indonesia were uprooted and replaced by palm forests for palm oil or
biodiesel. The [**[environmental impact]{.mark} has been
[dreadful]{.mark}**: [soil]{.mark} is [degraded]{.mark}, [water]{.mark}
is [polluted]{.mark}, wildlife is endangered and
[g]{.mark}reen[h]{.mark}ouse [g]{.mark}a[s]{.mark} emissions
[increase]{.mark} as peatlands are destroyed.]{.underline}9 As with the
earlier period of colonial extractivism, force played a role in the
process. In Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Colombia indigenous
populations were driven out or suppressed.10 The story is similar in
Ivory Coast and Ghana, which once boasted varied and sustainable
agriculture but are now both dependent on cocoa monoculture. Two-thirds
of the world's cocoa is now produced in these two West African
countries, where the industry is dependent on child labour and has
caused massive deforestation.11 This is not to say that all
"non-western" countries were impoverished or subordinated in the process
of developing extraction. Often their elites prospered as individuals,
and their wealth and power allowed them to dominate their own
populations. The enrichment of elites in the Gulf states by oil revenue
and the development of the Arabian Peninsula as a new centre of capital
accumulation is a good example of this.12

[[Neoliberal measures]{.mark} have undoubtedly [**paved the way**
for]{.mark} a **[resurgence of investment in
extraction]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The shift towards export orientation,
comparative advantage and free trade has encouraged countries in the
Global South to move away from earlier attempts at "import
substitution"---efforts to establish "home-grown" industry---and focus
instead on natural resources as a dollar earner. Table 1 illustrates the
degree to which many countries in the Global South have become dependent
on the export of primary products and commodities when compared to
northern industrialised states.

\<\<table omitted\>\>

Although China has joined Global North countries such as Britain, the US
and Japan in focusing on manufacturing exports, countries in Latin
America such as Uruguay, Chile, Brazil and Argentina are heavily
dependent on primary products. However, some Global North countries such
as Australia and Canada are relatively dependent on fuel and minerals.
These variations are discussed in more detail later in this article.

Data on foreign direct investment (FDI) also confirms a trend towards
extractivism, despite investment generally contracting since the 2007-8
financial crash. Figures produced by United Nations Conference on Trade
and Development (UNCTAD) in its annual World Investment Report indicate
a substantial three-year fall in FDI totals. A 23 percent fall in 2017
was followed by a further 13 percent fall in 2018, and FDI flatlined in
2019.13 However, FDI flows to Africa rose by 11 percent between 2017 and
2019, and this points to a bigger picture. Data about new greenfield
projects (in which corporations actually set up new operations in a
foreign country rather than just buying up existing companies) shows a
big leap in investment in extractive industries compared to
manufacturing and services. For example, between 2017 and 2018
greenfield investment in coke and refined petroleum products jumped by
480 percent, from \$15 billion to \$86 billion. Investment in mining,
quarrying and petroleum doubled from \$20 billion to \$41 billion. Over
the same period greenfield investment in all manufacturing rose at a
much slower rate of 35 percent and services by 43 percent (much of it
linked to digitalisation and new technologies). This has occurred while
investment declined in those sectors that had performed best in the
years of peak globalisation. For example, FDI fell by 3 percent in
electrical and electronic equipment, and by 36 percent in textiles.14
Overall the inflows of new investment (including deepwater exploration)
to "developing" or "emerging" countries in West and Central Africa, for
example, have been accelerating. Investment has poured into
oil-exporting countries such as Nigeria and projects such as the
Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline.15

Extraction of fossil fuels is still a major destination for FDI. The
largest projects worldwide receiving new externally-sourced investment
include an alliance of petroleum companies led by Shell to build a
liquefied natural gas export facility in Canada, a project by the French
oil and gas giant Total to construct a petrochemical complex in Jubail,
Saudi Arabia and a project by the Taiwanese company CNC to establish a
petrochemical plant in Paradip, India.16 Outside of these continuing
major investments in fossil fuels there has also been a rise in new
investment in renewable energy. This investment is in fact greater in
total than new investment in non-renewable energy production. However,
[this is [still **far below**]{.mark} the [levels]{.mark} demanded by
the United Nations' [**"sustainable development goals"** to **combat
climate change and replace fossil fuels
completely**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Capital has been facing both ways in
the debate on climate change, supporting both renewables and fossil
fuels. Governments are also seeking to encourage resource exploitation
by rolling back protective environmental measures aimed at fossil fuels
and the associated industrial sectors. This is especially the case in
Donald Trump's US, where the government has relieved car manufacturers
from meeting pollution standards under cover of the Covid-19 crisis,
handed huge bail-outs to airlines and backed the criminalisation of
climate protests in three states.17

Of course, the [financial incentive to invest in extraction is highly
dependent on commodity prices]{.underline}. FDI is higher risk than
domestic investment because it is subject to exchange rate fluctuations,
speculation on future demand and political volatility. Nevertheless, the
rewards can be great. Rates of return on investment in extractive
industries are certainly greater than investment in the manufacturing
sector, where rates of profitability are historically low.18 High
commodity prices and low profitability in other sectors stimulate FDI in
extraction as money from venture capitalists, sovereign wealth funds and
corporate finance searches for a home. However, [commodity prices since
the financial crash have proved extremely volatile, throwing doubt and
confusion into "extractivist" state strategies]{.underline}. The
Covid-19 crisis made things much worse, plunging commodity prices
further downwards. This administered a major shock to the fossil fuel
industry; oil prices fell by over a third in March 2020 to a price of
\$20 dollars a barrel or less, the lowest level in 18 years. Metal
prices also fell by up to 10 percent in the same month, and the only
commodity that recorded an increase was fertilizer.19 Bizarrely, oil
companies were forced temporarily to give away their product because it
is too expensive to shut down oil wells and storage capacity is limited.
Others were desperate to sell their oil at knockdown prices to China,
which emerged from a first wave of coronavirus into a buyers' market.20
Poorer oil producing countries such as Nigeria, Ecuador and Venezuela
will be severely hit by these falling prices. The sharp decline in
commodity prices may mean all previous trends in the world economy being
thrown into doubt. [Indeed, there is evidence that the **["emerging

**[[Capitalism]{.mark} drives and is [linked to climate change at every
level]{.mark}]{.underline}**. There is an important historical argument
that our economic dependence on fossil fuels came about not due to the
availability of natural resources nor for technological reasons but
because it suited the needs of capitalism. Andreas Malm in his important
study Fossil Capital: The Rise of Steam Power and the Roots of Global
Warming \[16\] has shown that during the Industrial Revolution steam
power based on coal was adopted in preference to waterpower because it
facilitated capitalist exploitation. There is also the powerful
argument, both scientific and political, that the origins of a new
geological age, the Anthropocene, characterised by a total environmental
crisis including climate change, corresponds to the immense global
capitalist boom after the Second World War. \[17\] Hence the 'hockey
stick' shaped graphs for so many natural and social phenomena ranging
from C02 in the atmosphere to ocean acidification, urban population and
international tourism. \[18\]

However, the angle from which I want to approach this issue is the
simple question: why have our rulers, the world's governments and
politicians left it so long to even begin seriously addressing the issue
of climate change when it would have been so much easier to tackle it
earlier? Here there are a number of parallels. What would happen to a
doctor whose patient was diagnosed with cancer and who knowingly ignored
the diagnosis, fobbing the patient off with paracetamol, until they were
almost at death's door? They would certainly be struck off and probably
subject to criminal prosecution. Or what about a shipping company that
had an ocean liner which they knew was not seaworthy and most likely
would not make the Atlantic crossing for which it was scheduled, but
nonetheless gambled on sending it out at the cost of two thousand lives?
That company would be guilty at the least of corporate manslaughter.
These examples can be repeated for cars, planes, bridges and so on. Yet
the fact is that what our rulers have done regarding climate change has
been worse than any of these in terms of its consequences for humanity
and animal species. They have, already, guaranteed the death of millions
of people and the extinction of thousands of species.

Let's be clear about how long they have known about the problem. The
possibility of the greenhouse effect was first understood in 1896, by
the Swedish scientist, Svante Arhenhuis, but it was not considered
practically significant. The fact that some global warming was actually
occurring was first measured in the 1930s, but it was assumed to be on
too minute a scale to worry about. This started to change in the 1950s
with the work of Guy Stewart Callender and in the 1960s David Keeling
demonstrated that human-generated greenhouse emissions were large enough
to cause global warming. \[19\] By the late 1970s there was already a
degree of scientific consensus on this. The simple fact that the UN
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was established in 1988
by the World Meteorological Organisation and the UN Environment
Programme, and issued its first report in 1990, testifies to the fact
that every serious government and political leader has known about the
problem for at least thirty years. In 1992 the UN Framework Convention
on Climate Change (UNFCCC), at the Rio Earth Summit, committed states to
reduce gas emissions 'based on the then scientific consensus'.
Scientific evidence from [Greenland ice cores meant by the end of the
1990s scientists knew they were looking not just at gradual warming but
the [**real possibility** of **rapid and catastrophic warming**
should]{.mark} certain thresholds or [tipping points]{.mark} be
[crossed]{.mark}]{.underline}. \[20\] In other words, our so-called
[['**world leaders'**]{.mark} **and governments**, almost without
exception, have been [knowingly **gambling with**]{.mark} **the [lives
of hundreds of millions]{.mark}** of people for decades]{.underline}.
Their deep guilt is undeniable, but the question is why?

One answer might be that these [politicians]{.underline} simply don't
give a damn -- they [care only about themselves]{.underline}, [their
careers and the pockets they can line.]{.underline} But even if this
were true it wouldn't explain why politicians and governments would not
consider it in their own interest, politically as well as for their
children, to do something serious about climate change in the same way
that the British ruling class decided it was in their interest to
abolish the slave trade in 1833 or the US government decided it had to
abolish slavery in order to win the Civil War or, a century later, to
pass civil rights legislation.

An answer to that might be that there have been no votes in tackling
climate change because 'people' didn't care about it. But people didn't
care because they didn't understand it. This, of course, can be laid at
the door of the media. The responsibility of the media is clear. For
decades they colluded with corporate funded climate denial to treat
climate change as just 'a theory' and invariably to 'balance' scientific
testimony with climate scepticism. If they no longer do that (in Ireland
and the UK, as opposed to the US and elsewhere) they still don't treat
climate change as a real 'crisis', like Brexit or an economic crash, but
relegate it to the inside pages, and they still refuse to link
ever-increasing extreme weather events to climate change. However, the
media is not a stand-alone independent force in this: a) the media is
largely owned and controlled by people, like Rupert Murdoch and Denis
O'Brien, who are an integral part of the ruling elites; b) the media,
especially the news media, takes its cue to a huge extent from
governments and leading politicians. All it would have required to get
the media to change their agenda would have been a few concerted
statements and appeals from 'world leaders'. So, we are back to our
question as to why those leaders have refused to do this.

The compelling [answer is]{.mark} that **[[tackling climate
change]{.mark} consistently [clashed with]{.mark} the [interests and
priorities of capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the imperative of
profit. At every stage, and still today, [our [**leaders have found**
that **even when**]{.mark} **they ["sincerely" wanted to do what was
necessary]{.mark}** [to **avert climate breakdown**]{.mark} this
**[conflicted with]{.mark} the [immediate needs of ']{.mark}**the
**[economy']{.mark}** i.e. capitalism and they invariably **chose the
[latter over]{.mark} the [former]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This applied
whether it was Enda Kenny, George Bush, Bill Clinton or Barack Obama
(never mind **[Donald [Trump]{.mark}]{.underline}**), Tony Blair, David
Cameron, Nicolas Sarkozy , Emmanuel Macron, **[Vladimir
[Putin]{.mark}]{.underline}** or **[[Xi]{.mark} Jinping]{.underline}**.

Understanding this involves understanding not so much how climate change
works as how capitalism works. \[21\] For capitalist businesses the
[[profit imperative]{.mark} is [not just]{.mark} a [need for]{.mark} a
reasonable ['return']{.mark}]{.underline} (as they often claim) but a
**[[drive to maximise profit]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Nor is it just a
matter of personal greed, an insatiable desire for more luxury cars,
yachts or private jets. It is an [**objective pressure** **deriving
from** the **very nature of the capitalist system**]{.underline} -- not
just the ideology of neoliberalism -- which dominates every enterprise
and unit within it. This is because **[capitalism is based on
competition in the market]{.underline},** ultimately the world market,
and the [measure of **success** in that competition **is the amount of
profit realised**]{.underline}**.** This operates at every level from
the local corner shop to the giant multinational corporation. To put it
concretely SPAR is competing with Centra, Volkswagen is competing with
Toyota and General Motors, and ExxonMobile is competing with BP and
Shell, and if they do not keep up in the race, the race for profit, they
will go out of business and get taken over. Crucially -- for responding
to climate change -- this operates not just at the level of states but
also internationally between capitalist states, between the USA and
China; Russia and the EU; Brazil and India and so on in an endless
struggle of all against all.

At a national level this relentless competition is partially mitigated
by the existence of the state (not just parliament but the civil
service, judiciary, police, armed forces etc.). One of the functions of
the capitalist state, along with repression, is to provide services and
infrastructure (schools, hospitals, roads, transport etc.) required by
the capitalist economy as a whole, which it may not be in the interests
of private businesses to maintain. But no such overarching authority
exists at the international level. \[22\] Internationally each
capitalist state acts on behalf of its own capitalist class in the
global competition. Thus, not only each business but also each state is
under an iron compulsion to grow its economy at a rate that matches its
rivals.

The final piece in this capitalist jigsaw is the [**[central role played
by fossil-fuel]{.mark}** and fossil fuel [related corporations
in]{.mark} the **[global capitalist economy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
likes of Shell, BP, ExxonMobile, Texaco, Toyota, Volkswagen and General
Motors are among the biggest in the world and they all exercise a huge
influence on government. It should be remembered that US Vice President
Dick Cheney, the brains behind George W, Bush, was an executive of the
oil company, Halliburton and that Trump's first Secretary of State was
Rex Tillerson, former CEO of ExxonMobile. But it should also be
understood that the objective weight of these companies in the world
economy gives them immense political leverage even without such direct
personal influence.

As a result of these combined pressures the prioritisation of profit
over the environment and over human life becomes second nature to both
business executives and mainstream politicians and state officials. US
Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, is pleased the Arctic is melting. In
May this year, with dollar-signs flashing in his eyes, he stated:

'The [Arctic is at the forefront of opportunity and
abundance]{.underline}. It houses 13 percent of the world's undiscovered
oil, 30 percent of its undiscovered gas, an abundance of uranium, rare
earth minerals, gold, diamonds, and millions of square miles of untapped
resources and fisheries galore. Steady reductions in sea ice are opening
new passageways and new opportunities for trade. This could potentially
slash the time it takes to travel between Asia and the West by as much
as 20 days. Arctic sea lanes could become the 21st century Suez and
Panama Canals. \[23\]

The point here is not how outrageous but how normal this is. 'They'
might not all say it so openly, but it is how the large majority of them
think. It [requires immense popular mobilisation]{.underline}, on a much
greater scale than anything yet achieved by Extinction Rebellion or
Fridays For Future or anybody else to force them to even contemplate any
other way of operating and when that does happen their 'change of heart'
is only temporary, to get the threat of the popular movement to go away
before returning to profit-driven business-as-usual.

This is why [[capitalism and pro-capitalist politicians]{.mark} have
[done]{.mark} next to [nothing to stop climate
change]{.mark}]{.underline}; this is why they have been prepared to
sacrifice millions of lives and millions of species and gamble with the
future of the planet. \[23a\] That is what [they [have done for
decades]{.mark}]{.underline} and, in many cases, for centuries, what
[they are [still doing]{.mark} now [and will continue]{.mark} to do in
the future]{.underline}. And this doesn't just mean they're not doing
enough; it means [they are actively intervening to prevent serious
action being taken]{.underline}, just as Leo Varadkar and Fine Gael did
in Ireland by using behind-the-scenes parliamentary manoeuvres to block
Brid Smith's Climate Emergency Measures Bill, and as Obama did at the
Copenhagen Earth Summit in 2009 and Trump has done by pulling the US out
of the 2015 Paris Accords. Trump's statement on this summed it all up in
a single sentence: 'The Paris Accord will undermine our economy'.

This explanation of what has already happened in the immediate past
provides us with the best guide as to what will happen in the immediate
future. Even if, by some extraordinary and most unlikely miracle,
substantial sections of the global business and political elite were to
have a collective Damascene conversion to environmentalism, there would
be no way, by their methods, they could turn around the immense oil
tanker of the global economy in the very short time we have to avert
disaster. This is why we need **['[System change not climate
change']{.mark}]{.underline}**.

#### Under capitalism, it is impossible to create sustainable climate change solutions -- capitalist, world leaders never act

**Brooks '06** \[Mick; August 21; economist, educator, and activist;
marxist.com; "Capitalism and the Environment";
https://www.marxist.ca/article/capitalism-and-the-environment\]

Here's the reason. If the price of oil doubles to \$77 a barrel (which
it is at the time of writing), a whole lot of oil reserves suddenly
become economically viable -- profitable -- to exploit. At half the
price (oil was \$35 a barrel not so long ago) they are not reserves at
all. That's capitalism for you! [[For decades scientists have known how
to extract oil from bituminous shale. But under capitalism it's not
economic to extract it]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Even if we accept the argument that we are up against limited resources
now, what should be our response? Malthus, as an apologist for the rich,
cleverly eliminated the inequalities in our society from his analysis.
Surely the first thing we should do is to eliminate the luxury spending
of the rich, which gobbles up a disproportionate amount of earth's
resources? The second thing we should do is run a worldwide inventory to
establish exactly how much we have of all these resources.

Then [[we should look into producing and adopting
alternatives]{.underline}]{.mark}. We need to sit down and think very
hard about the alternatives to burning fossil fuels as an energy source.
[[We can't do this under capitalism]{.mark}, partly because of the
vested interests]{.underline}, such as the hydrocarbon capitalist in the
White House, that dominate decision-making in most capitalist states.
[[Dominant sections of the capitalist class are actually CO2-burning
junkies.]{.underline}]{.mark} The other problem is that wind and wave
power and other [[sustainable]{.underline}]{.mark} energy [[sources are
not taken seriously by capitalists who can't find a way of making money
out of them]{.mark}.]{.underline} Therefore not enough research has been
done on their viability. Finally, if absolutely necessary, we should
implement a fair system of rationing until the alternatives come on
stream.

[How can we do this under capitalism? We can't.]{.underline} The price
mechanism praised by economists is essentially reactive. When the price
of petrol goes up, people will buy more fuel-efficient cars. But the
fact that oil prices have gone up is actually a signal that capitalism
has been squandering the earth's resources. Our action plan on the
environment is really a plan for world socialism.

Won't world capitalism do something about the mess it has created in the
meantime? Even the imperialists under siege in Mafeking introduced
rationing (communism in consumption) for the duration in order to
survive.

They might. But the example of overfishing shows the problems. **[The
capitalist state is captive to capitalist vested
interests]{.underline}**: the shipbuilding industry and the fishing
industry cry out for subsidies. Competition, which involves the weakest
going to the wall, is fine in the textbooks, but it's not for the likes
of them. [[Capitalist countries fight each other more viciously as
resources become more difficult to grab.]{.underline}]{.mark} African
countries have little muscle against the European Union's trawling
fleet.

Outside the flat-earthers in the White House, there is a consensus that
global warming is a big problem -- actually the biggest environmental
problem the world faces by far. [The capitalist powers]{.mark} met at
Kyoto and came to an agreement. The USA opted out. But America, with
less than 5% of the world's population, is responsible for a quarter of
all carbon emissions[.]{.underline} So that makes the Accord pretty much
meaningless. But a lot of those [countries [that agreed to the Kyoto
targets to cut the increase in]{.mark} [emissions]{.mark} (not cut
emissions) have [failed to meet them]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[It is
actually quite difficult for a capitalist state to control the
activities of tens of thousands of capitalist firms who are responsible
for giving off CO2]{.mark}.]{.underline} And everybody agrees that Kyoto
will not solve the problem. It is [usually [described as a 'first step',
and that **first step has never** ]{.mark}**really [been
taken]{.mark}**]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}**

So **[[world socialism really is the only way we can protect the
environment]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in other words our home, the planet
earth.

I[s climate change a mythlike issue we just hear about? **Unfortunately
not**;]{.underline} it's an urgent crisis with current tangible
implications. Although melting ice caps and rising sea levels get most
of the media attention, it's as essential to understand the societal
causes of climate change.

[**[Capitalism]{.mark}**, a **system that [encourages continuous growth
and consumption]{.mark}**, is a **major cause** of this
issue]{.underline}, according to scholars like Andreas Malm and John
Urry. [Even though capitalism is one of the major causes of economic
growth that improved the general quality of life, it's **res[ponsible
for excessive consumption, resource exploitation,]{.mark} and [increased
g]{.mark}reenhouse [g]{.mark}as [emissions]{.mark}**, which reverse
capitalism's positive effects.]{.underline} Therefore, significant
societal changes are needed to address climate change than just
technological solutions.

The Capitalist Challenge

Let us imagine capitalism as a magician casting spells to grow the
economy. According to sociologist John Urry, [the growth and
**profit-reliant [capitalist system]{.mark}** has [put us in]{.mark} a
**[chokehold of high emissions and environmental harm]{.mark}**,
likening the effects to a **"sorcerer who can no longer control their
spells"**.]{.underline} He also points out a major problem, relying on
international trade and transportation, the "mobility complex" as a
contributing factor. From this, [we can comprehend that **[as long as
economic growth]{.mark} is [prioritized]{.mark}, it will have a [U-turn
effect]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Hence, sustainability should be the
critical focus where the magician regains control over the spells of
growth contributing to climate crisis before it's too late.

Are We Living in the "Sociocene"?

An Anthropocene problem, something climate change is often associated
with, where human activity is the cause of environmental impact.
However, [some believe it's **[not humanity as a whole to
blame]{.mark}** **but** **certain [socioeconomic
practices]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is argued by Andreas Malm and Alf
Hornberg where the term "Sociocene" implies [[c]{.mark}limate
[c]{.mark}hange [arose from human behaviors]{.mark} within the
capitalist economy]{.underline} (Malm &Hornberg, 2014). An example is
industrialized countries emitting more than others and wealthier groups
are disproportionately responsible. The richest 10% of the earth's
population contributes almost half of all emissions, while the poorest
50% contribute less than 10%​. The "Sociocene" is backed by the sharp
divide in the data which shows climate change isn't a universal issue
but one rooted in socioeconomic inequalities.

Climate Change and Social Inequality

While widespread, [climate change [effects aren't distributed
equally]{.mark}. Communities and [countries with]{.mark} the [least
resources]{.mark} and [lowest carbon emissions]{.mark} are frequently
the **[most at risk]{.mark} from [climate-driven migration, food
shortages,]{.mark} and [extreme weather]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Richer,
high-emission countries, which can make big changes, often ignore this
inequity. Instead, [they **[favor economic expansion over global climate
responsibilities]{.mark}**. Even though they contribute very little to
global emissions, the UN says **poorer nations are the most at
risk**]{.underline}. The moral need for systemic change is demonstrated
by the fact that richer countries can protect themselves from the
effects of climate change while vulnerable ones are left to suffer the
most. [Continuing with "business as usual" keeps this imbalance ongoing
and reinforces the need for high-emission countries to lead in
meaningful climate action.]{.underline}

Can Capitalism Be Sustainable?

A growing trend advocates [**"[green growth]{.mark}**," a modified form
of capitalism to maintain environmental sustainability, poverty
reduction, and social inclusivity]{.underline}. Advocates of the
ecological modernization theory, such as Fredrick Buttel, argue that
capitalism should aim for "sustainable growth". [This would consist of
reorganizing industries and promoting new environmentally friendly
technologies]{.underline}. However, critics say that **[green capitalism
[doesn't address]{.mark} the [core issue]{.mark}, the [capitalist drive
for expansion itself]{.mark}]{.underline}**. According to Urry and Beck,
[more than technical solutions are needed to address climate change
because they frequently [increase consumption rather than
decrease]{.mark} it. Electric cars, for instance, may cut emissions, but
they also require a lot of lithium mining, which has environmental
implications. They contend that our **[economic institutions]{.mark}
must be [restructured to prioritize ecological health over
profit]{.mark} to [achieve true sustainability.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Climate Change as a "Risk Society"

Ulrich Beck's "risk society" theory helps us comprehend how we deal with
modernity's unexpected effects. As a result of technical progress, new
types of hazards, such as nuclear disasters and climate change, appear
in a risk society. These contemporary hazards are frequently worldwide,
persistent, and uncontrollable, in contrast to conventional threats. [He
advocates changing the structures which these dangers arise from,
referred to as "reflexive modernization".]{.underline}

Economic priorities redefined

[We as a society need to [evaluate]{.mark} our [connection with]{.mark}
the [environment]{.mark} to [maintain]{.mark} a **[sustainable, healthy
planet]{.mark}**, which is the **[core that economic growth cannot exist
without]{.mark}**. There must be a **[departure from capitalism's
"growth at all costs" philosophy]{.mark}** as it is
[self-destructive]{.mark}]{.underline}; just like a bodybuilder on
testosterone, the initial results are impressive until the side effects
arise, depriving the body of certain vital functions. [Earth must be
maintained as it's the economy's existential core and main limiting
factor. We need to be an aware society that acts as the controlling hand
of the "sorcerer's wand" by holding companies responsible for their
carbon footprint and pressuring governments to apply climate change
legislation.]{.underline}

[[Wildlife populations]{.mark} have [crashed by 69%]{.mark}]{.underline}
over the past 50 years (Davis, 2022) as an almost direct result of
capitalism which I will further expand upon in this article.
[[Capitalism]{.mark} by its [very nature drives **environmental
destruction**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is because the main objective
of businesses that operate under capitalism is to maximise profits for
their shareholders, even if it's at the expense of the environment and
the species in which inhabit it. Capitalism's need for [[continuous
**growth**]{.mark}, which can be compared to that of a
treadmill (Schnaiberg, 1980), has led to the [extraction of **finite**
resources]{.mark} on a massive scale, often prioritising profit above
all else]{.underline}. This can be seen through an abundance of
examples, such as the continued destruction of the Amazon rainforest by
companies such as the Brazilian mining empire Vale who extracted more
than 4 billion tonnes of iron ore from the Carajás mines (Jonathan
Watts, 2023). Such mining operations demand extensive land use, leading
to significant deforestation. The deforestation required for these
operations [[endangers]{.mark} countless plant and animal
[species]{.mark}]{.underline} as well as [[disrupting]{.mark} the
[**indigenous** communities]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Amazon rainforest
houses over 3 million species of plants and animals and one million
indigenous people all of which are essential to the functionality of the
rainforest (Santos, 2024). They help stabilise the ecosystem, maintain
food chains, and support species that depend on each other. In
addition, the amazon rainforest provides 9% of the world's
oxygen (Nevres, 2023) and practices like deforestation are major
contributors to climate change as deforestation releases stored carbon
into the atmosphere and mining activities themselves generate an
abundance of carbon emissions accelerating the climate crisis and
contributing to the [[rising temperatures **disrupting
ecosystems**]{.underline}]{.mark} worldwide.

While capitalism has increased the standard of living for millions of
people, it has done so at the expense of nature. Wildlife has been
negatively impacted so much in the past 500 years, human activity has
led to 500 species of land animals going extinct, a rate that has caused
scientists to warn of a sixth mass extinction (Carey, 2015). Some may
argue that climate change is a natural phenomenon and that humans are
not to blame but the scientific evidence has demonstrated that human
behaviour is the main driver of climate change (Swim JK, 2011). [[**We
are responsible** for]{.mark} the current [mass **extinction**]{.mark}
of species and the [**suffering** of animals]{.mark}, whether that is
from rising temperatures which is disrupting the ecosystems to habitat
destruction caused by resource extraction]{.underline}. As habitats
shrink and ecosystems degrade, countless species struggle to survive and
are often forced to migrate. This is seen with overfishing. Overfishing
is when too many fish are taken out of the ocean creating an imbalance
that can erode the food chain and lead to a [[loss of]{.mark} important
[marine life]{.mark}]{.underline}, including vulnerable species like sea
turtles and corals (World Wild life, 2024). Ultimately the chain
reaction put into motion by [[capitalism]{.mark}'s relentless pursuit of
profit]{.underline} is not just an economic or class issue, but also a
[[profound threat]{.mark} to our planet's biodiversity and overall
stability]{.underline}. Corporations have known of the threat for quite
some time but have completely ignored it as sustainable practices are
viewed as more costly and less profitable. For example, in 1995 Royal
Dutch Shell planned to sink the Brent Spar oil platform in the North
Atlantic as a low-cost method of disposal (Weyler, 2016). However, this
would have negatively impacted the ocean's ecosystem, potentially
releasing toxic substances that could harm marine life and disrupt
delicate ecological balances that are present within oceans. Capitalism
often blames consumers for how much climate change has progressed in the
last hundred years. For example, there are massive programmes for
household waste recycling, creating the illusion that consumer choices
are the main drivers of environmental damages. Meanwhile, there is a
lack of government funding or policies to ensure major corporations
adopt green energy solutions of sustainable practices even though since
1988 just 100 companies have been the source of more than 70% of the
world's greenhouse gas emissions (Riley, 2017). [We must act
now]{.underline} if we want our precious animals and wildlife to live as
they once did, free from the [threat of [extinction caused by climate
change]{.mark}]{.underline} which is at its tipping point, beyond which
there is no redemption (Hansen, 2008). What can we do? First, make it a
priority in your life to contribute to organisations dedicated to
wildlife conservation through either a financial contribution or
donating your time. An example of one of these organisations is the
World Wildlife Fund (WWF). Second, we should use sustainably sourced
products, and avoid products made from endangered species. Finally, we
must Protest and make our voices heard. Raising awareness and bringing
negative media attention about what these multinational organisations
are destroying in the pursuit of profit can help prevent them from
continuing their ways as demonstrated by the Greenpeace activists who
occupied the Brent Spar, sparking a media campaign and preventing the
oil platform from being horribly disposed of in the ocean.

All over the world, far-right, authoritarian and semi-fascist forces are

Authoritarian policies and oligarchs form a powerful alliance to

Capital triumphs, but its triumph plunges it into the insurmountable
contradictions highlighted by Marx. Faced with these, Rosa [[Luxembourg
issued]{.underline}]{.mark} her [[warning]{.underline}]{.mark} in 1915:
"[[Socialism or barbarism]{.underline}]{.mark}". One hundred and ten
years later, sounding the alarm is more urgent than ever, as the
catastrophe growing around us is unprecedented. To the [plagues of [war,
colonialism, exploitation, racism, authoritarianism,
oppression]{.mark}]{.underline}s of all kinds, is added a new scourge,
which exacerbates all the others: the [[accelerated

#### Capitalism has fueled inequalities between developing countries and severely reduced the standard of living through carbon-fueled capitalism.

The scholarship on the matter is clear: [Western [countries have
benefited]{.mark}]{.underline} inordinately [[from]{.underline}]{.mark}
both [colonialism and [carbon]{.mark}]{.underline} fuel [[to
attain]{.underline}]{.mark} their level of
[[development]{.underline}]{.mark}. The data from the Global Carbon
Project, which was headed by the US Department of Energy's now defunct
Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Centre, shows that the
[[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has been]{.mark}]{.underline} far and
away [the [largest producer of carbon]{.mark} dioxide [emissions]{.mark}
since 1750]{.underline}. By itself, the United States has emitted more
CO2 than the entire European Union, twice as much as China, and eight
times more than India. The main carbon emitters were all colonial
powers, namely the US, Europe, Canada, and Australia, which, despite
consisting of roughly one tenth of the global population, have together
accounted for more than half of cumulative global emissions. From the
18th century on, these [[countries]{.underline}]{.mark} have not only
dispensed the bulk of the carbon in the atmosphere, but they continue to
[[exceed]{.mark} their [share of]{.mark} the [global carbon
budget]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Carbon]{.mark}-fuelled
[capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}, enriched by the wealth stolen through
colonialism, [has [enabled]{.mark}]{.underline} the [countries of
[Europe and North America to enhance]{.mark} the well-being of their
[populations]{.mark} [and attain]{.mark} their relatively [advanced
level of development]{.mark}]{.underline}. The extreme [[inequalities
between]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[standard of living
for]{.underline}]{.mark} the average [[European]{.underline}]{.mark}
(748 million people) [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the average
[[Indian]{.underline}]{.mark} (1.4 billion people) [[is seven times
greater]{.mark} than]{.underline} it was [a century ago]{.underline}.
Though the [[reliance by]{.underline}]{.mark} China, India, and other
[[developing countries on carbon]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly
coal, [[has risen]{.underline}]{.mark} to a high level, their per capita
emissions continue to remain far below those of the
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, whose [per
capita [emissions]{.mark}]{.underline} are close to
[[twice]{.underline}]{.mark} that [of]{.underline}
[[China's]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[eight times]{.mark} more than
[India's]{.mark}]{.underline}. The lack of acknowledgment of climate
imperialism leads to a failure to properly resource the Green Climate
Fund, which was created in 2010 at COP 16 with the aim of helping
developing countries 'leapfrog' carbon-fuelled social development.

#### Industrial agriculture, shaped by capitalism, only sees certain animals and species as having value or being "natural assets", ignoring biodiversity loss caused by large institutions.

[[Industrial agriculture]{.underline}]{.mark}, an activity that the
report identifies as the biggest single contributor to species loss,
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} profoundly [[shaped]{.mark} [by
cap]{.mark}italism]{.underline}, not least because [[only a handful
of]{.underline}]{.mark} "commodity" [[species are deemed to have]{.mark}
any [value]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} because, in the sole
pursuit of profit and growth, "externalities" such as [[pollution and
biodiversity loss are ignored]{.underline}]{.mark}. And yet instead of
calling the irrationality of capitalism out for the ways in which it
renders most of life worthless, the [WWF [report]{.mark}]{.underline}
actually [[extends]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[capitalist logic by using
terms such as "natural assets" and "ecosystem services" to refer to the
living world.]{.underline}]{.mark}

By obscuring capitalism with a term that is merely one of its symptoms
-- "consumption" -- there is also [a risk that [blame]{.mark} and
responsibility [for species loss]{.mark} is]{.underline}
disproportionately [[shifted onto]{.mark} individual [lifestyle
choices]{.mark}]{.underline}, while the [larger and [more powerful
systems and institutions]{.mark}]{.underline} that are compelling

### Impact\-\--AT: Innovation\-\--2NC

#### Capitalist innovation's peaking\-\--[profit]{.underline} incentives encourage quantity [over]{.underline} quality.

Economic Commission; Essec Business School, "The Worrisome Decline in
Breakthrough Innovation,"
https://knowledge.essec.edu/en/innovation/the-worrisome-decline-in-breakthrough-innovation.html\]

In 2020, a study (Bloom et al., 2020) highlighted a [significant
**inefficiency** in the productivity of scientific
**research**]{.underline} output. Using sector-specific and aggregate
data from the United States, [the authors revealed a [**decline**
in]{.mark} the **[productivity]{.mark}** of US researchers [by **5.3%
per year**]{.mark} in aggregate data after 1970]{.underline}. This
research sparked discussions and debates among growth experts, with a
consensus on the main findings, as noted by [**Clancy**
(2023)]{.underline}. Supporting evidence from -based studies by
[**Park** et al. (2023) and **Chu** and Evans (2021) **corroborate** the
**decline** in productivity]{.underline} and reveal a [[**substantial**
decrease in]{.mark} the rate at which [**breakthrough**
innovations]{.mark} have **emerged**]{.underline} over the past fifty
years or so.

Concurrently, there has been a notable rise in the volume of research
papers published across diverse scientific fields, what Chu and Evans
(2021) refer to as a "deluge" of publications. Landhuis (2016) estimates
the annual growth rate of published scientific papers to around 8--9%
over the past several decades. In 2020, the Scopus database documented
4.6 million publications within the journals it encompasses,
representing an increase from the 1.3 million publications recorded in
2000. Furthermore, Nicolaisen and Frandsen (2019) observe that a
significant proportion ([approximately **[65%]{.mark}**]{.underline}) of
these papers [[do not receive **any** s]{.mark} within the **20
years**]{.underline} following their publication.

What's behind the declining numbers of breakthrough ideas arriving
simultaneously with a tsunami of publications?

According to Bhattacharya and Packalen (2020), [the [**existing**
system]{.mark} of **rewards** in science]{.underline}, with its
essential emphasis on publication-counting, can
[[explain]{.underline}]{.mark} both the torrent of publications and [the
**[declining]{.mark}** generation of major
**[innovations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The system involves high pay for
observed outcomes of research, publications and s, and [does
**[not]{.mark}** adequately [reward **hard-to-observe**]{.mark}
exploratory [research]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Gold (2021) argues that a [**lesser** propensity to take **risks**
against the background of increasingly [**expensive** research
prompted]{.mark}]{.underline} both academic organizations and
[**private** [firms to tune incentives toward **low impact**]{.mark} but
predictable [research]{.mark}]{.underline} outcomes. These incentives
for safe results "[[push **away** scholars from]{.mark} risk-taking, and
hence, **[breakthroughs]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Chu and Evans (2021) argue that at the origin of this ever-increasing
number of published papers, one can find the "more is better" vision of
scientific progress, which led to the generalization of quantitative
measures of scientific performance, and incentives to publish no matter
what. databases, available from the 1960s and extended in the 1990s with
the advent of the internet, allowed us to add an assessment for
"quality" without challenging the quantitative nature of the
measurement. They further claim that the [ever-**[increasing]{.mark}**
flow of [papers **obscures**]{.mark} the emergence of **[new]{.mark}**
valuable [ideas]{.mark}, which are [**lost** in]{.mark} the mass of
**[irrelevant]{.mark}** manuscripts]{.underline}.

In a recent paper in Research Policy (May 2024), Damien Besancenot
(Université de Paris) and Radu Vranceanu (ESSEC) offer a signaling model
as a complementary explanation to the declining number of breakthrough
ideas combined with ever rising publication numbers. Their analysis
builds on the assumption according to which, due to its disruptive
nature, a [[path-breaking **innovation**]{.mark} is generally observed
with a **[significant lag]{.mark}**]{.underline}. At the time [where a
**major** innovation is **recognized** as such, its [**authors**
have]{.mark} likely [moved]{.mark} to **another** organization, which
makes it almost [**impossible** to **contract**]{.mark} on breakthrough
innovation]{.underline}. Besancenot and Vranceanu back this assumption
with two contemporaneous examples (analyzed in detail), [the
**[mARN]{.mark}** technology and **[l]{.mark}**arge
**[l]{.mark}**anguage **[m]{.mark}**odel**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline},
which both were recognized as major innovations [with [**several** years
lag]{.mark}]{.underline}.

If managers of research institutions can observe publications but are
unable to observe breakthrough innovations, [low-skilled
[scholars]{.mark} might **[reduce]{.mark}** their investment in
[**exploratory** research]{.mark}]{.underline} and instead
[**[invest]{.mark}** time [in publishing]{.mark} as [**many**
papers]{.mark}]{.underline} as high-skilled scholars. This would allow
them to [[claim]{.mark} the **[same]{.mark}** level of
**[compensation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In response to the imitation by
low-skilled scholars, high-skilled scholars would publish even more,
reaching a point where low-skilled scholars would abandon the imitation
strategy.

[The **[outlook]{.mark}** for scientific research]{.underline}, as
implied by this signaling model, [[appears
**discouraging**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the most likely equilibrium,
where low-skilled researchers lack the ability to emulate the
publication strategy of their high-skilled counterparts,
[**[elevating]{.mark}** the relative **[rewards]{.mark}**]{.underline}
for significant innovation [would **[not]{.mark}** necessarily
[boost]{.mark} the [occurrence]{.mark} of such
**innovations**]{.underline}. While augmenting the overall resources
allocated to researchers might have a positive impact, [its
**[efficacy]{.mark}** could be **[diminished]{.mark}**]{.underline} as
some of these [resources might be diverted towards **increasing** the
number of **publications** rather than fostering **major**
innovations]{.underline}.

While experts continue to discuss the reasons behind the decreasing rate
of groundbreaking research, one certainty remains: tackling some of
[[humanity\'s]{.mark} most **fundamental**
[challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}, including [**resource** depletion,
**climate** change, widespread **diseases** and pandemics, and
persistent **poverty**, will [necessitate]{.mark} a
**[significant]{.mark}** infusion of
**[innovation]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Innovation

Many [big [**corporations** trust]{.mark} strategic [**coordination**
more than **market**]{.mark}-style inter-unit **competition** when it
comes to ensuring their **innovative** capability]{.underline} (Arora,
Belenzon, & Rios, 2011). Instead of letting each business unit rely
entirely on its own R&D efforts, they fund centralized R&D unit through
"taxes" on the business units. This [[**pooling** of innovation]{.mark}
resources [**reduces** duplication]{.mark} of innovation
efforts]{.underline} across the business units. [It also
**[ensures]{.mark}** that research scans a [**wider** horizon]{.mark}
and looks out **further** into the future]{.underline} than the business
units would be willing to do in their local R&D.

The challenge here lies in how to avoid this centralized R&D unit losing
touch with the needs of the business units --- developing innovative
concepts that the units do not need or cannot use. Since each type of
unit (R&D versus operations) has a different type of primary goal
(innovation versus efficiency), each is incentivized and staffed
differently, and their preferred solutions are often far apart. The
result is often a suboptimal compromise between product attributes and
cost, rather than the hoped-for, creatively integrative solution. As a
result of these failures, and given the increased volatility of the
business and technological context, many of these central R&D units have
been dismantled, with a corresponding loss of long-term innovation
capability and an increasing reliance on external sourcing of
shorter-term innovation options (Arora, Belenzon, Patacconi, & Suh,
2020).

Some corporations, however, have developed effective methods to deal
with this challenge. Better-managed corporations draw local business
unit leaders into the governance of their central R&D units. They ensure
that central R&D teams work collaboratively with staff from the business
units on innovation projects (e.g., McCreary, 2010). Instead of allowing
central R&D and business units to treat their innovations as their
private intellectual property and maximize their unit's profits by
charging sister divisions for the use of these innovations as they would
charge external customers, they develop collaborative cost-sharing
protocols (Eccles, 1983). And they invest in developing the skill base
of staff in the business units so they can participate effectively in
these projects and help discover integrative solutions (e.g., Schilling
et al., 2011).

[A **[democratic-socialist]{.mark}** system could]{.underline} follow
just such methods to dramatically [**[accelerate innovation]{.mark}**
and steer innovation efforts towards **climate** change
mitigation]{.underline} and adaptation. Imagine the [**acceleration** in
the rate of innovation]{.underline} that would result [if [enterprises
**collaborate**]{.mark}**d** rather than **competed**]{.underline} in
these innovation efforts, [and [if we **fund**]{.mark}**ed**
[democratic]{.mark}ally governed]{.underline} industry-level and
regional [**[R&D]{.mark}** centers and chartered them to **collaborate**
with the relevant enterprises]{.underline}. Taking inspiration from the
Apollo space program, Mazzucato (2018) identifies several environmental
priorities that could be addressed through such government-led R&D
"missions." Imagine, too, the acceleration of innovation we would see if
we abolished intellectual property laws, and if we [**invested** in the
development of the **innovative** capacity of the **entire**
workforce]{.underline} so everyone can participate.

[**Innovation** would also be **accelerated** under **democratic
socialism** by [expand]{.mark}ed [opportunities for
**entrepreneurship**]{.mark}]{.underline}. If they proposed new ways of
achieving our democratically-determined goals, [**entrepreneurial**
[ventures]{.mark} could [get]{.mark} **access** to [financing
from]{.mark} the **[public]{.mark}** investment]{.underline} bank or
from existing public enterprises. This would [greatly [reduce]{.mark}
the [**impediments** to innovation]{.mark} created [by]{.mark} our
[current **v**]{.mark}enture **[c]{.mark}**apital system, which [sets
**absurdly high**]{.mark} expectations for **[returns]{.mark}** to
investment]{.underline} in startups. If they were successful and grew to
a certain size threshold, these startups would be bought out at a fair
price by the [[**socialized** enterprises best]{.mark} placed to
**deploy** their innovations]{.underline}. Would the absence of outsized
IPO rewards deter entrepreneurship? This is a question that our
scholarship has already asked and answered: no, [[most]{.mark}
**innovative** [entrepreneurship]{.mark} is [**driven** by]{.mark}
achievement and **[social]{.mark}** motives [rather than]{.mark} by
**[money]{.mark}**]{.underline} (McClelland, 1961; Murnieks, Klotz, &
Shepherd, 2020).

#### Biotech advancements create [multiple vectors]{.underline} for bioweaponization.

former lecturer in International Relations at SOAS University of London;

Earth, "The Planetary Polycrisis," Ch. 1\]

[The **weaponization** of biotechnology is]{.underline} arguably [the
most **alarming**]{.underline} dimension of the [**crisis**.
[Biotechnology]{.mark}]{.underline} refers to a broad category of
technologies that "[[**exploit** biological processes for
**industrial**]{.underline}]{.mark}, medical, or other production
[[purposes]{.underline}]{.mark}," [[which includes **synthetic**]{.mark}
biology [and **g**]{.mark}enome **[e]{.mark}**diting
techniques]{.underline} (e.g., **[[CRISPR]{.underline}]{.mark}**-Cas9)
[[that can **tinker**]{.mark} with biological organisms [or]{.mark} even
**[design new]{.mark}** ones from **scratch**]{.underline}.205 The
promise of synthetic biology is vast---and we can largely thank it for
the mRNA vaccines that helped save millions of lives during the COVID-19
pandemic206---but by the same token so is its destructive potential. As
a National Academies of Sciences (NAS) report puts it, "It is possible
to imagine an almost limitless number of potential malevolent uses for
synthetic biology."207 For example, [[existing pathogens]{.mark} can be
[**modified**, or new]{.mark} ones [**designed** from **scratch**,
with]{.mark} much [**higher virulence** and **resistance** to
vaccines]{.mark}]{.underline}.208 Furthermore, [CRISPR gene editing can
be **weaponized** in ways that go beyond **modifying
pathogens**]{.underline}: [[disease-carrying **insects**]{.mark} could
be [modified to **transmit diseases**]{.mark} more easily]{.underline},
formerly harmless insects could be altered to carry dangerous diseases,
and pollinating insects could be infected with "gene drives" to
propagate genetic variants that induce population collapse--- thus
disrupting agricultural systems.209 At present, as biosecurity experts
emphasize, bioweaponization risks are overwhelmingly posed by states and
state-sponsored groups, since these capabilities remain highly dependent
on advanced technologies and laboratory equipment.210 However, the NAS
report shows that [improvements in **[DNA synthesis]{.mark}**
technologies]{.underline} "[have [followed]{.mark} a '**[Moore's
Law]{.mark}**--like' curve [for]{.mark} both [**reductions** in
**costs** and **increases** in]{.mark} the [**length** of **constructs**
that are **attainable**]{.mark}]{.underline}," and that "[these trends
are likely to **continue**]{.underline}."211 [The
[result]{.mark}]{.underline}---as Gaymon Bennett and colleagues aptly
suggest---[[is]{.mark} a "**[black swan]{.mark}** waiting to
happen."]{.underline}212

#### SRM [fails]{.underline} AND [increases warming]{.underline}\-\--[extinction]{.underline}.

**Albert '24** \[Michael; 2024; lecturer in Global Environment Politics
at the University of Edinburgh, Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University, and
former lecturer in International Relations at SOAS University of London;
Navigating the Polycrisis: Mapping the Futures of Capitalism and the
Earth, "The Socioecological Problematic: Climate, Energy, Food, and the
Futures of Capitalism," Ch. 4\]

In this context, a scientific consensus emerges that a tipping-point
cascade might be slowly in the making. Policymakers and [[**capitalist**
elites]{.mark} are]{.underline} thus [**increasingly
[pressured]{.mark}** [to turn to]{.mark}]{.underline} "plan B": solar
radiation management (**[[SRM]{.underline}]{.mark}**), [or **spraying
sulfides** into the atmosphere to **block out**]{.underline} solar
[radiation and prevent]{.underline} further [temperature
increases]{.underline}. The aim, following proposals by David Keith and
the Harvard Solar Geoengineering Research Program, would be to enact a
"temporary, moderate, and responsive" SRM program that can slow or halt
the rate of warming, [thereby **buying time** for **global capitalism**
to transition beyond fossil fuels]{.underline} while avoiding the twin
threats of accumulating physical risks on one side and stranded assets
on the other.136 As Kevin Surprise argues, [SRM would]{.underline} in
this way [serve as a "**safety valve**]{.underline}---[a **mechanism**
that can **relieve**]{.underline} (for **[capital]{.underline}**) [some
of the **immediate pressures** of the climate crisis and enable
a]{.underline} \[more gradual\] [**passive revolution** from fossil
capitalism to green capitalism]{.underline}."137 By midcentury, on a
current-policies or NDC pathway, this much-dreaded strategy will almost
certainly see the light of day. In this case, another "what if" question
emerges: What if it works? And what if it doesn't? It is certainly
possible in principle that SRM could work in the ways hoped for by David
Keith and company. However, its feasibility depends not only on
questionable assumptions that the climate system could be reliably
modified like a linear mechanistic system; equally problematic is the
assumption that [[a **multidecadal** SRM]{.mark} program]{.underline}
wouldn't be [[**plagued** by]{.underline}]{.mark} the same [patterns of
**interstate [conflict]{.mark}**[, **weak coop**]{.mark}eration,
[**polarization**, **short-sightedness**, and]{.mark} **sheer
[irrationalism]{.mark}**]{.underline} that stifled plan A (i.e.,
reducing emissions).138 As Catriona MacKinnon forcefully argues, the
geographic dispersion of [SRM infrastructures]{.underline} across global
space and the need to sustain such a program across many decades means
it would [**[require]{.mark}** "**[unprecedented]{.mark} levels** of
**sustained inter-[state]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**cross-[corporation]{.mark}** [trust]{.mark}, cooperation, [and
transparency]{.mark}."]{.underline}139 [[If it
**fails**]{.underline}]{.mark}---for example, [[as]{.mark} a [result
of]{.mark} unanticipated **atmospheric [complexities]{.mark}**[,
**tech**]{.mark}nical **[failures]{.mark}**, impacts on the
**[ozone]{.mark}**]{.underline} layer,
[**[cyber]{.mark}**-sabotage]{.underline} (either [from **states** or
**nonstate** actors]{.underline}), [**[supply]{.mark} chain**
[disruptions]{.mark}, and]{.underline}/or [interstate **Asian
[monsoons]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} triggers catastrophic impacts on
[**food** and **water security**]{.mark} in
**India**]{.underline})---[[then]{.mark} the
**[consequences]{.mark}**]{.underline} could [[involve]{.mark} a
**catastrophic** "**[termination shock]{.mark}**": a [**massive pulse**
of warming resulting from]{.mark} the [**buildup** of]{.mark}
atmospheric [CO2]{.mark}]{.underline} between the period of initial
deployment and termination of SRM.140 The risks of termination shock
remain uncertain and contested, but "are we willing to bet the climate
that no catastrophe or systemic cascade will trigger \[SRM's\] downside"
over the course of a multidecadal SRM program, as Aaron Tang and Luke
Kemp ask?141 And [even a **less dramatic** failure of SRM would have
**catastrophic consequences**: [**2°C+warming** and ongoing]{.mark}
**nonlinear [feedbacks]{.mark}** [would **recommence**]{.mark}, energy
and material resources would be **wasted**, and the]{.underline}
psychological [impact]{.underline} on investor confidence [could be
**immense**]{.underline}.

#### Utilizing the state [avoids]{.underline} rightwing backlash.

former lecturer in International Relations at SOAS University of London;

Trade-Offs, and Authoritarian Dangers," vol. 34\]

How do we strategically confront this challenge? On one hand, rather
than hoping for smooth democratic transitions to ecosocialist degrowth
or sidestepping difficult questions about the transition period,
ecosocialists should reflect more systematically on the domestic and
international threats that ecosocialisms-in-transition would confront --
including capital flight, of course, but also militant far-right
resistance, cyberattacks, social media-enhanced disinformation
operations from capitalists and counterrevolutionary states, and other
forms of sabotage -- and how they might respond. Furthermore,
ideological commitments to radical democracy should not prevent
**[[ecosocialists]{.underline}]{.mark}** from at least maintaining an
"openness to some degree of hard power from the state," as Malm
suggests, or to the possible [necessity of [**repurposing** the
state's]{.mark} coercive [apparatus to **defend**]{.mark} ecosocialist
[transitions]{.mark} from **reactionary** currents]{.underline} (Malm
2020, 153). The specific strategies this might entail would vary
according to the national-political context, but the point here is that
such problems must be anticipated and systematically explored in advance
in order to work out creative solutions.

On the other hand, if authoritarian or coercive measures are indeed
deemed necessary to defend ecosocialisms-in-transition, then we must
also envision strategies that may enable ecosocialist regimes to
[navigate the "**emergency**" phase while laying the **longer-term**
conditions for "extension of popular **democratic** control]{.underline}
over state and society," rather than irreversibly institutionalizing
authoritarian forms of emergency rule (Petras and Fitzgerald 1988, 93).
Lebowitz and Kovel, for instance, emphasize the [[importance of
**building**]{.mark} and nurturing new forms of democratic
**[self-governance]{.mark}**]{.underline} from below that can
**[[avoid]{.underline}]{.mark}** or at least attenuate [[tendencies
toward **authoritarian**]{.mark} statism]{.underline} (Kovel 2007;
Lebowitz 2006). Indeed, as many ecosocialists, ecofeminists, and
degrowth scholars recognize, interstitial [**movements** like commoning,
**Transition Towns**]{.underline}, solidarity economies, peasant-based
[agroecology networks, and indigenous sovereignty]{.underline} (among
others) [can be considered "**seeds**" of an ecosocialist degrowth
participatory **democracy**]{.underline} (Kallis et al. 2020; Salleh
2017; Kovel 2007). Of course, while there are thousands of such
initiatives and movements across the planet, they remain small and
imperfect oases in a vast desert of alienated consumption (especially in
the global north). Thus the question is how these movements might gain
wider participation, propagate, and with time forge critical masses of
mutually-supportive cooperative economies at local and regional scales
(Kallis et al. 2020, 46). One key objective of a radical GND should be
to [[channel **state funding**]{.mark} and [legal
**protection**]{.mark}]{.underline} for these initiatives [so that they
can steadily **grow** and [**protect** themselves from **capitalist**
pressures]{.mark}]{.underline} (Kallis et al. 2020). This should also be
[accompanied by [programs]{.mark} to [**revitalize rural**
regions]{.mark} that have become [seedbeds of **rightwing
populism**]{.mark}]{.underline}---involving an antitrust assault on big
agribusiness, relieving pressures on small and medium scale family
farms, and investing in rural hospitals, internet, and localized
rural-urban food supply chains---thereby addressing the insecurities and
grievances felt by many in these communities (Hogseth 2020). Together,
these [initiatives could help **[grow]{.mark}** the micro-foundations of
an **[ecosocialist]{.mark}** participatory [democracy]{.mark} while
**[weakening]{.mark}** the currents of **[rightwing
populism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, though this would be a slow
multi-decadal process. We should not disregard the potential for social
tipping points (Kallis et al. 2020, 89), but even in a bestcase scenario
where democratic majorities become involved in or supportive of these
alternative economies, many people will resist giving up
energy-intensive consumption, mobility, and dietary habits, providing
ample opportunities for recalcitrant capitalists, far-right forces, and
counter-revolutionary states to foment division and
counter-revolutionary rebellion.

[Capitalism\'s inherent **[growth]{.mark}** mechanism is a **shared**
basis for why many environmental **scientists**]{.underline}, social
scientists, and environmentalists [point to capitalism as a **central**
[driver of **ecological** harm]{.mark}, including **climate**
change]{.underline} (e.g., Foster et al. 2010; Wright and Nyberg 2014;
Klein 2015; Moore 2015; Stuart et al. 2020; Fraser 2023). Expanding
production to increase [profits **requires** materials and energy,
energy use is still **heavily** reliant on fossil fuels, and a swift
**transition** to 100% renewable energy remains **constrained** by
continued economic **growth**]{.underline} (York and Bell 2019). Using
increasing levels of energy each year makes decarbonization much more
difficult (Hickel and Kallis 2019).

Studies continue to show a co-integrated or interdependent relationship
between energy consumption and economic growth (Ozturk et al. 2010;
Belke et al. 2011; Acheampong et al. 2021). This is because economic
growth requires energy to produce goods and services. Additional
[research shows [**positive** linkages between **GDP**]{.mark}, energy
consumption, [and]{.mark} GHG **[emissions]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g.,
Mardani et al. 2019; Haberl et al. 2020; Chen et al. 2022). By one
estimate a 1% increase in GDP equals a 0.5%--0.7% increase in emissions
(Burke et al. 2015). Others have pointed out that [the [**only**
times]{.mark} that global GHG [emissions]{.mark} have
**[decreased]{.mark}** have been [during]{.mark} economic
**[recessions]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Feng et al. 2015), for example,
during the Covid-19 pandemic shutdown in 2020 (Shan et al. 2021).
Increasing energy use to fuel a growing economy undermines efforts for a
transition to a low-carbon energy system. In addition, [a **low-carbon**
energy system would **only** address the **73%** of emissions related to
energy]{.underline} (Ritchie and Roser 2023). [GDP **growth** would
likely **continue** to increase GHG **emissions** from the other 27%
other sources]{.underline} (Hickel 2016), which include agriculture,
deforestation, cement, landfills, and chemicals (Ritchie and Roser
2023). This context is [**critical** for understanding why **current**
strategies to mitigate climate change have been largely
**ineffective**]{.underline}. Because of the inherent relationship
between economic growth, energy consumption, and GHG emissions, more
scientists are stating that [it is **necessary** to transform our
economy]{.underline} (e.g., Steffen et al. 2018; Ripple et al. 2020;
Chen et al. 2022). Despite widespread government support for [**green**
growth]{.underline} strategies, which attempt to address environmental
issues while maintaining economic growth, [evidence casts **doubt** on
the **feasibility** of these strategies]{.underline} given the need to
rapidly reduce GHG emissions.

3 Green Growth Capitalism and Its Critics

The dominant climate mitigation strategies adopted by most governments
include a focus on transitioning to renewable energy, increasing energy
efficiency, and using technologies to transition to low-carbon
transportation, energy, and production systems---all of this while
increasing economic growth. This strategy is referred to as "[**green**
growth]{.underline}," as it assumes reducing GHG emissions with
continued economic growth. This is [seen as a "**win-win**"
strategy]{.underline} because it offers a way to continue increasing
material and energy production and consumption in a way that is
decoupled from GHG emissions. In other words, [**tech**nological
advancements can be used to **sustain** current levels of economic
**growth** while reducing GHG **emissions** at the same
time]{.underline}. Green growth has been a leading principle in climate
reports and discussions for decades and can be found in official reports
from organizations including the United Nations, the International
Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the International Energy Agency
(IEA). Most mitigation scenarios analyzed by the IPCC assume continued
economic growth and include Bioenergy Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS)
as a key negative emissions strategy. However, [**[BECCS]{.mark}** does
[not]{.mark} exist [at **scale** and]{.mark} widespread [application
faces]{.mark} **many** obstacles including [**financial** feasibility
and **land** availability]{.mark}]{.underline} (Fajardy and Mac Dowell
2017; Muri 2018; Creutzig et al. 2021). The IEA also includes future
technologies as a key part of mitigation, assuming that 46% of emissions
reductions between 2030 and 2050 will be achieved with technologies that
are still in demonstration or prototype stages (Lenaerts et al. 2022).

However, [[based on]{.mark} historical and current
**[trends]{.mark}**]{.underline}, social scientists conclude that the
[**inherent** relationships between economic **growth** and GHG
**emissions** makes [green growth **unlikely** to]{.mark} happen to the
extent and rate **necessary** to [avoid]{.mark} dangerous levels of
**[warming]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g., Hickel and Kallis 2019; Vadén
et al. 2021). According to the United Nations (2023), we are currently
heading towards 3°C of warming by 2100. Thus, the key question is not
only if green growth strategies can be effective at decarbonization, but
if they can be effective quickly enough to change our current trajectory
of warming. The answer to this question depends on the ability to
decouple economic growth and GHG emissions. Decoupling refers to
increasing GDP growth without increasing environmental harms, or in this
case GHG emissions. Absolute decoupling is the reduction in overall
emissions, while relative decoupling is the reduction in emissions per
unit of production (Jackson 2009). [To effectively **mitigate climate**
change, [decoupling must]{.mark} not only [be **absolute**]{.mark} but
must also be [at a **global scale** and]{.mark} be
**[permanent]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Vadén et al. 2021). While renewable
energy, energy efficiency, and certain carbon sequestration approaches
are likely necessary for climate mitigation, an increasing number of
scholars are arguing that [the [**effectiveness** of]{.mark} these
**[tech]{.mark}**nological solutions will remain [**limited** in]{.mark}
a [growing econ]{.mark}omy]{.underline} and that we cannot achieve
global decoupling fast enough. Evidence continues to mount that
[avoiding **severe** climate impacts may require **more** than green
growth strategies]{.underline}, especially because of the inherent
relationship between GHG emissions and economic growth.

A widely cited analysis of national-level data between 2015 and 2018
(Hubacek et al. 2021) found that absolute decoupling of GHG emission
from GDP can be identified in 32 countries in terms of production-based
emissions (from production processes taking place within each country).
In contrast, only 23 countries showed absolute decoupling in terms of
consumption-based emissions, which includes emissions from imported
goods. [Only [**14** countries]{.mark} demonstrated **absolute**
decoupling in terms of both **production** and **consumption**-based
emissions]{.underline}. The authors explain that [**absolute**
decoupling is **not** happening at the rate and scale
**necessary**]{.underline} (quickly and globally) and conclude that
["\[e\]ven countries that have [**achieved** absolute decoupling]{.mark}
are [still **adding** emissions]{.mark} to the atmosphere thus
[showing]{.mark} the **[limits]{.mark}** of 'green growth']{.underline}
and the growth paradigm" (Hubacek et al. 2021: 9).

Additional [studies have examined **recent** trends]{.underline} and
reached similar conclusions about decoupling. Haberl et al. (2020)
[systematically reviewed **[835]{.mark}** peer-reviewed [articles for
**ev**]{.mark}**idence** of decoupling]{.underline}. They found that
evidence of relative decoupling can be commonly found, while
[**absolute** decoupling is **not** occurring globally or at the rates
**necessary**]{.underline}. They conclude that [[**observed**
decoupling]{.mark} rates will [**not** result in]{.mark} the emissions
[reductions **necessary**]{.mark}]{.underline} for global climate
targets and therefore a reduction in material and energy use is
necessary.

While current data does not show signs of decoupling at the rate and
scale necessary, it is possible that these conditions could change in
the future. However, [Moriarty and Honnery]{.underline} (2023: 12)
[reviewed **[96]{.mark}** peer-reviewed articles and
**[conclude]{.mark}** that "[**absolute** decoupling]{.mark} of GDP and
emissions has **not** occurred and is [even **less likely** in the
**future**]{.mark}" given the likelihood that **[wind]{.mark}** and
**[solar]{.mark}** development will [face **shortages** of]{.mark} rare
[materials and]{.mark} the **[low e]{.mark}**nergy **[r]{.mark}**eturn
**[o]{.mark}**n **[i]{.mark}**nvestment of renewable
energy]{.underline}. They conclude that high-emitting countries must
reduce energy use and aid less developed countries in low/non-carbon
energy development.

Additional studies have used models to assess the potential for future
decoupling. Ward et al. (2016: 10) model demonstrates that "growth in
GDP ultimately cannot plausibly be decoupled from material and energy
use." Keyßer and Lenzen (2021) used [**integrated** assessment
models]{.underline} to compare archetype IPCC scenarios with 1.5°C
degrowth scenarios and [conclude that **degrowth** scenarios demonstrate
the **lowest** risk in terms of **feasibility** and
sustainability]{.underline}. Slameršak et al. (2024) compared model
scenarios for low-growth and high-growth assumptions finding that
low-growth rates allow for mitigation without a dependence on uncertain
future technologies and unprecedented rates of decoupling. Their
ambitious [**[low-growth]{.mark}** scenario was the [**only**
scenario]{.mark} that was [**consistent** with]{.mark} the mitigation
pathways to [**limit** warming]{.mark} to 1.5°C]{.underline}. They
conclude that their scenarios indicate that lower economic growth rates
make rapid mitigation more feasible and high-growth scenarios resulted
in higher emissions and greater risks.

Several factors associated with a growing economy inhibit absolute and
global decoupling and undermine the prospects for green growth. Energy
[[efficiency **gains**]{.underline}]{.mark} are in many cases
[[**offset** by]{.mark} additional energy
**[consumption]{.mark}**]{.underline}, referred to as rebound effects.
Explained by what is referred to as [**[Jevons]{.mark} Paradox**,
rebound effects are **[widespread]{.mark}**]{.underline} and occur due
to direct or indirect increases in consumption as a result of efficiency
gains (York 2006; York and McGee 2015; Adua et al. 2021; York et al.
2022). Thus, [the full **potential** of efficiency gains is
**undermined** by increasing consumption]{.underline}. This can be
significant. Brockway et al. (2021) found that [**[rebound]{.mark}**
effects may **[reduce]{.mark}** economy-wide energy **[savings]{.mark}**
from efficiency strategies [by more than **half**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Through modeling [data from the **[US]{.mark}**, UK, France, Germany,
and Italy]{.underline}, Berner et al. (2022) found that [within a
two-year period [**rebound** effects]{.mark} ranged from 70% to
**[101%]{.mark}**, with over 100% meaning that there was [a **total
increase**]{.mark} in energy use]{.underline}. They concluded that
without efforts to reduce consumption, the effect of efficiency
strategies will remain limited. Similarly, Segovia-Martin et al. (2023)
found that due to significant rebound effects efficiency measures are
unsustainable without having sufficiency measures that reduce demand and
consumption.

Another factor that constrains the realization of green growth, is that
in a growing economy, where more materials and energy are being used
each year, [**[renewable]{.mark}** energy sources are largely [being
**added**]{.mark} to fossil fuel use [rather than **replacing**]{.mark}
them]{.underline}. This has been identified by York (2012), Zehner
(2012), Thombs (2017), York and Bell (2019), among others, and can be
seen in global energy use trends. For example, according to the
International Energy Agency (IEA 2023), in 2022 approximately [**82%**
of global energy consumption was from **fossil fuels**]{.underline}.
Because total global energy demand rose 1%, [even **significant** gains
in renewable energy development did not **replace** fossil
fuels]{.underline}. An early analysis of 2023 data (Riedlingstein et al.
2023) found that [[**emissions** from fossil]{.mark} fuels
[increased]{.mark} 1.1% [in]{.mark} **20[23]{.mark}** [compared
to]{.mark} **20[22]{.mark}** levels]{.underline}. Predictions from the
IEA also indicate that fossil fuel use is expected to peak and go down
to approximately 73% by 2030 (IEA 2023), yet growing energy demands make
this transition less likely and much slower than it would be in a steady
state of energy use. As a result of these combined trends, reducing
global GHG emissions has remained elusive. In each case, the
technological tools that offer mitigation potential, efficiency gains
and renewable energy, are at least partially undermined by economic
growth. Therefore, based on this evidence, Hickel and Kallis (2019)
argue that [continued **growth** makes staying within global **climate**
targets of 1.5°C or 2.0°C **very unlikely**]{.underline}.

The energy transformations that remain key pillars of green growth
strategies are essential to mitigate climate change; however, scientists
and even some policymakers are acknowledging that they are not enough
(Savin and King 2023). In other words, [**[tech]{.mark}**nologies
[alone]{.mark} will **[not]{.mark}** be [enough]{.mark}]{.underline} and
governments must also reduce excessive and unnecessary production and
consumption (and related energy use) that undermine the effectiveness of
mitigation technologies. [**Tech**nologies developed]{.underline} and
used [for the purpose of **reducing** GHG emissions would [more]{.mark}
rapidly and **[effective]{.mark}ly** reduce emissions [in]{.mark} a no
growth or **[degrowth]{.mark}** scenario]{.underline} (Keyßer and Lenzen
2021). As we discuss elsewhere (Stuart et al. 2020), technology is
neither inherently good nor bad, as the outcomes of technological use
depend on the goals of the system in which it is used. For example, are
the goals profit and economic growth or wellbeing and sustainability?
Using technology is not restricted to a green growth agenda and
technologies in a post-growth and post-capitalist economy would likely
be much more effective.

The integration of technological tools and systemic changes is already
being explored. For example, the EU is funding research to examine
post-growth policies that can be used along with technological tools to
mitigate climate change (Horizon 2023; Sandbu 2023). In other words, in
addition to transitioning to renewable energy and increasing energy
efficiency, they are considering the use of sufficiency measures that
address the unnecessary production and consumption that reduce the
effectiveness of technological solutions. As the policy proposals we
identify later in this article will illustrate, these sufficiency
measures are not meant to create a diminished quality of life but aim to
reign in excess, increase equity and wellbeing, and mitigate global
warming. As climate change presents an existential threat to humanity,
using multiple tools and approaches will be required. "Green"
technologies can be used, expanded, and further developed in a system
where the primary goals are wellbeing and sustainability rather than
economic growth. Next, we explore what a post-growth/post-capitalist
system might look like focusing on the similarities between ecosocialist
and degrowth thinking. As we will detail later, these two areas of
theoretical development offer a foundation for developing concrete
policy proposals to address climate change and transition to a
post-capitalist system.

Cross-national evidence indicates that [[**GDP** remains
**coupled**]{.mark} to resource use as measured by **material
footprint**]{.underline} (ie, accounting for the biomass, minerals,
metals, and fossil fuels required to support the final consumption of
goods and services).47 This [[**finding holds** across]{.mark} material
categories and **[most regions]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with some
exceptions, such as decreasing fossil fuel use in some European
countries.47 The [**[consensus]{.mark}** from recent reviews [and
**meta-analyses**]{.mark}]{.underline} is that while relative decoupling
of GDP from material use is common, [there is **[no ev]{.mark}idence**
[of]{.mark} sustained **[absolute decoupling]{.mark}**]{.underline}.2,48
Moreover, modelled projections indicate that [at the [**global**
scale]{.mark}, **absolute decoupling** is [**unlikely** to occur even
with **optimistic** assumptions]{.mark} about
**tech**nology]{.underline}.49

Why are resources and GDP so tightly coupled? A first explanation
focuses on the so-called **[rebound effect]{.underline}**---the
hypothesis that technological improvements in resource efficiency do not
necessarily yield reduced resource use because declining costs lead to
increased demand.50 A [study of **[57 cases]{.mark}**]{.underline} of
materials and modern artefacts, for example, [found **[no
ev]{.mark}idence** [of **dematerialisation**]{.mark}]{.underline},51 and
economy-wide energy [**rebounds** of 78--**101%** have been observed in
the **USA**, the UK, and some European countries]{.underline}.52 Another
explanation focuses on the material intensity of services, structural
change, and international trade. A global empirical analysis found that
all sectors of the economy are roughly equivalent in terms of their
climate, land, and water impacts due to the embedded resource
requirements of services and the fact that incomes earned in the service
sector are partly spent on material goods.53 Cross-border research
indicates that [as [**high**-income economies]{.mark}
**grow**]{.underline} and shift towards services, [they increasingly
**[offshore]{.mark}** agricultural and industrial
**[production]{.mark}**]{.underline} and rely on imports47 (eg, for
agriculture, the Global North net-imports embodied land and biomass from
the Global South54). [**Domestic** material extraction might therefore
**decline**, but [**total** material
**footprint**]{.mark}]{.underline}---which accounts for materials
embodied in trade---[continues to **[increase]{.mark}**]{.underline}.47
These explanations are in line with the ecological economics view of the
engine of the economy being energy, materials, and human labour.55

With carbon emissions, the picture is more complex, since substitution
with cleaner energy is possible. In the period 2005--15, absolute
decoupling of GDP from emissions occurred in several high-income
countries, even accounting for trade (ie, consumption-based
emissions).56 However, this time period was one of historically low
growth for many of these nations (figure 3), suggesting that while
decoupling is possible, the rate of growth still matters, and the lower
it is, the more feasible absolute decoupling becomes. In the USA, for
instance, the [**2008 recession** was an **important** cause of
**emissions reduction**]{.underline},57 [**complicating** arguments
about **green growth**]{.underline}. A 2018 study found that Sweden,
Denmark, and Finland have achieved sufficient decoupling,46 but critics
have noted that this assessment uses the 2°C carbon budget instead of a
1·5°C budget and ignores consumption-based emissions.58 The [[**speed**
of reduction]{.mark} is also **[not sufficient]{.mark}**]{.underline}
from a fairness perspective if one accounts for the higher mitigation
responsibilities of countries that historically have been high emitters
of greenhouse gases.58,59 Even the best performing nations, such as the
UK and Sweden, are not on track to meet Paris Agreement objectives, as a
fair distribution of the global carbon budget would require them to
reduce emissions by 10% and 12% each year, respectively, which is double
their existing policy commitments.60

Despite this uncertainty about the prospects of sufficient decoupling,
green growth remains a standard feature of the climate mitigation
scenarios for 1·5°C and 2°C that are modelled using conventional
integrated assessment models and reviewed by the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change (IPCC).61,62 These scenarios reconcile economic growth
with climate goals by relying on hypothetical large-scale negative
emissions technologies with CO2 removal schemes developed in the future,
unprecedented energy efficiency improvements, or both.63 These scenarios
also ignore climate impacts on the economy and society.64 Several
studies raise questions about the risks of relying on untested negative
emissions technologies65 and about the historically unprecedented rates
of GDP--energy decoupling in low-energy scenarios.52 Five new studies
show how [[**reductions** in]{.mark} aggregate **[output]{.mark}** make
[achieving **climate**]{.mark} objectives **[easier]{.mark}**, without
having to rely on possibly **unrealistic** assumptions about
**tech**nological change]{.underline}.66--70

If the standard green growth argument is that growth can continue while
ecological pressures are reduced to sustainable levels, a stronger claim
is that greening the economy can itself be an engine of growth. Several
economic models show that investments in green infrastructure and
climate mitigation might have a multiplier effect that increases growth
in countries with economic slack.71--73 The short-run stimulus effects
of a clean energy transition, however, should be distinguished from
possible second-order, or longer-run effects.74 There are [open
**questions** concerning whether **green** investments **crowd out**
other, more **productive**]{.underline} (in terms of GDP)
[investments]{.underline},75 [or whether **stranded** fossil fuel
**assets** might cause **financial shocks** that impact GDP
negatively]{.underline}.72 Models show that if clean energies depend on
dirty inputs for their production, [**[tech]{.mark}**nological
innovation [does **not suffice** to]{.mark} both [**sustain growth** and
**reduce emissions**]{.mark}]{.underline}.76 There are ongoing debates
regarding the social and environmental impacts of a clean energy
transition,77--79 its implications in terms of the net energy left for
other societal uses,79,80 and the emissions that this transition will
involve.79 A related argument is that a decline in energy return on
energy investment---ie, the ratio between the amount of energy produced
and the amount of energy used to produce that energy, therefore a proxy
of a net energy surplus---will negatively impact growth81 and that if it
falls below a certain minimum ratio, growth might altogether become
impossible.82 However, concerns that a shift to renewables could
precipitate such a scenario are probably misplaced, as renewables have
comparable, if not higher, energy return on energy investment than
fossil fuels, when energy returns are measured at the point of use.83,84

[[While capitalism]{.mark} has [increased the **s**]{.mark}tandard
**[o]{.mark}**f **[l]{.mark}**iving for millions of people, [it has done
so at the]{.mark} **[expense of nature]{.mark}**. Wildlife has been
negatively impacted so much in the past 500 years, [human
activity]{.mark} has [led to 500 species]{.mark} of land animals going
[extinct]{.mark}, a rate that has caused [scientists]{.mark} to [warn of
a]{.mark} sixth [mass extinction]{.mark}]{.underline} (Carey, 2015).
Some may argue that climate change is a natural phenomenon and that
humans are not to blame but the scientific evidence has demonstrated
that [human behaviour is the main driver of climate change]{.underline}
(Swim JK, 2011). We are responsible for the current mass extinction of
species and the suffering of animals, whether that is from rising
temperatures which is disrupting the ecosystems to habitat destruction
caused by resource extraction. As [[habitats shrink]{.mark} and
[ecosystems]{.mark} [degrade]{.mark}, countless species struggle to
survive and are often forced to migrate. This is seen with
overfishing.]{.underline} Overfishing is when too many fish are taken
out of the ocean creating an imbalance that can erode the food chain and
lead to a loss of important marine life, including vulnerable species
like sea turtles and corals (World Wild life, 2024).

[Ultimately **[the chain reaction]{.mark}** put into motion by
capitalism's relentless pursuit of profit [is not just an]{.mark}
[economic]{.mark} or class [issue, but]{.mark} also **[a]{.mark}
profound [threat]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} our planet's [biodiversity
and]{.mark} overall [stability]{.mark}.]{.underline} Corporations have
known of the threat for quite some time but have completely ignored it
as [sustainable practices are viewed as more costly and less
profitable.]{.underline} For example, in 1995 Royal Dutch Shell planned
to sink the Brent Spar oil platform in the North Atlantic as a low-cost
method of disposal (Weyler, 2016). However, this would have negatively
impacted the ocean's ecosystem, potentially releasing toxic substances
that could harm marine life and disrupt delicate ecological balances
that are present within oceans. [Capitalism often blames consumers for
how much climate change has progressed in the last hundred
years.]{.underline} For example, there are massive programmes for
household waste recycling, creating the illusion that consumer choices
are the main drivers of environmental damages. [Meanwhile, [there is
a]{.mark} [lack of]{.mark} government funding or [policies to ensure
major corporations adopt]{.mark} green energy [solutions]{.mark} of
sustainable practices even though since 1988 [just 100 companies]{.mark}
have been [the source of]{.mark} more than [70% of]{.mark} the world's
**[g]{.mark}**reen**[h]{.mark}**ouse **[g]{.mark}**a**[s]{.mark}**
emissions (Riley, 2017).]{.underline}

**[[We must act now]{.underline}]{.mark}** if we want our precious
animals and wildlife to live as they once did, free from the threat of
extinction caused by climate change which is at its tipping point,
beyond which there is no redemption (Hansen, 2008).

[[While]{.mark} high-income [countries]{.mark} (e.g. UK and USA) [record
high]{.mark}er [life expectancy]{.mark} than low-income countries, and
do not experience the same kind of infectious disease burden as
them]{.underline} (because of their stage in economic development; GBD
2021 Causes of Death Collaborators, 2024), [[they]{.mark} do in fact
[experience a]{.mark} **[greater burden of mental health
problems]{.mark}** (e.g. anxiety and depression). Strong evidence shows
that [this]{.mark} burden [is exacerbated by income
inequality]{.mark}]{.underline} (Ruscio et al., 2017; Patel et al.,
2018b; Wilkinson and Pickett, 2018; GBD 2019 Mental Disorders
Collaborators, 2022; Henking et al., 2023). For example, in a
[meta-analysis of research on the link between income inequality and
mental illness, Ribeiro et al. (Ribeiro et al., 2017) revealed that
[greater inequality]{.mark} [is related with]{.mark} higher rates of
**[mental illness]{.mark}**, especially depression and anxiety
disorders.]{.underline} This well-established link was vividly
illustrated in the documentary film, The Divide, inspired by the work of
Wilkinson and Pickett (Wilkinson and Pickett, 2010).

There are a couple of plausible reasons for why [economic [division
degrades mental health]{.mark} and well-being]{.underline}. The [first
concerns the psychological response of individuals to their perceived
status in the social order]{.underline}. Human perceptions are relative
(see contrast effect; Cialdini, 2007). [They are based on our own
experiences and the experiences of others.]{.underline} With regards to
the latter, [[we are deeply sensitive to social]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[status]{.underline}]{.mark}---our position relativ[e to others
(Layard, 2005). [When]{.mark} income [inequality is high, this]{.mark}
can [result in]{.mark} widespread
**[discontentment]{.mark}**]{.underline} because individuals see
themselves as losing out, even when they are affluent in absolute and
relative terms. Higher [[status anxiety is]{.mark} thought to be [**more
prevalent** in countries with wider]{.mark} income
[differentials]{.mark} because they experience greater status
competition and individuals place a high value on what others think of
them]{.underline} (Pickett, and Wilkinson, 2010; Wilkinson and Pickett,
2018). Secondly, as income inequality rises, status differentials
between individuals do too; which can adversely affect social mixing and
cohesion across groups, thereby reducing levels of interpersonal trust
(Layte, 2012; Layte and Wheler, 2014).

It is noteworthy that the [burgeoning of **[psychological]{.mark}** and
emotional [disorders]{.mark} in high-income countries has [happened
against the backdrop of growing econ]{.mark}omie[s]{.mark}, rising
absolute incomes, [and the]{.mark} [implementation of
ev]{.mark}idence-[based]{.mark} mental health
[interventions]{.mark}]{.underline} (GBD 2019 Mental Disorders
Collaborators, 2022). To be clear, [the rise in prevalence]{.underline}
of such disorders [are]{.underline} not considered [the result
of]{.underline} material comforts and a higher general standard of
living per se, but rather [the **[individualism]{.mark}**,
**[competition]{.mark}**, social [**stratification** and]{.mark} ensuing
(social evaluative) [stress]{.mark} people experience from their sense
of losing out and falling behind even when winning]{.underline}
(Wilkinson and Pickett, 2018). A similar paradox has been evidenced by
Levine (Levine, 2008) who found that productivity and individualism have
double-edged consequences; people living in highly individualized
countries that have a faster pace of life (e.g. USA) experience a higher
standard of living but their fast-paced existence creates stress which
has consequences for health.

[The materialism promoted under capitalism only functions by continually
stimulating in people anxiety and insecurity that will never truly be
fulfilled by purchase]{.underline}. Not only are the poor in society
socially excluded, those that are able to conspicuously consume---the
more affluent---are not fulfilled by materialism either (see James,
1998, 2007, 2008). [The capitalism narrative---that consumption of more
things confers real satisfaction and guarantees a fulfilled
life]{.underline}---is challenged by experimental evidence showing that
materialistic messages have negative effects on individual and societal
well-being (Moldes and Ku, 2020). What is more[, human [wants are
difficult to satisfy]{.mark} because of the contrast effect; the
tendency for **[people]{.mark} to [compare what they have]{.mark}** (or
do not have) [against]{.mark} what [others]{.mark} have (i.e. social
comparison) and what they themselves have become accustomed to having
(i.e. adaptation).]{.underline} The pursuit of individual
[[success]{.underline}]{.mark} (relative to others) [endorsed [by
capitalism]{.mark} actively [encourages]{.mark} between person rivalries
which amount to intrinsically unproductive [zero-sum
games]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g. 'I want more money or more things than
my neighbours'). [The battle for relative success and status has limited
net gain for individuals and society as a whole, because for every
winner, there must be a loser; the pursuit of advantage for ourselves
results in a disadvantage on others.]{.underline} These psychological
principles go some way to explaining why [continued economic
[growth]{.mark} and rising incomes [have]{.mark} [**not
boosted**]{.mark} most people's [happiness]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
**[contentment]{.mark}**,]{.underline} once basic needs have been
fulfilled (Lane, 2000; Layard, 2005).

### Impact\-\--AT: Sustainability\-\--2NC

#### Capitalism is unsustainable, biased, and a tradeoff for human welfare -- socialism is the best alternative

**IESE Insight 21** \[IESE Insight; 2021; Business School of the

Creating a better world is within our reach, but it requires global
cooperation at unprecedented levels and system change

What's wrong with capitalism?

To paraphrase Winston Churchill, it could be said that **[[capitalism is
the worst economic system]{.underline}]{.mark}** except for all those
other systems that have ever been tried. With that in mind, here's a
limited look at just three of the many issues raised in "The Future of
Capitalism" course. As many speakers note, these issues are
interconnected in ways that are hard to separate out.

[[Problem 1. It's unsustainable: We're in danger of killing our
planet.]{.underline}]{.mark} Case in point: [[We've known]{.mark} about
[the environmental harms of extracting and burning fossil fuels for
decades]{.mark} now[, but the current capitalist system doesn't]{.mark}
seem capable of doing enough to [stop it.]{.mark}]{.underline}

From Amsterdam, Jennifer Morgan, the current Executive Director of
Greenpeace International, speaks to this: "One of the most perverse
ironies, which future generations will look back on, is not just that we
knew what was causing this climate breakdown and we didn't take
immediate action to stop it, but that [[our governments continue to
offer incentives and subsidies to the very industries that created the
crisis in the first place]{.underline}]{.mark}."

She explains that [[fossil fuels are still attracting three times as
much money in investments and subsidies as green solutions
are]{.underline}]{.mark}. "You don't cut emissions by bailing out
airlines."

Unfettered capitalism is extractive and our planet's resources are
finite, Morgan stresses. [[Success, in capitalistic terms, is measured
by growth which is not sustainable. **The system has encouraged
consumption beyond our planetary constraints.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

Unfettered capitalism is extractive and our planet's resources are
finite

[[Problem 2. It's rigged: Winners take almost all.]{.underline}]{.mark}
Evidence abounds that the easiest way to make a fortune these days is to
start with one. For one angle on the problem, look at CEO pay over
recent years. In order to align CEOs' incentives with shareholders',
much of CEOs' compensation has come in the form of stock options. With
the stock market soaring -- stoked recently by COVID-19 rescue packages
-- [[CEOs]{.mark} in particular [have amassed staggering amounts of
wealth, and many pay shockingly little in the way of
taxes.]{.mark}]{.underline} (By keeping their stock options invested and
taking out loans to amass more properties, billionaires' tax bills stay
scandalously low, as recent investigations indicate.)

There are many ethical, economic and social problems strongly associated
with exaggerated inequality. One is a "near-constant proliferation of
corporate scandals," to quote from recent research by Stephen J.
Smulowitz and John Almandoz titled "Predicting employee wrongdoing: The
complementary effect of CEO option pay and the pay gap." In this
quantitative study of U.S. banks from 2007 to 2013, the co-authors find
direct evidence that inflated CEO pay was associated with negative
behaviors of employees in the same firm. That is to say, cheating and
other ethical problems are proliferating most where pay gaps are widest.
That is probably because ethical decision-making gets replaced with
"what's in it for me," as feelings of unfairness and envy rise. This was
found especially when CEO option pay was high, which could be an
indication that the CEO's attention becomes focused more on the stock
price than on the company's control systems. The research highlights
that executive pay can influence wrongdoing both in terms of incentives
as well as social comparison.

[Negative feedback loops that exacerbate inequality threaten our social
fabric.]{.underline} Ray Dalio writes: "[[The pursuit of profit is ...
now producing a self-reinforcing feedback loop that widens the
income/wealth/opportunity gap to the point that capitalism... (is) in
jeopardy]{.underline}]{.mark}." In a widely shared post, Dalio observes
that resources are being shifted to "what the haves want relative to
what the have-nots want, which includes fundamentally required things
like good care and education for the have-not children."

Cheating and other ethical problems are proliferating most where pay
gaps are widest

[[Problem 3. GDP growth is emphasized at the expense of our
wellbeing.]{.underline}]{.mark} In most places, [GDP carries more weight
than Gross National Happiness]{.underline}, or wellbeing, as is measured
in Bhutan. As Zamagni says, **[[capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** as we
have it now **[[is "great at growth but not great for
development]{.underline}]{.mark}**." In other words, [[capitalism isn't
aimed at]{.underline}]{.mark} making sure that human beings flourish.
And by human flourishing, we're talking about basics like education,
healthcare, a just legal system, a healthy environment and other
[[foundations necessary for supporting the common
good]{.underline}.]{.mark}

[Consider affordable healthcare.]{.underline} This is a particular
problem in the United States, the setting for a growing number of
"deaths of despair." The phrase was made famous by economists Anne Case
and Nobel prizewinner Angus Deaton, authors of Deaths of Despair and the
Future of Capitalism. The world's richest country (measured by GDP, of
course) has some of the world's highest priced and hardest to access
healthcare, which actually contributes to its GDP but not to its
citizens' wellbeing. Life expectancy in the United States has been
declining due to opioid abuse, suicides and other acts of
self-destruction.

Case and Deaton's work has sparked new research lines -- for example,
"Housing wealth, health and deaths of despair" by UCLA's Ariadna Jou and
IESE's Nuria Mas and Carles Vergara, which links wealth and health
outcomes.

Capitalism as we have it now isn't aimed at making sure that human
beings flourish

[So what's the solution?]{.underline}

[As a social project,]{.underline} "The Future of Capitalism" course
aims to arm its students with inspiration for a better future. Speakers
emphasize solutions on many different levels -- [global, systemic,
national, organizational, local/communal and
familial/personal.]{.underline}

Global/system-level change. "[Creating a better world]{.underline} --
one that's greener, safer, happier and healthier -- is within our reach,
but it requires global cooperation at unprecedented levels," says
Greenpeace's Morgan. "And [[it does require system
change]{.underline}]{.mark}, not half-baked tweaks here and there. It
requires [new rules, new investments, not saving the old failed system
via adaptation or reform. Without fundamental changes in trade or
finance rules, for example, there can be no just economic
recovery]{.underline}."

In Morgan's view, **[[working within the current capitalist system has
blinded us to any alternatives]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The COVID-19
crisis "might just be the opening we need to allow alternative
socioeconomic models that have reemerged over the last decade to take
off and then take over," she says. Without advocating one particular
model, Morgan points to several sources of inspiration, including the
wellbeing economy (advocated by the Wellbeing Economy Alliance); the
principles of the People's Sustainability Treaty (advocated by the
Radical Ecological Democracy Network); the social solidarity economy
(advocated by Réseau intercontinental de promotion de l'économie sociale
solidaire); and the doughnut economy, a model in which regenerative and
distributive economic activity is carried out within the bands of an
"ecological ceiling" and a "social foundation" (the name comes from its
doughnut-shaped visual framework).

#### Harvey's wrong -- 5 Reasons

**Ellner \'20** \[Steve; July 15; retired professor from Venezuela's
Universidad de Oriente, currently an Associate Managing Editor of Latin
American Perspectives; Canadian Dimension; \"David Harvey's new thesis
is that 'capitalism is too big to fail.' Is it?\";
https://canadiandimension.com/articles/view/david-harveys-new-thesis-is-that-capitalism-is-too-big-to-fail-is-it\]

In my opinion, [[Harvey's statements fall short on several
grounds]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[First, a full discussion of]{.underline} the contradictions of
[twenty-first century capitalism exposes the fallacy of]{.underline} the
["too big to fail" thesis.]{.underline} Too big to fail [makes no sense
when a system is **[so much beyond repair that "propping" it entails
unbearable sacrifices for the entire population]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(such as getting the public and private debt under control).
[[Harvey]{.underline}]{.mark} talks of contradictions in the system but
[[only]{.mark} [singles out]{.mark} inequality and environmental
destruction]{.underline}. [But these are just [two]{.mark}]{.underline},
and thus he leaves the impression that maybe we can live with the
contradictions and just try to soften their harsh effects. Even while
Harvey has no illusions about the destructiveness of capitalism, the
contradictions need to be brought into the center of any discussion
about future scenarios.

[[Marx demonstrated 150 years ago that the contradictions just get
deeper and deeper]{.underline}]{.mark}, even while there is the
appearance of greater prosperity. The contradictions in twenty-first
century capitalism are glaring: the mammoth public, private and
corporate debt; the huge chunk of the economy that produces junk or
destructive goods and services; the fact that the alteration of the
40-hour work week which has become more like 55 or 60 hours for so many
people, plus the massive incorporation of women into the workforce,
occurs at a time when technological developments (computers, AI, etc.)
should be reducing the work week at least by half. [[Above all, Harvey
leaves imperialism completely out of the picture]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Another contradiction has to do with]{.mark}
fiscalization]{.underline}, namely [[the gap]{.underline}]{.mark}
(though not a complete divorce) [[between the financial]{.mark}
[economy]{.mark}]{.underline}, with Wall Street recording
record-breaking gains, and Main Street, [[with]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
stagnation, if not [worsening, of economic conditions for the majority
of the population]{.mark}]{.underline} over the past 40 years. This gap
has reached a new threshold in recent weeks with the stock market's
recovery at a time of massive unemployment catalyzed by the pandemic.

The very profundity of these contradictions points to the opposite
conclusion that Harvey has reached: **[[far from being "too big to
fail," capitalism,]{.mark} given these objective conditions[, has never
been so weak.]{.mark}]{.underline}** In fact, if it weren't for
unfavorable political conditions, namely the weaknesses of the organized
left and labor movement worldwide, one could almost say that
**[[capitalism is on its last leg.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[[Second]{.underline}]{.mark}, the very profundity of [[these
contradictions points to the opposite conclusion]{.underline}]{.mark}
that Harvey has reached [[regarding "propping up" the
system]{.underline}]{.mark}. In fact, Harvey makes it seem as if we, the
people, can act to avoid an economic catastrophe by "propping up"
capitalism. [Marx posited the "anarchy of production" which means that
[no government, and no capitalist, can prevent economic]{.mark}
[crises]{.mark}]{.underline}. And so why does Harvey think that the
people of good will can prevent a collapse?

[Third]{.underline}, very few people on the left, if any, are claiming
that this is a revolutionary moment favorable for the seizure of power
in the United States or any other developed nations. So Harvey isn't
saying anything we don't already know. The key issue is whether reforms
here and there are going to do the job and, if not, what do you tell
people. Do you tell people to relax and be satisfied with the crumbs? Or
do you tell people that real change, sooner or later, is an historical
imperative, an idea that is completely lacking from Harvey's lecture.
[[If you caution people against systemic change]{.mark}, and allege that
such an aspiration is irresponsible, [then the claim that you are an
enemy of the existing system loses all credibility]{.mark}]{.underline},
as do your credentials of being an anti-capitalist.

Indeed, the problem with Harvey's thesis is not one of timing, of
waiting for the right moment for systemic change. When he says
"capitalism is too big to fail," it's not a matter of timing, unless you
think capitalist enterprises are going to get smaller in the future and
that the corporations will get broken up. Reformism is absolutely the
issue. [If you don't think that the system can ever be changed, then
what are you left with?]{.underline} I'm not one who despises reformists
but I do think they are deceiving people. [[If the contradictions are
just getting greater and greater, then saying capitalism is too big to
fail is ignoring reality]{.underline}]{.mark}. Does anyone believe that
the debt of the private, public and corporate sectors is going to
diminish in time? Everything to the contrary (US\$3 trillion added on in
just the past two months). Does anyone believe that under capitalism the
work week is going to be reduced? For many it has increased. Does anyone
believe that under capitalism we are going to be able to turn the
environmental problem around? These are the issues that Harvey should
have been dealing with in his effort to paint a picture of what the
world may look like in the future.

[[Fourth, Harvey assumes that the process of revolution will involve a
total and protracted breakdown where]{.underline}]{.mark}by the nation,
or [[the world, will be "stuck with a situation in which...]{.mark}
almost [all of us would starve."]{.mark}]{.underline} In fact, [[there
is no way to know what a revolution]{.underline}]{.mark} in an advanced
industrial country [[is going to look like,]{.mark} [because it has
never happened before]{.mark}]{.underline}. But nowhere in Harvey's
lecture is there a word about transitioning to socialism.

And [[fifth]{.underline}, [Harvey's statement that the overthrow of
capitalism "will not happen]{.underline}]{.mark}["]{.underline} requires
a more cohesive discussion of subjective conditions than what he
presents. Harvey would probably not be saying what he says about the
durability of the capitalist system and the need to defend it if a
vigorous well-organized leftist movement, combined with ongoing social
protests, prevailed at the international level. So the issue of the
anti-hegemonic movement is quite relevant.

In his discussion of the effervescence of social movements throughout
the world, Harvey appears to be both optimistic and pessimistic. He
notes how widespread protest movements have become, both geographically
and issue-wise. But he also points out [[that "mass mobilizations
generally don't last that long. Most... occur, then they quiet down, and
people forget about them]{.mark},]{.underline} and then they erupt
again." He goes on to underscore the fragmentation of the movements,
"that different [[groups]{.underline}]{.mark} participate in these mass
mobilizations but [[don't actually coordinate
together]{.underline}]{.mark}." Then, on an optimistic note, Harvey
suggests that "what we now see is perhaps the beginnings of the signs in
all of these cases of the coming together" of those who favor a social
democratic model in place of a neoliberal one.

[H[owever, the social movements such as]{.underline}]{.mark} [Seattle,
Spain's Indignados, the Occupy movement, [the anti-gun violence movement
of high school students, the #MeToo movement, the Black Lives Matter
movement etc. have not really been as ephemeral as they may
appear]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, the
[[slogan]{.underline}]{.mark} of the 99% put forward by the Occupy
movement [[has become]{.mark} very much a [part of discourse]{.mark} and
not just on the left]{.underline}.

What is really lacking is what Marxists refer to as the "subjective"
factor. That is, a leftist political party (or parties) that is able to
connect the dots and unify different struggles beyond a social
democratic project. The FBI understands the danger of this well, which
is why what they call the "messiah," that is certain charismatic
leftists (and even non-leftist ones), end up becoming a target. The
messiah is a leader with a capacity to unify the underclass, the working
class and sectors of the middle class, across race and ethnic lines,
etc. to bring about change rejected by the ruling class. I first heard
of the term in an interview with a biographer (Jeffrey Haas) who
indicated that Black Panther leader Fred Hampton was bumped off
precisely because the FBI saw him as that type of leader. Martin Luther
King and Malcolm X were both assassinated precisely when they began
reaching out to larger groups. But what is needed is not a leader who
can somehow make the revolution happen. What is lacking is a political
party that can unify between different movements, different demands,
different slogans, and different social, racial and ethnic groups.

To get back to Harvey, [[it is surprising that]{.mark} at this moment,
[when dire circumstances have generated a degree of hope, with]{.mark}
the Black Lives Matter protests and such [widespread disillusionment
with the]{.mark} [system]{.mark}, [that Harvey comes up with this line
of thinking]{.mark}]{.underline}. There was a time with the electoral
defeat of the Sandinistas in 1990, and then the collapse of the Soviet
Union, when some people on the left such as Marta Harnecker spoke of the
end of the anti-imperialist cycle. But then Chávez came along and Marta,
among others, revised her thinking. A similar
[[reconsideration]{.underline}]{.mark} or clarification [[on Harvey's
part would be]{.mark} [much in order]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### It's [unsustainable]{.underline}. COVID marks the [shift]{.underline} to a [new era]{.underline} of unsustainable capitalism. 

**Albert '24** \[Michael, lecturer in International relations, SOAS
University of London, Navigating the Polycrisis: Mapping the Futures of
Capitalism and the Earth, "The Planetary Crisis," Ch. 1\]

One way to articulate the root of the problem is that [the neoliberal
assault on working-class power]{.underline}, by creating a situation of
skyrocketing inequality and stagnant wages, [created **immense
pressure** to rely on financial **[deregulation]{.mark}**]{.underline}
and easy credit in order [to]{.underline} "[[sustain
demand]{.underline}]{.mark} in an economy suffering [from
**demand-deficiency** syndrome]{.underline}."87 [In the lead-up
to]{.underline} [the]{.underline} 2007--20[**08** financial
crisis]{.underline}, for instance, US [consumer demand]{.underline}---a
key driver of global economic growth---[was]{.underline} largely
[propped up by the **wealth effect** generated by a]{.underline}n
unsustainable [housing boom, which was]{.underline} itself [fueled by
a]{.underline}n opaque and [**brittle** financial
**[superstructure]{.mark}**]{.underline} underpinned by mortgage
securitization. In this sense, [the]{.underline} 2007--[2008
crisis]{.underline}, while originating in the financial system, [was the
symptom of a deeper structural **malaise**]{.underline} in global
capitalism: [a condition]{.underline}, as Tooze writes, in
[which]{.underline} it [must]{.underline} continuously [[rely
on]{.underline}]{.mark} "[**abnormal** [financial
bubbles]{.mark}]{.underline}" in order [[to]{.underline}]{.mark}
"[[achieve]{.underline}]{.mark} no more than [a **'normal' rate** of
[growth]{.mark}]{.underline}."88 The 2007--2008 financial crisis led to
stronger regimes for supervising financial systemic risk and ensuring
adequate capital buffers for systemically important financial
institutions, thus reducing the risks of banking crises. But the
[quantitative [easing]{.mark}]{.underline} programs [and
near-zero]{.underline} interest [rates]{.underline} pursued by central
banks [had the]{.underline} primary [effect of
**[funnel]{.mark}ing**]{.underline} more [[money
into]{.underline}]{.mark} financial [**[speculation]{.mark}**; propping
up **asset prices**]{.underline} for the investor class;
[and]{.underline} [[fueling]{.mark} increased
**[risk-taking]{.mark}**]{.underline} among hedge funds, pension funds,
asset managers, and others seeking higher returns in a near-zero or
negative interest rate environment.89 As a result, during the period
[between]{.underline} the [2008]{.underline} financial crisis
[and]{.underline} the [2020]{.underline} pandemic, [inequality only
**increased**]{.underline}--- with the top 1% capturing 95% of the gains
from economic growth since 2009---[and growth remained]{.underline}
precariously [reliant on **near-zero**]{.underline} interest [rates,
unprecedented **debt**]{.underline} levels, [and asset
**bubbles**]{.underline}.90 [[These]{.mark} problems]{.underline} only
[[got worse]{.mark} as a result of **[COVID-19]{.mark}**]{.underline}
and the crisis-fighting measures pursued by rich countries: [inequality
reached **new heights**]{.underline}, with the richest 1% capturing
nearly two-thirds of wealth generated since 2020; [corporations were
holding]{.underline} over [\$5 trillion]{.underline} in cash by the end
of 2020, [which they were funneling]{.underline} mainly [into
**speculation**]{.underline} more than productive investment (e.g., on
real estate, tech stocks, and cryptocurrencies); central banks brought
interest rates back to near-zero after a brief trend toward
"normalization" between 2017 and 2019; and total
[[debt]{.underline}]{.mark} levels [[reached]{.mark} a historically
unprecedented **[360%]{.mark}**]{.underline} of global GDP.91

Global [[capitalism]{.mark} has]{.underline} thus [been]{.underline}
~~limping~~ [\[**struggling**\] along]{.underline} thanks in large part
[to an **[unsustainable]{.mark}** regime of low]{.underline} interest
[rates and easy credit, which may]{.underline} now [be **[coming to an
end]{.mark}**]{.underline} via the 2022 inflation shock.
[The]{.underline} world economy [experienced a rapid yet **uneven
recovery** from]{.underline} the pandemic **[lockdowns]{.underline}** in
2021, with global GDP rising 6% after a 3% contraction in 2020.
[This]{.underline} rapid [recovery]{.underline}, [along with lingering
supply-chain difficulties and a **convergence** of
**stressors**]{.underline} in global food and energy markets (more on
this below), [set the stage]{.underline} for [the largest **surge**
of]{.underline} worldwide [inflation]{.underline} in nearly forty years,
which peaked at an annualized rate of 12.1% in October 2022.92
Mainstream economists typically view this as a problem of "excess
aggregate demand" or "too much money chasing too few goods," driven in
large part by the COVID-19 stimulus spending. But in reality, while
pandemic stimulus played a role, [the inflation surge has
been]{.underline} far more [a problem of **energy**]{.underline}, food,
and supply chain shocks, [followed by **profiteering** by powerful
corporations]{.underline}---[who react to upstream cost
increases]{.underline} either [by]{.underline} protecting or
[**amplifying** profit margins]{.underline}---followed in turn by
struggles among workers to prevent real wage declines.93 Non-financial
[[corporations]{.underline}]{.mark} across the global north
[[have]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [reaped **[record profits]{.mark}**,
while [wages]{.mark}]{.underline} among workers [have]{.underline} on
average [[**failed** to keep up]{.underline}]{.mark} with cost-of-living
increases.94 Despite this, while some European countries have turned to
unconventional policy measures like windfall taxes and even price caps,
for the most part [the inflation-fighting response remains dominated
by]{.underline} interest [rate hikes]{.underline} to put a damper on
consumer demand, investment, employment levels, and wages---thereby
[risking **recession**]{.underline}, financial [**instability**,
and]{.underline} further **[misery]{.underline}** for workers. The blunt
tools of central banks have struggled to get inflation under control,
which is projected to continue declining but at a slower rate than
previously expected: from 8.7% in 2022 to 7% in 2023 and 4.9% in 2024.95
But the social, economic, and political consequences of interest rate
hikes---meaning higher debt-servicing costs for a massively overindebted
world economy---are highly uncertain and a source of trepidation for
many.

Nouriel Roubini, for one, argues that [the]{.underline} world
[[economy]{.mark} is [headed for]{.mark}]{.underline} a period of
[**unprecedented [turbulence]{.mark}**. This could take the form
of]{.underline} cascading [**[debt crises]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} a
deep]{.underline} global [[recession]{.underline}]{.mark} triggered by
interest rate hikes, or sustained long-run inflation as central banks
pull back in order to prioritize financial stability.96 As Cedric Durand
puts it, central [[banks]{.mark} confront a choice between]{.underline}
financial [**[collapse]{.mark}** and "**slow-motion**
agony,"]{.underline} with the more likely scenario being "a real
devaluation of financial assets through a \[slow-motion\] crisis . . .
in the form of permanent mid-level inflation."97 Many analysts,
including the World Bank, agree that while inflation is likely to
decline in the near term, there is nonetheless a "growing risk that it
may remain elevated" for years to come as a result of several
headwinds--- including persistent energy and food supply shocks
(exacerbated by climate change); rising geopolitical tensions and
associated deglobalization trends (e.g., the trend toward "reshoring"
and/or "friend-shoring" manufacturing in critical industries, leading to
rising labor and production costs); and a shrinking labor supply due to
aging populations.98 While the outlook is far from certain, [the
reemergence of inflation]{.underline} may thus [signify a **[structural
shift]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the world economy [rather than a
**transitory blip**]{.underline} resulting from the COVID-19 crisis and
subsequent war in Ukraine. At best [this would [make it]{.mark} more
**[challenging]{.mark}**]{.underline} for technocratic elites [[to
manage]{.mark} the **deepening** [contradictions]{.mark} of
capitalism]{.underline}, given the trade-offs between reducing
inflation, ensuring financial stability, protecting growth and jobs, and
keeping the lid on populist unrest.99 At worst, it may set up global
capitalism for what Roubini calls the "the worst period of stagflation
the world has ever seen": a period of stubbornly high inflation, high
unemployment, and stagnant growth punctured by increasingly severe
recessions.100

#### Capitalism creates inevitable [boom-and-bust]{.underline} cycles that causes [falling]{.underline} rates of profitability\-\--makes collapses [inevitable]{.underline}. 

**Mizuoka '24** \[Fujio; December 24; Professor Emeritus at Hitotsubashi

Cycles, Falling Rates of Profit and the Dynamism of Capitalist Space,"
Ch. 8\]

[[Faced with **bottlenecks**]{.underline}]{.mark}, the prices of labour
power, the means of production and [monopoly **[rent]{.mark}** go [up
**rapidly**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The higher price of labour power is
also an outcome of the struggle of the organised labour which gained
strength during the period of prosperity. An [**[increasing]{.mark}**
amount of additional **[capital]{.mark}** is now absorbed [into]{.mark}
the process of **[maintaining]{.mark}** the continuity of
**[production]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The rising rate of interest, ground-rent and cost-prices of materials
erode the profit of enterprise. The congested means of transportation
and communication hinder spatial integration across the macro-economy,
and the process of capital reproduction becomes progressively confined
to the local level. This eventually leads to a minor form of crisis at
the local level and consequential "place-specific devaluations". At this
stage, unequal spatial development is mainly created due to the "fetter"
imposed by the means to annihilate space and constraint of the built
environment; behind this unevenness, the eve of economy-wide crisis now
quietly approaches.

The various [factors of **capitalist** production sound the
**ultimatum** to the **speculative** fever: [the
**crash**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Through an [absolute
**[overproduction]{.mark}** of capital, the reproduction [process
**collapses**]{.mark} to a great extent, and [ends]{.mark} "the
**[entire]{.mark}** interconnection of the reproduction
**[system]{.mark}** \[that\] rests on **credit**]{.underline}" (Capital,
Vol. 3, p. 621). Now, [[capitalists]{.mark} are [**forced** to
realise]{.mark} that [**all** attempts]{.mark}]{.underline} at subsuming
and annihilating space are [in fact
**[dysfunctional]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The agglomeration of production
and distribution facilities [**hampered** expanded
reproduction]{.underline} at the existing place owing to the "fetter" of
the built environment or the contradiction in the socio-spatial
dialectics. The [**means** of transportation and
communication]{.underline}, clogged or infested with incidents due to
overuse at the last moment of prosperity, [**blocks** rather than
facilitates the **reproduction**]{.underline} process as a whole. The
[**increased** amount of **capital** required to **maintain** the
continuity of **production**]{.underline} to ship products to distant
markets [lead to the very **overproduction**]{.underline} of capital as
it has absorbed a considerable amount of commodity capital. The credit
system, in [encouraging a **[speculative]{.mark}** fever and
[consequential fictitious demand **collapses**]{.mark} and ~~paralyses~~
**[destroys]{.mark}** the [flow of **capital**]{.mark}]{.underline}
circulation built on it. Ground-rent created out of the need of
capitalism to protect the system of private property, grabs the profit
of enterprise and even the immobile fixed capital privately owned by the
capitalists themselves. Finally, the [**[collapse]{.mark}** of the
credit system [brings]{.mark} the [land under **speculation** back
to]{.mark} almost a portion of absolute [space **without
value**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Nearly all means of subsuming and
annihilating space now betray their producers and rise against them.
Capitalism finally realises the dialectics of the annihilation of space
and the tough and unbeatable nature of absolute space. Distance, the
attribute of relative space, returns as the absolute barrier to the
reproduction process.

The loss that the crisis creates is "by no means uniformly distributed
amongst all the particular individual capitalists" but its distribution
is being "decided by a competitive struggle in which the loss is divided
very unevenly and in very different forms according to the particular
advantages or positions that have already won" (Capital, Vol. 2, p.
362). For example, places with greater agglomeration of the production
capital of the means of production suffer more than those with the means
of consumption, as the reproduction theory of capitalism suggests.

However, "under all circumstances ... the balance will be restored"
(ibid). The reproduction of capital now occurs on only a limited scale
and a limited spatial extent. Here, only the last and most effective
form of annihilating space, the elimination of pristine distance itself
by agglomeration, assists capitalists to maintain linkages in the
reproduction process. The place with the production capital for the
means of production can continue reproduction to some extent, since the
labourers, including those who lost their jobs due to the crisis, still
need a means to survive; and this [creates a **moment** for the
[beginning of **another cycle**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Much of the former
immobile fixed [**[capital]{.mark}** having been **[disposed]{.mark}**
of [through]{.mark} severe [**devaluation**, and]{.mark} sometimes
physical **[destruction]{.mark}**]{.underline}, space now takes a shape
closer to pristine. The power of the landed property opposing the
capitalist class abates. It thus [gives **capitalism** another
opportunity to "**restore** the balance"]{.underline} in space and to
produce its own spatial configuration on it, in a more intense and
efficient manner.

[**[T]{.mark}**endential **[f]{.mark}**all in the **[r]{.mark}**ate of
**[p]{.mark}**rofit]{.underline}

The start of [**another** business cycle accompanies the **emergence**
of new technology]{.underline} with a higher organic composition of
capital owned and [operated by capitalists of a **larger
scale**]{.underline} as well as a more extensive network of the built
environment for the production and spatial integration. [Another way of
**annihilating** space, the credit system, is **strengthened** and
streamlined to meet the **needs** of these larger
**capitalists**]{.underline}. This is the process in which the social
productivity of labour and the technical and organic compositions of
capital increase in proportion to living labour, as well as the larger
industrial and banking capital coming to dominate society.

[**[Continuous]{.mark}** technological [development brings]{.mark} about
a progressive [**decline** in]{.mark} the proportion of [**variable**
capital to **total** capital]{.mark}]{.underline}, and a consequential
rise in organic composition. Marx states:

> its development does ... involve a relative decline in the relation of
> variable capital to constant, and hence also to the total capital set
> in motion. This simply means that the same number of workers or the
> same quantity of labour-power that is made available by a variable

> production that develop within capitalist production, sets in motion,
> works up, and productivity consumes, with in the same period, an ever

This [**growth** of the mass of constant **capital**]{.underline} as
well as total capital [[**induces** a "**t**]{.mark}endential
**[f]{.mark}**all in the **[r]{.mark}**ate of

More recent '[[cybersocialist']{.mark} [proposals]{.mark} also [approach
planning as]{.mark} a **[computational]{.mark}** problem]{.underline},
building upon Kantorovich's work. Of particular significance here are
the contributions of Paul Cockshott (2019) whose work demonstrates the
applicability of optimal planning algorithms to supply side calculation.
He offers insights into how [[this]{.mark} [might not be]{.mark} as
computationally **[complex]{.mark}** as one would expect]{.underline}.
Klee and Minty (1970) had shown that, in worst case scenarios, [[the
**simplex algorithm**]{.mark} for [solv]{.mark}ing linear [programming
problems]{.mark} runs in exponential time, meaning that the time needed
to solve the problems scales exponentially with the number of
variables.]{.underline} Still, such [[**worst**-case **scenarios**
**rare**]{.mark}**ly** occur]{.underline} and for most practical
applications the simplex algorithm can be run in polynomial time and is
thus tractable. Cockshott (2019) and Dapprich (2020) both found that the
time needed to solve planning problems using the simplex method roughly
scales with n3 . [Cockshott]{.underline} (2019) also tested his own
[harmony algorithm and suggests that [it scales with nlog(n),]{.mark}
hence is even faster.]{.underline} While plans have so far only been
calculated for test economies with few variables, the author projected
that [[a modern **supercomputer**]{.mark} could [calculate a plan
covering five]{.mark} successive planning [years for an econ]{.mark}omy
disaggregated to **[200 million products in 22
minutes]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Cockshott 2019, 314). Cockshott and
Cottrell's model evaluates factors of production in terms of Marxist
labor values. By contrast, Dapprich's model, like that of Kantorovich,
is based upon shadow prices (Dapprich 2022). Dapprich's approach
recognizes that shadow prices are a better measure of opportunity cost
because they consider constraints, such as limited supplies of natural
resources, that cannot be reduced to labor time.

#### It can adapt to real-time changes.

As Austrian scholars point out (Boettke and Candela 2023[), the
[key]{.mark} [question for]{.mark} the socialist calculation problem [is
how production]{.mark} functions [and]{.mark} the plan they are [used to
**calculate**]{.mark} might be adjusted to changing
conditions.]{.underline} Supply side examples of such changing
circumstances include [[shifts in]{.mark} levels of factor
[supplies]{.mark} [and availability]{.mark} affected by a range of
variables, [from]{.mark} [**weather** conditions to]{.mark} public
**[health]{.mark}**, from **[migration]{.mark}** patterns [to]{.mark}
[**ecosystem** chang]{.mark}e]{.underline}. At the same time the set of
technologically feasible production technologies is constantly
progressing. There is potential though [[for a
**cybersocialist**]{.mark} approach to be used to adjust the plan in the
face of such changing conditions]{.underline}. If, as Cockshott (2019,
13) suggests, [[the time it takes to]{.mark} [calculate a new plan
is]{.mark} in the order of [22 minutes]{.mark}, [this could]{.mark} in
principle [be done regularly]{.mark}, for example on a daily
basis]{.underline}, should conditions change so quickly. 3 The viability
of this approach would of course depend on a number of contingent
factors such as computational speed and the process [[through
which]{.mark} multiple possible production **[functions are identified,
developed and added]{.mark}** to the model.]{.underline}

In the twenty-first century, as [[**capitalism** enters an]{.mark} epoch
of [unprecedented **crisis**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[it is time to
reconsider the]{.underline}]{.mark} Marxian theory of [proletarian
**[revolution]{.mark}**]{.underline}. More precisely, it is time to
critically reconsider it, to [determine if it has to be
**revised**]{.underline} in order [to]{.underline} speak [more
**directly** to]{.underline} our own time and [our own
**struggles**]{.underline}. It was, after all, conceived in the
mid-nineteenth century, in a political and social context very different
from the present. Given the long span of time from then to now, one
might expect it to require a bit of updating. In this article I'll argue
that it does need to be revised, both for a priori reasons of
consistency with the body of Marx's thought and in order to make it more
relevant to the contemporary scene. That is, I'll argue that [when
**Marx** conceptualized revolution in terms of]{.underline} a fettering
of the productive forces by **[production relations]{.underline}**, as
well as in terms of a "dictatorship of the proletariat," [he was the
**victim** of]{.underline} both [analytical **imprecision**]{.underline}
and a misunderstanding [of his own system]{.underline}. Accordingly, I
will amend Marx's conception of revolution. What we'll find is that the
correction not only makes the theory more cogent but updates it for our
own time, in such a way that it can teach activists strategic lessons.

In brief, I'll conclude that in order to make the Marxist notion of
revolution consistent with the premises of historical materialism it is
necessary, if not to reject, at least to qualify the statist perspective
to which Marx and Engels were committed, and which they transmitted to
their successors. As I've argued in Worker Cooperatives and Revolution:
History and Possibilities in the United States (chapters 4 and 6),\[1\]
[[it is **necessary** to conceive of revolution in a **gradualist**
way]{.underline}]{.mark}, [not as a]{.underline} sudden, single
historical "**[rupture]{.underline}**" [in which the **working
class**]{.underline} or its representatives [**take over** the state and
organize social reconstruction on the basis of a **unitary political
will**]{.underline} (the proletarian dictatorship). According to a more
realistic Marxism, even [the **early stages** of]{.underline} the
[**transition** from capitalism]{.underline} to post-capitalism [must
take place over **generations**]{.underline}, and not in a
straightforwardly planned way but somewhat unconsciously, in a process
slightly comparable to the transition from feudalism to capitalism. I
will also argue that [my revision can be the **basis** for]{.underline}
a partial [**rapprochement** between Marxists and
anarchists]{.underline}.

The Marxist Theory of Revolution

Marx has, in effect, two theories of revolution, one that applies only
to the transition from capitalism to socialism and another that is more
transhistorical, applying, for instance, also to the earlier transition
between feudalism and capitalism. The former emerges from his analysis
of capitalist economic dynamics, according to which a strong tendency
toward [class [**polarization** divides society]{.mark}]{.underline}, in
the long run, [[between]{.underline}]{.mark} a [small
**[elite]{.mark}**]{.underline} of big capitalists [[and]{.mark} a huge
**[majority]{.mark}** of]{.underline} immiserated
**[workers]{.underline}**, [who]{.underline} finally [succeed in
**overthrowing** the capitalist state]{.underline} and organizing a
socialist one. It is the transhistorical theory, however, that I will
focus on here. Its locus classicus is the following passage from the
Preface to A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy (1859):

...At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of
society come into conflict with the existing relations of production
or---this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms---with the
property relations within the framework of which they have operated
hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these
relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an era of social
revolution. The changes in the economic foundation lead sooner or later
to the transformation of the whole immense superstructure.

These sentences have inspired reams of commentary and criticism, but for
our purposes a few critical remarks will suffice. First of all, they are
clearly the barest of outlines, desperately in need of elaboration.
Unfortunately, nowhere in Marx's writings does he elaborate them in a
rigorous way. Second, the ideas are stated in functionalist terms, which
is one reason exponents of Analytical Marxism have criticized them.
Revolution happens supposedly because the productive forces---i.e.,
technology, scientific knowledge, and the skills of the labor
force---have evolved to such a point that production relations are no
longer compatible with their socially rational use and development. But
what are the causal mechanisms that connect this functionalist concept
of "fettering of the productive forces" to social revolution? As far as
I know, nowhere does Marx express his theory in causal, as opposed to
functionalist, terms.

Perhaps the biggest problem is that, as it is stated above, the theory
comes perilously close to meaninglessness. How does one determine when
production relations have started to impede the use and development of
productive forces? It would seem that to some extent they are always
doing so. In capitalism, for example, one can point to the following
facts: (1) [[recurring **recessions**]{.mark} and **depressions**
[periodically make **useless**]{.mark}]{.underline} much [[of
society's]{.mark} productive [capacity]{.mark}]{.underline}; (2)
enormous amounts of [[resources are **wasted** on]{.underline}]{.mark}
socially useless advertising and marketing
**[[campaigns]{.underline}]{.mark}**; (3) there is a [[lack]{.mark} of
[**incentives** for capital to invest in **public
goods**]{.mark}]{.underline} such mass transit, the provision of free
education, and public parks; (4) the [recent
**[financialization]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the Western economy has
[[entailed **investment**]{.underline}]{.mark} not in the improvement of
infrastructure but [[in glorified **gambling**]{.underline}]{.mark} that
doesn't benefit society; (5) [artificial [obstacles]{.mark} such as
**i**ntellectual co**p**yright laws [hinder]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[[development]{.underline}]{.mark}** and diffusion [[of
**knowledge**]{.mark} and **tech**nology]{.underline}; (6) a colossal
level of [[expenditures is **devoted** to]{.underline}]{.mark} war and
[**[destructive military]{.mark}** technology]{.underline}; (7) in
general, **[capitalism]{.underline}** [distributes resources in
a]{.underline} profoundly **[irrational]{.underline}**
[way]{.underline}, such that, for example, hundreds of millions of
people starve while a few become billionaires. Despite all this,
however, no transition to a new society has happened.

Indeed, in other respects capitalism continues to develop productive
forces, as shown by recent momentous advances in information technology.
It's true that most of this technology was originally developed in the
state sector;\[2\] nevertheless, the broader economic and social context
was and is that of capitalism. It is therefore clear that a mode of
production can "fetter" and "develop" productive forces at the same
time, a fact Marx did not acknowledge.

In order to salvage his hypothesis quoted above, and in fact to make it
quite useful, a slight revision is necessary. [[We have to
**replace**]{.mark} his idea of a [conflict between **productive
forces**]{.mark} and production relations]{.underline}
[[with]{.underline}]{.mark} that of [a [**conflict** between two sets of
**production relations**]{.mark}]{.underline}, one of which uses
productive forces in a more socially rational and "un-fettering" way
than the other. This change, trivial as it might seem, has major
consequences for the Marxist conception of revolution. It is no
exaggeration to say that, in addition to making the theory logically and
empirically cogent, [it changes its entire **orientation**]{.underline},
[from advocating a]{.underline} "**[dictatorship]{.underline}** of the
proletariat" [that seizes power before]{.underline} the [social
**revolution**]{.underline}, which it then plans out and executes,
[to]{.underline} advocating [a **long-term** evolution of **social
movements**]{.underline} that remake the economy and society from the
ground up---albeit with the crucial assistance of a slowly transforming
state.

My revision of the theory, then, is simply that [[at **certain** moments
in history]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[**new** forces]{.mark} and relations
of production [**evolve** in an older]{.mark}]{.underline} economic,
social, political, and cultural [[framework]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[undermining]{.mark} it [from **within**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The
gradual process of **social revolution**]{.underline} begins to [happen
when the **old** set of production relations **fetters**]{.underline},
or irrationally uses, productive forces in relation to the new set of
widely emerging production relations. The "in relation to..." that I
have added saves the Marxian theory from meaninglessness, for it
indicates a definite point at which the "old" society really begins to
yield to the "new" one, namely when an emergent economy has evolved to
the point that it commands substantial resources and is clearly more
"effective" in some sense than the old economy. The first time such a
radical transformation ever happened was with the Neolithic Revolution
(or Agricultural Revolution), which started around 12,000 years ago. As
knowledge and techniques of agriculture developed that made possible
sedentary populations, the hunter-gatherer mode of production withered
away, as did the ways of life appropriate to it.

\<\<\<Condensed, None Omitted\>\>\>

Similarly, starting around the thirteenth century in parts of Europe, an
economy and society organized around manorialism and feudalism began to
transform into an economy centered in the accumulation of capital.
Several factors contributed to this process, among them (1) the revival
of long-distance trade (after centuries of Europe's relative isolation
from the rest of the world), which stimulated the growth of merchant
capitalism in the urban interstices of the feudal order; (2) mercantile
support for the growth of the nation-state with a strong central
authority that could dismantle feudal restrictions to trade and
integrated markets; (3) the rise, particularly in England, of a class of
agrarian capitalists who took advantage of new national and
international markets (e.g., for wool) by investing in improved
cultivation methods and enclosing formerly communal lands to use them
for pasturage; (4) the partly resultant migration of masses of the
peasantry to cities, where, during the centuries from the sixteenth to
the nineteenth, they added greatly to the class of laborers who could be
used in manufacturing; (5) the discovery of the Americas, which further
stimulated commerce and the accumulation of wealth.\[3\] In short, from
the thirteenth to the nineteenth centuries, capitalist
classes---agrarian, mercantile, financial, and industrial---emerged in
Europe, aided by technological innovations such as the printing press
and then, later on, by all the technologies that were made possible by
the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century. All this is just
to say that in the womb of the old society, new productive forces and
production relations evolved that were more dynamic and
wealth-generating than earlier ones. Moreover, on the foundation of
these new technologies, economic relations, and scientific discourses
arose new social, political, and cultural relations and ideologies that
were propagated by the most dynamic groups with the most resources,
i.e., the bourgeoisie and its intellectual hangers-on. My revision of
Marx's formulation of his hypothesis has another advantage besides
making the theory more meaningful: it also supplies a causal mechanism
by which a particular mode of production's "fettering of the productive
forces" leads to revolution---indeed, to successful revolution. The
mechanism is that the emergent mode of production, in being less
dysfunctional or more socially rational than the dominant mode,
eventually (after reaching a certain visibility in the society) attracts
large numbers of adherents who participate in it and propagandize for
it---especially if the social context is one of economic stagnation and
class polarization, due to the dominant mode of production's
dysfunctionality. Moreover, this latter condition means that, after a
long evolution, the emergent economic relations and their institutional
partisans will have access to so many resources that they will be able
to triumph economically and politically over the reactionary partisans
of the old, deteriorating economy. This, of course, is what ultimately
ensured the political success of the bourgeoisie in its confrontations
with the feudal aristocracy. Likewise, one can predict that if
capitalism continues to stagnate and experience massive crisis over the
next fifty years and more, a new, more cooperative and socialized mode
of production that has developed in the interstices and eventually the
mainstream of capitalist society will mount the summits of political
power. In short, my seemingly minor conceptual revision provides a
condition for the success of anti-capitalist revolution, and thus helps
explain why no such revolution so far has been successful in the long
run (namely because the condition has been absent). Another way of
seeing its implications and advantages is by contrasting it with the
views of orthodox Marxists. A single sentence from Friedrich Engels sums
up these views: "The proletariat seizes state power, and then transforms
the means of production into state property."\[4\] This statement,
approved by Lenin and apparently also by Marx, encapsulates the
ultra-statist perspective of the orthodox Marxist theory. This
perspective is briefly expressed in the Communist Manifesto, where Marx
writes, "The proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by
degree, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralize all instruments
of production in the hands of the State, i.e., of the proletariat
organized as the ruling class," and then lays out a ten-point plan of
social reconstruction by means of state decrees. By the 1870s Marx had
abandoned the specifics of his earlier plan, but his (qualified) statism
remained, and transmitted itself to his followers.\[5\] It is true that
orthodox Marxists and Leninists expect the state, "as a state," to
somehow (inexplicably) wither away eventually, but they do have a
statist point of view in relation to the early stages of revolution. The
statist vision emerges naturally from Marx's famous passage quoted
above, in that the idea of a conflict between the rational use and
development of productive forces and the fettering nature of current
production relations suggests that at some point a social "explosion"
will occur whereby the productive forces are finally liberated from the
chains of the irrational mode of production. Pressure builds up, so to
speak, over many years, as the mode of production keeps fettering the
socially rational use of technology and scientific knowledge; through
the agency of the working class, the productive forces struggle against
the shackles of economic relations; at long last they burst free, when
the working class takes over the state and reorganizes the economy.
These are the metaphors naturally conjured by Marx's above-quoted
Preface. But there are logical and historical problems with the statist
view, the view according to which the substance of social revolution
occurs after the seizure of state power. First of all, it is in tension
with the Marxian conception of social dynamics. Briefly stated, Marx
sees the economy---rightly, I think---as the relative foundation of the
rest of society, including the political sphere, which suggests that a
post-capitalist social revolution cannot just be politically willed and
imposed. This would seem to reverse the order of "dominant causality,"
from government to the economy rather than vice versa. Moreover, such
extreme statism exalts will as determining human affairs, a notion
incompatible with the dialectical spirit of Marxism.

According to "dialectics," [**[history]{.mark}** really
[happens]{.mark}]{.underline} "[[**behind** the
backs]{.underline}]{.mark}" of actors: [it [evolves]{.mark}]{.underline}
"**[[unconsciously]{.underline}]{.mark}**," so to speak, as Hegel
understood. [[Social]{.mark} and institutional [**conflicts** work
themselves out]{.mark}]{.underline}, slowly,
[[through]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[actions of **large numbers** of
people who]{.mark} generally [have **little idea** of the]{.mark} true
[historical **significance** of their acts]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Marx
said, we should never trust the self-interpretations of historical
actors. And yet he apparently suspends this injunction, and his whole
dialectical method, when it comes to the so-called proletarian
revolution. These historical actors are somehow supposed to have perfect
understanding of themselves and their place in history, and their
historical designs are supposed to work out perfectly and
straightforwardly---despite the massive complexity and "dialectical
contradictions" of society.

### Alternative\-\--Eco-Socialism\-\--1NC

#### The alternative is [eco-revolution]{.underline}.

Monthly Review, Professor of sociology at the University of Oregon

<https://monthlyreview.org/2018/09/01/making-war-on-the-planet/> // asw

As an extension of the current war on the planet, a [regime of climate
geoengineering designed to keep the present mode of production
going]{.underline} is sharply opposed to the view enunciated by Barry
Commoner in 1992 in Making Peace with the Planet, where he wrote: ["If
the environment is polluted and the economy is sick, the virus that
causes both will be found in the system of production."]{.underline}28
There can be no doubt today that [it is the [present **mode of
production**]{.mark}, particularly the system of fossil capital, that
**[needs to change]{.mark}** on a global scale.]{.underline} [In order
[to stop c]{.mark}limate [c]{.mark}hange, the [world econ]{.mark}omy
[must]{.mark} quickly [shift to zero]{.mark} net carbon dioxide
[emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is **[[well within
reach]{.underline}]{.mark}** with a concerted effort by human society as
a whole utilizing already existing sustainable technological
means---particularly when [coupled [with necessary changes in social
organizatio]{.mark}]{.underline}n to reduce the colossal waste of
resources and lives that is built into the current alienated system of
production. Such changes could not simply be implemented from the top by
elites, but rather would require the
[[self-mobilization]{.underline}]{.mark} of the population, inspired by
the revolutionary actions of youth [[aimed at egalitarian, ecological,
collective,]{.mark} and [socialized
solutions]{.mark}]{.underline}---recognizing that it is the world that
they will inherit that is most at stake. Today's necessary ecological
revolution would include for starters: (1) an emergency [[moratorium
on]{.mark} economic [growth]{.mark}]{.underline} in the rich countries
coupled with downward redistribution of income and wealth; (2) radical
reductions in greenhouse gas emissions; (3) rapid phase-out of the
entire fossil fuel energy structure; (4) substitution of an alternative
energy infrastructure based on sustainable alternatives such as solar
and wind power and rooted in local control; (5) massive cuts in military
spending with the freed-up economic surplus to be used for ecological
conversion; (6) promotion of circular economies and zero-waste systems
to decrease the throughput of energy and resources; (7) building
effective public transportation, together with measures to decrease
dependence on the private automobile; (8) [[restoration of global
ecosystems in line with]{.underline}]{.mark} local, including
[[indigenous]{.mark}, [communities]{.mark}]{.underline}; (9)
transformation of destructive, energy-and chemical-intensive
agribusiness-monocultural production into agroecology, based on
sustainable small farms and peasant cultivation with their greater
productivity of food per acre; (10) institution of strong controls on
the emission of toxic chemicals; (11) prohibition of the privatization
of freshwater resources; (12) imposition of strong,
human-community-based management of the ocean commons geared to
sustainability; (13) institution of dramatic new measures to protect
endangered species; (14) strict limits imposed on excessive and
destructive consumer marketing by corporations; (15) reorganization of
production to break down current commodity chains geared to rapacious
accumulation and the philosophy of après moi le déluge; and (16) the
[[development of]{.underline}]{.mark} more rational,
**[[equitable]{.underline}]{.mark}**, less wasteful, and more
[[collective forms of production]{.underline}]{.mark}.29 Priority in
such an eco-revolution would need to be given to the fastest imaginable
elimination of fossil fuel emissions, but this would in turn [[require
fundamental changes in]{.underline}]{.mark} the human [[relationship to
the earth]{.underline}]{.mark} and in the relationship of human beings
to each other. A new emphasis would have to be placed on sustainable
human development and the creation of an organic system of social
metabolic reproduction. [[Centuries of]{.underline}]{.mark} exploitation
and expropriation, including [[divisions]{.underline}]{.mark} on the
basis of class, gender, race, and ethnicity, would [[have to be
transcended]{.underline}]{.mark}. The historical logic posed by current
conditions thus points to the necessity of a long **[[ecological
revolution]{.underline}]{.mark}**, putting into place a new system of
sustainable human development aimed at addressing the totality of needs
of human beings as both natural and social beings: what is now called
**[[ecosocialism]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### Only a move towards socialism can reduce emissions -- offsets, carbon credits, and green capitalism based in a capitalist system all fail.

the article reviews *Socialism or Extinction: Revolution in a Time of
Ecollogical Crisis* by Martin Empson; Solidarity, July 16, 2025.) //FF

Martin Empson's new book Socialism or Extinction: Revolution in a Time
of Ecological Crisis is an accessible explanation of why [[only a
socialist revolution]{.underline}]{.mark}---where workers seize control
of their workplaces and run the economy democratically---[[can stop
capitalism from]{.mark} [destroying the world in its endless drive for
profit]{.mark}]{.underline}[s.]{.mark} It guides readers through many of
the common debates in the climate movement. Empson takes care to build
his argument from the ground up. For this reason, it is a worthwhile
read for anyone involved in climate activism. He argues that [disastrous
[climate change is]{.mark} an [inevitable]{.mark} product [of
the]{.mark} inner [working of capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline} [as an
economic system]{.underline}. He writes, "[All]{.underline} [[capitalist
production requires]{.mark} the use of [natural resources
through]{.mark} the [exploitation of human labour]{.mark}. Because
competitive accumulation is central to capitalist production, there is
no limit on the system's degradation of nature]{.underline}." [[Fossil
fuels are central to capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}, he argues, with
[fossil fuel [corporations]{.mark}]{.underline} including [[energy
companies and car manufacturers]{.underline}]{.mark}
[m[ak]{.underline}]{.mark}[ing [up the bulk of the]{.mark} world's
[largest companies]{.mark}]{.underline}. Their total wealth, he writes,
"is staggering" so that "BP, for instance, had a net income in 2021 of
\$8.5 billion and total assets of over \$287 billion." The book also
traces why fossil fuels became so embedded in the system, looking at the
way the steam engine powered by coal helped drive forward the industrial
revolution, and how the use of coal and oil by European colonial powers
allowed them to control the world through steamships and later more
advanced battleships and aircraft. He [[dismisses any hopes
of]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[green capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark},
looking at how [[market-based solutions such as carbon credits or
offset]{.mark}]{.underline} schemes, which [[have made no dent in
reducing emissions]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[can]{.underline}]{.mark}
potentially [[encourage more]{.underline}]{.mark} fossil fuel
[[investments]{.underline}]{.mark}. These scams have been at the heart
of all the carbon markets and emissions trading schemes that were
supposedly designed to reduce emissions. As Empson writes, "These
schemes are attractive to the capitalists because they appear to offer a
way of dealing with climate change while allowing capitalist production
to continue as normal."

that all [too often]{.underline} has been [[accepted by people who

Rather than a short-term focus on corporate profits, an [[eco-socialist
society]{.mark} can [anticipate and prepare for]{.mark} the predictable
[effects of climate change]{.mark}]{.underline}. Eco-socialism has the
potential to [provide]{.underline} the [[future-oriented planning
that]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[climate]{.underline}]{.mark} adaptation
[challenge]{.underline} [[demands]{.underline}]{.mark}. To do so, an
eco-socialist society [[must be]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[[democratic]{.underline}]{.mark} one. Adaptation [[planning and
implementation]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[serve]{.underline}]{.mark} the
broad mass of [[humanity]{.underline}]{.mark} [in all parts of the
world]{.underline} [requires]{.underline} [inclusive decision-making
processes]{.underline}. [[Otherwise]{.underline}]{.mark},
[those]{.underline} who are likely to be [[most heavily affected
by]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[climate]{.underline}]{.mark} crisis
[[will]{.underline}]{.mark} also be the ones [[receiv]{.mark}ing [the
least help]{.mark},]{.underline} [a situation that already
exists]{.underline}. Long experience shows that
[[criticizing]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[practices]{.mark} and
priorities]{.underline} of corporations, multilateral development
agencies, and development assistance programs [[has only marginal
effect]{.underline}.]{.mark} The problem lies in the [[concentration of
wealth and power]{.underline}]{.mark} in a few hands, effectively
[[deny]{.mark}ing democratic [voice to billions]{.mark}]{.underline} of
people. This [state]{.underline} of affairs [is]{.underline}
[unavoidable in [today's global capitalist world
order]{.mark}]{.underline}, which invariably [[harms the
environment]{.underline} [and disproportionately
prioritizes]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [interests of the top]{.mark} one
percent]{.underline}. As the climate crisis worsens, the world's [[power
and resources may be]{.underline}]{.mark} increasingly [[directed toward
defending]{.underline}]{.mark} the rule of
[[capital]{.underline}]{.mark}. A remedy for this could be the
institution of [democratic rule]{.underline} [by]{.underline} the
[associated producers]{.underline} -- that is, [genuine]{.underline}
democracy, without which adaptation will mean little more than
"ever-bigger sea walls around Manhattan" (Uncapher and Yvellez
Citation2019), thus [[push]{.mark}ing]{.underline} the [[heavy costs
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[climate]{.underline}]{.mark} crisis [[onto
the most]{.underline} [vulnerable]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[In]{.underline}]{.mark} a genuine democratic [[eco-socialist
society]{.underline}]{.mark}, such [[exploitation would be
prevented]{.underline}]{.mark} because [every community]{.underline}
would [participate]{.underline} [in]{.underline} devising
[responses]{.underline} to the crisis, and values such as
[[community]{.underline} [and]{.underline}]{.mark} the full
[[development of the individual]{.underline}]{.mark} would [[carry more
weight than capital]{.underline}]{.mark} accumulation.

#### Proposals and movements are the only way to solve the drastic effects of capitalism -- other campaign tactics have failed the public or to address the roots of issues.

**Larkins** **22** (Member and author for socialist group, Solidarity

the article reviews *Socialism or Extinction: Revolution in a Time of

In the face of the lack of real action, a number of more radical groups
in the climate movement have concluded that [conventional campaign
tactics]{.underline} have [fail]{.underline}ed. Roger Hallam, one of the
founders of Extinction Rebellion, argues that [non-violent direct action
is the only way to win change]{.underline}, while author Andreas Malm
advocates violent tactics such as blowing up oil pipelines. Empson
contrasts these approaches with the success of [mass
mobilisations]{.underline} which [combine]{.underline} large-scale
[street marches with disruptive]{.underline} mass [direct
action]{.underline}. For instance, the [Standing Rock
campaign]{.underline} which [stopped]{.underline} the [construction
of]{.underline} the [Dakota Access Pipeline]{.underline} was, "led by
Indigenous people and supported by environmental activists, workers and
even military veteran groups." There were 15,000 people involved in the
protest camp at its height. But [to win permanent change]{.underline},
[we]{.underline} will [need mass movements on an even larger
scale.]{.underline} Empson discusses the various [proposals
for]{.underline} a Green New Deal and [massive state intervention to
build a sustainable society]{.underline}. [If all the world's resources
were put to use to immediately transition to renewable energy, we could
cut pollution extremely quickly]{.underline}. We [could ensure
sustainable practices in all]{.underline} of our
[industries]{.underline}, we could make energy free and available to
everyone. We could set to work on repairing the damage already done, and
ensure no one is left behind. But the [challenge of such
proposals]{.underline} to reform capitalism "[is getting them
implemented]{.underline}", he writes. Activists who advocate [getting
more progressive politicians into power]{.underline} or change within
the existing system under-estimate the forces we are up against.

Even while Love is the Message doesn't specifically reference
geoengineering, it onetheless offers a discernable [[**cry of protest**
against]{.underline}]{.mark} the latter's [[ambition to
**sustain**]{.mark} our [present]{.mark} culture with no alteration to
its governing [sociopolitical and economic
arrangements]{.mark}]{.underline}, with mitigation technology only
intervening at the level of regional weather control and atmospheric
waste management. By virtue of its montage, Jafa's video joins passages
of black death and police violence to close-up shots of angry sun
flares, as seen from NASA's International Space Station's near-live
feed, offering an insight common in environmental justice circles that
views global warming as a threat multiplier that exacerbates social
conflict and inequality. According to well-documented research,
[disenfranchised and impoverished communities of color experience higher
levels of exposure to climate-related disasters and their aftermath,
food and water shortages, major health risks, and other forms of
environmental vulnerability]{.underline}. 22 In this vein, it's feasible
to understand the video's footage of the alien's dripping secondary jaws
from Ridley Scott's 1979 classic, and those of the city-destroying
monster from Cloverfield, Matt Reeve's 2008 faux-found footage horror
film, as further allegories, serving to elevate the tragic-but-quotidian
documents of police violence and social oppression to the realm of
cosmopolitical significance, the arena where worlds are annihilated and
remade. In other words, any given police attack cannot be seen as a
stand-alone local event, but rather, by virtue of Jafa's stream of
collected footage, part of systematic and widespread violence, and more,
as a matter of civilizational threat akin to the horror of an alien
assault on planet earth. As such, the monstrous here is a story of
racial injustice, which Jafa sets in a post-natural dystopia resulting
from runaway climate change. The many film fables that the monstrous
proposes might also be read variously as representing the greedy and
senseless destruction of the world conducted by the rapacious power of
carceral capital, bolstered by police climate control, the colonization
of debt, and the chains of spectacle; the radical and threatening
otherness of racial difference become a predatory behemoth; alternately,
a justice-seeking revenge fantasy upon white supremacist culture by what
lies beyond recognition; or the materialization of contemporary fears of
a genetically and geoengineered Frankensteinian science in creating
post-natural dystopias and runaway climate change -- or indeed some
element of each all mixed together without articulate or stable meaning.
The Breakthrough Institute also references our "contemporary
Frankenstein" -- enlisting no less than Bruno Latour in its theoretical
armory, who argues that we must not disown the planetary monster we have
created -- the earth of the Anthropocene -- but rather learn to love and
care for it through further technological acts of "modernizing
modernization." 23 While Naomi Klein overlooks Latour's subtler call for
a "compositionist" modernity as "a process of becoming ever-more
attached to, and intimate with, a panoply of nonhuman natures," she
criticizes the presumptuousness of his proposal especially where it aids
in the Institute's proengineering agenda: ["The earth is not our
prisoner, our patient, our machine, or, indeed, our monster. It is our
entire world. And the [solution to global warming is]{.mark} not to fix
the world, it is [to fix ourselves]{.mark}."]{.underline} 24 Adding to
mounting [opposition to geoengineering]{.underline}, she highlights the
unintended side-effects (e.g. interfering in Monsoons in South Asia,
exacerbating drought in North Africa, widening the ozone hole); the lack
of any regulatory protocol for climate interventions with trans-national
implications; its lock-in effect making it next to impossible to abandon
the technology once it's been implemented; its anti-democratic basis in
an era of globalism led by a handful of powerful developed nations; and,
crucially, its directing of precious resources away from the causes of
climate disruption, in favor of addressing symptoms. 25 Indeed, in
recent years popular [**resistance** movements have formed around
climate justice]{.underline}, asserting the fundamental principle of
["**[system change]{.mark}**, not climate change," where justice means
dedication to **equality**, **fairness**, and the [**inclusion**
of]{.mark} the most [vulnerable]{.mark} and members of frontline
communities in the deliberation of climate solutions]{.underline}. Think
of the ongoing battle in central France to stop the new airport and
[[invent a **non-capitalist commons**]{.underline}]{.mark} at the Zad;
Standing Rock's ongoing opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline and
expression of [multi-national **resurgence** in the name of
**Indigenous** and environmental rights]{.underline}; the many examples
of Blockadia pitted [against fossil-fuel infrastructure and extraction
projects across the Americas]{.underline}, including protests in
Louisiana against the Bayou Bridge Pipeline, in British Columbia against
the Trans Mountain Pipeline, and those in Ecuador against oil drilling
in Yasuní National Park; and the European climate camps and the Ende
Gelände \[Here and No Further!\] movement in Germany, where the state is
currently threatening to tear down the ancient Hambach forest to dig for
coal, evicting activists along the way. 26 These are all [pledged
variously to the goal of **reinventing** forms of life by
**[refusing]{.mark}** the imperatives of **[capitalist growth]{.mark}**
and **market**-based mechanisms for addressing climate breakdown, even
while they also seek to **expand** the social technologies of
**equality** and **justice**]{.underline}. 27 But despite such momentum
and creative transitions, what's becoming clear with the ongoing
development of geoengineering is that massive resources and funding
bodies are mobilizing the technology under the star of the neoliberal
Anthropocene. 28 If anything, that formation parallels and joins the
same forces that support the militarization and technologization of
police functions, growing economic inequality and generalized
indebtedness, the privatization of and creation of for-profit prisons,
and the criminalization of protest, to the point where the criminal
justice complex increasingly treats both environmental and antiracist
activism as terrorism. 29 Consider Breakthrough Initiatives -- no
relation to the Institute other than sharing a trending term within the
field of competitive tech development -- which is one among many trying
to "save the planet" and motivated in doing so by what some see as a
\$12 trillion opportunity. 30 Funded in part by Facebook's Mark
Zuckerberg and Israeli-Russian venture capitalist Yuri Milner of Digital
Sky Technologies, and counting the late Stephen Hawking among its
collaborators, the project recently put \$100 million into a radio wave
project to search for alien life. 31 Led by a libertarian
entrepreneurialism that derides the outmoded and bureaucratic state
agencies of the Cold War, Breakthrough Initiatives is part of a growing
"colonial futurism" premised upon the neoliberalization of outer space.
It connects to the projects of Silicon Valley's modeling of "NewSpace,"
as in the rhetoric of Elon Musk, set on off-planet resource mining,
terraforming other planets, and extending property claims far into the
galaxy. 32 With the neoliberal corporate-military-state complex
determined to occupy and settle the very place that certain
Afrofuturists have long sought as a destination to escape colonized
Earth, such starry-eyed fantasies are quickly becoming grim futures.
Other initiatives focus their attention on Earth, representing how the
neocolonialist spirit haunts new wave environmentalism. There's ScoPex,
Harvard University's current \$20 million Stratospheric Controlled
Perturbation Experiment, notable for its first-ever plans to test solar
radiation management technologies outside the lab in the earth's
atmosphere above Arizona. Led by David Keith, Harvard professor of
applied physics, founder and board member of the private corporation
Carbon Engineering, and signatory of "An Ecomodernist Manifesto," the
project is supported by Microsoft's Bill Gates and his Fund for
Innovative Climate and Energy Research, as well as by the Hewlett
Foundation and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation (an appropriate
beneficiary, considering it is named for the longtime CEO of General
Motors). 33 Notable for its funding model joining university engineering
and climate-science research to [**Big Tech** and **fossil capital**,
ScoPex parallels a **marine cloud-brightening**]{.underline} field
experiment in Moss Landing, California, led by the Joint Institute for
the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean (JISAO) at the University of
Washington, directed by Thomas Peter Ackerman, Professor of Atmospheric
Sciences, with Paul Crutzen as a senior advisor. 34 With \$16 million in
funding from Gates and others, the project plans to shoot seawater
droplets into the atmosphere from a ship with high-pressure nozzles,
creating a solar shield to deflect sunlight. 35 In light of Cameroonian
theorist Achille Mbembe's diagnoses of creeping precaratization as "the
becoming-black of the world" -- meaning the post-racial generalization
of dispossession, indebtedness, and loss of powers of self-determination
-- geoengineering's desire to save the world by whitening the sky
reveals how completely detached the field is from the catastrophes
currently occurring on the ground in the here and now. 36 While
geoengineering may profess to stem from love of earth, its message is
death: the death of social justice, equality, and democratic inclusion.
The go-to guide for Zuckerberg and Gates is Yuval Noah Harari's recent
book Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow, which, tellingly, includes
a chapter titled "The Anthropocene." 37 Driven by an endless quest for
"bliss, immortality, and divinity," anthropos, in this narrative,
figures as ultimate self-creator, for whom no challenge -- climate
change, agricultural failure, artificial intelligence, planetary hunger,
even death and extinction -- will be beyond technological overcoming,
especially when matched to Silicon Valley capital. At the same time, the
cost will be greater inequality and technocracy, an expanding useless
class, a new religion of algorithmic "dataism," and the reduction of
humanity to "biochemical subsystems" monitored by global networks. More
prosaically, the Good -- read: Neoliberal -- Anthropocene emerges in
this and the Breakthrough Institute's narrations as the ideological
mechanism of choice for suspending contradictions between economic
growth and climate solutions. In fact, even climate-change denying Texas
Republicans can get on board with geoengineering as a not-to-be-missed
pro-tech economic opportunity, requiring no need to debate sources of
environmental transformation or hold petrocapitalism responsible, as
causality is sacrificed on the alter of techno-solutionism. While the
Trump administration has defied the scientific consensus on climate
change and supported fossil-fuel deregulations, its February 2018
budget, supported by many in congress, included the first-ever tax
breaks for new technologies of atmospheric carbon capture. Meanwhile,
the Hoover Institution, The Heartland Institute, and the American
Enterprise Institute -- all key conservative think-tanks -- support this
move, the latter hailing geoengineering as nothing less than "a
revolutionary approach to climate change." 38 Even more alarming is the
current conceptualization by Keith and others of
"counter-geoengineering," the counteracting of the militarization and
weaponization of climate manipulation technologies as deployed by
imagined rogue states or non-state actors. 39 This additional danger
dramatizes engineering's ungovernable status and potential for
destructive instrumentalization in the era of Homo Deus. Even more than
biologically regressive, neo-humanist and universalist, depoliticizing
and neocolonialist, Anthropocene geoengineering is proving most
threatening where techno-utopianism merges with military unilateralism
in proposing near-future global weather wars, going far beyond anything
imagined in the Cold War. While the horror of those systems are
devastatingly presented in Jafa's video, Love is the Message also
powerfully intercuts passages portraying the [remarkable resilience,
accomplishment, and beauty of African American culture -- despite all --
in activism, politics, speculative imagination, rhetoric, music, dance,
literature, athletics, and, profoundly, everyday forms of
creativity]{.underline}. The negative and the positive, love and death,
repeatedly and relentlessly oscillate and converge in explosive
combination in his piece, proposing something like a singular Vine
compilation of cutting philosophical import, or an Instagram feed of
alternating soul-destroying and restorative affects. Jafa terms it the
[**"the abject sublime,"** an extraordinary mix of beauty and horror,
issuing from an archive of black visual culture that seems infinite in
its range of experiences.]{.underline} For Jafa, this ultimately beyond
quantifiable record of being stems from an ontological construction
inseparable from the wake of transatlantic slavery. 40 Indeed, the
video's description-defying vastness, its overwhelming multivalence, is
signaled in Greg Tate's necessarily transgressive grammar used in
describing the piece: "The viral outgrowth of an aborted found-footage
exercise, the 7-minute video is an alternately
mirthful-cum-melancholic-cum-cardiac-arresting meditation on race-agency
wrapped in [a visually sermonic recitation of race tragedy wrapped in a
nuanced and feverish exultation of diverse Black American lives at
various states of collapse and regeneration]{.underline}." 41 Yet even
though the video offers an amazing account of generative ambivalence and
creative survival, even while it also gives rise to encompassing
hopefulness in collective moments of love, solidarity, ethical
conviction, and collective justice-seeking, it simultaneously
[[obliterates any consideration of]{.mark} extending or
[sustaining]{.mark} its [world of horror, one of]{.mark} beyond
grotesque [inequality, impoverishment, and violence]{.mark} that renders
Black life and lives matterless by the state and its techno-human
apparatuses]{.underline}. Unlike The Breakthrough Institute, which
proffers art and leisure as rewards, Jafa's sci-fi reaches the realm of
cosmopolitical magnitude without losing sight of vernacular instances of
in/justice, of [[**situated** expressions]{.mark} that are
future-oriented but historically informed, and which are dedicated to
the [reinvention of everyday life]{.mark}]{.underline}, art, culture,
politics, mourning. It follows, then, that Jafa would [extend solidarity
to a younger generation]{.underline} by including artist Martine Syms.
During her cameo, she reads from her 2015 "Mundane Afrofuturist
Manifesto," which reprises the longstanding black cultural aesthetic
that draws on [visions of a utopian time to come]{.underline}, one
reached only by passing through the [traumatic alienations of racial
capitalism]{.underline}. No simple time travel or shapeshifting is
possible, however. 42 ["Mundane Afrofuturists recognize that we are not
aliens,"]{.underline} Syms explains, while facing the camera seated
behind a desk. Jafa borrows the clip from Syms's eponymous documentary,
which, over the course of its hour-long duration, eschews what its
author sees as the depoliticized fantasies of past Afrofuturisms.
According to Syms, they have sunk into hackneyed fashions, commodifiable
styles and stale pop-cultural spectacles severed from any radical
imagination inspiring collective liberation. More, she [warns against
acritical escapism]{.underline}, as when "magic interstellar travel
and/or the wondrous communication grid" lead to "an illusion of outer
space and cyberspace as egalitarian." For her, "jive-talking aliens,"
"reference to Sun Ra," and "Egyptian mythology and iconography" are all
out, calling instead for "a new focus on black humanity: our science,
technology, culture, politics, religions, individuality, needs, dreams,
hopes, and failings ... [[Mundane Afrofuturism]{.mark} is the ultimate
[laboratory for world-building outside of imperialist, capitalist, white
patriarchy]{.mark}."]{.underline} 43 While Love is the Message expresses
potential solidarity with the oppressed and excluded, both human and
non, Syms's sentiment [[rejects equivalence between racial difference
and the monstrous]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is expressive of what Aria
Dean diagnoses as the [conjunction of black accelerationism and
**Afrofuturism** that entails both a catalytic [movement toward **"the
end of the world"**]{.mark} and a [**revolution** beyond]{.mark} the
in/humanisms of **[racial capitalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 44 In other
words, a younger generation has elected to [**update Afrofuturism**,
asking us to witness a **double** move that rhymes [**negative
critique** with **positive
transformation**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The challenge here is
[[bringing]{.mark} this vision of [social critique]{.mark} and social
liberation [into explicit connection]{.mark} -- [and]{.mark} more
importantly, [direct conflict -- with the neoliberal
Anthropocene]{.mark}, and to [oppose]{.mark} the threat of [white
supremacist tendencies and colonial, extractive
futurism]{.mark}.]{.underline} These [Ecomodernist agendas]{.underline}
are intent on shaping the world to come; with resources and the
political will to do so, it [will not only set us on a track of
unstoppable climate transformation but also interminably extend racial
injustice and white supremacy]{.underline}. 45 Against that scenario,
[[we]{.mark} urgently [need to invent]{.mark} and work toward
cultivating [futures beyond the world's end]{.mark}, where that end is
no longer unthinkable beyond current socio-political and economic
arrangements, or where that end has already in fact
occurred.]{.underline} 46 It is urgent that we ask ourselves, [why
should cultures outside Afrofuturism -- which remain comfortably
shielded by whiteness and the current narratives that uphold its
position -- care? One answer is to reiterate the desirable terms of a
shared world where "injustice anywhere is a threat to justice
everywhere."]{.underline} Expressing a [future-oriented imperative with
new politico-ecological purpose]{.underline}, Fred Moten, in a recent
public conversation with Robin D. G. Kelley, has updated that famous
ethico-political formulation of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (who, it
should be noted, makes a notable appearance in Jafa's video). He posits
the [mission of contemporary Black studies as "on the most fundamental
level to try to [save the earth]{.mark}, and on a secondary level to
[save the possibility of human existence]{.mark}."]{.underline} Kelley
adds that this is a "project for liberation," a "transformative
project," and [if it doesn't [exist as a **response** to]{.mark} "[the
neoliberal]{.mark}, neo-fascist turn, then it's worthless."]{.underline}
47 Why should this project for liberation not also be the overarching
imperative of artistic practice today? If so, then art will name the
practice of creative aesthetics that merges ecological insight with
political engagement in the hopes of not only saving what good we have
but [**securing** a flourishing and **emancipated** future for
all.]{.underline}

[[**2025** marks a **turning point** in world
history]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The [**tectonic** plates of **[i]{.mark}**nternational
**[r]{.mark}**elation[s are shifting]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[the
**globalised**]{.mark} world [economy is being **torn
apart**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} the entire [**capitalist
order** is being **shaken**]{.mark} to its foundations]{.underline} by
political, economic, environmental and social crises.

[[An unstable **new epoch**]{.underline}]{.mark} -- an epoch
[[of]{.mark} war]{.underline}, **[[revolution]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
counter-revolution -- [[has **opened up**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

For over half a century following the Second World War, [**America**
straddled the capitalist world as the sole **imperialist
hegemon**]{.underline}. Now that has changed. [China and Russia have
emerged as **imperialist powers** in their own right]{.underline},
[whereas the [power of US imperialism has shown its
**limits**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[With **Trump**]{.underline} at the helm, [US imperialism is trying to
find a **new footing** on the world stage]{.underline}. But as the first
months of his second term have shown, this is anything but
straightforward.

[[Trump]{.mark} has [slapped]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[tariffs]{.underline}**]{.mark} on friends and foes alike, [sought to
[pull the US out of **Ukraine**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and thrown
**Europe** under the bus]{.underline}]{.mark} in the process.

These dramatic moves reveal something that has been building for a long
time: [as the **capitalist crisis** deepens]{.underline}, and with less
loot to go around, [it's **every man for himself**]{.underline}.

For the ruling class, this is a disaster. [The [strife between the
powers is **unravelling** decades of **globalisation** and free
trade]{.mark}]{.underline}, pouring gasoline on the fire of the economic
crisis.

It has also forced every nation to find the money for ever more guns and
bombs at a time when they are being crushed under historic levels of
debt.

For the majority of the world's population, this means instability,
austerity, and the horrors of war. But, at the same time, [this very
chaos is [a recipe for **class struggle**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[The **workers**]{.underline}]{.mark} of the world [[won't take this

[[Wars ravage **Gaza** and **Ukraine**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[**civil
wars** raged in Sudan and Haiti]{.underline}]{.mark}, each with
tremendous human toll. [[The **environmental crisis** continues]{.mark}
virtually [unabetted]{.mark}]{.underline} by desperately needed
transformations. [Violence and global [warming]{.mark} have [triggered
**massive displacement** and]{.mark}]{.underline} a rise in
**[[immigration]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Trade

**disruption**]{.underline} [to global production]{.underline}]{.mark}
[and value chains]{.underline}. And [[reactionary **political
movements** continue to grow in strength]{.underline}]{.mark}. In this
issue of Perspective on Global Developments and Technology, the Global
Studies Association of North America will [[explore]{.underline}]{.mark}
some of the [[key elements of the **global
upheaval**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

In the first section three articles address the Palestinian struggle for
independence and self-determination. We begin with Dwight Haase and his
article titled, "The Context, Logic, and Perpetuation of Violence."
Haase takes the reader through the daily reality faced by Palestinians;
[inequality]{.underline}, **[dependency]{.underline}**, [political
**repression**]{.underline}, [and ethnic divisions]{.underline}, all of
which [lays the basis for **violence**]{.underline}. He also
interrogates the involvement of the US and its support for Israel, which
has made possible the continuation of the crisis. As he notes, as "long
as the US continues to provide military aid unconditionally, there is
little incentive for the Israeli government" to abandon repression for
peace. Next, we have Gerald Sussman and his essay on the "Nakba and the
US-Israel Imperial Regime." As the author takes us through the history
of Palestinian dispossession he writes, "Modern day [Zionism is a
**retrograde** form of colonialism and imperialism]{.underline} that is
[rooted in 19th century **nationalist**]{.underline},
[militarist]{.underline}, **[capital-expansionist]{.underline}**, [and
**racist** practices]{.underline} and outlooks of Western Europe from
which it sprung." Additionally, Sussman offers the reader an analysis of
mainstream media in both the US and UK, the influence of the Zionist
lobby in US politics, as well as the current situation in the Gaza
invasion. Our last contribution is by a trio of Palestinian authors:
Oqab Jabali, Hanadi Dwikat and Munther Saeedi. Their work is titled,
"Military Naming Practices of Palestinian Factions in Reactive Response
to Israeli Incursions and Aggressions." They explore the practices of
various Palestinian political factions in the naming of their military
operations, and their impact and framing of the conflict. The article
investigates how naming holds deep symbolic, cultural, and emotional
significance. How it helps to recruit fighters and gain public support
for their efforts. This helps to uncover the complex interplay between
[Palestinian **[resistance]{.mark}**]{.underline} and Israel's military
operations.

The next section examines the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. The first
article by Jerry Harris is "Marxism and Ukraine's Struggle for
Independence and Self-Determination." Harris
[[explores]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**historic development** of
socialist thought on]{.mark} the issue of national
**[self-determination]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This [starts with the work
of **Marx** on **Ireland**]{.underline}, **[Lenin's]{.underline}**
approach to the formation [of the **Soviet** Union]{.underline} and its
prison house of nations, [**Ho Chi Minh's** work in the
**Comintern**]{.underline}, **[Chou En-Lai]{.underline}** [at the
**Bundang**]{.underline} conference, [and]{.underline} finally
[**Mao's** understanding of]{.underline} primary and secondary
[contradictions]{.underline} in reference to the Communist Party's
united front with the Kuomintang during the Japanese invasion of China.
The essay then applies these lessons to the current war in Ukraine,
criticizing the "left realist" argument, which characterizes the
conflict as a "proxy war." Next is Madalla Awad Alibeli on "The
Ukrainian Crisis: A Game-Theoretic Analysis of the Complex Interplay
between Ukraine, Russia, and the West." Alibeli examines the conflict
using game theory. This allows him to analyze motivations, constraints,
cooperation and risk-taking within the context of power imbalances,
alliances, and historic ties. The aim is to create a roadmap towards a
diplomatic resolution of the war.

The last section of the journal is titled "Global Challenges and
Strategies for Change," and address a number of key elements in the
global crisis. We start with George Liodakis as he explores the
"Implications of Contemporary Totalitarian Imperialism for the Communist
Perspective." Liodakis examines the [[new characteristics of **global
capitalism**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[particularly the divide between
**Western imperialism** and]{.mark} the rising bloc of **[BRIC]{.mark}**
countrie**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Brazil, Russia, India, and China).
He [[argues]{.mark} that [a multi-polar world is a
**progressive**]{.mark} historic [development]{.mark}]{.underline}, but
that [[**class struggles** should be prioritized]{.mark}
against]{.underline} those **[contradictions]{.underline}** between
nations or blocs of nations. The next article is by Tymoteusz Chaidas on
"China's Connectivity Politics vis-à-vis Global Challenges: A Roadmap to
Strategic Development." The article examines one of the most important
recent transnational developments, China's Belt and Road Initiative.
Chaidas is interested in how China uses the BRI as a means of strategic
connectivity to develop global influence. He compares this to Western
approaches, evaluating the strength and weakness of both developmental
models seeking a sustainable and equitable balance. Claudia Favarato and
Marek Hrubec provide us with an essay titled "Uproar against Liberal
Majoritarianism: Critiques from African Perspectives." The authors delve
deeply into sub-Saharan African political culture. They criticize the
Western bias for liberal majoritarian systems of rule with a focus on
Guinea-Bissau. Instead, they conclude from a range of empirical
investigations and theoretical concerns that more suitable collective
forms of cultural, social, and political traditions are best suited for
African reality. Lastly, Carl Davidson offers the reader both a
philosophical and practical exploration of media, communication, and
consciousness in a worked titled, "The Problem of 'Siloed Media Blocs':
How Modes of Communication Shape Our Organizing." Davidson begins with a
discussion of consciousness and class consciousness, with a review of
Karl Marx, George Herbert Mead, Antonia Gramsci and Alvin and Heidi
Toffler. From there he proceeds to the problem of conspiracy theories,
'fake news' and the expansive field of numerous media silos. He
concludes with a practical discussion of how to overcome the
mystifications of reality, alongside a review of reality based left news
sources and analysis.

#### Socialist movements are [working now]{.underline}\-\--[Mamdani's]{.underline} victory [proves]{.underline}. 

**Robin '25** \[Corey Robin, 7/15/25, writer for Jacobin and PhD in
political science from Yale University, "The Socialist Movement Led
Zohran Mamdani to Victory,"
https://jacobin.com/2025/07/dsa-socialist-movement-mamdani-nyc accessed
7/16/25\] // mrucka

The two best analyses of Zohran Mamdani's recent victory are this one,
by Michael Thomas Carter, and this conversation that Daniel Denvir, the
Terry Gross of the Left, hosted with two organizers in New York City.
Both analyses focus on the elephant in the room.

Virtually all of the commentariat has emphasized Mamdani's videos, his
undeniable charisma and political fluency, and Andrew Cuomo's
weaknesses. The latter were oddly invisible to most commentators up
until the very night that Cuomo conceded; then it became obvious that he
was a weak candidate and was always going to lose. There's a lesson
there about power, which people always treat as static, when it's not.

But easily [[the **most important** factor in Zohran's victory is the
**movement** that]{.mark} Democratic Socialists of America (**[DSA) has
built]{.mark}** in]{.underline} [N]{.underline}ew [Y]{.underline}ork
[C]{.underline}ity [since the Bernie Sanders campaign in
2016.]{.underline} Carter and the two organizers Denvir talks to ---
Gustavo Gordillo and Grace Mauser --- provide both historical
perspective and immediate nuts and bolts commentary. Make sure you read
and listen to them.

I want to stress two elements in what I heard.

First, [[DSA has seen]{.mark} a lot of [failures along the
way.]{.mark}]{.underline} Failure is always a hard thing for social
movements to deal with, particularly in the United States, where failure
is the ultimate sin. But as Eve Weinbaum pointed out years ago in her
excellent book *To Move a Mountain*, which I highly recommend, [every
movement meets failure]{.underline}. [The only question is how it deals
with failure]{.underline}, and Weinbaum has a rich and reflective
analysis of just that question. [DSA [has **figured out**]{.mark} not
only [how to **deal with failure** but also how to **grow from
it**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[We saw the **fruits of its labor** on
**election night**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Second, yesterday, my wife and I went to a massive outdoor DSA party
celebrating Zohran's victory. What struck me most about [the
**[celebration]{.mark}**]{.underline} was that it [[showed how much
**DSA has built a movement culture**.]{.underline}]{.mark} [You could
see it in the way everyone was talking to everyone.]{.underline}
[Usually, at most New York gatherings, everyone is looking over each
other's shoulders to see who is not talking to them, whom they want to
be talking to but can't, who is more important than the person in front
of them.]{.underline} [Here]{.underline}, as I said, [[I saw everyone
talking to everyone]{.mark}, **[wanting to reach out]{.mark}** to each
other, to the person next to them, to bring people into the
conversation.]{.underline} [[There were all kinds of **sign-ups**
everywhere]{.mark}:]{.underline} runners for DSA, trans people for DSA,
parents for DSA, city workers for DSA, and so on. [The
[diversity]{.mark}]{.underline}, in terms of race and age, [[was
i**mpressive**]{.underline}]{.mark}. This was a group of people ---
many, many hundreds, way out in Queens --- that wanted to be with each
other and wanted more people to be with them.

In his unpublished *Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts*, Karl
[[Marx]{.mark} actually [made a point of this **exact moment** in the
development of the workers' movement in France]{.mark}]{.underline},
which he witnessed firsthand while in Paris. [[The moment when
the]{.mark} immediate and more [instrumental **political needs** of
collective action take off into **something more
generative**]{.mark}**:**]{.underline}

[When communist workmen gather together,]{.underline}
[their]{.underline} immediate [aim is instruction]{.underline},
propaganda, etc. [But at the same time they acquire a new need --- the
need for society --- and what appears as a means becomes an
end.]{.underline} This practical development can be most strikingly
observed in the gatherings of French socialist workers. Smoking, eating
and drinking, etc., are no longer means of creating links between
people. [Company, association, conversation, which in its turn has
society as its goal, is enough for them.]{.underline}

[There's]{.underline} always [a danger]{.underline}, of course, [in any
movement, that that [need for company and association becomes
narrow]{.mark} and clique-ish.]{.underline} [[But when **movements are
on the rise**]{.mark}, when they're **robust**, [they tend to be **just
the opposite**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [**[That's what I saw]{.mark}
yesterday**.]{.underline} And hope to see more of in the future.

#### [Socialist futures]{.underline} are [possible]{.underline} now.

[[**Unable** to shake **key issues** like inequality]{.mark},
[capitalist societies face **cries for change**]{.mark}, structural
challenges and technology enabled freedoms.]{.underline} Together
[[these]{.mark} re-write the rules and [propose a more]{.mark}
participative, [**collaborative landscape** of all working
together.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Capitalism is **under siege** from]{.mark} the likes of [a **sharing
economy**]{.mark}]{.underline}, a connected world, a slowdown in the
take up of democracy, and [[intractable problems]{.mark} such as
**[inequality]{.mark}** and [**climate** change]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[Many [believe capitalism contributed to the **global crisis**]{.mark},
[while providing **no solution**]{.mark}, [and desire to see a **fairer
system**]{.mark} take its place.]{.underline}

It is **[[inequality]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [[is at the heart
of]{.mark} this [backlash]{.mark}]{.underline}. President
[Obama]{.underline} [calls income inequality the "defining challenge of
our times",]{.underline} [Pope Francis says "inequality is the roots of
social ills"]{.underline} and in the order of 80% of Britons today now
think the income gap is too large. Thomas Piketty, author of *Capital in
the Twenty-First Century*, is convinced that [rising inequality is [a
nut that will **never be cracked by capitalism**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
His particular emphasis is on wealth inequality. [Wealth inequality in
Europe and the US is roughly twice that of income]{.underline} -- the
top 10% possess between 60% and 70% of wealth but only 25% to 35% of
income and that the western growth in equality in the 60 years or so
that preceded the 1970s is a one-off, and this is very unlikely to occur
again. So, [with no resolution for inequality in sight, Piketty's dark
[prediction is **social unrest**]{.mark} -- lots of it.]{.underline} As
such, tackling wealth inequality makes good economic sense; Wilkinson
and Pickett say that economies with greater inequality suffer adverse
consequences in areas like health, violence, drug addiction and
lifespan.

[[**Evidence** for a **shift** towards]{.underline}]{.mark} more
egalitarian societies, or perhaps, [[social democracies is political
news]{.underline}]{.mark} -- [**Justin [Trudeau]{.mark}** in office in
Canada]{.underline}, [hopefuls **[Bernie Sanders]{.mark}** in the US
[and]{.mark} **Jeremy [Corbyn]{.mark}** in the UK]{.underline} -- **[all
high profile cases]{.underline}** in point. [That they [are enjoying the
limelight]{.mark} is [**testament** to the **strength of the questions**
being asked of **capitalism**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Coming at the issue from another direction is economic and social
theorist, Jeremy Rifkin, who focuses instead on near-zero marginal cost,
the by-product of a connected, sharing world. '[[A g**rowing
legion**]{.mark} of prosumers [is producing and **sharing
information**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} not only
[knowledge]{.underline}, news and entertainment, but also [renewable
energy]{.underline}, 3D printed [[products]{.underline}]{.mark} and
online [college courses]{.underline} [at near-zero marginal cost on the
**collaborative commons**]{.underline}. They are even sharing
[cars]{.underline}, [homes]{.underline}, [clothes]{.underline} and
[tools]{.underline}, [[entirely **bypassing** the]{.mark} **conventional
[capitalist market]{.mark}**.]{.underline}' In effect, [[we're seeing
what looks like **capitalism doing itself out of a
job**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

of a growing number of]{.mark} radicalised [workers]{.mark} and
youth.]{.underline}

1914, 1945, 1989, 2008, and now the year [2025]{.underline}: these are
years that [will be remembered as marking 'before and after' moments in
the history of capitalism.]{.underline} [As [the system has **reached a
dead end**]{.mark}, [the world is **lurching towards** trade **wars**,
remilitarization, war **and crisis**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[The mood among the ruling class is]{.mark} everywhere one of the
**[bleak]{.mark}est pessimism.**]{.underline} [[They **despair**]{.mark}
not only because they are **economically bankrupt**, but [because they
are **politically bankrupt**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Their regime, [their
parties,]{.mark} [are **increasingly hated by
millions**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Bourgeois democracy]{.mark} itself
[is]{.mark} increasingly [in **crisis**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Many so-called ['[lefts']{.mark} throw their hands up in despair because
much of the anger building in the working class has been temporarily
captured and expressed by right-wing demagogues.]{.underline} [They
[despair about a '**rightward shift'** among the **working
class**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [**[There is no such
thing]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [The resurgence of what is called the 'far
right' is itself a distorted expression of enormous anger bubbling away
in society]{.underline} -- a distorted expression that is only possible
because the so-called 'lefts' themselves have woefully failed to give it
a voice.

But there is another side to the equation: [[millions]{.mark} more [have
**turned their backs** on]{.mark} all of the parties of [the ruling
class]{.mark}, and [there is a **yearning**]{.mark} among a growing
layer of youth [for a **real, revolutionary
alternative**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[In country after
country]{.mark},]{.underline} where the RCI signed up hundreds of new
prospective members on 1 May, [the reports below bear this
out.]{.underline}

In the period to come, we can expect violent shifts of the political
pendulum to the right and to the left. The [[communists are]{.mark}
patiently yet energetically [doing the work]{.mark} now to bring
together, [to **organize**]{.mark}**, to train [and educate]{.mark}**
this layer that is already seeking out revolutionary communism, so that
in the future we can give a real leadership to the working class and a
genuine expression to the anger that it feels.]{.underline}

At the congress this weekend of the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP),
the British section of the RCI, political secretary of the RCP, Rob
Sewell, quoted the very interesting words of a strategist of British
capitalism who in a 2020 editorial of the *Financial Times* said the
following:

"[Since the global financial crisis, this sense of betrayal has fueled a
political backlash against globalization and the institutions of liberal
democracy.]{.underline} [Rightwing populism]{.underline} may thrive on
this backlash while leaving capitalist markets in place. But as it
[cannot deliver on its promises to the economically frustrated, it is
just a matter of time before the pitchforks come out for capitalism
itself, and for the wealth of those who benefit from it."]{.underline}

The more astute strategists of capital can clearly see what we can see:
[beneath the surface, [events are preparing an a]{.mark}lmighty [**swing
to the left**.]{.mark}]{.underline} ["[It is **just a matter of time**
before the **pitchforks come out for capitalism**
]{.mark}**itself**."]{.underline} We agree, and we are preparing for
that by organizing the forces of communism now.

Trump The End Of Democracy?,"

[Trump's inauguration was like the coronation of a king.]{.underline} In
his speech, he said he was "saved by God to make America great again."
[The world's richest man]{.underline}, Elon Musk, [flashed a Nazi
salute.]{.underline} A who's who of [billionaires]{.underline}, judges,
and politicians [clapped as Trump signed bigoted and
unconstitutional executive orders]{.underline} to fundamentally reshape
the federal government and concentrate his own power, while targeting
immigrants and transgender people. Then he threw his pen into a
screaming crowd.

Millions of people are probably wondering: is this the end of democracy
in the U.S.? The answer isn't entirely clear. [[Trump's]{.mark}
authoritarian [approach is a]{.mark}n **acute [threat]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} basic democratic rights, and potentially even
[[American **capitalist democracy**]{.underline}]{.mark} itself. He has
threatened to jail his political opponents. If an escalating trade war
causes a new recession, [it's not hard to see Trump attacking striking
workers]{.underline}, like the threats he's already made to jail and
deport student protestors. More profound events like war could serve as
a pretext for a more developed authoritarian regime in the United
States.

But [[it's]{.underline}]{.mark} also [quite [possible that Trump will go
too far and **provoke backlash**]{.mark}]{.underline} from sections of
the ruling class, using the tried and true methods of the financial
markets, who grow tired of watching him tank the economy and shred up
imperialist alliances. [We are on the **cusp** of witnessing **major
divisions** within the U.S. ruling class]{.underline} about the way
forward to save their system while maintaining U.S. imperialism's
dominance over China and the rest of the world. 

Meanwhile, [[workers]{.mark} and young people [are **fighting
back**]{.mark} to defend their democratic rights, which were won through
mass struggle.]{.underline} [[There has]{.mark} even [been
**outrage**]{.mark} expressed at Republican town halls across the
country, [and]{.mark} the "50501 movement" [protests have **spread
quickly**]{.mark}]{.underline}, often organized by individuals with no
experience with activism. [[**Socialists support** these
protests]{.mark} because attacks on democratic rights are **attacks on
working-class people**.]{.underline} At the same time, we think that
[the capitalist form of democracy only serves those in power and **needs
to be replaced**]{.underline} with genuine working-class democracy, or
socialism.

[The next step is to **take on Trump and the billionaire class** at the
same time]{.underline}, something the corporate Democratic Party will
never do. Even if a section of the ruling class removed Trump---which
they will only do under mass pressure from the working class---Trumpism
and the far right wouldn't just go away, and could morph into
something even more extreme and dangerous. 

Right populism is rising around the world, with some parties with active
fascist wings making gains. And whatever pro-corporate politician the
ruling class installed in Trump's place would continue much of Trump and
the ruling class's shared reactionary agenda of making the working class
pay for capitalism's crises and ramping up their conflict with Chinese
imperialism. This is why the fight to bring down Trump and end Trumpism
once and for all is directly connected to the fight against capitalism
itself.

A Strongman To Save U.S. Capitalism

Up until now, Trump's strongman approach won broad ruling-class backing
because U.S. capitalism is facing new challenges in a new period, with a
severe crisis of legitimacy that has only worsened since the 2008
financial collapse. In 1964, 77% of Americans believed the government
did the right thing "most of the time" --- today only 21% do.

Part of the ruling class's hope is that Trump's strongman-style
populism---based on scapegoating minorities to keep workers divided,
threatening to jail protesters, and jumping over partisan gridlock in
Congress---will help their system's crisis of legitimacy by getting
things done, or at the very least distract from it. It appears they were
even willing to risk Trump establishing a more imperial presidency and
weakening other branches of government, in part because the ruling class
wants to push through major changes before it triggers mass struggle
from an angry working class, who have nothing to gain from what Trump is
doing.

The ruling class's other key problem is Chinese imperialism, which
threatens to overtake U.S. imperialism in the struggle for global
domination. Trump wants to focus the U.S. military and economy on
preventing China from eclipsing the U.S. in its economic, military, and
global reach, calling for the weaponization of space and raising \$500
billion to make America "the capital of AI," which will mostly go to the
military. He sees Ukraine as a sideshow, resulting in highly public
breaks with the previous NATO-centered imperialist strategy, like when
Trump yelled at Ukrainian president Zelenskyy in the Oval Office. 

Trump is unapologetic about fighting for the naked interests of US
imperialism. His strong talk about invading Panama to secure control of
the Panama Canal amounted to BlackRock buying out a Chinese port company
that was already hemorrhaging money. He still wants to buy Greenland and
has threatened to invade Canada. His mineral deal in Ukraine is about
processing toxic and radioactive rare earth metals away from US
citizens. He mused about using ethnic cleansing to develop Gaza into the
Riviera of the Middle East. Some of these things will definitely not
happen but the change in approach is very real. He renamed the Alaskan
mountain Denali to Mt. McKinley---after a former president from the
Gilded Age when naked corporate corruption, raw land grabs, and U.S.
imperialist expansion were the norm. 

Trump is trying to reshape the government to fit the new requirements of
U.S. imperialism, including replacing sections of the federal workforce
with disciplined and loyal ideologies regardless of competency. He's
undermining or abandoning the old institutions of imperialism like the
World Health Organization, World Trade Organization, United Nations and
NATO, most visible with his abrupt shift on the war in Ukraine. He is
targeting 10% of the federal workforce, as well as centers of "soft"
imperialist power like USAID and the State Department.

Finally, Trump wants to whip up nationalism among the U.S. population.
The right wing needs to cover up the brutal truth about American
capitalism, which is why he attacks school curriculums that tell the
truth about slavery. His replacement of "Diversity, Equity and
Inclusion" programs with "Merit, Excellence and Intelligence" is an
effort to re-establish the underlying values of capitalism in its early
days, while at the same time rolling back the gains won by working
people and the oppressed. His scapegoating of immigrants---including
making English the official language---and trans people is meant to keep
workers distracted from the country's disgusting levels of wealth
inequality.

While the billionaires see dollar signs in the chaos, they do not have
control over the situation. After all, Trump is in it for himself. When
he lost the vote in 2020 and the political establishment abandoned
him, Trump tried to stage a coup to overturn the outcome. Now since
coming back to office, he has pardoned literally all those who
participated in January 6, 2021. During the George Floyd uprising, Trump
said, "I need the kind of generals Hitler had." He fired the prosecutors
who charged him with fraud. More recently, when federal judges, some he
himself appointed, stood in the way of his agenda, Trump quoted
Napoleon: "He who saves his country breaks no law."

Class Struggle Defines Democracy

While Marxists have long pointed out that "a democratic republic is the
best possible political shell for capitalism," this does not mean the
capitalists need democracy for their system to work. Democracy is useful
to the extent that it gives their system a popular mandate by offering
voters a choice of two similar political parties through elections. This
allows the capitalists a relatively stable way to change policy while
still maintaining control over their system. Even today, defenders of
capitalism like *The Economist *are forced to admit that only one in
twenty people worldwide live in a "full democracy."

Indeed, early capitalism often developed under the repressive conditions
of autocracy. While absolute monarchy was something capitalism needed to
overcome to fully mature, in its current period of protracted crisis,
the arc of history does not bend forever and always towards more
democracy. In fact it now points firmly in the other direction.

[**Working-class** and oppressed people have had to **struggle for every
reform** that expanded democratic rights or improved living
conditions.]{.underline} [The ruling class always stood in the
way]{.underline}---terrorizing Black people who challenged Jim Crow,
force-feeding women on hunger strike over the right to vote,
and shooting workers who went on strike. They only made concessions to
contain the movement from spreading and maintain control. This is how
union rights were won under an aristocrat like FDR, civil rights under
warmonger Lyndon Johnson, and abortion rights under a right-wing hack
like Nixon.

Events like the Russian Revolution of 1917 played a profound role in
shaping capitalist democracy over the next few decades. The capitalists
watched helplessly as Czar Nicholas II was overthrown and replaced with
a workers' democracy, which they then did everything they could to
overthrow. Workers, women, national minorities, and LGBTQ people won
gains after the revolution that were unprecedented in the capitalist,
"democratic" West before a number of these were reversed under
Stalinism. Capitalist politicians in the West responded by granting
limited reforms to avoid revolution in their own countries.

[Even after Stalin took power and crushed workers'
democracy,]{.underline} [the existence of a non-capitalist society
continued to threaten the capitalists and inspire working-class and
oppressed people.]{.underline} Still, [[capitalist politicians **always
tried to**]{.mark} **claw back** their concessions and [**suppress
movements**,]{.mark} [but **backed away** under **threat** of
**working-class action**]{.mark}.]{.underline} 

For example, Richard Nixon had authoritarian methods. He used the power
of the state to spy on his political opponents, unleashed the FBI
to kill and arrest the Black Panthers, and then fired the prosecutors
who pressed charges against him. Nixon got caught, and was forced to
resign over the Watergate scandal during a period when the U.S. ruling
class was still reeling from over a decade of powerful mass
movements. Union density was four times higher than today. It was also
the height of the Cold War. This is why Congress impeached him: it was
better to show that democracy "worked" than risk popular rebellion.

As the Soviet Union stagnated and eventually collapsed, the ruling class
took the offensive. In the U.S., Jimmy Carter deregulated the airlines
and financial markets. Reagan cut taxes on the rich and razed unions.
Clinton carried out historic cuts to welfare. George W. Bush made U.S.
imperialism more interventionist, but when he tried to invest part of
Social Security in the stock market, he faced massive backlash. Obama
bailed out Wall Street and maximized fossil fuel extraction while the
working class was devastated by climate change and the 2008 financial
crisis.

A similar pattern took place around the world. As the threat of
revolution waned, the U.S. aggressively promoted "democracy" and "free"
markets. Neoliberal democracy was anchored by individualism and
meritocracy, and common struggle receded.

The Rise Of Trumpism & The Fade Of Democracy

[The 2008 financial collapse profoundly discredited capitalism and the
political establishment.]{.underline} [A wave of global rebellion was
kicked off by the revolutions in the Middle East and North Africa which
toppled dictators in early 2011.]{.underline} [Hundreds of thousands of
workers and students in Wisconsin occupied the state capital to stop
attacks on unions.]{.underline}

That summer, there were mass occupations and strikes in Southern
Europe against austerity, which inspired Occupy Wall Street to ignite
class consciousness in the U.S. like wildfire. [Capitalist classes
everywhere were horrified by mass rebellions like what followed the
murder of George Floyd, where the burning of the third police precinct
in Minneapolis was supported by a majority of the U.S.
population.]{.underline}

In its decay and decline, the ruling class can't tolerate a world where
powerful CEOs are brought down by allegations of sexual assault, oil
pipelines are blocked by indigenous people, and unions go on strike
and shut down the auto sector. They can't have Democratic politicians
promising to "abolish the police" simply because a mass movement demands
reform. They prefer Trump and did everything they could to sabotage
social democratic reformers like Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn, who
called for working class unity against the billionaires. To a section of
the ruling class, liberal democracy has become more of an obstacle than
the useful tool it once was.

Back in office, [[Trump has triggered events that can easily **spiral
out of control**]{.mark},]{.underline} especially as he inspires
other right-wing nationalist forces, like the far right AfD in Germany,
to act like him. There are more wars involving major countries today
than at any point since WWII. Over the last few years, [[capitalism has
faced **unprecedented crises**]{.mark} of **climate change**,
**migration**, and **pandemics**.]{.underline} It's not difficult to
imagine that [the [next major economic crisis will lead to a **full
scale crisis of the system**]{.mark} like the 1930s,]{.underline} with
the further collapse of global cooperation among major capitalist
countries. 

Defend Democratic Rights -- Fight The Billionaires

Trump is far from the first U.S. president to have authoritarian
ambitions. What makes him so dangerous is that he's come to power at a
moment when the ruling classes are engaged in a massive militarist
buildup on a global scale, and when the forces of the organized working
class are still weak compared to the past.

[[**Only the working class** can build a movement strong enough to
**force Trump to back down**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Globally, **mass
protests**]{.mark}, occupations, civil disobedience and strikes have
stopped coups---as in South Korea recently---and **[brought down
outright dictatorships]{.mark}.**]{.underline} In fact, [[during Trump's
first term]{.mark}, **[mass protests]{.mark}** and airport
occupations [stopped his Muslim Ban]{.mark}, [and the **threat of
general strikes** ended his government shutdown]{.mark} over border wall
funding]{.underline}. Likewise, [[a **breakthrough**]{.mark} here or in
another country [can have a **ripple effect** in the fight against right
populism]{.mark} around the world.]{.underline}

Federal workers who are protesting Trump and Musk were pointing in the
right direction when they carried signs with slogans like "immigrants
didn't take *my job,*" by linking attacks on jobs to scapegoating
immigrants. [[**Working-class struggle** can]{.mark} naturally [bring
out **solidarity**]{.mark} against a ruthless opponent.]{.underline}
[The next step is to put forward a program to **fight for the interests
of the whole working class**, and to directly challenge corporate
politicians like Trump and MAGA billionaires like Elon
Musk.]{.underline}

We need to link all these struggles into a mass day of action on May 1,
International Workers' Day, which was also the day when immigrants
organized a successful one-day mass national strike in 2006 to stop
threats of deportations. While union density is still relatively weak,
unions still represent millions of workers, and [[there has been a
**revival of strike action** in recent years]{.mark}.]{.underline}
However, rank-and-file workers will need to organize to put pressure on
the conservative union leaders who have based their careers on *working
with* rather than *standing up* to the boss.

When Trump's plans to privatize the U.S. Postal Service were leaked,
rank-and-file workers with Build a Fighting NALC (BFN) called for
national protests on March 23. Then they forced their conservative union
leaders in the National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC) to support
it. Now the much wider Federal Unionist Network has signed on. The next
step is to link up with others facing attacks from Trump and Musk, like
trans people, immigrants, environmental groups, etc. It's worth pointing
out that some of the most energetic builders of these actions voted for
Trump, and now recognize it was a mistake.

[It's]{.underline} also [necessary for the movement to build its own
working-class party that can put forward a coherent alternative to
Trump's divisive corporate politics.]{.underline} The Democrats are not
such a force. They are a capitalist party funded by and accountable to
the billionaires. They themselves admit they have "no coherent message"
to defeat Trump. The party leadership blames immigrants and trans people
for their electoral defeat, and has carried out imperialist policies for
over a century. They have no plan to defeat Trumpism, because that would
require alienating what remains of their corporate donors.

Trump 2.0 is both the result of deep changes taking place within global
capitalism, and his reelection has caused these changes to speed up even
further. [**[Working-class people can defeat Trump]{.mark}**, but to
eliminate the basis for future authoritarians like him, we need to
**eliminate capitalism once and for all**]{.underline}. [Real and
lasting democracy can only happen on the basis of socialist society,
where billionaires don't exist.]{.underline}

#### Ongoing [collapse]{.underline} of capitalism's [legitimacy]{.underline} makes [revolution possible]{.underline}.

[Global [capitalism faces a]{.mark}n **unprecedented
[crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline} of epochal proportions. [It has entered
into a stage of absolute **violent predation**.]{.underline} Its
extermination impulse is now rising to the surface. [[We have entered a
period of **great upheavals** and momentous
changes]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The [historical conjuncture poses]{.mark}
grave dangers but also [**new opportunities for mass struggle** from the
**bottom up**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Our]{.mark} burning [challenge is
to renovate projects of **radical transformation**]{.mark} and
**emancipation**, to build up **counter-hegemonic power from below** ---
our very survival depends on it]{.underline}.

Over its 500-plus year history, capitalism has undergone ongoing waves
of expansion through colonialism and imperialism, great cycles of crises
and restructuring, followed by new waves of expansion. I want to talk
about the nature of the global crisis, potentially more catastrophic
than earlier cycles of crisis. I will present the "big picture" and
naturally this means that I am forced to simplify and generalise.

What kind of a crisis are we facing? The internal dynamics of
capitalism, by its very nature, produces crises. Crises are inevitable.
We can speak about three types of crises. The first are cyclical,
periodic downturns or recessions, which occur about once every ten
years. There were downturns of this nature in the early 1980s, the early
1990s, and at the turn of the century. 

But [[we are facing]{.mark} something much more serious: [a **structural
crisis**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Such structural crises occur about every
40-50 years. I call them restructuring crises because the only way to
resolve them is to restructure how the system is organised and how it
functions. There were structural crises in the 1830s, followed by the
first great depression of the late 1870s into the early 1890s, then the
Great Depression of the 1930s.

The last great crisis of this type took place in the 1970s. In response
to that crisis, emergent transnational capital launched globalisation as
prolonged class warfare from above. A transnational capitalist class, or
TCC, emerged as the hegemonic fraction of capital on a world scale. It
went on the offensive to recover the hegemony of capital and
re-discipline the working and popular classes after the anti-colonial
and Third World liberation struggles and mass rebellions of the 1960s
and '70s. 

Globalisation over the past half century has involved a prolonged wave
of worldwide capitalist expansion. The former Soviet bloc countries,
China and the Third World revolutionary states were reintegrated. We
have arrived at the end of the extensive enlargement of world
capitalism, in the sense that apart from a few pockets there are no
longer countries and peoples that are outside of the system. Every
country has become inserted, often violently, into a new globalised
system of production, finances and services controlled by the TCC and
their political agents in states and transnational institutions. There
have been vast new rounds of primitive accumulation, especially in the
countryside of the former Third World. [Hundreds of millions have been
uprooted, thrown into the global labour market and made available for
exploitation by transnational capital, or simply marginalised as surplus
labour.]{.underline} [The global proletarian now numbers five billion,
the largest class in history.]{.underline} But it faces an all-out siege
by the TCC and its political and military agents.

Throughout all of this there has been an extremely rapid and
unprecedented concentration and centralisation of capital on a world
scale in the form of transnational capital. In 2023, just 17 global
financial conglomerates controlled \$49 trillion in wealth, more than
half the value of the entire global economy. In 2022, the world's
ultra-wealthy, made up of 62 billionaires and million millionaires, had
a combined wealth of more than \$190 trillion --- more than double the
entire global GDP. And this while 80% of humanity, some six billion
people, lived in poverty or just above the poverty line. 

[We have seen an accelerated social polarisation.]{.underline} [[Global
**inequalities** have reached **unprecedented
levels**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The 2018 Oxfam International report on
inequalities reported than [the top 1% controlled more than 50% of the
world's wealth and the top 20%]{.underline} --- [that portion of
humanity than can survive in global capitalism]{.underline} ---
[controlled 95% of the world's wealth]{.underline}, while 80% of
humanity had to make do with just 5% of the world's wealth. Moreover,
there is a rapid precariatisation even among the ranks of that 20%. [We
live in the age of the **global dictatorship of the TCC**.]{.underline}

If capital managed to momentarily resolve the crisis of the 1970s, the
next great structural crisis hit with the Global Financial Crisis of
2008. If we see this crisis as cyclical, it was resolved in the 2010s.
But if we see it as structural, then it has actually been getting worse
and is now spiralling into the third type of crisis --- systemic ---
meaning that the only way we can resolve it is by moving beyond the
system itself, beyond global capitalism. 

Quite simply, [we are [facing the **exhaustion of**]{.mark} global
**capitalism's [capacity for renewal]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [[The
ruling classes are **getting desperate**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [They are
upping the ante with **war**, **fascism** and **genocide**.]{.underline}
[These ruling classes [recognise the **severity** of the
**crisis**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Recall that in 2023 the World Economic
Forum released its report characterising the situation as a polycrisis
of great magnitude. But the WEF is not the only transnational elite
forum to sound the alarm bell. The Trilateral Commission released its
own report, as did other forums and intelligence agencies.

We can identify four dimensions of the crisis. These are not separate
crises that converge; they are distinct moments that form a unity ---
the epochal crisis of capitalist civilisation.

Structural: Overaccumulation and stagnation

The first is structural, a crisis of chronic stagnation.
Overaccumulation is built into capitalism. The overproduction of capital
is the most fundamental contradiction, internal to the system. The
leading transnational corporations and financial conglomerates have
registered record profits at the same time as the rate of profit has
fallen and corporate investment has declined. The TCC has accumulated
obscene amounts of wealth, more than they can possibly spend, much less
reinvest. Global markets are saturated. They cannot absorb the output of
the global economy. 

This surplus accumulated capital with nowhere to go has ballooned since
2008. For example, average profits experienced a 52% rise for the 3-year
period from 2021 to 2023 compared with the preceding three years. As the
rate of profit has fallen, total cash held in reserves of the world's
2000 biggest corporations sharply rose, from \$6.6 trillion in 2010 to
\$14.2 trillion in 2020. As the global economy stagnates, corporations
retain rather than reinvest profits. Since 1980 corporate cash holdings
have ballooned to 10% of GDP in the US, 22% in Western Europe, 34% in
South Korea, and 47% in Japan.

[The ruling groups now face a great challenge]{.underline}: [how to keep
the global economy going and sustain accumulation in the face of
stagnation?]{.underline} [They have turned to financial speculation,
debt-driven growth and the plunder of state finance, but these are
[temporary fixes]{.mark} that are [now **reaching their
limits**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Take the case of financial speculation:
the real global economy of goods and services is a little under \$100
trillion, whereas fictitious capital, which is simply speculative
capital, is calculated in the quadrillions of dollars. [[Another
**financial collapse** is **on the horizon**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Enormous pressures are building up to unload this overaccumulated
surplus, to violently crack open new spaces for profitable investment.

[This leads the system to become ever **more violent**, predatory and
reckless.]{.underline} [A deadly new round of **extractivist
accumulation** around the world is already underway, a new round of
global enclosures, and an intensification of what I refer to
as militarised accumulation and accumulation by repression.]{.underline}
[Expanding systems of **mass surveillance**, **warfare**, **social
control** and repression constitute in themselves strategies of
accumulation. ]{.underline}

We are living in a global war economy. Russia's invasion of Ukraine was
a tragedy for the Russian and Ukrainian peoples, for the world's
peoples. But the invasion was a bonanza for the global
military-industrial complex and for a vast host of corporate actors,
from tech to finance. This is why one defence consultant explained right
after the invasion began, "happy days are here again." This is why, when
Israel launched its genocide against Gaza, a Morgan-Stanley executive
declared, "Gaza fits quite nicely into our portfolio."

[Wars on poor communities, immigrants, refugees, gangs and cartels,
privatised mass incarceration, the construction of material and digital
border walls, gated cities and omniscient surveillance systems --- all
this and more are major sources of **accumulation in the face of
stagnation**, throwing fresh firewood on the embers of a **stagnant
global economy**.]{.underline} Overaccumulation explains as much of the
current worldwide war drive and the escalation of conflicts as do
geopolitical and other considerations. Capital's coercive domination is
becoming deeply embedded in new strategies of militarised accumulation
and accumulation by repression. Genocide becomes enormously profitable
and attractive, as it resolves political and economic problems for the
ruling groups. The limits to expansion must be overcome by technologies
of death and destruction.

Crisis of social reproduction: Capital's extermination impulse

Surplus capital produces its alter-ego, surplus labour. Two billion
people have become surplus humanity. The global proletariat is spread
out into two overlapping categories: those expelled from the circuits of
global capital, made redundant and surplus; and those incorporated into
capital's circuits as precarious labour. The digitally-driven
restructuring now underway will vastly expand the ranks of both
categories. [**Billions of people cannot survive**.]{.underline}
[[Social **disintegration is spreading**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[[Millions face **displacement**]{.mark} by conflict, climate change,
economic collapse and political, ethnic and religious
persecution.]{.underline}

[Whole communities, [whole **countries are
collapsing**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Look at [Haiti]{.underline},
[Sudan]{.underline}, [Congo]{.underline}. Whole portions of countries
--- take the examples of Mexico, Colombia or Ecuador --- are under the
control of rising political and military mafias, gangs, and corrupt
cliques. These are new forms of criminal power that are not apart from
formally constituted state power but an adjunct to it. They rule their
criminal fiefdoms in consort with transnational capital. They violently
open up space for transnational capital in exchange for snatching up a
portion of the pie and distributing crumbs among their networks.

At the deepest structural level, the Gaza option --- extermination ---
is an attempt to resolve the problem of surplus humanity through
genocide. Then there is the Salvadoran option, the new mega-prison
geographies. In 2023, the Salvadoran government opened its "Centre for
the Confinement of Terrorism" to incarcerate 40,000 young men, surplus
youth that must be disposed of, locked out of the economy and society.
They are of no use to global capitalism. Following El Salvador's
example, Brazil, Turkey, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Egypt, the Philippines,
India and other countries have announced plans to build new mega
prisons.

These are the new geographies of containment. Borders become less
physical markers than axes around which intensive control of those
expelled is organised. These borderlands are zones of non-being, zones
of death. The US-Mexico border is one such zone, where 7000 people have
died in recent years, although this is only the bodies that have been
recovered and identified. Thousands more are unaccounted for, or
perished making the treacherous journey from as far away as South
America through Central America and Mexico. The Mediterranean is another
such zone of death. Between 2014-24, more than 24,000 people perished,
although again, this does not take into account thousands, maybe tens of
thousands never identified or who perished making such survival
journeys.

These zones of non-being and death are worldwide. In 2023, Saudi border
guards opened fire without warning or provocation against Ethiopian
migrants trying to enter the Kingdom to join their 750,000 countrymen
and women who serve as migrant workers in that country, leaving several
hundred dead and wounded. Transnational migrant labour is crucial to the
global economy. The ruling groups want to generalise the Gulf States
model, a system of virtual slavery whereby migrants are brought in with
work visas, may not change employment, have no labour, civil, social or
political rights, are often held in households or labour camps under
virtual slave-like conditions, and are deported once their labour is no
longer needed.

In [this brave new world of global capitalism, [a **select few** are let
into the Global Fortress]{.mark} as peons [while the **rest of
humanity** is **locked out**]{.mark} and **abandoned**.]{.underline}
These are the new Late Victorian Holocausts, to borrow the phrase coined
by Mike Davis, who was referring to the period of British colonisation
of India, when the colonisers shipped out all the country's agricultural
resources so that periodic famines would take millions --- tens of
millions --- of Indian lives. For the colonisers these victims were just
human waste. Gaza, Congo, Haiti, the world's borderlands --- these
hellscapes are real-time alarm bells warning that capitalism's
extermination impulse is now being activated to resolve capital's
intractable contradiction between surplus capital and surplus labour.

Finally, regarding the crisis of social reproduction, global capitalism
increasingly turns women proletarians from producers of labour power
required by capital into producers of supernumeraries for which capital
has no use. Women's labour, already devalued when it is unwaged, is
further devalued, and women denigrated, as the function of the household
economy moves from rearing labour for *incorporation *into circuits of
capital to rearing supernumeraries. This ever-greater degradation and
devaluation of women proletarians in times of epochal crisis involve
deep structural processes, which combine with cultural and political
processes to breed pandemics of degradation, misogyny and aggression and
violence against women, aggravating the worldwide crisis in gender
relations.

Political crisis: A general crisis of capitalism's rule

[Global [capitalism faces a **political crisis** of]{.mark} **state
[legitimacy]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} capitalist
**[hegemony]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [The [ruling groups are
**desperate**]{.mark} to **re-establish their hegemony and
legitimacy**.]{.underline} [We are seeing an escalation of **state
violence**, the spread of a neo-fascist far right around the world, and
an expansion of the global police state.]{.underline} Unprecedented
inequalities can only be sustained by extreme violence, militarisation
and repression. [The ruling groups face a **crisis of social control**:
how to maintain a grip on power and prevent uprisings? ]{.underline}

[Consensual mechanisms of social control are breaking down as
authoritarian, dictatorial and neo-fascist systems of political
domination spread.]{.underline} Twenty-first century fascism, in my
view, involves a triangulation of transnational capital with reactionary
and repressive state power and a fascist mobilisation in civil society.
It is a project that seeks to channel mass insecurity and social anxiety
away from their source in a global capitalism in crisis and redirect it
towards the Other, whether other countries, ethnicities, immigrants and
refugees, religious minorities, and so on.

[This generates an **explosive situation** --- tinderboxes that can go
off at a moment's notice]{.underline}. Look at the anti-immigrant riots
that broke out in Britain this past summer. Who was doing the rioting
were poor, unemployed white proletarians. Hyper-nationalism is always a
characteristic of fascism, as are racism, scapegoating and
hyper-masculinisation. Frighteningly, elements among the TCC are now
coming on board the fascist project. Donald Trump and Elon Musk are both
billionaire racists and fascists and, as we saw, Musk --- acting as
shadow US co-president --- has openly endorsed the Alternative for
Germany and other far-right and neo-fascist forces in Europe and around
the world.

The agenda of the TCC is to use the state machinery to consummate the
neoliberal counterrevolution of the past half century, to liberate
capital from any remaining constraints. In the US, a new bloc of capital
is emerging that brings together Silicon Valley with the Pentagon and
Wall Street --- that is, tech, finance and the military industrial
complex, along with the medical-industrial complex and energy.

At the same time, the post-World War II international order is cracking
up. We are experiencing a radical reconfiguration of global geopolitical
alignments to the drumbeat of escalating financial turbulence and
political chaos. Yet the crisis of hegemony in the international order
takes place within a single, integrated global economy. 

[We need to be clear: [emerging global capitalist
pluralism]{.mark}]{.underline} may [[offer **greater**]{.mark}
**manoeuvring [room]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} **popular [struggles around
the world]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but a politically multipolar world
does not mean that emerging poles of global capitalism are any less
exploitative or oppressive than established centres. An anti-imperialism
that supports one centre of global capitalist power over another is an
anti-imperialism of fools.

Ecological holocaust

We face a collapse of the biosphere. Each round of expansion of world
capitalism has been more catastrophic than prior ones for the planetary
ecosystem. Artificial intelligence and the digital revolution now
underway promises to bring about a massive new wave of expansion with a
devastating impact on the biosphere.

Capitalism by its very nature requires perpetual expansion, endless
growth, endless accumulation. Halting expansion, or the call by
environmentalists for degrowth, is not an option for capital. Now the
frontiers of appropriation are closing. They are becoming exhausted. The
infinite process of capital accumulation is running up against the
finite character of the biosphere.

Concluding comments: Options for resistance

This analysis has been sombre. But the more we understand the beast of
global capitalism, the better we are equipped to confront it. An
objective analysis is a crucial part of devising our fightback in these
times of epochal crisis. 

[[A **global revolt** has been underway]{.mark} for some time. **[Unrest
is escalating everywhere]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [[**Mass disaffection**
is **simmering**]{.mark} below the surface.]{.underline} As I mentioned,
[[the **whole world is a tinderbox**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[The ruling
groups **fear mass uprisings**.]{.underline}]{.mark} They have been
preparing for them, expanding the global police state and criminalising
dissent and resistance. In sum, [global capitalism's extermination
impulse will be restrained only to the extent that we
resist]{.underline}. [Never has the slogan, "resist to exist," been more
opportune and appropriate.]{.underline}

The growth of the international working class and the global class
struggle

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} objective [[conditions for]{.mark}
**socialist [revolution]{.mark}** [emerge out of]{.mark} the **[global
crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The approach of social
[revolution]{.mark} has already been [**foreshadowed**
in]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[mass **demonstrations**]{.mark} **and
strikes**]{.underline} that swept across the globe [[in
2019]{.underline}]{.mark}: in [Mexico]{.underline}, Puerto Rico,
Ecuador, [Colombia]{.underline}, Chile, [France]{.underline},
[Spain]{.underline}, [Algeria]{.underline}, [Britain]{.underline},
Lebanon, [Iraq]{.underline}, Iran, Sudan, Kenya, [South
Africa]{.underline}, [India]{.underline} and [Hong Kong]{.underline}.
[The United States, where the entire **political structure** is directed
toward the **suppression of class struggle**, witnessed the **first
national strike** by **auto workers** in more than **forty
years**.]{.underline}

But [[the]{.mark} dominant and [most **revolutionary feature**
of]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[class struggle is]{.mark} its
**[international character]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [rooted in the global
character of modern-day capitalism.]{.underline} Moreover, [[the
movement of the working class is a movement of the **younger
generation**]{.underline}]{.mark} and, therefore, [a movement that [will
**shape the future**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Those under 30 now comprise over half the world's
population]{.underline} and over 65 percent of the population in the
world's fastest growing regions---Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East
and South and Southeast Asia. Each month in India, one million people
turn 18. In the Middle East and North Africa, an estimated 27 million
young people will enter the workforce in the next five years.

From 1980 to 2010, [global [industrial development added **1.2 billion
people** to the]{.mark} ranks of the **[working
class]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} with hundreds of millions more in
the decade since. Of this 1.2 billion, 900 million entered the working
class in the developing world. Internationally, the percentage of the
global labor force that can be classified as peasant declined from 44
percent in 1991 to 28 percent in 2018. Nearly one billion people in
Sub-Saharan Africa are expected to join the working class in the coming
decades. In China alone, 121 million people moved from "farm to factory"
between 2000 and 2010, with millions more in the decade since.

It is not only Asia and Africa that have seen a growth in the working
class population. [[In]{.underline}]{.mark} the [advanced [capitalist
countries]{.mark},]{.underline} [[large sections of]{.mark} those who
would have previously considered themselves [middle class have been
**proletarianized**]{.mark},]{.underline} while the wave of immigrants
from Latin America to the United States and from North Africa and the
Middle East to Europe has added millions to a highly diverse workforce.

From 2010 to 2019, [the world's **urban population** grew by **one
billion**]{.underline}, creating a network of interconnected
"megacities" [that are]{.underline} both [hives of economic productivity
and social powder kegs,]{.underline} [where [**inequality** is a
**visible fact of daily life**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

And [these [workers are **connected**]{.mark} with each other [in a
manner that is **unprecedented in**]{.mark} **world
[history]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [colossal [advances in]{.mark}
science, **[tech]{.mark}nology [and
communications]{.mark},**]{.underline} above all [the rise of the
**internet** and the proliferation of mobile devices,]{.underline}
[[have allowed **masses** of people to **bypass**]{.mark} the **fake
[news of the bourgeois]{.mark}** media]{.underline}, [which function as
little more than mouthpieces for the state and intelligence
agencies.]{.underline} [More than half of the world's
population]{.underline}, 4.4 billion people, [now have access to the
internet.]{.underline} The average individual spends over two hours on
social media each day, largely on handheld devices.

[[Workers]{.mark} and youth [can]{.mark} now [**coordinate** their
protests and actions on a **global scale**]{.mark}]{.underline},
expressed in the [international movement against climate
change]{.underline}, the [emergence of the "yellow vests"]{.underline}
as a worldwide symbol of protest against inequality, and the [solidarity
of auto workers in the United States and Mexico.]{.underline}

[These objective [changes are producing **major shifts** in **social
consciousness**]{.mark} on the central question of **social
inequality**.]{.underline} The 2019 United Nations Human Development
Report explains that [[in almost all countries, the percentage of people
**demanding greater equality** increased]{.mark} from the 2000s to the
2010s [by up to **50 percent**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The report warned:
"[Surveys have revealed rising perceptions of inequality,]{.underline}
[rising preferences for greater equality]{.underline} and rising global
inequality in subjective perceptions of well-being. All these trends
should be bright red-flags."

into]{.mark} **overwhelming [despair]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [The past
decade has made it clear that [**capitalism is in crisis** for all but a
handful]{.mark}.]{.underline} 

As of October 2021, [the wealth of the United States' **745
billionaires**]{.underline}---or the country's top 0.0002%---[increased
by over **70%,**]{.underline} from \$2.9 trillion to an astounding total
of over \$5 trillion, during the COVID-19 pandemic. That [2,750 people
have as much wealth as over one half of the planet]{.underline}, or 3.9
billion people, stands testament to the criminality of this system. [No
amount of "self-care" can overcome the senseless **material
deprivation** and devastation faced by billions of people]{.underline},
[and the **profound anxiety** and alienation that as a result strain our
relation to work]{.underline}, not to mention our relationships at home
and in our communities.

[But [that **does not** mean the current state of society is
**hopeless**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Recent events and
history]{.underline}]{.mark} alike [[prove **that is far from the
case**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [A [better understanding of]{.mark} the
material [causes driving]{.mark} economic, political, and social
[processes]{.mark}]{.underline} over the last decade---as well as over
the last several centuries of capitalism---[[reveals how **we
can**]{.mark} **concretely [fight back]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
[[Millions]{.mark} of working people and youth [have **refused to
resign** to this situation]{.mark}, [and have **fought back**]{.mark}
against **corruption**, **greed**, and climate destruction.]{.underline}
As scientific socialists, we think [that [the **greater organization and
unity** of these forces behind a]{.mark} clear, [socialist program
is]{.mark} not only **[possible]{.mark}**, but **absolutely
necessary**]{.underline} to drive society forward. 

In reply to multiple recessions, racist police brutality, rampant
sexism, climate change, and degraded working conditions, workers and
youth made their mark on the 2010s: Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives
Matter, the #MeToo movement, Fridays for Future, Red For Ed and the
reemergence of mass labor struggles. This list encompasses far more when
taking into account the international struggles that have both inspired
and been inspired by these recent movements in the U.S. [The [**growth**
of social and labor **movements** demonstrate]{.mark} that
[millions]{.mark} of **radicalizing workers and youth** [are ready to
test **new methods** of struggle]{.mark} against]{.underline} their
oppressors and [the capitalist class]{.underline}, with [[more people
identifying as **"anti-capitalist"**]{.underline}]{.mark} and,
increasingly, as socialist. According to a 2021 Axios and Momentive
poll, [**54%** of adults]{.underline} aged 18 to 34 years [said they had
a **negative view** of capitalism]{.underline}, while 51% percent
supported socialism. [Bernie Sanders and the call for a political
revolution]{.underline} against the billionaire class [has influenced
the political views of millions]{.underline} during an incredibly
turbulent era, and **[democratic [socialist
organizations]{.mark}]{.underline}** like DSA and Socialist Alternative
[[have **grown**]{.mark} as a result.]{.underline}

Socialism's re-emergence as a popular political identifier produces
questions and important debates about what socialism actually is. How
can it work, and how will it address inequality, oppression, and climate
change? What is necessary to actually achieve it and overthrow
capitalism? Can we get there by reforming the current system, or do we
need to break entirely from it for the working class to be able to
assert itself? Did socialism "fail" in the Soviet Union, China, and
throughout the developing world? All of these questions deserve much
study and discussion. Right now, one of the most important tasks
Marxists have is to patiently and thoroughly respond to them, and to win
more people to the struggle for socialism.

The socialist movement has deep traditions stemming from the scientific
economic and political theories of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.
Throughout the latter 19th and 20th centuries, Marxist theory and
class-based struggle won numerous victories for workers and the
oppressed, the most groundbreaking of which was the Russian Revolution.
Movements have of course also experienced setbacks. The lessons derived
from this history inform what kind of politics and organization we need
to take on capitalism and win socialism in the twenty-first century. 

#### The Trump administration means that revolution is viable now\-\--capitalism is collapsing. 

Per **Olsson '25**, PhD from Stockholm School of Economics and Dean of
Faculty and Research and the DHL Group Professor in Sustainable
Accounting at ESMT Berlin, 7/11/25, "Trump Heads Towards a Full-Scale
Trade War," https://internationalsocialist.net/2025/07/economy-11/
accessed 7/20/25 // mrucka

[[The Trump administration is becoming **increasingly**]{.mark}
**authoritarian** and **[threatening]{.mark}**]{.underline}---both at
home and on the world stage. At the same time, [[**support** for Trump
is **falling**]{.mark} and his new budget is **unpopular**.]{.underline}
[A [majority believe that it will **make things
worse**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The budget represents a historic
redistribution of wealth from the poor to the already rich.]{.underline}

The [**bottom 20** percent of households would see their annual incomes
**fall** about **\$800**]{.underline} in 2027 on average. Meanwhile the
[**top 20** percent would see theirs **grow by \$9,700**]{.underline} on
average. The top 1 percent would gain \$63,000.

The budget includes \$1.2 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and other social
safety net programs. The proposed cuts represent the largest slashing of
federal healthcare spending ever, and could leave as many as 12 million
Americans without insurance by 2034. This rises to 17 million people if
other cuts and changes are included. The cuts means that over 300
hospitals may be in danger of closing.

The budget is also extremely hostile to the climate. The oil and coal
industries will receive new tax cuts and subsidies, while the opposite
is true for wind and solar power.

Overall, the budget's tax gifts to the rich and large corporations will
mean increased deficits, growing government debt, and interest costs (on
government loans) that will almost double by 2034. This, in turn, will
be followed by even harsher attacks on the living conditions of ordinary
people in the US. But [it is]{.underline} also [likely that the Trump
administration will increasingly **try to starve the rest of the world**
with the help of, among other things, an **escalated trade
war**.]{.underline}

This week, the deadline for the tariff pause that Trump was forced to
take after his tariff package on April 2, the so-called "Liberation Day"
sent the world's stock exchanges and financial markets into turmoil, was
extended to August 1.

According to Trump, April 2 was forever to "be remembered as the day
American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny was reclaimed".
But it was a day that nearly plunged the US and the global economy into
a new crisis. In just two days, the US market lost more than \$6
trillion in value and the US dollar begin to sink, and is still sinking.
This in turn forced Trump to retreat and begin 'negotiations' with all
the countries that were going to be punished by the so-called
'reciprocal' tariffs.

Despite the 'pause', tariffs have both increased and risen since April.
US tariffs are now the highest since 1934. On July 7, the Trump
administration sent letters to 14 countries threatened to reimpose
tariffs on South Korea, Japan, Thailand, Malaysia, and others by August
1 if they didn't strike a trade deal that is favorable to US capitalism.
The anticipated tariff rates varied from 25 percent on Japan and South
Korea to 40 percent on Myanmar.

The 'negotiations' that have taken place since April, and earlier, have
been characterized by mafia diplomacy. With US imperialism's gun to
their heads, the other side has been given 'an offer they can't refuse'.
However, US imperialism has so far only signed agreements with two
countries: the UK and Vietnam. Both of these agreements have in common
that exports to the US will be subject to higher tariffs and that they
are also aimed at China, the US's main rival on the world stage. Other
agreements, if signed, will be in line with these two.

The news site Bloomberg estimates that after the so-called tariff pause
in the spring, average tariffs on all US imports could rise to around 20
percent or more, compared to just under 3 percent before Trump took
office in January.

Socialists are neither for so-called free trade nor tariffs, both of
which are means of exploitation and plunder.

[The [**capitalists** were in favor of]{.mark} so-called '[free
trade]{.mark}' and 'global cooperation' [as long as they believed it
best served them]{.mark} and the system]{.underline}, [[but now it is
**completely different**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [In a time of
**[intensifying competition]{.mark}** in a world **market** that is **no
longer growing**]{.underline}---world trade in goods is declining again
this year---[[and increasing]{.mark} imperialist **[power
struggles]{.mark}**, [it is **every man for
himself**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Nationalism and militarism are in the
driver's seat, as expressed in the **trade war**.]{.underline}

[[The **imminent escalation** of]{.mark} the [trade war will hit
both]{.mark} the [**rivals and allies** of]{.mark} US imperialism and
**[US capitalism]{.mark}**, [which is **no longer
growing**]{.mark}.]{.underline} At the same time, [the value of the
dollar is plummeting]{.underline}, which, together with tariffs, is
pushing inflation upward. The tariffs could cost American families
around \$2,300 this year.

[The [**escalating trade war** is **reinforcing**]{.mark} the
[**contradictions** and accelerating]{.mark} the [development toward a
**new crisis for global capitalism**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which could
be as devastating as the economic depression of the 1930s.

[[Trump 2.0 is]{.mark} symptomatic of [a **capitalist system in
decline**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[**Only a mass movement** led by the
working class]{.mark}---a socialist revolution---[can **halt**
]{.mark}**the [catastrophes]{.mark}** toward which sick capitalism is
leading the world.]{.underline}

[[The situation]{.underline}]{.mark} both appalls and [[brings
**hope**.]{.underline}]{.mark} On one hand, [[there is action of]{.mark}
an [**intensity** not seen since the]{.mark}
**19[70s]{.mark}**.]{.underline} On the other, [working
conditions]{.underline}---which, as teachers like to say, are students'
learning conditions---[have become so dire as to demand a
battle.]{.underline} Around 75 percent of professors in the United
States now work off the tenure track, most for pay that ranges from
narrowly sufficient to blatantly unsustainable. Often, they have little
autonomy in terms of what, how, or when they teach. Most have no
institutional support for research; all are watched obsessively by a
ballooning corps of managers (for the "all-administrative university,"
see Benjamin Ginsberg's 2011 book *The Fall of the Faculty*). In the
meantime, universities devote themselves to landlordism, healthcare
capitalism, private equity, policing, jacked-up tuition, and other forms
of wealth extraction---trying all the while to whitewash the situation
and maintain their progressive public images.

Put another way: Universities' wealth isn't distributed to their
workers. Like other American employees, academics' inflation-adjusted
wages have flatlined since the mid-1970s. Within the institution, pay is
only good for upper management and football coaches. Meanwhile, a
reactionary Supreme Court kills student debt relief for tens of
millions, and the planet continues to boil. What's a professor to do?

Plenty has been written about the neoliberalization of American higher
ed, wherein many US schools resemble grotesque hybrids of corporations,
hedge funds, and sports franchises rather than centers of learning.
Similarly, ample energy has been devoted to the poor treatment of
faculty and staff by powerful administrators. (Marc Bousquet's chilling
2008 study *How the University Works: Higher Education and the Low-Wage
Nation *was published during the Bush administration, after all.) What
happens inside the classroom has also been the subject of immense
scholarship. Current best practices call for centering student agency
over instructor expertise, attending to questions of social justice,
downplaying coldly competitive or evaluative criteria like grades, and
underscoring how writing is situated in sociopolitical contexts.

Receiving less attention are the ways in which pedagogy and classroom
practice are minutely interwoven with the political economy of specific
institutions, higher education acts as an entire financialized sector,
and the United States represents what many scholars have called a
"business civilization." Since Reagan's 1980s, students have been
incentivized to see their education as a private, eminently lucrative
investment in their self---a method of either joining or staying in the
middle or upper classes. Led by budget-slashing administrators, students
are encouraged to view many fields---including, unsurprisingly, most of
those in the arts and humanities---as useless trifles at best and traps
at worst (unless you happen to have family money). They are urged to
join the nominally pragmatic STEM universe, through which universities
develop their marketable technological "breakthroughs"---which can, of
course, be monetized via intellectual property rights.

Capitalism is an existential threat to critical culture. The ideology
infects our education system, inhibiting the free development of human
potential. Once students pick a major, testing and grades are used to
rank and sort. Similar systems are used to pit them against each other
for access to law, business, and medical school. They determine who
receives scholarships that lessen one's debt burden, or plum entry jobs
with Google. And now, generative AI beckons in the form of programs like
ChatGPT. After all, why do the intellectual lifting yourself when all
that matters is the boring terminus, a "useful" degree?

Amid this capitalistic system of education, the question becomes: Can
teachers demonstrate forms of opposition? Can anti-capitalism actually
be taught?

Assistant professor of English and director of writing at Seton Hall
University James Rushing Daniel certainly thinks so. His
thrilling *Toward an Anti-Capitalist Composition* (2022) threads the
pedagogical and the political together. In equal parts polemic,
scholarship, and memoir, Daniel's book contends that a writing-intensive
course can---at the level not just of content but of form---effectively
introduce students to anti-capitalism. Teaching can stage encounters
between the capitalist logic that has overrun the world and the
remaining extant non- or anti-capitalist possibilities for
living---including the university as a public good, controlled by the
people who actually keep it running. Writes Daniel, we need a
"*(re)commoned* university," a "radically egalitarian site most
fundamentally organized and governed by those who maintain it rather
than those who preside over its financial situation."

For Daniel, it is not a question of students swearing their allegiance
to Karl Marx. Teaching anti-capitalism is not about blunt indoctrination
or straightforward information transfer. (This wouldn't work anyway, as
students are critical beings just like their teachers.) No: What Daniel
advocates for instead is an alternative pedagogy---a teaching structure
opposing the capitalistic logic that society should be organized around
profit-seeking, consumption-addled individuality. This form of teaching
offers a socialized approach to interrogating things like debt,
employment, and the digital platforms in which all writing is now
entangled. It designates the writing classroom as a place for people to
think together, in which their "collective labor \[is\] organized as the
critique of capitalism, rather than its fulfillment."

Writes Daniel: "\[A\]nticapitalist action \[is\] a site of vital
togetherness." Of this, he contends, the classroom can be a primary
instance---a site of resistance against the isolating, competitive logic
of capitalism. There, students might work together to build knowledge
and communicative capacity independent of profit, cutthroat anxiety, or
selfish pleasure. Hidden inside the mass of the contemporary
techno-imperial university is something precious and profoundly worth
preserving.

[**[Students know]{.mark}** that [the **world is in
crisis**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[They]{.mark} stare at
**misery-producing screens** and [recognize that the planet is
**cooked** for the benefit of an **obscene
minority**]{.mark}]{.underline}; they lived through a pandemic.
[[Many]{.mark} already [sense that]{.mark}]{.underline}, as Daniel
(following a mass of scholarship) puts it, ["[capitalism]{.mark} plays a
**crucial role** in deepening and [sustain]{.mark}ing **virtually

[[**The feeling is there**.]{.underline}]{.mark} [Students just need a
critical language for it]{.underline}---an anti-capitalist one that
composition classrooms can nourish at the level of both pedagogical form
and thematic content. This need is, in turn, linked to campus labor
struggles and the battle for a democratic university, which is happening
right now in places like Florida (where Governor Ron DeSantis's henchmen
continue to dismantle the state's public schools) and West Virginia, the
site of E. Gordon Gee's wrecking campaign.

### Alternative\-\--Movements Key\-\--2NC

#### The ultra wealthy only benefit from the system of capitalism while they use it against everyone else -- massive movements are key to solve what activists have failed to.

But to win permanent change, [[we]{.underline}]{.mark} will [[need mass
movements]{.mark} on]{.underline} an [even larger scale]{.underline}.
Empson discusses the various proposals for a Green New Deal
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [[massive state intervention]{.mark}
to]{.underline} build [a]{.underline} [sustainable society]{.underline}.
[[If]{.mark} all the [world's resources were put to use]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} immediately [transition to renewable energy,]{.mark} [we
could cut pollution extremely quickly]{.mark}]{.underline}. We could
ensure [sustainable practices]{.underline} in all of our industries, we
could [make energy free and available]{.underline} to everyone. We could
set to [work on repairing the damage]{.underline} already
[done]{.underline}, and [ensure no one is left behind]{.underline}. But
the [[challenge of such proposals]{.underline}]{.mark} to reform
capitalism "[[is getting them implemented]{.underline}]{.mark}", he
writes. [[Activists]{.underline}]{.mark} who advocate getting more
progressive politicians into power or change within the existing system
[[under-estimate]{.mark} [the forces we are up
against]{.mark}.]{.underline} As Empson explains, the power of the state
alongside the [interests of the rich means]{.underline} that, even when
left-wing [[parties]{.underline}]{.mark} get a foothold in parliament,
they [[are unable to implement]{.underline}]{.mark} the wide-reaching
[[reforms]{.mark} that tackl]{.underline}ing [climate
change]{.underline} requires. [[Capitalists]{.underline}]{.mark}, unable
to escape the system's logic of competition and profits, [[will not
allow this]{.underline}]{.mark} to occur [[due to]{.underline}]{.mark}
its [[threat]{.mark} to]{.underline} the [[profits of the massive fossil
fuel companies]{.underline}]{.mark}. The ultra-rich own the bulk of the
[mainstream media]{.underline} and use this to [[promote their
agenda]{.underline}]{.mark}. But they also have [enormous
power]{.underline} thanks to their control over the major corporations
and society's basic economic decisions. In the past they have
[used]{.underline} this [to [force elected governments]{.mark}
to]{.underline} do their bidding through [[threatening to sack thousands
of workers and crash]{.mark}]{.underline} whole national
[[economies]{.underline}]{.mark}. In a worst-case scenario, the [ruling
[class]{.mark} can [use]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[state]{.mark} not
just]{.underline} [[to use violence against protests and]{.mark} social
[movements]{.mark}]{.underline} [but]{.underline} to
[[resort]{.underline} [to]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[military to
overthrow]{.mark} governments]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
parliamentary [[democracy]{.underline}]{.mark} itself. Revolution Empson
therefore argues that in order to stop climate change, it is not enough
to get progressive politicians into power but that the [[capitalist
system]{.underline} as a whole [has to be
overthrown]{.underline}]{.mark}. Empson draws on the history of past
revolutions, such as the Paris Commune of 1871, the Russian Revolution
of 1917 and more recent events like the Egyptian revolution in 2011 and
the revolution in Sudan still ongoing from 2019 to explain how this has
occurred. He explains why the [work[ing class is central to any hope
of]{.mark} revolutionary [social change]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[[Cap]{.mark}italism]{.underline} is a system which
[[protects]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[property]{.mark}
[rights]{.mark}]{.underline} of the bosses. The vast [[majority of
people, who own nothing, must work]{.mark} [for]{.mark}]{.underline}
these [[bosses]{.underline}]{.mark} in order [to live]{.underline}. This
unequal situation means that [[bosses can exploit
workers]{.underline}]{.mark} by only paying them a fraction of what they
earn for the bosses through their work. While this means that the world
is run in the interests of a tiny minority of ultra-rich bosses at the
expense of the vast majority, it also reveals capitalism's Achilles'
heel. [Through taking [strike action and collectively refusing to
work]{.mark}]{.underline}, [workers have the power to [bring capitalism
grinding to halt]{.mark}]{.underline}. Strike action on a large enough
scale [[shows]{.mark} [ordinary working class people their own capacity
to control society]{.mark}]{.underline} and run it for themselves.

### Alternative\-\--Marxism Good\-\--2NC

#### Marxist empiricism is [essential]{.underline} for revolutionary [transition]{.underline}. 

**Novack '25** \[George; July 28; American Marxist theoretician, editor,
and activist; The Militant, "Marxism is key to leading fight from
capitalism to socialism," vol. 89, no. 26\] lucao

The [[**materialist** conception of the world is]{.mark} squarely
[opposed]{.mark}]{.underline} not to empiricism, but [[to
**idealism**]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[[Empiricism]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[is a composite of ideas]{.underline} belonging [to
**[dissimilar]{.mark}**]{.underline} and even [[**incompatible**
viewpoints]{.underline}]{.mark}; it is situated between these polar
types of philosophy. ...

The [[**regularities** of society are]{.underline}]{.mark} primarily
[[expressed in]{.mark} the **[productive activities]{.mark}** and
**economic relations**]{.underline} of its members. Since our species
emerged from the primate stage, men have acquired and produced the means
of satisfying their needs in routine ways through repetitive labor
processes. The tools they made for that purpose were fashioned according
to traditional techniques and previous models.

Our prime source of knowledge about preliterate times comes from
archaeology, that science of society which deals with the earliest human
activities incorporated in artifacts. ...

Jacquetta Hawkes tells us that "in the Lower Paleolithic period the
hand-axe, although it was gradually improved, remained in use as the
dominant tool form for over a quarter of a million years."

The [[**social relations** of]{.mark} the most [**primitive** peoples
were]{.mark}]{.underline} as simple and [[**standardized** as]{.mark}
their [instruments of **production**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The small
bands or tribes of Stone Age food-gatherers, hunters or fishermen, had
collectivist institutions and customs. The [scope of
**[variations]{.mark}** in their social organization were [held
within]{.mark}]{.underline} the narrow [limits [prescribed]{.mark}
by]{.underline} their mode of **[[production]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
They might live in caves or camps but had, as a rule, no permanent
settlements.

The [[**innovation** of food]{.mark} production]{.underline} which gave
rise to barbarism [[introduced]{.mark} the first **epoch-making**
changes and extensive [**diversifications** into]{.mark}]{.underline}
primitive **[[social structures]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But the barbaric
communities and kingdoms were based upon agriculture. What could be more
repetitive than this kind of economy rooted in the natural processes of
plant growth and reproduction, regulated by the round of the seasons,
and carried on by traditional techniques and rituals?

Mankind took more than a million years to go from savagery through
barbarism to civilization. This crawling pace indicates how greatly
recurrences outweighed novelties in daily life. Even after the most
advanced sections of humanity became civilized, the fixity of social
relations and the slow and intermittent rate of change in the
agricultural societies, culminating in feudalism, betokened the
predominance of repetition in the lives and labors of their human
constituents.

[[**Change** becomes the **rule** rather than]{.mark} the
**[exception]{.mark}** in society]{.underline} and history only with the
advent of capitalism --- precisely because of the peculiar nature of its
mode of production. Unlike previous master classes, [[the
**bourgeoisie** is impelled by the **dictates** of]{.mark} its [economic
interests to keep modernizing]{.mark} and revolutionizing]{.underline}
the [conditions of **production**]{.underline}. This is [[imposed by
**competition**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [the necessities of **capital
[accumulation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[the drive
for]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**[max]{.mark}**imization of
**[profits]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Incidentally, that is why the peasant
is "history-less," the proletariat is so historical-minded. ...

However, [[bourgeois changeability has **inherent
limits**]{.underline}]{.mark}. As much as [the
**[capitalist]{.mark}**]{.underline} class may reform the economy and
other parts of society, it [[cannot replace]{.mark} the [mode of
**production**]{.mark} and **appropriation** [upon which its
**property**]{.mark}]{.underline}, profits, [and **power**
[rest]{.mark}]{.underline}. It must safeguard these at all costs. This
conservative basis of its socioeconomic position clashes with the
cumulative changes in the rest of the system. The intensification of
these contradictions in its system has led to grave social and political
crises. ...

The [[main task of]{.underline}]{.mark} historical and **[[social
science]{.underline}]{.mark}**, according to Marxism, [[is to find out
the **pattern** of]{.underline}]{.mark} all [those
**[regularities]{.mark}** and **formulate** them]{.underline} into laws
that express the necessary connections of objective realities in their
evolution. [Such]{.underline} regularities [are not **confined** to
established **social structures**]{.underline}. [They]{.underline} also
[**operate** within]{.underline} the evolutionary and
[[**revolutionary** changes]{.underline}]{.mark} which bring new and
higher types of social organization into existence. These processes
[[begin with]{.mark} **occasional variations** from the customary
[**pattern** which]{.mark} massively [**recur** until they acquire
power]{.mark}]{.underline} enough [to **overthrow**]{.underline} and
replace [the **old order**]{.underline}. ...

Why did the [[**Cuban** Revolution follow a **different**
path]{.underline}]{.mark} and have an outcome different
[[from]{.underline}]{.mark} its [Latin-American
**[predecessors]{.mark}**]{.underline} in Mexico, Bolivia, and
Guatemala? There were numerous reasons for its unprecedented turn. Among
these was the fact that \[Fidel\] [**Castro** and his associates learned
from]{.underline} the military coup in **[Guatemala]{.underline}** in
1954 that, [if **colonialism** was to be **stamped out**]{.underline}
and popular power preserved, the officer corps and [the old army had to
be **destroyed**]{.underline} [and replaced by]{.underline} a
[**revolutionary** armed force]{.underline}.

In addition, [they [learned how to **expropriate**]{.mark} the
[capitalists and]{.mark} start [building a **planned
economy**]{.mark}]{.underline} from Russia, Yugoslavia, and China. The
whole experience of twentieth-century history since 1917, plus the
[**international balance** of forces issuing from it]{.underline}, [were
indispensable **preconditions**]{.underline} for the unanticipated
course taken by the Fidelistas. ...

The [[**policies** of Washington to **contain**]{.underline}]{.mark} and
crush, [[and of Havana to **aid**]{.underline}]{.mark} and extend, the
socialist revolution have a lawful character. [They [**correspond**
to]{.mark} the logic and [**dynamics** of]{.mark} current
[history]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is determined and directed by the
necessities of the mortal combat between capitalism and socialism. ...

\[**[[Only]{.underline}]{.mark}**\] [[Marxism]{.underline}]{.mark},
which stands at the apex of sociological and scientific development,
[[can assure the]{.mark} finding of [satisfactory answers
to]{.mark}]{.underline} the most complex and [[compelling issues
of]{.mark} this age of **[transition]{.mark}** from **capitalism** to
**socialism**]{.underline}.

### Alternative\-\--Socialism\-\--Ext

#### Socialist planning is [both]{.underline} more coherent AND more [effectively decentralized]{.underline} because it can [directly]{.underline} incorporate local knowledge into the [overall]{.underline} plan

3.2. Centralization and decentralization. The [[fundamental]{.mark}
economic [problem]{.mark} facing]{.underline} the organization of [a
complex society (with developed divisions of labor) [is how to allocate
resources]{.mark} and coordinate activities
**[efficiently]{.mark}**]{.underline} (which requires being able [to
make rational cost calculations]{.underline}) in order [to effectively
meet the population's needs and consumption preferences]{.underline}.5
[**[In]{.mark} the [capitalist]{.mark} mode** of
[production]{.mark}]{.underline}, both economic [coordination and
[calculation]{.mark} of costs [are **spontaneously established**
by]{.mark}]{.underline} means of [**the [market]{.mark}**, based
on]{.underline} the [particular initiatives of private owners of
resources, who individually decide what, where, how, and how much will
be produced and invested, **always [according to profit
expectations]{.mark}**[. This is]{.mark} a highly **[atomized]{.mark}**
decision-making process [marked by **opacity**]{.mark} **and
[uncertainty]{.mark}**, from which are derived blind operation of
activities and a non-conscious form of regulation.
**[Socialism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, on the other hand,
**[[presupposes]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [**[abolition of private
ownership]{.mark}** of the means of production and the]{.underline}
(tendency toward) [integration of production into a general economic
plan]{.underline}. Thus [the [obvious question]{.mark}]{.underline} to
be posed in such a framework [is: **[who will make]{.mark} the myriad
[productive decisions]{.mark}** around tens of millions of varied goods
and services?]{.underline}

From Mises onward, [the [Austrian School considers]{.mark}]{.underline}
that [[social ownership]{.mark} of the means of production necessarily
implies]{.underline} the [imposition of [a "**single will**]{.mark}" on
economic performance, with a central planning organism where all
productive decisions will be made, down to the smallest
detail]{.underline}. Thus, in opposition to the decentralization of
capitalism, socialism is where "the employment of all factors of
production is directed by one agency only. One alone chooses, decides,
directs, acts, gives orders. All the rest simply obey orders and
instructions" (Mises, 1998, 692). The [problem with such a
system]{.underline}, according to Mises, [is that the planning agency
cannot be in a position to know the best uses for all means to achieve
the proposed goals]{.underline}, and thus to organize the overall social
division of labor, since the economic authority cannot be composed of
"omniscient and infallible beings."

[[This is]{.underline}]{.mark}, without [[a]{.underline}]{.mark} doubt,
[one of the most characteristic **[misapprehension]{.mark}**s **of the
critics of communism**]{.underline}. The first clarification required
here is that [economic [planning]{.mark}]{.underline} (like social
ownership) [[does not]{.mark} in any way [require]{.mark} a
[single]{.mark} level or instance of [decision-making]{.mark} which
programs an economy down to the last detail, but rather]{.underline}
that the [distribution of skills among the numerous areas, levels, and
agents]{.underline} (ICs, authorities, businesses, users and consumers,
etc.) [proves coherent and ensures that the overall decision-making
process be organic]{.underline} (Laibman, 2002, 2011; Campbell, 2002;
Cockshott and Cottrell, 1993). The [**planning agency does not make all
decisions** and **need not be omniscient**. Economic planning merely
constitutes an institutional device that allows]{.underline} the
principle of [conscious, rational, and democratic control of the global
productive process to be operational]{.underline}. As such, [the
socialist model is the economic basis of self-government in a society in
which [decisions are made]{.mark} and their implementation conducted
**[by those]{.mark} who are [affected]{.mark}**[, in]{.mark} two
fundamental aspects: [production]{.mark}]{.underline} (workplace,
company, sector, national economy) [[and territory]{.underline}]{.mark}
(locality, region, country).

[[Based on current]{.mark} information and communication
**[tech]{.mark}**nologies, a democratically [planned economy]{.mark}
would [function as]{.mark} a **[distributed system]{.mark},
simultaneously centralized and decentralized**, not unlike the
internet]{.underline}. Such a system [[would permit]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[management of **info**]{.mark}rmation flows [in real time]{.mark},
articulating knowledge and local decisions within]{.underline} the
[framework of a general plan]{.underline}. [**As a centralized system it
[would benefit from coherence]{.mark}**[, with access to **all
resources** and]{.mark} the **[efficiency to mobilize]{.mark} them
[quickly]{.mark}** toward democratically chosen objectives.
**[As]{.mark} a [decentralized]{.mark} system,**]{.underline} [it [could
articulate]{.mark} initiative and [local knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline}
(including autonomous relationships among companies to agree on the
specific inputs required in each case) [as well as **[independence from
systemic failure]{.mark}**]{.underline} (that is, burden sharing so that
if a certain component fails, others can continue to operate).

The need for [coherent coordination and strategic vision requires
centralization]{.underline}, while the need for [detailed information
and]{.underline} the promotion of [free and local initiative
require]{.underline} some degree of [decentralization]{.underline}.
Decisions would be made at one or another level depending on the nature
of the decision in question. Thus, [decisions that require broad
coordination to achieve an optimal result would **have to be
sufficiently centralized**]{.underline} (to avoid parallel decisions or
blind dynamics), while [decisions requiring detailed local information
and which are free of coordination problems]{.underline} (for example,
the variety and specific characteristics of the means of consumption)
[would necessarily be decentralized]{.underline}. [**Here
[decentralization adopts a non-commercial form]{.mark}**, because **[in
no case would there be private control over resources or
investment]{.mark}**]{.underline}.6 In greater detail:

Introduction

At the present moment, the world is in the grip of a global pandemic and
economic crisis, the full effect of which will likely not be fully
realized for years to come. Based on data from the European Center for
Disease Control (ECDC), as of July 26, 2020, there have been 644,832
confirmed deaths globally due to the Novel coronavirus (COVID-19), a
total that is likely to be higher than reported as testing and reporting
capacity varies greatly across the globe (Roser, et al., 2020).
Worldwide death projections from this pandemic also vary a great deal,
with most projections providing three main scenarios: mandated mask use,
quarantine softening, and the mean between the two (Institute for Health
Metrics and Evaluation, 2020). Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Data Scientist, Gu, projects that as of November 1, 2020, the mean
number of deaths total will be 222,047 in the United States, 201,995 in
Europe, and 660,183 in the rest of the world for a total of 1,084,225
deaths worldwide (2020). Meanwhile, the World 12 Bank and others warn
that the associated economic shutdown is already signaling "the deepest
global recession in decades" (Figure 1), with "emerging markets and
developing countries" suffering the worst outcomes (Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development, 2020; World Bank, 2020ab).

Growth rates for emerging and developing countries were already slowing
pre-COVID-19 and forecasts estimate major setbacks in accumulative
output and production at negative eight points over the next five years
at a 90% confidence rate (World Bank, 2020b). It's easy to forget that
major decreases and production translate into unprecedented unemployment
levels for millions of people.

\[Figure omitted\]

Worldwide, second-quarter 2020 unemployment is predicted as high as
11.9% or 340 million jobs lost, affecting women the most as 40% of women
work in the services sector (Figure 2), one of the most gravely impacted
sectors of this economic downturn (International Labour Organization,
2020). Other factors that impact women include participation in the
informal workforce which may not be included in these numbers, the
difference between temporary job loss (where unemployment and other
social safety net services are available) and permanent job loss, gaps
in gender pay, and employment which previously persisted, and the
ever-present vulnerability of domestic workers which are overwhelmingly
female and migrant in most cases. Last, many women work as unpaid care
workers. Any gains in gender equity are quickly deteriorating.

The World Bank projects a contraction of -5.2% in the global economy due
to key factors that include, extreme uncertainty and speed to which the
pandemic has presented (underlying root cause); \"how deep, how wide and
how synchronized" the recession has hit global economies as a group; a
shock to developing countries where millions of people are already in
extreme poverty, and the additional loss of income will push more people
into poverty with public resources already limited or insufficient;
long-term negative effects for developing countries' ability to service
their debt, attract foreign direct investment, create social safety nets
and continue much-needed capacity building; and best-case economic
scenario projections of a global contraction of -4% are "devastating\"
(2020b). Projections from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) increase the global economic contraction estimate to
-7.5% in the event of a single wave and -9.3%, should a second wave of
the pandemic emerge (Figure 3), nearly doubling the estimate of the
World Bank in the worst-case scenario (2020).

Despite the devastating forecast in the near and long-term, researchers
see a silver lining insomuch as this period may be an opportunity to
rebuild in "unprecedented ways" (Ted.com, 2020; Lu, 2020). So far,
states and financial institutions are responding predictably as lenders
of last resort. However, in the face of another global market failure,
it is clear that global financial governance coordination and reforms by
states and international organizations (IOs), such as the United States,
European Union, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over the last
12 years have done little to prevent the increasing chaos of the present
moment (Momani, 2018, p. 591).

Beyond the health and economic threats outlined previously, the
spillover threat to the maintenance of international peace and security
are many. On April 9, 2020, before the UN Security Council,

A report by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
highlights the root causes of the current state and institutional
delegitimization which include polarization, conflicting expert
information, miscommunication, abuse of power, and lack of
accountability (Resnick, 2020).

The Imagination of Collective Intelligence (CI) During Chaos

At an estimated and growing \$9 trillion dollars of aggregate global
emergency response spending and lending (Battersby et al., 2020), the
difference in state and IO policy and reforms underway underpin a
growing global financial crisis and threat to the maintenance of world
peace. Who might assume the risk if and when this bubble bursts?

The 2008 financial crisis which represented the long-term outcome of
mature neoliberal capitalism arose due to "an asset bubble of such great
proportions that it enable\[d\] a large part of the population to borrow
and consume beyond its means" (Kotz, 2009). Katz estimates that "another
expansion, within the existing neoliberal model, would require a new
asset bubble even more massive than the housing bubble, and it is
difficult to imagine how this could arise." To what extent, if at all,
might a debt bubble create a market failure this time around?

Might this pandemic and financial crisis be the unimaginable perfect
storm to create the social-democratic, capital-labor compromise needed
to force government intervention in restructuring capitalism? (Haworth
N. and Hughes, S., 2018; Kotz, 2009; Sinclair, 2018) Such
post-structuralism propositions of global governance highlight the
"forms of organization and cooperation that exceed, and therefore
fundamentally problematize, the sovereign imaginary of politics"
(Brassett, 2018, p. 195). Who will lead us through this crisis?

Mazzucato's essay, *The COVID Crisis is a Chance to do Capitalism
Differently* and subsequent TedTalk on the subject urges us to "Do
everything we can not to go back to normal," arguing the current
neoliberal capitalist system is what led us to the present three-factor
(not two-factor) state of unprecedented global crisis (2020; Ted.com,
2020). In addition to the health crisis previously discussed, she
highlights the economic crisis through the lens of problematic corporate
and governance structures that perpetuate financial crises that end up
"financing themselves" with public funds enabled by problematic
governments that do nothing more than fix their way from one market
failure to the next.

This [enabling environment further]{.underline}
**[[exacerbates]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the]{.underline} **[ever-present
[environmental crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}**--- while the rest of the
world is distracted by the health and financial crises, neoliberal
capitalists and their apparatus lobby for emergency easing of
regulations, tax breaks, and other special [accommodations that feed
the]{.underline} aforementioned **[bubbles]{.underline}** [to disastrous
additional consequences]{.underline} (Centre for Research on Energy and
Clean Air, 2020; Ross, 2020).

Experts agree that the root cause, at least to a high degree, is the
underlying contracts that hold together the corporate-government-civil
society ecosystem (Sinclair, 2020, p. 386, 388; Ted.com 2020).
Reimagining this ecosystem will require market co-creation, argues
Mazzucato, which begins with a mindset of being "an active market shaper
and co-creator \[who develop\] capabilities to create, to think outside
of the box, to be dynamic and flexible." She continues, "This agenda
needs new economic theory and also curriculum for bureaucrats." In other
words, state and institutional actors who are capable of leading
incredible movements of change that inspire and engage from the
bottom-up and top-down at the margin in co-creation through collective
intelligence.

Harnessing Collective Intelligence of Non-State Actors

Collective intelligence (CI) was coined by Dr. Douglas Engelbart as a
construct in the pursuit of high-performing organizations with
"ever-increasing speed, agility, precision, and vision---extending
beyond improvements to their perception and reflexes, to include
boosting their reasoning, memory, foresight, learning, and planning
abilities as well" (Engelbart, 1994, page 10). Bootstrapping CI beings
with people in an organizational unit (i.e., corporations,
organizations, communities, even nations) with knowledge processes that
produce a knowledge product (i.e., proposals, plans, budgets, legal
contracts) across domains in an ideal status wherein its current project
status is transparent and available to all, leading to organizational
memory and an evolving knowledge base, known as CoDIAK - the Concurrent
Development Integration and Application of Knowledge (page 12). CoDIAK
is highly interdisciplinary and when cooperation exists between large
organizations, it "puts new demands on knowledge-work interchange" (page
18).

It is not enough to have processes that produce knowledge within an
organization, the key element is a vision to extend beyond what is
currently known and seen as possible. The most successful outcomes
possess a diverse cohort of contributors and collaborators who, in the
present context, collectively seek to dissolve the chaos, the "societal
challenges that are characteristically volatile, uncertain, complex and
ambiguous," in co-creation (or co-design) locally and globally toward
"integral sustainability" (Alfoqahaa and Jones, 2020; Laszlo, 2017; van
Egmond, 2011). Such a transdisciplinary approach to solving our present
crisis of humanity, stemming from inequalities created by neoliberal
capitalism, is urgent so that we may avoid an additional fourth
crisis---increased conflict and violence which will further exacerbate
the first three crises in a zero-sum game, a game in which everybody
loses (Schockman et al., 2019; Weiss and Wilkinson, 2017, p. 587-589;
Aboelela, et al., 2007.)

Taking Interdisciplinary Visionary Leadership to a Global
Transdisciplinary Context

Alfoqahaa and Jones (2020) present a compelling argument about what is
required to lead sustainable equitable change during chaos, specifically
the construct of cultural diversity leadership which can emerge in the
context of any given time and space (p. 235). They propose a multi-level
model that mediates the two extremes of chaos and complexity theory
through cultural diversity leadership, a process whereby a leader
emerges and is sustained from the bottom-up and is able to
simultaneously transform chaos (a state of cultural diversity conflict)
into complexity (a state of cultural diversity integration) from the
top-down (p. 218).

Characteristically, the process of leadership emergence and
sustainability is similar to Hollander's "idiosyncrasy credits" whereby
a leader's legitimization is built and sustained on a form of social
capital derived through common group membership which presumably assumes
a high level of cultural competency (Schockman et al, 2019, p. 5).
Alfoqahaa et al. extend this concept to include the transformative power
of the leader to mediate the conflict that is often present in the
context of a nation, specifically, "relational, global and social
paradigms \[that are\] a complex social dynamic system" - the chaos into
the complex state of peace through integration or an interdisciplinary
approach (p. 218).

Their model shares interesting characteristics with Englebart and
others' frameworks of CI at the organizational unit level. Figure 5
integrates these frameworks into a single map, capturing the two key
organizing elements of complexity (the harmonious state of integration),
the catalyzing event through which conflicted constituents may fall into
cooperation (enter into collective dynamic) from which the leader
emerges. "Leader tags emerge out of and owe their existence to
interactive dynamics but they rarely create an interactive dynamic
themselves; rather they are produced by the dynamic" (Alfoqahaa et al.,
2019, p. 236).

\[Figure omitted\]

Anticipating the need to move beyond an interdisciplinary approach to
one that is transdisciplinary in nature, is what Engelbart (1994)
foreshadows in the exponential benefit of the "knowledge-work
interchange" scenario between two large organizations (applied in this
context to nations and/or international organizations) (1994, page 14).
In this application, we propose the idea of transunity as opposed to
integration as the desired complex state of harmony. If the pursuit is
global governance that benefits multiple organizations simultaneously
(i.e., nations or other constructs of social worlds by Engelbart's
definition), might the aim be to generate a
leadership-knowledge-work-interchange between them so that their CI
output enhances their respective approaches and leadership in unity (not
uniformity) accounting for their various configurations, cultural
contexts and stages of development over time (Jensenius, 2012)? Perhaps
an open-ended construct of transunity (transdisciplinary) as opposed to
intraunity (interdisciplinary)? The difference between examining the
outputs (or transformations) which are produced from the CI of social
worlds as a whole and examining those produced from the CI of the
network of social worlds that make up the whole? Thereby allowing us to
transcend the time and space of the synchronic---and the diachronic of
its parts as part of the whole as well (Cox, R., 2018, p. 162).

The Way Forward

What might constructing the new normal look like? Park (2018) brings
clarity to this question of international interaction, "Not only to
highlight the role of IOs in classifying and categorizing the world but
also in midrange theorizing alongside rationalist approaches to explain
how norms advanced by IOs and states intersect with material interests
to create new categories of action" (p. 147).

To what extent, if at all, are IOs "changing the rules and norms"
through CI toward equitable outcomes---or reinforcing existing ones to
maintain the status quo?

A Changing World Paradigm?

The latest Congressional Research Report signals a conflict between the
different policy approaches of the US and other actors, highlighting and
expressing concern about the potential threat that these differences
may, "inflict longer-term damage to the global economy by impairing
international political, trade, and economic relations, particularly
between countries that promote nationalism and those that argue for a
coordinated international response to the pandemic" (Weiss et al., 2020,
p. 1).

This conflict in policy priority reflects, on one hand, culturally
diverse leaders who have emerged through the collective dynamic (i.e.,
the Eurozone) in action realizing their collective output (response) to
the catalyzing pandemic crisis is of greater value than if they acted
alone, and on the other hand, a charismatic leader (i.e., Trump)
grounded in xenophobic nationalism in action through the CI of a much
smaller organizational unit whose main interest appears to be
self-preservation at the expense, exclusion, and accusation of
"non-natives," internally and externally (Betz, 2017; Immelman, 2017).

What questions and concerns might these challenges between existing
alliances present in terms of overcoming this seemingly insurmountable
crisis for the whole and sum of the world's parts?

Increasing Debt Bubble

Weiss et al. also warm of a "solvency crisis," particularly facing
developing countries whose expense ratio is expected to double,
increasing the likelihood of defaults due to high debt levels which,
"could become 'unmanageable' and test the resilience of banks in some
countries" (p. 7). To make matters worse, the globe is pegged to the US
dollar making the Federal Reserve Bank the de-facto global governor of
fiscal policy, influencer of market mechanisms that have some corrective
measures during a non-crises state, while also serving as a primary
lender to central banks who, if faced with illiquidity, will have no
present way to meet emergency cash flow needs (p. 29).

Of concern is [the]{.underline} **[["unsustained
expansion"]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that]{.underline} neoliberal
**[capitalism]{.underline}** [requires]{.underline}. Most Multilateral
Development Banks (MDBs) have more conservative fiduciary rules that
underpin accountability contracts between states and IOs which should
work, at least in part, to protect the most vulnerable developing
countries they serve. Sinclair asserts, "the essence of structured
finance is to be found in the legal rights to revenues organized in the
contracts and trusts that underpin the securities\...[the]{.underline}
\[previous\] **[global financial crisis]{.underline}** [has [not been
kind]{.mark}]{.underline} to anyone, but it [has highlighted
the]{.underline} necessary and **[vital role]{.underline}** [of
government in times of upheaval]{.underline}" (p. 366, 388).

The US is in the process of pushing for fiduciary reforms which will
allow for increased callable capital to dramatically increase the
liquidity of four MDBs it is a member of---two at the World Bank and two
at the African Development Bank. This callable capital will support US
interests through investment in infrastructure to fight terrorism,
developing and opening markets for US business interests, and "drive
private sector investment and growth, promoting rules and policies
around lending that are conducive to U.S. interests" (U.S. Department of
the Treasury, International Programs, 2020.) Figure 7 displays US levels
of callable capital in its member MDBs for fiscal year 2019
(pre-COVID-19).

\[Figure omitted\]

These investments use callable capital without the reserve capital in
hand (a concern that has to date not manifested, as no MDB has ever had
to make this call.) However, Sinclair points to the relationship between
"narrow interests" and, "in times of crisis, such interests can make
crises worse" (p. 389). To what extent, if at all, might current
conditions of the crises create illiquidity at MDBs, requiring a call on
callable debt that may not be available? What or who makes up the
"narrow interests" Sinclair warns us of in the current crises?

Perhaps the question is where---from where might these narrow interests
emerge to "make crises better or worse?" To step into transunity or away
from it? To illustrate this point, Weiss (2020) explains how the North
American Development Bank (NADB) was created in 1994 to mitigate
concerns created by the increased economic activity of the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), particularly concerns related to
the environment (p. 1). Its main purpose is to fund public and private
infrastructure projects on both sides of the border, which over the last
five years have strained its resources causing a change in credit rating
requiring a higher capital adequacy ratio.

Competition from private finance, independent oversight to ensure
technical, environmental, and social integrity along with changing
executive administrations have resulted in current legislation that has
shifted project focus from green energy to fossil fuels and mandated
financing reforms. These reforms are to "develop and implement
efficiency improvements to streamline and accelerate the project
certification and financing process" (p. 3). Might the "where" be found
in the processes of the collective dynamic? In the output of enabling
contracts that hold together the corporate-government-civil society
ecosystem as Mazzucato argues (Ted.com, 2020)? In this case, enabling
the status-quo of neoliberal capitalism and deterioration of an
institution whose contracts were conditioned to mitigate environmental
risk?

Coordinated International Response

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) an IO
of 37 member countries, called for "immediate, large-scale and
coordinated actions" which included "(1) more international cooperation
to address the health crisis; (2) coordinated government actions to
increase spending to support health care, individuals, and firms; (3)
coordinated central bank action to supervise and regulate financial
markets; and (4) policies directed at restoring confidence" (Weiss et
al., p. 34). Although this "call" isn't a contract per se, it's a first
step in what Mazzucato calls "joining the club to show you are part of
the solution," the entry point into what she also called the "dynamic
capabilities of the public sector," dynamic capabilities created by CI
(ted.com, 2020).

Mazzucato [argues]{.underline} that [**[market
co-creation]{.underline}** [requires]{.underline}]{.mark}
[a]{.underline} **[[shift]{.underline}]{.mark}** [from the mindset and
system [that enables]{.mark}]{.underline} **[["lender of last
resort]{.mark} outcomes"]{.underline}** [to outcomes]{.underline} that
are [[created by]{.mark} being]{.underline} **[["investors of first
resort"]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Ted.com, 2020). She
[contends]{.underline} that [in addition to]{.underline} **[creating
value]{.underline}** [for the public]{.underline} through public
investments and creating a return on investment, [these public
investments must be]{.underline} **[mission-driven]{.underline}** and
project-based. An example of such a mission is the European Central Bank
(ECB) which in March 2020 reported its efforts to structurally focus, as
part of its larger integration efforts in the region, on green
initiatives and investment to decarbonize European Union investment
(2020). They are explicit in detailing their mission to "green" the EU
economy through green bonds and other measures which are more effective
than traditional debt-based initiatives over time.

Figure 8 shows the relationship between shifting away from "brown" debt
to "green" equity. Although it is a long-term vision, this move will end
up greening the entire region, from the economy to the environment; from
jobs to industry; from the health and well-being of its citizens to
those around the world. It will create an enabling environment and model
of CI that produces contracts and public benefit for those at the local
level to those at the global level.

\[Figure omitted\]

Germany is another example of an investor of the first resort in the
green mission. In June 2020, German Minister of Economic Affairs and
Energy, Peter Altmaier, announced the acquisition of an approximate 23%
stake in CureVac, a pharmaceutical company that has developed a
promising vaccine for COVID-19 (Bratulic, 2020). For Germany, this
contract represents a move to protect its national security amid
attempts from Trump to make a deal with the company for exclusive US
use, this corporate-government-civil society contract ensures that the
vaccine will be available to everyone at a reasonable market rate while
creating a return on investment for the German public (Schüller, 2020).

Conclusion

How might the global network of social [worlds]{.underline} (i.e., IOs,
states, and non-state actors) [leverage this]{.underline} **[catalyzing
present]{.underline}** [moment to lead]{.underline} us [in
a]{.underline} **[collective]{.underline}** [dynamic toward harmonious
outcomes]{.underline}? Or [are we destined for]{.underline} **[greater
chaos, conflict, and violence]{.underline}**? The proposed construct of
transunity is characteristic of a type of [shared
[governance]{.mark}]{.underline}---an output of reimagined and
co-created corporate-government-civil society global
ecosystem---[capable of [enabling]{.mark}]{.underline} fluid, integral,
and **[sustainable]{.underline}** [[unification despite]{.underline}

[**[reducing]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the likelihood of]{.underline}
**[additional [existential risks]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [such as market
failures, war or mutual destruction]{.underline}.

Think tanks, international organizations, non-state actors, and global
policy networks are examples of potentially influential culturally
diverse leaders engaged in CI throughout the world. One such institution
is the University College London (UCL) Institute of Innovation in Public
Policy (IIPP), founded by Mariana Mazzucato in 2017 and known for its,
"radical thinking about space, design, and sustainability." IIPP is on a
mission to, "[[change how]{.underline} **[public value
is]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[imagined, [practiced]{.mark} and
evaluated]{.underline}** [to tackle societal challenges and
achieve]{.underline} economic [growth [that is]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[more]{.underline}** [innovation-led]{.underline}]{.mark}[,
sustainable and inclusive]{.underline}" (UCL Institute for Innovation
and Public Purpose, n.d.). Mazzucato's leadership and work have already
influenced new policies in states and regions around the globe, from the
EU to the Vatican (Ted.com, 2020)

A suggestion, for the sake of thought: [[If industrial
**civ**]{.mark}ilization [collapsed]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[it]{.underline}]{.mark} probably **[[could not be
rebuilt]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Civilization would exist again, of
course, but [industry appears to be a **one-time
experiment**]{.underline}. The [astronomist Fred Hoyle]{.underline},
exaggerating slightly, [writes]{.underline}:

It has often been said that, if the human species fails to make a go of
it here on Earth, some other species will take over the running. In the
sense of developing high intelligence this is not correct. [[We
have]{.underline}]{.mark}, or soon will have,
[[exhausted]{.underline}]{.mark} the necessary **[[physical
prerequisites]{.underline}]{.mark}** so far as this planet is concerned.
With [[coal]{.underline}]{.mark} gone, [[oil]{.underline}]{.mark} gone,
high-grade [[metallic ores gone]{.underline}]{.mark}, [**[no
species]{.mark}** however competent [can]{.mark}]{.underline} make the
long [[climb]{.underline}]{.mark} from primitive conditions [[to
high-level **tech**]{.mark}nology]{.underline}. This is a one-shot
affair. If we fail, this planetary system fails so far as intelligence
is concerned. The same will be true of other planetary systems. On each
of them there will be one chance, and one chance only.

Hoyle overstates all the limits we actually have to worry about, but
there are enough to affirm his belief that industry is a "one-shot
affair." In other words, [if industry collapsed]{.underline} then no
matter how quickly scientific knowledge allows societies to progress,
[technical development will **hit a wall**]{.underline} because the
builders will not have the needed materials. For example, much of the
world's [land is not arable]{.underline}, and some of the land in use
today is only productive because of industrial technics developed
during the agricultural revolution in the 60s, technics [heavily
dependent on **oil**]{.underline}. Without the systems that sustain
industrial agriculture much current farm land could not be farmed;
agricultural civilizations cannot exist there, at least until the soil
replenishes, if it replenishes.

And some [[resources]{.mark} required for industrial
progress]{.underline}, like coal, simply [[are not]{.mark} **feasibly
[accessible]{.mark}**]{.underline} anymore. Tainter writes:

. . . major jumps in population, at around A.D. 1300, 1600, and in the
late eighteenth century, each led to intensification in agriculture and
industry. As the land in the late Middle Ages was increasingly
deforested to provide fuel and agricultural space for a growing
population, basic heating, cooking, and manufacturing needs could no
longer be met by burning wood. A shift to reliance on coal began,
gradually and with apparent reluctance. Coal was definitely a fuel
source of secondary desirability, being more costly to obtain and
distribute than wood, as well as being dirty and polluting. Coal was
more restricted in its spatial distribution than wood, so that a whole
new, costly distribution system had to be developed. Mining of coal from
the ground was more costly than obtaining a quantity of wood equivalent
in heating value, and became even more costly as the 54 most accessible
reserves of this fuel were depleted. Mines had to be sunk ever deeper,
until groundwater flooding became a serious problem.

Today, most easily accessible natural coal reserves are completely
depleted. Thus, [societies]{.underline} in the wake of our imagined
collapse [would not]{.underline} be able to [**develop fast enough** to
reach]{.underline} the underground **[coal]{.underline}**.

As a result of these limits, [[rebuilding]{.underline}]{.mark} industry
[would [take]{.mark}]{.underline} at least thousands of years --- it
took **[[10,000 years]{.underline}]{.mark}** the first time around. [By
the time a civilization]{.underline} reached the point where it [could
do something]{.underline} about industrial scientific knowledge
[[it]{.mark} probably [would not have]{.mark} the
**[knowledge]{.mark}**]{.underline} anymore. It would have to develop
its sciences and technologies on its own, resulting in patterns of
development that would probably look similar to historical patterns.
Technology today depends on levels of complexity that must proceed in
chronological stages. Solar panels, for example, rely on transportation
infrastructure, mining, and a regulated division of labor. And
historically the [process of developing]{.underline} into a global
civilization [includes]{.underline} numerous instances of **[technical
regression]{.underline}**. The natives of **[Tasmania]{.underline}**,
for example, [went from a **maritime society** to one that **didn't
fish**]{.underline}, build boats, or make bows and arrows.

[[Individuals]{.mark} might [**survive** for]{.mark} a

Staying indoors for 48 hours after a nuclear blast is now recommended.

survivors, [their [social]{.mark} and [**governmental structure**

big nuclear question --- so big that it's best left unanswered, since
only an all-out nuclear war could decide it definitively.

#### It'd cease [all human activities]{.underline}.

Laurentian University; CBC, "What you won\'t learn about in Oppenheimer:
the potential effects of a nuclear winter,"

If you\'re wondering if nuclear winter would stop global warming,
you\'re not alone. It\'s a question Robock gets all the time. [A
full-scale **[nuclear war]{.mark}** and a global **famine** resulting
from **nuclear winter** would lead to the [collapse]{.mark} of
[**industrial society** and]{.mark} human
**[civilization]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Robock said that if the U.S. and
Russia had a nuclear war, it would [largely [**halt** carbon
**emissions**]{.mark}, since [most **human activities**]{.mark} would
have **[ceased]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

\"The amount \[of carbon\] that\'s in the atmosphere would gradually go
down, be absorbed in the ocean --- we have about a half a degree or a
degree of built-in warming right now, so there would be a little bit of
extra, additional warming. But it would basically stop,\" he said.

Human-caused climate change poses the threat of an average global
temperature change of several degrees on the timescale of decades.
Nuclear winter, on the other hand, poses that danger on the timescale of
years --- even within a year.

\"A nuclear war\'s impact on global food systems comes as a shock. It
basically comes overnight. [[There\'s **no way** to
**adapt**]{.underline}]{.mark},\" said Jonas Jaegermeyr, a climate
scientist and crop modeller who studies nuclear winter at Columbia
University in New York.

#### Future [development]{.underline} becomes [impossible]{.underline}.

**Flude '23** \[Gillian; February 11; Project Officer at Mines Action
Canada; Mines Action Canada, "Nuclear weapons can destroy development in
an instant,"
https://www.minesactioncanada.org/nuclearweaponsdevelopment\] pbk

The short-term effects of a [**[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon** completely
[destroys]{.mark} any [**development** in]{.mark} the **targeted
[city]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Almost all of the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) would be negatively impacted or
even impossible with the detonation of a nuclear bomb. A singular
nuclear weapon can destroy thousands of homes, hospitals, schools,
roads, water facilities, grocery stores, and more. A concerning point to
keep in mind is that the only nuclear bombs to be used in war time, the
ones detonated over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, had a kiloton (kt) force of
15 kt and 20 kt respectively. A modern nuclear weapon can have a kiloton
force of at least 100, and up to 300 kilotons, and there are
approximately 13,000 of these weapons in the world right now.

Any sustainable [[**development** goal]{.mark} that relates to
**individual** or **community health** is [instantly
**destroyed**]{.mark}, or [set back **decades**]{.mark}]{.underline}. If
a community or city no longer exists, or more than half of its
population has been killed and [[infrastructure destroyed]{.mark}, goals
such as good health and well-being and **quality [education]{.mark}**
are **[doomed]{.mark}** for that area]{.underline}.

The immediate effects of nuclear attack would affect the following SDGs:
No Poverty (SDG #1), Zero Hunger (SDG #2), Good Health and Well-Being
(SDG #3), Quality Education (SDG #4), Gender Equality (SDG #5), Clean
Water and Sanitation (SDG #6), Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG #7) ,
Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG #8), Industry, Innovation, and
Infrastructure (SDG #9), Reduced Inequalities (SDG #10), Sustainable
Cities and Communities (SDG #11), Life on Land (SDG #15), and Peace,
Justice, and Strong Institutions (SDG #16). All of these goals relate to
building a stronger community through infrastructure and planning as
well as the protection of people and the environment. [A **[nuclear
blast]{.mark}** would either instantly [destroy]{.mark} the
[**infrastructure** needed to deliver]{.mark} these [goals]{.mark},
and/or **[kill]{.mark}** the [people w]{.mark}ho the [goals are]{.mark}
meant to be [**achieved** for]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The connection between the destruction of an entire city and sustainable
development is now clear, so we are going to look at how nuclear weapons
harm the environment which in turn affects sustainable development.
Nuclear bombs are radioactive and toxic to people, animals, and the
environment. Mining uranium, testing the weapons, and dumping the waste
all harm the environment before the weapon is even used. Contamination
from nuclear weapons facilities, tests, and in Hiroshima and Nagasaki
lasts decades. [That is [decades of **unsafe water**]{.mark}, unfarmable
[land]{.mark}, **incurable [cancer]{.mark}**, and unimaginable **harm**
long after the initial **blast**]{.underline}.

### Alternative\-\--AT: Transition Wars\-\--2NC

#### Transition war enables [transition]{.underline} to post-capitalist societies.

**Milivojević '18** \[Srećko; 2018; Direct Sales Manager at Wiener
Städtische, Faculty of Economics in Belgrade; Quora, "Would human
civilization ever rebuild after an all-out nuclear war?"
https://www.quora.com/Would-human-civilization-ever-rebuild-after-an-all-out-nuclear-war\]
pbk

Sure, you are assuming "[[all-out]{.underline}]{.mark}"
**[[war]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which means a [couple of thousand
detonations]{.underline}, but a big factor is how ruthless and
discriminate the bombing is.

Common sense says how your first targets should be the offensive
capabilities of your enemy. Meaning, it's safe to assume how the first
round of bombing would be focused on nuclear silos, military facilities,
air and naval ports, command centers. Second round would likely (also
safe to assume) target industrial complexes and economy centers.

Indirectly, you [would still have [**significant damage** to major
**cities**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[You see, the **[biggest threat]{.mark}** after the war [is]{.mark}
certainly [nuclear **winter**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The intensity of nuclear winter [[**depends** on]{.mark} the amount of
**[smoke]{.mark} ejected** into the **atmosphere**]{.underline}.

If we are to assume that world leaders are rational (just for a moment),
civilian targets (cities, which would produce a LOT of smoke if
attacked) are NOT directly attacked.

Still, we'd be having a huge disaster. Let's also for a moment ignore
billions (probably) of dead and incapacitated people, [and the [**total
collapse** of **economy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Let's just focus on the
environmental consequences.

Carl Sagan and his team discussed a scenario a couple of decades ago,
where 2600 nuclear weapons are detonated, including a fraction of the
remaining 7600 weapons some time afterwards. This scenario assumes
hundreds of cities around the world engulfed in firestorms. As a
consequence, [more than [**150 million** tons of **smoke**]{.mark} is
**produced**]{.underline}.

Their team assumes a catastrophic aftermath in this scenario. Their main
argument for this aftermath is the amount of smoke ejected.

But then again, they also assumed completely indiscriminate bombing.

Let's put this as the worst case scenario, and my case above where only
strategic targets are attacked as the "rational" scenario.

[The **[worse case scenario]{.mark}** gives us 1--3 years of
**temperatures** below **freezing** all **year-round**]{.underline}.
That's...bad.

Afterwards, [you'd be having probably a [decade of
classic-**winter-like** years]{.mark}. Still [bad, but
**manageable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Growing food outside would be near
impossible. With time, temperatures would slowly return to normal. Ozone
depletion would be a serious threat to remaining living things. Luckily,
humans are no longer able to further damage it, as the smoke from
industry and vehicles is almost totally gone. Earth's protective layer
would eventually recover.

[Only the [most **resilient** and **sturdiest**]{.mark} of animals
[would **survive**]{.mark} in the **wilderness**]{.underline}. Same goes
for plants.

Most of the living creatures would go extinct.

It would be something similar to dinosaur extinction event.

[But [there would be **survivors**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Flora and fauna
on this Earth survived worse things, and eventually completely
recovered.

I am absolutely sure that, with time, life on Earth would return to
prehuman levels. I can't say it would happen in a hundred years, or even
a thousand. But it most certainly would eventually. No matter how
intense nuclear war was.

Regarding the "rational" scenario, I predict a much less dire aftermath.
You'd still be having nuclear winter effects.

Tambora volcano eruption in 1815 inflicted global consequences. The
world experienced "year without summer", and a lot of people died just
because of the reduced food growing seasons.

My prediction is that we'd be having a similar scenario, but it would
last for decades.

It would still be an extinction event, as many living creatures would
fail to adapt to new environments, but on a much less dire level.

[[As for **humanity**]{.underline}]{.mark}...

[[Whatever the scenario, **we will survive**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[We are among the [most **resilient** and **adaptive**]{.mark} living
[creatures on this **planet**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Worst case scenario [would **bring**]{.mark} **back** our
[**civilization** t]{.mark}o a **[stone-age-level]{.mark}**, and it
would last for several decades, probably a **full
generation**]{.underline}. But we will endure.

[Our [**numbers** would be]{.mark} **drastically [reduced]{.mark}**, but
[we'd still stand in **millions**]{.mark} around the
**world**]{.underline}.

Rational scenario still brings us back to stone age, [as our
[**economy** and **industry**]{.mark} is mostly
**[gone]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Countries and states may still survive,
but you'd be having totalitarian regimes everywhere. A dystopian world
would emerge, where the fight for resources would truly begin.

[[Green capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}

In a ridiculous attempt to address the collapse of the climate from
within the system that produced it, and which continues to exacerbate
it, we have also seen the birth of green capitalism, which [[is entirely
incapable of pursuing an agenda of climate justice]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Greenwashing is a mask on the monster of capital, while [[reformist
policie]{.mark}s like carbon offsets, which allow corporations to trade
their carbon emissions while [do]{.mark}ing [very little to]{.mark}
actually reduce their output of greenhouse gases, are simply unable to
[address]{.mark} [the core of the crisis and avert the impending
catastrophe]{.mark}.]{.underline}

**[[What we require is the reclamation of the
common]{.underline}]{.mark}**s --- that which, like our Earth itself,
justly belongs to everybody and nobody --- from the control of a
capitalist class which has placed our planet in danger. In addressing
the burning [crisis of hunger]{.underline}, for example, we [require
socially owned and controlled food systems, along with a democratised
water commons which function to fill the bellies of all people and not
to fill the pockets of a few.]{.underline}

Likewise, in [addressing unemployment and energy poverty]{.mark}, we
need to urgently [[pursue radical energy alternatives which can provide
clean energy]{.mark} to every household [while]{.mark} simultaneously
[ensuring income and ownership for workers and
communities]{.mark}.]{.underline}

As it stands, Eskom is a polluting corporation which is nonetheless
unable to keep the lights on through its coal-fired power stations. As a
member organisation of the Climate Justice Coalition, the Socialist
Youth Movement echoes the call of the Climate Justice Coalition for a
green new Eskom, which will undergo a deep, just transition to renewable
energy generation at scale. [It must be stressed that these energy
[systems need to be socially owned and democratically managed by workers
and communities]{.mark}]{.underline}.

To address the fact that climate shocks are already here, we
[[require]{.mark} the rapid [expansion of
infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline} (like safe and secure housing, water
and sanitation) to mitigate the impacts that will be hardest felt by the
poor and marginalised. Th[ese interventions must also be [propped up
by]{.mark} other [social protection measures]{.mark} like the
implementation of a R1,500 universal basic income grant which would work
to provide nutrition, security, opportunity and a dignified quality of
life to people severely burdened by the cost-of-living
crisis.]{.underline}

Extractivism, destruction and exploitation

[[Grassroots]{.underline} [community organizations have fought and won
against multinational mining corporations,]{.underline}]{.mark} [despite
the support of the ANC government for these corporations]{.underline}.
The impact of mining on the natural environment, along with the brutal
exploitation of mining capital, culminating in the Marikana massacre in
2012, is radicalizing many young people in South Africa. In the wake of
the democratic dispensation's darkest moment, we marched under the
decolonial banners of #RhodesMustFall and then #FeesMustFall in 2015.

While we breathe new life into the call for free, quality, decolonised
education today, [we must assert that, beyond curricula and pedagogy,
the [decolonisation of our institutions must run deeper]{.mark},
inseparable from the demands to sever ties with bloody mining capital
[and **delink entirely from the interests of the extractivist capitalist
class.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Our existing decolonial discourse, the generational mission which Fanon
warned us not to betray, must situate itself within the context of this
climate crisis. A crisis which does not exist separately from the
broader projects of colonisation and imperial domination.

[All institutions of higher learning [must]{.mark} therefore [divest
from fossil fuels and]{.mark} wash the blood of mining capital from
their hands, [sever]{.mark}ing the [links with all mining
corpora]{.mark}tions [and]{.mark} subsequently with [every institution
of capital]{.mark}.]{.underline} We hold that a decolonised,
de-corporatised education system must capacitate students for jobs
within a green socialist economy. The green socialist economy is ours to
build.

The system change that the climate crisis demands will not come from
those who have constructed and benefit from the status quo, which
poisons our atmosphere and steals the air from our lungs. **[The
eco-socialist revolution we urgently need [can only come from a mass
movement of an organised and united working
class]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

In articulating a truly revolutionary programme to define a world beyond
the waking nightmare of capitalism, it is necessary for our socialism to
be an internationalist, intersectional eco-socialism for the masses.
[[Anything less is a denial of the political and material realities of
our historical moment]{.underline}]{.mark}, a denial of the reality that
the alternative to eco-socialism isn't business as usual under the
farcical stability of capitalism.

As the ticking clock continues to be unheard by the ruling classes, [the
more probable it becomes that we'll find ourselves at the actual,
mortifying alternative: our extinction.]{.underline} DM/MC

Here Marx's observation on the function of the state executive under
capitalism continues to ring true. The [[notion that]{.mark} the
[capitalist state serve]{.mark}s and defends the common [interests of
people is]{.mark} [exposed as a farce. Rather]{.mark},]{.underline}
[it]{.mark} [i[s]{.mark} "but a [committee for managing]{.mark} the
[common affairs of]{.mark} the whole [bourgeoisie]{.mark}]{.underline}".

[Mining remains a sickening legacy of colonial extraction in the Global
South, adding immensely to the environmental devastation of our
communities and the suffering of our people]{.underline}. The effects of
air pollution, radiation and lead poisoning, and other toxic outputs of
the mining industry have also gone unaddressed.

The Princess mine dump in Soweto is the world's largest tailing dam.
Roughly 300m away is the community of Snake Park, where extreme exposure
to toxins is inescapable. A 2017 report by the Bench Marks Foundation
found [communities proximal to mine dumps have significantly higher
rates of respiratory ailments, with two-thirds of households in
Doornkop, an informal settlement in Snake Park, being
affected.]{.underline}

In addition, exposure to radioactive material during pregnancy increases
the risk of fatal miscarriages and is likely to lead to stunted growth,
deformities and the development of abnormalities in brain function,
leading to disorders like cerebral palsy. This was found to be
commonplace in Snake Park, which is just one example of thousands in
South Africa, a country wherein more than 6,000 abandoned and improperly
closed mine dumps and shafts litter the landscape.

In many cases, our "[[leaders"]{.mark} have [dodged all
accountability]{.mark} and have [failed to tend]{.mark} to the [needs of
affected communities]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Not only has the state
allowed those responsible for these long-term effects of the
mining-related health crises to disappear with their
profits]{.underline}, but it [still remains absent from the equation as
well --- **[neglecting to offer financial]{.mark}** and social [support
to affected communities]{.mark}]{.underline}. More often than not, women
are left to fill the void through the provision of additional labour in
the form of social and care work. This exacerbates the disproportionate
impacts of environmental degradation on poor black communities, and on
poor black women in particular.

Despite visible devastation and collapse[, [capitalist enterprise
remains married to the logic of extraction and destruction in pursuit of
profits]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} This [is [exemplified
by]{.mark} Total Energies']{.underline} quest to build the [[East
African Crude Oil Pipeline]{.underline}]{.mark} which [[threatens to
displace more than 400 communities]{.mark} in Uganda and Tanzania [and
pollute the water sources]{.mark} that [40 million people depend
o]{.mark}n for livelihood and sustenance.]{.underline}

[[We must never allow ourselves to normalise a state of affairs in which

endangered]{.underline}. But the report says these [practices are on the
rise]{.underline}: the world\'s raw timber harvest has increased by 45
percent since 1970, and [[55 percent of the world\'s oceans]{.mark} are
[covered by industrial fishing]{.mark}.]{.underline}

These practices also exploit people. [The forestry industry displaces
indigenous people from the United States to Cameroon to
Brazi]{.underline}l . Commercial fishing, too, [[threatens global
indigenous populations who depend on fish for food]{.underline}]{.mark}
. And in the United States, logging and fishing are also among the most
dangerous industries for workers. The federal Bureau of Labor
Statistics\' Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries found that they were
the two deadliest industries in 2019. For every 100,000 workers, the
logging industry saw 135.9 deaths on the job, and commercial fishing saw
86 deaths.

Globally, working conditions are even worse.
[Thailand\'s [fisheries](https://go-gale-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/ps/i.do?p=ITOF&u=umuser&id=GALE%7CA661665759&v=2.1&it=r&cookieConsent=true&analyticsOptout=false&aty=ip)]{.underline},
from where much of the United States\' pet and livestock feed is
sourced, [continue to literally enslave migrants from Cambodia and
Myanmar. As fishing stocks have depleted and maritime labor laws have
been dismantled in recent years, the industry has reportedly enslaved
more people.]{.underline} And it\'s not just Thai fisheries. Reports
have found that [Brazil\'s timber industry holds workers hostage in
logging camps and forces them to perform life-threatening
labor.]{.underline}

The IPBES says the third-biggest driver of the biodiversity crisis
is [climate
change](https://go-gale-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/ps/i.do?p=ITOF&u=umuser&id=GALE%7CA661665759&v=2.1&it=r&cookieConsent=true&analyticsOptout=false&aty=ip),
which is inextricable from the other culprits. **[[Industrial
agriculture is responsible for 13 percent of global carbon
emissions]{.mark},]{.underline}** making it the second-largest emitter
behind the energy sector. Logging has a massive impact on climate
change, too, not only because forests actively sequester carbon, but
also because incinerating
logged [trees](https://go-gale-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/ps/i.do?p=ITOF&u=umuser&id=GALE%7CA661665759&v=2.1&it=r&cookieConsent=true&analyticsOptout=false&aty=ip) to
generate energy, a practice known as \"woody biomass,\" emits even more
CO2 than burning coal.

social factors, including paradigms, goals and value]{.underline}s,\"

unintentionally by corporate activity, [[and]{.mark}]{.underline} is
dismantling [[dozens of environmental protections on air and water
pollution]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The report summary is full of grim news, too. [[[Environmental

reduced]{.mark} the [productivity of 23 percent]{.mark} [o]{.mark}f the

of [millions of people]{.mark} are at [increased risk of floods]{.mark}
and storms because of degraded coastal habitats. Since 1980, [plastic

shocking [[85]{.mark} percent of
[global [wetlands](https://go-gale-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/ps/i.do?p=ITOF&u=umuser&id=GALE%7CA661665759&v=2.1&it=r&cookieConsent=true&cookieConsent=true&analyticsOptout=false&analyticsOptout=false&aty=ip)]{.mark} have
been [destroyed]{.mark}]{.underline}. And because of all this, the world
is already in the midst of its sixth major extinction period.
[[Extinctions]{.mark} are [happening at 1,000 times]{.mark} their
[natural speed]{.mark}, with [dozens of species lost each
day]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The [[IPBES advocates]{.mark} for specific policies]{.underline} that
[could curb mass extinction]{.underline}, including
[[reversing]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[expansion of
monoculture]{.underline}]{.mark} and [taking up a [localized approach to
farming]{.mark}]{.underline}, [creating [marine reserves]{.mark} and
[reducing pollution and runoff]{.mark}, and [restoring sovereignty to
indigenous populations]{.mark}, whose lands have seen slower
biodiversity decline.]{.underline} Most importantly, the report
concludes, [global society must [stop prioritizing growth for
profit]{.mark},]{.underline} and instead [[construct an economy]{.mark}
[that serves the needs of people and the planet.]{.mark}]{.underline}

This political [[shift could protect countless human and nonhuman
lives]{.mark} from the existential threat]{.underline} of ecological
collapse - and its drivers. \"By fecklessly consuming the environment,
capital is figuratively sawing off the tree branch it is sitting on,\"
wrote author Ashley Dawson. \"Capital\'s logic is therefore that of a
cancer cell, growing uncontrollably until it destroys the body that
hosts it.\"

This transformation won\'t be easy, but IPBES chair Watson is
optimistic. \"By its very nature, [[transformative change can expect
opposition]{.mark} from those with interests vested in the status quo,
**[but]{.mark} also that such [opposition can be overcome for the
broader public good]{.mark},\" he said.**]{.underline}

If we\'re going to survive, we have no choice but to succeed.

#### Neoliberal climate adaptation is colonial extraction\-\-\-- It exploits labor, knowledge, and ecosystems in the name of climate resilience.

Thomas **Kimberley Anh**,'**24** - Associate Professor in the Department
of Geography, Environment and Urban Studies and Director of the Climate
Justice Field School at Temple University, \"

The fossil fuel and plantation-based extractivism of colonial racial
capitalism (re)produces the vulnerabilizing conditions that make climate
adaptation necessary, but so too do [[neoliberal adaptation measures
drive resource depletion]{.underline}]{.mark}. In coastal areas
worldwide, the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, US Agency for
International Development, Japanese International Cooperation Agency,
World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, and other [[development
institutions]{.mark} have l[oan]{.mark}ed [billions]{.mark} of dollars
[to build water infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline} such as embankments,
sluice gates, and sea walls (e.g. Colven, 2020; Henrique & Tschakert,
2019). [Although intended to mitigate inundation from floods and sea
level rise, [these structures]{.mark} have [disrupted water and sediment
flows]{.mark}, [lead]{.mark}ing [to biod]{.mark}iversity [loss, erosion,
fisheries decline, and loss of navigable waterways]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Le et al., 2007; Lebel et al., 2010). Perversely, [water management
infrastructures also underpin extractive and degrading land-use
practices, such as shrimp farming, that state and development agencies
tout as adaptive to climate change]{.underline} (Paprocki, 2019).

In addition to adaptation-driven depletion of water, soils, and
biodiversity, [[adaptation measures also exploit the labor and
knowledges of vulnerabilized groups]{.underline}]{.mark}. [For example,
the [Blue Gold project in Bangladesh aimed to reduce risks associated
with floods]{.mark}]{.underline}, storm surge, riverbank erosion, and
salinity intrusion [through the construction and maintenance of
circular, earthen embankments called polders]{.underline}. But,
[[despite funding]{.underline}]{.mark} from the Dutch Government [[of
nearly US \$62 million, the project relied on]{.mark} the [labor of
landless contracting societies mostly comprised of
women]{.mark}]{.underline} (Thomas, 2020). Such 'climate adaptation
labor' is distinct from that of professional adaptation planners and
practitioners in that it is often invisibilized, devalued, and depleting
(Johnson et al., 2023).

[[Indigenous peoples]{.mark} and other groups with intimate
knowledge]{.underline} of their environments [are]{.underline} also
[enrolled]{.underline} in adaptation measures [through various forms of
'exclusive inclusion]{.underline}' (Lindroth & Sinevaara-Niskanen,
2014). [Their [knowledge is increasingly valued as relevant for adapting
to climate change]{.mark}, [but may be]{.mark} [extracted,
decontextualized, and subject to foreign norms and laws that fail to
uphold customary rules of use]{.mark}]{.underline} (Klenk et al., 2017;
Williams & Hardison, 2013). Situated knowledge is [necessary for
designing adaptation interventions [and]{.mark} making them workable but
is [devalued in]{.mark} the political [economy of
adaptation]{.mark}.]{.underline} This calculus is evident in the
[[differential treatment of local and foreign knowledge]{.mark}, whereby
the [former is extracted]{.mark}, and the [latter is
commodified]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Commodification

[While [governmental and development institutions]{.mark} recognize the
value of locals\' contextual knowledge, they accord to policy,
scientific, and finance actors the status of 'expert']{.underline}
(Falzon, 2021; Webber, 2015). Again, the Blue Gold 7 of 17 THOMAS
project is exemplary. According to one project document, "The challenges
to realize sustainable development within the polders are technically
complex and institutionally demanding. Dutch knowledge institutes and
private companies in the water and productive sectors will introduce
innovative approaches and technologies to find appropriate solutions in
close coordination and cooperation with Bangladeshi partners" (Blue
Gold, 2012, p. 20, emphasis mine). In other words, [the project
[asserts]{.mark} that the [technical and institutional
managemen]{.mark}t of polders]{.underline}---[structures that
Bangladeshis have been administering for more than 60 years---[exceeds
local capacity and requires continued outside
intervention]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The 'instrumental co-production of
knowledge']{.mark} prefigured by notions of 'coordination and
cooperation' [echoes paternalistic, colonial knowledge
hierarchies]{.mark}]{.underline} (Goldman et al., 2018; Haverkamp, 2021)
[[and structures the commodification of foreign
knowledge.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The [vast [majority of climate adaptation finance]{.mark} is [delivered
as loans]{.mark},]{.underline} which not only [[makes low-income
countries financially responsible for a crisis they did not
cause]{.underline}]{.mark}, but also often
[[stipulates]{.mark}]{.underline} that [recipient [countries employ
foreign experts]{.mark} at exorbitant cost]{.underline} (Carty et al.,
2020[). International consultants earn several times the salaries of
local specialists]{.underline} (Johnson et al., 2023), which is
difficult to reconcile given that the [top climatologists, hydrologists,
engineers, and geologists in countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam train
abroad at the same institutions and in the very programs as their Dutch,
American, British, Japanese, and German counterparts]{.underline}. Once
repatriated, this money subsidizes unsustainable, energy-intensive
lifestyles in the consultants\' home countries.

[Accumulation by adaptation also proceeds through the manufacture of
commodities that promise adaptive benefits, including vulnerability
assessments, risk maps, adaptation plans, and climate
forecasts]{.underline} (Friedman, 2023; Käkönen et al., 2014). 3 In
addition to adaptation planning products, the World Bank also repackages
Green Revolution technologies such as hybridized seeds and drip
irrigation ('drip-kits') as valuable adaptation tools (Ireland &
McKinnon, 2013; Venot, 2016). While its claims are questionable given
the Green Revolution\'s checkered history (Patel, 2013), [redistributive
climate justice might entail widely sharing materials, instruments, and
technical know-how. Instead, precarious groups are forced to buy these
goods and services, their participation in adaptation commodity markets
perversely refracted through their 'willingness to pay' for
vulnerability reduction]{.underline} (e.g. Akter, 2020; Al-Amin et al.,
2020; Micale et al., 2018).

### Socialism\-\--Solvency\-\--2NC

### AT: Socialism Not Popular

### Popular 

#### Mamani NYC victory show gaining popularity of socialist movement 

Jason **Beeferman ,'25**\--  New York State Politics Reporter at
POLITICO covers Gov. Kathy Hochul, the state Legislature and New York\'s
congressional delegation , \"Mamdani's victory would signal seismic
shift in national politics and test for socialist movement , 6-24-2025

NEW YORK --- Zohran [[Mamdani]{.underline}]{.mark} has surged so much in
his upstart New York City mayoral campaign, he stands to win one of the
biggest political prizes in America. With that [[victory comes a major
test for]{.mark} his [socialist movement.]{.mark}]{.underline}

**[[Mamdani]{.underline}]{.mark}** still trails Andrew Cuomo in most
polls but has significantly closed the gap heading into Tuesday's
Democratic primary. A [[win would]{.underline}]{.mark} shock the
Democratic Party, as it grapples with its national 2024 losses, and
[[i**nspire like-minded lefties to** challenge establishment
figures.]{.underline}]{.mark}

It would also shine a spotlight on Mamdani and the Democratic Socialists
of America, forcing them to answer one of the most pressing questions of
their movement[: Can leftist ideologues effectively govern a major
metropolis?]{.underline}

As mayor, Mamdani would wield power over a \$115 billion budget and more
than 300,000 employees, run the nation's largest police force and
immediately be tasked with plowing snow and filling potholes. He would
also occupy the greatest bully pulpit in the economic capital of the
world's largest economy, something he highlighted as the chief role of a
mayor in a recent interview. That split, which at times [frustrated Bill
de Blasio when he became
mayor](https://www.nydailynews.com/2015/10/01/nyc-needs-a-pothole-mayor/),
represents the tension between extreme ideology and mundane municipal
tasks.

"[[It would be **seismic**]{.underline}]{.mark}," said Grace Mausser,
co-chair of the city's chapter of the DSA, which plays a key role in
Mamdani's bid. "[[Having]{.mark} the [largest city in]{.mark} the
[country]{.mark} [have a socialist mayor]{.mark} [would send an
**extremely powerful** and hopefully **empowering** message to]{.mark}
**other [socialists and politicians]{.mark} and groups**]{.underline}
fighting for working class interests [[**across the
country**.]{.underline}"]{.mark}

A New York City mayor, one of the most complicated executive jobs in the
country, also demands a high degree of political compromise.

#### Socialism popularity is increasing 

**Peoples Dispatch,23**, is an international media project with the
mission of reporting on people\'s movements and organizations across the
globe., \"Socialism is increasingly popular in the US. So the House of
Representatives denounces it : Peoples Dispatch\", 2-4-2023
https://peoplesdispatch.org/2023/02/04/socialism-is-increasingly-popular-in-the-us-so-the-house-of-representatives-denounces-it/,

On Thursday, February 2, the United States House of Representatives
passed a resolution denouncing "the horrors of socialism." All 219
members of the Republican party voted in favor. Most Democrats did as
well, with 109 voting with the Republicans, 86 voting against, and 14
voting "present," which is effectively an abstention.

At a time when [[socialism is becoming increasingly popular in]{.mark}
the [US]{.mark}]{.underline} despite decades of red-baiting and
persecution of the left, the House denounced "socialism in all its
forms" and further opposed "the implementation of socialist policies in
the United States of America."

The [resolution repeated widely-debunked allegations of mass murder in
socialist countries]{.underline} and accused the revolutionary processes
in Cuba and Venezuela of causing great economic harm to the people while
[remaining silent on the impact of US sanctions which have been the
primary reason for the hardships faced by people in these
countries]{.underline}.

"The United States of America was founded on the belief in the sanctity
of the individual, to which the collectivistic system of socialism in
all of its forms is fundamentally and necessarily opposed," reads the
text.

The resolution was sponsored by Cuban-American representative ​​Maria
Elvira Salazar of Miami-Dade County. The resolution is now on its way to
the Senate.

This resolution also comes at a time when [[socialism]{.mark} as an
ideology [has been gaining popularity]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the [past few
years]{.mark}, [while support for]{.mark} the [capitalist]{.mark} system
[is decreasing]{.mark} in popularity]{.underline}. Even among
[Republicans and Republican-learners aged 18-34, an
Axios [poll](https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/axios-capitalism-update/) showed
that [from 2019 to 2021]{.mark}, [capitalism has dropped in popularity
from 81% to 66%.]{.mark} The [percentage of US adults]{.mark} overall
[with]{.mark} [favorable views of
socialism]{.mark} [[increased](https://www.axios.com/2021/06/25/americas-continued-move-toward-socialism) from
39% to 41%]{.mark} in that same time period]{.underline}

Among the 86 Democrats who voted against the resolution are progressives
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, and Cori Bush, who were all
endorsed by the Democratic Socialists of America, a large socialist
organization in the US. Ilhan Omar, Democratic Representative from
Minnesota, also voted against the resolution. Omar was recently voted
out of the House Foreign Affairs Committee by the Republican House
majority, due to her previous [anti-imperialist and anti-Zionist
statements](https://jacobin.com/2023/02/ilhan-omar-expulsion-house-foreign-affairs-committee-us-foreign-policy).

This resolution [[comes at]{.mark} a [time of crisis]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} the [working class]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[34
million]{.underline}]{.mark} people, including nine million children,
[[are food insecure]{.underline}]{.mark} in the United States. According
to the Poor People's Campaign,[ [[almost
half]{.mark}](https://www.poorpeoplescampaign.org/140-million-maps/) of
people [in the US are poor or]{.mark}]{.underline} have [[low
incomes]{.underline}]{.mark}. After a devastating global pandemic, which
led to over one million deaths in the US and generated a national
recession, the people of the United States were hit by a record-breaking
wave of inflation in 2022. In response to this, the Federal Reserve is
pushing to [slow wage
growth](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2023/1/19/23550856/wage-growth-inflation-federal-reserve),
claiming that this will help alleviate the inflation crisis. This is
while [[rents]{.mark} across the country [are skyrocketing]{.mark}, and
over 40% of tenants are spending more than 30% of their income on
rent.]{.underline}

"I think it's very telling of how threatened establishment
[[politicians]{.mark} are somehow l[osing their footing]{.mark}, losing
their power]{.underline}, really, [[where]{.underline}]{.mark} [[they're
positioning themselves]{.mark} [to]{.mark} utterly [defend a capitalist
system]{.mark} [that]{.mark} we see [has only caused
problems]{.mark},"]{.underline} Karla Reyes, union leader and socialist
organizer in New York City, told Peoples Dispatch. "\[This is\] In
contrast to what they could be focusing on, which is the crises that are
afflicting the working class in the United States, which include
homelessness, and [killer
cops](https://peoplesdispatch.org/2023/01/31/protesters-across-the-united-states-rage-against-the-police-killing-of-tyre-nichols/) who
are still murdering Black people with complete impunity."

"\[The House is\] trying to perpetuate an ideology that, frankly, is
getting old," said Reyes. "Capitalism has looted countries, has poisoned
the world, and has created unsustainable lifestyles that push us toward
individualism and toward consumerism...socialism is the complete
opposite."

[[**Socialism** is]{.underline}]{.mark} often defined as [a
**[negation]{.mark}** of or [an **alternative** to
**cap**]{.mark}**italism**]{.underline}---modern industrial capitalism
being the historical context in which socialism first rose to
prominence. This first, negative [**characterization** of
socialism]{.underline} leaves much open, and it may be too inclusive on
its own. To get closer to a definition, one must say more about how
[socialists]{.underline} understand and [**oppose**
capitalism]{.underline}.

Marxists often speak of [socialism and capitalism as
**[different]{.mark}** "modes of **[production]{.mark}**" or different
ways of **[organizing]{.mark}** society's [economic
activity]{.mark}]{.underline}. Erik Olin Wright (2010, p. 34) proposed
understanding capitalism as characterized by two features. The first is
a particular kind of [**class relations** between capitalists who
**own** the means of production and **workers** who do **not** and are
**employed** by capitalists]{.underline}. By "means of production,"
socialists typically mean tools, machinery, buildings, and raw materials
(Cohen, 1978, p. 55). The second [**characteristic** is its central
mechanism of **economic coordination**]{.underline}---the so-called
[**[market]{.mark}** coordination]{.underline} through decentralized
exchanges, [[coordinated by]{.mark} the "**[invisible
hand]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (Wright, 2010, pp. 34--35). A third feature
of capitalism often emphasized by socialists is that workers are the
owners of their own labor power, something which distinguishes
capitalism from other class-based modes of production such as feudalism
or slavery (Marx, 1996, pp. 178--180, 749).

The first of these characteristics of [capitalism]{.underline} points
toward and [[**clearly contrasts** with]{.underline}]{.mark} one of the
most common definitions of [socialism, namely **[common
ownership]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the means of production. Several
proponents, observers, and critics of socialism have converged around
this clear and simple economic or "materialist" way of defining
socialism. For instance, in the Manifesto, Marx and Engels said that
"the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence:
Abolition of private property" (Marx & Engels, 1976a, p. 498), and Marx
contrasted capitalism with a situation in which "the material conditions
of production are the cooperative property of workers themselves" (Marx,
1989, p. 88). John Stuart Mill noted that socialism involves "joint
ownership by all the members of the community of the instruments and
means of production" (Mill, 1967, p. 738), and one of socialism's
staunchest critics, Ludwig von Mises, defined [**socialism** as "the
**socialization** of the means of **production**]{.underline}" (Von
Mises, 1981, p. 10). Gilabert and O'Neill (2019, Section 1) have
proposed the following minimal condition on a socialist society: "The
bulk of the [means of **[production]{.mark}** is [under **social**,
**democratic** control]{.mark}]{.underline}." This condition is related
to the classic definition but is somewhat less restrictive, as the
qualifier "bulk of" allows that some means of production may be in
private hands, and the notion "social, democratic control" allows for
some more leeway with respect to more forms of organization than just
collective ownership. Thus, a market socialist economy with
democratically controlled firms may count as socialist on this
definition, whereas a [**[typical]{.mark}** social--democratic
**[market]{.mark}** economy [with]{.mark} mostly **[private]{.mark}**
ownership]{.underline}, but significant redistributive policies, still
[[falls **outside**]{.mark} it]{.underline}.

Against Schweickart's view, we can conclude that [an [**economy** is
**not** a]{.mark} kind of **[salad]{.mark}** made of elements [that can
be **combined**]{.mark} at will]{.underline}. [Capitalism and communism
respond to [**antagonistic** principles of]{.mark} operation and
economic **[organization]{.mark}** --- like the [**market** and
**planning**]{.mark} --- which seek to [**exclude** each other]{.mark}
in order to **effectively** deploy their respective
**potentialities**]{.underline}. Planning and markets are [[not
**neutral** "instruments]{.mark}" of allocation that can be "[used"
**across**]{.mark} different social settings [but]{.mark} rather
**institutional** [expressions of **distinct**]{.mark} social
[structures]{.mark}]{.underline}. Obviously, there will never be pure
capitalism (markets) or communism (planning), since these will always
materialize in a symbiotic or conflictive relationship with other
economic and institutional elements that are alien to each, giving rise
to different configurations of these two systems. But that is one thing;
it is quite another to assume that a complex economy does not
necessarily rest on a certain logic or basic articulating principle, if,
as one must assume, it aspires to be viable and effective.

**Nieto '22** \[Maxi; January; Professor and Researcher of
Macroeconomics at Miguel Hernández University; Science and Society,

5.1. The impossibility of social control of production. The axis of our
[**critique** of market socialism is that **[any market]{.mark}**-based
[economy]{.mark}]{.underline}, founded on the autonomous initiative of
companies, will be [[**incompatible** with]{.mark} the conscious,
rational, and [**democratic** regulation]{.mark} of
activity]{.underline}. The fragmentation of the productive apparatus
into rival companies implies both that the decision-making process be
atomized and that the [**[surplus]{.mark}** be [kept in **private**
hands]{.mark}, which **prevents**]{.underline} the direction of
[**economic** development according to the **free will** of
citizens]{.underline}. [[As long as **markets
subsist**]{.underline}]{.mark} as a general structure of pro- duction
and investment, [the [logic of **capital** will
**govern**]{.mark}]{.underline}, so that the economic process will
necessarily operate under spontaneous and automatic conditions,
regulated by its own internal need for reproduction (equal to the needs
of capital and not those of the popula- tion). In this context,
[**[public]{.mark}** intervention will **inevitably** have only a [very
**limited effect**]{.mark}]{.underline} and will be unable to develop
far beyond what exists in contemporary economies.

#### The perm's '[success]{.underline}' destroys the alt.

**Kotz '25** \[David; April 21; Professor Emeritus, Economics,
University of Massachusetts Amherst, PhD, Economics, Berkeley; Socialism
for Today: Escaping the Cruelties of Capitalism, "Lessons from the Past
for a Socialist Future," Ch. 4\]

The above [examples also illustrate the role of
**ideology**]{.underline} in the process of attempted transitions to
market socialism. There are two sides to this process. First, the
[**[dominant]{.mark}** economic ideas]{.underline} in the capitalist
world -- that is, [**[neoclassical economic]{.mark}**
thought]{.underline} -- can [**[influence]{.mark}** intellectuals in
**[socialist]{.mark}**]{.underline} countries. The Soviet case
illustrated that process, as large numbers of Soviet intellectuals, and
particularly economists, rapidly shifted from a belief in a planned
economy and public ownership to an equally strongly held new belief in
free markets and private property. [This can **[propel]{.mark}** a move
[to]{.mark}ward **[market socialism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However, the
[**[underlying]{.mark}** new beliefs]{.underline} of influential
intellectuals do not stop there but [are really an **[advocacy]{.mark}**
for [replacing **socialism** with cap]{.mark}italism]{.underline}.26

The other side of the role of ideology is the [tendency of [**market**
relations]{.mark} to produce and **[reinforce]{.mark}** a belief in
**market [ideology]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In a society organized around
market relations, [[those who **succeed** in]{.mark} the [market]{.mark}
tend to [credit]{.mark} their [**success** to]{.mark} their **[own
virtues]{.mark}**]{.underline} and believe they are [thereby entitled to
**keep** the revenue]{.underline} that flows to them. [[Those who do
**not succeed**]{.mark} tend to [think]{.mark} it is their **[own
fault]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Thus, [**market** allocation tends to
appear fair and **just**]{.underline}. As market relations expanded in
China in the 1980s, it promoted a belief in neoclassical ideas.
Neoclassical ideology, which claims that market allocation can work
effectively only with private ownership, provided a handy justification
for those who were growing rich through market activity to be allowed to
own an enterprise.

The examples of market socialism discussed above all involved evolution
from the Soviet model. Would the tendency for a market socialism that
emerges in a Soviet-model country to lead to a transition to capitalism
also apply to a market socialist system born out of capitalism? [[Any
**market socialist**]{.mark} system]{.underline}, regardless of its
origins, [would produce a **wealthy** class]{.underline} of those who
succeed in market activity. The new rich, aspiring to multiply their
wealth through ownership of productive property, would [[pose a
**threat**]{.mark} to a **socialist** system]{.underline}. Also,
[**market** relations]{.underline} have a powerful tendency to operate,
not as an innocent allocator of resources, but as [a **socializer** that
teaches individualism]{.underline}, pursuit of narrow self-interest,
[and a **drive** to rise above others]{.underline}.

### Framework\-\--Absolution\-\--2AC

#### Evaluate the impacts of the 1AC -- it's the only value-neutral way to determine the desirability of the plan. Otherwise, moral absolution.

This example helps illustrate my main argument: [if your moral beliefs
are correct, then you should be morally absolutist. However, **[policy
absolutism is problematic]{.mark}**, because [it can]{.mark} actually
[undermine]{.mark} our [progress towards]{.mark} whatever moral
[goods]{.mark} that we believe [we should pursue]{.mark}. Whenever we
come to the realization that the policies we support will undermine our
moral goals[, we should have no aversion to]{.mark} [**changing our
opinions** about]{.mark} the [policies]{.mark} that we
support.]{.underline} The obvious implication of this argument for the
public sphere is that we should not only be open to changing our own
opinions, but that we should also be open to other people changing their
opinions. While it may seem obvious that we should be willing to change
our opinions in response to new data or studies[, [the political world
prizes consistency]{.mark} [over evidence,]{.mark} and [people]{.mark}
**[who change their opinions are perceived as
"unprincipled]{.mark}**."]{.underline} For example, in the 2012
presidential election, [Mitt Romney was criticized for having frequently
changed his political positions on issues such as
healthcare.]{.underline} I don't want to speculate as to the reasons for
which Romney changed his opinions as he did, [but if he changed them
because the facts led him to realize that the policies he initially
supported were not the best ways to accomplish his moral goals, then he
should have both changed his positions and been applauded for doing
so]{.underline}.

The fact that political absolutism should give way to empirical analysis
has serious implications[[. When]{.mark} [people]{.mark} [develop their
opinions]{.mark} on a political issue, [they]{.mark} tend to
[use]{.mark} [sources that]{.mark} will [confirm what they]{.mark}
[already believed]{.mark}: those on the left get their information on
economics from Paul Krugman,]{.underline} while those on the right get
theirs from John Taylor. But ultimately, both Krugman and Taylor are
empirical economists, and we should have no aversion to consulting the
research of either when done honestly and well. [Rather, [we
should]{.mark} seek to [be **value-neutral** in]{.mark} the process of
[researching]{.mark} on [a]{.mark}ny given [political]{.mark}
[issue]{.mark}, with no pre-ordained opinions on what the facts are.
Certainly, we can choose to weigh certain facts and findings differently
in accordance with our values: an environmentalist evaluating fracking
can intentionally discount the jobs created by the practice and place a
higher value instead on environmental protection. However**, [it is
unreasonable]{.mark} is [to deny what]{.mark}** the [facts are]{.mark}
in order [to confirm]{.mark} [what we]{.mark} already [believe]{.mark}:
if fracking creates jobs, it would be unreasonably absolutist for an
environmentalist to deny that this is the case.]{.underline} What would
be yet more unreasonable would be for the environmentalist to oppose
fracking if it were the case that fracking actually protected the
environment in the long run, relatively speaking, because natural gas
burns off half as much carbon dioxide as coal (though of course, whether
or not fracking reduces pollution in the long run is an empirical
question). [[To cling to a **pre-ordained opinion**]{.mark} on what the
facts [are behind]{.mark} any [political issue]{.mark} [is]{.mark} to be
[policy-absolutist]{.mark}, and, as this threatens moral goals, it ought
to be avoided.]{.underline}

### Cap Inevitable\-\--2AC

Philosophy; The Collector; \"Mark Fisher's Capitalist Realism: Is
Capitalism Inevitable?\";
https://www.thecollector.com/mark-fisher-capitalism-capitalist-realism/\]

In a 1980 speech, Margaret Thatcher would come up with a phrase which
was to become the cornerstone of neoliberal ideology "There's no such
thing as society". In 1979, 13.6% of the British population lived with
below 60% of median incomes. By 1990, that number would rise up to 22.2
%. Union membership shrunk from 13.2 million people to 9.8 by the time
Thatcher was out of office. The largest miner strike was ruthlessly
crushed. Inequality soared, reaching levels unimaginable since after
WW2. How could this be justified? Simple: Free market capitalism was
presented as having no alternatives.

[[**Capitalism is here to stay**, and any inequality and poverty that
result are just the cost of doing business]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
Keynesian dream of a mixed economy had ended. Any other alternative
system was seen as either naïve, utopic or both. It is with the start of
neoliberal era where we see the emergence of what the late Mark Fisher
calls ["Capitalist realism": the notion that [capitalism is the only
viable way of organizing a society.]{.mark} Anything else becomes simply
unimaginable.]{.underline}

Mark Fisher and Capitalist Realism: Catastrophe Strikes

In the collective imagination, the end of the world -- also known as the
apocalypse -- is imagined as a singular event, as a nuclear explosion,
as an asteroid hitting the earth, as a mysterious disease spreading like
wildfire, as an alien civilization wiping us from the face of the earth,
as a "bang". It is certainly not imagined the way we're living through
it now.

Earlier this year, a climate activist set himself on fire at the Supreme
court to protest the lack of reaction to the climate crisis. Barely any
of the publications seemed to focus on the reason why, however. David
Buckel, a lawyer and an environmental activist, had done the same thing
in 2018, writing in his suicide letter:

"Here is a hope that giving a life might bring some attention to the
need for expanded action."

No action seems to have been taken since then, at least nothing
substantial. After taking a short break during the pandemic, CO2
emissions are on track to reach their record high levels again -- a
record that was previously set in 2019.. We've known about climate
change at least since the early 60s, we know where we're headed if we
keep this up, yet this disaster seems impossible to stop. Why?

Mark Fisher and Green Capitalism

[[The problem of climate catastrophe]{.mark}]{.underline} is one which
[[goes straight to]{.mark} the heart of [capitalist
realism]{.mark}]{.underline}. If you search you'll find plenty of
"solutions" to climate change and you'll find that all these solutions
do not seem to take into account [the kernel of the problem which is
that [capitalism always needs to expand,]{.mark} [we need to consume
more, companies need to earn more than last month and GDP needs to keep
going up]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[A [capitalist economy with no growth hits a recession]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} a c[apitalist economy with growth hits the finite
boundaries]{.mark} of our planet.]{.underline} [[No matter what]{.mark}
awesome, cool, green [solutions are invented]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
future, **[[capitalism's growth imperative will still be
there]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Rarely any "solutions" seem to be able to
name capitalism as the problem of growth. Growth is treated as a fact of
nature; it is taken for granted. **[[All we can do is manage the
consequences.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Mark Fisher, however, sees political potential in the climate crisis. It
is a crack which threatens to expose capitalist realism for what it is,
not a necessary state of reality at all but a collective delusion which
has convinced us we can keep the structures of capital accumulation
intact and solve the crisis at the same time. This delusion has
convinced us that we can solve what was caused by capitalism and
technological exploitation with yet more capitalism and technological
exploitation of the planet.

Futurist Capitalism

Fisher tells us that [[we're living through the end of the world. It
doesn't end with a bang. It unravels slowly, the world degrades, systems
fall apart]{.underline}]{.mark}. Fisher's reading of the movie "Children
of Men" provides an analogy to what we're living through.

In "Children of Men", people with the traditional capacity to give birth
have become sterile. The youngest person in the world is pronounced dead
at the start of the movie. The new can no longer be born. Fisher asks,
how long can a culture persist without the new? We see this in our own
music, fashion, architecture. Our cultural obsession with "retro" or
"vintage" speaks to a deep cultural impotence, an inability to create a
new authentic act.

[We're stuck on a cultural loop]{.underline} based on movie reruns,
adaptations, and franchises. Time has forgotten to move forward. Even
wild futuristic dreams aren't new at all. They're simply an extension of
the same into the future and into the stars. [[Capitalist realism haunts
the imagined future]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Murray Bookchin puts in a
1979 speech:

"So, a lot of people are walking around today who sound very idealistic.
And what do they want to do? They want multinational corporations to
become multi-cosmic corporations \[laughter from the
audience\]---literally! ..Most futurists start out with the idea, 'you
got a shopping mall, what do you do then?' Well, the first question to
be asked is, 'why the hell do you have a shopping mall?' \[laughter\]
That is the real question that has to be asked."

[[Capitalism is preserved even in our wildest futuristic
dreams]{.underline}]{.mark}. It has infected our collective imagination
to such a degree that [we literally cannot imagine a world without
it]{.underline} even 300 or 1000 years from now. [[We're on Mars, we're
traveling through a black hole, we're teleporting through space but
we're still imagining that all of this happens under a capitalist
economy.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Capitalism is so dominant that it has invaded the horizons of what is
thinkable]{.underline}]{.mark}. Capitalist realism for Fisher is not
realism in the classical sense but rather fatalism or cynicism, the
thought that "[t**[his is as]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[good as it
gets]{.underline}]{.mark}**". To hope for more is naive. "Get real"
attitudes are imposed onto anyone who hopes for something better.

[Capitalism has seeped into our unconscious]{.underline}; it even
colonizes our dreams. [Capitalist realism is "a kind of invisible
barrier constraining thought and action".]{.underline} We find it
difficult to think beyond it. Even those **[[critiques of
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}** we see in the media [**[do not]{.mark}
seem to be [do]{.mark}ing [any damage at all. ]{.mark}**[They're easily
absorbed into its logic of consumption and]{.mark} even **[help perform
anti-capitalism on our behalf, so we don't have
to]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

The current order is naturalized. It isn't experienced as a particular
order or system at all. It's just how life is. Jordan Peterson, a famous
self-help guru and psychologist, has the rule "Abandon ideology" listed
as number 6 of his "12 More Rules for Life" book (turned out the first
12 didn't quite suffice). This implies that ideology is like a pair of
glasses that distort your view of reality, something you can take off at
any time and see the world for "what it really is".

[There is nothing more ideological than thinking that you've gone beyond
ideology]{.underline}. Ideology isn't a dogma or a lie which can be
dispelled. [Ideology is the shared fantasy]{.underline} which shapes
social reality itself and draws its experiential boundaries. Capitalist
realism represents the most sophisticated form of ideology. If we see
soviet propaganda now and can easily see through the lies and
manipulation that were going on, in capitalism this is far more
difficult to articulate.

#### Even leading Marxist, David Harvey, agrees

**Ellner \'20** \[Steve; July 15; retired professor from Venezuela's
Universidad de Oriente, currently an Associate Managing Editor of Latin
American Perspectives; Canadian Dimension; \"David Harvey's new thesis
is that 'capitalism is too big to fail.' Is it?\";
https://canadiandimension.com/articles/view/david-harveys-new-thesis-is-that-capitalism-is-too-big-to-fail-is-it\]

Up until now, [[famed geographer David Harvey]{.mark} has been
[considered a leading Marxist]{.mark}]{.underline}, even if some on the
left have criticized several of his theories as "reformist." In my
opinion, Harvey's contributions to Marxist thinking, with regard to both
his theoretical formulations and efforts to make Marxism accessible to
large numbers of people, are undeniable. All the more reason to be
disappointed by his recent thesis.

In a video lecture in his series "Anti-Capitalist Chronicles," [[Harvey
cautions against the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism]{.mark} on
the grounds that [such a strategy is outmoded]{.mark}]{.underline}. His
central argument is that **[[capitalism is "too big to
fail]{.mark}"]{.underline}** and thus **[[the best we can hope for are
incremental reforms to prop up]{.mark} [the
system]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Since capitalism is too big to fail,
Harvey argues, **[it is necessary that we not allow it to
fail:]{.underline}** "We have to actually spend some time propping it
\[capitalism\] up, trying to reorganize it, and maybe shift it around
very slowly and over time to a different configuration. But [[a
revolutionary overthrow]{.mark} of this capitalist economic system is
not anything that's conceivable at the present time. **It [will not
happen,]{.mark} and it [cannot happen, and we have to make sure that it
does not happen."]{.mark}**]{.underline}

One of Harvey's arguments on the [[need to tame capitalism rather than
replace it]{.underline}]{.mark} is that [[perilous]{.mark} [internecine
conflict worldwide has to be avoided at all cost]{.mark}.]{.underline}
He calls on the left to try "[to manage this capitalist system in such a
way that we stop it being too monstrous to survive at the same time as
we organize the capitalist system so that it becomes less and less
dependent upon profitability]{.underline} ... so that the world's
population can reproduce in peace and tranquility, rather than the way
it's going right now, which is not peace and tranquility at all, but
eruptions. And these eruptions can, of course, also lead to conflicts
between different parts of the world, and geopolitical conflicts, and
the like."

#### Capitalism isn't inherently flawed or the root cause of all our problems -- it just requires direction and reform to solve

**Boushey 19** \[Heather; 6-5; American Institute President; Brookings;
\"Capitalism used to promise a better future. Can it still do that?\";
https://www.brookings.edu/articles/capitalism-used-to-promise-a-better-future-can-it-still-do-that/\]

[[The question is whether capitalism can be part of the solution rather
than part of the problem]{.underline}]{.mark}; or whether some form of
deep-green socialism is the only answer. [[On the historical
record]{.mark}, [the socialist]{.mark} [approach has little to
commend]{.mark} it. [Lake Baikal]{.mark}, [the world's largest
freshwater lake]{.mark}, in the former Soviet Union, [was trashed by
pollution]{.mark}, absorbing more than 15,000 metric tons of toxic
waste]{.underline}. It's true that the market does not value
environmental resources (any more than Soviet-style socialism); but that
is not the fault of the market, but of politicians. [[**Capitalism
doesn't care about the climate crisis, but it is not supposed to.**
Blaming capitalism for climate change is like blaming distilleries for
drunk driving.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[The Great Lakes are not protected from pollution because American
capitalists read Silent Spring and decided to put planet before profits.
If they are relatively clean today, that's because the government
protected them, on behalf of the people. [Market]{.mark}]{.underline}
forces are always being shaped, for good or ill, by politics. And they
[[could be shaped]{.mark} here [by introducing a carbon
tax]{.mark}]{.underline}, set high enough to strongly alter economic
behavior. [[Most economists favor a carbon tax: a recent
statement]{.mark} in support [garnered 3,500]{.mark} [distinguished
signatures]{.mark}, including [four former chairs of the Federal
Reserve]{.mark}, [27 Nobel]{.mark} Laureate [economists]{.mark} and [15
former chairs of the Council of Economic Advisers]{.mark}]{.underline}.

On three fronts, then, [[the promise of a better future,]{.mark} which
[lies at the heart of capitalist psychology and
theory]{.mark}]{.underline}, is being challenged. The question is
whether that promise can be restored within a capitalist framework --
with, say, wage insurance, redistribution and a carbon tax -- or whether
the system itself comes into question.

Even some of capitalism's friends have given economic growth a shelf
life, seeing it as a necessary phase in economic history in order to
overcome material deprivation, but unnecessary and possibly harmful once
that milestone has been passed. John Stuart Mill, in 1848, argued that
it was "only in the backward countries of the world that increased
production is still an important object. In those most advanced, what is
economically needed is a better distribution." John Maynard Keynes, in
his famous essay 1930 essay Economic Possibilities for our
Grandchildren, predicted that within a century the economic problem
would be "solved" -- in other words that all reasonable material wants
would have been met. Eleven years to go, everybody!

There are three problems with the idea that economic growth has a
sell-by date. First, nobody has a good way of deciding exactly when
enough is enough, since our ideas of material sufficiency change too.
Air conditioning was once considered by most Americans to be a "luxury".
Today it is seen as a necessity: 86% of American households have AC. So
who's right? Mill could not imagine the motor cars of Keynes's era.
Keynes could not imagine the personal computers used by JK Galbraith.
Galbraith could not imagine the laptop on which I am writing this,
connected to wifi, on a plane crossing the Atlantic. And so on. The
whole point of capitalist growth is that it doesn't have an end point.

Second, capitalism is intrinsically growth-oriented. Markets don't work
well in a stationary state; they are like sharks, either moving or dead.
Nobody has satisfactorily described a no-growth, market-based model.
Third, it is always elite thinkers deciding that enough is enough; when
many of their fellow citizens, looking up at them, might reasonably feel
differently.

It is now more than half a century since the Club of Rome published The
Limits to Growth and Fred Hirsch published the Social Limits to Growth.
The first argued that the depletion of natural resources would put the
brakes on economic progress; the latter that competition among the
affluent for positional goods (valuable precisely because of their
scarcity) would reduce overall welfare. While both predictions contained
important truths, neither have so far proved correct. Market-fueled
growth has slowed, certainly by comparison to the booming decades in the
middle of the last century, and has become more skewed towards the rich,
but it has not stalled.

[[The question now is not]{.mark},]{.underline} I think[, [whether and
how capitalism will end, but how it can renew its promise of a better
future -- for us all.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Capitalism has dominated for two centuries -- humanity is too embedded in societal structures for change to happen

**Bourne \'18** \[Ryan; June 11; R. Evan Scharf Chair for the Public
Understanding of Economics, Cato Institute; CATO Institute;
\"[[Capitalism's Critics Need to Be Told About Its 200 Years of
Success]{.underline}]{.mark}\";
https://www.cato.org/commentary/capitalisms-critics-need-be-told-about-its-200-years-success\]

Sometimes, there's nothing more controversial than a self-evident truth,
especially on Twitter.

Want to trigger a swarm of angry Corbynistas? Mention how [[capitalism
has greatly reduced material misery in the past 200
years]{.underline}]{.mark}. "If you honestly believe that, I actually
feel bad for you," one replied. Others mused that capitalism was
responsible for slavery, war, poverty, hunger, and inequality. All of
which would be news to anyone who has studied pre-19th century history.

Whether through ignorance or utopianism, lots of people forget [we live
in unprecedented prosperity.]{.underline} [[Poverty is not a product of
capitalism, but has been with mankind for all time]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The facts speak for themselves. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, most
people lived on about £2.20 per day, or £800 per year in today's money,
according to economic historian Deirdre McCloskey. In 2015, average
earnings for a full-time UK employee were £27,600.

But it's not just income. [[Capitalism has liberated us from]{.mark}
back-breaking [agricultural and domestic toil]{.mark}, [reducing average
hours worked]{.mark} considerably. [Crop yields have risen]{.mark}.
[Undernourishment has collapsed.]{.mark} [Access to electricity
has]{.mark} dramatically [increased]{.mark}. [Global average life
expectancy rose from 52.5 years in 1960 to 71.6 in 2015]{.mark}
alone.]{.underline}

[Yes, there are costs to development, including on the
environment]{.underline} (though these days wealthy countries are far
more environmentally friendly than poor). **[[But the idea capitalism
itself makes us sicker, more exploited and poorer is a historical
nonsense.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The Corbynistas implicitly admit as
much when they pivot to extolling how rich we are to justify ramping up
government spending.

As the American conservative commentator Jonah Goldberg explains in his
new book, Suicide of the West, [[the past 200-plus years have been a
"miracle" in the truest sense]{.mark} of the word.]{.underline} The
take-off in human flourishing is largely unexplained by conventional
economics, because lots of the components we take as partial
explanations --- trade, property rights, and technological advances ---
were found in previous societies, without the dramatic results. Both
Goldberg and McCloskey conclude that a combination of ideology and
rhetoric, including the elevation of individual liberty and innovation,
were critical factors that birthed the golden egg-laying goose.

The major problem is capitalism is unnatural. Human nature is
instinctively tribalistic, even socialistic. We've got rich not because
we are now free to act on our instincts, but because we developed a
system restraining them. But our innate, romantic tribal desires live
on. In an era in which civil society is weak, we put more demands on
politics to fulfil it, in turn blaming alien capitalistic institutions
for all ills. The result is fomenting across developed countries. On the
Left, through increasing identity politics, and resurgent socialism; on
the Right, burgeoning anti-immigrant feeling and nationalism; on both,
rabid partisanship and politics as a "team sport".

[[At best capitalism's critics are complacent that growth]{.mark} and
material prosperity [will go on forever,]{.mark} irrespective of how
much institutions and norms are corrupted. [At worst, they do not
care]{.mark}]{.underline}. But when shadow chancellor John McDonnell
states his desire to "overthrow capitalism" or substantially erode
property rights, or when Donald Trump singles out individual companies
or orders businesses to purchase energy from struggling suppliers, [[we
should worry about the longer-term consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}.
For just as we talked ourselves into the miracle, logic suggests we can
talk ourselves out of it.

That's not to say that all politics risks our economic inheritance.
There has and will always be a legitimate debate about how to assist the
poor, from classical liberalism to aggressively redistributive social
democracy. The former elevates freedom from government restraint as an
end, and the latter the so-called "positive" freedom that comes about
from state security. Importantly though, both champion the concept of
liberty, just in different manifestations.

But right now this settlement and these ideas are under attack, and
conservatives are failing to defend institutions worth actually
conserving. In the US, plenty of erstwhile conservatives embrace
nationalistic interest-group politics purporting to elevate "the people"
against elites. Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon even believes there is
a "dominant political force coming in American politics" with "elements
of Bernie Sanders coupled with the Trump movement". And this is logical.
A tribal politics based on "the nation" will inevitably lead to
socialism, because the only institution that can claim to act on behalf
of the whole nation is the national government.

Here, Priti Patel was right this week too to say the Conservative Party
is lazy in the battle of ideas. With the notable exception of the
redoubtable Liz Truss, few Conservatives extol the economic liberties
that underpin our prosperity. Even fewer express support for strong
families, civil society institutions and charities. Instead, faced with
resurgent socialism, the Conservatives sound apologetic about market
economics, and increasingly jettison personal responsibility in favour
of government curing "burning injustices".

[[Vacating the field in these debates though is a dangerous
game]{.mark}. Failure to express the miracle, why it happened and why it
must be defended gives capitalism's critics a free run.]{.underline} It
may well be that right now, the public's taste for high living
standards, fading memory of the Seventies decline, and appreciation of
failing regimes around the world checks the rise of British socialism.
[[But if the story we tell ourselves is that everything is disastrous,
then the overturning of existing institutions will
follow]{.underline}.]{.mark}

Former US president Ronald Reagan once said: "Freedom is a fragile thing
and is never more than one generation away from extinction." He may have
been exaggerating. But history suggests our prosperity is dependent on
ideas. And at the moment, **[a politics appealing to our base instincts
[risks turning allowing bad ideas to fruition.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### Change can occur from within the system -- prefer emperics

**IESE Insight 21** \[IESE Insight; 2021; Business School of the
University of Navarra; IESE Insight; \"The Future of Capitalism\";
<https://insightreports.iese.edu/en/the-future-of-capitalism-report/>\]

[[Can change occur within]{.mark} what we know of as modern
[capitalism,]{.mark} even at an international level[? There's evidence
that it can]{.mark}.]{.underline} For instance, in July 2021, [[130
countries and jurisdictions, representing more than **90% of global
GDP**, joined forces to establish a new framework for international
corporate tax reform.]{.mark}]{.underline} This will prevent
multinationals from shopping around to find the countries with the
lowest corporate tax rates and then registering themselves for tax
purposes there; instead, those multinationals will be taxed at a minimum
global profit tax rate of 15% not in their country of residence but in
their place of sale. In the words of French Finance Minister Bruno Le
Maire[, this will "[put an end to the race to the
bottom.]{.underline}]{.mark}" Big Tech multinationals that now allegedly
evade taxes (fingers point at Amazon and Facebook) are the most likely
to be affected[[. Governments can use the extra monies raised to fund
development goals.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Systemic changes can also include new measurements, **mindsets**,
responsibilities and a shift from a shareholder to a
stakeholder]{.underline}]{.mark} focus in businesses across borders. See
Global alternatives for a snapshot of how capitalism finds distinct
expressions around the world, to help expand your thinking beyond your

#### Capitalism is good -- public opinion proves

**Augustine \'23** \[Norman; June 13; Businessman and former United
States Under Secretary of the Army; Directors & Boards; \"Capitalism
Still Inspires Hope for the World's Citizens\";
https://www.directorsandboards.com/board-duties/corporate-purpose/capitalism-still-inspires-hope-for-the-worlds-citizens/\]

[[Capitalism]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} [has]{.underline}]{.mark}
regrettably [[become]{.mark} [a]{.mark}]{.underline} somewhat
[[pejorative term]{.underline}]{.mark} to many (explaining why I prefer
to refer to it as the free enterprise system), [**[has]{.mark}**
arguably **[done more to improve the quality of people's lives than any
other economic system in history]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Even the
People's Republic of China's tenuous experiment with a capitalist
economy managed to move more Chinese from poverty into the middle class
than there are Americans to move anywhere.

It didn't take long for America's early settlers to figure out the power
of capitalism. As John Smith wrote in Jamestown in the early 1600s,
"When our people were fed out of the common store, and laboured jointly
together, glad was he who could slip from his labour, or slumber over
his task, we care not how; nay, the most honest among them would hardly
take so much true pains in a week as now for themselves they will do in
a day..."

[[The essence of capitalism is motivation; that is, coupling
contribution with reward]{.underline}]{.mark}. Yet, this rather logical
approach has proved more difficult to implement than might be expected.
Consider the compensation of public-school teachers, which correlates
more closely with seniority than with teaching impact. The same goes for
civil service pay, which is quite flat within a given job category. In
the book Augustine's Laws, I sought to correlate CEO compensation with
company financial performance. Dismayingly, the so-called correlation
was basically a shotgun pattern. The resulting "Law VII" rather
apologetically states, "There are many highly successful businesses.
There are also many highly paid executives. The policy is not to
intermingle the two." Which is to say, all that sounds like capitalism
may not be capitalism.

But for capitalism to prosper also requires an element of oversight and
control. This includes making provisions for the less fortunate members
of society and ensuring that competition exists among suppliers. To be
effective, the latter demands regulation that is both clear and
consistently applied.

But herein lies the rub. While your writer most assuredly would not wish
to demean the integrity and dedication of the great majority of those
who serve in our government (I proudly devoted 10 years of my life as a
public servant), one must ask how the private sector can respond to
policies espoused by senior government officials when the average time
those policymakers remain in their jobs is barely two years --- after
which their policies often vanish with them. Worse yet, over halfway
through the current administration (and this is typical of most
administrations), about 700 of the 1,200 presidentially appointed
positions requiring Senate confirmation have not yet been filled. What
private sector firm would survive with such practices, and how can the
private sector and capitalism prosper on a playing field governed by
constantly changing rules and referees?

Sadly, free enterprise is further threatened throughout much of the
world by the rise of autocrats --- themselves prime exhibits of the
consequences of the absence of competition. Thus, confronted with both
internal and external threats, [[can true capitalism survive? The answer
is likely to be "yes," largely because of the inherent strengths of
capitalism itself]{.underline}]{.mark}. But even then, it can survive
only so long as freedom survives.

[Capitalism and freedom, the essence of America's great success, are
reflected in [surveys show]{.mark}ing [that when individuals]{.mark}
around the world [are asked in what country they would prefer to
live]{.mark} were they required to leave their home country[, 57%
answered the United States --- about 9% answered
China]{.mark}.]{.underline} My wife, an immigrant, describes America,
with its freedom and free enterprise system, as "the Land of Hope."

[[**Capitalism is preserved** even in]{.mark} our wildest **[futuristic
dreams]{.mark}**. It has [infected our collective imagination]{.mark} to
such a degree that [we literally **cannot imagine** a world without
it]{.mark} even 300 or 1000 years from now.]{.underline} We're on Mars,
we're traveling through a black hole, we're teleporting through space
but we're still imagining that [all of this happens under a

[[Capitalism is so dominant that it has invaded the horizons of **what

[is not realism in the classical sense]{.underline} but rather fatalism
or cynicism, the thought that "this is as good as it gets". To hope for
more is naive. "Get real" attitudes are imposed onto anyone who hopes
for something better.

[Capitalism has [seeped into our **unconscious**]{.mark}; it even

that distort your view of reality, something you can take off at any
time and see the world for "what it really is".

[There is nothing more ideological than thinking that you've gone
**beyond ideology**]{.underline}. Ideology isn't a dogma or a lie which
can be dispelled. Ideology is the shared fantasy which shapes social
reality itself and draws its experiential boundaries. [Capitalist

I. China and the Arctic

China is an important stakeholder in Arctic affairs. Geographically,
[[China is a "Near-Arctic State]{.mark}", one of the continental States
that are [close]{.mark}st [to the Arctic Circle]{.mark}.]{.underline}
The natural conditions of the Arctic and their changes have a direct
impact on China's climate system and ecological environment, and, in
turn, on its economic interests in agriculture, forestry, fishery,
marine industry and other sectors.

[**[China is]{.mark} also [closely involved]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the
trans-regional and global [issues in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline},
especially in such areas [as [climate]{.mark} change,
[environment,]{.mark} scientific [research]{.mark}, utilization of
[shipping routes, resource]{.mark} exploration and
[exploitation]{.mark}, security, and global governance]{.underline}.
These issues are vital to the existence and development of all countries
and humanity, and directly affect the interests of non-Arctic States
including China. [[China enjoys]{.mark} the freedom or rights of
scientific research, navigation, [overflight, **fishing**,]{.mark}
laying of submarine **[cables]{.mark}** and [**pipelines**, and]{.mark}
resource exploration and [**exploitation** in the]{.mark} high seas, the
Area and other relevant sea areas, and certain special areas in the
[Arctic Ocean]{.mark}, as stipulated in treaties such as the UNCLOS and
the Spitsbergen Treaty, and general international law.]{.underline} As a
permanent member of the UN Security Council, China shoulders the
important mission of jointly promoting peace and security in the Arctic.
[The utilization of sea routes and **[exploration and
development]{.mark}** of the resources in the Arctic [may have a huge
impact on the]{.mark} energy strategy and **[econ]{.mark}omic
[development]{.mark}** [of China]{.mark}, which is a major trading
nation and energy consumer in the world.]{.underline} China's capital,
technology, market, knowledge and experience is expected to play a major
role in expanding the network of shipping routes in the Arctic and
facilitating the economic and social progress of the coastal States
along the routes. China has shared interests with Arctic States and a
shared future with the rest of the world in the Arctic.

China has long been involved in Arctic affairs. In 1925, China joined
the Spitsbergen Treaty and started to participate in addressing the
Arctic affairs. Since then, China has exerted more efforts in the
exploration of the Arctic, expanding the scope of activities, gaining
more experience and deepening cooperation with other participants.
China's membership in the International Arctic Science Committee in 1996
marked its more active participation in scientific research in the
Arctic. Since 1999, China has organized a number of scientific
expeditions in the Arctic, with its research vessel Xue Long (Snow
Dragon) as the platform[. In 2004, [China **built** the **Arctic Yellow
River Station**]{.mark} in Ny Alesund in the Spitsbergen Archipelago. By
the end of 2017, China has [carried out eight]{.mark} scientific
[expeditions]{.mark} in the Arctic Ocean, [and **conducted**
research]{.mark} for 14 years with the Yellow River Station as the
base.]{.underline} Using its research vessel and stations as platforms,
China has gradually established a multi-discipline observation system
covering the sea, ice and snow, atmosphere, biological, and geological
system of the Arctic. The year 2005 saw China as the first Asian country
to host the Arctic Science Summit Week, a high-level conference on
Arctic affairs. In 2013, China became an accredited observer to the
Arctic Council. In recent years, Chinese companies have begun to explore
the commercial opportunities associated with Arctic shipping routes.
[China's [activities]{.mark} in the Arctic have gone beyond mere
scientific research, and [expanded into]{.mark} diverse areas of Arctic
affairs including the platforms of global [governance]{.mark}, regional
[cooperation]{.mark}, and bilateral and multilateral [affairs,
and]{.mark} such disciplines as [scientific research]{.mark}, ecological
environment, climate change, economic development, and cultural
exchanges]{.underline}. As an important member of the international
community, China has played a constructive role in the formulation of
Arctic-related international rules and the development of its governance
system. [The Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-century Maritime Silk
Road **([Belt and Road Initiative]{.mark}**), an important cooperation
initiative of China, [will bring opportunities]{.mark} for parties
concerned to jointly build a "Polar Silk Road]{.underline}", and
facilitate connectivity and sustainable economic and social development
of the Arctic.

[Arctic Policy 2035 identifies [a]{.mark} second [Russian Arctic
national interest]{.mark} with implications for the NSR:]{.underline}
[["development of the Arctic zone]{.mark} of the Russian Federation
**[as a strategic resource base]{.mark}** and its rational use with the
objective of accelerating economic growth of the Russian
Federation]{.underline} \[emphasis added\]."15 Russia's ability to
promote, foster, and exploit strategic natural resource development in
the Arctic is critical to the country's national security and economic
well-being. [[Russia's Arctic zone]{.mark} already [produces]{.mark} [10
percent of the]{.mark} country's **[g]{.mark}ross [d]{.mark}omestic
[p]{.mark}roduct** and 20 percent of its exports]{.underline}. 16 Led by
Arctic Policy 2035[, Moscow has clearly "enhanced the role of its Arctic
areas within both its domestic and foreign policy."]{.underline}17 For
example, this past February and just prior to releasing its new Arctic
policy, the Russian government renamed its Ministry for the Development
of the Russia Far East to the Ministry for the Development of the
Russian Far East and the Arctic.

[Russia's [ambitious plans to transform the Arctic into a]{.mark}
strategic resource [base and **economic engine** are]{.mark} [tempered
by]{.mark} the speed and duration of [ice melt]{.mark} in the Arctic
Ocean and particularly along the NSR.]{.underline} The faster the ice
melts throughout the Arctic, [presumably [the easier it becomes
to]{.mark} locate and [extract]{.mark} the region's [natural resources
and reap]{.mark} the [econ]{.mark}omic [benefits]{.mark}.]{.underline}
The rapidly warming Arctic also has significant negative consequences,
as recent events indicate. In June 2020, a fuel reservoir in Russia's
Siberia region collapsed, causing one of the worst oil spills ever
within the Arctic Circle. [Preliminary reports suggest melting
permafrost was the primary cause of the disaster.19 This occurred the
same month the Russian Siberian town of Verkhoyansk recorded a
temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit, an all-time high temperature in
the Arctic Circle. 20 Rapid warming in the polar north could

up.]{.mark}]{.underline}

If [business is to play a **leading role**, we need to have a **clear

business was not at all concerned -- and should not have to be -- with
what was sometimes called 'externalities' or 'external effects'. A
business is simply a money making machine for shareholders, to summarize
Friedman's view, it is only the law of the land that must put
constraints on individual businesses (but doesn't have to intervene in
the system as such -- the system itself cannot be questioned). In this

contribution to the surrounding world is then not the purpose of
business providing products or services. Rather, the purpose of business
is there, in a way. On that view, Paul Polman has summarized this as: "A
[business should]{.mark} not just [be]{.mark} profit-led, but
[**purpose-driven** and **profit-informed**]{.mark}**.**"]{.underline}

Of course, [businesses have to **make a living** and the means to do so
is indeed money]{.underline}. As the late Feike Sijbesma put it in one
of his lectures: "Profit is like oxygen, you need it to live, but it's
not the purpose of life." [[Applying **new technologies**]{.mark},
respecting **planetary boundaries**, [the **only long-term
strategy**]{.mark} is [to operate within the **ecological
context**]{.mark} in which we find ourselves]{.underline}. Sijbesma put
it well in the CSR lecture: "In the past 200 years we've created an
economic system that has had mode. Reading ocean temperature,
deforestation or plastic in the ocean. But we require a mindset change
as less bad is still bad. [To overcome an **exponential challenge**
leading companies increasingly apply **Net Positive** thinking and
**getting rewarded** for it]{.underline}."7 It is the positive
contribution that really counts, that really adds value.

[[Decades of **stagnation** and **financialization**]{.mark} have
[contributed to lagging investment]{.mark} in innovative segments of the
**productive economy**]{.underline}. Rather than stimulating productive
gains and cross-sectoral feedbacks, capitalist world dynamics currently
revolve around extracting unproductive value from the inflation of asset
prices (Adkins et al., 2020). Consequently, mission-oriented engagement
to rapidly introduce green infrastructures and sustainable modes of
production is low compared to previous technological revolutions.
Capital's profitability expectation is one reason for lagging investment
(Christophers, 2022a). Government's rather passive role is another.
Although the de-risking state utilizes green industrial policy to
identify 'strategic industrial sectors where it wants to promote capital
investment' (Gabor and Braun, 2023: 2), it primarily does so by tweaking
risk-return profiles in favor of capital interests. Moreover, the
implementation of quantifiable emission targets (e.g., a reduction of 45
percent by 2030), or the phasing out of polluting industries, is not on
the political agenda (Gabor and Braun, 2023). This is problematic
because markets themselves do not steer towards socially-needed end
results (Chomsky and Pollin, 2020). Central banks further encourage this
inertia by narrowly focusing on monetary stimulus and market neutrality,
while overlooking more interventionist measures, like a green fiscal
stimulus (Thiemann et al., 2023).

[If the current **de-risking economy** cannot provide the needed
infrastructure for green de-financialization[, a]{.mark}
state-orchestrated '[**mission economy'** becomes a desirable
alternative ]{.mark}]{.underline}(Mazzucato and Perez, 2023). Against
this background, we recommend a set of policy changes which radically
break with de-risking and market neutrality, and advocate for what Katie
Kedward et al. (2022) [call [an '**allocative green credit policy
regime'**.]{.mark} Instead of [using]{.mark} price signaling,
de-risking, and monetary dominance as the **principal decarbonization**
strategy]{.underline} (Thiemann et al., 2023), we call for a state-led
industrial policy [[**directing credit to** priority sectors and
reshaping market characteristics along]{.mark} de-[financialized, green
lines ]{.mark}]{.underline}(see also Lawrence, 2014). [[Much like
**green Keynesianism**]{.mark}, such an allocative credit policy is
therefore (i) [dictated by]{.mark} the **priorities** of [greening
(public) infrastructure]{.mark}, (ii) disciplining dirty sectors and
market-based finance, and (iii) involving **central banks** to play a
promotional (rather than prudential) role.]{.underline}

In the best-case scenario, [[this agenda of **green
de-financialization**]{.mark} is implemented at the supranational
level,]{.underline} where collaborating [[green states **collectively
reshape** financial markets around]{.mark} principles of public value
creation and [global sustainability ]{.mark}]{.underline}(Mazzucato and
Ryan-Collins, 2022). In doing so, [we see potential to dismantle
offshore financial networks,]{.underline} introduce new wealth taxes,
and redirect public and private resources from dirty or financial
sectors to investments in cleantech and renewables (Chomsky and Pollin,
2020). As the climate crisis worsens, [green states [can also
**discipline private capita**]{.mark}**l** by (i) introducing more
absolutist forms of state ownership, (ii) expropriating carbon assets,
and (iii) enforcing harder emission caps.]{.underline} Rather than
making green innovations 'investible' for private capital (Taggart and
Power, 2024), such green states thus intervene in the functioning of
markets while also allocate an increasing percentage of global GDP to
industrial policy favoring green infrastructures, resource efficiency
and climate mitigation (Chomsky and Pollin, 2020). Alternatively, when
fiscal regimes are tight, they can provide Public Sustainable Finance to
publicly controlled Climate- and Transformation funds and crowd in
private investment under mission-oriented guidelines (Golka et al.,
2024). Tax neutral innovation policy is another instrument to
incentivize green development. For example, a land value tax system
rewarding ecological innovation and labor, but penalizing pollution and
rent extraction from unimproved land, can shift economic decision-making
from pursuing quick and dirty profits to realizing sustainable and
intangible growth (Wijburg, 2025).

However, [[a 'Global]{.mark} Green New Deal'-like [approach **only
works** when **collaborating nation**]{.mark}**-states** [have the
capacity and **political willpower** to do so]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Therefore, [we acknowledge that [a **more pragmatic** stance]{.mark} on
the green, **de-financialization paradigm** [is also
needed]{.mark}]{.underline}, not least to forge complex institutional
compromises across economic sectors and stakeholders (Gabor and Braun,
2023). [Rather than merely risk-proofing private and institutional
investment, we propose a holistic 'sticks-and-carrots
approach']{.underline} where financial markets are both incentivized and
disciplined to finance green investments (Kedward et al., 2024). This
[[requires **greater coordination** between **monetary**, **fiscal**,
and **credit policy**]{.mark} so that every regulatory and planning tool
[within the state]{.mark} apparatus is [used to **change global market
directions**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Stephens and Sokol, 2023). For
example, while [[**green bonds**, **green investment** funds, and
**carbon offsetting** platforms]{.mark} have **[grown
exponentially]{.mark}**, we propose more aggressive forms]{.underline}
of 'green quantitative easing' [[to phase out asset purchases connected
to **carbon-led industries** and **tilt the market** into a **more
decisive**, **green direction**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Dafermos et al.,
2018). In addition, central banks could offer preferential interest
rates to renewable-led industries, while imposing higher capital
requirements and leverage ratios on lenders to polluting industries.
They could also mandate credit allocations to sectors that require
enhanced access to green capital. For example, a percentage share of
mortgage lending could be mandated into retrofitting programs (Kedward
et al., 2022), as well as a percentage of institutional investors'
portfolio holdings.

[[Capitalism]{.mark} has long been [a cornerstone of global
**econ**]{.mark}**omic [development]{.mark}**, driving
[progress]{.mark}, enhancing [efficiency, and]{.mark} opening doors to
[opportunities]{.mark}]{.underline}. At its core, capitalism thrives on
principles that encourage creativity, inspire competition, and fuel
sustainable growth. [By [understanding and upholding]{.mark} these
[principles]{.mark}, we [can]{.mark} harness its potential to
[address]{.mark} pressing global challenges while fostering a more
[inclusive **econ**]{.mark}**omic** **[landscape]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

1\. Encouraging Innovation

[[Innovation]{.mark} is the lifeblood of capitalism,
**[propel]{.mark}ling [society forward]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} new
ideas, products, and [tech]{.mark}nologies.]{.underline} The system
rewards those who dare to challenge the status quo, offering financial
incentives and market recognition for groundbreaking solutions. [From
the invention of the steam engine to the advent of artificial
intelligence, [cap]{.mark}italism has been instrumental in [driving
tech]{.mark}nological **[revolutions]{.mark}** that have improved lives
worldwide.]{.underline}

Why It Matters:

Encourages entrepreneurs to take risks.

Leads to breakthroughs in healthcare, energy, and communication.

Addresses societal challenges through market-driven solutions.

2\. Promoting Healthy Competition

[[Cap]{.mark}italism thrives on competition, pushing businesses to
improve their products, reduce costs, and better serve
consumers.]{.underline} This [dynamic [fosters]{.mark} a culture of
[excellence and adaptability]{.mark}]{.underline}, ensuring that only
the most efficient and innovative enterprises succeed. When competition
is fair and equitable, it drives progress and delivers better outcomes
for society.

Why It Matters:

Spurs productivity and efficiency.

Prevents monopolistic practices that stifle growth.

Provides consumers with diverse options and better value.

3\. Creating Economic Opportunity

[A well-functioning [capitalist system **generates opportunities**
for]{.mark} individuals and communities to improve their
[econ]{.mark}omic [well-being]{.mark}]{.underline}. It empowers people
by providing the tools and resources to build businesses, develop
skills, and achieve financial independence[. By fostering [private
ownership]{.mark} and entrepreneurial spirit, capitalism
[enables]{.mark} wealth creation and **upward
[mobility]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

Why It Matters:

[Reduces poverty by expanding access to jobs and markets]{.underline}.

Empowers individuals to achieve financial independence.

[Drives investment in education and infrastructure.]{.underline}

4\. Rewarding Merit and Efficiency

Capitalism rewards those who innovate, work hard, and efficiently
allocate resources. [This [merit-based]{.mark} [system
**incentivize**]{.mark}**s continuous
[improvement]{.mark}**,]{.underline} benefiting both businesses and
consumers. However, it is crucial to ensure that these rewards are
distributed equitably, fostering trust in the system and reducing
disparities.

Why It Matters:

Drives continuous improvement and higher standards.

[Aligns incentives with [productivity]{.mark} and value
creation.]{.underline}

Promotes accountability and performance.

5\. Global Collaboration and Market Expansion

In an increasingly interconnected world, [[cap]{.mark}italism
**[facilitates]{.mark} global [trade]{.mark}** [and
collaboration]{.mark}, breaking down barriers to exchange and fostering
cross-cultural partnerships.]{.underline} By opening up international
markets, businesses can access diverse talent pools, resources, and
consumers, driving mutual economic growth.

Why It Matters:

Enhances global economic integration.

Promotes shared prosperity through trade.

Encourages innovation through diverse perspectives.

Challenges and the Path Forward

[While capitalism has achieved remarkable feats, it is not without
challenges. Issues like income inequality, environmental degradation,
and market failures highlight the need for principles-based approaches
to ensure capitalism serves the greater good.]{.underline} Incorporating
ethical business practices, sustainable development goals, and inclusive
policies can align capitalism with long-term societal and environmental
objectives.

[By fostering innovation, promoting fair competition, and expanding
economic opportunities, [cap]{.mark}italism remains [a powerful driver
of **progress**]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, its true potential lies
in its ability to adapt and evolve---ensuring that its benefits are
shared widely and its impact is sustainable[. As we navigate the
complexities of a changing world, [principled **cap**]{.mark}**italism
[can]{.mark} lead the way in** [build]{.mark}ing a future of
[prosperity]{.mark}, resilience, [and **equity.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

But [more [recent data tells us]{.mark} a **slightly different
story.**]{.underline} A more hopeful story, that we can turn things
around. This is per-capita CO2 emissions in the UK since 1750. Over the
last few decades, [**[emissions]{.mark}** in the UK [have
**halved**]{.mark}.]{.underline} That means that my carbon footprint
today is less than half that of my grandparents\' when they were my age.
That\'s despite the fact I live a much more extravagant lifestyle, or,
as they\'d put it, \"You youngsters just don\'t know how good you\'ve
got it these days.\"

Now, you might think the UK\'s cheating here. It used to be this
industrial powerhouse, now it gets China, India and Bangladesh to
produce its stuff for it. [[Maybe it\'s just **offshored**]{.mark} all
these emissions]{.underline}. There\'s a bit of truth to this \-- [when
we adjust for trade, emissions in the UK are higher \-- but [we still
see]{.mark} this [**dramatic decline**]{.mark} over the last few
decades. [Offshoring]{.mark} is a bit of the story, but it\'s [not the
entire story]{.mark}.]{.underline} At the same time, the UK has
increased its GDP. [**[GDP]{.mark}** has [gone **up**,]{.mark} while
[**emissions** have come **down**]{.mark}.]{.underline} And it\'s not
the only country to achieve this. You will see the same for the US, for
Germany, France, Spain, Portugal. A long list of countries have
increased GDP while reducing their emissions. And again, [this is
[not]{.mark} just [because they\'ve offshored them]{.mark}. The [notion
that **economic growth**]{.mark} has to be [**in**compatible with
reducing]{.mark} our [environmental impact is **simply
wrong**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Now [rich countries are reducing their emissions]{.underline}, but low-
and middle-income countries are increasing theirs. What does this mean
at a global level? Well, [[total CO2 emissions]{.mark} are now
**[beginning to flatline]{.mark}**, but actually, emissions per person
**already peaked** a decade ago.]{.underline} That means the emissions
of the average person in the world today have peaked, [and [are **now
falling**]{.mark}.]{.underline} And we will see a peak in total CO2
emissions soon.

Now, why is this happening? [A [big driver]{.mark} has been
**[technological change]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Here, we see coal
production in the UK since 1700. Now the UK was the birthplace of
industrial coal, and it has now died there. When I was born, more than
half of the UK\'s electricity was coming from coal. This is now less
than two percent. And it's dying in many other countries too[. You will
see [the same for]{.mark} the [**US**, **Germany**, **Denmark**]{.mark},
Spain, Portugal, Greece, Ireland. In [many countries]{.mark} in the
world, [coal is dying. Taking its place]{.mark} are
**[renewables]{.mark}**, where **[costs are
plummeting]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The cost of solar has fallen by 99.8
percent since 1970, fallen by 90 percent in the last decade alone. And
if you\'re worried that it looks like this price trend is leveling off,
don\'t be. When we zoom in, we see that [the price of solar continues to
fall. And the same is true for wind.]{.underline} Go back a decade, and
solar and wind were among the most expensive energy technologies we had.
That is why the world was not making progress, that is why countries
were not deploying them \-- they were far too expensive. But just [ten
years on, and that script has flipped. In many countries in the world,
[**solar and wind** are now the **cheapest**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Now if we\'re going to have renewables, we\'re going to need energy
storage. But there\'s good news there too. The price of batteries has
fallen by 98 percent since 1990. If you take the battery you\'d find in
a Tesla today, go back to 1990, it would have cost one million dollars.
It now costs just 12,000. That's completely transformed the world of
energy storage and completely transformed the world of transport. Global
sales of petrol and diesel cars have already peaked \-- they peaked in
2017, and they are now falling. Taking their place are electric cars,
where, in a space of just a few years, sales are going through the roof.

And from energy and transport to the food we eat, you might imagine that
global deforestation is at its highest level ever. But actually,
[[**global deforestation** peaked **decades ago** ]{.mark}and is [now
falling]{.mark}]{.underline}. But actually, it\'s better than that,
because [many [countries are now **regrowing**]{.mark} their [old
forests]{.mark}, such that the net decline is even more
impressive.]{.underline}

Now, why is this happening? A big driver has been increases in crop
yields. For all of our agricultural history, crop yields were low and
stagnant. Farmers had basically no opportunities to increase them. Over
the last century, across many countries and many different crop types,
crop yields have skyrocketed. Here, we see it for the US, for corn,
where yields have grown sixfold, from two tonnes to 12 tonnes. Now what
this means is we can grow a lot more food from a lot less land. The
amount of land used to produce corn in the US has not increased in over
a century, but look at the change in corn production.

My main point here is that [in the past, human progress had to come at
the cost of the environment]{.underline}. If we wanted energy, we had to
burn wood or we had to burn fossil fuels. If we wanted to grow more
food, we had to expand farmland, often at the cost of forests. [But
[technology and innovation means we\'re **very quickly
decoupling**]{.mark} these impacts, such that [this conflict is **no
longer true**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### Sustainability\-\--AT: Financialization Bad\-\--1AR 

#### Reject their totalizing claims\-\--capitalism and financialization aren't inherently bad.

television commentator. Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer of

The [term [**'financialization'** has received **significant
attention**]{.mark} in recent year]{.underline}s and is seeing far
greater use in the vernacular of policymakers and thought leaders. [[The
term is used in **different ways**]{.mark} by different
parties,]{.underline} and a plethora of agendas exist behind these
discussions. What's clear is that there is growing interest in the role
of financial markets in the broader economy.

[While a treatment of financialization that embraces nuance is difficult
in our time, no treatment will be coherent without nuance.]{.underline}
The different uses, agendas, and contexts matter, and using vocabulary
to poison a well is easy to do in this discussion, and also
counterproductive. This essay explores the underlying concerns behind
financialization, and seeks to more accurately describe what market
forces do while addressing misconceptions about 'financialization' and
free markets.

Conscious effort is required to avoid the laziness embedded in the label
to paper over a class warfare argument. At the same time, advocates of
robust capital markets concede that financial activities exist that
offer limited productive value. In other words, it is entirely possible
(and, indeed, will be the position of this paper) that [what is [often
referred to as 'financialization' is no such thing at all,]{.mark} and
[is rather a **misguided attack** on **all capital
markets**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And yet, it is also entirely possible
(and the thesis of this essay) that a consortium of policies has
facilitated what can be called financialization, and these policies
should be rebuffed as contrary to the aim of a productive economy which
facilitates maximum opportunity for flourishing.

In this nuance, [we find [the **tragic irony** of this **contemporary
debate**]{.mark}. A growing movement, increasingly bipartisan,
[**hostile** to various activities]{.mark} in financial markets, has
[identified **the wrong target**]{.mark}**s** for critique.]{.underline}
In so doing [they not only [have **demonized healthy** and vital
**components**]{.mark} of an innovative economy but [have **missed the
culprits** who do warrant our attention]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
[[reasons]{.mark} for this misidentification of cause and effect [vary
from a **weak understanding** ]{.mark}of financial market reality
[to]{.mark} more severe **[ideologically driven
errors]{.mark}**.]{.underline} When the [critics of financialization
show a weak understanding of the problems]{.underline} they seek to
solve, [their **[proposed solution]{.mark}** can [only be **flawed**,
**incomplete**, and **misguided**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Activities
pejoratively referred to as financialization that are healthy and useful
need to be defended. Likewise, activities, policies, and incentives that
pollute the engines of a healthy economy need to be criticized. In
short, a lot is on the line in this contemporary discussion.

The first section of this paper seeks to define what financialization is
and what it is not. Upon establishment of a clear definition, analysis
is needed to determine what is negative and what is positive. Once
defined, an objective assessment of the causation of this phenomenon is
in order.

After clarifying what financialization is, it will be useful to note the
dangers of class warfare in the debate. This essay strives for an
intellectually honest critique of any economic development or policy
disposition that is weighing on the cultivation of prosperity. It does
not seek to exploit or incite class envy. Nor does it seek to utilize
demonization as a substitute for argument.

[Critics of financialization]{.underline}, or at least those prone to
using the term, [have concerns about economic productivity and how
resources are currently allocated.]{.underline} A basic refresher in how
markets work and how resources are most efficiently allocated will be a
useful foundation for this study.

In a similar vein to how class warfare underlies many misguided attacks
on financial markets, [[a vigorous **defense of profits**]{.mark} is
[**paramount** to this discussion]{.mark}]{.underline}. Financial
activity that hurts the common good is fair game for our scrutiny; [[an
activity]{.mark} that is [criticized **merely** because of its
**profitability** **is not**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This essay will
explore why corporate profits are vital in a prosperous society.

#### Financialization a [catch-all]{.underline} term\-\--it has [different meanings]{.underline}.

David **Bahnsen 24**. An American portfolio manager, author, and
television commentator. Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer of
The Bahnsen Group. "Financialization and Missed Boats." American
Institute for Economic Research. 11-25-2024.
https://aier.org/article/financialization-and-missed-boats/ //reyrey

[[**'Financialization'** can mean different things in different
contexts]{.underline}]{.mark}, but it generally carries negative
overtones. [The [**definition matters** because]{.mark},]{.underline}
for some (including the author), there is a 'financialization'
phenomenon that warrants significant criticism. But upon closer
scrutiny[, the [actions]{.mark} most often [described as
'financialization' **warrant no such criticism.**]{.mark} A **coherent
definition** also [allows **for precision**]{.mark} in what is being
scrutinized and criticized,]{.underline} while failure to define the
term properly risks generating an inadequate critique of what should be
criticized, and a wrongheaded critique of that which should not.

There is an abstract but fair context in which financialization is a
catch-all term for a "greater role for the financial sector in the
economy." At that level, it is a reasonably benign description and does
not necessarily indicate any malignant effects on the economy as a whole
or specific economic sectors. Here 'financialization' simply describes a
scenario whereby capital markets activity becomes more prominent.

Other [conceptions of financializations, however, are **explicit** in
their **condemnation** of the manner in which financial markets
**re-allocate capital** in ways that increase profits to owners of
capital but without paying heed to what such critics' conceptions of
social justice or equality]{.underline}. An example of this is an
American Affairs article that views financial actors as tools of "market
worship" which, its author claims, undermines a just and responsible
society.

[A more particular definition of financialization might incorporate the
influence or power of financial markets in overall economic
administration. I]{.underline}f we referred to the 'technologization' of
society we would more likely be referring to a greater use of technology
than increased power for technology elites, but it seems fair to allow
for the inclusion of both---some increase of use and some increase of
power.

Regardless, however, of what sector of the economy is having a new noun
made out of its description, [[greater use of that sector is **not**
self-evidently **problematic**]{.underline}]{.mark}. It may even be an
obvious improvement ("medical sophistication"). Indeed, one could argue
that influence or power is expected when greater utility is found in a
particular segment of the economy. Whether it be consumer appetites or
just general product novelty, the influence of various segments of the
economy ebb and flow quite organically around their use, relevance, and
capability. A generic increase in the use of financial services and
accompanying influence lacks the specificity necessary to identify it as
problematic.

As the term 'financialization' has gotten more mileage in recent years,
those concerned with its allegedly malignant impact have taken advantage
of the ambiguity, complexity, and mystery of capital markets (real or
perceived) and present them as a malignant force. In this sense, class
envy is a more likely description for much of what is described as
financialization. It is therefore incumbent upon us to break down the
ambiguity of where financial sector activity might be putting downward
pressure on productivity, and where the term is being used only for its
well-poisoning virtues.

Because financialization involves some basis for warranted criticism,
[[mere **financial sector activity** is **not the same** as
financialization]{.mark}.]{.underline} Likewise, [increasing financial
sector [profits]{.mark} should [not be considered]{.mark} the same as
[financialization]{.mark}.]{.underline} Critics are fair (prima facie)
to suggest that if such profits come at the expense of other sectors,
and at the price of total economic growth, then there may be a problem.
However, [the [**mere accumulation** of financial sector profits]{.mark}
is [not financialization]{.mark} unless, in a zero-sum sense, such
profits result from a decline in total profits and productivity. [This
will be a **tough burden** to **overcome**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Is financialization the same thing as securitization, i.e.,
manufacturing financial products (securities) around other aspects of
economic activity and streams of cash flow? Does the economy suffer when
more components of economic life are securitized, meaning, capitalized,
traded, valued, priced, and institutionally owned and monitored? Does
securitization distract from organic economic activity, product
innovation, and customer service? Or does it facilitate more of the
above, mitigate risk, and enhance price discovery? Does securitization
invite profits into the financial sector, while benefiting the public
good by opening new markets for healthy activities (i.e. auto loans,
inventory receivables, debtor financing, and more)? Is a critic of
financialization willing to say that securitization enhances economic
opportunity and activity, but still must be viewed skeptically because
of the enhanced profits it produces for the financial sector?

Some have said that financialization produces a "mismatch between the
public interest and Wall Street interest." [This may be getting closer,
if we believe that scenarios exist where the production of goods and
services that make people's lives better are contrary to the wishes of
**Wall Street**]{.underline} (i.e. our nation's financial markets). [Do
those who invest, steward, trade, and custody capital do better when
that capital is put to work for the public or against the
public]{.underline}? It would be [[a **high burden of proof** to
suggest]{.mark} that the [financial sector at
larg]{.mark}]{.underline}[e]{.mark} (distinct from an individual actor)
[has interests [disconnected from the broad
economy]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The above listed distinctions and clarifications should [make [critics
of Wall Street be **more careful** in **framing their
critiques**]{.mark} of the financial sector. [Confusing]{.mark} the
[financial services]{.mark} sector [by giving the public **exactly what
it wants**]{.mark}]{.underline} for working against public interest [is
[a profound]{.mark} mistake]{.underline}. Close analysis of this dynamic
reveals that what [Wall Street is often being **criticized for
is**]{.underline} not working against the public interest, but rather
[**giving the public** exactly **what it wants** too
liberally]{.underline}. From subprime mortgages to exotic investments,
many products and services may prove to be bad ideas, but they can
hardly be called things that "Wall Street" distributed to "Main Street"
against the latter's will.

[[Nor should financialization's problems]{.mark} be [confused
with]{.mark} the **[mere pursuit of profit]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To
the extent that critics of the profit motive exist, their philosophical
objections are hardly limited to the financial sector. The productive
pursuit of profits in a market economy is a good thing, and this
judgment does not exclude the financial sector. [The [profit motive is
**not a problem**]{.mark} in 'financialized' or in 'non-financialized'
enterprises.]{.underline} Economic activity intermediated by financial
instruments does not suddenly take on a different character. Rather, the
problem is where more productive activities are substituted for less
productive activities. If the production of goods and services towards
the meeting of human needs is replaced by non-productive
'financializing', a problem exists that requires attention.

As we shall see, [such 'financialization' does, indeed, exist. However,
[the culprits behind such]{.mark} are [never the ones targeted

CIS wasn't alone in bootstrapping overpopulation into conversations
about global climate change. Just months earlier, in May 2001, the
IPCC's Third Assessment Report included one of the first sets of
official projections forecasting future relationships between population
growth and carbon emissions.70 [The third assessment projections were
based on [the]{.mark}]{.underline} Special Report on Emissions Scenarios
(2000), which calculated a population/climate proxy by utilizing a
mathematical formula developed by Japanese economists termed "the
[**[Kaya Identity]{.underline}**]{.mark} \[ . . . \] [[a specific

## Transition

### AT: Transition\-\--2AC

#### Transition to socialism always fails.

//KKang

Socialists are fond of saying that socialism has never failed because it
has never been tried. But in truth, [[socialism]{.mark} has **[failed in
every country]{.mark}** in which it has been tried, from the Soviet
Union beginning a century ago to three modern countries that tried but
ultimately rejected socialism---Israel, India, and the United
Kingdom.]{.underline}

While there were major political differences between the totalitarian
rule of the Soviets and the democratic politics of Israel, India, and
the U.K., all three of the latter countries adhered to socialist
principles, nationalizing their major industries and placing economic
decision-making in the hands of the government.

\>\>\> What Americans Must Know About Socialism

[The [**Soviet** **failure**]{.mark} has been [well]{.mark} [documented
by historians]{.mark}.]{.underline} In 1985, General Secretary [Mikhail
Gorbachev took command of a bankrupt disintegrating empire. After 70
years of Marxism, Soviet [farms]{.mark} [were **unable to feed**]{.mark}
the [people,]{.mark} [factories]{.mark} **[failed to meet]{.mark} their
[quotas]{.mark}**, people lined up for blocks in Moscow and other cities
to buy bread and other necessities, and a war in Afghanistan dragged on
with no end in sight of the body bags of young Soviet
soldiers.]{.underline}

[The economies of the [Communist nations]{.mark} behind the Iron Curtain
were similarly **[enfeebled]{.mark}** because they functioned in large
measure as colonies of the Soviet Union.]{.underline} With no incentives
to compete or modernize, the industrial sector of Eastern and Central
Europe became a monument to bureaucratic inefficiency and waste, [a
"museum of the early industrial age." As the New York Times pointed out
at the time, Singapore, an Asian city-state of only 2 million people,
exported 20 percent more machinery to the West in 1987 than all of
Eastern Europe.]{.underline}

And yet, [[socialism]{.mark} still [beguiled]{.mark} leading
[intellectuals]{.mark} and politicians of the West. They could not
resist its siren song, of a world without strife because it was a world
without private property.]{.underline} They were convinced that a
bureaucracy could make more-informed decisions about the welfare of a
people than the people themselves could. [[They believed]{.mark}, with
John Maynard Keynes, that "[the **state is wise** and the]{.mark}
**[market]{.mark} is [stupid]{.mark}."**]{.underline}

[Israel, India, and the United Kingdom all adopted socialism as an
economic model following World War II.]{.underline} The preamble to
India's constitution, for example, begins, "We, the People of India,
having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a Sovereign Socialist
Secular Democratic Republic . . ." [The original settlers of Israel were
East European Jews of the Left who sought and built a socialist society.
As soon as the guns of World War II fell silent, Britain's Labour Party
nationalized every major industry and acceded to every socialist demand
of the unions.]{.underline}

At first, socialism seemed to work in these vastly dissimilar countries.
For the first two decades of its existence, Israel's economy grew at an
annual rate of more than 10 percent, leading many to term Israel an
"economic miracle." The average GDP growth rate of India from its
founding in 1947 into the 1970s was 3.5 percent, placing India among the
more prosperous developing nations. GDP growth in Great Britain averaged
3 percent from 1950 to 1965, along with a 40 percent rise in average
real wages, enabling Britain to become one of the world's more affluent
countries.

But the [government [**planners** were **unable to keep pace** with
increasing population]{.mark} and overseas competition.]{.underline}
After decades of ever declining economic growth and ever rising
unemployment, all three countries abandoned socialism and turned toward
capitalism and the free market. [The resulting prosperity in Israel,
India, and the U.K. vindicated free-marketers who had predicted that
[socialism]{.mark} would inevitably [fail to deliver]{.mark} the
[goods]{.mark}.]{.underline} As British prime minister Margaret Thatcher
observed, ["[the]{.mark} [**problem** with socialism is]{.mark} that
**[you]{.mark} eventually [run out of other people's
money]{.mark}**."]{.underline}

### AT: Transition\-\--1AR

#### Israel:

**Edwards \'19.** \[Lee Edwards; an American academic and author and a

//KKang

[[Israel]{.mark}]{.underline} is unique, the only nation where socialism
was successful---for a while. The original settlers, according to
Israeli professor Avi Kay, "sought to create an economy in which market
forces were controlled for the benefit of the whole society." Driven by
a desire to leave behind their history as victims of penury and
prejudice, they sought an egalitarian, labor-oriented socialist society.
The initial, homogeneous [[population]{.mark} of less than 1 million
drew up **[centralized plans]{.mark}** to convert the desert
[into]{.mark} green [pastures and]{.mark} build [efficient]{.mark}
state-run [companies]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Most early settlers, American Enterprise Institute scholar Joseph Light
pointed out, worked either on collective farms called kibbutzim or in
state-guaranteed jobs. The kibbutzim were small farming communities in
which people did chores in exchange for food and money to live on and
pay their bills. [There was [no private property]{.mark}, people ate in
common, and children under 18 lived together and not with their parents.
[Any money earned]{.mark} on the outside was [given to the
kibbutz.]{.mark}]{.underline}

A key player in the socialization of Israel was the Histadrut, the
General Federation of Labor, subscribers to the socialist dogma that
capital exploits labor and that the only way to prevent such "robbery"
is to grant control of the means of production to the state. As it
proceeded to unionize almost all workers, the Histadrut gained control
of nearly every economic and social sector, including the kibbutzim,
housing, transportation, banks, social welfare, health care, and
education. The federation's political instrument was the Labor party,
which effectively ruled Israel from the founding of Israel in 1948 until
1973 and the Yom Kippur War. In the early years, few asked whether any
limits should be placed on the role of government.

Israel's economic performance seemed to confirm Keynes's judgment.
[[Real GDP]{.mark} growth from 1955 to 1975 [was]{.mark} an astounding
[12.6 percent]{.mark}, putting Israel among the fastest-growing
economies in the world, with one of the lowest income differentials.
However, this rapid growth was [accompanied by]{.mark} rising levels of
private consumption and, over time, increasing **[income
inequality]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There was an increasing demand for
economic reform to free the economy from the government's centralized
decision-making. [In 1961, supporters of economic liberalization formed
the Liberal party---the first political movement committed to a market
economy.]{.underline}

[The]{.underline} Israeli "[[economic miracle]{.mark}"
**[evaporated]{.mark}** in 1965 [when the country suffered]{.mark} its
**first [major recession.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Economic growth halted
and unemployment rose threefold from 1965 to 1967. Before the government
could attempt corrective action, the Six-Day War erupted, altering
Israel's economic and political map. Paradoxically, the war brought
short-lived prosperity to Israel, owing to increased military spending
and a major influx of workers from new territories. But government-led
economic growth was accompanied by accelerating inflation, reaching an
annual rate of 17 percent from 1971 to 1973.

For the first time, [there was a public debate between supporters of
free-enterprise economics and supporters of traditional socialist
arrangements.]{.underline} Leading the way for the free market was the
future Nobel Prize winner Milton Friedman, who urged Israeli
policymakers to "set your people free" and liberalize the economy. [[The
1973 war]{.mark} and its economic impacts [reinforced]{.mark} the
[feelings]{.mark} of many Israelis [that]{.mark} the Labor party's
[socialist model **could not handle**]{.mark} the country's growing
**[econ]{.mark}omic [challenges]{.mark}**. The 1977 elections resulted
in the victory of the Likud party, with its staunch pro-free-market
philosophy. The Likud took as one of its coalition partners the Liberal
party.]{.underline}

Because socialism's roots in Israel were so deep, real reform proceeded
slowly. Friedman was asked to draw up a program that would move Israel
from socialism toward a free-market economy. His major reforms included
fewer government programs and reduced government spending; less
government intervention in fiscal, trade, and labor policies; income-tax
cuts; and privatization. A great debate ensued between government
officials seeking reform and special interests that preferred the status
quo.

Meanwhile, [the [gov]{.mark}ernment [kept borrowing]{.mark} and spending
[and driving up **inflation**,]{.mark} which averaged 77 percent for
1978--79 and [reached a peak of **450 percent**]{.mark} in
1984--85.]{.underline} The government's share of the economy grew to 76
percent, while fiscal deficits and national debt skyrocketed. The
government printed money through loans from the Bank of Israel, which
contributed to the inflation by churning out money.

Finally, in January 1983, [[the bubble burst]{.mark}, and thousands of
private [citizens and businesses]{.mark} as well as government-run
enterprises [faced bankruptcy]{.mark}]{.underline}. Israel was close to
collapse. [At this critical moment, a sympathetic U.S. president, Ronald
Reagan, and his secretary of state, George Shultz, came to the
rescue.]{.underline} They offered a grant of \$1.5 billion if the
Israeli government agreed to abandon its socialist rulebook and adopt
some form of U.S.-style capitalism, using American-trained
professionals.

The Histadrut strongly resisted, unwilling to give up their decades-old
power and to concede that socialism was responsible for Israel's
economic troubles. However, the people had had enough of soaring
inflation and non-existent growth and rejected the Histadrut's policy of
resistance. Still, the Israeli government hesitated, unwilling to spend
political capital on economic reform. An exasperated Secretary Schulz
informed Israel that if it did not begin freeing up the economy, the
U.S. would freeze "all monetary transfers" to the country. The threat
worked. The Israeli government officially adopted most of the
free-market "recommendations."

[**[The impact of a]{.mark} basic [shift]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} Israeli
[econ]{.mark}omic [policy was **immediate**]{.mark} and pervasive.
Within a year, [inflation tumbled from 450 percent to]{.mark} just
[20]{.mark} percent, [a budget deficit of 15 percent]{.mark} of GDP
[shrank to]{.mark} [zero]{.mark},]{.underline} the Histadrut's economic
and business empire disappeared along with its political domination, and
the Israeli economy was opened to imports. [Of particular importance was
[the Israeli high-tech]{.mark} [revolution]{.mark}, which led to a 600
percent increase in investment in Israel, transforming the country into
a major player in the high-tech world.]{.underline}

[There were [troubling side effects]{.mark} such as [social gaps,
poverty]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} concerns about social [justice]{.mark},
but the socialist rhetoric and ideology, according to Glenn Frankel, the
Washington Post's correspondent in Israel, "has been permanently
[retired]{.mark}."]{.underline} The socialist Labor party endorsed
privatization and the divestment of many publicly held companies that
had become corrupted by featherbedding, rigid work rules, phony
bookkeeping, favoritism, and incompetent managers.

[After modest expansion in the 1990s, Israel's economic growth topped
the charts in the developing world in the 2000s, propelled by low
inflation and a reduction in the size of government.]{.underline}
Unemployment was still too high and taxes took up 40 percent of GDP,
much of it caused by the need for a large military. However, political
parties are agreed that there is no turning back to the economic
policies of the early years---the debate is about the rate of further
market reform. "The world's most successful experiment in socialism,"
Light wrote, "appears to have resolutely embraced capitalism."

[India]{.underline}

[[Acceptance of socialism]{.mark} was [strong in India]{.mark} long
before independence, [spurred]{.mark} [by]{.mark}
widespread]{.underline} [[**resentment** against]{.mark} British
[colonialism]{.mark}]{.underline} and the land-owning princely class
(the zamindars) and by the efforts of the Communist Party of India,
established in 1921. Jawaharlal [Nehru adopted socialism as the ruling
ideology when he became India's first prime minister after independence
in 1947]{.underline}.

For nearly 30 years, the [[Indian gov]{.mark}ernment adhered to a
socialist line, [restricting imports]{.mark}, [prohibiting]{.mark}
foreign direct [investment, protecting]{.mark} small companies from
[competition]{.mark} from large corporations, [and]{.mark}
**[maintaining]{.mark} price [controls]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} a wide
variety of industries including [steel]{.mark}, cement, fertilizers,
[petroleum]{.mark}, and [pharma]{.mark}ceuticals.]{.underline} Any
producer who exceeded their licensed capacity faced possible
imprisonment.

As the Indian economist Swaminathan S. Anklesaria Aiyar wrote, "India
was perhaps the only country in the world where [improving
**[productivity]{.mark} . . . [was a crime]{.mark}**."]{.underline} It
was a strict application of the socialist principle that the market
cannot be trusted to produce good economic or social outcomes. Economic
inequality was regulated through taxes---the top personal income tax
rate hit a stifling 97.75 percent.

Some [14 public banks were nationalized in 1969; six more banks were
taken over by the government in 1980. Driven by the principle of
"self-reliance," almost anything that could be produced domestically
could not be imported regardless of the cost.]{.underline} It was the
"zenith" of Indian socialism, which still failed to satisfy the basic
needs of an ever expanding population. In 1977--78, more than half of
India was living below the poverty line.

At the same time, notes Indian-American economist Arvind Panagariya, a
series of external shocks shook the country, including a war with
Pakistan in 1965, which came on the heels of a war with China in 1962;
another war with Pakistan in 1971; consecutive droughts in 1971--72 and
1972--73, and the oil price crisis of October 1973, which contributed to
a 40 percent deterioration in India's foreign trade.

[**[Econ]{.mark}omic [performance]{.mark}** from 1965 to 1981 was
[**worse** than]{.mark} at [any other time]{.mark} of the
post-independence period]{.underline}. As in Israel, economic reform
became an imperative. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had pushed her policy
agenda as far to the left as possible. In 1980, the Congress party won a
two-thirds majority in the Parliament, and Gandhi adopted, [at last, a
more pragmatic, non-ideological course. But as with everything else in
India, economic reform proceeded slowly]{.underline}.

An industrial-policy statement continued the piecemeal retreat from
socialism that had begun in 1975, allowing companies to expand their
capacity, encouraging investment in a wide variety of industries, and
introducing private-sector participation in telecommunications. [Further
[liberalization]{.mark} received a major boost under Rajiv Gandhi, who
succeeded his mother in 1984 following her assassination. As a result,
[GDP growth reached]{.mark} an encouraging [5.5
percent.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Economics continued to trump ideology under Rajiv Gandhi, who was free
of the socialist baggage carried by an earlier generation. His
successor, P. V. Narasimha Rao, put an end to licensing except in
selected sectors and opened the door to much wider foreign investment.
[Finance minister Manmohan [Singh cut]{.mark} the [tariff]{.mark} rates
[from]{.mark} an astronomical **[355]{.mark} percent [to 65
percent]{.mark}**.]{.underline} According to Arvind Panagariya, "the
government had introduced enough liberalizing measures to set the
economy on the course to sustaining approximately 6 percent growth on a
long-term basis." In fact, India's GDP growth reached a peak of over 9
percent in 2005--8, followed by a dip to just under 7 percent in
2017--18.

[[A]{.mark} major [development of]{.mark} the [econ]{.mark}omic
[reforms]{.mark} was [the]{.mark} remarkable [expansion **of India's
middle class.**]{.mark} The Economist estimates there are 78 million
Indians in the middle-middle and upper middle-class
category.]{.underline} By including the lower middle class, Indian
economists Krishnan and Hatekar figure that India's new middle class
grew from 304.2 million in 2004--5 to an amazing 606.3 million in
2011--12, almost one-half of the entire Indian population. [The daily
income of the three middle classes are lower middle, \$2--\$4; middle
middle, \$4--\$6; upper middle, \$6--\$10.]{.underline}

While this is extremely low by U.S. standards, a dollar goes a long way
in India, where [the annual per capita income is approximately \$6,500.
If only half of the lower middle class makes the transition to
upper-class or middle income, that would mean an Indian middle class of
about 350 million Indians]{.underline}---a mid-point between The
Economist and Krishnan and Hatekar estimates. Such an enormous middle
class confirms the judgment of the Heritage Foundation, in its Index of
Economic Freedom, that India is developing into an "open-market
economy."

[In 2017, India overtook Germany to become the fourth-largest auto
market in the world, and it is expected to displace Japan in
2020]{.underline}. That same year, India overtook the U.S. in smartphone
sales to become the second-largest smartphone market in the world.
Usually described as an agricultural country, India is today 31 percent
urbanized. With an annual GDP of \$8.7 trillion, [India ranks fifth in
the world, behind the United States, China, Japan, and Great Britain.
Never before in recorded history, Indian economist Gurcharan Das has
noted, have so many people risen so quickly.]{.underline}

[[All this]{.mark} has been [accomplished because]{.mark} the political
[leaders of India]{.mark} sought and [adopted a better economic
system]{.mark}---free enterprise---after some four decades of fitful
progress and unequal prosperity under socialism.]{.underline}

United Kingdom

[Widely [described as "the sick man of Europe]{.mark}" [after three
decades of socialism]{.mark}, the United Kingdom underwent an economic
revolution in the 1970s and 1980s because of one remarkable
person---Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.]{.underline} Some skeptics
doubted that she could pull it off---the U.K. was then a mere shadow of
its once prosperous free-market self.

[The [gov]{.mark}ernment [owned]{.mark} the [largest]{.mark}
manufacturing [firms in]{.mark} such industries as [autos and
steel]{.mark}. The top individual [tax]{.mark} [rates were **83
percent**]{.mark} on "earned income" [and]{.mark} a crushing [**98
percent** on]{.mark} income from [capital]{.mark}.]{.underline} Much of
the housing was government-owned. For decades, the U.K. had grown more
slowly than economies on the continent. Great Britain was no longer
"great" and seemed headed for the economic dust bin.

[The major hindrance to economic reform was the powerful trade unions,
which since 1913 had been allowed to spend union funds on political
objectives, such as controlling the Labour party]{.underline}. [Unions
inhibited productivity and discouraged investment.]{.underline} From
1950 to 1975, the U.K.'s investment and productivity record was the
worst of any major industrial country. Trade-union demands increased the
size of the public sector and public expenditures to 59 percent of GDP.
[Wage and benefits [demands]{.mark} by organized labor [led to]{.mark}
continual [**strikes** that **paralyzed transportation and
production**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In 1978, Labour prime minister James Callaghan decided that, rather than
hold an election, he would "soldier on" to the following spring. It was
a fatal mistake. His government encountered the legendary "winter of
discontent" in the first months of 1979. [Public-sector workers went on
strike for weeks. [Mountains of]{.mark} uncollected [**rubbish piled**
high]{.mark} in cities. **[Bodies remained unburied]{.mark}** and
**[rats ran]{.mark}** in the streets.]{.underline}

Newly elected Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher, the United
Kingdom's first female PM, took on what she considered her main
opponent---the unions. Flying pickets, the ground troops of industrial
conflict who would travel to support workers on strike at another site,
were banned and could no longer blockade factories or ports. Strike
ballots were made compulsory. The closed shop, which forced workers to
join a union to get a job, was outlawed. [Union membership plummeted
from a peak of 12 million in the late 1970s to half that by the late
1980s.]{.underline} "It's now or never for \[our\] economic policies,"
Thatcher declared, "let's stick to our guns." The top rate of personal
income tax was cut in half, to 45 percent, and exchange controls were
abolished.

**[[Privatization]{.underline}]{.mark}** was a core Thatcher reform. Not
only was it fundamental to the improvement of the economy. It [was "one
of [the central means of **reversing**]{.mark} the corrosive and
**[corrupting effects of]{.mark} [socialism]{.mark}**," she wrote in her
memoirs. Through privatization that leads to the widest possible
ownership by members of the public, "the state's power is reduced and
the power of the people enhanced."]{.underline} Privatization "is at the
center of any programme of reclaiming territory for freedom." She was as
good as her word, selling off government-owned airlines, airports,
utilities, and phone, steel, and oil companies.

In the 1980s, [Britain's economy grew faster than that of any other
European economy except Spain.]{.underline} U.K. business investment
grew faster than in any other country except Japan. Productivity grew
faster than in any other industrial economy. Some 3.3 million new jobs
were created between March 1983 and March 1990. [[Inflation fell
from]{.mark} a high of [27 percent in 1975 to 2.5 percent]{.mark} in
1986. From 1981 to 1989, under a Conservative government, real GDP
growth averaged 3.2 percent]{.underline}.

By the time Thatcher left government, the state-owned sector of industry
had been reduced by some 60 percent. As she recounted in her memoirs,
about one in four Britons owned shares in the market. Over 600,000 jobs
had passed from the public to the private sector. [The U.K. had "set a
worldwide trend in privatization in countries as different as
Czechoslovakia and New Zealand.]{.underline}" Turning decisively away
from Keynesian management, [the once sick man of Europe now bloomed with
robust economic health.]{.underline} No succeeding British government,
Labour or Conservative, has tried to renationalize what Margaret
Thatcher denationalized.

China

How then to explain the impressive economic success of a fourth major
economy, China, with annual GDP growth of 8 to 10 percent from the 1980s
almost to the present? [From 1949 to 1976, under Mao Zedong, China was
an economic basket case, owing to Mao's personal mismanagement of the
economy. In his avid pursuit of Soviet-style socialism, [Mao
brought]{.mark} about [the Great Leap Forward]{.mark} of 1958--60,
[which resulted in the **deaths** of]{.mark} at least 30 million and
perhaps as many as **[50 million Chinese]{.mark}**, [and the Cultural
Revolution]{.mark} of 1966--76, [in which]{.mark} an additional 3
million to **[5 million died]{.mark}**. Mao left China backward and
deeply divided.]{.underline}

Mao's successor, Deng [[Xiaoping]{.mark}, [turned China]{.mark} in a
different direction, seeking [to]{.mark} create a mixed economy in which
[capitalism]{.mark} and socialism would coexist with the Communist Party
monitoring and constantly adjusting the proper mix.]{.underline} For the
past four decades, China has been the economic marvel of the world for
the following reasons:

It began its economic ascent almost from ground zero because of Mao's
ideological stubbornness. It has engaged in the calculated theft of
intellectual property, especially from the U.S., for decades. It has
taken full advantage of globalism and its membership in the World Trade
Organization, while ignoring the prescribed rules against such practices
as intellectual-property theft. It has used tariffs and other
protectionist measures to gain trade advantages with the U.S. and other
competitors.

[It [created a **middle class of**]{.mark} **some [300 million]{.mark}**
people, who enjoy a decent living and at the same time constitute a
sizable domestic market for goods and services.]{.underline} It
continues to use the forced labor of the laogai to make cheap consumer
goods that are sold in Walmart and other Western stores. It allows an
enormous black market to exist because Party members profit from its
sales.

[It permits foreign investors to buy into Chinese companies, but the
government---i.e., the Communist Party---always retains a majority
interest.]{.underline} It operates an estimated 150,000 state-owned
enterprises that guarantee jobs for tens of millions of Chinese. [It
depends on the energy and experience of the most entrepreneurial people
in the world, second only to Americans.]{.underline}

[In short, the People's Republic of China was an economic failure for
its first three decades under Mao and Soviet socialism. [It began its
climb]{.mark} to become the second-largest economy in the world when it
abandoned socialism in the late Seventies and initiated its experiment,
which so far has been successful, in capitalism with Chinese
characteristics.]{.underline}

There are clear signs that such [success is no longer automatic. China
is experiencing a slowing economy]{.underline}, is ruled by a
dictatorial but divided Communist Party clinging to power, faces
widespread public demands for the guarantee of fundamental human rights,
and suffers from a seriously degraded environment. [History suggests
that these problems can best be solved by a democratic government ruled
by the people, not a one-party authoritarian state that resorts to
violence in a crisis, as Beijing did at Tiananmen Square and is doing in
Hong Kong.]{.underline}

Conclusion

As [we have seen from our examination of Israel, India, and the United
Kingdom, [the econ]{.mark}omic [system]{.mark} that works best for the
greatest number [is]{.mark} not socialism with its central controls,
utopian promises, and OPM (other people's money), but [the free-market
system with]{.mark} its emphasis on **[competition and]{.mark}
[entrepreneurship]{.mark}.**]{.underline} All three countries tried
socialism for decades, and all three finally rejected it for the
simplest of reasons---it doesn't work.

[[Socialism is guilty of a **fatal conceit**:]{.mark} [It
believes]{.mark} its [system can make better decisions for]{.mark} the
[people than]{.mark} they can for [themselves]{.mark}. I]{.underline}t
is the end product of a 19th-century prophet whose prophecies (such as
the inevitable disappearance of the middle class) have been proven wrong
time and again.

According to the World Bank, [more than [one billion]{.mark} people have
[lifted themselves out of poverty]{.mark} in the past 25
years,]{.underline} "one of the greatest human achievements of our
time." Of those billion, approximately 731 million are Chinese, and 168
million Indians. [[The main driver]{.mark} of this uplift from poverty
[has been]{.mark} the [globalization]{.mark} of the international
trading system.]{.underline} China owes most of its success to the trade
freedom offered by the U.S. and the rest of the world. The latest
edition of Index of Economic Freedom from the Heritage Foundation
confirms the global trend toward economic freedom: Economies rated
"free" or "mostly free" enjoy incomes that are more than five times
higher than the incomes of "repressed economies" such as those of North
Korea, Venezuela, and Cuba.

Israel's socialist miracle turned out to be a mirage, India discarded
socialist ideology and chose a more market-oriented path, and the United
Kingdom set an example for the rest of the world with its emphasis on
privatization and deregulation. [Whether we are talking about the
actions of an agricultural country of 1.3 billion, or the nation that
sparked the industrial revolution, or a small Middle Eastern country
populated by some of the smartest people in the world, **[capitalism
tops socialism every time.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

### Transition\-\--AT: Planning\-\--2AC

Mises' [initial '**[calculation']{.mark}** argument [focuses upon the
'supply side' problems]{.mark} that [planners]{.mark} would
[face]{.mark}. T]{.underline}his is made evident by his assumption of
[[planners having established a '**target'**]{.mark} set of final goods
that [reflects]{.mark} the [current needs]{.mark} and priorities of
society]{.underline} (Mises 1920, 107). Even given these assumptions, he
argues, socialist [**[planners]{.mark} would [face]{.mark}** the
profoundly [complex problem of establishing how to produce]{.mark} the
[target]{.mark} set [of final goods and services]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[[This challenge]{.underline}]{.mark}, that Mises views as
[[**insurmountabl**e]{.mark}, concerns [how to choose]{.mark} specific
[combinations of]{.mark} factors of [production]{.mark} (labor, natural
resources, and capital goods) for producing the target set.]{.underline}
In the absence of markets, Mises holds, planners would have no way of
establishing which factor combinations, or production methods, should be
used to make production as efficient as possible. Markets, Mises made
clear, are not perfect (Greenwood 2006). [However, he argued, they do
have at least a tendency to promote the rational allocation of
resources.]{.underline} [[Attempts to **replace**]{.mark} factor
[markets]{.mark} with non-market planning, he held, **[would lead to a
huge fall]{.mark}** in living standards for the population]{.underline}
(Mises 1920, 130).

For Mises[, [this]{.mark} supply side [problem alone is sufficient to
**render socialism unfeasible**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Mises 1920, 90).
He considers this supply side calculation problem to be logically
separable from 'demand side' questions of 1 Some commentators have
suggested that Hayek's contributions to the calculation debate offer a
distinct argument from Mises' formulation of the calculation problem
(for example, Salerno 1990). [However, [the]{.mark} essentially
[**epistemological** nature of]{.mark} the [calculation]{.mark} problem
formulated by both Mises and Hayek has since been widely
emphasized]{.underline}, even though Hayek's work has a more explicit
epistemological emphasis (Greenwood 2007b; Lavoie 1985; Yeagar 1996).
DAPPRICH AND GREENWOOD / CYBERSOCIALISM AND THE SOCIALIST CALCULATION
DEBATE VOLUME 17, ISSUE 1, SUMMER 2024 6 how to establish which goods
and services to produce, given the needs and preferences of the
population. However, as he makes clear, [[there]{.mark} [must]{.mark}
necessarily [be an **interrelationship** between **supply and
demand**]{.mark} side calculation. Factor [valuations]{.mark}
[must]{.mark} [reflect]{.mark} the prioritization, or '[demand]{.mark},'
for different final goods, [regardless of]{.mark} the type of market or
[planning]{.mark} through which this demand is being
established]{.underline}. For, even if a set of final goods targets are
defined by socialist planners, these targets will affect relative factor
values through a process referred to by Mises (1920, 90) as 'factor
imputation' (see also Lavoie 1985, 51; Mises 1936, 117). [For example,
if the demand for domestic heating increases, this will, ceteris
paribus, cause an increase in the relative value of factors involved in
energy production.]{.underline}

### Transition\-\--Crackdown\-\--2AC

#### Crackdown -- history proves.

Marxism-Leninism" published by FRSO, and regular contributor to Fight

//KKang

[[Marxism]{.mark}-Leninism [is the science of revolution.
]{.mark}]{.underline}The purpose of revolutionary theory is to guide
revolutionary practice. Nevertheless, since Marxism was young, there
have always been opportunists and revisionists who tried to distort its
revolutionary essence. The leading edge of this attack on Marxism --
from the misleaders of the Second International, Eduard Bernstein and
Karl Kautsky in the early 1900s, to Khrushchev's modern revisionism,
beginning with the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet
Union (CPSU) in 1956 -- has been the advocacy of a peaceful transition
from capitalism to socialism.

[[Can the bourgeois]{.mark} state [be reformed]{.mark} [and led]{.mark}
peacefully [towards socialism]{.mark}? What is there to learn from past
attempts]{.underline}? [[Even as recently as]{.mark} Bernie
[Sanders]{.mark}' campaigns for the presidency, we saw [the]{.mark}
[**ruling class unite** to deny]{.mark} the possibility of a Sanders
candidacy.]{.underline} [Even his **[mild]{.mark}**, [social
democratic]{.mark} [reforms]{.mark} were too much for the U.S.
**monopoly capitalist class**.]{.underline}

As Lenin said, and history has proven, "[[Never]{.mark}...[will]{.mark}
the [**exploiters submit** to the decision of the]{.mark} [exploited
majority]{.mark} without trying to make use of their advantages in a
last desperate battle, or series of battles]{.underline}." Just look at
the revolutionary movements of the past: for example, [[the U.S. aerial
bombing]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the coal [miners]{.mark} of Blair
Mountain]{.underline} in West Virginia in 1921, or, more recently,
[[the]{.mark} FBI and police [**repression** of the **B**]{.mark}lack
**[P]{.mark}**anther **[P]{.mark}**arty in the 1960s and
70s]{.underline}, and the jailing and murder of its leaders like Fred
Hampton. [Civil Rights leader Martin Luther [King]{.mark}
Jr]{.underline}., in spite of his firm commitment to non-violence, [[was
**assassinated**]{.mark}.]{.underline} All of these movements were met
with counter-revolutionary violence.

Summing up the defeat of the Paris Commune in 1871, Marx said, "the
working class cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state machinery,
and wield it for its own purposes[." Instead, it must be smashed, and
this is especially true of [its military, the force]{.mark} that
**[maintains the power]{.mark}** of the ruling class. This is why Marx
said that "under no pretext should arms and ammunition be surrendered;
any attempt to disarm the workers must be frustrated, by force if
necessary."]{.underline} Gun control leaves working and oppressed people
defenseless.

#### Trump will suppress any left-wing movement.

In a series of interviews and public statements since Sunday, Republican
presidential candidate [[Donald]{.mark} [Trump]{.mark} has
[expanded]{.mark} his **threats** [of violent repression]{.mark},
initially [focused on immigrants, to include]{.mark} wider sections of
the working class and youth, Democratic [Party leaders and]{.mark}
virtually [anyone who opposes]{.mark} his [fascistic
policies.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump speaks at
a campaign event at the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre, Tuesday,
Oct. 15, 2024, in Atlanta. \[AP Photo/Alex Brandon\]

The latest threats began with Trump's appearance on the Fox program
"Sunday Morning Futures," where [[he]{.mark} [told]{.mark} host Maria
[Bartiromo]{.mark} that "[**radical-left lunatics**" were a greater
threat]{.mark} to the United States [than any]{.mark} [outside
power]{.mark}, and that [the **National** **Guard** or regular
**military** would be **needed to move against
them.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

"I always say, we have two enemies," he said. "[We have the outside
enemy, and then we have the enemy from within, and [the **enemy** from
within]{.mark}, in my opinion, [**is more dangerous** than China,
Russia]{.mark} and all these countries."]{.underline}

[[Trump]{.mark} [singled out]{.mark}]{.underline} Representative Adam
[[Schiff]{.underline}]{.mark} of California [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
former House Speaker Nancy [[Pelosi]{.underline}]{.mark}, calling them
"evil" and "dangerous" at a town hall election meeting Tuesday night.
"[[They're Marxist]{.mark}s and [communists]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
[fascists]{.mark}, and they're sick,"]{.underline} he claimed. Handling
foreign antagonists was important, he declared, but "\[[t\]he more
difficult are, you know, the Pelosis, these people, they're so sick and
they're so evil."]{.underline}

Claiming that right-wing capitalist politicians like Schiff, Pelosi,
Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden are advocates of socialism and
Marxism might appear to be evidence of the 78-year-old Trump's ongoing
mental decline. [But such charges are a staple of the fascist wing of
the capitalist class, for whom even a pretended sympathy for the working
class is considered an incitement to revolution.]{.underline}

The Republican presidential candidate reiterated his threats before a
corporate audience Tuesday at the Economic Club of Chicago, where he
refused to commit himself to recognize the results of the election and
again repeated his desire to use military force against his opponents.
When Bloomberg News moderator John Micklethwait asked him if he would
support a peaceful transfer of power, Trump replied that in 2020, "you
had a peaceful transfer of power." He was referring to the fact that he
left Washington on January 20, as Biden was being inaugurated, because
his attempted coup had failed on January 6.

Earlier, at a Saturday evening rally in Coachella, California[,
[Trump]{.mark} [described]{.mark} his "Operation [Aurora]{.mark}" plan
for mass deportations of immigrants. "[We're like an **occupied**
country]{.mark}," he said, adding that November 5, Election Day, would
be "liberation day."]{.underline} Such language from Trump has already
been the precursor of violence. When he called on supporters during the
COVID lockdowns to "liberate Michigan" and several other states,
fascists armed with semi-automatic weapons mobilized at the state
capitol in Lansing and elsewhere.

The New York Times reported, with evident alarm, ["never before has a
presidential nominee---let alone a former president---openly suggested
turning the military on American citizens simply because they oppose his
candidacy.]{.underline} As he escalates his threats of political
retribution, Trump is offering voters the choice of a very different,
and far less democratic, form of American government."

Contrary to the Times, Trump is not offering voters this as a "choice."
[[He is signaling to his allies in the]{.mark} military-intelligence
apparatus, the Supreme Court and in fascist and **[militia
circles]{.mark}** that [they must]{.mark} make ready to
[intervene]{.mark}, either during or immediately after the election, to
hijack the election and deny the voters any choice at all.]{.underline}

Trump's remarks come shortly after the publication of a new book, War,
by longtime Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward, which includes
interviews with a number of leading figures in the US capital on Trump's
plans for dictatorship. [General Mark Milley, nominated by Trump as
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 2019, told Woodward that the
former commander-in-chief was "fascist to the core."]{.underline}

In his public embrace of authoritarian violence, Trump is responding to
the urgings of key billionaire supporters, who recently pumped \$220
million into his campaign, which was falling considerably behind
Democratic candidate Harris in the fundraising department. This includes
\$75 million from Elon Musk, who has begun a series of public campaign
events for Trump, as well as billionaire Zionist Miriam Adelson, widow
of a Las Vegas casino mogul, and ultra-right packaging billionaire
Richard Uihlein.

[This section of [the]{.mark} American ruling **[elite]{.mark} is
[clearly alarmed]{.mark}** [by]{.mark} the developing [movement of
workers]{.mark} and young people against the policies of imperialist
war, economic austerity and attacks on democratic rights.]{.underline}
They look at events like the Boeing workers' strike and student protests
against the US-Israeli genocide in Gaza, and have, for good reason,
nightmares about social revolution.

[The nominal [opposition]{.mark}]{.underline}, Harris, Biden and the
Democrats[, [is just as **ferociously** **committed**]{.mark} to the
program of the capitalist ruling elite as Trump and the
Republicans.]{.underline} They advocate only a different tactic, relying
on the trade unions to suppress the class struggle and on the
pseudo-left groups and figures like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to mislead
and disorient those opposed to imperialist war and genocide.

This fundamental class agreement explains the half-hearted and spineless
response by the Democrats to Trump's threats of violence and mass
repression[. For weeks after outgoing President Biden warned the
Democratic National Convention that Trump would not accept the results
of the 2024 election, the Harris-Walz campaign has downplayed the
fascist threat.]{.underline}

### Transition\-\--AT: Socialism\-\--2AC

In Wallis's critique of market socialism, he points to the need to
recognize that [the [socialist road is]{.mark} **[bumpy]{.mark}** and
that [many]{.mark} of its [**features resemble** **the old
system**]{.mark}, which socialists are supposedly attempting to
liquidate]{.underline}. Wallis agrees with Bertell Ollman in opposing
market socialism while acknowledging that "[[post-rev]{.mark}olutionary
[society will contain de facto market]{.mark} elements."]{.underline}
This view fits in with Wallis's overall vision of the transition to
socialism impregnated with contradictions and tensions. Wallis concludes
that [among Marxists who write on market socialism "the real debate is
over different ways of approaching and navigating a universally
recognized conflict]{.underline}" as opposed to what he considers to be
the erroneous contention (the promarket socialism view) that the
"principles of 'market' and 'socialism' do not clash."4

Wallis's interpretation of Marxist dialectics guides his analysis of
Soviet rule. His objective is to demonstrate "[those ways in which [the
new **society is**]{.mark} **both [generated]{.mark}** [and conditioned
by the old]{.mark}."]{.underline} Wallis points out that from the very
outset[, [remnants of the old system were ever present]{.mark},
tolerated, [and]{.mark} even **[promoted]{.mark}** not only in the form
of the New Economic Policy but also industry managers who Lenin insisted
be allowed to run enterprises.]{.underline} As a result, "draconian
capitalist methods" as well as aspects of Taylorism prevailed at the
workplace. In the process, workers' self-management -- a topic to which
Wallis devotes a chapter in order to demonstrate the system's
feasibility and viability throughout the twentieth century -- was
sacrificed and even considered by Lenin as "premature and
counterproductive[." In addition, [technology]{.mark} "in its capitalist
guise" **[created]{.mark} [material expectations]{.mark}** [that]{.mark}
[induced]{.mark} Soviet leaders and those of other [socialist countries
to "modify their priorities" and]{.mark} increased "their willingness to
[give private foreign capital **a major role**]{.mark} **in their
economies**." As eco-Marxists would be the first to point out, the need
to transcend the logic of "infinite growth" inherent in capitalism has
been made urgent as a result of environmental imperatives]{.underline}.
In the case of the USSR, according to Wallis, the contradictions
continued until the last years of Soviet rule with the liberalization
strategy referred to as glasnost.5

[[What about **'degrowth'**]{.mark} -- shrinking the economy --
instead]{.underline}? This argument hinges on the fact that,
historically, economic growth has been linked with more
resource-intensive lifestyles. As we got richer, we used more energy
from fossil fuels, had a higher carbon footprint, used more land and ate
more meat. [And it's true that in a world [without
**tech**]{.mark}**nological [change]{.mark}**[, we'll be stuck with
fossil fuel]{.mark} power, petrol cars and inefficient
homes]{.underline}. But as the chapters that follow will show, [**[new
tech]{.mark}**nologies are **[allow]{.mark}ing [us to decouple]{.mark}**
a good and comfortable life from an environmentally destructive
one.]{.underline} This is what makes it possible for us to be the first
generation. In rich countries carbon emissions, energy use,
deforestation, fertiliser use, overfishing, plastic pollution, air
pollution and water pollution are all falling, while these countries
continue to get richer. [[The idea]{.mark} that these [countries were
more sustainable]{.mark} [when]{.mark} [they were poorer]{.mark} is
simply not true. There is another important reason why degrowth will not
build a sustainable future.]{.underline} Degrowth argues that we can
redistribute the world's wealth from the rich to the poor, giving
everyone a good and high standard of living with the resources already
at our disposal. But [the maths doesn't check out.20 The world is far
too poor to give everyone a high standard of living today through
redistribution alone.]{.underline} We can see this with a quick thought
experiment. Let's imagine that every country in the world ends up like
Denmark. Almost all its population lives above the \$30 poverty line
that most rich countries adopt, and it is one of the most equal
countries in the world.21 That's what I want: everyone in the world to
live a comfortable, poverty-free life, and in a society with low levels
of inequality. In this scenario, we're going to do a global
redistribution: all the countries that are richer than Denmark are
brought down to its average level of income, and all the countries that
are poorer -- which is 85% of the global population -- are brought up to
it[. There are no inequalities between countries, and
**[inequalities]{.mark}** within countries are also [**shrunk**
massively. Would it be possible]{.mark} to achieve this [by]{.mark} just
[redistributing]{.mark} the world's [money? **No**]{.mark}: the global
economy would have to be at least five times bigger than it is today.
That's right: [to lift everyone out]{.mark} of poverty]{.underline},
with a level of equality like Denmark, [**[the]{.mark} global
[econ]{.mark}omy** [would need to increase
five-fold]{.mark}.]{.underline} If everyone in the world lived on \$30
per day with zero inequality (so the richest and poorest both get \$30),
the global economy would need to more than double. [A world without
economic growth would remain a very poor one.]{.underline} I'm agnostic
about growth in rich [countries, but the data is clear that **[we
need]{.mark} strong [econ]{.mark}omic [growth]{.mark}** globally **[to
end]{.mark} [poverty]{.mark}**, even with lots of redistribution.
Historically, countries have become rich from fossil fuels and other
resources. That means many people now assume that [growth]{.mark} equals
'bad'. But there is no reason for it to stay that way]{.underline}. If a
country, or an individual for that matter, [[can lead the way in]{.mark}
providing a [cheap, low-carbon energy]{.mark} source that could power
the world, I would be more than happy for them to get rich from it.
A]{.underline}nd they could. [There is a massive 'solutions vacuum' for
our environmental problems.]{.underline} The early movers in this space
can build a prosperous economy while building solutions to our problems
at the same time. [[Countries can 'grow' by leading the way on '**good'
tech**]{.mark}nologies, not just exploiting polluting ones. This leads
to another argument, which is that having money gives us options. The
solutions and [tech]{.mark}nologies [we need to fix]{.mark} our
environmental problems have become [viable]{.mark} only [in the]{.mark}
[last few decades]{.mark}. Some, such as solar energy and electric
vehicles, only in the last few years.]{.underline} Before then, these
technologies did not exist or were far too expensive. [They've become
competitive through years of investment and development]{.underline} --
and that has needed extra cash from governments and entrepreneurs. For
hundreds of thousands of years, burning wood was the only source of
'controllable' heat and light that our ancestors had. Then, a few
centuries ago, our ancestors acquired a couple more -- albeit
destructive -- options: whale oil and coal. But we've only had real
choice in the last few years. [Economic growth is not incompatible with
reducing our environmental impact.]{.underline} In this book I'll show
that [[we can reduce our **enviro**]{.mark}**nmental [impact]{.mark}**
[and **reverse**]{.mark} our **[past damage]{.mark}** while becoming
better off]{.underline}. The big [question here is whether we can
decouple these impacts fast enough.]{.underline} The answer to that
depends on what actions we take today. We've seen how dramatically
things have improved for humanity when it comes to the first half of the
sustainability equation. And that neither depopulation nor degrowth,
despite their many advocates, are the solution to the second half. In
fact, they would make both the first and the second half of the equation
worse. What should we do instead? It's now time to explore our seven
environmental problems one by one and see what we need to do to solve
them.

Amid the French protests of May 1968, the idea of degrowth was born
under the name décroissance. It quickly gained traction in Parisian
Marxist circles with work from the likes of Austrian French philosopher
André Gorz and others. When in 1972 the Club of Rome published The
Limits to Growth, the term décroissance came to the mainstream.

Today décroissance is having another moment, this time under its English
moniker, as degrowth enters both policy circles and popular discourse.
[[It is,]{.mark} however, [a distraction for]{.mark} left [climate
movemen]{.mark}ts, one that we can ill afford when the world has such
limited time to decarbonize.]{.underline}

[[Degrowth provides **neither**]{.mark} [empirically grounded,]{.mark}
[actionable solutions nor a credible **theory of social**]{.mark} **and
[political]{.mark}** change. [It suffers from **four big
problems**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

**[[1.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Degrowth often confuses [correlation for
causation and overextrapolates from the past.]{.underline}

[The [strength of]{.mark} the [degrowth]{.mark} movement [comes
from]{.mark} accurately **[recounting how wealthy countries]{.mark}**
[developed]{.mark} [through]{.mark} the use of [fossil
fuels]{.mark}.]{.underline} Fossil fuels and economies coevolved
together: coal powered the earliest factories in the Industrial
Revolution. Electricity then lit, connected, and expanded cities around
the world. Oil and gas knit the post--World War II world economy
together.

[Economic [growth]{.mark}, then, [went]{.mark} hand in hand
[with]{.mark} the growth of [emissions]{.mark}. The degrowth movement
argues that while switching to green growth may be theoretically
possible, sufficiently rapid decarbonization requires
degrowth.]{.underline}

[The focus on growth, however, may lead to confusing correlation for
causation, and at worst distorting our policy priorities.]{.underline}
Therefore, an elementary reminder is in order: [[carbon **emissions**
come **from**]{.mark} burning carbon --- they are **[CO2]{.mark}**
emissions, [**not GDP** emissions]{.mark}. [To decarbonize, we need to
replace]{.mark} [carbon]{.mark} energy sources [with clean
energy]{.mark}, and [repressing]{.mark} [growth will not solve]{.mark}
the problem of financing electrification and [energy-]{.mark}input
[replacement]{.mark}.]{.underline}

This point may seem obvious, but many [people seem to forget it and
focus too narrowly on economic growth and GDP (which is of course a
controversial indicator of well-being).]{.underline} Growth is
contingent upon energy input, but that energy does not need to come from
carbon. [Those who argue that decoupling emissions from GDP cannot
happen fast enough are extrapolating from the historic association of
emissions and growth.]{.underline} If historical trends routinely and
straightforwardly predicted our economic future, then much of the risk
that we know to be endemic to the stock market and the financial sector
would not exist, as the past would be a sure guide to what's coming
next.

[[**2.** Degrowth doesn't]{.mark} acknowledge that
**[redistribution]{.mark} can [drive growth]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[Degrowth requires political suppression of consumption and
production.]{.underline} To offset the massive income reductions this
would entail for poorer populations, [many degrowth [experts
argue]{.mark} that this [decrease in]{.mark} [production]{.mark} and
consumption [should be accompanied by]{.mark} wealth
[redistribution]{.mark}.]{.underline}

At first glance, that proposal looks reasonable --- we can decrease
emissions and inequality at the same time. [But simultaneously reducing
growth and redistributing resources is not so simple.
[Redistribution]{.mark} [to]{.mark} lower income groups or [populations
who have a **higher propensity to spend**]{.mark} can actually
[increase]{.mark} household consumption, which all other things equal
may in turn increase **[emissions]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Redistribution is a worthy goal, but on its own it will not decarbonize
the economy.

[Redistribution is a worthy goal, but on its own it will not decarbonize
the economy]{.underline}. Some nuanced degrowth writing focuses loss
prescriptions on wealthier residents within rich countries and rich
countries overall. This is sensible, [but [it ignores]{.mark} the
[emissions that]{.mark} are likely to [come with]{.mark}
**[e]{.mark}**merging **[m]{.mark}**arket **[e]{.mark}**conomy (EME)
development in [countries]{.mark} like India. It also ignores the recoil
of investment in EMEs that would result from reductions in consumption
and growth in wealthy countries, which would tend to bring excess
capital back home to the richer countries.]{.underline}

Degrowth advocates might argue that [these [**problems** could be
**addressed** through]{.mark} national and [global]{.mark} planning
[regimes]{.mark}, [which]{.mark} could (e.g.) [restrain
households]{.mark} from increasing consumption too much and force
capital to invest more in poorer countries]{.underline}. But [the kind
of state [planning required to mitigate]{.mark} [emissions and regulate
behavior]{.mark} while reducing overall production and consumption
[would need to be]{.mark} a globally [coercive]{.mark} regime, with
otherworldly institutional capacities and knowledge]{.underline}.
Imagine the surveillance and punishment apparatuses needed to constantly
monitor people around the world to enforce production and consumption
quotas. [**[Few would]{.mark} voluntarily [agree to this
system]{.mark}**; governments now are not even following through on
relatively modest climate accords.]{.underline} Maybe a sacrifice of
democratic governance would be worth it, as some have argued[. But even
if an authoritarian regime of global planning were justified, what
social forces would have the capacity to institute one?]{.underline}

[To be clear, this isn't an objection to planning per se. To address the
climate crisis, we clearly need a big dose of democratic economic
planning that prioritizes ecological goals over profit.]{.underline} But
large-scale planning becomes both more technically and morally fraught
when it involves forcing most of the world's population to accept lower
living standards.

Historically[, industrial transformations have required growth, and
relatively lower growth in the context of such transformations has led
to horrific casualties]{.underline} (e.g., the Soviet Union's creation
of famine in Ukraine during its industrialization drive in the early
1930s). [[**Lower growth** means]{.mark} more [trade-offs and]{.mark}
[losses in]{.mark} a transition, meaning that new capital formation
comes at the cost of greater suppression of consumption and thus of
**[living standards.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

This is because the new capital needed to transition has to come from
somewhere. It can come from reallocating resources from traditional
growth sectors (e.g., from agriculture to industry) or from a rising
tide of growth that can improve the living standards of the majority.
Therefore, a global investment boom is necessary to pay for
decarbonization --- not a decline in investment, as many degrowth
advocates claim.

[[**3.** Degrowth adopts]{.mark} unjustified [assumptions]{.mark} [from
ortho]{.mark}dox [economics]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Degrowth has a lot in common with carbon-tax [advocacy. Carbon-tax
supporters, like degrowthers, have advocated decreases in consumption as
the way to decarbonization]{.underline}.

A global investment boom is necessary to pay for decarbonization --- not
a decline in investment, as many degrowth advocates claim.

This approach has not gone well historically. [The French
[gov]{.mark}ernment [imposed carbon taxes without]{.mark} offering
adequate [substitutes]{.mark} for citizens (such as affordable electric
vehicless or sufficient public transportation options); as a result,
[living costs increased]{.mark} for lower-income households who spent
larger shares of their budgets on energy, [and]{.mark} eventually
widespread social [unrest resulted]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The truth is that [a narrow emphasis on reducing consumption is deeply
rooted in orthodox economics.]{.underline} An orthodox economics
perspective would claim that we must decrease consumption to decrease
emissions. [This outlook tries to predict the future by holding
variables in the present constant. It assumes that resources and worker
productivity are always being maximized and also that energy unit costs
will not decrease.]{.underline}

[Those are false assumptions: resource utilization, productivity, and
energy costs change a great deal.]{.underline} Resource utilization can
become more efficient over time; think about how small computers have
become since the 1980s thanks to increasingly powerful microchips.
[Productivity and efficiency constantly vary. Why else would firms share
information and techniques with each other in order to improve
themselves on those measures? And energy costs can also decrease ---
look at the recent collapse in the price of solar.]{.underline}

This means that [decarbonization through decreased consumption may not
be necessary]{.underline}. In fact, carrots (economic gains) have had
more political success historically than sticks (economic losses) when
implementing climate policies.

[[Decarbonization will]{.mark} likely [require]{.mark} massive
investment. By the most sophisticated measures, global decarbonization
will cost roughly **[\$4 trillion per annum]{.mark},** and some version
of state-led green growth is probably our best route.]{.underline} Such
investment on a smaller scale is already increasing the availability of
carbon-free substitutes in the United States and China[. Degrowthers
often focus too much on economic suppression when we need to acknowledge
that electrification, [**energy replacement**, and econ]{.mark}omic
[justice]{.mark} may **[require one last]{.mark} economic
[boom]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[[**4.** Degrowth **doesn't**]{.mark} [have]{.mark} an adequate theory
of **[political]{.mark} [transformation.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

From the radical social reorganization of the Paris Commune to the
policy outcomes that followed the civil rights movement, historians and
social scientists have studied the conditions that lead to successful
political transformation. [To explain movement strengths or weaknesses
and predict or evaluate movement successes and failures, many
[scholars]{.mark} will plug a movement into what they [call a]{.mark}
"[political]{.mark} opportunity [structure]{.mark}." A political
opportunity structure has three components: [(1) public]{.mark}
[consciousness]{.mark}, [(2) organizational]{.mark} or
[mobilizing]{.mark} strength, and ([3)]{.mark} macro [political
opportunities.]{.mark}]{.underline}

What is the political opportunity structure of the degrowth movement?
[Despite academic chatter, the degrowth movement is irrelevant to most
people in the world. To get a pulse of public opinion, I compared Google
searches of "degrowth" versus "how to get rich."]{.underline}

[Google searches for "degrowth" versus "how to get rich."]{.underline}
Note: On y-axis, the value of 100 indicates peak popularity. Explore
more here. The recent peak in "how to get rich" searches represents the
Netflix release of a show under that name.

Not only do most people prioritize growth and prosperity over addressing
climate change (as discussed throughout), but most people also do not
know or care about degrowth. The degrowth movement fails in the arena of
public consciousness in both opinion and salience.

[Things look even more dire when examining other aspects of the
movement's political opportunity structure. There is no major social
movement organization or institution centering degrowth in its platform.
If such organizations do exist, they have feeble resources and
networks,]{.underline} which are key ingredients for movement success.
[The [**civil rights** movement]{.mark}, for instance, [boasted]{.mark}
black **[colleges]{.mark}**, **[churches]{.mark}**, and activist
**[organizations]{.mark}**]{.underline} (the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People, the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, and the
Congress of Racial Equality) tied together through strong networks and
alliances. [[Degrowth has **no**]{.mark} **natural
[constituency]{.mark},** and [creating it would require a global-scale
**transformation of political**]{.mark}
**[consciousness]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

Finally, [the [macro]{.mark} [political conditions to support the
movement are not present]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} There are [no
political regimes interested in advancing the movement.]{.underline} Not
even the European Union, arguably the international bloc most committed
to decarbonization right now, is interested in degrowth[. At the "Beyond
Growth" Conference, **[E]{.mark}uropean [C]{.mark}ommission** president
Ursula Von der Leyen stated, "A growth model centered on fossil fuels is
simply obsolete" and [called for]{.mark} "a different growth model that
is sustainable far into the future." She's talking about [green growth,
not degrowth]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Not even the European Union, arguably the international bloc most
committed to decarbonization right now, is interested in degrowth.

Furthermore, studies find again and again that [[democracies]{.mark}
[prioritize]{.mark} [econ]{.mark}omic [prosperity]{.mark} over real
decarbonization]{.underline}. Economic growth can enhance people's
quality of life (barring wars, or the trend of wealth concentration
outpacing growth that Thomas Piketty has documented). [National
**[governments]{.mark}** **are [legitimized by growth]{.mark}**, and
when they fail to provide it, there are political
consequences.]{.underline}

If economic stagnation often leads to explosions of anger at the status
quo in wealthy countries, imagine how emerging market economies will
deal with forced degrowth (those countries' growth rates in the coming
years are projected to dwarf those of advanced market economies). It is
hard to believe that emerging economies will accept nondevelopment for
the sake of climate goals. (No wonder social scientists in BRICS and
non-OECD countries favor green growth over degrowth.)

Degrowthers might reasonably retort that proponents of green growth
policies also lack the public consciousness, organizational or
mobilizing strength, and macro political opportunities to win meaningful
change[. The difference is that the vast majority of society has an
interest in an egalitarian green growth agenda along the lines of the
Green New Deal, because they stand to benefit from a massive public
investment in green jobs, infrastructure, and public transportation that
would raise their standard of living. And organized workers in strategic
sectors like electricity and auto have the structural leverage to win
key climate demands.]{.underline}

In other words, the broader climate movement has a potential coalition
with the interests and capacity to achieve its goals --- but it still
needs to be organized. That means a green growth program has a plausible
potential "political opportunity structure," unlike degrowth.

What's at Stake?

Despite degrowth's unclear prospects of achieving decarbonization and
lack of a plausible popular constituency, many smart people have been
distracted by it[. Instead of trying to convince everyone that we need
to fight economic growth, [there are more]{.mark} immediate
[practical]{.mark} [problems]{.mark} that those who want a green
transition need to attend to. To name a few:]{.underline}

### Transition\-\--AT: Degrowth\-\--1AR

Today décroissance is having another moment, this time under its English
moniker, [[as **degrowth** enters]{.mark} both [policy circles]{.mark}
and **popular discourse**]{.underline}. It is, however, [[**a
distraction** for **left climate movements**]{.mark}, one that we can
ill afford when the world has such limited time to
decarbonize.]{.underline}

Degrowth provides neither empirically grounded, actionable solutions nor
a credible theory of social and political change. It suffers from four
big problems.

[1. [Degrowth often confuses **correlation** for **causation** and
**overextrapolates** from the past.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The [strength of the degrowth movement comes from **accurately
recounting** how wealthy countries developed through the use of **fossil
fuels.**]{.underline} Fossil fuels and economies coevolved together:
coal powered the earliest factories in the Industrial Revolution.
Electricity then lit, connected, and expanded cities around the world.
Oil and gas knit the post--World War II world economy together.

[**[Economic growth]{.mark}**, then, [went **hand in hand** with]{.mark}
the **[growth of emissions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
[[degrowth]{.mark} movement [argues that while]{.mark} switching to
[**green growth** may be **theoretically p**ossible]{.mark},
sufficiently **rapid [decarbonization ]{.mark}**[requires
degrowth]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The [focus on growth]{.mark}, however, [may lead to **confusing**
**correlation** for **causation**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and at worst
distorting our policy priorities. Therefore, an elementary reminder is
in order: [[**carbon emissions** come from **burning
carbon**]{.underline}]{.mark} [--- they are **[CO2
emissions]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [not **GDP
emissions**]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} To [**decarbonize**, we
need to **replace carbon energy** sources with clean energy, and
[**repressing growth** **will not solve** the
problem]{.mark}]{.underline} of financing electrification and
energy-input replacement.

[This point may seem obvious, but [many people]{.mark} seem to forget it
and [**focus too narrowly** on]{.mark} economic growth and

Ending austerity in wealthy countries. Rich countries can afford
decarbonization already. But they have been stymied by neoliberal
ideologies and policy approaches that have prevented them from using the
power of the state and public investment to transform their economies.

Compensating losers in the transition. Households with higher energy
costs and workers and regions reliant on carbon-intensive industries
will need support, in the form of welfare programs, job training, and so
on as economies transition away from fossil fuels.

Moreover, this latter condition means that, [[after a **long
evolution**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [the [**emergent** economic
relations]{.mark}]{.underline} and their institutional partisans [[will
have access to so many **resources**]{.mark} that [they will]{.mark} be
able to **[triumph]{.mark}**]{.underline} economically and politically
[[over]{.mark} the [reactionary **partisans**]{.mark}]{.underline} of
the old, deteriorating economy. This, of course, is what
[[ultimately]{.mark} [**ensured** the political success of the
**bourgeoisie**]{.mark}]{.underline} in its confrontations [with the
**feudal aristocracy**]{.underline}. Likewise, one can predict that [if
capitalism continues to **stagnate**]{.underline} [and experience
**massive crisis**]{.underline} over the next fifty years and more, a
new, [more **cooperative**]{.underline} and socialized [mode of
production]{.underline} that has developed in the interstices [and
eventually the **mainstream** of capitalist society will **mount** the
summits of **political power**]{.underline}.

In short, my seemingly minor [conceptual revision provides a
**condition** for]{.underline} the [success of **anti-capitalist**
revolution]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} thus helps [[explain why no
such **revolution**]{.underline}]{.mark} so far [[has been
**successful**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the long run (namely because the
condition has been absent). Another way of seeing its implications and
advantages is by contrasting it with the views of orthodox Marxists. A
single sentence from Friedrich Engels sums up these views: "[[The
**proletariat** seizes state power]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and]{.mark}
then **[transforms]{.mark}** the means of [production into **state
property**]{.mark}]{.underline}."\[4\] This statement, approved by Lenin
and apparently also by Marx, encapsulates the ultra-statist perspective
of the orthodox Marxist theory.

This perspective is briefly expressed in the Communist Manifesto, where
Marx writes, "The proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest,
by degree, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralize all
instruments of production in the hands of the State, i.e., of the
proletariat organized as the ruling class," and then lays out a
ten-point plan of social reconstruction by means of state decrees. By
the 1870s Marx had abandoned the specifics of his earlier plan, but his
(qualified) statism remained, and transmitted itself to his
followers.\[5\] It is true that orthodox Marxists and Leninists expect
the state, "as a state," to somehow (inexplicably) wither away
eventually, but they do have a statist point of view in relation to the
early stages of revolution.

[The **statist** vision]{.underline} emerges naturally from Marx's
famous passage quoted above, [in that the idea of a [**conflict**
between]{.mark}]{.underline} the rational use and development of
[**productive [forces]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the fettering nature of
current **production [relations]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[suggests]{.underline}]{.mark} that at some point [[a
social]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[explosion]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [will
occur]{.underline} whereby the productive forces are finally liberated
from the chains of the irrational mode of production. Pressure builds
up, so to speak, over many years, as the mode of production keeps
fettering the socially rational use of technology and scientific
knowledge; through the agency of the working class, the productive
forces struggle against the shackles of economic relations; at long last
they burst free, when the working class takes over the state and
reorganizes the economy. These are the metaphors naturally conjured by
Marx's above-quoted Preface.

[But there are **logical** and **historical** problems with the
**statist** view]{.underline}, the view according to which the substance
of social revolution occurs after the seizure of state power. First of
all, [it is in **tension** with the [Marxian conception of **social
dynamics**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Briefly stated, Marx [[sees
the]{.underline} **[economy]{.underline}**]{.mark}---rightly, I
think---[[as]{.underline}]{.mark} [the **relative [foundation]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} the rest of [society]{.mark}]{.underline}, including the
political sphere, [which [suggests]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[a
**post-capitalist** social revolution cannot]{.mark} just [be
**politically**]{.mark} **willed**]{.underline} [and
**[imposed]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This would]{.underline} seem to
**[reverse]{.underline}** the order of "**[dominant
causality]{.underline}**," from government to the economy rather than
vice versa. Moreover, such extreme statism exalts will as determining
human affairs, a notion incompatible with the dialectical spirit of
Marxism.

According to "dialectics," history really happens "behind the backs" of
actors: it evolves "unconsciously," so to speak, as Hegel understood.
Social and institutional conflicts work themselves out, slowly, through
the actions of large numbers of people who generally have little idea of
the true historical significance of their acts. As Marx said, we should
never trust the self-interpretations of historical actors. And yet he
apparently suspends this injunction, and his whole dialectical method,
when it comes to the so-called proletarian revolution. These historical
actors are somehow supposed to have perfect understanding of themselves
and their place in history, and their historical designs are supposed to
work out perfectly and straightforwardly---despite the massive
complexity and "dialectical contradictions" of society.

The reality is that [[if]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[the **working
class**]{.underline}]{.mark}" (not an undifferentiated unity) or its
ostensible representatives [[seize **control** of the
state]{.underline}]{.mark} (whether violently or electorally) [in a
**still-wholly-capitalist society**]{.underline}---[[and]{.mark}
if]{.underline}, [[miraculously]{.underline}]{.mark}, [they are [not
**crushed** by]{.mark} the forces of
**[reaction]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[[they can expect to face
**overwhelming obstacles** to]{.mark} the realization of [their
revolutionary **plans**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, there will be
[[**divisions** among]{.mark} the [new **ruling
elite**]{.mark}]{.underline}, divisions [**[within]{.mark}** the
[working class **itself**]{.mark}]{.underline}, widespread
**[[resistance]{.underline}]{.mark}** to plans [[to]{.mark} **remake**
the [economy]{.mark}]{.underline}, the [[necessity for]{.mark} brutal
[**authoritarian** methods]{.mark} of **rule**]{.underline} in order to
force people to accept the new government's plans, [the [**inevitable**
creation of]{.mark} a **[large bureaucracy]{.mark}**]{.underline} to
carry out so-called reconstruction, etc.

Fundamental to all these obstacles is the fact that the
[[**revolutionaries** have to contend with]{.mark} the [institutional
legacies of **capitalism**]{.mark}]{.underline}: relations of
[[coercion]{.mark} and domination [**condition** everything the
government does]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and [there is no way to **break
free**]{.mark}]{.underline} of them. They cannot be magically
transcended through political will. In particular, it is impossible
through top-down directives to transform production relations from
authoritarian to democratic: Marxism itself suggests that the state is
not socially creative in such a radical way. The hope to reorganize
exploitative relations of production into emancipatory, democratic
relations by means of bureaucracy and the exercise of a unitary
political will is utterly utopian and un-Marxist.

The record of so-called Communist revolutions in the twentieth century
is instructive. While some Marxists may deny that lessons should be
drawn from these revolutions, since they happened in relatively
"primitive" rather than advanced capitalist countries, the experiences
are at least suggestive. For what they created in their respective
societies was not socialism (workers' democratic control of production)
or communism (a classless, stateless, moneyless society of anarchistic
democracy) but a kind of ultra-statist state capitalism.

To quote the economist Richard Wolff, "the internal organization of the
vast majority of industrial enterprises \[in Communist countries\]
remained capitalist. The productive workers continued in all cases to
produce surpluses: they added more in value by their labor than what
they received in return for that labor. Their surpluses were in all
cases appropriated and distributed by others."\[6\] Workers continued to
be exploited and oppressed, as in capitalism; the accumulation of
"capital," in a sense, continued to be the overriding systemic
imperative, to which human needs were subordinated. While there are
specific historical reasons for the way these economies developed, the
general underlying condition was that it was and is impossible to
transcend the capitalist framework if the political revolution takes
place in a capitalist world, ultimately because the economy dominates
politics more than political will can dominate the economy.

In any case, it was and is breathtakingly utopian to think that an
attempted seizing of the state in an advanced and still overwhelmingly
capitalist country, however crisis-ridden its economy, could ever
succeed, because [[the ruling class has a **monopoly** over]{.mark} the
most **sophisticated** and [**destructive** means of violence]{.mark}
available in the world]{.underline}. Even rebellions in relatively
peripheral countries have almost always been crushed, first because the
ruling classes there had disproportionate access to means of violence,
and second because the ruling classes in more advanced countries could
send their even more sophisticated instruments of warfare to these
countries in order to put down the revolution. But [[if a **mass
rebellion** came close]{.mark} to **overthrowing** the
regime]{.underline} of one of the core capitalist nations, as opposed to
a peripheral one, [the **[reaction]{.mark}** of ruling classes
[worldwide would be]{.mark} nearly
**[apocalyptic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [They would likely
[prefer]{.mark} the [**nuclear destruction** of civilization to]{.mark}
permitting the working class]{.underline} or some subsection of it [to
**take over**]{.underline} a central capitalist country.

Thus, [[the only **possible** way]{.underline}]{.mark}---and the only
Marxist way---[for a **transition** out of capitalism]{.underline} to
occur [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} that it [be [grounded
in]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and **organized** on the basis
of]{.underline}, the new, gradually and widely [[emerging **production
relations** themselves]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is the condition that
has been absent in all attempts at revolution so far, and it explains
why, aside from a few isolated pockets of [[**momentary**
socialism]{.underline}]{.mark} (such as, perhaps, Catalonia in
1936),\[7\] they [[never managed to **transcend**]{.mark} a kind of
**[state capitalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They existed in a capitalist
world, so they were constrained by the limits of that world.

### Alt Fails\-\--AT: Socialism\-\--2AC

#### Socialist alternatives fail to account for the history of socialism---even if it's good in theory, it always fails in practice. 

Kristian **Niemietz '20**, PhD in Political Economy from King's College
London and Head of Health and Welfare at the Institute of Economic
Affairs, 3/16/20, "Socialism: The Failed Idea That Never Dies,"
https://www.forbes.com/sites/rainerzitelmann/2020/03/16/socialism-the-failed-idea-that-never-dies/
accessed 7/22/25 // mrucka

Why have socialist ideas become so attractive again, despite the fact
that, without exception, [every socialist experiment over the past 100
years has ended in dismal failure]{.underline}? In this interview,
Kristian Niemietz, author of *Socialism. The Failed Idea That Never
Dies* and Head of Political Economy at the Institute for Economic
Affairs London, has the answers.

More Than Two Dozen Failed Experiments

Rainer Zitelmann: In your book, you write that socialism has always
failed. Looking back through human history, are there really no examples
of socialist systems that have actually worked?

Kristian Niemietz: No. [Over the past hundred years, there have been
more than [**two dozen** attempts to build a socialist
society]{.mark}.]{.underline} It has been tried in the Soviet Union,
Yugoslavia, Albania, Poland, Vietnam, Bulgaria, Romania, Czechoslovakia,
North Korea, Hungary, China, East Germany, Cuba, Tanzania, Laos, South
Yemen, Somalia, the Congo, Ethiopia, Cambodia, Mozambique, Angola,
Nicaragua and Venezuela, among others---[not counting the very
short-lived ones.]{.underline} [**[All]{.mark}** of these attempts have
[ended in]{.mark} varying degrees of **[failure]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Zitelmann: How can an idea that has failed so many times, in so many
different variants and in so many radically different settings, still be
so popular? After all, one of the remaining candidates for the
presidential nomination in the United States is a self-avowed socialist.

Niemietz: Indeed, and organizations such as the Democratic Socialists of
America (DSA) have been experiencing a huge influx of new
members---predominantly young people---over the past five years or so.
The organization has not just become much larger, but also much younger:
the median age among its members has dropped from 68 years to 33 years.
Socialism has become a young people's movement. Socialism has become hip
and trendy.

[[Socialists have]{.mark} successfully [managed to **distance**
themselves from]{.mark} **all [real-world examples]{.mark}** [of
**failed**]{.mark} socialist [experiments]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[Whenever you confront socialists with any such example, they always
offer the following response:]{.underline} ["These examples don't prove
anything at all!]{.underline} None of these models were ever truly
socialist. This is a straw man. You just don't understand socialism."

Zitelmann: And isn't it interesting that [you only ever hear such
pronouncements once a **socialist experiment** has quite **obviously
failed**]{.underline}? In the early days of any new socialist
experiment, it is enthusiastically greeted by huge numbers of
intellectuals.

Niemietz: Precisely. This has happened many times. The most recent
example is Venezuela, which, just a few years ago, was being hailed by
leading intellectuals and left-wing politicians as a model for
"Socialism of the 21st Century." One leading left-wing intellectual, the
Princeton Professor Cornell West, proclaimed: "I love that Hugo Chávez
has made poverty a major priority. I wish America would make poverty a
priority." And the high-profile journalist Barbara Walters enthused: "He
cares very much about poverty, he is a socialist. What he's trying to do
for all of Latin America, they have been trying to do for years,
eliminate poverty. But he is not the crazy man we've heard... This is a
very intelligent man." From Noam Chomsky to Naomi Klein---all the
fashionable intellectuals were at it.

Now that the failure of Venezuela's socialist experiment is obvious to
all and sundry, left-wing intellectuals scramble for excuses, coming up
with extremely convoluted ways of claiming that what we saw in Venezuela
was never "really" socialism at all.

Zitelmann: You also write that even mass murderers such as Josef Stalin
and Mao Zedong were enthusiastically celebrated by leading intellectuals
of their time. How widespread was this admiration for dictators like Mao
and Stalin among intellectuals?

Niemietz: It was very widespread. There were literally thousands of
Westerners who travelled to those places and returned full of praise.
Most of them did not leave written testimonies, but you can still easily
find hundreds of quotes from Western intellectuals who extolled Stalin
und Mao. More importantly, the people who did so were not outsiders. We
are not talking about the members of some obscure fringe party. We are
talking about well-established mainstream intellectuals, including some
of the most renowned writers and scholars of the time.

They were convinced that they saw a better society in the making. Even
the concentration camps in the Soviet Union and China, the Gulags and
Laogai, were admired: they were presented as places of rehabilitation,
not punishment, where inmates were given a chance to engage in useful
activities, while reflecting upon their mistakes. Even journalists and
intellectuals who didn't completely turn a blind eye to the regime's
crimes found arguments to justify what was happening: "But---to put it
brutally---you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs and the
Bolshevist leaders are just as indifferent to the casualties that may be
involved in their drive toward socialization as any General during the
World War who ordered a costly attack." Those were the famous words of
Walter Duranty, who was the New York Times' Moscow correspondent from
1922 to 1936.

When The Experiment Fails: 'That Was Never True Socialism'

Zitelmann: You say that [[every]{.mark} socialist [experiment]{.mark} to
date [has gone through]{.mark} **three [phases]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
What are these three phases?

Niemietz: During the first phase, [the [**honeymoon**
period]{.mark}]{.underline}, [intellectuals around the world are
**enthusiastic** about the system and praise it to the
heavens.]{.underline} [This]{.underline} enthusiasm [is]{.underline}
always followed by a second phase, [the "excuses-and-whataboutery
period," which sets in when the **system's failings** become more widely
known.]{.underline} During this phase, [intellectuals still uphold the
system, but their tone becomes **angry and defensive**]{.underline},
probably because they are suffering from **[[cognitive
dissonance]{.underline}]{.mark}**. They grudgingly admit some of the
system's deficiencies, but try to blame them on capitalist saboteurs,
foreign forces or boycotts by U.S. imperialists. Or they try to
relativize those failings by talking about unrelated bad things
happening elsewhere: "What about...?"

Finally, [the third phase sees intellectuals **deny** that it was ever
truly a **form of socialism**,]{.underline} the "not-real-socialism"
stage. This is the stage at which [intellectuals claim that the country
in question]{.underline}---for example the Soviet Union, Maoist China,
or now also Venezuela---[was [never "really]{.mark}" a
[socialist]{.mark} country.]{.underline}

Zitelmann: People who call themselves socialists today usually
acknowledge the fact that socialist experiments have failed in the past.
But [do they also draw the **right lessons** from these
failures]{.underline}?

Niemietz: **[Absolutely not]{.underline}**. [[Socialists who
**criticize**]{.underline}]{.mark} Stalinism and [other forms of
[real-world, historical socialism always **fail** to analyze the
**economic reasons** fo]{.mark}r the [failure]{.mark} of these
systems]{.underline}. [Their analyses attack the paucity of democratic
rights and freedoms in these systems, but the
**[alt]{.mark}ernative[s]{.mark}** they formulate [are based on a
**vague vision** of all-encompassing "democratization of the
economy]{.mark}" or "worker control."]{.underline} But these are exactly
the same principles that initially underpinned the failed socialist
systems in the Soviet Union and other countries. When contemporary
socialists talk about a non-autocratic, non-authoritarian, participatory
and humanitarian version of socialism, they are not being as original as
they think they are. That was *always* the idea. This is what socialists
have *always* said. It is not for a lack of trying that it has never
turned out that way.

Socialist projects do not start out with totalitarian aspirations---they
just end up that way. Lenin's 1917 manifesto "The State and Revolution"
does not at all read like a blueprint for a totalitarian society. It
reads like a blueprint for, to use the currently fashionable term,
"democratic socialism." [[Socialism is always democratic and
emancipatory in its aspirations, but **oppressive** and
**authoritarian** in its **actual practice**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Socialism fails economically AND it's unpopular.

*The Nation*, which enthusiastically has supported every totalitarian
communist regime that has existed in the past century (and that includes
Pol Pot's Cambodia and North Korea) is now firmly riding the Bernie
Sanders bandwagon. This article, entitled "Why American Socialism
Failed---and How It Could Prevail Today,"** **unwittingly gives away the
mentality of [American [socialists]{.mark}]{.underline} which
[[claim]{.underline}s]{.mark} [[all]{.mark} economic [issues as being
"**solved**" by]{.mark} the implantation of
**[socialism]{.mark}**---regardless of the actual economic
outcomes.]{.underline}

Three years ago, I wrote "The End of Socialists is Socialism, Not
Prosperity," and this article follows some of the same themes. In that
article, I argued that [socialists do not necessarily believe that
socialism produces better economic outcomes than
capitalism]{.underline}---indeed, [one would have to be **willfully
blind** to fail to recognize the differences]{.underline}---but that
[socialists believe it **doesn't matter**.]{.underline} [[Socialism is a
**moral imperative**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the only thing holding
back the implementation of this system in the USA has been the failure
of socialists to present a plausible alternative---something that
socialists claim now is being done.

People who follow the arguments based in Austrian economics are
intimately familiar with the [**economic calculation problem** of
socialism]{.underline} as laid out by Ludwig von Mises in 1920 and
Murray N. Rothbard on numerous occasions, as well as the secondary
"knowledge" argument presented by F. A. Hayek in 1945. Mises and
Rothbard presented what clearly are **[irrefutable claims]{.underline}**
that [[the **only** kind of socialist economy that could exist
would]{.mark} be a **[primitive]{.mark}**, **extremely basic** economy
that could not support any kind of complex economic
activity]{.underline}. Even a die-hard socialist like Robert Heilbroner
would admit to as much in his 1989 commentary in *The New Yorker*:

[[The **Soviet Union**]{.mark}, **[China]{.mark}** & **[Eastern
Europe]{.mark}** have [give]{.mark}n [us]{.mark} the [clear]{.mark}est
possible [**proof** that **capitalism** organizes]{.mark} the material
[affairs of humankind **more satisfactorily** than
socialism]{.mark}]{.underline}: that [[however inequitably]{.mark} or
irresponsibly [the marketplace may distribute goods]{.mark}, [it does so
**better than**]{.mark} the queues of a **[planned
economy]{.mark}**]{.underline}....the great question now seems how rapid
will be the transformation of socialism into capitalism, & not the other
way around, as things looked only half a century ago. 

However, as I pointed out three years ago, the collapse of the USSR and
the eastern European socialist states did not "convert" Heilbroner to
becoming an advocate for capitalism, nor did China's transformation from
Mao's giant commune to a quasi-capitalist economy (and subsequent
economic growth) change his mind. Indeed, [[socialists]{.mark} seem
almost [**impervious** to **factual arguments**]{.mark},]{.underline}
and despite a gaggle of "what would a socialist economy look like"
articles in publications such as *Jacobin*, socialists have never
refuted the Austrian arguments. For that matter, [socialists really
[**cannot appeal to economics** at all despite their claim that their
goal is to provide a better economic society for]{.mark} those
ubiquitous [workers]{.mark}]{.underline}. *Jacobin* declares:

[For socialists, [establishing **popular confidence** in the
**feasibility** of a socialist society is now an **existential
challenge**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Without a renewed and grounded belief
in the possibility of the goal, [it's [**near impossible** to imagine
**reviving**]{.mark} **and sustaining** [the
project]{.mark}.]{.underline} This, it needs emphasis, isn't a matter
of *proving* that socialism is possible (the future can't be verified)
nor of laying out a thorough blueprint (as with projecting capitalism
before its arrival, such details can't be known), but of presenting a
framework that contributes to making the case for
socialism's *plausibility*.

(Note that the Jacobins are famous for unleashing the infamous Reign of
Terror during the French Revolution, in which thousands of so-called
enemies of the state were murdered. That American socialists today
willingly associate themselves with genocide speaks volumes of what
these people will do if they ever gain real power here.)

In other words, [the implementation of a socialist order is not so much
dependent upon a plausible model of a socialist economy, but rather is
an exercise that depends upon convincing people that somewhere over the
rainbow we can make the whole thing work, despite the failures of the
past.]{.underline} And that is where the recent articles in *The
Nation* and the *Daily Mail* reveal much about the socialist mentality.

Many Americans---particularly but not exclusively the young---remain
intrigued by socialism. Indeed, a 2019 survey found that socialism is as
popular as capitalism among young American adults. Well-known political
figures such as Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria
Ocasio-Cortez describe themselves as "democratic socialists" and
advocate tens of trillions of dollars in new spending programs along
with a massive expansion of state power over citizens' lives. In
academic circles, too, the debate surrounding the merits of socialism
continues.

A little less than thirty years after the Soviet Union was formally
dissolved, [[capitalism is]{.mark} nearly everywhere [on the
**defensive**]{.mark}]{.underline}, both in academia and in the realm of
public discourse. [Yet [no system offers **better opportunities** for
the downtrodden]{.mark} to **rise** and **improve their living
standards** than democratic capitalism.]{.underline}

The [socialism of the twentieth century]{.underline} was primarily
economic in orientation: it rejected capitalism and favored state
control over the economy. [Individuals had to **submit** to
**[central]{.mark} economic [planning]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
[Conceptually, this socialism [did not see individual]{.mark} human
beings [as having]{.mark} **inherent [dignity]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
[Instead, [it **divided** society into two **clashing**]{.mark},
competing **[classes]{.mark}**: [the]{.mark} group that was
[economically **oppressive**]{.mark} (the capitalists) [and the]{.mark}
group that were economically **[oppressed]{.mark}** (the
workers).]{.underline} In this worldview, [**[individualism]{.mark}** as
a concept [became]{.mark} not merely meaningless but
[suspect]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The neosocialism that I see taking root today also rejects capitalism
as a system]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}, just as in the socialism of
old, [[the individual and his own]{.mark} **moral [contributions are
devalued]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [What matters, once again, is the
group]{.underline} (the collective tribe) to which an individual
belongs. Again, [these collective groups are either oppressive or
oppressed, and [an individual's **moral worth** is determined by looking
at the **group**]{.mark} or groups to which he belongs.]{.underline}

Capitalism, with its emphasis on individualism, meritocracy, and
colorblindness, is not compatible with this worldview. Much of today's
debate is therefore being waged on grounds not of the efficiency or
inefficiency of capitalism but of capitalism's alleged immorality. One
of today's most influential public voices, Robin DiAngelo, author
of *White Fragility,* rejects capitalism as follows: "Capitalism is so
bound up with racism . . . capitalism is dependent on inequality, on an
underclass. If the model is profit over everything else, you're not
going to look at your policies to see what is most racially equitable."

I aim to defend the superiority of democratic capitalism over both the
old socialism and neosocialism---not only for its economic efficiency,
but also for its moral superiority and the possibilities it provides for
humans to flourish. I caution young Americans that before they embrace
neosocialism, they consider carefully not only its superficial
attractions but also its fundamental drawbacks. [Those who value
**individualism**, meritocracy, and **equality** of opportunity will
find these things in a **capitalist system**, as long as it provides
educational opportunities to all.]{.underline}

Memories of a Socialist Illusion

To me, socialism is more than just an academic concept. When I was
around six or seven years old, I lived in Mogadishu, Somalia, with my
mother. Much of her daily life consisted of standing in line for hours
on end to receive the daily ration of food allotted by the government.
At the time, the Somalian state, if one can call it that, had
implemented Marxist economics, to the extent that this was possible. To
every family the state apportioned a certain quantity of food: sugar,
flour, oil, and so on. In the government rations, there was hardly any
meat or eggs, as these were deemed to be luxury goods. A person received
what the authorities decided was strictly necessary, not what the person
wanted.

My first experience of socialism was, therefore, one of enduring long
lines in the hot sun, without shelters or panels to cover us. My mother
and grandmother felt a sense of bafflement, indignity, and powerlessness
as a result of this daily grind. In terms of power relationships, the
lines served an important function: they emphasized the powerlessness of
the individual and the power of the collective over even the smallest
food rations. The recipient had no control over what she would be
handed. You had to obey political authorities to receive anything at
all, however modest. This was the Marxist form of order---even if,
because of Somalia's pastoral traditions and low degree of
industrialization, rationing was dictated as much by the imperative to
limit food consumption as it was by "scientific socialism."

Scientific socialism as implemented by Somalia's government did not
result in equality and justice. On the contrary, [[it was the people
with the strongest **political connections**]{.mark} to the government
and to influential clans [who were most
**empowered**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[A system that claimed to **empower
the marginalized**]{.mark} and dispossessed [showed a]{.mark}n
astonishing [**lack of compassion** for]{.mark} precisely [the
**least-connected**]{.mark} people.]{.underline} [Somalia's communist
regime [**brutally repressed** dissidents]{.mark}, as did other
**authoritarian socialist regimes** of the twentieth
century.]{.underline} Yet in school, my fellow students and I sang songs
of praise for the system, surrounded by large pictures of Marx, Lenin,
and Siad Barre.

[Today this type of orthodox socialism still appears to have its
defenders,]{.underline} despite the fact that it failed in Somalia just
as it has failed more recently in Venezuela, a once-rich country now
engulfed in hunger and chaos because of similar pathologies of
corruption and inefficiency that arose inevitably from state control of
economic life.

Why Socialism Fails

Broadly speaking, *socialism* typically refers to the ownership of
things in common, rather than private ownership; it has been defined as
"a form of social organization that prioritizes the common ownership of
property and the collective control of economic production." Quite
optimistically, Michael Newman argues in *Socialism: A Very Short
Introduction* that "the most fundamental characteristic of socialism is
its commitment to the creation of an egalitarian society." Some early
socialists were more anarchist or individualist than others, but all
these thinkers favored a reorganization of society along what they
believed would be more equitable lines.

Generally, socialists of all persuasions share a critical view of
industrial capitalism and its emphasis on private property, but
socialists have differed (both in the nineteenth century and today) on
the proposed remedy. Therefore, as Roger Scruton reminds us, the work of
socialists is more frequently distinguished by its critique of
capitalism than by its detailed description of what socialism should
look like and how it should work. Among revolutionary socialists,
socialism as it existed in the Soviet Union is frequently theorized as a
transitional state, ultimately culminating in a communist utopia.

[**For decades**, theory aside, economic [socialism inflicted
**extraordinary misery** on **hundreds of millions of people**]{.mark}
in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics.]{.underline} The
puzzle confronting us in 2020 is [why, with so much empirical evidence
on the rise and fall of authoritarian socialism, there is even a
conversation on this topic]{.underline}, other than classroom
discussions meant to inform students about some of the darkest pages of
human history.

[Socialists lost the broad economic argument in the twentieth century
because **socialist systems**]{.underline} (command economies) [**did
not work**.]{.underline} Why? In a capitalist economy, market prices, in
a framework of private property, coordinate economic activity. Companies
use prices to see which goods, products, and services are needed and
where, at what time, and in what quantities. Firms compete, on the basis
of market prices, to deliver these goods as efficiently as possible.
Firms that miscalculate run the risk of bankruptcy. The most efficient
and competitive firms---those that best meet the needs of the
public---survive and thrive.

[In a [socialist system]{.mark},]{.underline} however, [there are [no
**market pricing signals**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [This [creates
**chaos**]{.mark} throughout the economy.]{.underline} Economists in the
West who participated in the "socialist calculation debate" of the 1920s
and 1930s, including Friedrich Hayek, predicted this **[crucial
flaw]{.underline}** in socialism theoretically before it became
painfully clear empirically. In a socialist system, unlike in a market
system, [[orders]{.mark} to produce [come from the top]{.mark},
frequently in the form of quotas.]{.underline} [Yet in the absence of a
market pricing mechanism to determine profit and loss, [**poorly
performing** organizations tend to **persist**]{.mark} under
socialism]{.underline}: there is no bankruptcy to cull them. [The
**[public good suffers]{.mark}** as a result.]{.underline} [Crucially,
in the absence of genuine private property, [there may be **little
incentive** to **work hard**]{.mark} if one cannot keep the fruits of
one's labor.]{.underline} [Why cultivate a field carefully if you cannot
benefit from the harvest?]{.underline}

Although socialism is capable of centrally driven technological
innovation, [in the [absence of market pricing]{.mark} signals a
socialist system [**cannot** distribute **technological** or
**scientific** blessings]{.mark} to the **mass of the people** [in a way
that **increases their living standards**]{.mark} in a sustained
way.]{.underline}

[[Socialist systems]{.mark} are command economies that [tell people to
**obey central economic plans**]{.mark}, even if they have other
ideas.]{.underline} Under socialism, you may wish to start a business,
or you may have an idea for a new technology---too bad. You must do as
you are told. Authoritarian socialism does not adapt to your wishes.
[Socialist economic planning [depend]{.mark}s [on **authoritarian
measures**]{.mark} to compel people to obey central
directives.]{.underline} [As a result, a "black economy" of smuggled
goods frequently arises]{.underline} to meet the real needs that the
central plan fails to fulfill.

**Human Activity in Motion**

[Unlike socialist societies]{.underline}, [[societies with **political
freedom**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [alongside a capitalist or free
enterprise system]{.underline} in the economic realm, [[have
a]{.underline}]{.mark} prodigious [**[capacity to
adapt]{.mark}**.]{.underline} A capitalist system is constantly in
motion to satisfy the wants and needs of millions of diverse
individuals. Every day a capitalist system balances trial and error to
evaluate new technologies, new ways of doing things, new ways of
improving technologies, and new ways of running businesses.

Because of competition, a business under capitalism survives only to the
extent it offers consumers a product they enjoy or need at a reasonable
price, whether cars, food, lumber, or clothing. And this is true even
for hospital systems and medical providers, which vie for the business
of patients for, say, safe and successful surgeries.

Under a system of crony capitalism, businesses may rely on improper
political connections to create cumbersome regulations that block
competition. However, in a country with a functioning rule of law, a
free press, and an informed public, and where corrupt officials are
prosecuted, intense scrutiny of such practices can mitigate this
systemic risk.

Pure laissez-faire capitalism is a thing of the past. In centuries past
during the early phases of industrialization there were indeed inhumane
working conditions, ones that should not be forgotten. People worked in
unsafe spaces. Over time, however, capitalist societies adapted and
introduced safety measures, sickness benefits, pensions, and other forms
of social insurance. New technologies reduced risks for workers. Social
reformers pressed political leaders to abolish child labor, and
universal education was introduced. The wealth created by the capitalist
system made these reforms easier to implement. Working conditions in
socialist countries were frequently more brutal, with fewer worker
protections and environmental safeguards.

Admittedly, nothing is perfect. In the capitalist economy today, there
are, for example, recurring questions surrounding working conditions in
sweatshop factories and warehouses as well as in the gig economy. That
is precisely where the agility and nimbleness of societies built on a
system of free enterprise come in: such societies are able to adapt, and
they do so.

### Alt Fails\-\--Socialism Unpopular 

#### Left politics are unpopular globally, latest election proves 

Emily **Crane,'25**,-, \"The Left is now more unpopular worldwide than

**[[Lefty]{.mark} political [parties]{.mark}]{.underline}** across the
world [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} now **[[more
unpopular]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[than any time]{.underline}]{.mark}
since the Cold War, a staggering [analysis of [recent elections
shows]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The [[Left suffered a **record-low average** of]{.mark} just [45% of
votes]{.mark} in dozens of ballots [held globally]{.mark}]{.underline}
last year, [according to]{.underline} the [analysis o[f 73 democratic
elections]{.mark}]{.underline}, [conducted by the
Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/01/16/left-unpopular-right-wing-triumphs-global-elections/).

[[In]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[U]{.mark}nited]{.underline}
[[S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark} [West]{.mark}ern
[Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[progressives were even more
**unpopular**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- with the left-leaning parties
[securing only 42% of]{.underline} their respective [votes]{.underline}.

The [[Right]{.underline}]{.mark}, meanwhile, [[won 57%
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the average [[votes]{.underline}]{.mark} ---
representing the widest gap since 1990, the analysis found.

The global demise of the political left comes off the back
of [President-elect Donald Trump's
landslide](https://www.aol.com/news/majority-americans-expect-trump-good-025238481.html) election
win.

Trump, who will be inaugurated on Monday, secured the popular vote with
77 million votes compared to the 75 million his Democratic rival, Vice
President Kamala Harris, raked in.

The [[Left's declining popularity]{.mark} [is]{.mark} only **[expected
to continue]{.mark}**,]{.underline} too, experts say.

In the wake of Harris' defeat, [[leftist parties in Canada, Australia,
and Germany]{.underline}]{.mark} [are already [predicted to suffer
similar losses]{.mark}]{.underline} in upcoming ballots.

"The trend is up. There is no real reason to expect that it will stop
anytime soon," Prof. Matthijs Rooduijn, a political scientist from the
University of Amsterdam, told the outlet.

In Canada, polls are already showing that its[ firebrand Conservative
leader](https://nypost.com/2025/01/07/world-news/who-is-pierre-poilievre-canadas-firebrand-conservative-leader-vying-to-become-next-prime-minister-after-justin-trudeaus-exit/) Pierre
Poilievre is the favorite to replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau after
the [lefty leader's abrupt
resignation](https://nypost.com/2025/01/06/world-news/canadian-prime-minister-justin-trudeau-resigns/) earlier
this month.

Meanwhile, Australia's conservative party has also inched ahead of its
ruling progressive government prior to a planned election later this
year, polls show.

[Experts have pinned the right's rising popularity, in part, on hardline
immigration policies in the US and parts of Europe.]{.underline}

Jeremy Cliffe, of the European Council on Foreign Relations think tank,
said three trends were also tied to the boost.

"The [[globalization-driven decline of organized labor, rising identity
politics harnessed more successfully by]{.mark} the [Right than]{.mark}
the [Left]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} a [general **tendency**]{.mark} [among
**Leftist forces to fragment rather than unite**]{.mark}," he
said.]{.underline}

#### Conservatism on the rise

News, Features, and Opinions, 4-5-2025
https://catalystmcgill.com/the-rise-of-conservatism-and-the-decline-of-liberalism-a-global-shift/,

An [[**ideological shift** is reshaping Western
democracies]{.underline}]{.mark}. This [[transformation]{.mark} is [not
limited]{.mark} [to]{.mark} electoral [politics]{.mark}]{.underline} but
[**[extends to broader changes in governance, social values, and
international relations]{.mark}**.]{.underline} While much of the focus
has been on Western nations, this shift has also influenced political
and economic developments in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. [Since the
end of the Cold War, [liberalism]{.mark} has been the dominant political
ideology in the West]{.underline}, advocating for individual freedoms,
free markets, secular governance, and globalization. However, [this
model now [faces significant challenges]{.mark}.]{.underline} Global
crises exposed [[deep flaws in neoliberal economic
policies]{.underline}]{.mark}, leading to [[widening]{.mark} wealth
[inequality]{.mark}]{.underline} and [[declining
trust]{.underline}]{.mark} in traditional institutions. [In
response]{.underline} to these growing frustrations, **[[conservative
movements]{.mark} have [[gained
traction]{.mark},](https://thechanzo.com/2024/11/10/the-death-of-liberalism-and-the-rise-of-conservatism-a-global-shift-and-its-implications-for-the-global-south/)]{.underline}** offering
alternatives that emphasize nationalism, economic protectionism, and
cultural preservation.

In the aftermath of the Cold War, liberal democracy and free-market
capitalism experienced significant [global
expansion](https://www.britannica.com/topic/democracy/The-spread-of-democracy-in-the-20th-century).
This period, often referred to as the "Third Wave of Democratization,"
saw numerous countries transitioning to democratic governance.
Simultaneously, [globalization
accelerated](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/does-globalization-promote-democracy-an-early-assessment/),
leading to increased economic interdependence among nations. The 2008
financial crisis [marked a critical
juncture](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/how-the-2008-financial-crisis-fuels-todays-populist-politics),
exposing vulnerabilities in neoliberal economic policies and leading to
widespread public disillusionment. This economic downturn discredited
longstanding market-driven policies, creating space for populist
alternatives. In the years following the financial crisis, there was a
notable [increase in nationalism and
populism](https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2020/number/1/article/the-great-recession-and-the-rise-of-populism.html).
Economic insecurity and cultural anxieties contributed to the growing
appeal of populist movements that challenged traditional liberal
institutions.

​ The [**global shift toward conservatism** stems from a confluence of
economic, cultural, and political factors]{.underline}.
Economically, [[[rising]{.mark} income
[inequality]{.mark}](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1718155115) [and]{.mark}
a [sense of marginalization]{.mark} among working-class populations have
[fueled]{.mark} a [backlash agains]{.mark}t established [liberal
policies]{.mark}]{.underline}. This sentiment significantly influenced
events such as Donald Trump's 2016 presidential victory and the United
Kingdom's Brexit referendum, where concerns over economic disparities
and national sovereignty were prominent.
Additionally[, [[anti-globalization
sentiments](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/column-theres-backlash-globalization-needs-change?utm_source=chatgpt.com) have
surged]{.underline}]{.mark}, with significant pushback against free
trade agreements and economic integration perceived to favour elites
over ordinary citizens. [​Culturally]{.underline}, there has been a
pronounced reaction against progressive ideologies, often labelled as
'wokeness,' encompassing [debates over gender
identity](https://www.cato.org/commentary/floridas-dont-say-gay-bill-inflames-culture-wars),
LGBTQ+ rights, and political correctness. This backlash has manifested
in policies like Florida's 'Don't Say Gay' bill, reflecting a broader
resistance to rapid social changes. Moreover, [[fears
surrounding [immigration and demographic
shifts](https://www.ajc.org/news/what-is-the-alternative-for-germany-or-afd-party)]{.underline}]{.mark} have
[[intensified]{.mark}, with concerns about national identity loss
[fueling]{.mark} the [rise]{.mark} of anti-immigrant rhetoric and
[parties]{.mark}, [such as]{.mark} the Alternative for [Germany
(AfD]{.mark}) and Italy's Brothers of Italy led by Giorgia
Meloni]{.underline}. ​Politically, there has been a notable realignment
characterized by the [emergence of 'strongman'
leaders](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/07/illiberal-democracy-21st-century) who
advocate for illiberal democracy, characterized by manipulation and
corruption.  Figures like Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, Narendra Modi in
India, Viktor Orban in Hungary, and Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey
exemplify this trend, often consolidating power by challenging
traditional liberal institutions and norms. [This [erosion of trust
extends to media, judicial systems, and democratic processes]{.mark},
[contributing to]{.mark} a global [environment where [conservative

Svart's tenure as national director saw the DSA pass through the most
dynamic period in the group's 40+ year history. When she took over in
2011, it had approximately 5,000 members. A series of major national
political events---self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders'
unexpectedly vigorous 2016 campaign for president, Donald Trump's
subsequent election later that year, and DSA member Alexandria
Ocasio-Cortez's upset Democratic primary win in 2018---all combined to
foster explosive growth at the
DSA**[. [[Membership](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zll3BCBpr4ZwruT_ctugQUMCODRcZv7T/view) peaked
at]{.mark} around [95,000 in 2021]{.mark}, [before declining]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} just [under 78,000 by mid-2023]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This
was [[prior to]{.mark} [the DSA's widely]{.mark}]{.underline} (and

to the October 7th Hamas terrorist]{.underline} attacks on Israel, which
[[led to some high-profile public resignations.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Indeed, [[membership]{.mark} appears to be one area where the DSA's
struggles are particularly acute,]{.underline} and this is [[helping
drive a serious fiscal crisis]{.mark} at the largely dues-supported
organization]{.underline}. While Svart wrote that hundreds were joining
the DSA each month, more were leaving or allowing their memberships to
lapse. She noted that the [[group]{.underline}]{.mark} was
[[undergoing]{.underline}]{.mark} "a [[period of **membership
shrinkage** and **increasing financial stress**]{.underline}]{.mark}"
and---remarkably---that unless things changed the DSA would soon "be

[We have slid into a period [in]{.mark} our [labor movement]{.mark}
where **[decline, decay, stagnation, and timid]{.mark}
[leadership]{.mark}** [have become formalized]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
[["leadership]{.mark}"]{.underline} today in many unions [[is at
best]{.mark} an [administrative]{.mark}]{.underline} layer:
functionaries carefully tending to the decline, keeping things on-track
as we are pushed towards oblivion. There are examples to the contrary,
but not very many in my experience. Our left and labor press also
suffers during this period, as [[increasing numbers]{.mark} of writers
come forward who [have virtually **no substantial experience** in labor
work]{.mark}]{.underline}. We have to be careful not to blame the
inexperienced, especially in an era when getting any real experience is
difficult, and sometimes impossible. But [we should not excuse the
editors of these publications, who dutifully cram all sorts of "good
news only" stories into the publications]{.underline}. We have folks
writing articles and even entire books on new organizing today who have
organized few, if any, new workers in their own careers. I use the
example of someone with a car repair issue; How many of us take our cars
to the shop and then tell the service manager to assign the least
experienced "mechanic" to fix our problem? That's patently absurd when
we think of it that way, but this is today how labor staffs most of it
organizing work, and it certainly applies to how many of our left
writers are selected. And to top off this problem, there [[seems to be
little to **no curiosity**]{.mark} **or desire** [to]{.mark} go out and
[find]{.mark} the [people who are, or who have, done the difficult
organizing work]{.mark}]{.underline}. [And really debrief how they are
actually winning the campaigns they are.]{.underline} Our movement
[l[eadership]{.mark}]{.underline} just puts the "organizer" hat on
almost anyone, [[offers **little guidance**]{.mark} and even less
training]{.underline}, and then hires another crop of "organizers" when
they quit---or are fired
