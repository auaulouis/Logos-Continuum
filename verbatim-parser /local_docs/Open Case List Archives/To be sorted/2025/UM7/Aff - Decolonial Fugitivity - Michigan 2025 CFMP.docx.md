coloniality-based narratives of wilderness in US Arctic policy," The

[The [Arctic policy]{.mark} of the United States [is]{.mark} often
[analysed through a lens of]{.mark} geopolitical [competition]{.mark}.
Scholars tend to be [preoccupied with]{.mark}]{.underline} topics such
as perceived '[[icebreaker]{.mark} gap[s]{.mark}'
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} how American Arctic policy has addressed or
not addressed current [Arctic [security]{.mark}]{.underline}
realities.Footnote1 But how does the United States conceptualise its
relationship to the Arctic and what does that mean for American foreign
policy towards the region? Answering these questions is key to
understanding both where the United States is coming from and where it
is going as the Arctic continues to dominate headlines. In this article,
I argue that [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is incapable of
taking just any policy towards the Arctic]{.mark}. The [possibilities
are constrained]{.mark} because American foreign policy is moored
to]{.underline} some set of ideas about the 'wilderness', including the
Arctic. Indeed, I argue that in American foreign policy, ideas and
narratives on wilderness are [[based on coloniality]{.underline}]{.mark}
and are not only a common feature of American biographical continuity,
but they are also broadly consistent and somewhat predictable across
American Arctic policy through the Bush, Obama, and Trump
administrations. Indeed, coloniality-based narratives of wilderness --
including ideas of the wilderness as an economic resource, the
wilderness as diminishing and the wilderness as harsh and unwelcoming --
are visible across American Arctic policy from 2009 to 2021. Scholarly
literature has addressed how coloniality is consistent within Arctic
security policies, but it often takes a Canadian or Nordic lens rather
than an American one.Footnote2 In this article, I analyse American
Arctic policy using a framework drawn from coloniality and wilderness
literature and combining them with an ontological security approach that
highlights the selective activation and deactivation of narratives over
time to serve a broader autobiographical self. In doing so I demonstrate
how studies of coloniality can be combined with ontological security to
provide a more nuanced picture of how states deal with existential
anxiety and how much of themselves is based on coloniality. I begin by
outlining how the field of international relations has conceived of
wilderness in the past, specifically focusing on how [[wilderness has
been framed]{.mark} in the United States]{.underline}, which is grounded
[[in non-Indigenous, racist, and exclusionary identity
politics]{.underline}]{.mark}. I then discuss how concepts of settler
colonialism and coloniality complicate this framing of wilderness and
suggest what implications that has for Indigenous People. I propose that
ontological security studies (OSS) should take these concepts into
account when considering autobiographical state narratives while also
arguing that OSS adds to our understanding of how coloniality is
sustained through policy justifications today. I then use discourse
analysis to identify [narratives of coloniality and wilderness across US
[Arctic policies]{.mark}]{.underline} from the Bush, Obama, and Trump
administrations. These narratives have been separated into themes
including 1) the [[transform]{.underline}]{.mark}ation of [the
[wilderness into resources]{.mark}]{.underline}, 2) the wilderness as
diminishing, and 3) the wilderness as harsh and unwelcoming.
Additionally, there was some mythologising the Arctic and framing of the
region as a theatre for geopolitical competition from 2019 onwards. By
demonstrating the continuity of these narratives, I show that [while the
precise wording and framing may change slightly over time,
[coloniality-based narratives of wilderness are]{.mark} not only a
common feature, but also that they are [fundamental to]{.mark} American
[Arctic policy]{.mark}.]{.underline} My findings indicate that the
United States is constrained in how it creates Arctic policy; thus,
there are a limited number of ways that the Arctic as a wilderness is
conceptualised. That [these narratives]{.underline} have their basis in
coloniality also [demonstrate]{.underline}s [the continued colonial
influence underlying American Arctic policy.]{.underline} Narratives of
wilderness in the United States Wilderness has a complex history, both
in international relations as well as environmental studies more
broadly[. American [perceptions of wilderness]{.mark} have
[tend]{.mark}ed [towards]{.mark} two extremes, either 1) as pristine,
[untouched, and uninhabited, or]{.mark} 2) [something
exploitable]{.mark} for the benefit of extractive capitalist
practices.]{.underline} Over the past two centuries in the United
States, American society has given wilderness different meanings --
varying from deserted and savage, to a sublime way of getting closer to
God, to the American frontier invested with individualism and
masculinity, to a civilised leisure destination for upper middle-class
men, to now as a source of danger in the face of climate
change.Footnote3 Thus, for American society, wilderness has multiple and
changing definitions. Instead, it reflects broader hegemonic social
relations.Footnote4 These imaginaries have broad implications. For
example, [**imagining the [wilderness as]{.mark} pristine and [untouched
legitimates the expulsion of Indigenous People]{.mark}**. Imagining
[it]{.mark} as inherently separate from humans [allows humanity to evade
responsibility for caring for the
environment]{.mark}]{.underline}.Footnote5 [[Wilderness
myths]{.underline}]{.mark} have often been used to [create a sense of
national identity]{.underline}. However, this has often come [at the
expense of the lives of Indigenous People and]{.underline} was used to
[[erase Indigenous understandings of place]{.mark} and
landscape]{.underline}. For example, Turner's 1893 Frontier thesis
suggested that taming the wilderness was synonymous with developing an
independent American identity. However, Turner barely referred to
Indigenous People, which contributed to the erasure of them and their
history.Footnote6 Wilderness is also often thought of as socially
exclusionary, privileging only white, male, and middle class, and is
commodified -- produced for tourism, mining, conservation, and other
extractive uses.Footnote7 This type of thinking comes up again and again
in American society, whether in Theodore Roosevelt's The Wilderness
Hunter and his conservation policies as president, prominent American
conservationist Aldo Leopold's 'wilderness ethic', as well as in modern
environmentalist thought.Footnote8 The rise of the American conservation
movement is associated with many of these hierarchical and political
values that not only erase Indigenous People but at their core are
regarded as anti-Indigenous.Footnote9 While the rise of this movement is
often associated with urban wealthy elites seeking to preserve national
parks, preserving access to fish and game, and business environmentalism
-- other environmental -- and often marginalised -- voices exist too
from marginalised communities with different auspices including a deep
green ecology approach, giving agency to nature, alongside Indigenous
approaches to environmental protection. The urban-elite driven
conservation movement both reinforces settler-colonial relations and
relies on the myth of pure wilderness and the disavowal of original
settler violence.Footnote10 This is prefaced on the ontological
assumption that the wilderness is at its purest when there are no human
inhabitants. However, this is certainly not limited to the urban-elite
driven conservation movement but is also prevalent through how American
policy conceptualises the wilderness across the government and is
visible in the narratives the United States uses to conceptualise
itself. There are other ways of thinking about wilderness that are not
rooted in the dominant American narratives perpetuated by the state.
While there is no essentialised Indigenous way of thinking and knowing
land, there are some commonalities in how wilderness is conceptualised.
Many origin stories from Indigenous People involve intimate relations
with the earth and highlight and ethics of care, suggesting that land is
not only life giving but an active participant in the relationship
between humanity and nature.Footnote11 Despite this, Indigenous
environmental concerns in Alaska has often been belied by careless and
wanton use of resources in Alaskan Native history.Footnote12 Thus, in
contrast to American ways of separating humanity from wilderness and
nature, many Indigenous ways of knowing about wilderness combat that
binary.Footnote13 However, while it is important to acknowledge
Indigenous scholarship on wilderness, doing so runs the risk of
flattening the spiritual and place-based aspects of Indigenous knowledge
without acknowledging the contemporary realities lived by Indigenous
People. This, in turn, can act as a second colonialisation, this time of
knowledge.Footnote14 So, when thinking about how wilderness is conceived
of today, we must also consider ongoing dynamics of settler colonialism
and how they impact Indigenous People today. Wilderness, settler
colonialism, and ontological security When we consider wilderness
through the lens of settler colonialism, it is important to first
consider terminology. Scholars define settler colonialism in differing
but important ways. While Eichler and Baumeister (Citation2021) suggest
it is the commitment of settlers to establish themselves permanently in
the periphery,Footnote15 Coulthard (Citation2014) argues that [[the
set]{.mark}tler-[col]{.mark}onial [relationship is]{.mark} one
[characterised by domination,]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[this]{.mark}
relationship [exists to facilitate]{.mark} the [dispossession]{.mark} of
Indigenous People]{.underline}.Footnote16 Todd (Citation2017) proposes
that settler colonialism reproduces the ideologies, relationships, and
physicality of colonialism as ongoing.Footnote17 Other scholars note
that settler colonialism is also premised on the idea that land is
transformed into private property.Footnote18 What these definitions have
in common is that [there is some continued relationship between
coloniser, colonised, and land that uses naturalised social and
political hierarchies]{.underline}. This leads into thinking about
coloniality, which is key for the purpose of this article. Coloniality,
simply put, is what survives colonialism.Footnote19 According to
Maldonado-Torres (Citation2007, 243), 'Coloniality, instead, refers to
long-standing patterns of power that emerged as a result of colonialism
... it is maintained alive in books, in the criteria for academic
performance, in cultural patterns, in common sense, in the self-image of
peoples, in aspirations of self, and so many other aspects of our modern
experience.'Footnote20 If coloniality is what exists today that is
inherited from past colonial practices, then we can assume that these
hierarchies are present in relations between and within states, as well
as in policy, knowledge production, and across how states handle
creating policy in the Arctic. While the argument that coloniality is
alive and well today is thoroughly addressed in the post-colonial,
decolonial, and Indigenous literature, ontological security studies
(OSS) adds a new dimension to the discussion. OSS has not traditionally
addressed the continuation of colonial legacies as a key part of state
autobiographical narratives. However, what OSS highlights is how one of
the mechanisms through which coloniality is continued is through the
selective activation and deactivation of certain narratives. Rather than
focus on an actor's need for physical security, ontological security
brings attention to security as being. In other words, ontological
security refers to an actor's need for a secure identity that contains a
sense of biographical continuity and brings an emphasis to what stories
and narratives we tell ourselves about ourselves, the relationship we
have with others and the land we conquer, live on, or occupy. Adopting
this lens focuses attention on the relationship between anxiety and
identity, and especially how autobiographical narratives and routines
manage existential identity as a daily yet often unconscious process. In
short, it leads us to ask how do specific narrative anchor state
self-identity and implies that these narratives have an impact on
current stressors and problems.Footnote21 Thus, the scholarship suggests
that scholars should seek out routines, particular narratives and how
ideas are held constant over time to mitigate anxiety. Anxiety, here, is
the ordering principle of how states interact with the world and what
they must manage to feel secure. States can never solve anxiety, but
they can manage it through routines and narratives. OSS has been used to
study securitisation, moral injury, narration of state identity,
radicalisation, and many other questions of international
politics.Footnote22 OSS is a useful narrative for answering the question
of how the United States conceptualises the wilderness in its Arctic
policy. This is because the type of narrative that the United States
uses is indicative of how it manages existential anxiety and how that
selection of narratives is chosen is key to understanding what
underlying principle drives American Arctic policy. In other words, how
does the United States manage its all-encompassing existential anxiety
in the regional case of the Arctic and what narratives are at play?
Which narratives are chosen can tell us something about those underlying
anxieties? Wilderness narratives point to coloniality. Further, OSS
draws attention to biographical continuity -- an idea that this research
aims to flesh out by considering continuity in American Arctic policy
across different presidencies and administrations. OSS literature has
not often addressed the role of coloniality in the shaping of state
autobiographical narratives. While some scholars have noted that
established hierarchies, identities, and relationships play an important
role in colonial biographical continuity, this is far from the
norm.Footnote23 Instead, literature has looked at the role of colonial
subjugation -- namely that the emotional trauma from colonialisation has
influence on how states react to anxiety.Footnote24 Thus, bringing in
understandings of coloniality, particularly in how wilderness is
conceived of, in coloniser state identity is key for advancing OSS.
Importantly, OSS can also add to post-colonial, decolonial, and
Indigenous literature when considering the mechanisms through which
coloniality is sustained. OSS literature has discussed how states
selectively activate and deactivate parts of their autobiographical
narratives to fit new events and new anxieties into their
worldview.Footnote25 The instrumental use of these narratives adds
nuance to the discussion of how places like the United States may take
different stances to the Arctic over time, but that they all rely on
coloniality to reinforce power relations that place the United States on
top of social and political hierarchies. Bringing together
understandings of coloniality, settler colonialism, wilderness, and
ontological security is essential for the purposes of this article. This
is because I argue that in sustaining its ontological security, the
United States uses coloniality-based narratives of wilderness in the
broader context of settler colonialism. In other words, the mechanisms
through which the United States supports its Arctic policy reveal
coloniality-based narratives of wilderness, narratives which have been
selectively activated throughout different administrations (Bush, Obama,
and Trump), suggesting that the United States' ontological security
relies on such framings. Methodology The main question underpinning my
research is: what types of narratives of wilderness are present in
American Arctic policy and are they present consistently across
different presidencies? To answer this question, I conducted a discourse
analysis of 15 significant American Arctic policy documents from 2009 to
2021 -- covering the Bush, Obama, and Trump presidencies. As of the
writing of this article, there are no documents that have been
officially produced by the Biden administration and thus the analysis
only covers through the end of the Trump administration. Before
preceding it is important to note that of course American Arctic policy
has a much longer history than the Bush, Obama, and Trump
administrations and limiting my analysis to these three administrations
has the possibility to distort the context of policy. Taking this
shortened time analysis allows for a more detailed content analysis of
fewer documents -- drawing out textual references to coloniality in
American ontological security. Moreover, scholars have suggested that
beginning with the Bush administration's NSPD-66 document is a good
entry point for any analysis of American Arctic policy as it was driven
by the impetus of the 2007 Russian flag planting the proactive
restatement of American interest in the region.Footnote26 Further, this
research is focused primarily on coloniality rather than great power
competition, either with Russia or the Soviet Union or climate change.
Certainly, these two variables are important to consider in Arctic
politics and in this American Arctic policy analysis -- and will best be
served in future research. I began by looking for how wilderness was
conceptualised in these documents, exploring how context shaped the
wilderness and the Arctic environment in particular ways. I also looked
for examples of coloniality in the documents connected to the
wilderness. I then conducted a more quantitative-based analysis, looking
for both the presence as well as the absence of specific words including
'diminish, 'harsh', 'wilderness', 'frontier', 'pristine', and
'threatened'. By gathering information both on the broader context of
how the wilderness was described and collecting quantitative-based
information on those framings, I aimed to triangulate if the United
States was using coloniality-based narratives of the wilderness to
justify its policy over a series of American presidential
administrations. The next sections will describe a variety of themes
that were found by using this discourse analysis method including: 1)
the wilderness as economic opportunity, 2) the wilderness as diminishing
and 3) the wilderness as harsh and unwelcoming and additional
mythologising and geopolitical narratives. US Arctic policy: wilderness
as economic opportunity 'The Arctic region's energy resources factor
into a core component of our national security strategy: energy
security. The region holds sizeable proved and potential oil and natural
gas resources that will likely continue to provide valuable supplies to
meet U.S. energy needs' 2013 National Strategy [Across the broad range
of Arctic policy documents published by the United States]{.underline},
perhaps [[the most common narrative that surrounds the Arctic is]{.mark}
the wilderness's [capacity for economic
opportunity]{.mark}.]{.underline} Starting with [[the]{.mark} 2009 [Navy
Arctic Roadmap]{.mark}]{.underline}, many American policies [[highlight
the]{.mark} Arctic's [potential for]{.mark} resource
[extraction]{.mark}.]{.underline} Among the roadmap's goals, [the policy
calls for an assessment]{.underline}, (p. 24) ' ... with particular
emphasis on the time frame in which ice extent and thickness will allow
[for trans-Arctic shipping and significant increase in]{.underline}
intra-Arctic shipping resource [extraction]{.underline}.' Gathering
information about when such extraction and economic opportunities will
be available is a key to these policies. As the quote at the beginning
of this section illustrates, the Arctic's resources are even framed as a
benefit for the energy security of the United States. As I illustrate
below, [such [framing]{.mark}s of [the Arctic as this realm for
extractive purposes]{.mark}]{.underline} and economic prosperity [are
not only common]{.underline}, but [they [are]{.mark}]{.underline} also
[[the norm in]{.mark} how American Arctic [policy]{.mark} describes the
region.]{.underline} Throughout the many policies released by the
different branches of the defence sector of the government from 2019 to
2021, the region is framed continuously as one with many resources that
can be exploited. The Coast Guard's Strategic Outlook begins their
entire policy by listing the economic value of different extractive
practices on the third page of the document, describing the region as
(p. 13) ' ... likely to be home to a wealth of undiscovered resources,
which will become more accessible as environmental conditions change.'
In a key speech Pompeo gave to the Arctic Council in 2019, he describes
the Arctic ' ... at the forefront of opportunity and abundance.' He goes
on to even qualify what he means by opportunity, stating 'It houses 13%
of the world's undiscovered oil, 30% of its undiscovered gas, and an
abundance of uranium, rare earth minerals, gold, diamonds, and millions
of square miles of untapped resources. Fisheries galore.' American
documents and framings of the Arctic in this way seem to be consistent
over time, with the 2020 Air Force Arctic Strategy, repeating the same
listing of economic opportunities that are to be gained from Arctic
engagement, (p. 7) 'The Arctic is estimated to harbour over 90 billion
barrels of oil reserves, 30% of the world's untapped natural gas, and
around one trillion dollars' worth of rare earth minerals.' In the 2021
Army Arctic Strategy, similar words are used to discuss the Arctic, as
(p. 3) ' ... opening up new opportunities for natural resource
extraction, shipping routes, and commercial fishing' and as (p. 4)
'decreased sea ice and glacial mass will open access to currently
unclaimed natural resources.' Most recently, the Department of Homeland
Security's 2021 Arctic Strategy frames climate change as key to (p. 13)
'unlock\[ing\] previously inaccessible resources and trade route
opportunities for both Arctic and non-Arctic states.' Moreover, this
language of economic opportunity is present in early documents as well.
As referenced above, as early as the 2009 Navy Roadmap and through the
Obama administration, the region was framed as a new boon for developing
energy resources, and a new place to develop energy security by
exploiting oil and gas resources. [This type of narrative shows
continuity and consistency over time -- suggesting that [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is incapable of conceiving its policies
any differently]{.mark} when it is so fundamentally moored in ideas of
economic extraction.]{.underline} One might expect that treating the
wilderness as this economic boon would result in the usage of words like
'frontier' and 'wilderness' to frame the region as uninhabited and one
ripe for exploitation and exploration. However, both words were only
used twice in the 2013 National Strategy for the Arctic, once in the
2013 Managing for the Future in a Rapidly Changing Arctic policy, and
once in the 2019 Department of Defence Arctic Strategy. The word
'frontier', like 'wilderness', also has a history and it is likely that
while its usage may have been more reasonable in 2013, as time has
passed, the narrative of the Arctic as a frontier became less accepted
and thus using more economic language and examples to describe
commodification were used instead. Much of this framing comes back to
the wilderness as commodifiedFootnote27 -- produced for extractive
purposes and suggesting that the wilderness here as framed as a resource
that will be used for the benefit of the American economy. [This
instrumentalized extractive framing of the wilderness also comes back to
coloniality -- more crucially that the desire to tame wilderness and
transform that land into usable resources is of colonial
origin.]{.underline}Footnote28

The [loss of traditional knowledge is a]{.underline}n important barrier
to adaptation in the Arctic. External pressures such as globalisation
cause [resource [extraction, displacement, and environmental
degradation, impact]{.mark}]{.underline}ing [[Indigenous knowledge
systems,]{.mark} cultural [practices, languages, and
institutions]{.mark}]{.underline} \[21\], hence [[perpetuating epistemic
injustice]{.mark}.]{.underline} Economic and environmental changes
exacerbate this, [[causing generational discontinuities in the transfer
of]{.mark} traditional [knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline} to younger
generations \[81\]. There is limited prioritisation of Indigenous
Peoples in adaptation policy development and support to respond to
climate impacts 10, 13. [[The lack of engagement and exclusion of
Indigenous Peoples]{.mark}, knowledge, and perspectives [from
policy]{.mark}]{.underline} formulations [is a barrier that [affects the
implementation of]{.mark} effective culturally sensitive adaptation
strategies and [policies]{.mark} tailored and relevant to Indigenous
Peoples]{.underline} 49, 87. [[Cultural practices]{.mark} such as
sharing networks, communal hunting, oral traditions, storytelling, and
connections to the land and ocean [are affected by loss of traditional
hunting grounds and wildlife due to climate change]{.mark}]{.underline}
impacts \[29\], [[affecting food security and weakening community
agency]{.mark}, cultural identity, resilience, and adaptive
capacity]{.underline}. [Indigenous knowledge systems are]{.underline}
important for adaptation and are [at risk due to]{.underline} cultural
[assimilation]{.underline}, modernisation, generational gaps, [and
transformative environmental changes]{.underline} 108, 77. This loss
creates barriers, as it reduces adaptive capacity and coping mechanisms,
undermining the ability of communities to respond effectively to
changing climatic conditions. It reduces sustainable resource management
and adaptive capacities and practices where communities could
potentially lose critical insights that inform locally appropriate and
culturally sensitive adaptation strategies 23, 87. [In Scandinavia, Sami
herding traditions, which involve adaptive rotational grazing to
maintain reindeer populations, are often disregarded]{.underline} in
conservation planning. [Instead, policymakers prioritise
E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion environmental [regulations
that enforce fixed grazing]{.underline} boundaries 100, 68. [In Canadian
Arctic, younger generations are increasingly disconnected from
traditional hunting practices due]{.underline} to the influence of
modern lifestyles, climate change, and the decline in wildlife
populations 56, 81. This loss of traditional knowledge creates a barrier
to adaptation, as communities lose the ability to respond effectively to
changing environmental conditions. The role of gendered labour norms
acts as a barrier and plays a significant role in shaping adaptive
capacity and decision-making. While men traditionally occupied roles as
hunters, herders, and fishermen, climate change is altering these
economic foundations, necessitating new employment opportunities \[7\].
In Sami communities, men's ability to continue reindeer herding is being
undermined by shrinking pastures, forcing women into new economic roles
\[73\]. In many Arctic communities, women are leaving for education and
employment opportunities, which can both mitigate and exacerbate
vulnerabilities \[12\]. While improved education and job access can
enhance resilience, they may also lead to the outmigration of skilled
individuals, further straining community cohesion and adaptive capacity.
In Greenland, many Indigenous women are leaving their communities to
seek education and employment in Denmark and urban areas, which provides
economic empowerment but also weakens intergenerational knowledge
transfer and community cohesion 54, 82. While these individual choices
offer economic mobility, they weaken the transmission of traditional
adaptation strategies, presenting both a barrier and a limit --- a limit
because the cultural shift away from subsistence practices is often
irreversible. Social norms tied to [traditional [subsistence practices
are being]{.mark} fundamentally [disrupted]{.mark} by climate
change]{.underline}, leading to limits on adaptation. [An important
example of this limit is the loss of key wildlife species essential to
Indigenous diets and cultural identity]{.underline}. The decline of
[[caribou]{.underline}]{.mark} [[populations]{.underline}]{.mark} [in
the]{.underline} Canadian [Arctic has [reached a point where]{.mark}
some [communities can no longer rely on this culturally and
nutritionally important species]{.mark}]{.underline} 8, 93. This
represents a limit to adaptation, as the loss of caribou undermines food
security, cultural identity, and traditional practices, significantly
impacting Inuit communities. [Conservation efforts, such as restricting
caribou hunting]{.underline}, address ecological sustainability but
[force communities to abandon traditional food-sharing
networks]{.underline}, important for survival and social cohesion
\[42\]. In Greenland, Inuit hunters rely on sea ice for seal and whale
hunting, which is economically and culturally significant. However, with
sea ice loss accelerating, these traditional hunting grounds are
disappearing \[37\]. This represents a limit --- without ice, these
practices cannot continue. This leads to both food insecurity and
cultural erosion. Individual values Arctic Indigenous communities are
not homogenous; individual values and economic preferences vary
significantly across regions, influenced by local economic
opportunities, cultural activities, state policies, and
place/community-specific histories. While some communities remain deeply
connected to subsistence economies --- such as Nenets reindeer herders
in Siberia or Iñupiaq whalers in Alaska --- others, particularly younger
generations, are transitioning towards wage-based employment, education,
and urban employment 26, 27. Sami herders are increasingly using modern
economic practices, such as using drones, GPS tracking, Geographic
Information System, and market-based reindeer farming, helping them
adapt to a changing climate 35, 41. In contrast, Siberian reindeer
herders often lack access to such technologies due to economic
disparities and centralised Russian governance, making adaptation
difficult \[48\]. In Alaska, Indigenous women often face limited access
to health, education, and employment opportunities, affecting community
resilience 60, 86. This barrier is compounded by the outmigration of
skilled individuals, further straining community cohesion \[60\]. This
migration trend, while individually beneficial, weakens the adaptive
capacity of communities, as fewer young people remain to sustain
traditional hunting, fishing, and herding practices. As climate change
alters the Arctic environment, many Indigenous communities are forced to
shift away from traditional subsistence practices, leading to increased
dependence on expensive technologies for food gathering, imported foods,
and fuel \[76\]. The reliance on technologies such as high-efficiency
snowmobiles and gasoline for transportation, advanced fishing equipment
and boats for food gathering and travelling, and GPS systems and
satellite phones for navigation has increased 20••, 23, 84. However,
buying these technologies is costly, imposing a significant social and
financial strain on communities and creating social inequities. This is
exacerbated by an increased reliance on expensive store-bought foods, a
high cost of living, and dependence on global markets and price
fluctuations \[••65\]. This economic shift presents a barrier for
lower-income households that cannot afford adaptation costs, as well as
a limit for communities that have surpassed economic feasibility
thresholds. Inability to adapt due to financial constraints presents a
significant limit to adaptation. In Chukotka, Russia, many Indigenous
communities live in poverty, with limited access to resources and
infrastructure \[53\]. This financial constraint creates a limit to
adaptation, as communities cannot afford the technologies or
infrastructure needed to cope with climate change. The limited mobility
due to fixed settlements acts as a limit. In Alaska, many Indigenous
communities were forcibly relocated to fixed settlements. These
settlements are now vulnerable to rising sea levels and permafrost thaw,
limiting the ability of communities to adapt through traditional
mobility practices 25, 51. Psychosocial factors Psychosocial factors
such as [cultural [alienation, mental health struggles,
intergenerational disconnect, and loss of trust]{.mark} in institutions
[shape]{.mark} how [Arctic Indigenous communities]{.mark} perceive,
engage with, and respond to climate change]{.underline}. [Indigenous
communities face historical trauma of forced displacement]{.underline}
and cultural alienation \[88\]. Many Indigenous communities are facing
the threat of climate-induced relocation, as coastal erosion, permafrost
thawing, and extreme weather events threaten settlements that have
existed for generations 12, 51. However, [relocation is not just a
physical challenge --- it represents a rupture in cultural continuity,
identity, and psychological well-being]{.underline}. In Alaska, the
communities of Shishmaref, Newtok, and Kivalina, are facing forced
relocation due to rising sea levels and coastal erosion 25, 9. For many
community members, this [[displacement]{.underline}]{.mark} represents
more than just losing a home --- it [[means losing]{.mark} a way of
[life, severing]{.mark}]{.underline} their [[spiritual and cultural
ties]{.mark}]{.underline} to the land \[71\]. In Siberia, Indigenous
Evenki and Nenets herders face disruptions to traditional migration
routes due to industrial expansion and resource extraction \[96\]. These
changes force some herders into fixed settlements, where they experience
high levels of psychological distress and increased dependency on state
welfare systems \[52\]. This psychological trauma represents an
adaptation limit --- once the connection to land is severed, a
fundamental part of Indigenous identity is lost.

forms throughout the world: [[groups]{.mark} [experience]{.mark}

Duvall 2005, 42. 41 varying ways along multiple societal cleavages
dependent upon the specific context, and not all forms of societal
non-dominance may be relevant to securitization. However, understanding
the relationship between power and non-dominance is important to this
dissertation project because it also influences who is able to
contribute, and in what ways, to public discourse: "Relations of
dominance and non-dominance determine who defines norms and practices
and who must follow them; who is important and who is not; who defines
the parameters of the debate and who does not; who is valuable and who
is not."113 In some cases, non-dominance may translate into structural
or systematic restrictions upon a group's ability to influence
government policy regarding designation and defence against security
threats to that group. Securitization nondominance reflects both
structural and institutional power, because it is both direct and
constitutive of actors, and diffused through regulation of the
interactions between particular social actors. Securitization
non-dominance is thus a reflection of broader forms of nondominance as
they pertain to the ability to construct and respond to in/security. The
argument of securitization non-dominance is fully developed in Chapter
3, and the forms of non-dominance experienced by Arctic Indigenous
peoples are discussed further below and in their specific national
contexts in Chapters 4-7. 2.2 Indigenous Peoples in the Arctic
Indigenous peoples in the circumpolar region exhibit both typical and
atypical traits for indigenous peoples in contemporary global politics.
On the one hand, they are historically colonized populations who no
longer exert full decision-making authority over their traditional
lands. They also demonstrate clear continuity with pre-colonial
practices and social organization, due in part to the relatively recent
experiences of colonization by many Arctic Indigenous peoples,
especially in North America. On the other hand, most of the Arctic
states are stronger democratic systems with rule of law, economic and
social benefits, and respect for indigenous rights than many other
countries with indigenous populations. As discussed below, Arctic
Indigenous peoples enjoy among the highest qualities of life and
greatest degrees of 113 Gunhild Hoogensen and Kirsti Stuvøy, "Gender,
Resistance, and Human Security," Security Dialogue 37, no. (2006): 219.
42 political autonomy and inclusion of any indigenous peoples in the
world. With the notable exception of Russia, Arctic Indigenous peoples
have politically organized themselves into formations that sometimes
challenge the preferences of their colonial state governments without
fear of overt political repression, violence, or retaliation.
[[They]{.mark} thus enjoy a **higher degree** of **political freedom**
than most, while also [experiencing]{.mark} **[material]{.mark}**
conditions and **political non[dominance]{.mark}** [that]{.mark}
**[curtail]{.mark} their [political agency]{.mark}**,
[reflecting]{.mark} their **[status]{.mark} [within]{.mark}** their

**[debates over indigeneity]{.mark}** and identity remain
[relevant]{.mark} in the circumpolar region, [by virtue]{.mark} of their
distinct structures of political representation **[Arctic Indigenous
peoples]{.mark}** are somewhat more clearly identifiable than
elsewhere.]{.underline} By definition, they comprise the Indigenous
peoples living in the Arctic regions of the eight circumpolar states.
Informed by the Cobo definition, the Arctic Human Development Report
defines Indigenous peoples as: Those peoples who were marginalized when
the modern states were created and identify themselves as indigenous
peoples. They are associated with specific territories to which they
trace their histories. They exhibit one or more of the following
characteristics: they speak a language that is different from that of
the dominant group(s); they are being [**[discriminated
against]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the **[political]{.mark}**
system]{.underline}; they are being discriminated against within [the
**[legal]{.mark} [system]{.mark}**]{.underline}; their [**[cultures
diverge]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} that of the **[remaining
society]{.mark}**]{.underline}; they often [**diverge** from the
mainstream society]{.underline} in their **[resource use]{.underline}**
by being hunters and gatherers, nomads, pastoralists, or swidden
farmers; they consider themselves and are [[considered]{.mark} by others
as **[different]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} the **[rest]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
the [population]{.mark}**]{.underline}.114 Indigenous peoples number
approximately 500,000 out of the total 4 million inhabitants of the
circumpolar region, and, as shown in Figure 2, form a ring of
overlapping trans-state populations surrounding the Arctic Ocean. A
majority of these live in Russia, which also has the greatest diversity
of Indigenous peoples with over 41 different groups, including the more
populous Chukchi, Evenki, Khaka, Khanty, Nenet, Tuvan, and Yakut
peoples. Aleuts are indigenous people in the easternmost Russian region
of Kamchatka who also inhabit the islands off western Alaska. Mainland
Alaska is home to Athabaskan, Gwich'in, and Inuit (Alaskan Eskimo)
peoples whose territories cross into northern Canada. Inuit form a
majority of the Indigenous population 114 Csonka and Schweitzer 2004,

population in the Canadian Arctic, as well as a large majority of nearly
90 percent in neighbouring Greenland. Sámi are the only recognized
Indigenous people in all of Europe, comprising the entire indigenous
populations of Norway, Sweden, and Finland, with a small number also on
the Kola Peninsula in western Russia.115 While now rooted in the social
and political structures of particular states, the sociological
boundaries of Arctic Indigenous peoples are not consistent with the
colonial boundaries that have been imposed upon them. Indigenous peoples
serve as living reminders of pre-modern patterns of habitation in the
circumpolar region, and reflect relationships and associations that
transcend sovereign borders. The formal political involvement of
Indigenous peoples in the circumpolar region is one of the key features
of the post-Cold War Arctic order. In addition to significant degrees of
selfgovernment, political autonomy, or elected representation exercised
by Indigenous peoples throughout much of the region -- particularly Self
Rule for the Inuit majority in Greenland; selfgovernment or high
representation in public governments for Canadian Inuit through the
establishment of four land claim areas; and the separate Sámi
Parliaments of Norway, Sweden, and Finland -- Indigenous peoples have
also been central to the establishment and activities of the Arctic
Council. Founded in 1996 to provide a dedicated regional forum for
dialogue and cooperation, the Council owes much of the impetus for its
creation to the organization and activism of Indigenous advocacy groups.
Since the 1960s, Indigenous peoples across the Arctic increasingly
established representative organizations to both lobby governments and
speak on behalf of their people, who at the time very much remained
colonial subjects of their southernbased governments. John English,
historian of the Arctic Council, credits the efforts of these
organizations and the leaders they produced with the eventual success of
the Arctic Council negotiations: "Voices that were silenced in the
fifties became audible in the sixties, eloquent in the seventies, and
powerful and influential later. The colonized now came to the colonial
capitals no longer as subjects but as actors shaping their times and the
lives of their people."116 The emergence of Indigenous voices as a
potent political force would substantially alter the shape of the
circumpolar region. 115 Antoine Dubreuil, "The Arctic of the Regions:
Between Indigenous Peoples and Sub-National Entities -- Which
Perspective?" International Journal 66, no. 4 (2011): 923-938. 116 John
English, Ice and Water: Politics, Peoples, and the Arctic Council
(Toronto: Penguin, 2013), 95. 45 Arising from social movements for
Indigenous rights and representation, six groups were formally
incorporated into regional **[[governance]{.underline}]{.mark}** through
their inclusion as Permanent Participants on the Arctic Council: the
Arctic Athabaskan Council, Aleut International Association, Gwich'in
Council International, Inuit Circumpolar Council, Russian Association of
Indigenous Peoples of the North, and the Saami Council. As the first
international intergovernmental body in the world to grant indigenous
peoples formal status with rights to membership and participation
approximating that of the Member States, the Council provides Indigenous
peoples with representation at the premier forum for regional
cooperation. English argues that "it is a mark of the historic change
that the growing prominence of the Arctic Council with its indigenous
participants means that many rules will now be set not only in imperial
southern capitals but often by northern peoples."117 English's detailed
analysis of the Council's origins concurs with the conclusions of other
leading scholars like Oran Young that it is partly through the efforts
of Indigenous peoples that the Arctic has developed from a "region of
peripheries" into a coherent region of its own,118 and with Timo
Koivurova and Leena Heinämäki that Arctic Indigenous peoples have become
so key to regional politics as to enjoy a status close to that of
vetoholders.119 Although they continue to reflect the significant
differences of opportunity afforded by their respective historical
experiences and contemporary circumstances, Arctic Indigenous peoples
have been at the forefront of advancing the political interests of
indigenous peoples and their inclusion in organizations and fora
previously reserved for states. In this respect, Arctic Indigenous
peoples reflect the global achievements of indigenous peoples in
fostering an awareness of indigeneity as a basis for rights and
political inclusion, and establishing a social movement to support the
political project of "global indigenism."120 The adoption of the United
Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 2007, the
creation of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, and moves
towards recognition and reparations for colonially inflicted wrongs all
signify the contemporary emergence of indigenous 117 English 2013, 298.

Despite the significant progress that has been made by settler-colonial
governments and legal authorities in terms of acknowledging and
respecting indigenous rights and title, the relationships between
indigenous peoples and their governments remain structured by the
dominance of settler-colonial values, institutions, and interests.
Though more empowered than ever before, and more so than most indigenous
peoples elsewhere in the world, even in the Arctic, Indigenous peoples
lack the power to control their own collective futures. 2.3 Research,
Non-Dominance and Indigenous Peoples The non-dominance of Arctic
Indigenous peoples is reflected in two distinct forms: material and
non-material (ideational). The material reflections of political
non-dominance vary by country and are discussed in subsequent chapters,
but generally [include **[lower qualities]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
[life]{.mark}, forms of **[governmental control]{.mark}**, and
**[restrictions]{.mark}** [upon]{.mark} [indigenous]{.mark} rights and
[autonomy]{.mark} [resulting]{.mark} [from]{.mark} "the
**[demoralising]{.mark} effects** of **[dispossession]{.mark}**, [forced
removals]{.mark}, **[open racism]{.mark}** and
**discrimination**]{.underline}, and [**[destruction]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} language, **[identity]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark}
**[culture]{.mark}**]{.underline}."122 Less overt but more pernicious,
however, is [the **ideational** non-dominance that has resulted in the
**[discrediting]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} **[indigenous]{.mark}** forms of
knowledge and **[knowledge production]{.mark}**, the
[privileging]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [settler-colonial]{.mark} legal and
political systems, and the ongoing **[marginalization]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} [indigenous]{.mark}** [ways of]{.mark} **knowing** and
[being]{.mark} **[relative]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} those of
**[settlers]{.mark}**. Ideational non-dominance is a form of power
[that]{.mark} [operates]{.mark} "[in]{.mark} [underlying]{.mark}
[social]{.mark} structures and [systems]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[knowledge]{.mark} that advantage some and disadvantage
others]{.underline}."123 ."123 [Indigenous **[traditional
knowledge]{.mark}** and traditional ecological knowledge have long been
[viewed]{.mark} as **[threatening]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} the **[colonial
order]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and have been subjected to concerted
efforts at destruction, 121 Maaka and Fleras 2005, 12. 122 Maaka and
Fleras 2005, 26. 123 Barnett and Duvall 2005, 42. 47 erasure, and
forgetting. As Linda Tuhiwai Smith asserts, "the [**[negation]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} [indigenous]{.mark} views of history was a [critical]{.mark}
part of **asserting** **colonial [ideology]{.mark}**]{.underline},
partly [because such views]{.underline} were regarded as clearly
'primitive' and 'incorrect' and mostly because they [challenged and
**resisted the vision** of colonization]{.underline}."124 [Colonial
[authorities]{.mark} sought to [render]{.mark} [indigenous populations
legible to]{.mark} **new forms** of **[state
power]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which necessitated [[structuring the
social terrain]{.mark}]{.underline} on which indigenous/non-indigenous
relations would occur [[in a manner **advantageous** to the
colonizer]{.underline}]{.mark}. This included depriving prior indigenous
knowledge and forms of organization of the legitimacy to challenge
settler-colonial organization and Western forms of knowledge by
subjecting them to alien standards of colonial law and morality,
preventing their transmission to younger generations, and eventually
co-opting them into certain settler-colonial decision-making processes
and academic research.125 [The result has been the **widespread
[discrediting]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the scientific validity,
**[legal]{.mark} [weight]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark} [moral]{.mark}

precisely [on]{.mark} the [basis]{.mark} [of]{.mark} its **difference**
from **[settler-colonial]{.mark}**/scientific **[rationalist]{.mark}
modes** of **[thought]{.mark}** and **action**.]{.underline}126 The
ideational dimension of indigenous non-dominance is important to specify
because it sets the context for the material dimension that is more
readily visible in indigenous/non-indigenous relations. The two are
intimately linked, as it is the severing of indigenous peoples' ties to
their cultural and epistemological heritage that facilitates the
material dispossession of their lands, rights, and resources, and
establishes the context for settler domination in their new societies.
Erasure occurs in two ways: through the exclusion and enforced
forgetting of traditional indigenous knowledge, and through the
displacement and disruption of societies guided by and responsible for
generating that knowledge. Vandana Shiva observes: "Over and above
rendering local knowledge invisible by declaring it non-existent or
illegitimate, the dominant system also makes alternatives disappear by
erasing or destroying the reality which they attempt to represent."127
The current Arctic context exemplifies this dynamic, wherein traditional
knowledge has been denied scientific authority and excluded from
official decision making at the 124 Linda Tuhiwai Smith, Decolonizing

settler-colonial political, economic, and social policies have wrought
changes on Arctic societies and ecosystems that undermine the
applicability of traditional knowledge in the first place. Relevant
examples range from human impacts on the Arctic ecosystem such that
traditional ecological knowledge no longer reflects the characteristics
of the circumpolar climate, to settler-colonial policies that have
discriminated against indigenous women with impacts on traditional
structures of community authority.128 The [**[rejection]{.mark}** and
delegitimization of indigenous knowledge]{.underline} [[provides]{.mark}
a **[vital precondition]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} the **[material]{.mark}**
[non]{.mark}-[dominance]{.mark} [experienced by **indigenous
peoples**]{.mark}]{.underline}, particularly as it pertains to the
inability to make decisions regarding traditional land-use on ancestral
territories, and related decisions over how indigenous peoples can and
should live in the modern world. 2.3.1 Decolonization and Indigenist
Research A central component of this dissertation involves the
understandings of Indigenous peoples towards the meaning of in/security
in the Arctic region. Given the importance of epistemology and knowledge
production to power relations between indigenous and non-indigenous
peoples, pursuing appropriate and respectful research involving
indigenous peoples is complicated by a history of Western academic
research fraught with deceit, injustice, abuse, appropriation, and
perpetuation of the very structures that render indigenous peoples
non-dominant within their national communities. One of the key functions
that academic research has performed in this process is the explicit or
implicit privileging of settler-colonial and state perspectives,
resulting in the erasure and denial of indigenous histories,
epistemologies, and contemporary interests.129 Far from just the
objective interpretation of facts through theory, Tuhiwai Smith notes
the "problem is that academic writing is a form of selecting, arranging
and presenting knowledge. It 128 The differences between Western
scientific and indigenous observations of Arctic climate change are
shown in the film Qapirangajuq: Inuit Knowledge and Climate Change,
which highlights some of the disagreements and differing interpretations
between indigenous and scientific understandings of the changing
environment. The film is available at
http://www.isuma.tv/inuit-knowledge-and-climate-change. For a discussion
of traditional knowledge and traditional forms of community authority
see Stephanie Irlbacher-Fox, Jackie Price, and Elena Wilson-Rowe,

Canadian Arctic," in Hoogensen Gjørv et al., Environmental and Human
Security in the Arctic (New York: Routledge, 2014). 129 Marie Battiste,
ed, Reclaiming Indigenous Voice and Vision (Vancouver: UBC Press, 2000);
Tuhiwai Smith 1999. 49 privileges sets of texts, views about the history
of an idea, what issues count as significant; and, by engaging in the
same process uncritically, we too can render indigenous writers
invisible or unimportant while reinforcing the validity of other
writers."130 If research into issues pertaining to indigenous peoples is
undertaken without consideration of their views, including but not
limited to the inclusion of indigenous voices and perspectives, then
that research contributes to the "cognitive imperialism" that
underpinned colonization.131 Perhaps especially for disciplines such as
political science, international relations, and security studies that
have primarily focused on state behaviour, the international system of
sovereign states, and the mechanisms of interstate violence and
cooperation that constitute global order, there has been little account
of indigenous peoples: "On the international scene it is extremely rare
and unusual when indigenous accounts are accepted and acknowledged as
valid interpretations of what has taken place."132 Therefore,
contemporary research must be conscious of its role in supporting or
silencing the voices of indigenous peoples and other non-dominant
groups, and the ethical implications of writing them out of academic
accounts of modern politics. To this end, Tuhiwai Smith promotes an
'indigenist' research agenda to help decolonize the methodological and
epistemological approaches of academic research. For indigenous
scholars, decolonizing research may be integral to their individual and
collective senses of Self as indigenous people,133 but for
non-indigenous scholars, like myself, the drive for an indigenist
research agenda "evolves from a need to comprehend, resist, and
transform the crises related to the dual concerns of the effect that
colonization has had on Indigenous peoples and the ongoing erosion of
Indigenous languages, knowledge, and culture as a result of
colonization."134 In this way, indigenist research "borrows freely from
feminist research and critical approaches to research, but privileges
indigenous voices."135 For me, the desire to help decolonize research
through this dissertation stems from: recognition that the Euro-centric
theoretical traditions of 130 Tuhiwai Smith 1999, 36. 131 Battiste 2000,

Battiste 2000, xx-xxi. 135 Tuhiwai Smith 1999, 147. 50 academia offer an
incomplete understanding of the social and natural worlds;
acknowledgment of the historic and contemporary harms inflicted on
indigenous peoples by the convergence of state practices and mainstream
scholarship; and understanding that circumpolar research is empirically
incomplete without incorporating the views of Arctic Indigenous peoples.

#### Settler colonialism defines social and political relations that normalizes ongoing extraction, dispossession, and dehumanization

Architecture & Urbanism, Carleton University, "There Is a Breach in the

[[Set]{.mark}tler [col]{.mark}onialism]{.underline} here
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} explored as [[a social formation]{.mark}: as
an imaginary, an attitude, and [an orientation that practices
taking]{.mark}, fixing, and apportioning]{.underline}.9 Architecture
represents the materialization of such social formation through the ways
[it [normalizes]{.mark} the [occupation]{.mark} of
land]{.underline}---what can be called "settler colonial
earth-writing"---[[through]{.mark} paving, irrigating, leveling,
cutting, digging[, extracting]{.mark}, displacing, [and securing
grounds.]{.mark}]{.underline} Architecture enshrines occupation by its
highly literal presence on terrains where existing relationships are
materially disrupted. As Heather Davis and Zoe Todd write,
[[set]{.mark}tler [col]{.mark}onialism "[is a severing of
relations]{.mark} between humans and the soil, between plants and
animals, between minerals and our bones.]{.underline}"10

Settler colonial earth-writing does not only operate materially.
[[Settlers developed]{.mark} complex [fictions to erase Indigenous
peoples' rights]{.mark} to their land [under their own legal
systems]{.mark} and worldviews, appropriating Indigenous territory under
the legal doctrine of terra nullius]{.underline}. [[These fictions
dehumanized Indigenous communities in order to reconcile the colonial
imaginary of empty land and the embodied experience of
settlement]{.underline}]{.mark}.11 The spatial descriptions that emerge
from these stories reflect the spatial illiteracy of colonists who,
without their customary units to "measure" the land, disregarded foreign
soil as a complex materiality brimming with cultural history. Emilie
Cameron argues [that [settler representations of the
arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} [continuously [nourish a sense of settlers
as innocent witnesses to the suffering of]{.mark} northern [Indigenous
peoples]{.mark} in order [to secure]{.mark} northern [resource
extraction and land]{.mark} [claims]{.mark}.]{.underline}12 Per Cameron,
these settler stories or fictions matter in the sense that they are
relational and material ordering practices that characterize settlers'
relationship to people and land.13

The soil itself is a major medium through which these complex fictions
manifest. In Dubravka Sekulić, Milica Tomić, and Philipp Sattler's
account of soil as an archive, "[[colonial
practices]{.underline}]{.mark}, having spread across territories and
soils, and once confined to the colonial context, [[continue to inform
our ideas of minerals]{.mark}, species, race, and gender, [permeating
our behavior]{.mark}, institutions, and imaginary to the present
day]{.underline}."14 On Turtle Island, [one enduring colonial fiction is
that of the pristine "north]{.underline}." Sherill Grace notes how
numerous disciplines have been mesmerized by the "north" and how it has
inspired countless authors.15 Robert Kroetsch writes: "\[t\]o write is,
in some metaphoric sense, to go North. To go North is, in some
metaphoric sense, to write."16 His consideration of the "north" and the
act of writing as a mutual metaphor is strong in the colonial
imagination. Comparing the white page to a virgin space, a terra nullia,
to write upon, suggests that the "north" is waiting to be written.
Geopoetic space par excellence, the "north," proves fertile for the
imaginations and fantasies of architects, engineers, and planners.

other oppressive systems]{.mark} often follow or [build
upon]{.mark}]{.underline} with the aim to sever Indigenous relationships
with place (Table 1). As such, [it is important to center]{.underline}
settler colonialism and [underlying colonial logics]{.underline} (i.e.,
logics that seek to minimize and erase Indigenous Peoples and ways of
being) when addressing environmental and social injustice. For example,
Kyle Powys Whyte (Potawatomi) clearly demonstrates the centrality of
settler colonialism, stating that it "can be interpreted as a form of
environmental injustice that wrongfully interferes with and erases the
socioecological contexts required for indigenous populations to
experience the world as a place infused with responsibilities to humans,
nonhumans and ecosystems" (Whyte 2016:3, unpublished manuscript,
https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2770058). [Consequently, [as the systems
that reinforce set]{.mark}tler [col]{.mark}onialism [persist and
spread]{.mark} through]{.underline} imperialism and globalized
[capitalism, [social and ecological relationships that support

to]{.mark} maintain and [improve]{.mark} ecological [well-being, can
instead act as an arm of]{.mark} [set]{.mark}tler [col]{.mark}onial
destruction]{.underline}. [Therefore, [practitioners and
scholars]{.mark} nested [within]{.mark}]{.underline} environmental
[[institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}, organizations, and governments,
[[especially those based in the imperial core of the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates, [have an undue responsibility to]{.mark} engage all

coloniality-based narratives of wilderness in US Arctic policy," The
Polar Journal 12.2, 2022, pp.198-214)

[The themes identified throughout]{.underline} the different [policy
documents]{.underline} as described above represent two key takeaways.
The first is that the way that the wilderness is conceptualised in these
documents changes over time -- illustrating the United States'
simultaneous interest and disinterest in the region.Footnote36 However,
while these narratives and themes may vary in nature, they [all rely on
coloniality at their core]{.underline}. If [these [narratives
are]{.mark}]{.underline} so sticky in nature to **[[how the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [creates Arctic
policy]{.mark}]{.underline}**, then [[they constrain how and if
the]{.mark} United [State]{.mark}s [can act
differently]{.mark}]{.underline}. The second is that because [this
[coloniality]{.mark}-based understanding]{.underline} of nature
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} quite [[clear across]{.mark} a variety [of
different admin]{.mark}istration[s]{.mark} [and time periods]{.mark}, we
can ascertain that **[the United States' autobiographical sense of self
is colonial]{.mark} in nature**]{.underline}. Thus, coming back to OSS
-- [the state]{.underline} activates and deactivates narratives to fit
exogenous events into its sense of self -- and crucially, that self [is
based on coloniality -- meaning that long-standing patterns of colonial
power remain alive in the modern world.]{.underline}Footnote37 Although
words such as 'frontier' and 'savage' are not used as they were in
earlier years of American wilderness imaginings, the ways of thinking
about the wilderness as harsh, diminishing, and mainly as a place for
extraction remains the same. If [American [policies]{.mark} are [rooted
in these ideas]{.mark}, it severely [limit]{.mark}s [how the]{.mark}
United [State]{.mark}s [can]{.mark} act in ways that reframe the region
as]{.underline} one of lacking extractive practices, and as [an
opportunity for climate cooperation that [consider]{.mark}s [Indigenous
needs]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This has implications for how successful
the United States can really be when promoting Arctic agendas.
[Coloniality]{.mark}]{.underline} exhibits itself in many narratives --
but [[is]{.mark} particularly [visible in framing the wilderness as a
place for extractive]{.mark}]{.underline} and economic
[[opportunity]{.underline}]{.mark} evokes ideas of ecological
imperialism.Footnote38 Taming the wilderness, or in other words
[[changing what is 'unusable' into 'usable' resources to be extracted,
is colonial]{.underline}]{.mark} in nature. However, rather than
traditional colonial practices of extracting and leaving the region,
**[the [set]{.mark}tler [col]{.mark}onial aspect]{.underline}** --
remaining in the region for the long term and settling -- **[[is
omnipresent in how the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [thinks
about]{.mark} its [Arctic engagement]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [[This has
implications for]{.underline}]{.mark} how the United States will treat
areas like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and [[the extent to
which the]{.mark} United [State]{.mark}s [will honour
agreements]{.mark}]{.underline} considering environmental protection and
conservation in the face of potential economic gains. It is important
here to note, while these implications stand, historically there is
little to no demonstration of economic opportunities such as the ANWR
being acted upon. In fact, there is a long history of Congress's failure
to approve economic development in the ANWR and approval is quite
recent. Here, perhaps it may be interesting to point to other factors
explaining this lack of demonstration of economic opportunities such as
the persistent role of environmental activism. [Another example of this
coloniality comes from considering the idea of the Arctic diminishing
and its relation to coloniality, importantly focusing on the disavowal
of settler guilt]{.underline} and blame and the myth of pure
wilderness.Footnote39 Again, this has consequences for American Arctic
policy. [[When blame is removed from the settler]{.underline},]{.mark}
for example, [particularly as it relates to climate change, [the
Arctic]{.mark} region [becomes]{.mark} more [open to
extraction]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the 21st century, [[this translates
to opportunities to extract critical minerals, oil and gas]{.mark} for
energy security purposes, [and fish]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[[Treating]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[wilderness as
harsh]{.underline}]{.mark} and unwelcoming similarly [has colonial
implications and consequences for]{.underline} how the United States
formulates [policy]{.underline} and acts [in the Arctic.]{.underline}
The idea of [harshness falls back on the myth of pure wilderness as
above and [extends the idea of]{.mark} harshness and [savagery to the
Indigenous People that live there]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Both [people
and land are treated as]{.mark} an ['Other']{.mark}]{.underline} that is
inherently created [in opposition to the]{.underline} land and people of
the [coloniser]{.underline} society. [Consider the fact that food
insecurity rarely comes up in American security documents, despite being
a security reality for many Indigenous People in Alaska]{.underline}.
These narratives weave in and out of American Arctic policy documents,
coming back to the idea that in the context of the United States, the
wilderness has no concrete definition. Instead, it operates as a window
for scholars to better understand how the concept of the wilderness is
instrumentalized by the state.

Fugitive Aesthetics in Sámi Artists Lena Stenberg's Exhibition Borders
(2023) and Pauliina Feodoroff's Performance Matriarchy (2022) Kristine
Nielsen Art History, Illinois Wesleyan University, Chicago, IL, USA
ABSTRACT How does contemporary Sámi visual art address land rights,
sovereignty and reclaim Sámi histories? This paper explores the work of
two contemporary Sámi artists, Lena Stenberg's exhibition Gränser
(Borders), from 2023, and Pauliina Feodoroff's performance Matriarchy,
staged at the 2022 Venice Biennale. The essay views their work through
the lens of a "fugitive aesthetic," a concept that defines a resistance
to Settler colonial practices through escape from dominant narratives.
Stenberg and Feodoroff confront colonial borders and return the land to
the Sámi pictorially and, in Feodoroff's case, materially through her
decolonial project with the non-profit organisation Snowchange. Their
defiant "escape" takes place from within the institutions of the
contemporary artworld but with the goal of disrupting their containment
and prioritising Sámi sovereignty. KEYWORDS Sámi; Lena Stenberg;
Pauliina Feodoroff; Matriarchy; Borders; fugitive aesthetic; resistance;
sovereignty How does contemporary Sámi visual art engage with ideas of
sovereignty and land rights and what artistic strategies might help
advance these goals? The work of two contempor- ary Sámi artists, Lena
Stenberg and Pauliina Feodoroff, will demonstrate distinct visual
proposals for ways to culturally reclaim and sustain Sámi ways of living
and knowing. Lena Stenberg's solo exhibit Gränser (Borders) was first
shown at the Nordic House in the Faroe Islands (20 February--5 March
2023) and then at the Sámi Center for Contem- porary Art/Sámi
Dáiddaguovddáš (SDG) in Kárášjohka/Karasjok, Norway (22 April--18 June
2023). Stenberg employs three-dimensional and two-dimensional work to
address Sámi lived experiences and reestablish the presence of her
Gárasavvon/Karesuando ancestors forced to relocate due to the creation
of national borders by the Nordic nation states. Skolt Sámi artist
Pauliina Feodoroff's project Matriarchy, a performance at the Sámi
Pavilion at the 2022 Venice Biennale, advocates for and, in fact,
implements decolonialism by protecting the Arctic woodlands of Sápmi.

https://doi.org/10.1080/02560046.2024.2430475 through violence, Settler
colonialism may use a gradual process of Indigenous erasure through
institutional policies and systems that require their assimilation.
Viewing Sámi contemporary [art through]{.underline} the [lens of
**Settler colonialism** invites an **[exploration]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
a "**[fugitive aesthetic]{.mark}**,"]{.underline} a term described by
scholars of Indigenous studies Jarret Marti- neau and Eric Ritskes as
[[resisting]{.mark} full **assimilation** to **[colonial]{.mark}
[thinking]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Indigenous visual art [[**interrupts**
and **unsettles**]{.mark} the **[colonial
narrative]{.mark}**]{.underline} by providing a "fugitive Indi- geneity"
that creatively negates a Settler colonial worldview (Martineau and
Ritskes 2014, ii, iv). The term "[[fugitive]{.underline}]{.mark}" [has
its own history in [**scholarship** denoting]{.mark} escape, nomadism,
and **[resistance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Film and media scholars Bruce
Bennett and Katarzyna Mar- ciniak, for example, frame refugee
experiences depicted in cinema as a fugitive aes- thetic that engages
with bordered thinking, flight, and migration (Bennett and Marciniak
2022). Earlier use of the term fugitive derives from Black studies
critically analysing postcolonialism and histories of slavery. Here
fugivity concern acts of refusal, evasion, and resistance aiming to
escape structures of oppression. Activist Stefano Harney and cultural
theorist Fred Moten, for example, use the term fugivity to portray
practices and spaces that live beyond the reach of formal institutions,
such as academia, and invite alternative ways of thinking and being
(Harney and Moten 2013, 25--43). \[F\]ugivity is being separate from
settling. It is a being in motion that has learned that 'organ- izations
are obstacles to organising oneselves' and that there are spaces and
modalities that exist separate from the logical, logistical, the housed
and the positioned, as stated in their book's foreword (Harney and Moten
2013, 11). Here [fugivity operates [as]{.mark} a [position]{.mark} [to
**stake out**]{.mark} physically or **[conceptually]{.mark}**
[that]{.mark} [escapes **dominant narratives** by **creating
spaces**]{.mark} [beyond the existent ones]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Martineau and Ritskes' concept of fugitive Indi- geneity brings in the
visual arts through the creative refusal to comply to a colonial
mindset. In a fugitive aesthetic, the visual artist flees from
institutional containment and commodification, deliberately avoiding
assimilation into the spaces of dominant culture. [They sustain
Indigenous identities and memories that resonate for the Indigenous
communities rather than an external audience]{.underline}. Thus, while
nomadism, displacement, and bordered thinking are key concepts in the
work of Stenberg and Feodoroff, I will argue that a fugitive aesthetic
conceived as creative negation proves equally important to their work.
While scholars have placed Stenberg's artistic practice in the context
of art history and identity (Grini 2017) or globalisation and local
spatial identities (Bergmann 2014), scholars on Feodoroff's performance
Matriarchy have focused on its feminist and envir- onmentalist advocacy
and claim for independence (García-Antón 2022) including its subversion
of the capitalist consumption of resources (Williamson 2023). This essay
contributes to current scholarship by viewing Stenberg's work Mobility
(2014) and Laavu (2019) and Feodoroff's Matriarchy (2022) through the
lens of a fugitive aesthetic of escape, Sámi relational memory, and the
importance of place. These two artists con- front colonial borders and
return the land to the Sámi pictorially and, in Feodoroff's case,
materially through her decolonial project with the non-profit
organisation Snow- change. Their defiant "escape" takes place from
within institutions of the contemporary artworld but with the goal of
disrupting their containment and prioritising Sámi sovereignty. 2 K.
NIELSEN Resistance through a Sámi worldview: Lena Stenberg's Borders
Sámi artist Lena Stenberg (b. 1961), originally from Leavas Sameby
outside Giron/Kiruna, in northern Sweden, uses [sculpture, installation,
and photomontage to explore themes of home and migration]{.underline}.
She belongs to the Gárasavvon/Karesuando Sámi, raised in a family of
reindeer herders closely tied to the land and natural environment. Her
most recent exhibition Gränser (Borders, 2023) [[renders]{.mark}
**[intimate]{.mark}** the impact of **[national border con-
struction]{.mark}**]{.underline} between Norway and Finland in the early
20th century and its effect on her Sámi ancestors. It explores her
family's connection and disconnection to the Sápmi areas, now in Finnish
and Norwegian territories, and how Settler colonialism and nation-state
building severed their ties to the land. Her artistic process involves
[[appro- priating]{.mark} old photographs from ethnographic [archives to
**reconfigure** them]{.mark}]{.underline}. Using photo- montage, she
adds the photographs of her ancestors to the picture plane, usually in a
depicted Sámi landscape, and [[**metaphorically** corrects
**colonial**]{.mark} **histories** and [erasures]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Earlier Sámi artists have also sought to redress family history,
including Katarina Pirak Sikku's lengthy project Nammaláhpán (2014).
Where Sikku explores the photographic archives of Sámi ancestors in
Uppsala's State Institute of Race Biology, Nils-Aslak Valkea- pää
reclaims ethnographic photographs of Sámi ancestors from European
archives in his 1988 book Beaivi, áhčážan (The Sun, My Father). Their
artistic processes involve gathering pictorial fragments to restore a
shattered collective memory. In contrast to her two- dimensional work,
the implications of a fugitive aesthetic emerges more strongly, I
believe, in her three-dimensional projects, which resemble
[**[functional objects]{.mark}**, such as a sleigh with luggage,
[conveying]{.mark} **[mobility]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**[displacement]{.mark}**]{.underline}, or the tent called lávvu in
Northern Sámi. The conical shape of Stenberg's wooden sculpture
Mobilitet (Mobility, 2014) (Figure 1), also featured in her Borders
exhibit, represents the Sámi tent lávvu. The lávvu, typically covered
with reindeer hides and, more recently, with heavy fabric, serves as a
mobile shelter for the nomadic Sámi, as they journey alongside their
herds of domesticated rein- deer. But the tent represented in Mobility
lacks cover and therefore proper shelter as a domicile. Instead, its
[open frame [invites]{.mark} [investigation]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the
[structure]{.mark} and scattered com- ponents [attached]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} the **[vertical poles]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Upside down
and sideways wooden chairs, stools, utensils, side tables, and a canoe
paddle interlock with vertical poles using mortise and tenon joints. The
furnishings appear weightless and mobile compared to the load- bearing
poles critical for tent's stability and durability. While some of the
objects, such as the paddle, reflect items important for Sámi
communities living near rivers and lakes where fishing and
transportation by water are essential for daily life and survival, other
objects convey furniture from a more stationary abode. A side table, for
instance, derives from a life of permanence in modernity. Notably,
however, since the floating fur- niture and household items do not
contribute to the structural integrity or essential func- tionality of
the tent, they point to their superfluous, if not cluttering existence.
Western tourism and histories of nationalism have fabricated an image of
the tent, including both the lávvu and the Native American tepee, as
signifying metonymically the Indigenous as a collective. In this
colonial visual language, the lávvu is easily substi- tuted for the Sámi
people. The title Mobility leads the mind toward a Sámi nomadic life-
style of reindeer herding represented by the lávvu. Moveability defines
the nomadic lifestyle, requiring a functionally compact dwelling to
easily adapt to life on the move. CRITICAL ARTS 3 But I argue that
Stenberg's sculpture conceptually reverses what one might deem mobile
and transient, too. Even if most Sámi no longer live nomadically, it
remains relevant as a frame of reference. "A modern nomad is what I am.
My home is within me," says Stenberg. "We probably still carry that
mobility within us" (Stenberg 2014, 74--75). Stenberg further references
Nils Aslak Valkeapää's 1985 book Ruoktu Váimmus (Trekways of the Wind),
which addresses how one's home refers to the landscape, one's
experiences, spirituality and culture. I contend that Stenberg's work
Mobility conveys how the Sámi tent serves as the very foundation, the
backbone for the concept of home in a Sámi collective ima- ginary,
visually evidenced by the load-bearing poles in the sculpture. Because
the often-modern furnishings in her sculpture appear weightless,
decorative, non-supportive, and therefore inconsequential, they suggest
that we reconsider the weight of these items in a Sámi mindset.
[Mobility evokes not only a transient reindeer herding lifestyle but
also a fundamental Sámi **[worldview]{.mark}** [functioning]{.mark}
[as]{.mark} the [underlying structural support]{.mark} [for]{.mark} the
**[conception of home]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The sculpture is therefore
both tent and vision of the world, an inner landscape and enduring
presence. More felt than formally acknowledged, [a **resist- ance**
[against]{.mark} **[Settler colonialism]{.mark}** resides]{.underline}
in all her work. Stenberg's exhibition Borders was first shown at the
Nordic House in the Faroe Islands (20 February--5 March 2023) which held
a series of ten exhibitions entitled Sápmi Stories showcasing thirteen
Sámi artists (Sissel Mutale Bergh, Outi Pieski, Birit Haarla, Katja
Haarla, Lena Stenberg, Máret Ánne Sara, Anders Sunna, Michiel Brouwer,
Katarina Pirak Sikku, Liselotte Wajstedt, Lisa Vipola, Hanne Grete
Einarsen and Tomas Colbengtson). The themes of the series concerned art
history's "monocultural worldview" and how Figure 1. Lena Stenberg,
Mobilitet, 2014, wood (Photo credit: Lena Stenberg). 4 K. NIELSEN
Eurocentric art history traps the concept of beauty in an "exclusionary
system" of aes- thetics that omits minority cultures such as the Sámi
(Sørensen 2022, 11). Art history tends to relegate Sámi art to the realm
of Indigenous art or folklore, says the curator, hereby confining art
through language. To counteract this confinement, the Nordic House asked
the invited Sámi artists to expand our ways of experiencing art
(Sørensen 2022, 12). Stenberg's work speaks to this diversion between a
Eurocentric art historical vision focused on dominant culture and a Sámi
challenge to this structure, as I will demonstrate next with her second
sculptural iteration of the lávvu, from 2019. Lavvu (Figure 2) is made
of red-painted metal with only the structural poles visible. It appears
like a sturdy armature for a tent. Its brightly coloured, stream-lined
and indust- rially-made form removes the sculpture from its traditional
wooden material, evoking a mass-produced commodity instead, like a
modular, pre-fabricated home personalised through colour choice. In the
gallery space, Lavvu's principal reference speaks to art his- tory's
modern aesthetic with its clean lines and primary colour, mimicking the
formal language of modern art. Looking at Lavvu again, however, one
notices how two pole lines extend beyond the body of the sculpture and
onto the floor uniting in a looped metal honda knot. From this
viewpoint, the clasp turns into a slider and the curved lines of the red
metal transform into a lasso in motion creating the illusion of a line
in the air made by the lasso. The lávvu and lasso are hereby visually
and conceptually joined in association and function: The lávvu now
evokes the lasso used in the summer- time and autumn when Sámi reindeer
herders catch the calves with their lassos to mark them (Lena Stenberg,
email to author, March 29, 2024). Where the lassos used to be made of
rope, today they are brightly coloured plastic, as represented by the
red colour of Figure 2. Lena Stenberg, Lavvu, 2019, painted metal (Photo
credit: Lena Stenberg). CRITICAL ARTS 5 Lavvu. Red, alongside yellow, is
also the colour that symbolically moulds the Sámi land and Sámi being,
as Sámi scholar Liisa-Rávná Finbog notes (Finbog 2024, 54). Stenberg's
sculpture thus references a tent, a modern work of art, and a memory
archive of Sámi embodied events. Lavvu [**[expands]{.mark}** our
**[perceptions]{.mark}** of what we are experiencing, [unfolding]{.mark}
a **[creative rupture]{.mark}** that leads us [to]{.mark} a [**tacit
realm** that draws on **place**]{.mark}, **memory**, **relations**,
[and]{.mark} **[practices]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Viewers knowledgable
about Sámi reindeer herding find themselves trans- ported from the
gallery space to the Sápmi community. It is a [**[fugitive
move]{.mark}**, a flight [away from]{.mark} a **[confined
aesthetic]{.mark}** and [toward]{.mark} a **[space of freedom]{.mark}**
that **cannot** be recuperated by the gallery or "**European aesthetic
paradigms**,"]{.underline} to use the words of Martineau and Ritskes
(2014, ix). Lavvu transforms before our very eyes the moment one thinks
from and with Sámi ways of knowing and living, changing sense
perceptions from the act of looking to remembering embodied, tactile,
and relational Sámi experiences. Place lies at the very heart of
Stenberg's work and strategy in terms of exhibition sites and subject
matter. She chose to exhibit Borders on the Faroe Islands, an autonomous
ter- ritory within the Kingdom of Denmark subject to a history of Danish
colonialism, and later at the Sámi Center for Contemporary Art/Sámi
Dáiddaguovddáš in Kárášjohka/Karasjok. Moreover, much of her work takes
place outside the gallery space and in nature. For example, her 2023
work Nomad, built and situated outside, represents an old Sámi settle-
ment's drying racks with braided surfaces. She views the act of creating
as deeply con- nected to the land and derived from Sámi knowledge
systems. Even when Stenberg approaches the concept of place from within
the art institution, such as in her Borders exhibit, she explores ideas
of dwelling and displacement, including the forced relocations of her
Gárasavvon/Karesuando ancestors and the photographs of them taken by
tourists and anthropologists in Romssavággi/Tromsdalen between 1860 and
1930 (Stenberg 2022). Borders reflects critically on a Nordic history of
border building that began with the Lapp Codicil of 1751: The Codicil
was an appendix to the initial border treaty between the Swedish-Finnish
and Danish-Norwegian kingdoms, which honoured the nomadic Sámi's rights
to move freely across national borders (Institutet för språk och folk-
minnen n.d.). But tensions between reindeer herding and agriculture grew
increasingly with Settler colonialism in the early 19th century. By
1852, Russia had sealed the border between Norway and Finland resulting
in the Sámi losing access to pastures and fishing on the Arctic coast.
Then, in 1889, Russia closed the Swedish-Finnish border to the nomadic
Sámi. In the 1920s and 1930s, Sweden further displaced many Northern
Sámi southward, a process referred to as bággojohtin (Institutet för
språk och folkminnen n.d.). Stenberg's relatives were among those
displaced, and [Borders poignantly highlights these
displacements]{.underline}. She layers photographs of Northern Sámi
individuals, often relatives, alongside their geographic locations in
two-dimensional spaces, at times arranging the space in a chessboard
pattern, symbolising the strategic pursuit of Sápmi lands for con- quest
(Figure 3). Stenberg focuses on cultural survival of the Sámi and
visually restores her relatives' presence in Sápmi in a way that
resonates with, yet differs significantly, from Sámi artist Pauliina
Feodoroff's project Matriarchy to which I now turn. Pauliina Feodoroff's
decolonial project Matriarchy Artist, filmmaker, theatre director, and
writer Pauliina Feodoroff (b. 1977) is a Skolt Sámi from Inari in the
Finnish (Če'vetjäu'rr) and Russian (Suõ'nnjel) regions of Sápmi. As the
6 K. NIELSEN former President of the Saami Council, Feodoroff has been
actively engaged in Sámi land and water access rights both as a
spokesperson and activist. She [combines art and stew- ardship of the
land reflecting a Sámi holistic **worldview** [centred on relations and
**mutual exchange**]{.mark} [between **people** and]{.mark} the
**[land]{.mark}**]{.underline} (García-Antón 2022, 5--6). In 2020, the
Office of Contemporary Art Norway commissioned Feodoroff to exhibit at
the Nordic Pavilion recast as the "Sámi Pavilion" for the 2022 Venice
Biennale. The curators offered the primary space to three artists Máret
Ánne Sara, Anders Sunna, and Feodoroff who would have the chance to
"claim a sovereign space" symbolically, states co-curator Liisa-Rávná
Finbog (Office of Contemporary Art Norway n.d.). The opportunity to
appeal to art collectors and museums at the Venice Biennale led
Feodoroff to accept the commission. At the Sámi Pavilion, Feodoroff
showed Matriarchy (2022, 90 min), a performance in three acts with seven
performances in total for the duration of the Venice Biennale season.
The opening act, entitled "First Contact," begins with a procession of
six Sámi women exhibiting to the audience outside of the Sámi Pavilion
their duodji, or Sámi hand- crafts representing elements of Sámi
knowledge and traditions (Figure 4). They show the audience various
objects and foods integral to Sámi ways of living such as grass and
lichen, an algae-fungi that reindeer graze on (Rubin 2022). Once the
performers move inside the pavilion, they place the duodji gifts on the
floor, and two women dance in silence in a choreography that evokes a
back-and-forth exchange but also suggests Figure 3. Lena Stenberg,

the dancers dressed in all-black may represent a crow standing in for
the colonial nation, as Norwegian art historian Camila Mørk Røstvik has
suggested (Røstvik 2023, 395). Eventually, additional dancers arrive
with long ribbons on banners, and the energy of the performance
intensifies with the addition of sound. Music by Sámi musicians Anna
Morottaja, 169 (Mio Negga), and Mari Boine provides the backdrop for
this part of the performance turned suggestively political. Boine's 1994
song "Mun Da'han Lean Oaivámuš" ("I Am in Command") concerns borders and
the effort to establish control when these borders are ignored or
breached. Like in Sten- berg's exhibition Borders, the song and
Feodoroff's performance denounce the borders that arose with the
building of nation states, which displaced Sámi families and obstructed
access to their livelihoods. "First Contact" initially imagines a
mutually respect- ful meeting between the Indigenous and recent Settlers
but closes on an agitated note when Settler colonialism breaks these
relations. In part two, "Auction," the performers stage a mock auction
of landscape portraits with a real auction happening offsite for museums
and collectors. The landscapes depict Indi- genous territories and
reindeer habitats threatened by deforestation and mining, particu- larly
in Skolt Sámi regions but also areas in North America. The auction
offers the landscape portraits as art for sale, encouraging collectors
and institutions to acquire Figure 4. Pauliina Feodoroff, Matriarchy,
2022, performance (Photo credit: Andreas Haglund). 8 K. NIELSEN the art,
not the land. The actual auction ushers the purchaser into a novel
relationship with the artist by establishing a dual obligation of care
and support. In this arrangement, the buyer receives the landscape
portrait and scheduled visitation rights to the land, while committing
to its preservation and rehabilitation, hereby becoming an ally in Sámi
prin- ciples of reciprocity and stewardship (García-Antón 2022, 12).
When Feodoroff's perform- ance was not taking place, the Sámi Pavilion
exhibited the landscape portraits as videos. In the videos, the camera
slowly tracks the landscapes captured by Sámi artist Outi Pieski, with
the scenes narrated in English and representing a Sámi collective "we"
(the land and associated guardians) imploring the viewer to support the
rewilding project (Office of Contemporary Art Norway n.d.). The third
and final part, titled "Matriarchy," affirms [rematri]{.mark}ation as
key to envisioning a sovereign Sámi future. [[Indigenous
**matriarchies**]{.mark} are societies that centre around the mother,
including Mother Earth, and emphasise **matrilineal qualities** by
[prioritis]{.mark}in[g]{.mark} the values of **[equality]{.mark}**,
peace, [and]{.mark} a **[reciprocal duty of care]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
In part three, a gathering of Sámi women and their allies engage in
collective healing through actions that reject the colonial inheritance
by leading through nurture. "It has always been the female that lead,"
Feodoroff's father says, "The Reindeer, the people, always the older
female" (Feodoroff 2022, 187). [The **[framework]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
**[rematriation]{.mark}** [accepts]{.mark} the [land not as property but
as a place for a **community**, underscoring a shift from]{.mark}
individual [possession to **rela- tional belonging**]{.mark} and
stewardship.]{.underline} Handwritten on a landscape portrait depicting
rein- deer and herders, Feodoroff's concluding words urge the audience:
"Don't buy land that is not yours" (Figure 5). Feodoroff's project at
the Venice Biennale not only displays Sámi landscape but---in a
fugitive, separate space beyond the art institution---it reclaims Sámi
land, and not as a metaphor. Her prior and concurrent land and river
projects effectively decolonialise the land through a novel strategy
that restores land governance to its original stewards through
acquisitions in the private market. Feodoroff works with the Snowchange
Coop- erative, a non-profit organisation that aims to shield northern
Finnish land from further deforestation. It has promoted the rewilding
of the land and the leveraging of Sámi knowledge for ecological
restoration since the 2010s (Feodoroff 2022, 237). Snowchange restores
the biodiversity and the Indigenous ownership in the area using an
initiative called the Landscape Rewilding Program. The decolonial
process includes also renaming the purchased lands in the Skolt Sámi
language. For example, the Skolt Sámi community renamed one site Čuhč
člåå'ddrääuhvää'r (A Hill Where the Capercaillie Will Be Left at Peace)
to restore livelihood to the Capercaillie, a forest bird with a
declining population due to the loss of its habitat in northern
coniferous forests (Rubin 2022). Loans and donations from the European
Investment Bank, Dutch bank Triodos, alongside donations from various
Finnish organisations, the Google Foundation, and Christensen Fund have
made it possible for Feodoroff and Snowchange to purchase private lands
in far northern Finland (Rubin 2022). At this point, Snowchange has
rewilded over 50000 hectares of land and has become Finland's
second-largest ecological restorer (Rubin 2022). Ultimately, the goal is
to return the land and forests to a Sámi community or village able to
carry out the oversight of the lands (Mustonen and Feodoroff 2021, 237).
Feodoroff's artistic strategy both engages with and disengages the
capitalist system. Her performance at the Venice Biennale strategises
the standpoint of viewing "art as capital, and currency as resistance,"
as Katya García-Antón, the former Director for the CRITICAL ARTS 9
Office of Contemporary Art Norway, states (García-Antón 2022, 13).
Accordingly, Feodoroff participates in the capitalist tactics of the
artworld: she is the artist selling her artwork to art museums and art
dealers, the Museum of Modern Art in Helsinki being the first of several
purchases of the landscape portraits. But her Venice Biennale proceeds
have supported Snowchange's purchase of 40 hectares of woodland (Rubin
2022). As a result, and in line with a fugitive aesthetic, she turns the
system on its head by purchasing Sápmi land with the monetary gains.
[The **[rupture]{.mark}** she generates [shifts]{.mark} [from]{.mark}
the [individual]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the [collective]{.mark}, from the
contemporary artworld to Sápmi, from com- modity to nature]{.underline},
with the goal of reinscribing Sámi presence legally both within and
outside the control of state institutions. While her decolonial project
escapes being fully contained by the art institutions and sus- tains
Sámi ways of living through decolonialism, challenges persist. The act
of reclaiming ter- ritory remains a struggle, because the Finnish
constitution continues to interfere in the connections between Sámi
families, animals, and lands. Private and state lands are the only two
forms of land ownership permitted in Finland today. Moreover, Finland
recognises the Sámi as an Indigenous peoples, but it does so without
affording them rights to tra- ditional livelihoods (Kuokkanen 2019,
88--89). It has yet to endorse the Indigenous rights Figure 5. Pauliina
Feodoroff, Matriarchy, 2022, performance (Photo credit: Andreas
Haglund). 10 K. NIELSEN outlined in the International Labour
Organisation (ILO) Convention 169 introduced by the United Nations. The
ILO 169 distinguishes between minority rights and Indigenous rights by
framing the latter in terms of collective rights of a people. Viewing
the Sámi as a collective would acknowledge the rights of Indigenous
peoples to their lands (Henriksen 2008, 10). But the Finnish government
views the Sámi in Finland as a very small ethnic minority, instead,
bereft of legal entitlement to reindeer herding rights or land rights
(Kuokkanen 2019, 79). Like Stenberg, Feodoroff is acutely aware of the
colonial history of Sápmi, which she traces to the year 1542 when the
Swedish King Gustav I Vasa subjugated the Finnish and Sámi wilderness
and traditional Sámi community of the siida or sijdd in Skolt Sámi. This
occupation then set the precedent for all the governments that followed,
so that the Sámi have effectively lost their land rights ever since
(Mustonen and Feodoroff 2021, 232). The Skolt Sámi have been caught in
border conflicts with neighbouring nations for centuries. When Finland
ceded to the Soviet Union in 1945, the Skolt Sámi either stayed in
Finnish Peäccam/Petsamo or relocated from their ancestral lands to start
a new life near Lake Aanaar/Inari (Feodoroff 2022, 170). Aside from the
shifting national borders, Settler colonial practices have affected the
Skolt Sámi areas through Soviet-imposed land collectivisation, nickel
mining, and Finnish forestry and river regulations, which have further
forced the Skolt Sámi off their land (García-Antón 2022, 5). Layered
upon this history are the local environmental disasters such as acid
rain and the contamination from Chernobyl, the aftermath of which
greatly affected Sápmi and Skolt land (García- Antón 2022, 6). These
historical and environmental factors propel the urgency of Feo- doroff's
artistic and activist practices in sustaining Sámi survival and
sovereignty. The struggle for sovereignty It is no coincidence that the
photographic landscape portrait of Sámi land figures as a key trope for
both Feodoroff and Stenberg. The concept of the landscape is in itself
an histori- cal invention closely tied to imperialism and power, as
exemplified by European land- scape portraits emerging alongside
colonialism in the 1600s to the 1800s (Mitchell 2002, 5--7). Similarly,
cartographic maps aided in territorial expansion by presenting Indi-
genous land as a blank slate. Sweden and Denmark-Norway, for example,
mapped Sápmi to establish territorial claims and secure trade routes
(Ojala and Nordin 2019, 99--100). Just as early modern mapmaking
practices omitted Sámi communities from their land depic- tions, so
today the Sámi are still often seen as barriers to ignore in the pursuit
of monetary initiatives such as mining and forestry. In the late 1800s
and throughout the 1900s, pho- tography served as the vehicle through
which ethnographers, scientists, missionaries, and tourists documented
the native Nordic landscape and lay visual claim to it. Taking the
photographic landscape, Stenberg and Feodoroff employ a fugitive
aesthetic by using the idea of the Western landscape against itself and
reinscribing Indigeneity in the act. Feodoroff's Matriarchy turns the
Western landscape portrait on its head by first appealing to a European
aesthetic paradigm of fine art objects and then instrumentalising the
pur- chase of the landscape portrait as a social contract. In this
social contract, the purchaser acquires the picture and gains scheduled
visitation rights to the land but, importantly, also pledges to preserve
and restore it. Resistance lies in the very act of unconventionally
generating a social contract of care within the structure of capitalism.
Stenberg's Borders project traces the footsteps of her Sámi ancestors
and their habitats through her CRITICAL ARTS 11 photomontages. Her
black-and-white montage Giððajohtin (Spring Migration), 2023, shows Sámi
ancestors before their forced relocations, but it is the landscape that
domi- nates. She pictorially restores the land to its original owners
using the historical photo- graphs derived from the archives of
anthropology and tourism of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. I
have demonstrated how two, contemporary Sámi artists go beyond reviving
Sámi culture by applying creative strategies that expose power dynamics
and escape from being subsumed by colonial thinking. [They imagine an
elsewhere, a separate space, **[defined by resistance]{.mark}** and a
sense of freedom and mobility.]{.underline} Feodoroff circumvents the
art- world's monetary and object focus by acquiring Sámi land piece by
piece, opening an opportunity for these very institutions to enter a
social contract with Sámi communities. Stenberg prevents her art from
being fully contained by the gallery, creating an elsewhere of
alternative experiences resistant to the European aesthetic paradigm.
Both artists choose to reside in Sápmi, often working in nature and away
from the global art scene. Their independence is indicative of a greater
development in contemporary Sámi art where artists increasingly bypass
institutional intermediaries to establish independent platforms for
themselves through access to production. Nonetheless, the progress
remains challenging. Sámi platforms, such as The Sámi Center for
Contemporary Art, still rely on federal support and larger funding
initiatives that retain a relationship of dependence (Hætta 2024, 128).
Moreover, the threat of reappropriation remains for Sámi artists and
their work. Máret Ánne Sara, for example, challenged land exploitation
and reindeer herding policies when she installed her work Pile o' Sápmi
outside the Indre Finnmark District Court in Norway in 2016. However,
since then, the risk of her work's co-optation by cultural institutions
requires Sara's consistent navigation. Pauliina Feodoroff's Matriarchy
is no exception either. The Venice Biennale platform provides her with
access to the dealers and museums with purchasing power, but she must
plea for their involvement, effectively reinforcing a colonial dynamic.
Amid these challenges, artists like Feodoroff and Stenberg continue to
[[move **beyond the bounds**]{.mark} and compre- hension [of]{.mark} the
[colonial]{.mark} [mindset]{.mark} and toward **reinscribing** Sámi
presence in Sápmi [through]{.mark} a **[fugitive

**[[Decolonization]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- [in]{.underline} this [case
of how in/security is understood in the **circumpolar
Arctic**]{.underline} -- is thus an analytical and normative goal of
this project. It is important to note, however, that decolonization does
not and cannot mean returning to a precolonial reality; the cognitive,
material, and affective legacies of colonialism may be repaired, but
they can never be undone. As such, decolonization "does not mean and has
not meant a total rejection of all theory or research or Western
knowledge. Rather, [it is [about]{.mark} **[centring
\[indigenous]{.mark}**\] concerns and **[worldviews]{.mark}** and then
coming to know and understand **[theory and research]{.mark}** from
\[indigenous\] perspectives and [for]{.mark} **\[[indigenous\]
purposes]{.mark}**]{.underline}."136 Indigenist research seeks to bring
indigenous peoples' views back into the realm of knowledge production
from which they have typically been excluded. Such an understanding of
the possibility and limits of decolonization will not satisfy those who
call for decolonization to be applied literally to settlercolonial
political, social, and economic systems and institutions currently
extant on Indigenous lands, and who decry the use of "decolonization as
metaphor ... because it turns decolonization into an empty signifier to
be filled by any track towards liberation." These critics argue that
"decolonization in the settler colonial context must involve the
repatriation of land simultaneous to recognition of how land and
recognition of land have always been differently understood and enacted;
that is, all the land, and not just symbolically."137 On such terms,
decolonizing the foreign and security policies of settler-colonial
states is an oxymoron; real decolonization would involve fully
disassembling settler societies' power over indigenous peoples through
the restoration of all settler-occupied territories to the descendants
of their original inhabitants. This literal view of decolonization is
rejected in this dissertation as neither a useful starting point nor
even a desirable objective for political or academic praxis. Such a
maximalist and literal conception of decolonization elides profound
normative questions 136 Tuhiwai Smith 1999, 39. 137 Eve Tuck and K.

original. 51 regarding the future of native-born settler descendants and
more recent immigrants inhabiting indigenous lands, and offers no
reasonable starting point for political negotiation, cooperation, and
reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples. Instead,
this dissertation employs an understanding of decolonization that
aspires towards a post-colonial politics capable of guiding social
scientific inquiry and informing meaningful political change, rather
than contemplating an impossible restoration of pre-colonial reality. It
seeks to bring the voices and views of Indigenous peoples in the Arctic
to the same page as the perspectives of Arctic states, incorporating the
original inhabitants of the circumpolar region into a discourse of
Arctic security from which they have been excluded. In outlining
possible parameters for an indigenist research agenda, Tuhiwai Smith
identifies 25 different projects that comprise a comprehensive research
program for indigenous peoples. The projects have both empirical and
methodological goals, namely to incorporate indigenous knowledge and
indigenous knowledge production into academic research: The projects are
not claimed to be entirely indigenous or to have been created by
indigenous researchers. Some approaches have arisen out of social
science methodologies, which in turn have arisen out of methodological
issues raised by research with various oppressed groups. Some projects
invite multidisciplinary research approaches. Others have arisen
directly out of indigenous practices ... Most fall well within what will
be recognized as empirical research, \[but\] not all do.138 As a
non-indigenous person, and moreover as a privileged, male member of
settler-colonial society in Canada, one of the Arctic states under
examination in this dissertation, some of these research projects are
unavailable to me. It is neither possible nor would it be appropriate
for me to engage in claiming, naming, or giving testimony to indigenous
experiences. Other projects such as revitalizing, restoring, and
returning indigenous practices, language, culture, or territory are
beyond the scope of this dissertation. However, elements of three
indigenist projects are contained within this research, and can be
meaningfully and appropriately contributed to by me as a non-indigenous
scholar examining indigenous political issues: Indigenizing consists of
two dimensions: "The first one is similar to that which has occurred in
literature with a centring of the landscapes, images, languages, themes,
metaphors, and stories in the indigenous world ... \[The second\]
centres a politics of 138 Tuhiwai Smith 1999, 142-143. 52 indigenous
identity and indigenous cultural action ... grounded in the alternative
conceptions of world view and value systems."139 Representing: "The
representing project spans both the notion of representation as a
political concept and representation as a form of voice and expression.
In the political sense colonialism specifically excluded indigenous
peoples from any form of decision making. State and governments have
long made decisions hostile to the interests of indigenous communities
... [Being able as a **minimum right** to **[voice]{.mark}** the views
and opinions of [indigenous]{.mark} communities [in]{.mark} **various**
**[decision-making bodies]{.mark}** is still being struggled
over]{.underline}."140 Reframing: "[**Reframing** is about
[taking]{.mark} much **[greater control]{.mark}** [over]{.mark} the
[ways in which **indigenous issues**]{.mark} [and]{.mark} **[social
problems]{.mark}** [are]{.mark} **[discussed]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**[handled]{.mark}**]{.underline} ... The framing of an issue is about
making decisions about its parameters, about what is in the foreground,
what is in the background, and what shadings or complexities exist
within the frame. [The project of reframing is related to **[defining
the problem]{.mark}** or issue [and]{.mark} [determining]{.mark}
[how]{.mark} best **[to solve]{.mark}** that problem]{.underline}."141
To be sure, this dissertation presents detailed examinations of the
Arctic policies of two circumpolar states. As such, it could be said to
(re)produce the conceptions of Arctic in/security employed by settler
societies that have marginalized, instrumentalized, and oppressed
Indigenous peoples in the region. However, the dissertation also
provides the first detailed case-based and comparative analysis of the
views of Arctic Indigenous peoples towards the meaning of in/security in
their homelands. In doing so, it builds upon and contributes to recent
literature, especially in Canada, that centres indigenous peoples in the
foreign and security policies and practices of the states in which they
reside.142 This project thus reframes the way in which 139 Tuhiwai Smith

105-119. 53 issues vital to Indigenous peoples -- such as environmental
change, linguistic and cultural preservation, natural resources, and
self-government -- are typically understood by policymakers and academic
audiences in the metropolitan south of Arctic states. In doing so, it
represents those issues that Indigenous peoples have articulated as most
pressing to their continued survival and wellbeing as security issues,
extending the theoretical logic of socially constructing in/security
beyond states and privileged national actors to include Indigenous
peoples. And in examining the ways in which Indigenous views of Arctic
security have not been successfully incorporated into the foreign and
security policies of circumpolar states, it indigenizes that discourse
and challenges it to account for the exclusion of Indigenous views. As
an academic study rooted in interpretivist, Western social scientific
methodology that also considers the views and practices of settler
states, this is at best a hybrid indigenist research project. However,
it aspires to contribute towards the decolonization of how Arctic
security is understood through the deliberate and focused incorporation
of those indigenous voices that have been silenced or subsumed. Perhaps
once the discourse has been decolonized, the policies and practices of
Arctic states will follow.

[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [[educational policy]{.underline}]{.mark} and
practice via the emphasis on individual achievement. The simple fact
that terms like "achievement," and, of course, the "achievement gap" are
still widely used illustrates the ways that individual achievement is
discussed and valued more than collective learning and well-being.

An example where this interconnectedness was missing is the Global
Climate Strike, held on September 20, 2019. Organizers estimated that on
that Friday, four million children and young people were in the streets
on every continent, calling for the cessation of climate change harms
that they were positioned to inherit.34 While the call to change and for
world leaders to take responsibility for future generations was
certainly a success in terms of its size and clear message, only in a
few locations did protesters discuss land and Indigeneity. This is even
more striking when considering the strong, extended Dakota Access
Pipeline protests at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation beginning in
2016. As part of establishing a site for the Water Protectors, learning
was a necessity. Mní Wičhóni Nakíčižiŋ Owáyawa, The [[Defenders of the
Water]{.mark} **[School]{.mark}**]{.underline}, was located in the
Očhéthi Šakówiŋ Camp at Standing Rock. The school

[about]{.underline} and [through]{.mark} [**[traditional]{.underline}**

[fell under the radar]{.underline} of most mainstream media outlets, ﻿and
if history is any predictor, is unlikely to be noted in K--12 history
textbooks that address this particular example of resistance and study.

[**[Colonialism]{.mark}** [has]{.mark}, instead, [**specific** ideas for
what **counts**]{.mark}]{.underline} and how to achieve success. For
example, when achievement is upheld as the key standard rather than
learning, it brings with it a toolkit of measurements, remediation
programs, expulsion policies, and meritocratic explanations of who
achieves and how. The [[federal education policies]{.underline}]{.mark}
No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top, [versions]{.underline} [one
and two]{.underline} all [[echo]{.underline}]{.mark} the idea of
**[[linear improvement]{.underline}]{.mark}** while pursuing and lauding
competition and individualized achievement.

[[Movements]{.mark} [of]{.mark} protest and
[struggle]{.mark}]{.underline}, in their many different shapes,
[[have]{.mark} **[included]{.mark} [study]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[This
phenomenon]{.underline} [preceded]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} oft-referenced [[civil rights
movement]{.underline}]{.mark}, dating back to struggles of communist
activists in the early twentieth-century South. As Robin D. G. Kelley
documents in Hammer and Hoe, the Alabama Communist Party, composed
largely of [[poor Black workers]{.underline}]{.mark} [and]{.underline}
some white [allies]{.underline}, [pushed a multifaceted agenda for
relief from racism, classism, and patriarchy]{.underline}.35 Although
the [majority]{.underline} [of]{.underline} [people]{.underline} in this
collective [[would be deemed semi-literate]{.underline}]{.mark} in a
strict sense of the word, [[they]{.mark} [still]{.mark}
managed]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [[study
together]{.underline}]{.mark}, in churches and then through wider
organizing groups, with the goal of exchanging ideas and forging
collectives for action. Although the specific contexts of time and place
are deeply important to each movement for justice, it is also
[important]{.underline} [to note that movements]{.underline} of study
and struggle [can]{.underline} also [serve as palimpsests across
movements]{.underline}.

The contemporary [**[B]{.mark}**lack]{.underline}

movement [[has been **calling out**]{.underline}]{.mark} militarized
[anti-Black]{.underline} **[[police brutality]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a
pervasive racist culture, and the ongoing pillage of the land for
profit. On the face of it, this movement ﻿seems to have sprung up
spontaneously, but as with most collective demands for justice,
[[people]{.underline}]{.mark} [have]{.underline}

example of this study is found in the platform issued by the Movement
for Black Lives.36 Black Lives Matter is a large, decentralized social
protest. From these protests, the [[Movement]{.mark} [for Black

[[provide]{.underline}]{.mark} political
**[[education]{.underline}]{.mark}** and policy demands [for
Black]{.underline} [lives]{.underline}. The platform, launched in 2016
and since then revised on an ongoing basis, begins with the over-arching
first plank, "End the War on Black People."37 It includes several policy
demands, among them the end to the surveillance of Black youth and the
assault on Black women. The demands, which number more than a dozen, are
presented as intertwined, meaning that [[addressing]{.mark} just **[one
vector of oppression]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
incomplete and [**[inconsistent]{.underline}** [with]{.underline}
[how]{.underline} [oppression]{.underline} [works]{.underline}
[through]{.underline} **[multiple]{.underline}** [delivery]{.underline}
[systems]{.underline}]{.mark}. One of the most poignant points is a call
for the end to equating violations of property with the extinguishing of
human life. Throughout the platform's references to struggle, that act
is not equated with "looting," which the platform deftly dismisses
without ever giving the racialized use of that word any space. The
[platform itself is a form of **public pedagogy**]{.underline}, one that
is specific, freely available, and constantly edited and
[informed]{.underline} [by]{.underline} [collective]{.underline}
[gatherings]{.underline} [to address]{.underline} the [**nuances**
of]{.underline} the [assault on Blackness]{.underline}.

[In social movements throughout history, out of necessity, study and
struggle have been intimately linked. In the 1960s, the Student
Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (**[SNCC]{.mark}**)
[prioritized]{.mark} **[debating]{.mark}** every single **action** in
[group meetings]{.mark}.38 From deciding how to **understand**
communities and their disenfranchisement to how to raise interest and
willingness to risk physical harm for the right to vote, every decision
was debated]{.underline} and often ﻿informed by shared readings of
radical thinkers SNCC had undertaken as a group. For example, when
someone approached SNCC proposing to photograph their actions, the group
debated their reservations about how the photographs would be used and
the value of having their work made more visible. [[This debate was
within]{.mark} [the]{.mark} **[context]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
[SNCC's]{.mark} [commitment]{.mark} [to]{.mark} archiving their work to
[ensure]{.mark} its [accuracy and impact]{.mark}]{.underline}. Just
about any person can register for a New York public library card; sign
up for a time to read through Ella Baker's papers, housed in the
Schomburg Center for Black Studies; and for no fee, learn from the
minutes of SNCC. [**[This]{.mark} access** [is]{.mark} itself [a
**political** act,]{.mark} [an]{.mark} [opening]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
**[learn]{.mark}**, **[free of tuition charge]{.mark}**, lab [fees, and
**credit requirements**]{.mark}.]{.underline} As stated throughout the
online digital archive of SNCC (also freely available), the organization
also used photography to provide incontrovertible evidence that their
approach to social transformation was to learn about the everyday lives
of those whose civil rights were restricted through various racist
codes. How SNCC walked alongside people was a mode of organizing itself,
and their documentation of this is an act of public pedagogy.39 What is
not so readily available in the online archives, though, is the robust
debate about whom the organization should receive funding from and how
they should receive it. These debates are documented, in line-by-line
transcriptions of SNCC's meetings, also housed in the Schomburg Center.
They shed light on how the SNCC was primarily focused on civil rights,
particularly the right to vote, but also how the group discussed many
facets of the nation and the globe, including the movements happening in
nations far away. In other words, they studied racism and colonialism as
ways to inform their actions.

SNCC members read and discussed classic works by the first prime
minister and president of Ghana, the pan-Africanist Kwame Nkrumah, ﻿the
scholar and educator Carter G. Woodson, and Harriet Tubman, with a focus
on her practices of literally stealing back Black lives from slavery.
They researched the areas of the nation where particular obstacles made
it all but impossible for Black Americans to vote. For the members of
SNCC, the research led to empirical knowledge of how the daily
activities of Black Southerners included spaces of ease and, more
poignantly, barriers to voting and enacting their civil rights. For many
Black and Chicanx student groups in the 1960s, [political]{.underline}
[study]{.underline} [was]{.underline} first [about]{.underline}
**[achieving]{.underline}**
**[self]{.underline}**-**[determination]{.underline}**, [in]{.underline}
both the [individual]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[collective]{.underline} [sense]{.underline}, and [achieving
self-edification in an **anti-Black** **settler state**]{.underline}.
These investigations often led to further study that helped to connect
the struggles of marginalized peoples in the United States to those
living in other colonized states. Important work by W. E. B. Du Bois and
Claudia Jones consistently connected economic power structures across
nations, particularly in their impacts on Black peoples on the African
continent and beyond.40

[[An]{.underline}]{.mark} [[important component of the
study]{.underline}]{.mark} pursued by these groups
[[involved]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[working]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[closely]{.underline} **[[alongside]{.underline}]{.mark}** different
[[peoples]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[with]{.underline}]{.mark} [[whom
they]{.underline} **[shared]{.underline}**]{.mark} [many]{.underline}
**[[racialized]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and]{.underline}
[**[gendered]{.underline}** [identities]{.underline}]{.mark}. For
contemporary social movements on college campuses, much of [[joining
**together**]{.mark} and [organizing]{.mark}]{.underline} has come
through the dissonance, if not harm, that
**[[BIPOC]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as [[students]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[experience]{.underline}]{.mark} [[encountering]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [curricula]{.underline}, [symbols]{.underline}, [and **[building

[men]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[who]{.mark} **[oppressed]{.mark}**
[their]{.mark} **[ancestors]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Many scholars and
activists have cautioned against submitting political demands through
stories of pain, as it is far too easy and common for colleges to
respond by prescribing listening sessions and not making material
changes. However, it is also true that when student activists decry
statues and building names, it challenges whose history has been
concretized as objective ﻿and central, as well as challenging the
colonizing process through which knowledge is sanctified. When
minoritized students are asked to learn from largely Eurocentric
knowledges, they are rightfully dismayed at discovering what, precisely,
they have signed up for. An approach to study that is at once disruptive
and grounding, and often extends beyond higher education's curriculum,
has meant and should mean many things. [[When]{.mark} [students]{.mark}
of varying class]{.underline}, [race]{.underline}, [gender]{.underline},
ability, and sexual identity [**[come into contact]{.mark}**
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} [[a]{.underline} [form]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} **[study]{.underline}** [that]{.underline}]{.mark}

**nation** and world]{.underline}, [[they]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[undergo]{.mark} a **[significant]{.mark}**
[transformation]{.mark}]{.underline} [in]{.underline} [[how]{.underline}
[they]{.underline} **[understand]{.underline}**]{.mark} themselves in
relation to [[the world]{.underline}]{.mark}. A lingering question is,
[[when]{.underline} **[white]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[[students]{.underline}]{.mark} from middle- and upper-middle-class
homes [[experience]{.underline}]{.mark} [[learning]{.mark} [that]{.mark}
**[disrupts]{.mark}** the **[narratives]{.mark}**]{.underline} [they've
been]{.underline} [told]{.underline} about meritocracy and the American
dream, **[[what follows]{.underline}]{.mark}**?

Although understanding systemic racism addresses some questions about
the treatment that BIPOC, queer, and working poor students experience on
campus, understanding settler colonialism leads to a different set of
questions: [How could study **not** involve **struggle**]{.underline}
[for]{.underline} [those]{.underline} [in a nation forged through theft
of land]{.underline}, [in an economy based on racist
capitalism]{.underline}, and [amid]{.underline} the [ongoing attempt to
**erase Indigeneity**]{.underline}? Why are existing relationships to
land and neighborhoods rarely discussed in the proposals to expand large
universities in urban areas? Why and how is heteropatriarchy perpetuated
through curriculum and through campus cultures? What is the
**[relationship]{.underline}** [between]{.underline} [**Native
sovereignty** and **Black freedom struggles**]{.underline}? Most
fundamentally, [[how has]{.underline}]{.mark} [[colonialism]{.underline}
**[limited]{.underline}** [our]{.underline}]{.mark} very
[[idea]{.underline}]{.mark} [[of]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[achievement]{.underline}]{.mark}** and [[what it means to

[spaces]{.mark}**]{.underline}? [It has]{.underline}, in essence, [told
us [the]{.mark} **[lie]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} the
[information]{.mark}]{.underline} taught in various disciplines
[[contains]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[objective]{.mark}

[[for]{.underline}]{.mark} a precious **[[few]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Settler [colonialism]{.underline} [has attempted to **commodify

[[Understanding]{.mark} [set]{.mark}tler **[col]{.mark}onialism** as an
**ongoing** structure]{.underline} [[provides]{.underline}]{.mark} a
more **[[robust]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[route]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[understanding]{.underline}]{.mark}** how
various [populations]{.underline} [experience]{.underline}
**[[distinct]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[but]{.underline}]{.mark} deeply
[[connected]{.underline} [forms of
**marginalization**]{.underline}]{.mark} from formal institutions in the
United States, including higher education. Those [distinct]{.underline}
[forms]{.underline} [of]{.underline} [marginalization]{.underline}
explain [why]{.underline} **[gaining access]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} **[study]{.underline}** [has]{.underline} had [to
involve **both** internal **political education**]{.underline} and
external public teachings, with attempts to [shift]{.underline} the
shared [imaginary and material **realities** for Native
peoples]{.underline}.

In 2018, 23 percent of Native Americans and Alaska Natives ages eighteen
to twenty-four were enrolled in college, compared with 57 percent of
white youth enrolled.41 While there had been significant growth of
Native Indians and Alaska Natives enrolled between 2008 and 2015, those
numbers have dwindled in recent years. Within that enrollment, there
were roughly three times as many Native women as men, a gap roughly two
times greater than the gender gap for Black Americans. These statistics
and history matter when we pause to remember that
**[[every]{.underline}]{.mark}** postsecondary [[institution of learning
**sits upon**]{.mark} [what was **once** sovereign]{.mark}
**[Indigenous]{.mark}**]{.underline} **[[land]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
often under a matriarchal system. And what is arguably more important,
that **[[land was treated as]{.underline}]{.mark}** a

**[elder]{.underline}**, **[parent]{.underline}**,

**[[concerning]{.underline}]{.mark}** trend, and [part of what has
created]{.underline} a culture of property and [**uneven** **power** in
higher education]{.underline}, dating back to the Morrill Acts of the
nineteenth century, which parceled out seized Indigenous lands from the
federal government to establish land grant institutions, a complex web
of commodification further ﻿explored in chapter 2. Should they be
admitted to institutions of higher education, [[students]{.underline}
[from]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[marginalized

[[students]{.underline} [have to]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[deal]{.underline} [with]{.underline}]{.mark} what is colloquially
referred to as [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
"**[[tax]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[they]{.underline}]{.mark} must

#### Indigenous knowledge production has historically been obscured and ignored in favor of Western intellectual authority which has resulted in false conclusions and epistemic violence 

**Martin, 2023**

(Peter R. - Assistant Professor in Cultural and Historical Geography @
University of Nottingham, "The 'deer-men' and the 'bowhead-men': The
colonial co-optation of Arctic Indigenous knowledge within the 'origins
of the Inuit' debates," Transactions of the Institute of British
Geographers, 49.1, 2024, article first published 22 May 2023,
https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tran.12615)

This article has provided further evidence for the increasingly
recognised fact that Indigenous peoples contributed various types of
knowledge to the geographical discipline throughout its historical
development. [As ongoing research is making clear, [the vital role
played by Indigenous peoples in the]{.mark} historical [formation of
knowledge]{.mark} about our world [has]{.mark} regularly [been silenced,
obscured or ignored]{.mark}]{.underline} (Martin, 2020). Here, Nocum
provided Dall with various forms of geographical knowledge pertaining to
the Indigenous inhabitants of the Beringia region. Yet Dall avoided
giving the impression of an overreliance on this Indigenous informant
[[due to the risk it]{.mark}]{.underline} may [have [posed
to]{.mark}]{.underline} his own **[[intellectual
authority]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Instead]{.underline} he invoked
[[racist arguments]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[diminish the credibility
of]{.underline}]{.mark} Nocum\'s [[claims]{.underline}]{.mark} and
called into question his intellectual authority while at the same time
increasing and bolstering his own status as a reliable and credible
scholar. Nocum\'s role in providing this information was thus carefully
manipulated within Dall\'s retelling of these events which has meant his
contributions have been omitted within historical retellings of the
'origin of the Inuit' debates. [This and similar processes have
therefore resulted in the skewed understandings]{.underline} of the
historical emergence of the geographical discipline as we understand it
today. [More importantly though, the article has identified [the racist
and imperialist logics]{.mark} bound up [in]{.mark} these historical
[debates]{.mark}]{.underline}. As both Smith (2021) and Livingstone
(2008) have made clear, [debates]{.underline} on human origins [have
regularly [result]{.mark}ed [in]{.mark} **[profoundly]{.mark}**
problematic and]{.underline} often [**[erroneous conclusions]{.mark}**
regarding human difference,]{.underline} and the debates pertaining
specifically to Inuit were no exception. [Yet [such
debates]{.mark}]{.underline} nonetheless [played a powerful role in
fomenting and reproducing problematic depictions of Arctic inhabitants,
depictions which were then disseminated across wider scholarship and
which in turn shaped public understandings]{.underline}. Dall\'s
writings undoubtedly played a part in [[reproduc]{.mark}ing]{.underline}
these troubling [[racialised imaginaries of Arctic
peoples]{.underline}]{.mark} and only now is his large body of work
beginning to receive due critical interrogation. As a final point, it is
vital to remember that the **[[colonial knowledge-making
practices]{.underline}]{.mark}** discussed here [[**cannot be
separated** from the]{.underline}]{.mark} various forms of **[[colonial
violence]{.underline}]{.mark}** that were to **[be [exerted upon the
Indigenous peoples of the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}** on both sides of
the Bering Strait in the years that followed. The various forms of
[[scholarly knowledge pertaining to]{.mark} Arctic [Indigenous
peoples]{.mark}]{.underline} produced and circulated during this period
[[had direct]{.mark} and far-reaching [consequences for
how]{.mark}]{.underline} contemporary and future [[colonial regimes
enacted]{.mark} their political [power]{.mark}]{.underline} across the
Boreal regions (Stern & Stevenson, 2006). As is becoming ever more
evident, [the historical legacies of geographical, anthropological and
archaeological investigations in the Arctic are intimately intertwined
with histories of colonial dispossession, imperial control and
violence]{.underline} (Kulchyski, 1993; Rud, 2017; Tester & Kulchyski,
2011). The ways in which [[colonial knowledge]{.mark} regularly [led
to]{.mark} the [dispossession]{.mark} of land and territory, the [forced
relocation]{.mark} of entire communities, [and]{.mark} facilitation of
various forms of **[physical, psychological and epistemic harm toward
the peoples of the circumpolar north]{.mark}** are now]{.underline}
beginning to be [exposed]{.underline} (see, for example, Damas, 2002; de
Leeuw, 2007; Harris, 2020; Loo, 2019; McLean, 2020). The insights
offered by this article seek to support ongoing scholarship that is
investigating, critiquing and destabilising the various colonial and
racist projects that were enacted in the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions
during this period (Barnd, 2017; Coulthard, 2014; Daigle, 2016; Deloria,
1997; de Leeuw, 2016; Smith, 2012; Louis, 2007). To conclude then, [it
is imperative that [scholars]{.mark}]{.underline} continue to study
closely historical moments of Indigenous/non-Indigenous encounter in
order to [gain a more accurate understanding of the ways in
which]{.underline} geographical and other types of [knowledge about our
world have historically been co-produced]{.underline}. But [they
[must]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[focus on the ways]{.mark} in which
these [knowledges were]{.mark} then [co-opted]{.mark} in problematic
ways [to inform]{.mark} all manner of colonial regimes and [imperial
agendas]{.mark}]{.underline}, which had devastating impacts on the lives
of these Indigenous peoples and their descendants. Doing so provides a
vital means by which to understand the historically colonial nature of
the geographical discipline and will shed further light on the ways in
which geographical knowledges have been complicit in facilitating the
damaging and enduring impacts of imperial rule. [[The insights
offer]{.underline}]{.mark}ed in this article therefore offer
[[a]{.underline}]{.mark} potential [[route forward in navigating]{.mark}
the difficult and complex tasks involved in the
[decolonisation]{.mark}]{.underline} of the geographical discipline
today.

[[The Arctic is the ancestral home of diverse Indigenous Peoples, where
they have generated knowledge about]{.mark} their territories,
encompassing natural [environments]{.mark} and reciprocal relationships.
[This]{.mark} profound relationship of Arctic Indigenous Peoples with
their ecosystems [emphasises their crucial role in
research,]{.mark}]{.underline} which holds the potential to impact both
tangible and intangible elements of the natural world. [The history of
Arctic regions is one of [colonisation]{.mark} by domestic and foreign
governments whose policies and practises are still felt today. This,
[coupled with the influx of external researchers, brought unequal power
dynamics between knowledge systems and methodologies, causing harm to
local people and **undermining the quality of**]{.mark} **Arctic
[research]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Indigenous communities and trained
[[Indigenous researchers continue to lead research]{.mark} today.
[However]{.mark}]{.underline}, despite notable shifts in research
methodologies, [the enduring legacy of [colonialism continues to]{.mark}
cast a pervasive [influence]{.mark} over [the]{.mark} entire [research
continuum, from idea to]{.mark} conclusions, implementation, and
**[policy]{.mark}**]{.underline} outcomes. Introduction In this
document, we provide the ICARP IV process with concrete recommendations
for actions that can advance the parity and complementarity of
Traditional Knowledge, Indigenous Knowledge, and academic scientific
knowledge in order to inform the process and lead to better research
outcomes for all. However, this document cannot be used as a universally
applicable one-size-fits-all approach or as rigid, prescriptive
guidelines. The situations of Arctic Indigenous Peoples vary
significantly across the Circumpolar North due to diverse geographical,
environmental, and cultural factors, which influence their distinct
challenges, priorities, lifestyles, and interactions with the changing
Arctic environment. [[Dialogues]{.mark} and relationship-building [are
key to ensure ethical and effective research]{.mark} practices [that
genuinely serve]{.mark} to uplift the status, rights, and roles of
Arctic [Indigenous Peoples]{.mark}]{.underline}. In order to fulfil the
aforementioned commitment, [[Arctic research needs to be
decolonised]{.mark} and Indigenised]{.underline}. [[Decolonial research
translates to moving away from the typical institutional]{.mark} and
researcher-centric [systems]{.mark} towards]{.underline} genuine
[equality in]{.underline} planning and [decision-making on
research]{.underline} strategies, processes, and funding. The inclusion
of Indigenous rightsholders at eye-level in all decisionmaking, planning
and funding of Arctic research, on equal footing with the relevant
institutions at the nation-state level, advances the realisation of
Indigenous Peoples right to self-determination. Selfdetermination is the
right of Indigenous Peoples to independently guide research processes,
ensuring alignment with their values and needs, thereby enhancing the
relevance and impact of research outcomes. [Decolonising research is
crucial for Indigenous self-determination]{.underline} (see: Example 1).
Championing Indigenous Knowledge has also yielded ground-breaking
discoveries (see: Example 2), which would not have happened without
working with Indigenous Knowledge Holders. [Some research inquiries are
most aptly addressed by Indigenous communities themselves.]{.underline}
Overall, [[decolonial research]{.mark} approaches [lead to better
science]{.mark}, better knowledge, improved understanding, [and]{.mark}
better [decision-making]{.mark} results]{.underline}. In light of these
considerations, we have formulated a set of recommendations for the
ICARP IV process.

Ahead", *Haymarket Books,* April 2025, Accessed via University of

[[Colonialism]{.mark} has [forced]{.mark} [Indigenous people]{.mark}s
[to talk, think and organize around land in]{.mark} our
[resistance]{.mark} to ongoing dispossession. [But]{.mark} within
Nishnaabeg culture [there are also responsibilities for]{.mark} the
caretaking of [water]{.mark},]{.underline} and often these reside in the
realm of women or people who give birth. Often in our ceremonies, these
people will sing and pray to water, focusing on expressing our communal
love, dependency and gratitude for Nibi's life-giving qualities. [And
some have become activists. From 2003 to 2017, Elder Josephine Mandamin
led a movement of [water walkers]{.mark}]{.underline}---people who
walked around the Great Lakes, [[drawing attention to the health]{.mark}
and well-being [of]{.mark} the [water]{.mark}]{.underline}. The activist
Autumn Peltier from Wikwemikong has been fighting for access to clean
drinking water for a decade, since she was twelve years old. Mohawk
midwife Katsi Cook teaches us that [[water]{.mark} in our mothers [is
our first environment]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} the health of the [amniotic
fluid that surrounds us]{.mark} there [is]{.mark} directly [related to
the health of the aquifers and lakes]{.mark} that surround us in the
larger world.]{.underline} Meanwhile, Nishnaabeg fasting ceremonies,
which include spending time on the land in the spring and going for four
days and four nights without water, reinforce the idea that we cannot
exist very long without this element.

[[All genders and]{.mark} all forms of [life have a relationship with
water]{.mark}. Water [droplets]{.mark} in our breath [connect us
intimately]{.mark},]{.underline} as we learned during the pandemic.
[Nishnaabeg think of water [as the lifeblood of the earth]{.mark}. We
think of the [Great Lakes as]{.mark} internal
[organs]{.mark}]{.underline} that filter and clean water before sending
it along the Gchi-Ziibing, or the St. Lawrence River, to the Atlantic
Ocean. In this sense, the health of the Great Lakes is akin to the
health of our own kidneys and liver. [We rely upon coastal peoples to
take care of the water in the Arctic, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. We
rely on northern peoples to take care of the permafrost, snow and sea
ice. We rely on Indigenous peoples in deserts and arid regions around
the globe to advise us of the great power that even a little bit of
water holds.]{.underline} We rely on mountain peoples to take care of
headwaters and glaciers. In my own practice, I rely on writers and
thinkers like Christina Sharpe and Alexis Pauline Gumbs to teach me what
Black feminists theorize about the Atlantic and the middle passage.

#### Ancestors work through sounds of rushing water -- wave sound asks us to listen and embody it

**Simpson '25** Simpson is a [Mississauga
Nishnaabeg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississaugas) writer,
musician, and academic; known for her work with "Idle No More", and is a
faculty member at the [Dechinta Centre for Research and
Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dechinta:_Centre_for_Research_and_Learning).
(Leanne Betasamosake, "Theory of Water: Nishnaabe Maps to the Time
Ahead", *Haymarket Books,* April 2025, Accessed via University of
Michigan Library System, DOA: 7/14/2025)//LFS---LMH

[I think of [our ancestors]{.mark}, who [spoke]{.mark} to their
ancestors [through the sound of rushing water]{.mark}. It's one of the
many reasons that hydro [dams]{.mark}, interpretive centres and [lift
locks are]{.mark} so [irritating]{.mark} to us: [they close off]{.mark}
channels of [communication]{.mark}. The sound of [rushing water is
a]{.mark} kind of [portal]{.mark} to another world.]{.underline} Places
where waves of energy altered human hearing were often where spiritual
beings lived or where certain significant events happened. [And the
sounds in these places, such as that of water moving, were
normalized.]{.underline} The idea that Belmore would have to stop us and
amplify the sounds so we could hear them would be startling to these
ancestors.

While the relevance of Ayum-ee-aawach Oomama-mowan still resonates
today, the work also gave birth to siblings in 2017, in a series called
Wave Sound. [[Revisiting]{.mark} [and inverting the]{.mark} concept of
the [megaphone]{.mark}, Belmore made four [sculptures,]{.mark} varying
in shape and form, [to amplify the sound of water and
shoreline]{.mark}]{.underline}. The sculptures were installed in Banff
National Park, Alberta, Gros Morne National Park in Newfoundland, in
Anishinaabe territory at Pukaskwa National Park in Ontario and on
reserve at Chimnissing Island in Georgian Bay, which is part of the
Beausoleil First Nation in Ontario. Three of the 170-pound conical
listening devices were made of aluminum casts, an aesthetic echo of who
the listeners were likely to be in the locations where these three were
installed: non-Indigenous peoples. For the sculpture on reserve land,
Belmore used copper, a material that echoes Anishinaabe history, story
and material use. [[Copper is]{.mark} said to be [the blood]{.mark} of
two groups of Manidoog, or spirits, Animikiig (Thunderbirds) and
Mishibizhiig (the Underwater Panthers), who engaged in an epic battle in
the Great Lakes region, spilling their blood on shorelines and rocky
outcrops. Copper [offers itself]{.mark} to the Anishinaabeg [by making
itself visible]{.mark} on the ground. It is [used to hold water in our
ceremonies, and represents space]{.mark}s [in]{.mark} [between]{.mark}
the [sky]{.mark}, [water]{.mark}s [and land]{.mark}.15]{.underline} To
make the sculptures, Belmore cast the rock in each site-specific
location, rock that was created out of thousands of years of wind, rain,
snow and ice, and then wrapped the castings around conical frames. The
forms were helicoptered into the sites so that visitors would happen
upon them while hiking. These were large-scale, temporary installations,
camouflaged in their surrounds, amplifying the unique sounds of each
place.16

Instead of inviting us to speak, [[Wave Sound asks us to practice
embodied listening]{.mark}---a deep listening and feeling using one's
entire being.]{.underline} [Wave Sound is [an invitation to
gather]{.mark} at the shore, [sit]{.mark} down [and use our bodies to
hear]{.mark} wind, rock, sand---maybe even mosquitoes and the durational
rhythm of waves.]{.underline} Iris Blake writes that Wave Sound gestures
towards listening and disability, with the conical devices functioning
as hearing aids.17 I think that it suggests how settlers under
colonialism have never, ever been able to hear the expansive web of
living things that we refer to as land, just as they have never heard
Indigenous peoples. When I encounter it, even in a gallery setting[[, I
don't look]{.mark} at Wave Sound---although I could for a long time,
because it is aesthetically stunning.]{.underline} [[Instead, I become
enmeshed]{.mark} in Wave Sound, [placing my body on the land to]{.mark}
quiet it, and to [listen]{.mark} [beside]{.mark} Nibi, to listen
[through]{.mark} Nibi, to listen [with]{.mark} Nibi---a being that
changes form from liquid to solid to gas, that travels the skyworld, the
underground, and inside and outside my body, an ancient formation of
molecules that has been the same since the beginning of this world. [A
fugitive that erodes and escapes containment,]{.mark} and one
[that]{.mark} [we]{.mark} simply [cannot live
without]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Loves]{.mark}. As I write those words in this spring moment, in the
middle of a miraculous rebirth of leaves and new-growth
green]{.underline}, I keep stopping at this point in telling this story
that has barely started. I stop because yesterday, a little way along
the Jackson Creek trail, [I was thinking about [the child]{.mark} in me
[asking]{.mark} who made Gzhwe Manidoo, and [how did they exist
before]{.mark} [the world was created]{.mark}? And on that trail, it
occurred to me that this origin story was telling me the answer. It was
telling me that [the precursor to life]{.mark}, and to world building,
wasn't simply a dream or a vision or an intention of something better.
It [was love. Not a fleeting]{.mark} romantic [notion]{.mark},
[but]{.mark} a deep sense of [care, hope, truth and kindness]{.mark}---a
loving any way, and all ways.]{.underline}

[[Before]{.mark} the idea of [the world]{.mark}, before the dreaming,
before the making, before the inspiration, the know-how, the
intercommunal creations, [there was care. There was
love.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[This]{.mark} story [tells us that that love is the necessary precursor
to world building]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[I understand [love]{.mark} encoded in the word gzhwe [as being
unconditional;]{.mark} I understand love as [an organizing force, a
motion and an ethic of caring.]{.mark} I understand love [as]{.mark}
[communal]{.mark}---not bound up in the individual or with the
romantic.]{.underline} And of course, I understand it this way because
this is how Doug understood it. [As an ethic that is animated within our
relations, and]{.underline} from there [propels customs of kindness and
generates empathy and systems of care for all forms of life]{.underline}
that make up our world. [[It is not a structure]{.mark} [that negates
emotions]{.mark}]{.underline} or normal responses [[to the violence of
colonialism]{.mark}, responses that might include anger and resentment
and even violence. [Love in this form is a re-enactment,]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} like all such practices it can be wholeheartedly
manipulated and exploited under colonial rule[. It can be
conditioned,]{.mark} manipulated [and weaponized.]{.mark}]{.underline}

OTHERWORLDLY ICE GEOGRAPHIES [Historically, [ice geographies]{.mark}
have been [consistently]{.mark} [described as "unearthly,]{.mark}"
"otherworldly," and "celestial" [by imperial
explorers]{.mark}]{.underline}.67 Explorers wrote of ice geographies as
spectral and supernatural spaces--- eerie, unfamiliar, and unlike
anything they had experienced in their more temperate nation-states.
Apart from aesthetic and affective renderings by those foreign to ice
geographies, polar spaces have been materially entwined with the cosmos.
[Through the discovery of comet dust in Antarctica to the very element
of water first coming to Earth in an icy form through comet landing,
[ice and outer space find themselves]{.mark} consistently
[linked]{.mark}]{.underline}. Ancient intellectuals and contemporary
thinkers look to the stars and the poles to make sense of the globe's
geography, of whiteness, and of philosophy and science. Before
nineteenth-century polar exploration, legends of mythic Hyperborea and
Arktikos as outrageous geographies wherein roamed beasts, monsters, and
strange human-like races were mainstays of Greek storytelling. [[Greeks
narrated]{.mark} the mythological geography of [Hyperborea as a secret
Eden]{.mark}, a circle of fertile, temperate climate located [in]{.mark}
the center of [a frozen wasteland]{.mark}. [Nazi ideology]{.mark} later
took up and [deployed]{.mark} not just [Hyperborea]{.mark} but [also saw
Antarctica as rich narrative ground for a white, severe
continent]{.mark}. Hyperborea specifically was chosen by the Third Reich
as a [pristine, fertile, and untouched]{.mark} landscape surrounded by a
blanket of whiteness and as the locale [from which the purity of the
Aryan race emerged]{.mark}.68 [The North Pole]{.mark}, [in addition to
being part and parcel of white-nationalist-masculinist desires]{.mark}
of its first discovery, [is bound to Europe's scientific
revolution]{.mark}.]{.underline} When understood as a celestial pole or
pole star, the North Pole can be read as one source for locating the
origins of a Western scientific sense of time and orientation in and
navigation through space. When one is not positioned in the high North
and navigating by the North Star, all other celestial bodies seem to
revolve around the North Pole's stationary spatial locatedness in the
sky. Geographical situatedness is key, for as Michael Bravo writes, some
Inuit living in the high North do not treat the North Star, or
Nuutuittuq, in the same way; because of the North Star's high elevation,
it is not a useful constellation for navigation.69 Some Inuit use
constellations or skymarks that are more conducive to their own
practical navigations. Today, [[ice geographies are utilized as
landscapes of simulation]{.mark} [for actual otherworldly
expeditions]{.mark} and excursions. [Ice is being hunted]{.mark} across
the solar system to evidence the potential for human survival on other
worlds and sought after by the wealthiest elite on the
planet.]{.underline} In the summer of 2021, many citizens of Earth
observed several rockets launch into space. From the United States,
three billionaires all fired rockets into the atmosphere. In 2023, an
ice-hunting rover was sent to the moon to obtain a more accurate
assessment of lunar ice amounts and "how much of it will be accessible
to humanity." 70 In 2021, nasa cut a tencent check to kick-start moon
mining technology, the first payment on a space resource contract to
collect lunar dust, volatiles, and water-ice. The reporting article on
nasa's lunar resource extraction support stated that the check "sets a
legal precedent for companies to go out and collect resources from the
lunar surface and make them basically useful for humanity."71 We also
see the logic of "usefulness for all humanity" unfold in the newest
version of the space race as filtered through capitalist logics. As
Bloomberg reports, "China, US Are Racing to Make Billions from Mining
the Moon's Minerals." 72 [And yet, those [industrialized nations]{.mark}
and individuals who are most reliant on fossil fuel extraction on planet
Earth [seek water-ice on the moon]{.mark}, and with every rocket launch
they expel up to three hundred tons of carbon dioxide into the upper
atmosphere where it can remain for years, quickening the pace of
[melting ice on the planet]{.mark} [we]{.mark} all currently
[inhabit]{.mark}.73 [These initiatives destroy ice on Earth while
seeking ice on earthly satellites. The figure of the hero never
dies.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Ice is dialectical at its core -- filled with contradictions that drive the impossibility for it to be coopted by colonial practices and that colonial practices will only cause certain death and demise because of ignorance of native understandings of cooperation with land

[In a similar fashion with other agentic materialities across this
chapter, [Native peoples around the Arctic have]{.mark} long imagined
and [produced]{.mark} [knowledge]{.mark} [regarding their relationships
to the Arctic and to ice]{.mark} geographies. Fred [Bigjim]{.mark}, for
instance, from Sinrock and Nome, Alaska, writes in his poem "Ice
Floe,"]{.underline} Sitting here, waiting for a seal, I become
hypnotized By the ice floe To a point where I don't feel the cold, Or
care how hard the wind blows. I sit here being coy and bold. The ice
moves back and forth, Moaning, screeching, and screaming. It is as
though the ice itself is alive Lecturing me, Trying to tell me its
meaning. Telling me that I must work hard to survive. I watch the ice
move, Hiding and protecting Resources I need. The ice floe watches me,
It sounds like it's laughing. Underneath the ice floe, Sea creatures
feed I sit on top, Waiting. Sitting on the ice is my lifestyle, My
culture, My being. Overhead, watching me, is a crow. Ice---beautiful,
pure, Dangerous, and freezing. My life is so involved With the movement
Of the ice floe.56 Bigjim's poem [[chronicles an interaction between
hunter, ice, seal, and crow.]{.mark} [Ice has depth; it makes choices,
it sings, and it screams.]{.mark} All subjects of this poem are
watching, which offers the reader multiple perspective experiences. [The
hunter watches]{.mark} for the seal, [sea creatures]{.mark} feed and
[are attentive]{.mark} to what might be above the ice waiting for them,
the crow watches from on high, and [the ice watches and audibly
remarks]{.mark} on all that unfolds]{.underline}. The landscape of this
ice floe is dynamic and active. Each piece turns on the behavior and
expectation of the other(s). [A reader might recognize some of the more
common, [romanticized]{.mark} [characterizations of ice]{.mark} such [as
"beautiful, pure, / Dangerous, and freezing]{.mark}."]{.underline}
However, these lines in Bigjim's poem do not mete out the same meanings
as when delivered by a temporary visitor. [[Ice is not to be trifled
with; it is dangerous and requires]{.mark} an [attention]{.mark} and an
awareness that is ever present]{.underline}---that one must work hard to
survive. Warren Miaraq Jones discusses similar tenets in his essay "The
Philosophy of the Circumpolar North," wherein he writes, "[The arctic
and subarctic are unforgiving for those who don't understand them. [If
you don't understand and respect the environment it will take your
life]{.mark}. [Modern technology]{.mark} and life [delude]{.mark}
[people]{.mark} into a false sense of security.]{.underline} This land
will still kill you."57 This philosophy is not meant to dramatize the
severity or reinforce a hard-edged masculinity of ice geographies but is
one that proffers an orientation to landscape through a set of laws and
relationship that have been honed, refined, and upheld over time. Tanya
Tagaq writes, "The Land has no hierarchy. The Land has no manners; you
only obey and enjoy what is afforded to you by her greatness. Only logic
and great care ensure your survival. Only patterns of skills gifted by
our ancestors keep us living . . . we obey or we succumb."58 Bathsheba
Demuth's writing aligns in saying, "In the Arctic, such attention is not
an option but is necessary, and it yields appreciation for the
precarity, the contingency, of simply being."59 Jones writes in another
essay about this formulation as a particular kind of Yup'ik awareness,
drawing from Harold Napoleon's writing on yuuyaraq, or "the way of the
human being."60 Jones states, "[Our laws were known by all, and every
Yuk was responsible for holding themselves and others accountable to
yuuyaraq laws and structures. Yuuyaraq is the product of thousands of
years of wisdom from people living and learning the lessons of the
North]{.underline}."61 This Yup'ik sense of awareness is formulated in
co-constitution with the land and its particularities, making it
resonate with Bigjim's offering that an Inupiaq life is "so
involved / with the movement / of the ice floe."

#### The arctic is not white -- physically, ice is blue, deep, and rich; ethnically, the arctic is full of a diverse background of communities that are underrepresented -- recognizing the importance of color towards communities unlocks radical potential of understanding the arctic as a sight of revolution and beauty

In a later show, from April to late July 2019, Simpson exhibited her
series called Darkening at the Hauser & Wirth gallery in New York City.
This exhibit, also featuring ice imagery, was inspired by a conversation
with and poem by Robin Coste Lewis titled "Using Black to Paint Light:
Walking through a Matisse Exhibit Thinking about the Arctic and Matthew
Henson[." An excerpt from this poem was projected on a wall at the
gallery, framing the exhibit. It reads, [The unanticipated shock: so
much believed to be white is actually---strikingly---blue. Endless
blueness. White is blue. An ocean wave freezes in place. Blue. Whole
glaciers, as large as Ohio, floating masses of static water.]{.mark} All
of them pale frosted azuls. It makes me wonder---yet again---[was there
ever such a thing as whiteness?]{.mark} [I am]{.mark} beginning to grow
[suspicious]{.mark}. An open window. I am blue. I am a frozen blue
ocean. I am a wave stuck cold in midair. [The wave is nude beneath her
blue dress. Her skin is blue]{.mark}.]{.underline}74 Inspired by Lewis's
stress on the color blue, Simpson's Darkening series delivers an
overwhelming palette of deep, deep, deep blues (see plates 4--6). [[Blue
washes over images of icebergs and Black women]{.mark}---sometimes their
silhouettes, other times their eyes or other parts of their faces.
Craggy, [ice-filled landforms appear]{.mark} at times [subtly]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} in other pieces only [in portions]{.mark}. The atmospheric
dimensions of the work are [palpable with gray-blue clouds]{.mark}
pluming [in the dark purple-blue landscape]{.mark}.]{.underline} Cutouts
of text from Ebony magazine again punctuate many of the canvases by
superimposition and screen print. A tall stack of Ebony magazines
installed within the gallery among the canvases line the walls.
[Throughout the Darkening series, [slices of vertical text and the eyes
and faces of Black women peek through]{.mark} images of [dark blue
icebergs]{.mark}.]{.underline} Aisha Sabatini Sloan reflects on
Simpson's ice series, writing, "[Lorna Simpson has been painting
glaciers. [Human-sized, cataclysmic. Eviscerated ice overlaid by a deep
blue wash]{.mark}. Tumbling ash, full spectrum of gray. Volcanic clouds.
Nothing whatsoever warm . . . [these paintings gut. They are unfurling
and torn open. A wound before the blood comes]{.mark}.]{.underline}"75
In Lewis's and Simpson's world(s) created in the exhibit, darkness
envelops in deep blues and purples nearly black. Lewis and Simpson both
bring Matthew Henson into their conceptual focus---an African American
explorer on board seven voyages to the North Pole. In 1909, Henson,
along with four Inuit guides (Iggianguaq, Sigluk, Odaq, and Ukkujaaq)76
as well as Robert Peary, are said to be the first individuals to reach
the North Pole after eighteen years of attempts. Lewis and Simpson
reread these moments for the experiences of a Black Arctic that Henson
may have had. Normative histories often omit Henson in favor of Robert
Peary, with Inuit interlocutors also erased. It wasn't until
posthumously that Henson began to receive recognition. Henson's
autobiography details a narrative that includes descriptions of the
Arctic that are dissimilar from his counterparts.77 Sloan again reflects
on some of those writings: "[Matthew [Henson described his third arctic
winter as full of 'gorgeous bleakness, beautiful blackness]{.mark}.'
[The only light came from the moon,]{.mark} which 'made a fairyland of
the dark valleys, glistening snow and deep, deep
silence.'"]{.underline}78 [[Ice and ice geographies are not
metaphorized]{.mark} by Simpson, Lewis, Henson, or Sloan [as]{.mark}
overwhelming [whiteness]{.mark}. As Inuk artist asinnajaq proclaims,
"The Arctic Is Not White."79 [The Arctic is not racially or
metaphorically white]{.mark}. [The Arctic is Black, and the
Arctic]{.mark} has already been and forever [will be Indigenous]{.mark}.
In her introduction to "Granny Palettes: An Inuit Sense of Colour,"
Taqralik Partridge writes: [Blue and white are often the banner colours
at any conference or trade show about the North, but the Arctic is a
place of many colours: the]{.mark} saturated [fuchsia of fireweed,
the]{.mark} deep [rusts and]{.mark} mustard [yellows of mossy
bogs]{.mark}, [the]{.mark} incredible [turquoise of seawater]{.mark}
around icebergs [and]{.mark} the vivid [orange of suvak]{.mark}---fish
roe. [The light alone]{.mark} [changes]{.mark} [so]{.mark} frequently
that [winter snow may appear orange, pink, or green]{.mark} all in the
same day. Even during the weeks when the sun does not rise, [starlight,
moonlight, and twilight move across the land]{.mark}.80]{.underline}

#### Ice core research is mutually exclusive with indigenous sovereignty as rhetoric of panic and warming creates inhospitability and furthers understanding of desires to extract the arctic for western pleasure and aid while ignoring indigenous history, land use, and practices

that the oldest continuous ice core records extend to one hundred thirty

how [the study of the ice core punctuates dominant, mainstream
understandings of climate science.]{.underline} These narratives
indicate an interest in ice core science as an urgent form of
storytelling that spans far back into the past, informs a critical
present, and helps to model climate futures both on planet Earth and

Expanding Polar Legal Imagination: Speculation and Prefiguration

[As outlined in the introduction, [law is typically]{.mark} a
[reactive]{.mark} discipline; it responds to crises, disputes, or the
needs of states.]{.underline} This is where speculation comes into play,
but how do we speculate (as a practice) with a focus on the polar
regions? [**[Speculative legal praxis invites us to proactively imagine
alternative futures]{.mark}**. This is [not just]{.mark} about
[responding to immediate threats]{.mark} to the polar
environments]{.underline} (environmental law has not managed to do that
in a century of normative developments); [it is about
[rethinking]{.mark} the [legal frameworks]{.mark} themselves,
[questioning]{.mark} their [assumptions]{.mark}, and [envisioning new
possibilities for polar law]{.mark}.]{.underline} One way of doing
speculation is through [[the concept of prefiguration]{.mark}, as a
means of [imagining the future we want]{.mark}. In that sense,
prefiguration [allows us to move beyond]{.mark} the [confines of
existing legal systems]{.mark} and ask fundamental
questions]{.underline}: what is the future of the polar regions we want?
And how do we transpose this vision of the future into a normative
endeavour? Just as the poles are transforming as a result of the climate
and environmental crises, so too must our legal concepts become more
fluid, adaptive, and interconnected. [Traditional categories like
sovereignty, legality, and normativity, which have historically been
fixed and stable, are now being challenged by ecological instability.
[This demands]{.mark} that [we move away from static legal systems
towards]{.mark} more [adaptive legal orders]{.mark}]{.underline}, ones
that can respond to molecular-planetary concerns and ecological limits.
[[Speculative thinking is]{.mark} not simply a means to escape from the
present]{.underline}. It is a [[political praxis to reimagine and
reconstruct]{.mark} legal [knowledge]{.mark} that can respond to the
complex, entangled realities of the polar regions.]{.underline} It
[allows us [to think beyond]{.mark} the [binaries of state vs]{.mark}.
[non-state]{.mark} actors, human vs. non-human interests, and
utilitarian resource extraction vs. environmental
protection]{.underline}. Instead[[, it invites us to consider **a
normative system that respects Indigenous knowledge**]{.mark}, non-human
[sovereignties]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} the [interdependence of all
life]{.mark} forms within these fragile ecosystems]{.underline}. For us,
[to think of [polar law on a speculative register means]{.mark} not just
imagining future scenarios and arguments for legal governance but an
[overall rethinking of ]{.mark}our way of [polar governance
itself]{.mark}.]{.underline} Speculation, in this sense, is not just
about creating fictitious futures but an active, creative and critical
process of prefiguration, as a means to envision the kind of polar
governance we want to see in the future as both a normative and a
political resituating exercise. If prefiguration becomes a political and
normative praxis, then speculative academia becomes the venue for
scholars to politicise.

#### Hyperborean Legalities: Reimagining Polar Law through notions of prefiguration [challenges]{.underline} liminal portrayals of the Arctic and the superiority of state sovereignty\-\--it [deconstructs]{.underline} existing legal realities and unfreezes conceptual spaces of normativity to create visions of coexistence for what law should be

Speculative Academia -- A turn to 'Critical Polar Jurisprudence'

Using prefiguration as a point of analytical departure, we asked
ourselves what is the kind of future that we want to have in the polar
regions? [[Polar Law]{.mark}, as a subset of international law,
[is]{.mark} an artefact [deeply embedded within the sociocultural
paradigm of modernity and is inevitably infected with]{.mark} the
[methodologies and ideologies of this]{.mark} paradigm.]{.underline} The
field of Polar Law as an academic discipline is riddled with doctrinal
and formalist approaches to the Arctic and Antarctic legal issues. As
international law researchers, we are often trained to look for gaps in
our polar legal realities to heal (de lege ferenda), with almost
messianic ambitions, the ills of our global collective social and
environmental factual realities. Polar law is no exception, and
black-letter methodologies abound. [[Even scholars whose research
involves]{.mark} environmental law, [decolonisation]{.mark} or people
liberation movements, whose themes are perhaps more synonymous with a
broad understanding of 'justice', [often frame]{.mark} their [arguments
through]{.mark} a [doctrinal lens to gain
legitimacy]{.mark}.]{.underline} [As we [aim to reimagine polar law in
ways]{.mark} that are [not limited to state modes of existence]{.mark}
but [include humans and more-than-human entities]{.mark} alike in this
process, since August 2022 we have opened the register of speculation to
what we term a 'critical turn' to polar law.]{.underline} In doing so,
we contented that it was perhaps time to think of '[[Critical Polar
Jurisprudence]{.underline}]{.mark}.' In this context, we have been
convening two streams annually at both the Polar Law Symposium14) and
the Critical Legal Conference (CLC). The Polar Law Symposium gathers
researchers from around the globe on an annual basis, [[providing a
platform for]{.mark} the [exchange of research-based scientific
knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}on a variety of issues pertinent
to polar regions. Conversely, the CLC, which has been a pivotal
gathering since its inception in 1986, [[serves as]{.mark} a
[critical]{.mark} venue [for examining legal and political
issues]{.mark}, through a vast array of theoretical
approaches]{.underline}. That said, the [[Critical Polar
Law]{.underline}]{.mark} initiative has [[emerged to bring these]{.mark}
two [together]{.mark}, [reevaluate]{.mark} the [assumptions commonly
held about]{.mark} the [polar regions and]{.mark} to [address emerging
issues]{.mark} in polar law [through the lens of critical
jurisprudence]{.mark}. It [aims to deconstruct existing legal
realities]{.mark}, [such as]{.mark} the premise of [conceptual
superiority of state sovereignty]{.mark} and its role as the moulder of
law and life in the polar regions. Our way to speculate and prefigure
the future of polar law was to engage on several topics from a more
theoretical perspective with justice at the centre]{.underline}. While
theories of justice have have recently been advanced for Arctic
governance,15) thus far our theoretical endeavours have focused on
broadening this conversation not to focus neither governance nor on the
poles specifically. In an age where planetary politics are being
reassembled, we thought it was worth addressing what lies beyond. We
therefore chose ["theorising" as a means of prefiguration and practice
to assess why]{.underline} [the polar regions can be a site of
theoretical inquiries]{.underline}. Along the way, we articulated
thoughts around alternative theoretical reassessments of polar law.
First, we advance [the term [**Hyperborean Legalities** ]{.mark}to
"[**summon dreamy visions of an alternative legal imaginary**]{.mark}
for the world's northernmost region" and [**to analyse the** **Arctic as
a liminal space**]{.mark}, one **[that exists beyond legal dogmatic
approaches]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Conceptually, Hyperborean
Legalities [[allowed us to challenge]{.mark} the [superiority of state
sovereignty and]{.mark} its role as the moulder of law and life in the
region.]{.underline} The [idea is to challenge both [the way the poles
are]{.mark} often [imagined as empty, frozen, dark lands]{.mark}, and
think alongside the different shapes, forms, and sources of
normativity]{.underline}/ies in the regions.16) Second, and building on
the Hyperborea, we analysed how [the [poles are portrayed as]{.mark}
"[common refuge]{.mark}", [and "areas beyond sovereignty]{.mark}," [yet
also as spaces where state sovereignty]{.mark}/[ies are]{.mark} often
[ontologically reinforced as a tool of exclusion]{.mark}]{.underline}.
In this context, [[in mainstream legal imagination]{.mark}, [they
become]{.mark} "[quasi-frozen sanctuaries]{.mark}]{.underline}" [[where
law freezes yet governance thrives]{.underline}]{.mark}. In these
perceived liminal regions with complex legal, environmental, and social
dynamics, challenging dominant governance structures and traditional
norms. These regions, with their shifting cryospheric
landscapes,17) serve as sanctuaries that bring to light the urgent need
to address climate change and reconsider the relationship between humans
and marine spaces. However, **[[another narrative can be
storied]{.mark}; one [where the fluidity, materiality]{.mark}, [and
disappearance of ice]{.mark}18) [can be]{.mark} thought of as [a]{.mark}
"[sanctuary]{.mark}" [that invites]{.mark} a [rethinking of
environmental protection]{.mark}, [legal frameworks]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} the [struggle against territorial
enclosures]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}in a destabilised planetary
context. [To]{.underline} [come back to prefiguration, [water in a
frozen state can become a source of law]{.mark}. Its disappearance and
the longing for the cold help speculate a normative future that cares
for the human and non-human modes of existence it
supports.1]{.underline}9) This [**[care is not merely]{.mark}** a
**[passive]{.mark}** concern **[but an active relational
engagement]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[recognizing]{.mark} the
[interconnectedness of human and non]{.mark}-[human
entitie]{.mark}s]{.underline}.20) [[Thinking about ice as a source of
law]{.mark} thus [allows us to leave behind landlocked state-bound legal
thinking]{.mark}, [transcend]{.mark} the [constructed ontology
of]{.mark} a [land-sea dichotomy]{.mark}, and think fluidly about
oceanic spaces in all their passing and temporal physical
states.]{.underline} Lastly, it is important to acknowledge that any
political and theoretical engagements with the governance of polar
regions cannot be detached from multiple unfolding planetary crises. The
pitfall of structuring the production of epistemic and normative
knowledge around delimited geographies is that it can lead to tunnel
vision where one becomes unable to see beyond regional impacts. Much
like states, [[polar geographies]{.mark} have been [carefully
constructed along sovereign lines]{.mark}]{.underline}.21) [[To
resist]{.mark} the ever-creeping might of [sovereign powers]{.mark}, [it
is]{.mark} therefore [important to prefigure polar governance as
planetary politics and part of the Earth system.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}As such, polar governance needs to come to terms that nothing
is polar yet everything is. In Cirkovic's words, this [[calls
for]{.mark} a "**[new ontological understanding of the global
politico-juridical space]{.mark}**" [that]{.mark} "[approximate]{.mark}
the [inclusion and representation of]{.mark} '[everything considered to
be non-human]{.mark}"]{.underline}.22) [In [speculating polar legal
imagination]{.mark}, we therefore [argue that]{.mark} the
[Arctic]{.mark} and Antarctic [regions are not merely]{.mark} as
[amalgamates of geographies]{.mark} subjected to climate change and
geopolitical contestations [but]{.mark} as [conceptual spaces
where]{.mark} the [traditional notions of sovereignty, legality, and
normativity are now unfrozen and set adrift in the open sea of
speculative jurisprudence]{.mark}.]{.underline} In this space,
**[[speculation]{.mark} becomes a creative endeavour that [seeks to
articulate]{.mark}, [enact visions of coexistence and justice]{.mark}
that are [attuned to the specificities of the polar
ecologies]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}and histories and [[seek new
paths for legal theory]{.mark} and practice [in]{.mark} a [collective
reimagining of what law can and should be]{.mark} in a broader planetary
context.]{.underline}

#### Centering Indigenous imaginaries is [essential]{.underline} to avoid policy and scholarship that reifies colonized outsider imaginations of the Arctic and excludes Indigenous people from knowledge creation

[In the history of how outsiders imagine the Arctic, we can also make a
connection to what Homi Bhabha calls [the "liminal problem of colonial
identity]{.mark}]{.underline}" that emerges from the "disturbing
distance in-between" the colonialist 'Self' and colonized 'Other'
(Bhabha 1994: 64). [The wilderness/ civilization dichotomy that
[is]{.mark} [at the heart of many imaginaries]{.mark} of the Arctic is
perhaps [similar to]{.mark} the [colonizer/colonized]{.mark},
[or]{.mark} '[Western'/'Other' dichotomy]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
[[comparison]{.mark} of dichotomies [can]{.mark} perhaps
[unearth]{.mark} certain [racist tropes that]{.mark} have [othered
Indigenous Arctic people]{.mark} in political discourse]{.underline} and
visual and literary culture, and [help [to develop an
anti]{.mark}-[colonial lens]{.mark} through which [to better understand
the aesthetics of the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. Such a comparison can
allow us to begin to comprehend the ontological connections between the
ideas of wilderness/civilization (Cronon 1995; Kollin 2001; Oelschlaeger
1991) and colonizer/other (Bhabha 1994; Spivak 2012), uncovering a nexus
centering around notions of objectivity and exteriorization of body and
landscape. This [can encourage aesthetic readings of texts, films,
performances, and political discourse that reveal (neo-)colonial agendas
of exploration and settlement, [ultimately leading to an anti-colonial
agenda of self-realization for Indigenous Arctic people]{.mark}. In
seeking such agendas we can ask how Arctic research stations, oil rigs,
and cruise ships are (re)inscribing colonial legacies onto the sea,
land, and people of the region.]{.underline} If outsiders studying the
Arctic move away from thinking in the wilderness/civilization dichotomy,
from the ontology of the sovereign state, then [[we]{.mark} can begin to
[find new theories and ontologies for thinking about the Arctic in
ways]{.mark} that are [more emancipatory for Indigenous
people]{.mark}.]{.underline} Indeed the burgeoning field of posthuman
studies may hold a major key for how we Think, talk, and act about the
Arctic in an ecologically sustainable and anti-colonial way. The Arctic
in the Anthropocene Non-Indigenous people such as myself, who will
always be profoundly on the outside when studying the Arctic, must
develop new ways of thinking about the region that eschew the dichotomy
of wilderness/civilization, which seems to lead inextricably to the
othering of the peoples and environments of the Arctic[.
[**Vibrant**]{.mark} theories and [**methodologies that center**]{.mark}
the [**experience, knowledge, and imaginations of Indigenous people
are**]{.mark} absolutely [**essential**]{.mark} if we are **[to avoid
scholarship, policy-making]{.mark}**, [**and artistic work that at best
reifies**]{.mark} pre-existing [**outsider imaginaries** **of** **the
region and at worst**]{.mark} totally [**excludes Indigenous voices

### Ontology/AT: State Good

#### Settler colonialism is a network of relations strategically designed to eliminate the Native through physical and political erasure. The federal government created and still perpetuates constraining legal fictions in an attempt to strip Indigenous people of true sovereignty

as the Grass Grows: The Indigenous Fight for Environmental Justice, From
Colonization to Standing Rock*, 2019, pp. 23-26)

THE POLITICAL DIFFERENCE OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES Emphasizing the ways that
a solely distributive notion of environmental justice fails Indigenous
peoples, EJ scholar David Schlosberg notes different conceptions of
justice in the EJ movement, and that **[too often [indigenous
conceptions of justice]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- and indigenous ways of
understanding land and human relations with it -- **[[are obstructed or
not recognized at all]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Even more problematic, as
he points out, [[Indigenous nations]{.underline}]{.mark} in North
America [[experience]{.underline}]{.mark} numerous [[barriers
to]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[participation in]{.mark} the
[governance]{.mark} of environments]{.underline}. Broadening
participation, he contends, would enhance recognition and validate
diverse ways of valuing land. For a conception of environmental justice
to be relevant to a group of people, it must fit within conceptual
boundaries that are meaningful to them. **[[Indigenous
peoples]{.underline}]{.mark}** fighting for political autonomy from the
hegemony of the State **[[are fighting]{.mark} the forces of
[colonialism while simultaneously fighting capitalism -- all aimed at
control of land and resources -- with colonialism as the precondition
for capitalism]{.mark}. [The wealth generated in the
Americas]{.mark}]{.underline}** (much of it transferred to Europe[**)
[could only accumulate from centuries of violent indigenous
displacement, genocide, and land theft]{.mark}. Colonialism is
inextricably bound up with slavery,** having paved the way for the
transatlantic slave trade initiated by Columbus in his first voyage to
the "New World]{.underline}." **[Colonialism and slavery are also
irrefutably linked to the unprecedented amassing of wealth in the United
States]{.underline}**. Karl Marx **[recognized [colonialism]{.mark} as
[the genesis of]{.mark} what he called "primitive [accumulation,"
connecting colonialism, slavery, and capitalism.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
He wrote, "The **[discovery]{.underline}** of gold and silver in
America, the extirpation, **[enslavement and]{.underline}** entombment
in mines of the aboriginal population, the beginning of the
**[conquest]{.underline}** and looting of the East Indies, the turning
of Africa into a warren for the commercial hunting of black-skins,
**[signalized the]{.underline}** rosy **[dawn of]{.underline}** the era
of **[capitalist production]{.underline}**. These idyllic proceedings
are the chief momenta of primitive accumulation. **[In the foundation of
the US, slavery and capitalism are the two cornerstones made possible by
colonial dispossession of Indigenous lands]{.underline}**. **[In
[settler colonialism]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which
**[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** viewed **[[not just]{.underline}]{.mark}**
as **[[a historical event but]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[[a
structure designed to eliminate the Native via physical and political
erasure,]{.underline}]{.mark}** the purpose of political control and
domination is to gain access to territory. The political
**[[erasure]{.mark} of Indigenous peoples [happens in many different
ways, including the refusal of the State to]{.mark}]{.underline}** fully
**[[recognize]{.mark} the]{.underline}** nationhood of **[[Native
collective existence]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[In the US legal
system]{.underline}**, Native nationhood is expressed as federal
recognition and the so-called government to government relationship. In
other words, **[[the State has become the sole determiner of Native
nationhood, despite the longevity of a people]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
a community **[[that have been tied to a place since time
immemorial]{.mark} and their collective ongoing Indigenous identity.
[Native peoples]{.mark} [are]{.mark} thus [in the position of fighting
against the whims of the State not only to protect their lands
but]{.mark} also [for their continued existence as
nations]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Central to Native nationhood is
sovereignty. **[[Federal law]{.underline}]{.mark}** has long recognized
the inherent sovereignty of Native nations based on treaty
relationships, but it is a limited form dictated by legal doctrines as
imagined by the US Supreme Court. The first three cases ever argued in
front of the court involving Indians, referred to as the Marshall
Trilogy, form the basis of today's cannon of federal Indian law. The
court **[[created]{.underline}]{.mark}** what legal scholars have widely
called **[[legal fictions that constructed Native peoples' relationships
with the State]{.mark} that reached beyond the original intent of the
treaties]{.underline}** (the recognition of the independent existence of
tribal nations), [**[reining them in under federal control without their
consent]{.underline}**.]{.mark} In the first case, Johnson v. M'Intosh
(1823), to settle a land dispute between two white men and out of a need
to more clearly define land law in the fledgling country, the court
articulated the so-called doctrine of discovery, the idea that European
religious and cultural superiority gave the US the superior right of
title to land by virtue of discovery, while Native nations merely
possessed the right of occupation, or usufruct rights. In the 1831 case
Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, the court denied the independent existence
of the Cherokee Nation, claiming they were a "domestic dependent
nation," likening the relationship as a ward to its guardian. The
following year [in the Worcester decision, the court asserted the
primacy of the federal government to deal with Native nations, saying
that the state of Georgia had no authority over Indian affairs and
giving birth to the concept of inherent -- but limited --
sovereignty.]{.underline} **[[More than one and a half centuries
of]{.mark} legal decisions and [legislation have chipped away at
Native]{.mark} nations' [control over their own lives and lands,
resulting in a form of sovereignty they never agreed to, with many
nations]{.mark} having been [stripped of]{.mark} their [sovereignty
altogether]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[The legal framework that governs
the tribal-federal nexus forms the core of]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[what is thought of as [a settler colonial structure in a relationship
of domination]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

### AT: Humanism

#### The kritik centers [white]{.underline} leftist visions of the human that [fail]{.underline}; [true]{.underline} relationality emerges from challenging the [foundations]{.underline} of colonial violence and [reimagining]{.underline} humanity from the space of the [shoal]{.underline}.

Native Studies", Duke University Press, soyam)

[Black life]{.underline} [at the space of the shoal becomes]{.underline}
complicated and at times **[unfamiliar]{.underline}**. The old woman of
Caribbean history engaged in the morning ritual of sweeping who walked
on water with sand in her toes caused Kamau Brathwaite to pause and
consider the mysteries of Black diasporic life. Like Brathwaite, I am
forced to pause and consider how [**[Black existence]{.mark}** at the
shoals]{.underline} takes on new shape and meaning. Black life at the
shoals, much like Jacqui Alexander's writing of Yemaya, who inhabits
both land and sea, "[**[pushes past]{.mark}** **modernity**'s [mode of
reason]{.mark}]{.underline}."2 Charmaine Lurch's renderings, depicted on
the cover and in the sculpture "Revisiting Sycorax" (see chapter 5),
bear witness to the ongoing ceremonies, praxes, and reworkings of what
it means to be Black and human, or otherly human existence outside what
Toni Morrison calls the mandate for conquest. I concluded the book with
Lurch's wire sculptures of Sycorax as a counterpoint to the statue of
Christopher Columbus that opens chapter 1. Its defacement by ostensibly
Black or Indigenous actors is a ceremony of its own that attempts to put
a long-lasting conception of the human under pressure. [The ceremony of
**defacing conquistador** Man is]{.underline} also [a space where
**Black and Indigenous** **speech** **touch**]{.underline}. More than
anything, [I have attempted to listen to how Black and Indigenous people
**speak** to one another]{.underline}.

I keep listening for this dialogue as two of the most visible
mobilizations and standoffs with U.S. state violence and
state-sanctioned corporate violence, the **[Movement for Black
Lives]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} the [Standing Rock Sioux's camp
of **Water Protectors**]{.underline}, coincide with the writing of this
book.3 [Both [movements]{.mark} have]{.underline}
[**[reignited]{.mark}** [mobilizations]{.mark}]{.underline} around the
world [[that]{.underline}]{.mark} directly and [explicitly]{.underline}
**[[confront]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[anti]{.underline}]{.mark}**-**[[Black]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[and]{.underline} **[anti]{.underline}**-[**[Indigenous]{.mark}**
**[violence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Both]{.underline} of these
[[movements]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[demand]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
pose these [**[ethical]{.mark}** [questions]{.mark}]{.underline}: "Whose
lives matter?" and "[[**Who** can be considered
**human**]{.underline}]{.mark}?" Further, the **[ethical
[demands]{.mark}]{.underline}** that tether themselves to these
inquiries [[require]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[nation-states
**reflect** on how their]{.underline}]{.mark} very
**[[existence]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[depends on]{.underline}]{.mark}
and is made possible by [[the]{.mark} [**death** of **Black and
Indigenous peoples**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[refusal]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[of]{.mark} **both** [movements]{.mark} [to]{.mark} **[accept]{.mark}**
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates' and
other nation-states' **[[notions of the human]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[has]{.mark} [the capacity to **implode** the very **foundations** of
the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates **[as a
project]{.underline}**. [This]{.underline} [book]{.underline} ultimately
[argues]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [[the most radical]{.mark} of
Black and Indigenous
[projects]{.mark}]{.underline}---[abolition]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [decolonization]{.underline}--- [**[exceed]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} [horizons]{.mark}** [of freedom]{.mark}]{.underline}
currently [[imagined]{.underline}]{.mark} [[by]{.underline}]{.mark}
[a]{.underline} **[[White]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[leftist]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[imaginary]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and discourses of settler colonialism. I have argued that
[White]{.underline} [settler]{.underline} [colonial]{.underline}
[studies]{.underline} as a "leftist" mode of critique
[refuse]{.underline}s [to]{.underline} [**interrogate** the **violent**
orthodoxies]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [continue]{.underline} [to
write the White progressive]{.underline}---worker, queer, trans,
antiracist---subject as the ethical center of the human. [Black
**abolition** and Native]{.underline} **[decolonization]{.underline}**
[are]{.underline} [radical]{.underline} [imaginaries]{.underline} [and
ongoing ceremonial spaces]{.underline} that drag the left offshore and
into the space and horizons of the shoal. In this book, I have attempted
to honor [[Black and Native thought]{.mark}]{.underline} book I have
interrogated normative aesthetic representations of the human (as
conquistador), challenged the necessity of a cartographic self,
questioned the sanctity of labor as the anchor for one's humanity, and
refused notions of sovereignty that cannot account for the porous and
open-ended engagements with another. and politics that
[**[challenge]{.mark}**]{.underline} the essential
**[[assumptions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, practices, and daily
performances [[of what it]{.mark} [means to be
**human**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Black and Native
[struggles]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[call]{.mark} [for the
acknowledgment]{.mark}]{.underline} and honoring [[of]{.mark} [forms of
life]{.mark} [that **exceed the human**]{.mark}]{.underline} as written
by Marxist, anarchist, feminist, and queer social movements cannot
continue to fight for space within the leftist discourse of human (or
posthuman) freedom. [Abolitionist and [decolonial
movement]{.mark}]{.underline} offshore [**[drags]{.mark}** liberal
**[humanist]{.mark}**]{.underline} ([[and
**posthumanist**]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[discourses of]{.mark}
**freedom** **to** **the shoals**]{.underline} [[to contend
with]{.underline} [Black and Native]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[demands]{.underline}]{.mark}** that Man give an account of its
violence. In this book I have interrogated normative aesthetic
representations of the human (as conquistador), challenged the necessity
of a cartographic self, questioned the sanctity of labor as the anchor
for one's humanity, and refused notions of sovereignty that cannot
account for the porous and open-ended engagements with another.

[[As the]{.mark} **reascendency** of violent **[white supremacist
fascist regimes]{.mark}**]{.underline} and their normalization of
relations of conquest [[have **surfaced**]{.mark}]{.underline} (again),
[the]{.underline} political [reawakening that **B**]{.underline}lack
**[L]{.underline}**ives **[M]{.underline}**atter [and Lakota Sioux
struggles for water and life]{.underline} has
[reinvigorated]{.underline} a [discussion about coming
together]{.underline} [or]{.underline} [creating]{.underline} a
[collective]{.underline} [groundswell]{.underline}. [On the **heels** of
**vigorous**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [contentious]{.underline}
[conversations]{.underline} **[initiated by
Afro-pessimists]{.underline}** and activists committed to Black struggle
about how anti-Blackness shapes the coalition politics of the left and
of people of color, I hope more than anything that this book provokes a
conversation about how [[**Black** **and** **Native**
**communities**]{.mark} [can]{.mark}]{.underline} "end this world" and
**[[remake reality]{.underline}]{.mark}** and its relations on more just
terms. It may also be time to create some new grammar and an erotic
politics rooted in the everyday that does not reproduce the problems of
coalitional work for Black and Indigenous people.

Perhaps "coalition" carries too much baggage. Another kind of speech
might be better suited for the kinds of intimacy, connection, conflict,
debate, self-collective reflection, and support---or backup---we desire
from one another. But even if our current terms leave us wanting, [we
cannot stop our pursuit of]{.underline} **[ethical
connection]{.underline}** to one another. I believe that our [yet-to-
come notions of connectedness]{.underline} and [relationality are
capacious enough to yield something more than coalition]{.underline} in
the end. [[A]{.mark} **[new relationality]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[can
imagine new kinds of **Black and Native futures**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
I believe that [the **stakes** of this conversation are so]{.underline}
**[high]{.underline}** because of the capacity for Black abolition and
Native decolonization to remake life in all its expansiveness on new
terms. [Just as Black and Indigenous **life**]{.underline},
**[struggle]{.underline}**, [and **joy** are **forged off the
shoreline**]{.underline} in the space of the shoal, [so must the **new
worlds** we desire]{.underline} and make for one another.

#### Going "[beyond the human]{.underline}" is a [privileged]{.underline}, [white]{.underline} move that ignores how Black and Indigenous people are [still]{.underline} denied full [humanity]{.underline}\-\--[true]{.underline} transcendence must begin with [dismantling genocide]{.underline} and [anti-Blackness]{.underline}.

**[[Poststructuralist]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[traditions]{.underline}]{.mark} [[that]{.underline}]{.mark} [[attempt
to **transcend** identity]{.underline}]{.mark} actually
[[function]{.underline}]{.mark} [[as a **ruse**]{.mark} of]{.underline}
**[subjectlessness]{.underline}**. In fact, [queer]{.underline}
[subjectlessness]{.underline} and non-representational rhizomes are an
[expression]{.underline} [of]{.underline} a

body-as-subject-as-ontology has been more effective in covering the
bloody trail of white/human-self-actualization than it has been at
successfully offering a way around and beyond the entrapments of liberal
humanism. According to Amber Jamilla Musser, even in its
postidentitarian and subjectless modes, [[continental]{.underline}
[theories]{.underline}]{.mark}[\' transgressive moves]{.underline}
([affective]{.underline}, [sensational]{.underline},
[masochistic]{.underline}) [tend to **[reinstantiate]{.mark}**
[the]{.mark} **[white male]{.mark}**]{.underline} (sometimes
**[queer]{.underline}**) [**[subject]{.mark}** that it hopes to
overcome]{.underline}. (44) While not throwing away affect theory in
Sensational Flesh, [Musser]{.underline} [**scrutinizes** [white
queer]{.mark}]{.underline} [[theory]{.mark}\'s moves toward
subjectless]{.underline}, [futurelessnes]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
[masochism]{.underline} as gestures [that]{.underline} actually recover
and **[reify]{.underline}** [a]{.underline} subject (often [**white**
male gay]{.underline}) [as they seek to **annihilate the
subject**.]{.underline}

Because of this, Musser refuses to read sensations like masochism in an
exceptional vein. She explains, \"I seek to reinvigorate these other
ways of reading masochism, particularly because reading it as

masculinity]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} **[suppresses]{.mark}** [other
modes of]{.mark} reading power]{.underline},
[[agency]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and experience]{.underline}.\" (45) As
Musser suspects, [[those who claim]{.mark} a **radical**
**[subjectless]{.mark}**]{.underline} [must [do so]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[through]{.underline}]{.mark} [the]{.underline} [**[abjection]{.mark}**
[of others]{.mark}]{.underline}. Men who claim masochism must become
like (or reify) the position of the feminine -as-debased other without a
self in order to then occupy this position of subjectlessness. A fixing
of an abject position through the (female, Black, Indigenous) body of
the other must occur; then, an evacuation of the other\'s body must take
place in order for the embalming of or supplanting of the body with the
white normative male figure. While Musser does not entirely refuse
Deleuze and Guattari\'s nonrepresentational gesture, she does practice a
kind of detached and suspicious read of the forms of violence that can
be enacted in white moves beyond the human. Musser treats [[queer
theories\']{.underline} [evangelists of]{.underline}]{.mark} [loss and
[futurelessness]{.mark}]{.underline}, Leo
**[[Bersani]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} Lee
**[[Edelman]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [as non-exceptional and]{.underline}
even potentially [[dangerous]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to subjects who
inhabit the abject spaces]{.underline}]{.mark} [that]{.underline} [white
bourgeois men try to occupy]{.underline}. In the 2015 GLQ roundtable
discussion titled \"Queer Inhumanisms,\" Zakiyyah Iman Jackson
reiterated the suspicion that [[posthumanism]{.mark} [is a
**ruse**]{.mark} [for **white human ascendency**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Similar to Musser, Jackson knows that there is often a subject lurking
within the bowels or lines of nonrepresentational discourse. [Jackson
indicts post-humanist calls to move]{.underline} to the
\"[beyond]{.underline}\" [for reproducing a false and
dishonest]{.underline} [European transcendentalism]{.underline}.

Thus [a [call]{.mark} [for movement in the direction
of]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
\"**[[beyond]{.underline}]{.mark}**\" issued in

a manner that suggests that this call is without location, and

therefore with the appearance of incognizance regarding its

situated claims and internal limits, [[**returns** us to a
**Eurocentric**]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[transcendentalism]{.mark} long challenged]{.underline}. (46)

Jackson argues that [a [call]{.mark} for **[movement beyond]{.mark}**
always [happens from]{.mark}]{.underline} [[a]{.underline}]{.mark} very
[**[specific]{.mark}** [place]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The]{.underline}
[posthumanist\'s horn]{.underline} often [blows from a
place]{.underline} [[situated]{.underline}]{.mark} securely
[**[within]{.mark}** [the folds of **humanity**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[This is]{.mark} **a [very different]{.mark} place** [than]{.mark} [the
space of **nonbeing**]{.mark} [from]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[which]{.underline} [Black and]{.underline} **[Indigenous

Because [the]{.underline} [crafting of the human is a
process]{.underline} of relations, specifically the relations [of

also a **relational process**]{.underline}.
[[Transcendence]{.underline}]{.mark} [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
[a]{.underline} relational [process of
**[accountability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[White subjects **cannot**

scholarship of Native/Indigenous and Black feminists force continental
theory to come outside itself and gaze on the way even the various
attempts of non-representational theory to annihilate the self actually
end up reinventing the subject and the human through new forms of
violent invention. This article argues that both [refusal]{.underline}
and skepticism [can]{.underline} work in tandem and [interrupt the
performance of white innocence]{.underline} through less-than-effective
attempts [to evade representation]{.underline} that jettison the garb of
the human [without abolishing the need for Black and]{.underline}

### AT: Veganism 

#### Mandating veganism is indefensible

**Piracha, 2017**

(Yasir, "Decolonizing Veganism," 27 Nov. 2017,
https://www.mcgilldaily.com/2017/11/decolonizing-veganism)

content warning: racism, ableism, eating disorders Being vegan in
Montreal is easy. Lola Rosa is right around the corner. Marché Eden has
you covered for most groceries. The restaurant options are endless and
are never more than a slight detour from your usual route. Your friends
probably don't even make that much fun of you. Besides the occasional
hiccup, veganism is popular and prevalent. Yet over time, I've noticed
that veganism is actually a less feasible choice for many. The ways in
which veganism isolates itself from marginalized individuals need to be
addressed and rectified. When I say being vegan in Montreal is easy, I
need to clarify: it's easy, unless you're lower-middle class, disabled,
living in a marginalized community, or experiencing or recovering from
an eating disorder. I first decided to be vegan earlier this year for
ethical reasons. I thought that fighting against systemic oppression
must at some point include the fight against speciesism. I looked up
vegan recipes, bought vegan groceries, ate vegan food, and eventually
realized it wasn't that hard. By spending time in "plant-based"
restaurants and "health-oriented" grocery stories, I learned a lot about
white vegan culture. I learned about the huge variety of reasons people
choose to be vegan, and how passionate many vegans are about spreading
their beliefs. However, I also learned that **[[veganism is]{.mark}
constantly [used to reproduce oppression. By]{.mark}]{.underline}**
constantly **[[employing]{.mark} guilt tactics and [propagandistic
arguments]{.mark}]{.underline}** to try and convince the public of the
importance of veganism, many **[[vegans homogenize]{.mark} humanity by
ignoring the intersections between different forms of
oppression]{.underline}**. Veganism and settler colonialism
**[[Indigenous populations]{.underline}]{.mark}** often have the most
notable **[[clash]{.underline}]{.mark}**es **[[with animal]{.mark}
rights [activists]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Earlier this month,
[[Indigenous communities gathered for]{.mark} an annual observance of
[the traditional]{.mark} Haudenosaunee [deer hunt]{.mark}]{.underline}
in Short Hills Provincial Park, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}, as they have
in the past, [[animal]{.mark} rights [activists showed up in
protest.]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[Vegans]{.mark} are]{.underline}**
often **[insensitive to Indigenous traditions]{.underline}** and history
in their activism, **[and thus]{.underline}** unknowingly **[[reproduce
set]{.mark}tler [col]{.mark}onialism [by refusing to acknowledge
their]{.mark}]{.underline}** own **[[participation in the oppression of
Indigenous people]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Many Indigenous nations are
irreducible to supposedly normal "human society", they view and treat
animals differently. [Animal rights activists ignore the fact that
[domesticated animals raised]{.mark} solely [for]{.mark}]{.underline}
their [[meat were rare]{.mark} in [pre-colonization]{.mark}]{.underline}
Indigenous [communities, and that the human/animal binary didn't
exist]{.underline} as a concept for Indigenous people. But colonization
twisted these facts, resulting in the perpetuation of misconceptions
regarding Indigenous peoples' treatment of animals. **[Without
recognizing the role settler colonialism plays in the lives of both
Indigenous communities as well as animals, veganism]{.underline}** often
**[fails]{.underline}** to address the role colonization plays in animal
mistreatment. A fight for [[decol]{.mark}onization [is
vital]{.mark}]{.underline} in the struggle [to dismantle]{.underline}
systems of [oppression]{.underline}, and
**[[vegans]{.underline}]{.mark}** must reconcile with that instead of
choosing to **[[target Indigenous communities]{.mark} for their supposed
"cruelty."]{.underline}** Cultural insensitivity [Veganism
has]{.underline} also [isolated itself as a white branch of the animal
liberation movement]{.underline}, by refusing to acknowledge and cater
to people of colour. The perception of the 'classic vegan' being white
isn't groundless. Vegan restaurants are more likely to exist in
upper-class white communities, which already limits exposure and access
for communities of people of colour. This limited access is a direct
consequence of much of the oppression people of colour face, yet
**[[animal]{.mark} rights [activists]{.mark}]{.underline}** often
**[[shame p]{.mark}eople [o]{.mark}f [c]{.mark}olour for not being
vegan.]{.underline}** Ignoring the lived realities of people of colour
often leads to veganism being culturally insensitive. [[Many cultures
use meat as a central ingredient]{.underline}]{.mark} in their dishes.
[White vegans are]{.underline} often [unconcerned with this
fact]{.underline} and try to reduce ethnic reliance on meat, leading to
the appropriation and dilution of ethnic recipes. In a superficial
effort to "increase awareness" of veganism, white vegans will cook vegan
ethnic food to show how it can be done. In my short experience with
ethnic vegan food, white-owned vegan South Asian restaurants have done
more harm than good, as [their insensitivity]{.underline} towards
cultural and historical ties to food [is alienating at
best]{.underline}. "Veganizing" ethnic food must necessarily be the
initiative of people of the ethnicity in question. It is also relevant
to keep in mind that many ancient religious cultures have historically
had large vegetarian populations, such as Jainism, Hinduism, and
Buddhism, to name a few. Ableist arguments It isn't just race and
culture that vegans tend to be insensitive to. In many ways, **[vegan
animal rights [activists engage in ableist]{.mark}]{.underline}**
arguments and **[[practices]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The amount of times
I've heard animal rights activists describe themselves "a voice for the
voiceless" is uncountable, and is a prime example of the conflation of
animality and disability. As Arundhati Roy writes: "There's really no
such thing as the 'voiceless.' There are only the deliberately silenced,
or the preferably unheard." Animals constantly express themselves; they
might cry out with pain or gasp for oxygen. [[Assuming that the
'voiceless' cannot speak "betrays an ableist assumption of what counts
as having a voic]{.underline}e]{.mark}." One of the arguments that
convinced me to be vegan is directly intertwined with disability: the
moral assumption that humans are valued over animals for their
intellectual capabilities and higher-order thinking is ableist. There is
no intellectual capability that all humans have but all animals do not.
Not all humans are capable of higher-order thinking or of speaking a
language. Does this assign them a lower moral value? Upon reflection,
this argument lacks nuance and perpetuates ableism. While [animal
liberation]{.underline} tries to destroy the human/animal binary, it too
often [relies on the instrumentalization of disabled
people]{.underline}. When you compare the situation of animals to
disabled people, you put disabled people's moral value up for
consideration. They have nothing to gain from this argument. By pitting
the intellectually disabled against animals, vegans and animal rights
activists imply that if animals go down, so should intellectually
disabled people. Veganism and food policing Many arguments in favour of
veganism advocate for its health benefits. Facebook videos of people
roaming the streets to aggressively convince people to go vegan have
gone viral recently, and are often quite troubling. Policing food can be
triggering for many people, including those recovering from eating
disorders. Watching people convince others of the "health benefits" of
veganism and having someone tell you what you can and cannot eat is not
something everyone is or should be ready for. Again, vegans and animal
liberation activists must acknowledge this and be aware that some people
need to take care of themselves first. Food shaming and policing is
unnecessary and unhelpful. The price of veganism Vegan restaurants are
often advertised as "healthy," "raw," and "organic." The environment
they create is one of "clean eating" and self-care. However, it's easy
to be turned off almost immediately by prices. [[Vegan restaurants often
double]{.mark} the [price]{.mark} of a meal]{.underline} by using
locally-grown produce and organic ingredients. A simple take-out meal
can be financially taxing, especially for students on a budget. This is
particularly true for people of lower socioeconomic status, as it often
not feasible for some to spend extra on plant-based products when animal
products and byproducts are often cheaper and more widely accessible.
Yet many [privileged [vegans continue to assume that fighting against
speciesism "transcends" this barrier, ignoring]{.mark} the reality of
[classism]{.mark} and economic oppression]{.underline}. It is not
uncommon for vegans to decline to acknowledge that class differences are
an obstacle in becoming vegan, which ends up reproducing classism in
many ways. [Not everyone has a position privileged enough to be
vegan]{.underline}. Government programs often strategically place
Intensive Livestock Operations --- otherwise known as factory farms ---
near Black or Indigenous communities, making animal products readily
available in these areas, and often forcing people of colour to work
jobs in these facilities. Even crop farms tend to have a large number of
marginalized and migrant workers, and are often subjected to low-wages
and abuse. It is essential to recognize that not all plant-based
products are "cruelty-free" when you consider the treatment of food/farm
workers. "Food deserts," areas with decreased access to fresh fruits and
vegetables, are also characteristically in areas with low-income and
minority residents, making veganism much less viable for marginalized
individuals. To be an effective movement, [animal liberation activists
need to recognize how capitalism and white supremacy operate to oppress
people of colour]{.underline}. Marginalized individuals are often not
able to even consider being vegan, due to the structural oppression they
face every day. Ignoring these systems of oppression will not further
the animal liberation cause, only hinder it. Consulting movements such
as anti-racism and anti-ableism can provide a deeper understanding of
concepts such as violence and objectification, and ensures that one
movement doesn't negate or impede another. For people dealing with
systemic oppression and discrimination, veganism can often be the last
thing on people's minds. Instead of the "go vegan or go home" approach,
animal liberation activists must acknowledge and participate in the
fight against oppressive structures such as capitalism, white supremacy,
and settler colonialism.

San Marcos. She is a Colville Confederated Tribes descendant. *As Long
as the Grass Grows: The Indigenous Fight for Environmental Justice, From
Colonization to Standing Rock*, 2019, pp. 99-108)

WHITE SUPREMACY AND THE SEEDS OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT Few terms in
American vernacular English can elicit the kind of emotionally charged
response that "white supremacy" can. [[Americans like to think]{.mark}
that]{.underline} since the civil rights era, [[we have]{.mark}
[achieved]{.mark} the postracial]{.underline}, meritocratic,
[multicultural state where [color blindness]{.mark} and equal
opportunity prevails]{.underline}. Both liberals and conservatives like
to think that racism is defined only by hostile behavior from which
individuals can excuse themselves because they have friends, employees,
perhaps an old lover or two who are people of color. In this way of
thinking, white supremacy is an ideology restricted only to rogue
alt-right neo-Nazis or white-nationalist fringe groups, and certainly
not well-meaning everyday people, whether conservative or liberal. While
**[white supremacy]{.underline}** is most definitely at the root of
those regressive social movements, as a foundational worldview
constructed by centuries of white European settlement of the United
States, it is far broader than that. It [**is the thread from which the
American social fabric is woven.** A few decades of [laws]{.mark}
promoting racial justice [have failed to unravel]{.mark} the systemic
forms that [white supremacy]{.mark} has taken]{.underline}, reflected by
a range of social indicators from chronic wealth inequality to negative
educational outcomes to disproportionate rates of violence (police,
sexual, and domestic) and incarceration in communities of color.
[Centuries of dehumanization of American Indians, African Americans, and
ethnic minority "others" has left its mark on the American mind and in
its institutions, refusing to die]{.underline}. In Indian country, white
supremacy was never limited to just racial inferiority, since ideologies
of religious and cultural inadequacy predated it, as the previous
discussion on the foundations of federal Indian law, particularly [the
doctrine of Christian discovery]{.underline}, revealed. [That Native
people were inferior to white Europeans was a given]{.underline} and
widely accepted by the general public well before and after the
nineteenth century. It was as true for John Muir as it was for his
predecessor Henry Thoreau. Some writers claim that Muir\'s racist views
on Indians stemmed from his postimmigration childhood in Wisconsin\'s
Winnebago territory and became intensified after coming to California.
When Muir arrived in San Francisco in 1868, California was engaged in an
open campaign of extermination of California Indians, which he didn\'t
seem to ever have actively opposed[. Instrumental in the creation of
Yosemite National Park, he supported the expulsion of the Yosemite
Indians from their ancient home]{.underline} in the valley and journaled
his experiences with and thoughts about California \"digger\" Indians (a
derogatory term even then), whom he found dirty, lazy, ugly, and
altogether disappointing. Muir\'s apologis like to point out that his
views about Indians evolved over time, especially after his travels to
Alaska where he spent time among Tlingits and other Alaska and Pacific
Northwest Natives, gradually growing more favorable ideas about
Indigenous peoples. It\'s true that his opinions improved over time, but
Muir never fully shed his views of Indigenous inferiority that were
shaped by his religious upbringing. In Alaska Natives he may have been
more able to see a noble culture that lived in harmony with its
environment, but even in this case he never transcended **[[a deeply
ingrained]{.mark} pattern of Christian
[paternalism]{.mark}]{.underline}** that **[[presupposed Natives as
culturally deficient and in need of]{.mark} Christian
[improvement]{.mark}]{.underline}**.\' At a time of profound oppression
of Native people, Muir\'s \"evolution\" can be said to have risen to no
more than old-fashioned European American benevolent supremacy. **[[The
idea of wilderness]{.underline}]{.mark}** as conceived by
preservationists and conservationists **[[was a white-settler social
construct. It imagined an unpeopled, wild landscape as]{.mark}
pristine[, pure, and unspoiled]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,
**[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} as the environmental historian Carolyn
Merchant asserts, **[reflected values that [equated wilderness with
whiteness]{.mark} and]{.underline}**, after postbellum black urban
migration, **[cities with darkness and depravity. [These tropes, rooted
in policies of removal and segregation]{.mark}]{.underline}**, she
argues, **[[led to the ideal of an American \"colonized
Eden]{.underline}]{.mark}**,\" a \"controlled, managed garden\" **[[from
which colonized Indigenous peoples,]{.mark} immigrants, and people of
[color were systematically excluded and which led to]{.mark} patterns of
[toxic]{.mark} waste [dumping in communities of
color]{.mark}]{.underline}**.? It is against this backdrop that the
Sierra Club, the United States first nongovernmental, environmentally
focused organization, was founded in 1892, with John Muir at the helm as
one of its founding members and first elected president. Established
initially as a mountaineering enthusiast club, its mission was \"to
explore, enjoy, and render accessible the mountain regions of the
Pacific Coast; to publish authentic information concerning them,\' and
\"to enlist the support and cooperation of the people and government in
preserving the forests and other natural features of the Sierra
Nevada.3323 From its inception the Sierra Club\'s agenda was to protect
Northern California\'s wilderness areas, which by then had been largely
cleared of California\'s Indigenous population, with the survivors of
the state\'s genocidal policies confined to small rancherias and
reservations. It also dovetailed with the federal policy of forced
assimilation legislated by the 1887 Dawes Act in the immediate
post-Indian-war period. Nationwide, with the Indian population at record
low numbers, safely contained within reservation boundaries and guarded
by strictly enforced laws against hunting outside those bounds, the
stage was set for a burgeoning new phase aimed at protecting what
remained of the United States\' «wild\" places and animals. On the heels
of the industrial revolution and western expansion, and with a
still-growing national infrastructure, protecting the
environment\--framed as preservation and conservation- would be a matter
of balancing the needs of development with wise use of land and natural
resources. The first few decades of the twentieth century saw the
establishment of numerous nongovernmental organizations and governmental
agencies and laws oriented toward preservation and conservation. Among
them are the National Audubon Society (1905), Antiquities Act (1906),
National Park Service (1916), National Parks Conservation Association
(1919), Izaak Walton League (1922), Wilderness Society (1922), Civilian
Conservation Corps (1933), National Wildlife Federation (1936),
Defenders of Wildlife (1947), and Nature Conservancy (1951). While
naturalists worked to protect lands acquired through centuries of
aggressively imposed treaties and a variety of other legally sanctioned
land grabs, tribes struggled to hold on to what remained of their land
bases and cultures. By 1934, with the passage of the Wheeler Howard Act,
a new policy direction was ushered in, influenced by a new generation of
Western-educated Indians. Also called the Indian Reorganization Act, or
the \"Indian New Deal,\" the law allowed tribes to organize their own
tribal governments patterned after the US Constitution. It reversed the
assimilation policy and empowered newly reconstituted tribal governments
to have greater management of their own land and mineral rights (still,
however, under the close supervision of the Bureau of Indian Affairs),
building capacity for economic development as the answer to the
intractable poverty that choked tribal communities. By 1949, under the
Truman administration, assimilation was back on the table, and in 1953
Congress passed House Concurrent Resolution 108, also known as the
termination bill. Conceived as a final solution to the \"Indian
problem,\" termination was framed as the liberation of tribes from the
yoke of federal supervision. In reality, it was no less than another
push for the federal government to abrogate its treaty obligations and
end its administrative responsibilities to Indians, and another land
grab. Under termination, tribal governments were dissolved, their lands
transferred into white settler ownership, and more than twelve thousand
individual Indians absorbed into the American mainstream, no longer
legally recognized as Indians. The termination policy\'s relocation
program transferred thousands of Indians from their reservation homes to
large cities, causing a population shift away from the reservations.
More than one hundred tribes were terminated throughout the 1950s and
\'60s -at least forty-six in California alone- with particularly
disastrous effects on the Menominee in Wisconsin and Klamath in southern
Oregon. But the winds of change were blowing in the US with a growing
civil rights movement and once again Indians were organizing, this time
on college campuses and in urban areas like Minneapolis, San Francisco,
Los Angeles, Seattle, and beyond. The new Red Power movement activated
Indian people on and off reservations who argued for resistance to
termination and for honoring the treaty relationship. A policy shift to
self-determination solidified a government to government relationship,
which by the 1980s would come to be articulated in the legal language of
tribal sovereignty. New laws enabled tribal governments to pursue
economic development projects, from resource development to gaming, by
reacquiring federal recognition and traditional homelands and
revitalizing cultural practices\--sending them at times on a collision
course with the new environmental movement. THE MODERN ENVIRONMENTAL
MOVEMENT AND CLASHES WITH INDIAN COUNTRY The Red Power movement was just
one aspect of the social revolution that swept across the American
social landscape in the 1960s and \'70s, paralleling other ethnic
nationalisms, women\'s liberation, the antiwar movement, and the
emergence of a new, rebellious, and predominantly white middle-class
counterculture. Disenchanted with the conservative values of their
parents\' generation and witnessing the increasing degradation of the
environment, countercultural youth looked to other cultures for answers
to existential questions they perceived as unavailable in mainstream
American society. [In American Indians they]{.underline}, like Thoreau
and Muir before them, [saw a relationship to nature that should be
emulated, inspiring a back-to-the-land movement and an aesthetic that
unequivocally evoked the Indian-long hair, headbands,
moccasins]{.underline}, beads and feathers, leather and fringe,
turquoise and silver. In 1971, just a few months after the first Earth
Day signaled the beginning of a modern environmental movement,
**[Indians unwittingly became the symbol of the]{.underline}** new
**[movement]{.underline}** **[with the famous \"Crying
Indian]{.underline}**\" antilittering commercial released by Keep
America Beautiful, Inc. The image of a buckskin-clad Indian, with a
single tear rolling down his face as a factory spews toxic smoke in the
background and trash thrown from a car lands on his beaded moccasins,
[seared]{.underline} itself [into America\'s collective consciousness.
Never mind that the Indian, Iron Eyes Cody, was no Indian at all, but
a]{.underline} 100 percent [Sicilian American actor]{.underline} named
Espera Oscar de Corti [who had built an entire career\--and personal
life- on Indian impersonation]{.underline}. **[The Crying Indian
represented]{.underline}** what anthropologist Shepard Krech IlI called
**[the \"ecological Indian,\" a revamped version of the noble savage who
became the stand-in for an environmental ethic the US should aspire
to]{.underline}**.?4 In a strangely visceral way, the deception of Iron
Eyes Cody mirrored the falseness of the ecological Indian stereotype,
because like de Corti\'s fake, hyper-Indian image,?
**[the]{.underline}** new **[stereotype set an impossibly high standard
to which white environmentalists would hold Native people for the next
several decades]{.underline}**. It came at a time when tribal
governments had finally regained enough power to exercise
self-determination in nation-building projects that often involved
exploiting the only things they had -natural resources- setting the
stage for future conflict and discord. The relationship between the
counterculture and Indian country was complicated from the beginning.
Desiring a deeper connection with the Earth and a more meaningful form
of spirituality, [hippies made pilgrimages to reservations]{.underline}
searching for the mystical Indian wisdom they had read about in books
like John Neihardt\'s Black Elk Speaks and Carlos Castaneda\'s wildly
successful but fraudulent series about the Yaqui shaman Don Juan
Matus.?6 Other ethnic frauds infested the literary counterculture over
the next few decades, exploiting the gullibility of the spiritually
starved and building a lucrative New Age industry in the process.? The
problem was not so much that hippies looked to Indian country for
answers. It was that [as settlers they]{.underline} unconsciously
[brought]{.underline} with them [worldviews and behavior patterns that
were inconsistent with Indigenous paradigms and tried to fit Indigenous
worldviews and practices into their own]{.underline} cognitive
[frameworks]{.underline}. [Predominant among their settler culture
frameworks are the pursuit of universal truth]{.underline} and personal
edification, both particularly Christian ideas [in the context of the
US]{.underline}. If truth is universal, the logic goes, then the truths
perceived in Native cultures must be applicable to all people
everywhere, and in the United States everyone has the right to practice
whatever religion they choose. Non-Natives couldn\'t comprehend that
Native spiritual principles evolved over eons based on ancient
relationships to place and was reflected in language and specific
histories, and that the function of Indigenous ceremonies was primarily
for the perpetuation of particular communities, not personal
enlightenment. An orientation based on rugged individualism combined
with **[a deeply ingrained sense of entitlement]{.underline}** (Manifest
Destiny in its modern form) **[translated into]{.underline}** the
**[toxic mimicry]{.underline}** that today we call cultural
appropriation, which takes a multitude of forms. At its core, cultural
appropriation is always an invocation of \"authentic\" Indians and
Indian culture as constructed by settlers, however falsely. The
fetishized authentic Indian is the representational production of the
culturally and biologically \"pure\" Indian, and the ecological Indian
trope was just the counterculture and environmental movement\'s version
of it. The Indian-inspired back-to-the-land sensibility cultivated by
the counterculture emerged as another iteration of the environmental
movement, but it was expressed in distinctly spiritual terms drawn from
Native peoples, as the literary examples of Carlos Castaneda and many
others demonstrate, however problematically. Sometimes referred to as
\"second-wave environmentalism.\" countercultural hippies, despite their
blatant appropriations, did at times work constructively with Indian
country. As historian Sherry L. Smith documents, the Pacific Northwest
Fish Wars, the cultural revolution in California, the Wounded Knee
occupation, and other places and events saw productive partnerships
between hippies and Native people who were working for Indian rights
alongside calls for other social justice reforms. Indians sometimes even
exploited non-Natives\' misplaced beliefs about Native cultural
authenticity, but overall \"most **[[leftists did not understand that
their adulation]{.mark} and reverence [carried]{.mark}]{.underline}**
this darker undercurrent \[of **[[colonialism]{.mark} [and
racism]{.mark}]{.underline}**[\]]{.mark}.\*28 Historian Paul Rosier
contends that the mainstream environmental movement developed in tandem
with an American Indian environmentalism during the 1960s and \'70s,
sometimes intersecting in interesting ways (the Fish Wars is a good
example, and literary examples include Ken Kesey\'s blockbuster One Flew
Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest and Edward Abbey\'s 1975 cult classic The Monkey
Wrench Gang). \"An important element of this story," Rosier writes, "is
thus the conversation and collaboration among Indians and non-Indians on
environmental problems in their efforts to find common ground; the
process was an exchange of ideas and political support rather than a
one-way act of appropriation or cultural imperialism.\"29 But **[as the
years progressed]{.underline}**, the **[cultural appropriation and
imperialism intensified with the]{.underline}** rise of the New Age
**[movement, and]{.underline}** the **[conversations and collaborations
weren\'t]{.underline}** **[always]{.underline}** smooth, or even
**[present at all]{.underline}**, when they should have been. With the
1975 shift in federal policy to tribal self-determination and as tribal
governments sought economic development, land use projects, land return,
and cultural revitalization, [clashes between tribes and white
environmental groups were on the rise]{.underline} by the early 1980s,
**[exposing the groups\' historic roots in (white) settler privilege and
racism]{.underline}**. In 1983, for instance, the Nature Conservancy
purchased four hundred acres of land on the White Earth Reservation and
donated it back to the state of Minnesota, not the tribe. \' In 1985 the
Sierra Club sued to prevent Tlingit and Haida in Alaska from logging on
Admiralty Island, after the US had returned twenty-three thousand acres
as part of a land claims settlement. In 1992 the Sierra Club refused to
support the White Earth Land Recovery Project\'s effort to have returned
the northern half of the Tamarac Wildlife Refuge to the White Earth Band
on the grounds that the club would not have a say in refuge
management.\" [In 1999, after years of legal, cultural, and spiritual
groundwork, the Makah tribe]{.underline} in Washington State
[successfully hunted and killed their first gray whale in more than
seventy years from a traditional cedar canoe. The reprisals were swift
and furious]{.underline}, coming from a variety of antiwhaling and
animal rights groups, the most vocal from the Sea Shepherd Conservation
Society\'s Paul Watson, a founding member of Greenpeace.?2 [The Makah
received death threats, hate mail, public harassment, and the inevitable
challenges to the authenticity of the tribe\'s culture]{.underline}.
[Conservationist mythologies of Native people living in untouched
pristine nature have dogged them even into recent years.]{.underline}
The Timbisha Shoshone in California\'s Death Valley were dispossessed of
their lands with the creation of Death Valley National Monument in 1933,
ending the tribe\'s ancient land management when their homeland came
under the management of the National Park Service. In 1983 the tribe
gained federal recognition, but because federal recognition did not come
with the return of land, it would take many more years of legal battles
to finally reacquire 7,754 acres within the park, under the Timbisha
Homeland Act. Decades of landscape neglect resulted in the deterioration
of the honey mesquite and single-leaf piñon groves\--both important food
sources\--and in 2000 the Timbisha requested comanagement with the Park
Service to resume their traditional management practices, but they faced
bitter opposition from numerous environmental groups and individuals,
including the local Sierra Club chapter. In the public commenting
process of a legislative environmental impact assessment, a dominant
theme running through the comments was objection to tribal management.
Public opposition was based on the tired, old belief of a pristine
wilderness, as though the valley had been uninhabited and unmanaged for
millennia. Eventually the conflict was resolved, and today the Timbisha
Shoshone are engaged with the Park Service in experimental projects to
rehabilitate the natural habitat with traditional techniques.33
Opposition to gaming has also been a platform upon which
environmentalists have battled with tribes. I began my career as a
journalist with one particularly ugly episode in 2003 in the Northern
California community of Sonoma County. I chronicled an explosive
controversy over plans of the Federated Indians of the Graton Rancheria
(FIGR) to build a casino and hotel resort within its traditional
territory of Rohnert Park, a town that was part of the county\'s growing
urban sprawl and where I happened to live. Sonoma County and neighboring
Napa Valley are better known as California\'s wine country, and tribal
gaming had long been perceived as a corrupting influence in an otherwise
politically liberal and expanding economic climate. Prior tribal gaming
ventures had faced bitter opposition and vitriolic fights. Initial
promises not to pursue a gaming operation were made by tribal leaders
under pressure from congressional members as a condition of the tribe\'s
federal recognition bill, which had passed only three years earlier. But
when the recognition bill passed without an antigaming clause, the
tribal council changed its mind; well-funded gaming industry backers had
courted them based on what was sure to be a lucrative location.
Terminated in the 1950s and with widespread poverty in its community,
the tribe had regained its recognition but had no land base. The project
would first require the acquisition of land that would then be taken
into federal trust, making it a reservation. Once the site was chosen
and the purchase initiated, the organized casino opposition kicked into
high gear, becoming a spectacle of modern bipartisan anti-Indianism and
invoking the ghosts of California\'s not-so-distant genocidal past. Like
the Makah, the tribe faced death threats and public hate speech,
inaccurate and unfair media representation, and vicious racist attacks.
And it went on for years. Lawsuits failed to stop the project. The
conflict raised issues of the tribe\'s sovereignty, its right to
economic development, and the historical injustices it had faced on one
hand, and on the other, an ideologically driven disapproval of gaming by
a surprisingly large and diverse segment of the local population. The
result was a toxic brew of highly public and far-reaching anti-Indian
rhetoric. After a 360-acre parcel of farmland had been purchased and the
land taken into trust in 2010, the opposition group Stop the Casino 101
Coalition tried numerous tactics to block construction, including
appeals to environmental harm. The Center for Biological Diversity was
brought in and determined that the habitat of the endangered tiger
salamander would be affected. Adding fuel to an already raging political
conflagration, public debates then centered on the need to balance
economic development (not tribal sovereignty) with environmental
protection. Efforts to stop the project based on the endangered
salamander ultimately failed, however, and the casino opened in 2013.
The highly divisive public battle led all the way to the US Supreme
Court, with the court declining to hear the case in 2015. In the end,
challenges based on salamander habitat resulted in the US Fish and
Wildlife Service\'s designation of a 47,383-acre salamander protection
zone, an exemption of 252 acres of FIG\'s property from the zone,\' and
the tribe setting aside 180 acres and \$24 million for environmental
mitigation projects. Legal strategies aimed at protecting the salamander
may have failed to stop the project, but it raised [troubling and
provocative questions about what it means for non-Indians to use
environmental issues as a political wedge against tribes\' right to
exercise sovereignty,]{.underline} especially if seen through a lens
that recognizes settler colonialism as an ongoing process of
environmental injustice. If settler colonialism is a structure that
disrupts Indigenous peoples\' relationships to their environments (as
clearly happened to FIGR) and the exercise of sovereignty is at least a
partial effort to reverse that structure, then opposition to it would be
read as favoring a system that continues to commit environmental
injustice against Indigenous peoples. It also highlights why
**[environmental injustice]{.underline}** is an issue that **[for
Indigenous peoples goes beyond environmental racism.]{.underline}** To
what degree is **[environmentalism deployed as]{.underline}** just
**[another weapon of colonial domination]{.underline}** in unpopular
tribal economic development projects? Connecting the issue more broadly
to ethical land use in energy projects, how can environmental awareness
and protection be balanced with histories of injustice and respect for
tribal sovereignty? If environmentalists (and the broader public) were
more knowledgeable about tribal histories, sovereignty, and colonialism,
could they transcend narratives that reduce debates about tribal
economic development projects to environment versus development or in
the case of gaming, communities versus tribal gaming? Finally, how can
education about settler privilege, white supremacy, and systemic racism
improve relations between Indian and non-Indian activist communities and
the broader American population overall?

There are two different ways to look at a word. One is to analyze the
word in the same way we examine an object; the other is to [engage in a
**[conversation with the word]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The first
approach is reifying because the word is turned into a word-thing and
its understanding is **separated from the power** of the word
[to]{.mark} [confer **meaning**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The second is a
[**[dialogic penetration]{.mark}** [into]{.mark} the word]{.underline} -
a [**conversation** that opens up **fresh aspects** of [the
word]{.mark}]{.underline} (Bakhtin 1981). In this paper, I engage in a
conversation with one of the most powerful words in the world today:
**[[development]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [The power of the word
[stems]{.mark} [from]{.mark} its capacity to **designate** when and
under what conditions a country is considered to be
**developed**]{.underline}. Economic indicators,
[**[industrialization]{.mark}** [and **Western
values**]{.mark}]{.underline} have [taken precedence [over]{.mark}
**[quality of life]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the environment or
non-Western views [[as a measure of]{.mark} **progress**]{.underline}.
The [**[enchantment]{.mark}** with development]{.underline} would be
difficult to understand [[without the]{.mark} [promise]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} [a]{.mark} **[better future]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} an
**ideal of [progress]{.mark}**]{.underline}. If pronounced by
international institutions like the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) or the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP), the power of the word development increases to the point
that scattered dreams become regulatory transactions, programs of
action, and statutory conditions, often [dictated by those claiming to
own it]{.underline}. In developing countries, development plans, made
official in the 1950s, have since mediated a precarious contractual
relationship between elected officials and their citizens. Development
is not only a weapon of the strong but also of the weak. As Frederick
Cooper documents in the African context, [development,
[conceived]{.mark} [to]{.mark} **[reinvigorate
colonialism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, was central to elites\' giving up
colonies since it could be administered by Africans as well as Europeans
(Cooper 1997). Latin American elites struggled to handle issues of
development and industrialization outside the influence of the United
States and the Soviet Union. In 1848, they asked the United Nations to
create the Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA), which became a
key player in [articulating alternative views of
development]{.underline} (Sikkink 1991). Moreover, the notion of
development put forward by ECLA transformed the diagnostic of the
[causes of **underdevelopment** [from racialistic explanations
into]{.mark} a [state-led]{.mark} [social]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
**[economic]{.mark} agenda**]{.underline} (Ortiz 2000). Women
articulated their [[struggles]{.mark} [for]{.mark} **[equality]{.mark}**
around the word development]{.underline}. Scholars like Esther Boserup
(1970) pioneered the recognition of women in development strategies.
This recognition was initially denominated by Women in Development
(WID). The aim was to integrate women into male power structures
(Parpart 1995). Criticisms of this approach led to the Women and
Development approach, which called for women-only projects designed to
avoid male domination. A shift to a Gender and Development (GAD)
perspective placed the focus on transforming gender roles and the power
of sustaining gender hierarchies. Women\'s claims were institutionalized
in bilateral assistance programs worldwide and institutionalized in
practices like the United Nation\'s Decade on Women and the program of
action agreed to in Beijing in 1995. By conversing with the word
development, I expect to reveal the secrets of its power and to
contribute to an understanding of why development has captured the
desires of both the powerful and the weak for more than a century.
Engaging in a dialogue with this word is a difficult endeavour, partly
because its meaning has changed historically and partly because the
speaking subjects use the word to convey different meanings. Before
addressing the question of what\'s in the word development, I will trace
its genealogy.

In the 1920s, just as the Mediterranean [**[metaphor]{.mark}** was being
**[deployed]{.mark}** in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico [to
justify]{.mark} U.S. [commercial]{.mark} ([and]{.mark} [**military**)
**expansion**]{.mark}, a similar trope was being applied [in]{.mark} the
**[Arctic]{.mark}**.]{.underline} A key proponent of this effort was
the Canadian-American anthropologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson. In such
books as The Friendly Arctic (1921) and The Northward Course of Empire
(1922a), Stefansson argued that the Arctic, far from being a frozen
wasteland, was a 'Polar Mediterranean.\' Like the Mediterranean, [he
wrote,]{.underline} [the Arctic featured a relatively navigable central
space that united diverse coastal peoples in commerce and **[productive
interaction]{.mark}**.]{.underline} With the advent of new
transportation technologies (especially the airplane) that would further
ease navigation across its inner sea. the Arctic was likely to emerge as
a new centre of civilization. As Stefansson wrote in National Geographic
Magazine: A map giving one view of the northern half of the northern
world shows that the so-called Arctic Ocean is really a Mediterranean
sea like those which separate Europe from Afnca or North America from
South Amenca. Because of its smallness, we would do well to go back to
an Elizabethan custom and call it not the Arctic Ocean but the Polar Sea
or Polar Mediterranean. The map shows that most of the land in the world
is in the Northern Hemisphere, that the Polar Sea is like a hub from
which the continents radiate like the spokes of a wheel. The white patch
shows that the part of the Polar Sea never yet navigated by ships is
small when compared to the surrounding land masses. (Stefansson 1922b.
205) Although the Mediterranean analogy has faded from public
imagination in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico, it has recently
undergone a resurgence in the Arctic. [Regional boosters are seeking new
[tropes]{.mark}
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} [[assist]{.underline}]{.mark} [them in
realizing]{.underline} the [[opportunities]{.underline}]{.mark} that
they believe will come [from **climate change** and the demise of Cold
War tensions,]{.underline} and they have seized upon the Mediterranean
as an appropriate, if climatically incongruous, analogue. The prevalence
of mediterraneanist discourse in the Arctic became apparent to my
research team in 2010 when we were in Alaska conducting interviews on
Arctic geopolitics. Driving to an interv iew on our first day in
Anchorage we turned on Alaska Public Radio and heard a promotional
advertisement announcing that the topic for that week's Talk of Alaska
radio show was to be: Ts the Arctic the new Mediterranean?\' As it
turned out, the programme featured an interview with author Charles
Emmerson (who had recently published The Fut we History\* of the Arctic
\[2010\]). The programme began with the host, Steve Heimel, giving the
following introduction: The climate is wanning \... and what this does
is it opens up the Arctic Ocean. The question is: What now? Does the
Arctic at some point become the Mediterranean? Does the Arctic Ocean
become the centre of civilization, with a warming climate, and how many
years from now- does what happen? Everybody's looking at this. Anybody
in the policy area, whether it's science, whether it's mineral
exploration, whether it's international law. The implications of an
opening Arctic are staggering and different from the kinds of dreams
that the polar explorers once had. but not all that different. Emmerson,
in turn, followed up by discussing the predictions of one of those
'polar explorers': Vilhjalmur Stefansson \... wrote this wonderful book
called The Northward Course of Empire, and his idea was that thousands
of years ago the centres of civilization had all been in very hot
places, very temperate places - Cairo, Baghdad, then in Rome and later
slightly cooler places such as London and Paris and then New- York - his
vision was that that line is going to continue and the centre of
civilization 20 or 30 years from now is going to be Winnipeg or
Anchorage, (transcribed from Alaska Public Radio Network 2010)
Apparently, the image of an Arctic Mediterranean resonated with
Alaskans, because it was brought up, without our prompting, in two
subsequent interviews. First, an official from Alaska's Department of
Natural Resources specifically referenced the radio programme: Last
Tuesday there was a public radio programme produced here by the Alaska
Public Radio Network called Talk of Alaska and last week was 'Is the
Arctic the New Mediterranean?'\... I didn't make it -1 can't listen to
it during the day - but I thought that the tag was sort of funny. I'd
never thought of the Arctic as a new Mediterranean, but there's probably
no \[fewer\] people living around the Arctic \[now-\] than lived around
the Mediterranean in Roman times. In another interview, an elected
official, when informed that we were a team of geographers funded by the
U.S. National Science Foundation, remarked: The first geography teacher
I ever had suggested that civilizations come about because of
interaction and accessibility, and, you know; that's why classic
geography says, 'Look at rivers, ports, how- does that all happen?' \...
\[With climate change,\] Pd be fascinated to kind of take the classical
geographic thinking and say, 'Okav, what will be the ties that will
endure, that will ultimately change this?'And I don't know what they
are, there's a lot of potential right now and there are some things that
\[will\] w-ork and things that won't work, but now; you take a look at
the vision of the Arctic, where the unified Arctic is kind of a
Mediterranean play and so forth \.... And that is the question that I'd
ask if I had a National Science Foundation grant to look at cooperation
in the Arctic. Because in the end, all the meetings we do, they're fun
meetings, but what endures is what people are going to do with Arctic
regular commerce. In making this statement, the elected official was
unknowingly (or, perhaps, knowingly) referencing a mediterraneanist,
liberal view of the ocean held since Aristotle, who encouraged
civilizations and cities to adopt a maritime orientation in the belief
that cultural and commercial movement across the maritime surface of
exchange would lead to peace and prosperity (Gottman 1973). Although not
directly referencing the Mediterranean, then Soviet Premier Mikhail
Gorbachev similarly drew on the mediterraneanist concept of the
cosmopolitan emporion when he noted, in 1987, 'The Arctic is not only
the cosmopolitan emporion when he noted, in 1987, 'The Arctic is not
only the Arctic Ocean but also \... the place where the Eurasian, North
American, and Asia pacific regions meet, where the frontiers come close
to one another and the interests of states \... cross\' (Gorbachev
1987). Likewise, then U.S. vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin
famously proclaimed. 'We have that very narrow maritime border between
the United States \... and Russia \.... They're very, very important to
us and they are our next door neighbor \.... You can actually see Russia
from land here in Alaska, from an island in Alaska \.... I\'m giving you
that perspective of how small our world is and how important it is that
we work with our allies, to keep good relation\[s\] with all of these
countries, especially Russia' (ABC News 2009). As in the actual
Mediterranean, however, the mediterraneanist [ideal of
**[unity]{.mark}** [amidst]{.mark} **[exchange]{.mark}** [in the
Arctic]{.mark} is [paired]{.mark} [with]{.mark} one of **[antagonistic
difference]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Resurrecting the dream of Vilhjalmur
Stefansson, military affairs journalist Barry Zellen (2008) wrote in
Toronto\'s Globe and Mail that the only factor that had so far prevented
the Arctic from emerging as a site of interaction and investment was its
climate. Now, with climate change, he argued, the potential for the
Arctic to emerge as a 'new Mediterranean\' will likely be realized.
However, Zellen went on to write [that the **\'Age of the Arctic\'**
that will]{.underline} [emerge]{.underline} [is as likely to be one of
**[hostile interaction]{.mark}** among antagonists [as]{.mark}
[one]{.mark} [of]{.mark} **[peaceful]{.mark}
[commerce]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Giving a nod to Sir Halford
Mackinder. Zellen concluded by warning that a proactive military
strategy is warranted because \'the long isolated "Lenaland" along the
Arctic basin will transform into a highly productive and strategically
important "Riinland." transforming the Arctic into tomorrow\'s
equivalent of the Mediterranean, a true strategic, economic and military
crossroads of the world.' In a similar vein, former U.S. Coast Guard
officer Scott Borgerson (2008) has likened the melting Arctic to the
Mediterranean as a parallel zone of contestation. Borgerson argues that
the Mediterranean has avoided outright conflict because antagonistic
nations on opposite sides of its connecting waters have recognized each
other\'s coastal rights and the rule of law; and he argues for reaching
a similar consensus in the Arctic before it is too late. Gorbachev,
Palin. [Zellen. and Borgerson all deploy the **[physical
imagery]{.mark}** of an inland sea [to]{.mark} [construct]{.mark} the
[Arctic]{.mark} [as]{.mark} a **[region]{.mark}**, like the
Mediterranean, that combines **unity with division**]{.underline} in
Giaccaria and Minca's (2011: 348) \'paradoxical interplay \... that
altemate\[s\] narratives of homogeneity and continuity' with those of
heterogeneity and discontinuity.' However, [the flexibility\' of the
mediterranean image - in [which]{.mark} the fluidity' of the sea both
**[erases]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **[magnifies]{.mark}
[difference]{.mark}**]{.underline} - and the intensity of the
\'paradoxical interplay' that results [allows individuals to use the
image [to]{.mark} [support]{.mark} very different **[political]{.mark}
[diagnoses]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For Gorbachev and Palin. the
paradoxical qualities of the mediterranean Arctic are used to highlight
its potential as a space of peace wherein differences may be overcome
through commerce and exchange. For Zellen and Borgerson, these same
qualities are used to highlight its potential as a space of conflict
wherein encounters between naturally separated nations are likely to
breed distrust and acrimony. This theme of the Arctic as a
Mediterranean-like meeting place where the West brushes up against its
'others\' was echoed in an interview that we conducted with brushes up
against its 'others\' was echoed in an interview that we conducted with
a U.S. State Department official who effectively combined the Zellen
Borgerson position (as a divided space, the Arctic is a natural space of
discord) with the Gorbachev/Palin position (that maritime space of
division is also a space of connection, and thus it provides an
environment in which this discord may be overcome): A difficulty for the
Russians is learning how to be part of the community. The old Soviet
ways of doing things still seems to be ingrained in them \.... I think
part of it is the Russian mindset, and getting past that \.... In some
ways, it's like \[the Russians\] have to leam to play nice with others,
and the Arctic may be the place to do that. For this official, [the
fluid [centre of the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}, like the
Mediterranean, **[[creates divisions]{.underline}]{.mark}** (in
particular, it makes it possible for proximate neighbours to have
different social skills in the international community) [but it also
creates the connections that could lead to **transcendence** of those
divisions]{.underline}. Interaction between these disparate neighbours
is seen as potentially productive and increasingly likely due to
connections brought about by an inland sea. However, such connections
are also recognized as inevitably fraught with tension due to
superorganic cultural differences that result from the geographic
division mediated by that same intervening ocean.7 Still others have
used comparisons with the Mediterranean to argue for heightened national
presence in the Arctic region. For instance, an official from the
Government of Greenland likened the Arctic to the Mediterranean not as a
zone of interaction but as a region whose borders ended at some point
\'inland.\' Thus, he argued that just as non-Mediterranean countries
with non-territorial interests in the region should have, at most,
observer status in Mediterranean governance issues, non-Arctic countries
should have little power in governing the Arctic.8 In similar fashion,
in 2010 the Standing Committee on National Defence in Canada's House of
Commons issued a report on \'Canada\'s Arctic Sovereignty\'' (Government
of Canada 2010) that began with a discussion of Stefansson\'s
predictions about the future centrality of the Arctic and then went on
to note that in the context of climate change and the end of the Cold
War Canada must assert its Arctic sovereignty to foster national
development in its portion of Stefansson\'s rapidly emergent Polar
Mediterranean. Conclusion As a response to the continental ism that
pervades our understanding of the world, numerous scholars and
commentators have proposed that we conceive of a world of mediterranean
regions. These regions' oceanic centres allow us to highlight such
phenomena as intensified economic exchange (e.g. Dirlik's \[1998\]
'Pacific Rim'), transnational diasporas (e.g. Gilroy\'s \[1993\] 'Black
Atlantic'), or a 'planetarity' in which individuals are both local and
global (e.g. Craciun\'s \[2009\] circumpolar Arctic ). In all of these
visions[, the character of the ocean at the centre of the region as a
space]{.underline} that simultaneously facilitates movement and
divides [plays a crucial role in establishing norms of **connectivity**
amidst]{.underline} [difference]{.underline}. As Giaccaria and Minca
(2011) and Chambers (2008) note, this narrative has a long history in
the Mediterranean and. as I have argued here, the mobility and
transferability of [these
ideas]{.underline} [of]{.underline} mediterraneaness [have]{.underline} [facilitated]{.underline} [the
[Western]{.mark} [understanding]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
the]{.underline} [[ocean]{.mark} [region]{.mark} [as]{.mark} a
**[postcolonial]{.mark} space**]{.underline}. Two problems emerge,
however, when one looks at the world as a series of mediterraneans. The
first, which has barely been touched on in this chapter but which should
be evident from the other chapters in this book, is that, to quote
Hester Blum (2010: 670), 'the sea is not a metaphor.' [So long as one
views the ocean in the **[abstract]{.mark}** [as]{.mark} a
[central]{.mark} [space]{.mark} - even]{.underline} [as a **central
space** that [performs]{.mark} a complex mix of [functions]{.mark}
[that]{.mark} serve to both unite and divide -]{.underline} [one
[runs]{.mark} the [risk]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [forgetting]{.mark} that
[the]{.mark} [sea is constructed not just through how we think about
it]{.mark}]{.underline}[ [but through how we experience
it]{.underline}]{.mark}[, [as a **material
space**]{.mark}]{.underline} [that is [encountered]{.mark} [by]{.mark}
our **[embodied]{.mark} [practices]{.mark}** as well as the practices of
the ocean's other ([**human** and nonhuman]{.mark}) constitutive
[elements]{.mark}.]{.underline} Any perspective on an ocean region that
focuses on terrestrial societies that are simply 'linked bv' or 'divided
by' (or 'linked and divided by') a central sea are necessarily
incomplete. The second, related problem is that once [the ocean in the
[centre]{.mark} is [reduced]{.mark} [to]{.mark} a
**[metaphor]{.mark}**]{.underline} [then the ocean region similarly can
become a metaphor]{.underline}, and, as scholars of metaphor
caution, [the application of a metaphor, particularly to a space, is
[never]{.mark} [innocent]{.mark}]{.underline} (Brown 2000, Smith and
Katz 1993). In each of the examples from the Caribbean, the Gulf of
Mexico, and the Arctic, the application of the 'Mediterranean\' (a
specific place) to a 'mediterranean\' (a region characterized by a
central sea) is partial. Those who apply signifiers of mediterraneanism
desire some aspects of the Mediterranean idea to travel (e.g. the idea
of'civilization' spreading to 'opposite\' shores) while disabling others
(e.g. the potential for migration in the reverse direction). As just one
example, interviews conducted in Key West revealed that tourists and
residents there had contradictory\' attitudes toward a hypothetical
bridge to Cuba: they supported the benefits that a bridge would bring
for tourist mobility\' and the southward diffusion of cultural norms (in
this case, specifically, tolerance of homosexuality) while fearing that
a bridge would facilitate an influx of Cuban migrants (Steinberg 2007,
Steinbeig and Chapman 2009). Just as the Mediterranean Sea is more than
an imagined surface, the Mediterranean region is more than a trope for
understanding (or performing) postcolonial dynamics of connection amidst
division. Metaphorical references to the Mediterranean do indeed have
these affective resonances, in part because of the properties attributed
to the ocean in the Western imagination and in part because of the
specific Western history of thinking both about and with the
Mediterranean. [But the application of mediterraneanism as a
categor]{.underline}y - its travel as a purportedly immutable mobile -
inevitably involves translation, and this translation [occurs in
specific historic contexts]{.underline}. The very fact that
Mediterranean references in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean have
faded into obscurity while they are on the rise in the Arctic suggests
that despite its appeal to historic constancy and 'natural' physical
geography, the mediterraneanization of a region is dependent as much on
the ambitions of those who would deploy the trope as on the actual
dynamics of connectivity and difference that are present in the
region. [In particular, as]{.underline} [a concept that
[justifies]{.mark} sustained interaction among nations that are deemed
to be at different levels of **[civilizational development]{.mark}**
mediterraneanization]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [the
[fetishization]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the [ocean]{.mark} as a space that
connects while [preserving]{.mark}
**[heterogeneity]{.mark}**]{.underline} [appears most prominently [in
times]{.mark} and spaces [of]{.mark} **[imperial
expansion]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Many imperialist ideologies join the
idealization of natural difference]{.underline} between societies with
the belief that integration of one society into the other is possible,
and inland seas are well positioned to aid in the pairing of these
seemingly contradictory narratives. The ocean in the centre of the
Mediterranean 'water world\' thus [**[cannot]{.mark}** [be]{.mark}
[reduced]{.mark} [to]{.mark} a **[surface]{.mark}**]{.underline},
whether a surface of division, a surface of connection, or - as in the
case of the postcolonial Mediterranean sea - a surface [of **division
amidst connection**]{.underline}. It is all of these, and the image of
it as all of these is regularly applied to construct and interpret a
universe of mediterranean 'water worlds.\' But [this application of the
image occurs amidst actual practices]{.underline} [by which connection
and division are produced, both in and around the water. The
representation of the inner sea as postcolonial space is
one]{.underline} [[component]{.underline}]{.mark} [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} [a
**[wet ontology]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but [to fully understand the
'water worlds\']{.underline} that constitute our planet [this imagery
must be joined with the historically and geographically specific
material practices]{.underline} - of humans and others - [that
constitute **marine space**.]{.underline}

analyzed as a settler colonial society in order to accurately understand
the structural dynamics of race and racism in America)\.... This

other races and thus, by definition, had a right to possess and control
their land and labor.\[2\]\[2\]Shannon Speed, The Persistence of White

dispossession, slavery, and immigrant exploitation were fundamentally
premised on White supremacy)\.... Unlike in "classic colonialism" or
"franchise colonialism" where the aim was to extract resources but where
the colonists did not intend to settle permanently, U.S. settlers

### AT: Fairness

#### [UNCRITICAL EQUITY]{.underline}. It's [violent]{.underline}\-\--that's more [unfair]{.underline}. If unquestioned [procedural]{.underline} fairness is [intrinsically]{.underline} [good]{.underline}, go play [chess]{.underline}!

**Oliver, 23**---Department of Philosophy, Vanderbilt University (Kelly,
"The Limits and Dangers of Risk-Benefit Analysis: From the Refugee
Crisis to the Coronavirus Pandemic," *The Vulnerability of the Human
World: Well-being, Health, Technology and the Environment*, Chapter 2,
pp. 13--27, SpringerLink, dml)

Justice requires continually renegotiating the relationship between
ethics and politics, singular and universal, precisely because there is
always something in excess, something beyond recognition.
[This]{.underline} remainder [is the **[ethical imperative]{.mark}**
that should **keep us awake at night**]{.underline}. [Rather than lead
to **inquietude** or **apathy**]{.underline}, the excess beyond our
[recognition keeps us **actively searching** for better ways to approach
justice **without** resting on]{.underline} moral rules or [risk-benefit
calculations]{.underline} or self-righteous principles. [The
remainder]{.underline} beyond calculation, beyond recognition,
[[demands]{.mark} that [we]{.mark} continue to **[question]{.mark}**
our]{.underline} own principles and **[policies]{.underline}**, [that we
continue to examine our concepts of]{.underline} justice and
**[[fairness]{.underline}]{.mark}** and equality.

An [ethical politics]{.underline} is one in which justice demands the
hyper-vigilance self-critical reflection on where any response---ethical
or political---necessarily falls short. It is an ongoing task that
[**cannot end** with risk-benefit analysis]{.underline}. [Despite the
**ethical insomnia** and **political vertigo** caused by this
interminable self-questioning]{.underline}, [we must
**act**]{.underline}---[even **leap**]{.underline}. Although ultimately
the gap between singularity and universality is impassible, [the
impossibility of achieving justice is **no excuse** for not **attempting
it every single day**]{.underline}.

This tension between politics (which addresses itself to what can be
seen, and to the universal, what can be shared), and ethics (which
addressed itself to what cannot be seen, and to the singular, what
cannot be shared) is the knot at the center of justice.

[Justice is **antithetical** to utilitarian ethics insofar as
individuals are **not fungible units** that can be
exchanged]{.underline}. [Utilitarianism relies on the **calculability**
of]{.underline} pain, suffering, **[survival]{.underline}**, [or the
quality of life]{.underline} itself. And the [utilitarian calculus
relies on determining **thresholds** that separate individuals into
groups]{.underline}, whether it is those who are members of the moral
community or the polis, and those who are not (for example animals), or
those [whose lives are **worth saving** and those whose lives are
**not**]{.underline}.

At some point, however, [this type of line-drawing **inevitably**
becomes either **political** or **arbitrary**]{.underline}. Take debates
over the basis for membership in the moral community. What are the
criteria for membership? Intelligence, language, reason, sentience, the
ability to suffer? And [whatever we decide should be the
criteria]{.underline}, [where do we **draw the line**?]{.underline} For
example, what counts as a language? Does the bees signal dance count?
Or, as some argue, is it merely a code and not a language? What counts
as intelligence? Peter Singer argues that great apes should be extended
rights or admitted to the moral community based on their intelligence,
which is greater than severely mentally disabled persons (see Singer,
1999; McMahan, 2009; Anstötz, 1993).Footnote 11 Some disability scholars
such as Eva Kittay have argued against this comparison, insisting that
human beings should be accorded special status regardless of their
mental abilities (Kittay, 1998a, b, 2009).Footnote 12 The controversy
over Singer's argument demonstrates how [utilitarian line-drawing is
always a **fraught endeavor** that ultimately rests on an **arbitrary
cut off point**]{.underline}.

For example, in Animal Liberation, Singer draws the line between calms
and shellfish, who supposedly cannot feel pain (Singer, 1990,
173--4).Footnote 13 But what if we learn that shellfish can feel pain?
In all these utilitarian endeavors, the liminal cases are unsettling
because they reveal the arbitrariness of borders and the inadequacy of
general classifications. This type of line-drawing or threshold not only
ignores the singularity of each individual, but also poses an arbitrary
or political dividing line as a natural border. The same is true of
national borders used to keep migrants out.

We see something similar in covid triage medicine where triage protocols
disadvantage whole classes of people. Old people, disabled people,
cancer survivors. The coronavirus lays bare the fantasy of calculable
criteria as an ethical way of life. Covid reveals gaping inequities in
the length and quality of life caused by social and economic
"pre-existing conditions." Celebrities and politicians from Madonna to
Andrew Cuomo called the coronavirus the "great equalizer." In March
2020, Cuomo tweeted "This virus is the great equalizer." In reality,
covid is the great unequalizer... Footnote 14

The pandemic forces doctors and nurses to make impossible decisions
about who is given the chance to live and who will die. But these
decisions exist in the context of pre-existing conditions of poverty,
racism, and unequal access to health care that skew any attempt at fair
or reasonable calculation. In a fair and just world, there would be
adequate resources available to everyone. Tragically, the real world is
not so fair or just. And [risk-benefit analysis and calculative
reasoning become the justification for **allowing some to
die**]{.underline}. [[When]{.mark} those [calculations pose as]{.mark}
**justice** or **[fair]{.mark}ness**]{.underline}, [and when they
[allow]{.mark} us to feel **[certain]{.mark}**]{.underline}, even
righteous, [in our **[decisions]{.mark}**]{.underline}, then [they risk
[a **slippery slope**]{.mark} that leads us to a place where **any** and
**all [life]{.mark}** can [become **disposable**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

**[[the BLM is moving forward]{.mark} with the controversial

Offices, all of which were written before new fracking methods were
feasible and **[[without]{.underline}]{.mark}** meaningful tribal
consultation **[or [consent from Navajo Nation and
Pueblos]{.mark}]{.underline}** who consider the Greater Chaco region
sacred. "**[We have fought to have our Pueblo tribal leaders at the

communities, **[and we have gone to D.C. to talk]{.underline}** about
our concerns as indigenous people. **[Yet, [BLM continues to lie]{.mark}
and neglect their responsibilities]{.underline}**." said Julia Bernal,
Co-Director of Pueblo Action Alliance. "That BLM has a mandated 'Trust
Relationship' with Tribal Nations and we must still demand to be
consulted is blatant disrespect. Maybe they think we'll leave, but we're
not going anywhere. Public lands are ancestral lands and we are the
land." Although BLM state headquarters were shuttered today due to a
federal day of mourning for former President George H. W. Bush, Greater
Chaco advocates proceeded with their planned rally to remind agency
officials of their
[promise](https://eplanning.blm.gov/epl-front-office/eplanning/planAndProjectSite.do?methodName=dispatchToPatternPage&currentPageId=98894)
to Tribes and the American public [to develop a new plan to protect
Greater
Chaco](https://climatewest.org/2017/06/22/new-hope-for-greater-chaco-or-more-broken-promises-to-come/).
Advocates wrote personalized messages to the BLM on a large banner that
read "Not Your Sacrifice Zone: We Demand Justice", and taped the banner
to the front wall of BLM headquarters. "Sacrifice Zone" is a label that
has stuck to the Four Corners region since the early 1970s, when the
Nixon Administration began prioritizing energy extraction policies, at
great cost to the communities, land, and water in the Southwest. With
their banner, advocates refused for New Mexico to remain a national
energy sacrifice zone, and demanded instead that the BLM engage in
meaningful tribal and public consultation, and ensure protections for
the environment and public health. Earlier this year, Interior Secretary
Zinke deferred the March lease sale of 4,434 acres [calling for more
cultural consultation admitting the Greater Chaco region needs more
cultural
study](https://www.blm.gov/press-release/blm-defers-oil-and-gas-lease-sale-parcels-new-mexico).
To date, [the BLM has yet to survey over 5,400 cultural resources in the
region]{.underline}. [Instead, the [BLM has rolled back opportunities
for the public to weigh in on oil and gas leasing, shortening "protest"

asserting that drilling without a plan is
illegal](https://www.eenews.net/energywire/stories/1060084765/search?keyword=Chaco).

Mexico
Legislature](https://www.nmlegis.gov/Legislation/Legislation?chamber=H&legType=JM&legNo=5&year=17&AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1),
more than 100 organizations, and over 400,000 public citizens in total
have requested a moratorium on drilling until the BLM updates its
Resource Management Plans. The vast majority of public lands in the San
Juan Basin of Greater Chaco and in the Permian Basin around Greater
Carlsbad Caverns are already leased for oil and gas development, and
**[residents]{.underline}** nearby **[have been dealing with the impacts
of resource extraction for decades]{.underline}**. Today's rally sends
the message to officials that advocates refuse to relent until justice
is upheld. "Despite the Administration's recent climate report that
shows federal fossil fuels account for one quarter of U.S. greenhouse
gas emissions, this December BLM is selling off close to two million
acres of western public and tribal lands for oil and gas, and the New
Mexico agency is the most egregious offender of public process, offering
up nearly 100% of Greater Chaco and Greater Carlsbad for sacrifice,"
said Rebecca Sobel, Climate and Energy Senior Campaigner for WildEarth
Guardians. "It's clear Trump's 'Energy Dominance' agenda will stop at
nothing to sacrifice every inch of public land for private profit, but
today's event shows that the people are also relentless in our
commitment to rise up and demand justice for Greater Chaco and beyond."

[The present moment---one of [climate catastrophe]{.mark}, of [ongoing
genocide]{.mark} and Nakba [in]{.mark} [Gaza]{.mark}, Palestine, of
genocides in [Sudan]{.mark} and [Congo]{.mark}---[demands]{.mark} that
[we direct]{.mark} our dreams and [actions towards]{.mark} making
[worlds]{.mark} [that refuse capitalism]{.mark} and
[dispossession]{.mark} and the spectacular violences required to
maintain them. [The]{.mark} [present moment demands]{.mark} that [we
figure out how to]{.mark} create and [maintain]{.mark} robust
[constellations]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [co-resistance and]{.mark}
[provide]{.mark} material [support]{.mark} [for]{.mark} anticolonial

the present moment demands [that we come together and face our]{.mark}
linked [crises]{.mark} in a manner that ensures the sanctity of the
planet [for all]{.mark} species and generations yet to
come.]{.underline}

The theory of Nibi asks us to think on a scale that is outside the
present moment and our own immediate needs. I'm thinking about Nibi as
theory here because Nibi offers us an invitation to learn from its
embodied practice, a practice of cycling that is global, is permeable
and brings about a continuous rebirth on our planet. [Nibi asks us to
[ground ourselves intimately in land and place]{.mark}, and relate that
grounding to other movements, geographies, cultures and lands[. The
shorelines]{.mark} of our lands, shaped by water[, teach]{.mark} us
[about fractals]{.mark}---patterns repeated across
scales]{.underline}---and show Nishnaabeg that the same practices we
engage in within our family are the practices we engage in as nations
and in the larger universe. Nibi teaches us that our [[thinking is most
powerful when it can connect the intimate to the global and move between
scales]{.mark} effortlessly.]{.underline} [Nibi, [water, is iterative,
resilient and transformative]{.mark} as it carves out spaces from rock
over thousands of years. And water, Nibi is [interdependent and
decentralized]{.mark}, a vessel for multitudes of land-and water-based
species and communities.]{.underline} And finally, water and Nibi always
create more possibilities. Water and Nibi are working within
mino-bimaadiziwin to propel a continuous, global rebirth of life.8

[[Nibi]{.underline}]{.mark}, like all Nishnaabeg theories, [[is]{.mark}
[a]{.mark}n emergent [theory of internationalism.]{.mark} Nibi's
[practices]{.mark} on a small scale [are replicated]{.mark} on a larger
scale. Nibi works with, and [asks us to embrace, uncertainty,
multiplicity, adaptation, iteration and decentralization]{.mark}, as

[Of course, [from]{.mark} [the perspective of capitalism and]{.mark} the
[colonialism]{.mark} that fuels it, these [overlapping zones of
abundance are]{.mark} therefore territories [rich in resources and
capital]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is land that [[must be opened
up]{.mark} [to]{.mark} facilitate the material gain of a few [elite
white men]{.mark}]{.underline}; and thus the chain of lakes and rivers
weaving its way through the centre of our home, from Chi'Nibish to Odawa
Wikwedong (a Michi Saagiig Nishnaabeg name for Georgian Bay, I learned
from Doug), [[and the veins and arteries]{.mark} leading to the lungs of
the systems, the Great Lakes, [need]{.mark}ed [to be choked off]{.mark}
with a series of locks and canals]{.underline} in order to enable large
boats to travel unhindered, [[taking loads of dead bodies]{.mark} to
mills, furriers and smelters, [and bringing loads of living white bodies
to]{.mark} cut down, farm and [occupy]{.mark} [our]{.mark} overlapping
and interlocking [worlds]{.mark} while declaring them private
property.]{.underline}

There are now forty-two locks covering 386 kilometres of waterways in
the Trent-Severn system, giving Parks Canada complete control over the
water level throughout the areas affected.

[And the [impact has been devastating]{.mark}]{.underline} on Kina Gchi
Nishnaabeg ogamig, and [on all the life that makes up our home
formation;]{.underline} and these effects have been felt for hundreds of
years. [The Trent-Severn Waterway has [destroyed]{.mark} the [abundance
of minomiin]{.mark}, the wild rice that was [the foundation of our food
and]{.mark} therefore our economic [system]{.mark}, and that provided
the fuel for migrating ducks, geese and birds to make the long journey
across the big lake.]{.underline}

[[Fluctuating water levels flooded gravesites and marshes]{.mark}, and
[altered]{.mark} the [biodiversity]{.mark} of shorelines]{.underline}.
[[Eels]{.mark} and fish that relied on travel through aquatic ecosystems
have [died out. Bullfrogs]{.mark} have [declined]{.mark}.]{.underline}
And all these losses alter our relational practices, the ones that bring
life together. [[We no longer smoke fish]{.mark}, because we [don't have
access to the fat]{.mark}ty fish required for this.]{.underline}

Meanwhile, the lock system not only depleted things, it brought other
things into our homeland. [It [brought]{.mark} millions of [settlers
and]{.mark} the [infrastructure]{.mark} of settlement]{.underline}. [The
route]{.underline} from the Atlantic to the St. Lawrence through the
Great Lakes to the west [was [valuable, because it could facilitate

[[Mutual aid is a]{.mark} foundational [world-building process]{.mark}
of Nishinaabeg life]{.underline}, and it is easy to find examples of how
it manifests in our daily practices. An infant might first encounter
mutual aid through breastfeeding, the nurturing of attachment between
parent and child through the sharing of sustenance, connection and
warmth. A toddler, marching around, expressing in a true, unfiltered way
every emotion they might be feeling, brings humour and insight and
connection to the family. A teenager engaged in the fast life, pushing
boundaries, swimming in consequences, teaches us about different sorts
of freedom. [In adulthood, [storytellers become conduits of
knowledge]{.mark} as they share narratives---vessels of imagination,
thought, collaboration and co-creation.]{.underline}109 [And [ceremonies
enact healing, peace and intimacy]{.mark}. Hunters gift meat and fish;
harvesters gift rice, maple sugar, berries and medicines; grandparents
gift child care; Elders gift presence and experience. Artists gift
possibilities beyond our current structures. Singers and drummers gift
prayers.]{.underline}

[I think of mutual aid when [I recall Mohawk women]{.mark} gathering
around kitchen tables, [organizing to stop golf]{.mark} course
[expansions]{.mark}, condominium [development]{.mark}, enclosures around
nature areas. Or [when]{.mark} I remember the [women of Grassy

In spite of dominant colonialism---in the face of it---you will witness
a radically different political existence and ethical orientation. This
existence, and this orientation, springs from a different premise than
the politics and economy of extraction. [The premise is to live with the

Solidarity and Revolution

Solidarity is the enduring catch-cry of all serious struggles against
oppression. Solidarity is often misunderstood today as a term that
refers to symbolic gestures of support or as interchangeable with the
concept of allyship, which is about passive support and assumes a
fundamental opposition of interests between identity groups. It is
neither of these things. It is fundamentally about power not symbolism,
and it is based on an understanding of the unity of interests between
different layers of society, embodied most importantly in the working
class.

Solidarity is firstly the process linking together struggles in order to
make each more powerful. This is a necessity because of the system that
we are up against, and it is especially important for groups that are
the most marginalised. [It is impossible for example for Aboriginal
people, trans people, or refugees to win liberation without significant
support from other social layers. They are simply too small and socially
peripheral to confront the ruling class and its state. It is necessary
for social movements that aim to achieve meaningful victories to win
over significant minorities of the population, if not majorities, to
their cause.]{.underline}

This is not to say that within particular movements the leadership and
input of those directly affected by oppression is not crucial. In fact,
precisely because of these experiences, they will often be the most
motivated to initiate struggle and are uniquely placed to inspire others
to join the movement. But it is not sufficient to then call on others to
gather around like a cheer squad. Building solidarity is not based upon
moral chastisement, nor on sympathetic paternalism. It is based
fundamentally on the recognition of shared interests and a collective,
democratic struggle.

[One of the main ways that a common interest between oppressed groups is
established is by recognising the common oppressor. Even without a
thoroughgoing analysis of capitalism, this often becomes clear to
people, especially in the course of struggle. Different groups are
oppressed by the same governments, scapegoated by the same media
outlets, attacked by the same police. As well as having a shared
experience of oppression at the hands of these forces, when our side
deals a blow to them on one front, it is a victory for all of us. For
instance, forcing a government into backing down on one regressive
policy can often have the effect of making them less willing to go after
other groups, as well as giving the broad left more confidence. And
because there is a tendency for struggle to break down the hold of
bourgeois ideology, the more that people engage with struggles not just
against their own oppression, but also against that directed at others,
the more that the ideas that can divide us are undermined.]{.underline}

The movement that the term solidarity is most closely associated with is
that of the working class. There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, it
is the working class that, of all oppressed groups, has the most social
power. In fact it has a social power that is unique across the entire
span of human history, the power to stop the flow of profits at the
point of production. This economic strength gives working-class
demonstrations of solidarity serious muscle. On multiple occasions the
deployment of this power has played a crucial role in struggles against
oppression, for example winning equal pay and land rights in Australia.
[Today there is a lack of awareness of this important aspect of
solidarity, both because identity politics has pushed people's
conception of struggles against oppression into the realms of culture
and symbols, and because the workers' movement is weak. This in turn
makes all of our other struggles weaker. Workers still make up the
majority of most demonstrations today, but usually as individuals,
rather than as an organised force prepared to take strike action or
initiate industrial bans on behalf of the movement. It is undoubtedly
the case that such actions would have substantially strengthened the
recent BLM protests, the climate strikes, and every other social
movement.]{.underline}

[The other reason that the working class generated the solidarity
principle is because it is a collective class. Workers have no power as
individuals; they can only threaten production collectively. This is
true within workplaces, but the collectivity of the working class goes
beyond this. Under capitalism, production is divided into millions of
processes carried out across millions of workplaces. The more that
workers can link up with struggles at other workplaces, the more power
they wield.]{.underline}

A couple of important things flow from this. One is that workers have an
interest in extending solidarity to other groups of workers, and in
breaking down sectionalism and the appearance of competition between
different sections of the working class. Another is that workers have an
interest in overcoming all forms of oppression. The working class
consists of all other oppressed groups, but also oppression sows
ideological and political divisions which are a barrier to collective
struggle.

[For workers to get to a point where they have enough power to challenge
the ruling class for power, thus overcoming their oppression, there
needs to be a high level of democratic coordination across many sections
of the class. For this to happen, workers need to be conscious of the
oppressive and divisive tactics of the ruling class, and to have a
strong sense of common purpose with groups of workers from many
different identity backgrounds. In this sense, conscious political
opposition to oppression is not distinct from or an optional add-on to
class consciousness. High levels of class consciousness -- meaning an
ability for workers to understand their collective class interests and
objectives -- necessarily implies opposition to oppression. This is not
to say that workers come to this consciousness automatically. Struggle,
and even more so, revolution, play a big part in shifting views. Also
crucial is political intervention and argument.]{.underline}

[More than just challenging oppression throughout the course of struggle
and revolution, workers represent the only force that can eradicate
oppression altogether]{.underline}. A socialist society ruled by the
working class will necessarily be run democratically and without
arbitrary forms of discrimination. This comes back again to the nature
of the working class in relation to production. It has no ability to
exploit any other layer because it does all of the work. And it is a
majority class that is only powerful as a collective. Therefore under
workers' rule there is no material basis for arbitrary divisions or
discrimination. Without these material underpinnings, there is no reason
for cultural norms and backward ideas that spring from inequality to
continue. After a period of development under socialism, oppression in
all of its forms will be eradicated. [Where capitalism cannot survive
without oppression, socialism cannot survive with it. The working class
is the only force capable of building such a society and in this way it
represents the only universalising social agent, capable of delivering
its own emancipation and, at the same time, liberation for all of
humanity.]{.underline}

The never-ending flow of the [global [water cycle]{.mark} reciprocally
[nourishes]{.mark} [life]{.mark} on the planet [and]{.mark} teaches us
about [accountability]{.mark}.]{.underline} When part of the cycle is
disrupted, modes of reciprocity are disrupted, and the everyday cycle of
accountability is disturbed.

[[What happens when the]{.mark} accountability [system is
interrupted]{.mark}]{.underline}? Recently, I've been rereading and
thinking with Olúfẹ́mi O. Táíwò's [[Elite Capture]{.underline}]{.mark}:
How the Powerful Took Over Identity Politics (and Everything Else). In
my reading this time, I'm thinking not so much about identity politics
but about what's in parentheses---the "everything else." Táíwò defines
"elite capture" as "a concept that originated in developing countries to
describe the way socially advantaged people tend to gain control over
financial benefits, specifically foreign aid, meant for others." And the
concept, he writes, "[[has also been applied]{.mark} more generally
[to]{.mark} [describe]{.mark} how [political projects]{.mark} can be
hijacked [in principle or effect]{.mark} by the well positioned and
resourced.]{.underline}121

In response to this[, I'm thinking about how [Indigenous]{.mark}
[political projects are hijacked]{.mark} in principle and in effect
[by]{.mark} the [Canad]{.mark}i[a]{.mark}n state,]{.underline} and how
over time Indigenous political projects become more responsive to the
ruling class, or elites, or the state than they are to Indigenous
communities "(I'm also thinking I'm old---since I used to understand
this concept not as "elite capture" but as hegemony122---even as I
admire the brilliance, clarity and power of Táíwò's thinking.)

From an Indigenous perspective---and certainly from within the Michi
Saagiig Nishnaabeg perspective, which [I would characterize as radically
egalitarian---"[elite capture]{.mark}" [arrived through
colonialism]{.mark}. It is a [tool]{.mark} of the system [of
colonialism]{.mark}, one that became [prominent]{.mark} [after]{.mark}
the Indian Act [amendments]{.mark} of 1951, [when]{.mark} Indigenous
[peoples started to organize]{.mark} in ways that made our struggles
more visible to the outside. For one thing, we were then allowed to
gather our resources, and hire lawyers, and organize in ways that had
not been available to us in the past.]{.underline} Over the past forty
years in Canada, the idea of Indigenous self-determination has yielded
an unprecedented degree of recognition for Aboriginal and Treaty Rights
within the apparatus of the state, including through the Constitution
Act of 1982. [At the same time, anti-imperialist [traditions have been
used to refute]{.mark} [the]{.mark} idea that the [relationship]{.mark}
between Indigenous peoples and the state [can be transformed]{.mark}
[by]{.mark} the [politics of recognition]{.mark}.]{.underline} As Glen
Coulthard argues, drawing on Frantz Fanon, the terms of recognition in
Canada are determined solely by the state, and while the politics of
recognition have replaced the state's more overt policy of assimilation,
the state is still trying to extinguish and eliminate Indigenous Title
and power, and to control land and capital.123" "[[But now]{.mark} it
strikes me, reading Táíwò, that Indigenous political [projects]{.mark},
[framed]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the politics of [recognition]{.mark}, [have
set up our rebellions and revolts for elite
capture.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Twenty years of the Slant Lake [blockade]{.mark} [demonstrates]{.mark}
to me that [Indigenous]{.mark} Knowledge [systems]{.mark} [hold]{.mark}
the [potential to not only critique]{.mark} capitalism [but
reveal]{.mark} multiple [potentials to live otherwise]{.mark}.128 These
systems provided my ancestors with the moral and ethical [imperatives to
critique, analyze and revolt]{.mark}]{.underline}. I'm here today, in no
small part, because of how my ancestors acted and lived within those
moral imperatives. This teaches me that [we don't need to rely solely on
anti-imperialist and anti-colonial traditions to critique our present
moment; [we]{.mark} also [can]{.mark} [draw upon our own]{.mark}
intimate anti-colonial [tradition]{.mark},]{.underline} one that is at
once theory and communal embodied practice. [Our [contribution]{.mark}
[internationally]{.mark} to anti-colonialism [comes from]{.mark} these
[bodies of knowledge.]{.mark}]{.underline} I feel the need to articulate
these knowledge systems because I think they can help build worlds that
are otherwise, and because I believe in the value of sintering: sharing
our knowledge with, and as, anti-colonial peoples helps us and helps our
collective movements.

[I believe there must be a [shift away from making Indigenous Knowledge
knowable]{.mark}, legible and shareable by the state and its actors;
instead, we must [refocus this]{.mark} knowledge [towards
liberation]{.mark}.]{.underline} Just because Nishnaabeg worlds are
deeply relational does not mean we should be in relationship with

[The deeply [relational nature of our worlds]{.mark} [means]{.mark} that
[we must fight against systems]{.mark} that attack and undermine the
planetary network of life.]{.underline}

[Indigenous [Knowledge]{.mark} [is]{.mark} regularly [captured by
elites]{.mark}]{.underline}---some working in the academy, some working
for state bureaucracies---[[who separate our knowledge from our bodies,
from our peoples and from political projects and]{.underline}]{.mark},
too often now, [[deploy it in the service of
neoliberalism]{.underline}]{.mark}. Looking back at all my writing, I
can see that this is something I've been writing about all along, since
I began my PhD research years ago, using different framings to respond
to different colonial interventions over the last few decades.

[[Institutions]{.underline}]{.mark} such as universities and the
agencies that fund research were for decades, and still [are, only just
beginning to [acknowledge]{.mark} [Indigenous]{.mark}
[Knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline}, and only ever on their terms. The
recognition of Indigenous Knowledge was [and is being driven [by the
state]{.mark},]{.underline} non-Indigenous researchers and even
environmental activists who see our bodies of knowledge as enhancements
to Western science and Western natural resource management strategies.
[Our [knowledge]{.mark} [is]{.mark} seen]{.underline}, on the one hand,
[as [a potential]{.mark} source [of]{.mark} [solutions for
pending]{.mark} environmental [issues]{.mark} such as climate change,
[and]{.mark} on the other hand as a way of [placating]{.mark} Indigenous
peoples' [resistance]{.mark} and objections to industrial development
[by making us feel included,]{.mark} consulted, part of environmental
impact assessments, [and stakeholders]{.mark} in
decision-making]{.underline}. This is, at best, a partial recognition, a
partial seeing: the state and the academy are interested in information
in English, and in documented data rather than ethics and philosophies.
[Knowledge [Holders]{.mark} [are]{.mark} often [interviewed]{.mark}, and
then these interviews are [transcribed into English]{.mark}, [extracting
the knowledge]{.mark} from the Oral Tradition and Indigenous
languages]{.underline}. Knowledge about colonialism, dispossession and
world endings are left to the side, while knowledge about animal
movements and populations are highlighted. [Indigenous
[understandings]{.mark} of the world [are]{.mark} processed,
depoliticized, [sanitized and colonized into a form that is]{.mark}
nearly [unrecognizable]{.mark}]{.underline} to the Knowledge Holders who

### AT: Alt Solves Case

#### Anti-capitalist movements have historically put demands for decolonization on the backburner.

**MacDonald 17** (Evan, Acting Senior Governance Analyst in the
Government of Alberta, "Settler Colonial Pseudo-Solidarity: Indigenous
Peoples and the Occupy Movement in Canada," Political Science
Undergraduate Review, Volume 2, Issue 2, Winter 2017, pp. 22-23,
<https://doi.org/10.29173/psur32>, iliyan)

To explore these divides in practice, I turn to the experiences of
indigenous activists analyzing the Occupy movement within Canada. [There
was only [one]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Occupy group]{.underline}]{.mark}
in Canada [that]{.underline} "[[adopted a statement of]{.underline}
[unity that took indigenous sovereignty as]{.underline}
**[foundational]{.underline}**]{.mark} to its analysis", which was
#OccupyWinnipeg, and very few others acknowledged colonialism through
their online activities. Similar [[disengagements can be seen at other
cities]{.underline}]{.mark} where Occupy was strong: [[in
Oakland]{.underline},]{.mark} CA [the [movement **refused** to **change
its name**]{.mark}]{.underline} after critique by indigenous peoples,
and [[in Montreal concerns]{.mark} over decolonization [were
considered]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[supplemental]{.underline}**]{.mark}
to the overall goal of confronting neoliberalism.
[[Occupy]{.underline}]{.mark} Montreal [[exhibits a
particularly]{.underline} **[stagnating practice]{.underline}**]{.mark}
that many progressive movements undertake: **[[recognition without
action]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [After]{.underline} a diverse group of
[organizations created an enclave within]{.underline}
[Occupy]{.underline} Montreal [[for]{.underline}]{.mark} the purpose of
[[indigenous solidarity]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[no further action was
implemented]{.underline}]{.mark}** by Occupy. This kind of
[[placation]{.mark} that progressive causes]{.underline}
[undertake]{.underline} to seem anti-colonial [is]{.underline}
**[sinister]{.underline}**: [it [undermines]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[decolonial efforts]{.underline}** [while]{.underline} **[gaslighting
decolonial activists]{.underline}**]{.mark} [into supporting their
causes]{.underline}. Occupy Toronto became so fraught with tension that
a group of indigenous scholars held a forum on their differences with
the movement in the aftermath of resistance to indigenous leadership. In
[[Occupy's attempt to]{.underline}
**[universalize]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the]{.underline} **[struggle of
[workers]{.mark}]{.underline}** under neoliberalism, [it
has]{.underline} [**[disregarded]{.underline}** [the lens of
**decolonization**]{.underline} [in favour of one that]{.underline}
**[best serves]{.underline}** [their narrative]{.underline}]{.mark},
[and in doing so [they have become]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[proponents]{.underline}** [of the]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[legitimation]{.underline}** [of the]{.underline} **[[settler-colonial
state]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[The kind of future that Occupy envisions is]{.underline} a
**[difficult]{.underline}** [one to coexist with]{.underline} a renewed
treaty relationship. With an emphasis on "take back the commons"
rhetoric, anti-neoliberal movements deny the existence of a
treaty-relationship that should govern how Canadians interact with
indigenous power structures and transverse indigenous lands. Occupy in
Canada is governed by each city's General Assembly, but they have main
themes and goals that are universal within the movement: what is most
remembered now is how "activists came together to denounce how increased
inequalities affect people's lives." To discover what [[Occupy's
alternative economy]{.underline}]{.mark} would look like in practice,
one can turn to their camps as an example. Bartering-esque trading could
be found amongst occupiers as a projection of a desired end-state
economy, but in terms of policy options to reverse the trend of growing
inequality literature recommends "revisiting policy instruments such as
government transfers to persons, investments in education and human
capital as well as minimum wage legislation." This kind of imagination
[[could]{.mark} certainly]{.underline} **[[ease the
pain]{.underline}]{.mark}** that many in our neoliberal economic system
endure, [[but it is an appeal to]{.underline} **[colonial
institutions]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[instead of]{.mark} a [rethinking
of how our]{.mark} settler-[colonial state is
organized]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [movement's camps]{.underline}
**[represented]{.underline}** [how]{.underline} **[neoliberal
capitalism]{.underline}** [forces us out of public spaces]{.underline},
but the underlying assumption in that work is that working class
settler-Canadians are the true owners of this territory, and it has been
taken by the capitalist system. There is clearly truth in the assertion
that business interests have transformed our interactions with public
space, however, the rhetorical indigenizing of settlers to this land is
a troubling thought. [Tuck and Yang would call [this method of
combatting neoliberalism as a]{.mark}]{.underline} [settler **[move to
innocence]{.underline}**]{.mark}, specifically reoccupation. They
explain these moves as being "fantasies of easier paths to
reconciliation" where [[settlers can imagine themselves as
being]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[equally oppressed]{.underline}]{.mark}**
to indigenous peoples through a misreading of their own history. [It
is]{.underline} a **[[obfuscation]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[that]{.underline} "has [[legitimize]{.underline}]{.mark}d a set of
[[practices with]{.underline} **[problematic
relationships]{.underline}**]{.mark} to land and to Indigenous
sovereignty." Although in some senses the Occupy movement attempted to
produce its ideal society by having a form of direct democracy through
their General Assemblies, Jessica Yee points out how this and other
progressive causes fail the indigenous peoples of North America:

> This is part of a much larger issue, and in fact there is so much
>
> nationalistic, patriotic language of imperialism wrapped up in
>
> \[left causes\] that it\'s no wonder people can\'t see the erasure of

> existence of the First Peoples of THIS territory that happens
>
> when we get all high and mighty with the pro-America
>
> agendas, and forget our OWN complicity and accountability
>
> to the way things are today

Must the onus always fall to indigenous activists to push progressive
causes into adopting a decolonial lens? [Even when the
predominantly-settler Occupy was encouraged by indigenous
activists]{.underline} across Canada [to centre
decolonization]{.underline} in its efforts, [the idea was]{.underline}
**[rarely]{.underline}** [taken up]{.underline}. [[By trying to create
a]{.underline} **[universally]{.underline}** [anti-imperialist
movement]{.underline}]{.mark} [with a]{.underline}
**[faulty]{.underline}** [decolonial lens]{.underline},
[[it]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[deceptively
embracive]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[vague]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[its inference]{.underline}]{.mark}:
'[[None of us are settlers]{.underline}]{.mark}.'" [[It
is]{.underline}]{.mark} then [[easier]{.underline}]{.mark} in the
Canadian imagination [[to envision a new society for
settlers]{.underline} **[outside of capitalism]{.underline}**
[than]{.underline}]{.mark} [it is to [envision a]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[land of shared sovereignty with indigenous

A Closer Look at White Chauvinist Ideology and the Struggle Against it
Among Communists

[The Philadelphia Workers Organizing Committee (PWOC) paper, "[Racism in
the PWOC]{.mark}," gives a [good]{.mark} [description of white
chauvinist ideology]{.mark} (i.e., the views about national minorities),
its historical [development]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} the various
[components]{.mark} of white chauvinist ideology.]{.underline} Comrades
should refer to that paper for a background on the historical
development and various aspects of white chauvinist ideology. What we
will discuss here is the forms of white chauvinism -- overt racism and
racist paternalism -- and petty-bourgeois chauvinism and its interaction
with white chauvinism. We will examine their impact on the communist
movement.

The PWOC paper discusses the two poles of racist ideology -- [overt
racism and [racist paternalism]{.mark}]{.underline} -- and how they are
each [expressions of the same underlying assumptions about national
minorities]{.underline}. Overt racism is described as open race hatred
and naked force, while racist paternalism is described as "Christian
concern, kindness, and sensitivity" as they were expressed in the early
days of colonialism and slavery. They were each based on the assumption
that the national minority "savages," being "uncivilized, lacking
culture, prone to violence, incapable of self-government, and motivated
more by biological, animal instinct, than human reasoning" -- are in
need of brute force to be kept in their place, or kindness, sensitivity
and uplifting. These poles of racist ideology have been revised as
history has progressed, but the revised expressions are variations on
the same theme. Overt racism expresses itself in our movement in white
comrades who demonstrate open, unveiled white chauvinism in relation to
national minorities. They openly attach racist stereotypes to national
minorities and treat them according to these views. [However, racist
paternalism [is the main form that white chauvinism takes in the
communist movement]{.mark}. This racist paternalism is largely
[influenced by]{.mark} the [bourgeois liberalism]{.mark} that developed
in this country.]{.underline} (See "Racism in the PWOC" p.5)

The ideology of white chauvinism permeates the Communist movement like
all other sectors of U.S. society. [[Communists have no]{.mark}
protective wall to [escape]{.mark} the influence of white chauvinism.
With the advent of the movements of the 60's, [the New Left adopted the
bourgeois liberalism that directed their]{.mark} paternalistic
[activities]{.mark} and views of national minorities. The communist
movement has this heritage and bourgeois liberalism is alive and well
among white Marxist-Leninists.]{.underline}

Bourgeois liberalism is primarily expressed in the communist movement by
[[white comrades]{.mark} [think]{.mark}ing that the way [to be
antiracist is to be a]{.mark} "[friend]{.mark} of the colored people."
They get involved in a mostly Latino rank-and-file caucus at work and
fight racism vigorously with the rest of the caucus members. But [they
don't struggle]{.mark} with white workers at the workplace [for the
same]{.mark} anti-racist [stand]{.mark}.]{.underline} They learn
Spanish, the history of Latin America, and Hispanic culture. They show
the Latino workers that they are on the side of "colored people" and can
really "relate" to them. Some may even marry or develop an intimate
relationship with a Latino to show the depth of their "anti-racism."
Rather than struggle with white workers to take up the demand for
equality on the shop floor and against the white workers' white
chauvinism, they run and tell the caucus members how racist the white
workers are and how they make fun of the way Latinos talk. The white
comrades of course show that they don't hold the same views of Latinos
because they understand Spanish and enjoy all aspects of Hispanic
culture. They actively disassociate themselves from those racist white
workers and show that they are true "friends" of the colored people.

[The underlying [assumption behind the "friend]{.mark} of the colored
people" [approach to the struggle]{.mark} against racism [is that
national minorities are irresponsible, lazy,]{.mark} prom to [violence,
and stupid]{.mark} not because they are inherently that way, but
[because they haven't been given the opportunity]{.mark} to be uplifted
by benevolent white people such as the comrade in the mostly Latino
rank-and-file caucus. What the national [minorities]{.mark}
[need]{.mark} is [a white "friend]{.mark}," who can help them fight for
educational opportunities, jobs, and better living
conditions.]{.underline}

The "friend of the colored people" views racism as "colored folks'
problem" and views him/herself as the benevolent white missionary
reaching out to lend a helping hand to the downtrodden and oppressed.
[This [perspective negates the fact that racism is the central
contradiction dividing the working class]{.mark} and that it is in the
interest of white workers to struggle against it. The ["friend]{.mark}
of the colored people" thereby [liquidates the struggle against racism
by negating the leading role white people have]{.mark} a responsibility
to play in the struggle against racism.]{.underline} White comrades who
adopt this view don't see the importance of taking up a struggle against
white chauvinism among white workers and winning them to the struggle
against racism. Instead, they see themselves as playing the role of the
helper, uplifting the downtrodden.

The bourgeois liberal, "friend of the colored people", views racism
among white workers the real obstacle to equality. The view is that if
it weren't for the "backward" white workers who oppose bussing, national
minorities could get a quality education; if it weren't for the
"backward" white workers who oppose affirmative action, national
minorities could get jobs. The "friend of the colored people" approach
says that white workers are incapable of struggling against the ideology
of white chauvinism, incapable of understanding that the struggle
against racism is in their own interest. That's why the white comrade in
the mostly Latino caucus does not struggle with white workers to join in
the fight for equality at the workplace. He/she views the white workers
as incapable of taking up the struggle against racism in the first place
and mainly responsible for the discriminatory practices on the job in
the second place. The bourgeois liberal sees white workers as hopelessly
racist, and views him/ herself as thoroughly antiracist--his/her
"friendship" with national minority people is proof of that.

[Thus [bourgeois liberalism]{.mark} is clearly [bound up with
petty-bourgeois chauvinism]{.mark}. [Comrades maintain a racist
paternalistic view]{.mark} [of]{.mark} and relationship with national
[minorities]{.mark}, and hold a profound disdain for white workers.
[Petty-bourgeois white comrades]{.mark} in our movement [think
that]{.mark} by virtue of their "[education" and liberal
"enlightenment]{.mark}" that [they "understand"]{.mark} the problems of
national [minorities]{.mark}. Their view of white workers, however, is
that they are totally incapable of comprehending anything but the
football scores and which brand of beer is best, much less the struggle
against racism. These comrades in fact maintain the same view of white
workers that the bourgeoisie does.]{.underline}

[Our [movement is]{.mark} mostly [white]{.mark} and
[petty-bourgeois]{.mark} in composition. It is [important]{.mark} for us
[to]{.mark} [understand and struggle]{.mark} against the
[ideology]{.mark} that influences our practice in keeping national
minorities and working class people out.]{.underline} Petty bourgeois
chauvinism serves to maintain the class composition of our movement and
bar working class people from entering. The fact that our movement is
overwhelmingly petty-bourgeois in composition attests to that. [It shows
what little confidence comrades have in the working class' ability to
grasp Marxism-Leninism and take up the struggle to develop the program,
strategy and tactics for the U.S. revolution.]{.underline}
Petty-bourgeois chauvinism leads comrades to believe that those
currently in the movement, mostly white and petty-bourgeois comrades,
are the only ones capable of taking up the tasks before us. The view is
that workers are incapable of playing a leading role in our movement.
This is the view of the petty-bourgeoisie.

[The struggle against white chauvinism in the communist movement is
pivotal to changing the class as well as racial composition of our
movement. The bulk of advanced workers in the class struggle who will be
won to communism are national minorities. [Once white comrades]{.mark}
are able to [see]{.mark} and understand white chauvinist [ideology in
themselves, they will be equipped to take it up]{.mark} in the working
class [and]{.mark} [unite]{.mark} with advanced workers to build a
multi-national vanguard revolutionary party. But they must also struggle
against petty-bourgeois chauvinism which prevents them from seeing the
real strength and capabilities of working class people]{.underline}.
They must struggle against the bourgeois liberalism that leads them to
be "friends of the colored people" while totally liquidating the
struggle against racism where white comrades have a particular
responsibility to take it up -- among white workers.

[When white comrades are unable and unwilling to wage an ideological
struggle against racism among white workers they have no basis for
uniting with them on the need to build a multi-national
party.]{.underline} And white workers can see the hypocrisy of white
communists who lecture about the struggle against racism knowing full
well that the white communist maintains the same view of national
minorities that he/she assumes the white worker has. This gives the
white communist little credibility in the eyes of white workers.

[Our movement has a "[white only]{.mark}" [policy]{.mark} for new people
and a segregationist policy for national minority comrades already in
it. The most graphic example of the segregationist policy is comrades'
[attitude]{.mark} [toward]{.mark} the National Minority Marxist-Leninist
[Conference]{.mark}]{.underline}. The essence of much of the criticisms
of the Planning Committee (PC) from white comrades was the national
minorities have no right to unite around politics. The PC should have
invited people based on their color, regardless of their political
perspective, the argument contends. In other words, "we'll take care of
the party-building and you take care of colored affairs." The
segregationist policy says that national minority comrades should be and
are only capable of being concerned with racism, the national question,
and mass work. White comrades do not expect any more from national
minority comrades than that, and in fact promote the ghettoization of
the tasks of national minority comrades. So national minority comrades
are approached to talk to other national minorities and recruit them,
they are consulted around how to take up the struggle against racism and
white chauvinism in the local center or in a mass form. But do white
comrades ever think of talking to a national minority comrade about
his/her understanding of the ideological underpinnings of ultra-leftism?
Or Lenin's polemics with the Narodniks? [White comrades don't think of
doing that because their overt racism says that national minorities have
no understanding of Lenin's theoretical formulations. Their racist
paternalism leads them to think that if anything, they have to teach
national minority comrades about the essence of Lenin's work. Either
way, they don't think they have anything to learn from national minority
comrades about Marxism-Leninism.]{.underline}

[The "[whites only" policy]{.mark} for those outside the organized
communist movement has many expressions ranging from the overt
racism]{.underline} -- "there are no national minority Marxist-Leninists
out there" -- [to racist paternalism -- ["those we know have to be
taught how to take up the all-sided tasks of
Marxism-Leninism".]{.mark}]{.underline}

[White chauvinism has our comrades not even thinking about uniting with
national minority advanced forces around the 18 points of unity and the
need for a single ideological center.]{.underline} It has our comrades
thinking that the national minority Marxist-Leninists they know have too
many weaknesses (nationalism, ultra-leftism, individualism, etc.) to
join in the party-building process. How many white petty-bourgeois
intellectuals have white comrades seen as "easier" to talk to about
party-building than national minority comrades? [They see the weaknesses
of the white petty-bourgeois intellectual as less important and severe
as those of national minorities. And they have no confidence in national
minorities' ability to overcome those weaknesses. White chauvinism has
our comrades viewing national minority Marxist-Leninists who have been
Marxist-Leninists for the past ten years as people who need to be
uplifted and enlightened rather than united with. They don't see the
strengths these national minority comrades have, and view themselves as
understanding better and being more committed to Marxism-Leninism than
national minority comrades.]{.underline} White comrades may be "friends"
with the national minority advanced forces they know. They may be
neighbors, work together, have dinner together, but the white comrades
never think to talk to them about party-building and the 18 principles
of unity -- just racism, work, and Aretha Franklin. White comrades may
be "friends" with national minority comrades, but they only talk td them
about racism and the national question--not how the national minority
comrades see uniting the tendency.

While our comrades maintain a white chauvinist view of national
minorities, national minorities represent the bulk of advanced workers
in the class. [[Our comrades' white chauvinism says that national
minorities are incapable of taking up the all-sided tasks of
party-building, yet national minority Marxist-Leninists have an advanced
understanding of these tasks]{.underline}]{.mark}. The advanced
character of the contributions of national minorities to the class
struggle and the party-building movement is directly linked to the
revolutionary nature of the liberation movements of oppressed national
minorities and the class composition of the majority of the national
minority population. The struggles national minorities engage in are not
won without a fight. [The bourgeoisie responded to the Civil Rights
Movement with attack dogs, black-jacks, and guns. These are the
struggles that have taught national minorities concretely about the real
nature of the state under capitalism, the limits of bourgeois democracy
and the relationship between capitalism and racism. These struggles have
armed national minorities with a concrete understanding of the absolute
necessity to defeat capitalism as well as the need for organization and
leadership in order to win a struggle for socialism]{.underline}. [These
struggles have shown national minorities the various forms of
opportunism that emerge within the class struggle and liberation
movements of oppressed national minorities, and sharpened their ability
to struggle against those forms at opportunism.]{.underline} This is the
understanding that national minorities bring to the party-building
movement. The effort to build multi-national unity is not just to have a
good head-count to show off. The effort to build multi-national unity is
to insure that the program, strategy and tactics we develop is truly
revolutionary in content, and that we establish a genuine advanced
detachment of the working class. And racism is the main obstacle to
building multinational unity in our movement.

[[White comrades must assume their responsibility]{.mark} for playing
the leading role in the struggle against racism]{.underline}. [They have
to [look honestly at their racist practice]{.mark} in relation to
national minorities and struggle against the white chauvinist ideology
that has impacted that practice.]{.underline} They have to be prepared
to face it and struggle each and every day against the influence that
white chauvinism has on them. And they must take it up consistently and
vigorously with white comrades in our movement and with white workers.
To do otherwise is to liquidate the struggle against racism.

If white comrades abandon the struggle against racism in our movement
the burden of the struggle is placed on national minority comrades which
places serious limits on the struggle as long as national minorities are
forced to assume the primary responsibility for struggling against
racism in our movement; the character of our movement will not just
remain the same, but become more white and isolated from the mass
movement. When national minorities have to assume the burden of
struggling with white comrades around their racism, the overt racist
response on the part of our comrades is that they are being unjustly
attacked by a bunch of lunatics. And the racist paternalistic response
is to get behind the national minorities and "help" them, be
sympathetic, but not assume responsibility for their white comrades. The
"whites only" policy and the segregationist policy in our movement will
be maintained. And most national minority comrades are bound to leave
under those circumstances.

[For [white comrades]{.mark} to [refuse to take up the struggle
against]{.mark} white [chauvinism]{.mark} in our movement is [to
protect]{.mark} the white and petty-bourgeois strata that presently
comprises and dominates the bulk of the organized party-building
movement. It means that protecting the current racial and class
character of our movement is [more important to comrades than socialist
revolution]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### AT: Root Cause

#### Colonization is the [basis]{.underline} of modern capitalism.

**Stenport and Belanger 17** (Anna Westerstahl, Professor and Chair of
the School of Modern Languages at Georgia Institute of Technology,
Noelle, Independent Researcher, "The Politics of Color in the Arctic
Landscape: Blackness at the Center of Frederic Edwin Church\'s Aurora
Borealis and the Legacy of 19th-Century Limits of Representation,"

Aurora Borealis reflects the themes of exploration and imperial
expansion that are echoed in the narrative subject of the painting and
in its brilliant display of color. In his article on color in the 19th
century, Peter John Brownlee notes, "After 1800 . . . an already brisk
international trade expanded significantly with the introduction of
extensive networks of mining, manufacturing, and distribution.
[As]{.underline} [part of the]{.underline} vast technological, economic,
and cultural [transformations]{.underline} of the 19^th^ century, these
[developments]{.underline} helped to further [blur]{.underline} already
**[indistinct boundaries]{.underline}** between science and art."31
Color had been a staple of the global economy for some time. Due in part
to their ease of transport, pigments and dyes had proved lucrative
commodities.32 By the 19^th^ century, chemically produced pigments and
dyes were being developed and were beginning to replace some of the
older mineral- and plantbased substances. However, the latter colors
were still being produced and used. In fact, the mining, extraction, and
production of dyes and pigments continued to contribute to the bustling
global economy at the time. [Alongside]{.underline} **[colonial
monopolies]{.underline}** on pigments and dyes, precious
**[metals]{.underline}** (and guano) [were **extracted**]{.underline}
[from]{.underline} **[colonized territories]{.underline}**.33 In the
19th century, the [[acquisition of]{.underline}
[territories]{.underline}]{.mark} **[ripe]{.underline}**
[with]{.underline} **[natural resources]{.underline}**, especially
precious metals, minerals, dyes, and people, was
[**[driving]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} **[global
economy]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Aurora Borealis, too, is grounded in
such a global circulation and trade of color.

Indeed, Church's painting was itself subject to global circulation.
Aurora Borealis made an Atlantic crossing when it was exhibited in
London in 1865.34 That year, along with Aurora Borealis, some of
Church's Latin American landscapes were brought together for another
London exhibition.35 In exhibiting these paintings together outside
their American context, the Arctic and Latin America were even more
closely connected and transformed into imaginary landscapes. In Aurora
Borealis, the ship [United States]{.underline} can thus [stand in
for]{.underline} the **[countless vessels]{.underline}** [sponsored
by]{.underline} **[Western governments]{.underline}** and private
enterprises that had sought the Northwest Passage in order to expand and
control international commerce. Simon Gikandi has demonstrated that this
"**[[new]{.underline}]{.mark}**" **[[global]{.mark}
[economy]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[had]{.underline}
**[blackness]{.underline}** [at its center]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and
that [the]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[violence]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [**[ugliness]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}
**[enslavement]{.underline}** [shaped]{.underline}]{.mark} [theories of
**taste**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[beauty]{.underline}** [as
well as [the practice of]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[high
culture]{.underline}**]{.mark}: "the ideal of politeness. . . was also
intimately connected to the commercial activities and the rather
impolite business of moneymaking; [in an]{.underline} age of
unprecedented economic expansion, questions of trade and exchange were
considered not anterior to cultural refinement but expressive of
it---their condition of possibility."36 [As a region]{.underline}, [the
[Arctic was]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[connected]{.underline}** [to
the]{.underline}]{.mark} [**[globally interconnected
trading]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}
**[slavery]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[and the production and circulation
of consumer goods]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [**[transatlantic
routes]{.underline}** [carried]{.underline} **[black
bodies]{.underline}** [one way]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and]{.underline}
**[Arctic natural resources]{.underline}**]{.mark}---**[[marine-mammal
blubber]{.underline}]{.mark}** [for]{.underline} **[soap]{.underline}**
[[and]{.underline} **[candle fuel]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[and]{.underline} **[[whale bones]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[for]{.underline} **[corsets]{.underline}** ---[[another
way]{.underline}]{.mark}, though a long history of
**[[metaphorical]{.underline}]{.mark}**
"**[[whiteness]{.underline}]{.mark}**" has **[[occluded these
relationships]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

In this way the blackness at the center of Aurora Borealis becomes among
other things a metaphor for an interconnected set of commercial
strategies and the circulation of images. Gikandi contends that
**[[slavery]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[and]{.mark} the]{.underline}
**[[culture]{.underline}]{.mark}** of taste [[were]{.underline}]{.mark}
"**[[conjoined]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[by a]{.underline} **[new global
economy]{.underline}** [that revolved]{.underline} [around
the]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[sale]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[black bodies]{.underline}]{.mark}** on the
West African coast, [[their]{.underline}]{.mark} en**[[forced
labor]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the Americas, [[and their use in
the]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[production of
goods]{.underline}]{.mark}**---primarily tobacco, coffee and
sugar---that were to epitomize luxurious living and the culture of
taste."37 Gikandi thus helps us understand how black bodies formed the
condition of possibility for all those fine practices and objects that
made up high culture.

[However, [without simultaneous access to colonies]{.mark} Northwestern
European [states would not have been able to]{.mark} increasingly
[specialize in industrial production]{.mark}, which they traded for
land- and labor-intensive goods from other regions]{.underline}
(Pomeranz 264ff ). The limited amount of land in Western Europe was not
a problem, as a combination of genocide and epidemics in America, the
slave trade, and Asian demand for American silver meant that the region
had access to an almost endless amount of land. [The colonies also
provided [a]{.mark} solution to the rapid population growth associated
with industrialization]{.underline}, as they became a popular
destination for emigrants unable to find work in Europe---a privilege
not accessible to later efforts at industrialization in the Global East
and South. [The **[rise of capitalism toward global hegemony]{.mark}
therefore [would not have been possible without]{.mark} its affinity
toward [colonial expansion]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In the labor
intensive system centered on East Asia/China, household-based production
prevailed, the majority of producers were not separated from their means
of subsistence, and states carefully curtailed the power of would-be
capitalists (Arrighi 2007, 57, 321ff; Graeber 2011, 259ff ). In
[contrast, European [capitalism]{.mark} is a capital- and
resource-intensive system that [combines both wage labor and unfree
labor]{.mark}, within it producers were separated from the means of
production and [capitalists]{.mark} have [managed to impose]{.mark}
their particular [class interest onto political
authorities]{.mark}.]{.underline} The latter point is central here. It
does not imply that capitalists somehow control states, but that [states
require corporate profits for taxes to fund their expenditures and are
thus structurally dependent on the success of local
capitalists]{.underline}. [The strength of the capitalist system until
the nineteenth century was not primarily based on economic power, but on
military superiority]{.underline}, as illustrated by the Opium Wars
(Arrighi 2007, 265ff ). This military power derives from its
embeddedness in the capitalist system. The commercialization of war and
continuous arms races in the leading capitalist states of an era have
led to self-reproducing spirals: military expenditure increases the
prosperity of a particular political formation, which in turn increases
taxes and enables new military expenditure. The [expansion of this
system through colonization and trade provides the resources that in
turn enable even further expansion. **[Colonialism is]{.mark} thus
[structurally written into capitalism's DNA]{.mark}**, already [played a
central role in the emergence]{.mark} of capitalism [and was]{.mark} a
[necessary condition for its rise to global
dominance]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}via the dismantling of the East
Asian tribute trade system. From this perspective, [the **[conquest of
the Americas, including]{.mark} the [genocide of Indigenous
groups]{.mark}**, the slave trade and the race for Africa, **[is not a
legacy of pre-capitalist irrationality]{.mark}, [but]{.mark}** [**a
central component**]{.mark} of the globalizing competition for wealth
and power. [Capitalism is driven by endless accumulation]{.mark} and
this expansionary pressure creates incentives for coalitions of states
with the companies located within them to seek unilateral access to
other territories, dispossessing land and labor]{.underline}, tilting
terms of trade in their favor via military force, etc. These systemic
pressures are important to keep in mind vis-à-vis current debates about
the geopolitical and economic implications of the rise of East Asia and
the possibility of a multi-polar world order. For a consideration of
capitalism and racism, such a global perspective on the central role of
colonialism for capitalism is one side of the coin; the other is the
associated formation of racist structures within political territories.
We turn to the latter in the next section.

In 1492, Europe was moving out of feudalism and toward capitalism, but
at a sluggish pace. The English woolen industry was growing, not (as is
often claimed) as a step toward imminent industrialization, but as a
result of the decline of woolens in other parts of Europe (Miskimin,
1969). Rural growth was taking place but this reflected in part a
population recovery after the great plagues and in part an ongoing and
not at all sudden commercialization (Abel, 1980). Towns were growing
only slowly, and urban population was still only a tiny fraction of
total population (de Vries, 1984). (Some extra-European regions had
larger fractions and larger cities.) In fact, there were strong
indications of economic downturn rather than growth (Hodgett, 1972;
Lopez and Miskimin, 1961-62; Smith, 1969). The Italian Renaissance was
neither an economic nor a technological revolution (Lopez, 1953;
Thorndyke, 1943), and did not raise the Italian protocapitalist centers
above the level of other centers in the hemispheric network. Nothing in
the European landscape of 1492 would suggest that a revolutionary
transformation was about to take place. [Just a few decades later the
rate of change speeded up dramatically, and Europe clearly entered a
period of rapid metamorphosis. Change continued to accelerate, and now
we witness the true rise of the bourgeoisie. Non-industrial [capitalist
production increased rapidly]{.mark} in northwestern Europe, while
feudal production in that region declined toward extinction.
Protocapitalist centers expanded]{.underline}. The bourgeoisie gained
power as a class and eventually pulled off its bourgeois revolution,
taking full power in the Low Countries and England in the mid-17^th^
century and coming near to that stage in a number of other countries (I
will use the date 1688, the date of England's "Glorius Revolution," as
the token for the bourgeois revolution, as I am using 1492 as the token
for the origin of colonialism.) Did this transformation result from
internal causes within Europe? [I will argue rather that external
factors - broadly, **[colonialism]{.mark} -- [initiated the
transformation]{.mark},** continued to feed it, [and sparked]{.mark}
those [internal changes which eventually produced]{.mark} the
[revolutionary transformations]{.mark} in economy and society but [which
could not have done so without]{.mark} the continuing impact of
[colonialism]{.mark} throughout the period of 1492-1688. In a sense,
then, **[colonialism led to the rise of
capitalism]{.mark}**.]{.underline} (Or look at it this way: if Indian
protocapitalist centers had been the ones to reach first, and then
conquer, America, and so initiate a period of Indian colonialism,
capitalism would have risen first in India. Or Songhay, China, etc.)
[**[Colonial enterprise was from the outset]{.mark} a matter [of capital
accumulation]{.mark}**.]{.underline} No matter if some elements of
feudalism were incorporated in legal and land-granting systems, and if
the Iberian governments took a substantial (though usually
over-estimated) share of the profits. No matter if the people involved
in the process, in the colonial world and in Europe, played a great
number of different roles, some of which defy classification as to mode
of production. Questions pertaining to these matters deserve discussion
among Marxists but they do not alter the empirical reality which we are
discussing here. [The [goal of all European individuals]{.mark} and
groups [involved in]{.mark} the [colonial process]{.mark} (clergy apart)
[was to make money]{.mark}.]{.underline} The leading group was the
protocapitalist class, not only merchants but also industrialists,
profit-minded landlords (titled and untitled), shipowners, carters,
shopkeepers, small-scale artisan-manufacturers, and others; not only
Iberian but also Italian, Flemish, Dutch, German, English, French. [This
class [community took]{.mark} its [profit from American]{.mark} (and
secondarily Asian and African) [enterprise and invested]{.mark} part of
[it in Europe]{.mark}, buying land and developing commercial
agriculture, [developing industries]{.mark} which were [associated
with]{.mark} the [expanding colonial enterprise or]{.mark} with the
[economic growth within]{.mark} Europe [which]{.mark} the [colonial
enterprise engendered]{.mark}.]{.underline} Part of the accumulated
capital was ploughed back into additional colonial risk enterprise, in
the Americas and in the new trading enterprises in southern Asia,
Africa, and the Levant. [[Colonial enterprise]{.mark} in the 16^th^
century and the early 17^th^ [generated]{.mark} an [immense]{.mark}
amount of [capital]{.mark}, and did so in many ways.]{.underline} One
was gold and silver mining (and plunder). A second was plantation
agriculture, principally, in that period, in Brazil. A third was the
trade with Asia in spices, cloth, and the like. A fourth and by no means
minor element was the profit returned to European houses from a great
variety of productive and commercial enterprises in the colonial world,
including profit on production for local use, on imports from Europe, on
a variety of secondary exports from the Americas (leather, dyestuffs,
etc.), on intercontinental trade outside of Europe (e.g., between Mexico
and Peru, Mexico and the Philippines, Africa and Asia), and the like. A
fifth way of accumulating was slaving. A sixth, piracy (see Dunn, 1972).
And there were others. Notice that most of this is normal capital
accumulation, not really that slippery thing called "primitive
accumulation." Surplus value from wage labor, not to mention forced
labor, was involved in all of this, and most of it was value from
production, not simply from trade. [[Nothing could be more erroneous
than to]{.mark} dismiss 16^th^-century colonial enterprise as a compound

## Antiblackness K

### AT: Afropessimism 

#### Afropessimists characterization of settler colonialism is inaccurate and unhelpful -- it forecloses relationality for resisting domination 

**Day '15** -- Ikyo Day is an associate professor of English at Mount
Holyoke College and author of *Alien Capital: Asian Racialization and
the Logic of Settler Colonial Capitalism* (Fall 2015, *Being or
Nothingness: Indigeneity, Antiblackness, and Settler Colonial*
*Critique*, https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/jcritethnstud.1.2.0102,
soyam)

To begin digesting these claims, one finds a certain contradiction in
the empirical relation of Indigeneity and blackness that Wilderson and
Sexton present. [Wilderson's]{.underline} [suggestion]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} a **[shared]{.underline}** [genocidal **antagonism**
would potentially]{.underline} [form]{.underline} a [**correspondence**
between **Indigeneity** and **antiblackness**]{.underline} is somewhat
at odds with Sexton's claim that racial slavery subsumes all other
modalities of power. It is only through our realization of the
exceptionality of antiblackness, Sexton writes, that "might help not
only to break down false dichotomies, and perhaps pose a truer one, but
also to reveal the ways that the study of slavery is already and of
necessity the study of capitalism, colonialism, and settler colonialism,
among other things."43 Here I interpret [[Sexton's]{.mark}
**[rejection]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} a
[Native]{.mark}]{.underline}/[[settler]{.mark}
**[opposition]{.mark}**]{.underline} as [[among]{.mark}]{.underline} the
"**[[false dichotomies]{.underline}]{.mark}**" that [[should be]{.mark}
**[dispensed]{.mark}**]{.underline} with [in order to install a
black]{.underline}/ nonblack "**[truer]{.underline}**"
**[dichotomy]{.underline}**. However, and this is my point, Wilderson's
and Sexton's divergent emphases put the empirical status of Indigeneity
in flux. On the one hand, Indigenous sovereignty is conceptualized
primarily as a screen: an "obscene supplement" of the settler
nation-state,44 an antiblack expression of false consciousness, or a
lost opportunity to apply the motif of genocide and share in an
antagonism that relates to black social death. That is, the claim that
sovereignty "de-escalates" a genocidal antagonism to "conflict" suggests
that a more authentic truth of Indigeneity is genocide, which means that
the unrealized fact of Indigeneity is its empirical analogy to black
social death. But on the other hand, [Sexton forcefully
**rejects**]{.underline} [any]{.underline}
**[[claim]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to an empirically based]{.underline}
[analogy]{.underline}, [claiming [that]{.mark}
**[antiblackness]{.mark}** **[trumps]{.mark}**
**[Indigeneity]{.mark}**]{.underline} just as [racial **slavery** trumps
**settler colonialism**]{.underline}. And so the [potential relations
that]{.underline} [Wilderson]{.underline} [sets up through]{.underline}
a [critique]{.underline} [of]{.underline} [sovereignty]{.underline}
[are]{.underline} at best irrelevant or at worse [false]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} Sexton's [**absolute** claim that]{.underline}
[slavery]{.underline} [stands]{.underline} **[alone]{.underline}** [as
the]{.underline} "**[threshold]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} [the
**political world**]{.underline}."45 I suggest that [[this
wavering]{.mark}
**[relation]{.mark}**]{.underline}/**[[nonrelation]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[antiblackness]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[and]{.underline} **[Indigeneity]{.underline}** exhibited
[in]{.underline} [Wilderson's and Sexton's work
[reveal]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the]{.mark} **[problem]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark} any **[totalizing]{.mark}**
**[approach]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[heterogeneous]{.underline}** [constitution]{.underline} [of **[racial
difference]{.mark}** in settler]{.underline} [colonies]{.underline}.

Beyond this inconsistency, the [liberal multiculturalist
agenda]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [Wilderson]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [Sexton]{.underline} [project]{.underline}
[into]{.underline} [Indigenous]{.underline} [sovereignty]{.underline}
willfully [evacuates any Indigenous refusal of]{.underline} a [colonial
politics of recognition]{.underline}. Among other broad strokes, [Sexton
states]{.underline}, "as a rule, [Native Studies]{.underline}
**[reproduces]{.underline}** the **[dominant]{.underline}** liberal
political **[narrative]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}
[emancipation]{.underline} and enfranchisement."46 This provides a basis
for Wilderson's assertion that [Indigenous **sovereignty
engages**]{.underline} [in]{.underline} a liberal [**politics** of
**state legitimation**]{.underline} through recognition because
"treaties are forms of articulation" that buttress "the interlocutory
life of America as a coherent (albeit genocidal) idea."47 But [such a
**depoliticized**]{.underline} liberal [project]{.underline}
[is]{.underline} frankly [incompatible]{.underline} [with]{.underline}
[Indigenous]{.underline} activism and [scholarship]{.underline} that
emerges from Native studies in North America. The main argument in Glen
Sean Coulthard's book Red Skin, White Masks is to [categorically
**reject**]{.underline} "the liberal [**recognition**-**based**
**approach**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [Indigenous]{.underline}
[selfdetermination]{.underline}."48

[[This is not a politics of legitimizing]{.underline} [Indigenous
nations through state recognition]{.underline} [but]{.underline}]{.mark}
[rather]{.underline} [[one]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
**[refusal]{.underline}**]{.mark}, a refusal [[to be
**recognized**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and]{.underline} thus
[interpellated]{.underline} [by the settler colonial
nation-state]{.underline}. Drawing on Fanon[, Coulthard describes the
"**[necessity]{.underline}** [on the part of the **oppressed**
to]{.underline} '[turn]{.underline} [away']{.underline}
[from]{.underline}]{.mark} their other-oriented
[**[master]{.mark}**-**[dependency]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} to [instead]{.underline}
**[[struggle]{.underline}]{.mark}** for freedom [[on their own
terms]{.underline}]{.mark} and in accordance with their own values."49
[[It is]{.mark} also [difficult to reconcile the depoliticized narrative
of "resurgence and recovery" that Wilderson and Sexton attribute to
Indigenous sovereignty in the face of Idle No
**More**]{.mark}]{.underline}, the [**anticapitalist** Indigenous
sovereignty **movement** in Canada]{.underline}
[[whose]{.underline}]{.mark} [national]{.underline}
**[railway]{.underline}** and **[highway
[blockades]{.mark}]{.underline}** have seriously
[[destabilized]{.underline} the [**expropriation**
of]{.underline}]{.mark} natural **[[resources]{.mark}]{.underline}** for
the global market. [[These are]{.underline}]{.mark} examples that
Coulthard describes as "[[direct action]{.underline}]{.mark}" [[rather
than negotiation]{.underline}]{.mark}---in other words,
**[[antagonism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [**[not]{.mark}**
**[conflict]{.mark}** **[resolution]{.mark}**]{.underline}:

> They \[**[blockades]{.underline}**\] are a [**crucial** act of

[[These]{.underline} [tactics]{.underline} [are part
of]{.underline}]{.mark} what Audra Simpson calls [[a]{.underline}
"**[cartography]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[of]{.mark}
**[refusal]{.mark}**]{.underline}[" that
"**[negates]{.underline}**]{.mark} the [**[authority]{.mark}** of the

[impossible]{.underline} [to frame]{.underline} [the blockade
movement]{.underline}, which has [become the greatest threat to
Canada's]{.underline} [resource]{.underline} [agenda]{.underline},52 [as
a struggle for]{.underline} "[enfranchisement]{.underline}." **[Idle No

[with]{.underline} the [Canadian]{.underline}
**[nation-state]{.underline}**; [it]{.underline} [is]{.underline} in
[a]{.underline} **[struggle]{.underline}** [against]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} very [premise]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
[settler]{.underline} [colonial]{.underline} [capitalism]{.underline}
that requires the [elimination]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
[Indigenous]{.underline} [peoples]{.underline}. As Coulthard states
unambiguously, "[For Indigenous nations to live]{.underline},
**[capitalism must die]{.underline}**."53

### Perm -- Dialectics 

#### This debate is not a question of which structure caused the other, blackness and colonialism exist dialectical relation co-producing modern violence 

**Day '15** -- Ikyo Day is an associate professor of English at Mount
Holyoke College and author of *Alien Capital: Asian Racialization and
the Logic of Settler Colonial Capitalism* (Fall 2015, *Being or
Nothingness: Indigeneity, Antiblackness, and Settler Colonial*
*Critique*, https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/jcritethnstud.1.2.0102,
soyam)

But perhaps my own defense of [Indigenous **decolonization**
movements]{.underline} for sovereignty [begs]{.underline}
[a]{.underline} **[larger]{.underline}** [question]{.underline}
[about]{.underline} [whether **sovereignty**]{.underline} in itself
[offers a **radical** politics that can **encompass**]{.underline} or
mobilize a **[black radical tradition]{.underline}**
[rooted]{.underline} [in]{.underline} the project of
**[abolition]{.underline}**. And it is here that I agree with Sexton's
intervention to problematize the idea that antiracist agendas must
emerge from the foundational priority of Indigenous sovereignty and
restoration of land.54 But [[against]{.underline} [the
**totalizing**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[frame]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
**[Afro]{.mark}-[pessimism]{.mark}**[, I want to
stress]{.mark}]{.underline} instead [[the pitfalls of any]{.underline}
**[antidialectical]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[[approach]{.underline}]{.mark} to the political economy of the settler
colonial racial state from the position of either Indigenous or
antiblack exceptionalism. [[**Settler colonial** racial
**capitalism**]{.underline} [is]{.underline}]{.mark} not a thing [[but a
**social** relation]{.underline}]{.mark}. As such, [it is not produced
out]{.underline} of the [causal relationships]{.underline} [that
**Sexton** puts forward]{.underline} here: "Slavery, as it were,
precedes and prepares the way for colonialism, its forebear or fundament
or support. Colonialism, as it were, the issue or heir of slavery, its
outgrowth or edifice or monument."55 The nearly totalizing black
existential frame is similarly based on a questionable construction of
epistemic privilege:

> \[black existence\] does relate to the totality; it indicates the
> (repressed) truth of the political and economic system. That is to
> say, the whole range of positions within the racial formation is most
> fully understood from this vantage point, not unlike the way in which
> the range of gender and sexual variance under patriarchal and
> heteronormative regimes is most fully understood through lenses that
> are feminist and queer.56

According to Sexton, no other oppression is reducible to antiblackness,
but the relative totality of antiblackness is the privileged perspective
from which to understand racial formation more broadly. But unlike the
way feminist and queer critical theory interrogate heteropatriarchy from
a subjectless standpoint, [Sexton's]{.underline} entire
[point]{.underline} [seems]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
[rest]{.underline} [on]{.underline} the very specificity and
**[singularity]{.underline}**---[rather than]{.underline}
**[subjectlessness]{.underline}**---[of black **critical**]{.underline}
[theory's]{.underline} **[capacity]{.underline}** [to understand
**race**]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} **[privilege]{.underline}** [of
[this]{.mark}]{.underline} embodied [[viewpoint]{.underline}]{.mark}
similarly [[relies on]{.mark} rigidly **[binaristic]{.mark}**
[conceptions]{.mark} [of]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[land]{.underline}]{.mark} [and]{.underline}
[[bodily]{.underline}]{.mark} [[integrity]{.underline}]{.mark}. He
writes, "If the indigenous relation to land precedes and exceeds any
regime of property, then the slave's inhabitation of the earth precedes
and exceeds any prior relation to land---landlessness. And selflessness
is the correlate. No ground for identity, no ground to stand (on)."57 In
other words, the slave's nonrelation to her body precedes and exceeds
any other body's relation to land. However, the [**settler colonial**
designation of the United States]{.underline} and Canada as terra
nullius---[as **legally** **empty**]{.underline}
[lands]{.underline}---**[denies]{.underline}** the very [corporeality of
Indigenous populations]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
[inhabit]{.underline} [land]{.underline}, [much]{.underline}
[less]{.underline} **[have]{.underline}** any [**rights** to
it]{.underline}. Alongside genocidal elimination, the
[**[erasure]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} [Indigenous]{.mark}
corporeal]{.underline} [[existence]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} [[inseparable]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[from]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[ground]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[it]{.underline}** doesn't stand on, or [is removed from]{.underline}.
For the same reason that the economic reductionism of orthodox Marxism
has been discredited, such [[an **argument** that
**frames**]{.underline}]{.mark} [racial]{.underline}
[[slavery]{.underline} [as]{.underline} [a **base**
for]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[[colonial
superstructure]{.underline}]{.mark}** similarly [[**fails** to take into
account]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[dialectics]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[settler colonial capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. The political economy
of settler colonial capitalism is more appropriately figured as an
ecology of power relations than a linear chain of events. Relinquishing
any conceptual privilege that might be attributed to Indigeneity,
alternatively, Coulthard offers a useful anti-exceptionalist stance:
["[the]{.underline} [**colonial** **relation**]{.underline}
[should]{.underline}]{.mark} [not [be]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[**understood** as]{.mark} a]{.underline} primary locus of
'[[**base**']{.underline}]{.mark} [from which]{.underline} these
[**other** forms of **oppression** **flow**]{.underline},
[but]{.underline} [rather]{.underline} [as]{.underline}
[[the]{.underline} [**inherited** background]{.underline}]{.mark}
[field]{.underline} [[within which market, racist, patriarchal, and
state relations converge]{.mark}."]{.underline}58 From this view,
[[race]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and]{.mark} **[colonialism]{.mark}**
[form]{.mark} the **[matrix]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
**[settler colonial]{.mark}** [racial]{.mark}
**[state]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Putting colonial land and enslaved labor at the center of a dialectical
analysis, we can see that blackness is neither reducible to Indigenous
land nor Indigeneity to enslaved labor. Indigenous peoples and slaves
are not reducible to each other because settler colonialism abides by a
dual logic that is originally driven to eliminate Native peoples from
land and mix the land with enslaved black labor. If land is the basis of
settler colonialists' relationship to Indigenous peoples, it is labor
that frames that relationship with enslaved peoples. We can draw on
Patrick Wolfe's important points about the heterogeneous racial effects
of such a settler formation based on Indigenous land and enslaved labor.
To summarize those points, the racial content of Indigenous peoples is
the mirror opposite of blackness. From the beginning, an eliminatory
project was driven to reduce Native populations through genocidal wars
and later through statistical elimination through blood quantum and
assimilationist policies. For slaves, an opposite logic of exclusion was
driven to increase, not eliminate, the population of slaves. [[One
**logic** does not **cause** the other]{.underline}]{.mark};
[rather]{.underline}, [[they **work together**]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} **[serve]{.underline}**]{.mark} a unitary end in
[increasing **[white settler property]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} the form of **[land]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} an
[**enslaved labor** force]{.underline}. [As a result]{.underline},
[in]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[postemancipation]{.underline}**,
postfrontier [era]{.underline}, [the racial content of Indigenous
peoples is entirely]{.underline} dissolvable and
**[eradicable]{.underline}**. [Alternatively]{.underline}, the [racial
content of **blackness** remains **absolute**]{.underline} and
essential, and [maintains an **infinite** capacity to
**contaminate**]{.underline}. As Wolfe states, "the [respective
racializations]{.underline} . . . [were **diametrically**]{.underline}
**[opposed]{.underline}**, in a manner that reflected and preserved the
foundational distinction between land and labor. [For]{.underline}
[whereas]{.underline} [race for black people became an **indelible
trait**]{.underline} that would survive any amount of admixture,
[race]{.underline} for ~~Indians~~ [became an inherently **descending**
quantity]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [was]{.underline} terminally
[susceptible to **dilution**]{.underline}."59 One consequence is that
the phrase "separate but equal" can take two meanings: as either an
injurious legal relic or a sovereign politics of the future.60 Given
this stark distinction in racial ontologies, [[any]{.underline}]{.mark}
critical [[theory]{.underline}]{.mark} [[that]{.mark} [views]{.mark}
**[race]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **[colonialism]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[as]{.underline}]{.mark} a [**[causal]{.underline}**
[rather]{.underline} [than]{.underline}
**[dialectical]{.underline}**]{.mark} relation [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**[incapable]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[exposing]{.underline}]{.mark} these **[[inextricable]{.mark}

### Perm -- King

#### The critique pits Black and Indigenous studies against each other- the perm does presume any specific form of relationality but bands together to resist structures of domination and oppression

[The relationship]{.underline} [between]{.underline} [**Native**
**genocide**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[anti-Blackness]{.underline}** [has been **articulated**]{.underline}
sometimes [in terms]{.underline} [of presumed
**solidarity**]{.underline} or comparison, such as the notion that
[Native peoples **harbored** runaway **slaves**]{.underline} and that
[Black fugitives **assisted** Native peoples in **armed**]{.underline}
**[struggle]{.underline}** [against]{.underline} settler
[encroachment]{.underline}. [Sometimes]{.underline} it has been
[articulated]{.underline} [in terms of **antagonism**]{.underline}, such
as the focus on [Native peoples who]{.underline} [**owned**
slaves]{.underline} and on [enslaved]{.underline} or indentured [Black
people who participated]{.underline} in settler [raids]{.underline} on
Native nations. Nowadays, [it seems to be in terms of
incommensurability,]{.underline} which asserts a lack of
commonality/relationality between Black and Native folks. This project
emerges from us thinking that **[all of these modes are
insufficient]{.underline}**. While certainly solidarity, antagonism, and
incommensurability are distinct and no one mode of relationality can be
presumed, at the same time [it is **illogical** to presume we can talk
about **any**]{.underline} mode [without]{.underline} doing it [in
**relationship** with **one** **another**]{.underline}. If we submit
momentarily to the popular position that Black and Native peoples and,
by extension, [Black and Native]{.underline} politics are at an impasse
represented by their incommensurability, then the flip side of being
stuck together---or [this]{.underline}
**[stuckness]{.underline}**---[is]{.underline} already [a form of
**relationality**]{.underline}. As a result, we think Édouard Glissant's
"relation" seems to be a helpful starting point: Relation . . . does not
act upon prime elements that are separable or reducible. If this were
true, it would itself be reduced to some mechanics capable of being
taken apart or reproduced. It does not precede itself in its action and
presupposes no a priori. It is the boundless effort of the world, to
become realized in its totality, that is to evade rest. One does not
first enter Relation, as one might enter a religion. One does not first
conceive of it the way we have expected to conceive of Being. It seems
that [much **analysis** of the **relationship** between]{.underline}
Indigenous genocide/[**settler** **colonialism**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [**anti**-**Blackness**]{.underline}
[tends]{.underline} [to be **prescriptive**]{.underline} [in that the
analysis]{.underline} [presumes]{.underline} a certain [prescribed
politic]{.underline}---whether it be a call for solidarity in a certain
way or a call to reject solidarity. But [**analysis** of]{.underline}
[relationality]{.underline} [suggests]{.underline} something
otherwise---that the **[relationality]{.underline}**
[between]{.underline} [genocide]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[anti]{.underline}**-**[Blackness]{.underline}** [is not]{.underline}
fixed and [easily **knowable**]{.underline}. In addition, to borrow from
Antonio Viego's Dead Subjects, there is an [imperative in the
academy]{.underline} [to make]{.underline} [Native peoples
knowable]{.underline} and [to]{.underline} [presume]{.underline} that
[**Black peoples** are **already** **known**]{.underline}.2 Thus, not
surprisingly, the relationship between the two is presumed to be fully
representable and it keeps Black and Indigenous communities in isolation
from one another, which is a settler desire/ dream. Thus, we would
prefer an approach that [does not]{.underline} [presume]{.underline}
[an]{.underline} "[answer]{.underline}" but [instead]{.underline}
[seeks]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [ask]{.underline}
[questions]{.underline} about the [complexities]{.underline} [of this
relation]{.underline}, and [hence]{.underline} the political
[possibilities]{.underline} that emerge from asking these questions and
engaging in the process of relation. [This desire not to
presume]{.underline} an answer [mediates any attempt to trace a
genealogy to this conversation with the respective fields of Native
studies and Black studies]{.underline} because to tell a story of either
field tends to prescribe the outcome of any conversation between the
fields. For instance, we could trace the development of Native studies
through the influential work of Elizabeth Cook-Lynn's "Who Stole Native
Studies" and Winona Stevenson's "'Ethnic' Assimilates 'Indigenous.'"3
These works argued that Native studies should distance itself from
ethnic studies (and presumably from Black studies by extension) because
otherwise the field of ethnic studies would relegate Native peoples to a
racial minority status rather than as peoples seeking decolonization.
Cook-Lynn and Wheeler contended that engaging Native studies with ethnic
studies, postcolonial studies, and so on, which do not share a concern
for the liberation of Native peoples, could have the effect of
domesticating Native studies into a multiculturalist project of
representation within the academy instead of one that defended Native
nations' claims to sovereignty. While there is much to be gained by
tracing the genealogy of Native studies through these works, how does
this genealogy presume that Black studies (or ethnic studies generally
speaking) is fundamentally about articulating a racial minority status?
Or we could center the work of Lee Maracle and Roberto Mendoza who
argued that Native people and Native studies needed to be in
conversation with radical political thought emerging from all sectors of
society.4 Such a genealogy would more easily enable a conversation
between Native studies and other fields of thought. At the same time,
their work often presumed a more Marxist framework as the point of
conversation between Native studies and other fields. Thus, we wonder
what might be enabled differently from a conversation that began from
dif­ferent theoretical assumptions? The point here is not to disparage
the importance of these works. Rather, it is to say that to delimit the
fields of Native studies and Black studies is to delimit the
possibilities of conversations between the two. And to have this
conversation is to simultaneously open up what the fields of Native
studies and Black studies can be. Similarly, mapping genealogies of
Black studies might also work to stifle emergent, lesser known, and
otherwise conversations between the two fields. For one, the task of
periodizing the field and charting its geographic coordinates is already
a contested project. Further, attending to how multiple forms and
practices of Black study have turned their scholarly attention to
Indigenous peoples might privilege some forms of knowledge production
and their political projects over others. The aforementioned project
requires a project of its own. For example, Arika Easley-Houser examines
antebellum African American print culture (newspapers, political
speeches, David Walker's Appeal) in order to track the ways African
American writers thought and talked about Native Americans in the
nineteenth century.5 Easley-Houser argues that several dif­ferent
political projects, ranging from ones that sought alliances with Native
peoples to comparative projects that tried to prove African American
superiority to Native peoples and even investigations of Native
practices of enslavement, motivated Black nineteenthcentury writing on
Native peoples.6 Shortly after founding the Association for the Study of
African American Life and History in 1915, Carter G. Woodson authored
the article "The Relations of Negroes and Indians in Massachusetts" in
1920 in the Journal of Negro History. Throughout the twentieth century
there were intermittent attempts on the part of Black individuals and
institutions to document and study Black and Native histories and
exchanges in America. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, militant
anti-imperialist and anticapitalist activism animated by the Black Power
movement in the US and Third World internationalism birthed the first
Black studies programs. The strong ties between Black activism and the
development of academic departments created fertile ground for
conversations between Black and Native scholars and activists.
[Revisiting Black, Native, and ethnic studies' radical roots encourages
a commemoration of histories of solidarity and shared struggle while it
also exposes the pressure that universities put on fields like Black
studies to "define" itself and distinguish itself from other ethnic
studies programs like Native studies]{.underline}. In 1974, Robert Allen
wrote about the ways that [Black studies and ethnic studies were
b]{.underline}eing "[counter-posed" and forced into an "antagonistic
relationship" with one another in the academy.]{.underline}7 While this
genealogical approach thus far has limited itself to Black studies in
the US, [recounting this history helps expose the ways that the settler
colonial university worked (and continues) to pit fields like Black and
Native studies against one another and prevent generative
dialogue]{.underline}.8
