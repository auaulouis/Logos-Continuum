[Decades of neoliberalism have produced deep dissatisfaction with the
state of the world and a consequent yearning for something
better.]{.underline} Millions of [people live paycheck to paycheck,
struggling to meet their basic needs, and economic insecurity has not
abated despite promises that if people work hard and do their
best,]{.underline} they'll climb their way up the socioeconomic ladder.
The [failures of neoliberalism]{.underline} as [a policy project---a
shrinking middle class, the usurpation of worker power at the hands of
shareholders and executives, and intensifying economic
precarity]{.underline}---are well documented (Konczal, Milani, and Evans
2020; Hathaway 2020). [Liberals and progressives in politics, academia,
and outside social movements have demonstrated how neoliberal policies
like deregulation, slashed taxes, and privatization have undermined
democracy, frayed social safety nets, produced staggering economic
inequality,]{.underline} and---contrary to promises about unleashing the
"magic of the market"---led to falling economic growth rates (Gamble and
Banerji 2017; Almeida and Martín 2022; Hopkin 2020; Mitchell and
Holmberg 2023). Other [work has shown that neoliberalism has, from the
outset, been a racialized project---with particularly harsh consequences
for communities of color]{.underline} (Strickland and Wong 2021;
Goldberg 2008; Hamilton 2019).

But considerably less attention has been paid to the damage of
neoliberalism as a cultural project.2 As political theorist Wendy Brown
explains, ["neoliberalism . . . has not only produced new inequalities,
but new insecurities through the precarity of work and
life"]{.underline} (Brown 2017, emphasis added). Rampant rhetoric
[endorsing individualism, competition, and personal choice have
cultivated feelings of personal inadequacy and shame as people strive,
but so often fail, to make ends meet and get ahead.]{.underline} The
result has been [increased psychological distress, disconnection and
isolation, and social atomization]{.underline} (Parramore 2022).

At the psychological level, [neoliberalism produces and reinforces the
same tendencies underpinning liberal individualism: an emphasis on
personal growth, fulfillment, and affect management for
self-regulation]{.underline} (Becker, Hartwich, and Haslam 2021). The
i[deology holds that pursuit of these ideals will lead to human
flourishing and happiness]{.underline} (Adams et al. 2019; Becker,
Hartwich, and Haslam 2021). But because [the philosophy of neoliberalism
maintains that homo neoliberalus, or the "neoliberal self," is an
entrepreneurial subject, personal growth and fulfillment are said to be
attained through competition with others]{.underline} (Scharff 2016;
Becker, Hartwich, and Haslam

1 The desire for a more satisfying life is, of course, not unique to our
present moment in time. But we believe that the acute mismatch---between
this longing for an alternative way of being and the everyday reality of
contemporary life---is what makes this moment in time relatively novel,
and the need for a strong progressive response particularly urgent.

2 [Our main focus in this report is on mass culture, rather than elite
political culture, though it is worth noting that the latter has also
suffered significant negative consequences]{.underline} in the era of
neoliberalism's ascendancy. In particular, [neoliberal elite political
culture tends to embrace an ostensibly "values-neutral" approach to
policymaking, wherein policymakers are only taken seriously if they
speak in the language of economics, without taking other values and
priorities into account---for example, equality, fairness, or
universalism]{.underline} (Popp Berman 2022).

The Cultural Contradictions of Neoliberalism

2021). [This positioning of interpersonal competition as a
key]{.underline} ingredient for personal growth and fulfillment can
[diminish well-being because it places sole responsibility for success
on individuals, while reducing broadening solidarities that might act as
buffers against failure]{.underline} (Teo 2018; Adams et al. 2019;
Becker, Hartwich, and Haslam 2021; Scharff 2016). As Rustin (2014) has
commented on the self-destructive [elements of neoliberal ideology and
practice, "\[w\]here relational needs are unmet, and respect and
recognition to people are denied, human capacities will be
undermined.]{.underline} The [anxieties arising from failures of
dependency and trust will impact both on the most obvious 'failures' in
competitive environments, but also on those who appear
successful."]{.underline}

Relatedly, [neoliberalism's emphasis on the
individual]{.underline}---and in its purest form, repudiation of the
broader, collective society---[can undermine strong social ties and a
sense of community, both of which are critical to maintaining mental
health, combating mental disorders, and even promoting physical
health]{.underline} (Zeira 2022; Martino, Pegg,

and Frates 2017). We can see our social ties weakening in the
decades-long downward trend in attachment to institutions, like church,
unions, and workplaces, that once helped foster social connections
(Jones 2019; Feiveson 2023). Throughout different areas of life,
Americans' sense of belonging---defined as a subjective feeling that an
individual is an important part of their surrounding systems, from
friends and family, to work environments, school, and community, to
cultural groups and physical spaces (Hagerty et al. 1992)---is generally
low. For example, 64 percent of Americans report non-belonging3 in the
workplace, 74 percent report non-belonging in their local community, and
68 percent report non-belonging in the nation (Argo and Sheikh 2023). A
lower but still unsettling percentage of Americans report non-belonging
in more intimate circles, among families (40 percent) and friends (44
percent) (Argo and Sheikh 2023). [These figures are worrisome, as it is
well established that belonging is a basic human need that all people
seek to satisfy]{.underline} (Allen et al. 2021; Maslow 1954; Baumeister
and Leary 1995; Deci and Ryan 2009).

#### Learning anti‑capitalism transforms your knowing--- it reshapes epistemology from within.

As we\'ve [learned through culturally responsive teaching, dependent
learners, students who were barred from developing the intellectual
capacity for higher-order thinking, are often the folks who were
historically objectified and who continue to be diminished and
marginalized through a lack of agency]{.underline} in the school
setting. They are [purposefully unsupported in reaching
self-actualization, maintaining a cycle of fragmentation and alienation.
This is essentially what capitalism does- it reduces everything,
including human labour, into private property that can be exploited to
accumulate capital. Through capitalism, the oppressed are instilled with
values that condone and idolize the oppressor.]{.underline} Friere
argues that [we must transform this consciousness within ourselves and
our students to incite radical change within our society.]{.underline}
Shifting from [viewing students as objects to viewing students as
subjects and partners in dialogue can transform the learning
experience. \]{.underline}
\
Establishing learning partnerships is foundational to both culturally
[responsive teaching and anti-capitalist education. It requires
relationships based on mutual care and respect, with the teacher as
co-learner and ally.]{.underline} Freire notes that when engaging in
dialogue, [\"the teacher is no longer merely the-one-who-teaches, but
one who is himself taught in dialogue with the students, who in turn
while being taught also teach. They become jointly responsible for a
process in which all grow\"]{.underline} (Frieire, 1968). Essentially,
collectivism and student agency are required in liberating students\'
minds. Students need affirmation that they are capable of greatness-
acknowledging that what are perceived as \"failures\"\' result from
systemic inequalities that limit their potential. We must affirm that
these obstacles can be surmounted and even dismantled through hope and
collaboration. This affirmation is exemplified through hooks\' work, as
she aims to diffuse hierarchy and create a sense of community within the
learning environment. Hooks maintains that the classroom should be a
life-sustaining and mind-expanding place, a liberatory space and
partnership. 

### 2NC\-\--FW\-\--State Policy Reps Bad

#### Policymaking in the state is bad--- it conceals power beneath the surface of regulation.

**Scheffler and Walter '24** (Gabriel, is a professor at the University
of Miami School of Law, Daniel E.,is an associate professor of law at
the Texas A&M University School of Law.,"Revealing the Submerged
Administrative State", The Regulatory Review,

// mika

Why is the federal government so unpopular?

For many Americans, the answer to this question appears
self-evident---[the government is unpopular simply because it does a bad
job.]{.underline} As law professor Peter Schuck writes, ["across many
different policy domains, the public perceives poor governmental
performance -- and generally speaking, the public is correct in this
view."]{.underline} Another prominent perspective focuses on ideological
movements, primarily (though not exclusively) on the political right,
[that for decades have worked to sow distrust in government through
anti-government rhetoric and actions designed to undermine government's
effectiveness.]{.underline}

Although there is some truth to both of these perspectives, they do not
tell the whole story. Another major factor is that even when the
government is effective in providing benefits or addressing social
problems, few Americans understand its achievements. For instance,
consider President Joseph R. Biden's signature legislation, the
Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which delivers historic investments in
combatting climate change, curbs prescription drug prices, and expands
subsidies to obtain health insurance. These are undeniably important
achievements. Yet public opinion surveys have consistently shown that
most Americans have no idea what this law does or how it will benefit
them.

Nor is this an isolated incident. For years, polling found a lack of
awareness of President Barack Obama's signature legislation, the 2010
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), which represented the
largest expansion in health insurance coverage since the enactment of
Medicaid and Medicare and drove America's uninsured rate to historic
lows. It was only when Republicans came close to repealing the ACA in
2017 that enough public support emerged to save the law---barely.

Government also succeeds in other quotidian yet important ways, ranging
from protecting Americans from airline and traffic accidents to ensuring
clean air to funding the infrastructure and investments that enable the
local weather report. Yet most of us tend to take these achievements for
granted or to overlook them entirely.

Why are more Americans not aware of the ways that government succeeds?
And why does the government not do more to make the public aware of its
successes?

As we argue in a recent article in the Wisconsin Law Review, an
important part of the explanation is that Americans are not tuned into
where most of the work of government is being done: the collection of
agencies known as the "administrative state." The administrative state
comprises the agencies that deliver or oversee public benefits and
services---for example, the Postal Service, the Social Security
Administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services---and the
agencies that regulate industry to promote safety, health, and
welfare---such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the
Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Federal Trade Commission.

Although the administrative state's role in implementing laws and
government programs is well known to policy insiders, we argue that the
critical work that federal agencies do is submerged---to borrow a term
coined by political scientist Suzanne Mettler. [That is to say, it is
hidden from public view, making it difficult for Americans to perceive
it or to understand its day-to-day effects on their lives. Despite
agencies' responsibility for the vast bulk of government
work]{.underline} (including implementing statutes such as the IRA and
the ACA), it is extremely difficult for even the most informed Americans
to appreciate the extent to which agency actions affect their lives. As
a result, Americans tend to underestimate the extent to which they
benefit from government programs either because they do not recognize
that they are receiving these benefits or because they are not aware
that the benefits are being provided by the government. It is partly
because of this submergence that the political response to several key
U.S. Supreme Court's recent decisions constraining the administrative
state has been so muted, despite the danger that these decisions will
ultimately render government less effective.

### 2NC\-\--AT: Perm\-\--Burnout

#### Activists get burnt out from movements, many times leading them to leave their activism.

Global Justice Initiative, George Mason University & Associate Professor

The [interviews yielded several hundreds of pages of transcribed text
that encompassed a [wide]{.mark} [range]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[issues]{.mark} [related]{.mark} [to]{.mark} activism, [activist]{.mark}
[burnout]{.mark}, and self-care (or the lack of it) among
activists.]{.underline} As the data were analysed, we suspected that we
would find [demographic differences in how participants experienced the
symptoms, causes, and implications of their burnout.]{.underline} We
imagined, for example, that low-income participants might have reported
causes of burnout that differed from those of their wealthier
counterparts, or that distinctions might be evident in the implications
of burnout when we looked across the issues around which participants
were basing their activism. Perhaps counter-intuitively, only one such
distinction emerged: several participants of colour mentioned how racism
within SJHR movements and organizations hastened their burnout---an
issue discussed in more detail below. Notably, participants were not
asked specifically about their perceptions of these differences---any
line of questioning that would appear as fishing for particular kinds of
responses was avoided. Aside from the issue of racism that
[[participants]{.mark} [reported]{.mark} [within]{.mark} [their]{.mark}
[movements]{.mark}]{.underline}, the lack of attention to demographic
comparisons reflects, not a lack of curiosity about possible
distinctions, but a lack of evidence in the data that such distinctions
existed in the data collected and analysed. [[Among]{.mark} 22
[participants]{.mark}, [all]{.mark} [had]{.mark} [experienced]{.mark}
some level of [burnout]{.mark}, [left]{.mark} their [activism]{.mark},
and eventually adopted strategies to address their burnout, allowing
them finally to be able to re-engage in their activism.]{.underline}
Many participants also referred to burnout in the larger SJHR
communities and organizations with which they identified. Jill shared,
for example: 'when I started in the mid- to late '90s, it was so rampant
\... Almost [[everyone I knew was dealing with some element of
\[burnout\] and it was affecting their]{.mark} physical [health]{.mark}
or their emotional health or their work was really

### 2NC\-\--L\-\--Logistics

#### Governments need war to stimulate the global war economy, giving private companies extremely profitable cycles of re-investment through logistical military infrastructure, weapons trade, etc.

Itself"; Truthout; 4/24/2022;

The Russian invasion --- brutal, reckless and condemnable by any
standard --- has sparked debate on NATO's proposed expansion into
Ukraine and the role that it played in motivating the Kremlin. U.S.
officials were keenly aware, in fact, that the drive to expand NATO to
Russian borders would eventually push Moscow into a military conflict.
"[We examine a wide range of nonviolent measures that could exploit
Russia's actual vulnerabilities]{.underline} and anxieties as a way of
stressing Russia's military and economy and the regime's political
standing at home and abroad," notes a 2019 study by the RAND
Corporation, a Pentagon-affiliated think tank. "[The steps we examine
would not have either defense or deterrence as their prime
purpose]{.underline}," it states, but rather, "these steps are conceived
of as elements in a campaign designed to unbalance the adversary,
leading Russia to compete in domains or regions where the United States
has a competitive advantage, and causing Russia to overextend itself
militarily or economically."

But the provocation could not be reduced to geopolitical competition,
however important, as most observers were keen to do. Missing from the
larger picture was the centrality of militarized accumulation --- of
endless low- and high-intensity warfare, simmering conflicts, civil
strife and policing --- to the global political economy. Militarized
accumulation refers to a situation in which a [[global war economy
relies on the state to organize war-making]{.mark}, social control [and
repression to sustain capital accumulation]{.mark} in the face of
chronic stagnation and saturation of global markets.]{.underline} These
state-organized practices are outsourced to transnational corporate
capital, involving the fusion of private accumulation with state
militarization in order to sustain the process of capital accumulation.
Cycles of destruction and reconstruction provide ongoing outlets for
over-accumulated capital; that is, these [cycles [open up new
profit-making opportunities for]{.mark} transnational
[capitalists]{.mark} seeking ongoing opportunities [to]{.mark}
profitably [reinvest the enormous amounts of cash they]{.mark} have
[accumulated]{.mark}.]{.underline} There is a convergence in this
process of global capitalism's political need for social control and
repression in the face of mounting popular discontent worldwide and its
economic need to perpetuate accumulation in the face of stagnation.

**[[Wars provide critical economic stimulus.]{.underline}]{.mark}** They
have historically pulled the capitalist system out of accumulation
crises while they serve to deflect attention from political tensions and
problems of legitimacy. It took World War II to finally lift world
capitalism out of the Great Depression. The Cold War legitimated a half
century of expanding military budgets and the Iraq/Afghanistan wars, the
longest in history, helped keep the economy sputtering along in the face
of chronic stagnation in the first two decades of the century. From the
anti-Communist fervor of the Cold War, to the "war on terror," then the
so-called New Cold War, and now the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the
transnational elite, led by Washington, have had to conjure up one enemy
after another to legitimate militarized accumulation and deflect crises
of state legitimacy and capitalist hegemony onto external enemies and
contrived threats.

The events of [[September 11]{.mark}, 2001, [marked the start of]{.mark}
an era of [a permanent global war in which logistics]{.mark}, warfare,
intelligence, [repression, surveillance]{.mark} and even military
personnel [are]{.mark} more and more [the privatized domain of
transnational capital.]{.mark}]{.underline} The Pentagon budget
increased 91 percent in real terms between 1998 and 2011, while
worldwide, total state military budget outlays grew by 50 percent from
2006 to 2015, from \$1.4 trillion to more than \$2 trillion. (This
figure does not take into account the hundreds of billions of dollars
spent on intelligence; contingency operations; policing; bogus wars
against immigrants, terrorism and drugs; and "homeland security.")
During this time, military-industrial complex profits quadrupled.

However, focusing just on state military budgets only gives us a part of
the picture of the global war economy. As I showed in my 2020 book, *The
Global Police State*, the various wars, conflicts and campaigns of
social control and repression around the world involve the fusion of
private accumulation with state militarization. In this relationship,
[[the state facilitates the expansion of opportunities for private
capital to accumulate through militarization]{.underline}]{.mark}, such
as by facilitating global weapons sales by military-industrial-security
firms, the amounts of which have reached unprecedented levels. Global
weapons sales by the top 100 weapons manufacturers and military service
companies increased by 38 percent between 2002 and 2016 and can be
expected to escalate further in the face of a prolonged war in Ukraine.

COVID-19, A NEW BLACKMAIL BY IMPERIALISM TO SMASH THE CLASS STRUGGLE AND
PEOPLE\'S WARS

In the 1960s, Chruschtschow argued in relation to the nuclear issue and
the way he dealt with his US colleague J. Kennedy: \"[We (the US and the
USSR) are the most powerful countries in the world; [if we unite in the
name of peace, there will be no war]{.mark}. So if some madman wants
war, all we have to do is threaten him with our fingers and he will calm
down.]{.underline}

\"What good are principles to him if he loses his head? (Pravda, 1963)

[[With such statements the Soviet]{.mark} revisionism of Chruschtschow
and his clique [tried to argue their]{.mark} nefarious thesis of
\"[peaceful coexistence\" with US imperialism]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
other words, in the face of the so-called danger of a Third World War,
revisionism [proposed a ceasefire with US imperialism, and apparently
part of this commitment determined that the USSR would renounce
proletarian internationalism]{.underline}, support popular revolutions
and national liberation, under the pretext of not committing any actions
that might eventually provoke the US. And not only that, it is time to
recall how Chruschtschow\'s revisionism vehemently attacked Chairman
Mao\'s China for supporting the people\'s revolutions and national
liberation that took place in Asia, which in his view was an
irresponsible act and threatened world peace.

In other words, the [[history of nuclear war by the imperialist social
revisionism]{.mark} of the USSR [became a vicious]{.mark} [blackmail for
the oppressed peoples]{.mark} of the world to refrain [from their
revolutionary processes and in them from class
struggle.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The [blackmail of the nuclear war should devour the class
struggle!]{.underline}

Today, [[imperialism of all colours]{.mark}: the [USA]{.mark}, China,
[Russia]{.mark}, Germany, France, etc., its [puppets in the]{.mark}
countries of the [Third World]{.mark}]{.underline}, and in them the
revisionists, are once again releasing this green Khrushchev puke of
reconciliation, of [\"[peaceful coexistence]{.mark}\", using the
pandemic as a Trojan horse.]{.underline}

This new version of nuclear blackmail, which is shown in the \"Unity
against COVID-19\", tries in a certain way to put us in the \"same
pigeonhole\" of the 1960s, where the struggle of the communists in the
world and its different forms, [as it manifests itself in different
countries (people\'s war; bloody, non-bloody class struggle), tries or
pretends to be subordinated to an apparent main contradiction, which
appears in the \"struggle of humanity\" against the
pandemic.]{.underline}

Today, the health emergency caused by the same imperialism, be it
Yankee, Chinese or Russian, has shown even more vehemently how weak
imperialism is inside, a real paper tiger; able to develop nuclear
weapons; able to travel outside the planet; able to attack any country
in any part of the world, but unable to withstand a crisis within its
borders, which, as in the case of the USA, is already more than 80 years
old. 000 dead, which is 15 percent of the US soldiers killed in the
Second World War; more than the number of victims that the imperialists
suffered in the Vietnam War (53,000); more than those who died in Korea
(33,000); far more than those who joyfully left blood on Iraqi soil
(5,000 dead); and an unstoppable increase in the number of those
infected (about one million people), which will certainly double the
number of dead in the coming weeks.

But [even under these conditions, [imperialism cries out for \"unity\",
for \"peace\", which is repeated in all]{.mark} the [countries]{.mark}
subjected to the different [manifestations of imperialism in the
world]{.mark}]{.underline}; but the same powers are still in violent
struggle in the Middle East: Syria, Iraq, Iran; also in Afghanistan,
Yemen and Palestine, which [[increases]{.mark} the [suffering]{.mark} of
the peoples exposed to the worst misery and destruction.]{.underline}

They are [not remaining inactive in America militarily either. It was
precisely in those days that they attempted an armed invasion of
Venezuela from Colombia.]{.underline}

[[Imperialism and its lackeys are calling us to unity]{.mark} in the
same way as in 1963, using the same tactics: \"One is trickery in the
style of the priest and the other is repression in the style of the
executioner. The [deceptive peace policy of imperialism and]{.mark} its
[war policy]{.mark} have [always served]{.mark} and complemented [each
other]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Is it appropriate in this and any other context to declare a ceasefire
in the middle of the development of the people\'s war in the countries
where it is waged by the communist parties?

Is it convenient to fall for the lure of throwing the governments and
old states at the proletariat and other exploited masses with euphemisms
of unity, of a cease-fire with \"party, ideological or group interests\"
in order to witness the crisis caused by the pandemic?

No! Impossible!

Now it is important to remember how, in the development of the People\'s
War in Nepal, and especially before the attack on Dunai in February
2001, the Second National Conference of the CPN-M was held in India,
where the GP\'s betrayal began to be forged, since from this \"event\" a
cease-fire was accepted by the government. As an act of \"good will\",
the CPN-M handed over the prisoners of war to the regime, and
\"tactical\" actions resulted from these events and this conference,
which demanded a ceasefire and negotiations. Not much time passed, and
the \" Prachanda Way \" took root in the party leadership and led them
to the abyss of history, of surrender. The people\'s war was betrayed in
a horrible way.

In other words, it only took a moment, a certain scenario, and the
revolutionary forces, through their traitors, revisionism and
opportunism, gave the initiative to the enemy. The rest is practically
only a matter of time.

Between revolution and counterrevolution, between the oppressed
countries and the oppressing countries, between the bourgeoisie and the
proletariat, between the masses and the feudal system, there can be no
peace, not even a conditional one. The pandemic does not justify leaving
the initiative to the class enemy, the enemy of the people and the
state; it must not be given a break. The old state is shaken, it is
weak, and that is when we must bring about its downfall, as Mao taught
us in the Six Military Writings. [We must not allow the old power, since
its bankruptcy, to try to show itself as generous,
\"humanitarian\";]{.underline} that it has, above all, the opportunity
to sell the idea that the State does not belong to a certain class but
to the people, and thus to revive Khrushchev\'s old theses, which are so
timely, [in order to maintain the entrenched discourse which calls for
unity in order to face the health crisis in Ecuador and the
world]{.underline}.In any case, the pandemic is raging among the
weakest, the most miserable, the poor, the outcasts, the landless, those
who are not only alienated from receiving decent hospital care; those
who live from one day to the next and who are now forcibly confined
without the old states being able to satisfy their most basic needs of
daily life.

There can be no peace with the old states and their governments if they
place all the responsibility, the social, health and economic crisis on
the shoulders of the workers, as is happening right now in Ecuador.

There can be [no peace with the apparatuses of repression because they
serve the interests of the old state.]{.underline} This is evident in
such elementary things as the violent reaction against our people, who
have been physically, psychologically and even in their dignity attacked
by these wretched guardians of the old power.

There can be no peace in Colombia if paramilitarism, supported by the
armed forces and the old state as a whole, continues to assassinate
peasant leaders in Cauca, Putumayo and other departments. And we must
bear in mind that those with a high death rate are precisely
peasant/indigenous leaders who are at the forefront of the struggle to
defend the country and who have had enough of armed revisionism and
paramilitary/state violence to a large extent. But armed revisionism
also \"takes its toll\", which, without going beyond its ideological
diatribe typical of the principles and laws that dominate revisionism,
has led to a peace process fed by permanent ceasefires at Christmas,
[[ceasefires for the exchange of prisoners]{.mark}, for the New Year,
for Easter, for the floods, \"humanitarian\" ceasefires and so on, a
series of pauses under every pretext that finally gave the reaction the
total initiative]{.underline}. The sum of the small truces turned into a
capitulation that, like an avalanche, took everything, the lives of poor
peasants, of fighters, of demobilized people, who in the end were used
by their leadership to get where opportunism and revisionism always end:
in the parliament, in the National Assembly or in any political dignity
of the old state.

There can be no cease-fire in countries where [the class, the poor
peasantry and the masses have developed a people\'s war under the
pretext that these, the masses, should be provided with healthy
supplies, when we know that such supplies, if they come at
all]{.underline}, are inappropriate and inadequate and are obviously
being instrumentalised to undermine the support base that the people\'s
war has within the poor peasantry.

The recent experiences of comrades in the Philippines in relation to the
unilateral ceasefire announced between April this year speak volumes.
The enemy took advantage of the ceasefire because of the pandemic and
carried out 36 attacks on the NPA, in which 18 comrades were killed and
8 injured. Although it is true that the timely reaction of the People\'s
Army inflicted 56 casualties on the enemy, the facts themselves show
that [[imperialism]{.mark} and the old states are [always trying to
reach ceasefire agreements]{.mark}, basically [with the intention of
destroying the rev]{.mark}olution]{.underline}, be it by annihilating
the living forces, such as destroying bases or influencing their
political and ideological line in order to draw them into political
annihilation.Lenin rightly pointed out the attitude that we
revolutionaries should take in case of pandemics and the impossibility
of abandoning the struggle against the class enemy, because it is
obvious that they are behind this world crisis, that it was caused by
them, by the enemies of the class and the people.

We must do exactly what Chairman Mao did in 1963 when Chruschtschow
tried to blackmail the countries of the Third World with talk of nuclear
weapons and the Third World War; expose them, fight them; denounce their
error, their lie, their strategy. To fight and resist and to persevere
in the class struggle, in the people\'s war, but also in the two-line
struggle among the peoples; to ignore this situation, not to understand
it, will lead to defeats for the international proletariat.

The people\'s war has made great leaps in Turkey, the Philippines, India
and Peru. If we fall into the blackmail of COVID-19, cracks will remain
open which will certainly make the people\'s war vulnerable, because
what is won is easily handed over to the enemy and yes, contrary to what
was said in 1963 in the publication of Pravda in support of
Khrushchev\'s theses, the principles tell us to lose our heads, because
this is the way it has always been throughout history, because this is
the way the Paris Commune, the revolution in Russia, in China, the
people\'s wars fought in the world by the communists, who are convinced
of their principles and who have shown us the right way, if the New
Democratic Revolution, socialism and communism are really in our
program.

We cannot and must not declare a ceasefire in the people\'s war or in
the class struggle because of a fundamental fact: We do not yet have
power in our hands, and that is indeed the greatest and most solid
argument.

Today there is no wind coming from the East to rule over that of the
West; today there is an unstoppable hurricane rising from the bowels of
the countries of the Third World and that there is no nuclear war, no
military aggression, no reaction, no pandemic and no social or natural
phenomenon ,which can stop it.

No to ceasefires; no to alliances; no to negotiations; yes to popular
war up to communism.

No to the medicine men, because [the [imperialist oppression of the
semi-colonies does not stop]{.mark}, it does not stop for a single
minute; [because cap]{.mark}italism [is predatory]{.mark}, intransigent
[and exploitative towards the workers]{.mark}; because the big
landowners bleed the poor peasants second by second, minute by minute;
because revisionism and opportunism do not lose a moment to sink their
poisonous arrows in the destruction of the revolutionary achievements of
the proletariat and its strategic allies.]{.underline}

No to the ceasefire in the class struggle in the countries where the war
is waged without bloodshed; no to class reconciliation; yes to open,
determined confrontation, to that which, even out of the struggle for
the rights, contributes to the rapid and necessary development of the
people\'s war.

No to passive struggle; no to dialogue; yes to active, revolutionary
struggle, otherwise we will not be what we are.

LONG LIVE THE PEOPLE\'S WAR IN PERU, IN THE PHILIPPINES, IN TURKEY AND
IN INDIA!

NO TO CEASEFIRE WITH THE ENEMY OF THE CLASS, OF THE POOR PEASANTRY AND
OF THE PEOPLE!

NO TO CLASS RECONCILIATION ON THE PRETEXT OF THE FIGHT AGAINST THE COVID
19 PANDEMIC!

IF WE DON\'T FIGHT REVISIONISM, WE HAVEN\'T DONE ANYTHING!

### 2NC\-\--L\-\--Mining

#### Mining is capitalist

**Graulau 19**, Jeannette Graulau got her doctorate from Syracuse
university, and currently a professor of Political Economy, expert on
mining and capitalism, author of 'Silver Mining on a Global Scale'.
("Mining and the Rise of Capitalism", Yalo University Press,
https://yalebooks.yale.edu/2019/12/02/mining-and-the-rise-of-capitalism/)//LASA-MB

From David Landes's Prometheus Unbound to Giovanni Arrighi's Origins of
Our Times, scholars continue to quarrel over one of the most difficult
questions of all time: the why, how, and where of the origins of
capitalism. Some return to the inexhaustible argument of England's
Industrial Revolution. Others, demystifying this story, go for more
audacious formulations like the "5,000 years of world system" à la
Gunder Frank.

However, [to look for mining's role in "unbounding Prometheus" or the
origins of our times is similar to looking for a needle in a
haystack---this, despite the fact that medieval [mining was the industry
that]{.mark} produced silver, the "oil that [moved the wheels of the
global economy]{.mark}."]{.underline} Mining pioneered responses to "the
old classical devil of diminishing returns" centuries before David
Ricardo debated the matter. [Mining [created credit instruments]{.mark}
[that were pivotal to the ascent of modern banking]{.mark} in Western
Europe. Above all, [mining]{.mark} vigorously adapted and responded to
what later [became one of the most urgent problems]{.mark} of capitalist
industry[: how to increase labor productivity]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Traditional]{.mark} political [econ]{.mark}omy is [to blame
for]{.mark} the [lack of studies]{.mark} about mining]{.underline}. It
surrendered any inquiry on the subject to Adam Smith's heuristic device
of "the butcher, the brewer and the baker." It ignored that Smith was
recalcitrantly against Spanish mercantilism, and so had no other option
but to argue that [mining was "the most disadvantageous lottery in the
world]{.underline}." Marxist political economy is to blame, too, for
placing mining outside the history of capitalism. Staunchly convinced
that mining was the realm of "proto-capitalism," as Marx argued,
Marxists insist that mines were exploited by powerful surplus-extracting
lords. Unlike the advanced stage reached by agrarian labor, mining labor
remained confined within a "feudal mode of production" and constrained
by the cycles of nature. Much of the debate stemming from these ideas
has thus become redundant and parochial, [as it is grossly incapable of
engaging with new evidence that sheds light upon mining's role in the
rise of capitalism.]{.underline}

[The medieval mining [industry was unlike any other productive
activity]{.mark}. "Piercing mountains with tunnels"]{.underline};
sinking shafts at depths that could reach 300 feet; timbering mine
walls, adits, and galleries; transporting ores and inputs; renting
beasts of burden; [paying land surveyors, foremen, and expert miners;
and building waterwheels and ore-smelting factories; all these were
costly stages of production.]{.underline} Above all, solving the problem
of fondinae aquaticae or shaft flooding required money. Money came not
from lords' rents, but from a new economic agent of the medieval world:
[the shareholding mining corporation.]{.underline}

Holding sixteen partii or shares in the case of Alpine companies, and up
to thirty-two trente or shares in Sardinia, medieval mining corporations
were advanced private businesses. Organized hierarchically, the medieval
mining corporation had secretaries, accountants, chief engineers,
experts in mine geometry, cashiers, and financial officers. [Wherever it
flourished, [it established rules for leasing, selling, mortgaging,
donating]{.mark}, and inheriting mining shares---all at the expense of
lords.]{.underline} More importantly, [[corp]{.mark}oration[s]{.mark}
[were dominated by]{.mark} powerful groups of [private citizens]{.mark}
who paid the costs [and]{.mark} [enjoyed profits from]{.mark} the
[exploitation of]{.mark} the underground wealth of
[nations]{.mark}.]{.underline} An unprecedented economic change was
triggered by the progress of the medieval mining corporation. The
underground wealth of nations was an economic reality in the making,
[forging capitalist relations long before the rise of modern capitalism.
[Exploitation of mines]{.mark} [depended]{.mark} not [upon]{.mark} "the
regularity of natural phenomena," as political economy thinkers argued,
but upon [mining corp]{.mark}oration[s]{.mark}. The latter [hastened the
dissolution]{.mark} of feudal lordly power [by driving
capitalist]{.mark} [change]{.mark} in mining lands.]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--L\-\--Climate Change Disaster

#### **Climate disaster solutions are a new form of commodification**

**Fletcher 12**-- (Robert, \" Capitalizing on chaos: Climate change and
disaster capitalism\*'', Ephemera, May 1^st^, 2012, VOL.12)//ggao

[themselves commodified as a source of further profit through enclosure
and sale within neoliberal markets. Hence, Castree (2008) describes such
activities as providing a series of 'environmental fixes' for
capitalism's central contradiction in pursuit of new sources of income
to combat falling rates of profit, including: [1) commodifying and
trading new forms of 'natural capital'; 2) replacing state control of
resources with capitalist markets; 3) intensifying exploitation of a
given natural resource to yield increased short-term profits; and 4)
transferring resource governance responsibility (and thus revenues) from
states to non-state actors.]{.mark} In this sense, neoliberalization of
natural resources can be seen as part and parcel of the strategy of
'accumulation by dispossession']{.underline} that Harvey (2005) finds
characteristic of neoliberalism in general, in terms of which [[wealth
is generated less through creating wholly new sources of value than by
appropriating resources formerly controlled by others or held in the
public domain for the enrichment of a minority
elite.]{.underline}]{.mark} Addressing climate change (which the Stern
Review (2006) famously pronounced the world's greatest externality)
through creation of carbon markets has been described in just this
manner by Bumbus and Liverman (2008). Yet, the majority of the
neoliberal nature literature describes attempts to create markets for
the sustainable use of natural resources. [Climate change response
stands somewhat distinct from this, however, in that its aim is, on the
contrary, to encourage resources' non-use, by, for instance, leaving
forests intact and fossil fuel in the ground to avoid the release of
greenhouse effectinducing carbon into the atmosphere.]{.underline} In
this respect, climate change response is best considered as an aspect
not of neoliberal natural resource management generally but of
neoliberal conservation in particular. As researchers increasingly
observe, the global effort to preserve natural resources from extraction
and use has itself become progressively neoliberalized over the past
several decades (e.g., Sullivan, 2006, 2009, forthcoming; Igoe and
Brockington, 2007; Brockington et al., 2008; Brockington, 2009;
Brockington and Duffy, 2010b; Büscher, 2010; Fletcher, 2010a), and this
practice requires distinct mechanisms for attempting to harness the
value of resources in situ (Büscher et al., 2012), as I describe further
below.

### 2NC\-\--L\-\--Fission

#### **Fission fuels Capitalism, not Climate Change**

**Murray** ,Graduate Program Director of (MPPGA) program, **25**--
(Peter, \"Nuclear is Not the Solution: The Folly of Atomic Power in the
Age of Climate Change'' , FSP, March 2025,
https://socialism.com/fso-article/review-nuclear-is-not-the-solution-the-folly-of-atomic-power-in-the-age-of-climate-change/)//ggao

[That, of course, goes to the inevitable tendency of [capitalism]{.mark}
to use the environment as simply a mine and a sewer --- [the underlying
reason for climate change in the first place.]{.mark} It also goes to
why Dutton has precisely zero to say about the disposal of nuclear
waste.]{.underline}

Nuclear energy has something of a mystique, born, it seems, of the
secrecy surrounding it. Nuclear incidents attract headlines. [And [there
is a tendency to elevate nuclear energy as a special case.]{.mark} But
this misses a crucial point. [Under capitalism, with its need for profit
and never-ending growth, no industry is safe.]{.mark} Safety requires
accountability and community control, rather than the opacity and
impunity of corporate bureaucracies, both private and
state-run.]{.underline}

Chapter two is particularly pertinent to the Dutton "plan." It
demonstrates that nuclear energy --- anywhere in the world --- is simply
too costly in terms of both economic resources and time to be of any
benefit in combatting the effects of climate change. Ramana
comprehensively demolishes all of the rationalisations put forward in
support of nuclear power generation. Originally impossible without
government support and subsidies, it is now infeasible even with that
assistance. Older facilities were effectively "war surplus," that is,
direct by-products of the so-called "nuclear arms race." They were thus
cheap and prone to failure, and inevitably malfunctioned. Public
pressure meant that the technology had to be modified. And therein lies
the problem: "modern" nuclear plants became incredibly costly and,
increasingly, indefinitely delayed. Very bad for business! So guess who
pays? Taxpayers -- that is, the working people!

Ramana's work is an essential text for anyone grappling with the sheer
illogic of the Dutton scheme. [There is something of a consensus in the
environment movement that it is [aimed at derailing the transition to
renewable energy]{.mark}. But is it? That is certainly a plausible
suggestion. [But capitalism is not like a car,]{.mark} which can stop in
its own length and change course on command.]{.underline} I was recently
at the "People's Blockade" of the giant Newcastle coal port, which
services vast bulk freight vessels. This year, the blockade had a
success! One ship was actually forced to turn around. But the action is
usually symbolic, because the giant ships can't turn and can't stop in
any reasonable distance. Too much energy has been invested in getting
the vessel to move at all for it to easily alter course.

[Ramana makes the telling point that the nuclear energy sector and the
so-called "military-industrial complex" [cannot be treated as separate
entities.]{.mark} The intervention of the nuclear sector into the
climate change emergency is simply about retaining the industry as a
source of weapons materials. Perhaps not in this or that particular
country, but as an [essential component]{.mark} of the global system of
arms production --- which is by far the [most profitable segment of the
global capitalist economy]{.mark}.]{.underline}

It's a telling insight, and one that has merit, in my opinion. [For this
country, [Dutton's intended outcome is]{.mark} almost certainly [not to
alleviate the energy crisis]{.mark} flowing from the demise of fossil
fuel generation. That ship has sailed (pun intended!).]{.underline}

[It's about [ensuring that the U.S. has uninterrupted access]{.mark} to
uranium as raw material for its worldwide killing machine.]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--L\-\--Militarization

#### Militarization in the Arctic is aimed to achieve capitalist goals

**Bonds '16** \[Eric; January 13; Assistant professor of sociology at
the University of Mary Washington specializing in environment,
militarism, and human rights topics; "Losing the Arctic: the U.S.
corporate community, the national-security state, and climate change,"
https://doi.org/10.1080/23251042.2015.1131600\]

Giddens' (2009) argued that more international collaboration between
nations is necessary to reduce global carbon emissions, but he also
warns that climate change will create new situations -- like the melting
of Arctic sea ice -- that could create new divisions and new hostilities
between states. It seems that both the U.S. government and analysts at
elite think tanks understand these dynamics as they call for the
increasing U.S. participation in diplomatic efforts in regard to the
Arctic, such as acceding to the United Nations Law of the Sea. At the
same time, they are also [[calling for]{.mark} the development of
[a]{.mark} more [permanent military force]{.mark} in the
region]{.underline}, for instance by increasing military training
exercises in the region and developing Arctic bases, along with the
development of a fleet of nuclear-powered icebreakers on par with
Russia. Both analysts from [the corporate community and [the
U.S.]{.mark} government [believe that this]{.mark} two-pronged effort
[will create]{.mark} the kind of [security]{.mark} and stability that
corporations will need [in order to take advantage of Arctic resources
and]{.mark} to eventually increase transoceanic [shipping]{.mark} across
Arctic waters.]{.underline} But, just as the corporate community is
calling for an expansion of the military into the Arctic, the [U.S.
government has developed a strategy to promote increased business
activity]{.underline} in the region, which is well-captured by the
following quote from the Navy's (2014, 16) Arctic Roadmap: The Navy will
support access for the safe, secure, and free flow of resources and
commerce in the Region. [[Strategic resources and trade routes will be
a]{.mark} [primary driver for]{.mark} Arctic and non-Arctic
[nations]{.mark} alike to seek economic prosperity.]{.underline} The
Navy will contribute to stability and security as economic activity
increases. The U.S. government has, up to this point, avoided the kind
of aggressive military posturing in the Arctic advocated for by the
Heritage Foundation. It has, to the contrary, adopted a more cooperative
approach and an emphasis on the resolution of disputes through diplomacy
and international law that many members of the corporate community
believe will be more conducive to economic growth. So, while other
research has produced evidence that the treadmills of production and
destruction are distinct logics, the findings here suggest that [[the
two are not always]{.mark} as [disentangled]{.mark} as commonly
described. In order to understand the potential overlap between
capitalism and militarism]{.underline}, I utilized a power-structure
research approach to identify goals and strategies developed within both
the U.S. corporate community and the U.S. government. If found that,
though there were important exceptions, the approaches taken by the
corporate community and the government largely mirrored each other. The
corporate community was calling for, and [planning on, stronger U.S.
diplomatic efforts along with an increasing military presence in the
region.]{.underline} The U.S. government was largely calling for the
same course of action, [while also planning to facilitate increasing
economic activity in the region in terms of natural resource extraction
and shipping.]{.underline} Though these findings need to be further
evaluated and subjected to more research, they indicate that there is a
codependence between the corporate community and the U.S. government.
More generally, [these findings indicate that while both [militarism and
capitalism]{.mark} are two different logics to power, they [are
potentially **complementary**]{.mark}.]{.underline} While scholars
should be attuned to contradictions between these logics and the ways
they might undermine one another -- for instance in regard to the U.S.
experiences in Vietnam and Iraq -- it may also open new areas of study
for environmental sociologists to assess the extent to which capitalists
and military elites rely on the fulfillment of each others' goals,
despite the environmental consequences. Certainly, [[in regard to the
Arctic, capitalism and militarism are encompassing a new region]{.mark}
on the Earth.]{.underline} Both the treadmill of production and
destruction models anticipate that the consequences will be severe.

generates a multitude of intricate relationships, where militarism

capitalist activity continues to seek new markets and forms of
production, in concomitant fashion, policies of human dispossession,
dislocation, and destruction inevitably are normalized. In the United
States, for example, [[state]{.mark} and private enterprises
[approach]{.mark} these twined forces of [expansion]{.mark} and
destruction [with the **false yet clichéd** appeal of spreading the
"greater goods" of capitalism]{.mark} and democracy through the War on
Terror.]{.underline} That is, deeper conjunctions of militarism and
capitalism make the line between them increasingly indistinct and call
for radical interventions to expose the military-industrial complex's
inner workings and impacts on the quality of human life and on the
viability of societies across the globe. The editors of this issue and
the scholars whose work appears on its pages seek to demonstrate the
critical need to understand capitalist projects and military aggression
by illuminating their deep entanglements.

For each of us, the lethal combination of militarism and capitalism is
an issue of world-historical importance made increasingly dire as their
conjunctions become ever tighter within economies of permanent violence.
The image on the cover of this issue tells this story. It captures a
mural that greets visitors at the entrance of the Daechuri Art and Peace
Village in Pyeongtaek, South Korea, just outside of US Army Garrison
Humphreys. In 2001, [when the US Department of Defense (DOD) announced
plans to expand the army base, Daechuri villagers launched a protracted
struggle to save their homes and communities from
destruction.]{.underline} They held candlelit vigils, squatted in
evicted buildings, confronted the riot police, and demonstrated outside
the base gates. The protests sparked international attention and drew
antimilitary activists from South Korea and throughout the world. In May
2006, 11,500 South Korean police officers and troops descended on
Daechuri and violently ended the uprising, using clubs and water cannons
to disperse the protesters. Although the South Korean government
destroyed the original Daechuri village, the local residents erected the
Art and Peace Village in its place to preserve the memory of the
struggle with photography exhibits, sculptures, and other art-making
projects. Next to the mural at the village's entrance, a wooden sign
announces in Korean and English that this is "a war and brutality free
zone."1

The Daechuri Art and Peace Village stands as a potent reminder of the
people's resistance against the US military, which becomes all the more
urgent as the evicted and the dispossessed are being transformed into
dependents of Camp Humphreys's growing economy. Camp Humphreys, the US
DOD's "crown jewel of overseas installations," occupies 14.7 million
square meters of South Korea's rural landscape.2 When its expansion is
set to complete in 2020, Camp Humphreys will be the largest US military
base in the world. It will house more than forty-five thousand residents
and include such amenities as an eighteen-hole golf course, a
supermarket, a movie theater, a "super gym," and a 300,000-square-foot
shopping center. One army official called it "our little piece of
America."3 On and surrounding the base, the US Army has created its own
economy modeled on US suburban communities, similar to the little pieces
of Americana on the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base or on Kwajalein Island
that cater to US military personnel and their families.4 These spaces of
leisure require the constant displacement of local people and their
incorporation into the new militarized economy. [In Pyeongtaek, [Camp
Humphreys's economy is built partly on the ruins of the]{.mark} original
[Daechuri Village;]{.mark} it [exists because rice fields and farming
villages were **expropriated**]{.mark} from the people who lived there
[and their labor was absorbed]{.mark} into making the military town
function.]{.underline} This seems to be, in effect, primitive
accumulation in action, even in the era of late capitalism. Though the
villagers were already enmeshed in capitalist circuits of production and
consumption, they nevertheless found themselves forced off their lands
and their means of production, thereby restructuring the local economy
entirely. And if the economies surrounding other US military bases in
South Korea (or, indeed, the whole world) offer us a window into the
future, we can foresee such economic dependence on Camp Humphreys
becoming normalized or even desired by people who survive off of or
profit from the base. [[Transforming land-based agricultural workers
into workers on behalf of a war economy led by an imperial, foreign
nation extends the original violence of expropriation into a lasting
structure]{.mark} of the Daechuri villagers' everyday
existence.]{.underline}

colonialism, and climate change in Hawai'i. She details the economic,
cosmological, and physical violence that Kanaka Maoli, the original
people of Hawai'i, [have confronted as [they have struggled against the
capitalist development that requires the ongoing illegal seizures of
their lands]{.mark}---from the establishment of the first sugar
plantations and military bases to more recent suburban housing
complexes.]{.underline} Yet mobilizations of labor and resources on
behalf of industrial developments also have created the contexts for
Kanaka Maoli and their allies to defeat technologies of extraction and
colonial violence on her home island of O'ahu. Her essay weaves together
the array of problems and potential sites of resistance that the
convergence of militarism and capitalism generate, including climate
change, the propagation of gun violence, and transnational alliances of
indigenous people against the resource extraction that threatens water
and life. In particular, the food sovereignty movement that Niheu has
engaged with for more than two decades has revitalized ancient farming
techniques, a process that has depended on nonviolent direct action to
reclaim water rights and to take back the lands stolen by the US
government. The lessons of nonviolent direction action, she argues, were
passed down from an earlier generation of activists who helped birth the
Hawaiian Renaissance in the 1970s. [Niheu ends her essay with a powerful
call to build transborder alliances across the globe among peoples who
similarly struggle against militarism, colonialism, and state violence
and to [recognize one's own complicity in that
violence]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Geoengineering]{.underline}---specifically stratospheric aerosol
injection---is [not only risky, but supports powerful economic
interests]{.underline}, protects an [inherently ecologically harmful
social formation]{.underline}, relegates the fundamental
social-structural changes needed to address climate change, and is
rooted in a [vision of a nature as a set of passive resources that can
be fully controlled in line with the demands of capital]{.underline}.
The case for geoengineering is incomprehensible without analyzing the
social context that gave birth to it: [[capitalism's]{.mark} inability
to overcome a contradiction between the [need to accumulate
capital]{.mark}]{.underline}, on the one hand, [[and]{.mark} the [need
to maintain a stable climate system on the other]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Substantial emissions reductions, unlike geoengineering, are costly,
rely more on social-structural than technical changes, and are at odds
with the current social order. Because of this, geoengineering will
increasingly be considered a core response to climate change. In light
of Herbert Marcuse's critical theory, [the [promotion of geoengineering
as]{.mark} a market-friendly and [high-tech]{.mark} strategy [is shown
to reflect]{.mark} a [society that can]{.mark}no[t]{.mark} [set
substantive aims]{.mark} through reason and transforms what should be
considered means (technology and economic production) into ends
themselves]{.underline}. Such a condition echoes the first-generation
Frankfurt School's central thesis: instrumental rationality remains
irrational.

1\. Introduction

"\[A\]dvanced industrial society is ... the latest stage in the
realization of a specific historical project---namely, the experience,
transformation, and organization of nature as the mere stuff of
domination. ... In the medium of technology, culture, politics, and the
economy merge into an omnipresent system which swallows up or repulses
all alternatives."

---Herbert Marcuse \[1\] (p. xvi)

On the one hand, the puzzle of geoengineering, climate engineering, or
"climate intervention"---"the deliberate large-scale intervention in the
Earth's climate system, in order to moderate global warming" \[2\] (p.
ix)---entails a series of seemingly purely technical questions
concerning effectiveness, affordability, timeliness, and safety. For
instance, while the Royal Society's \[2\] influential assessment of
geoengineering methods addressed substantive questions of ethics and
governance---in a rather brief, abstract, and problematic way
\[3\]---the criteria for assessing proposed strategies were based solely
on seemingly purely technical criteria (i.e., effectiveness,
affordability, timeliness, and safety). In a systematic analysis of
geoengineering appraisals, Bellamy et al. \[4\] found that all
appraisals framed the problem in narrow, mostly technical terms and most
commonly as an issue of climate change emergency conditions,
insufficient mitigation efforts, or climate change impacts. In a recent
report on "albedo modification" (see "Solar Radiation Management" in
Section 3), the U.S. National Research Council \[5\] (p. 186) were clear
that "\[a\]ny future decisions surrounding the use of albedo
modification will need to be based on more than just scientific
theories" and must address "social, ethical, political, and legal
discussions" along with technical considerations.

While we address the serious potential risks of geoengineering, we also
ask, in the spirit of a form of rationality capable of addressing both
means and ends, why geoengineering is offered as a climate change
solution: What structural forces and forms of rationality have driven
the recent agenda for geoengineering? The "whys" are not as
straightforward as expert-analytic appraisals suggest. In the
aforementioned study, the "obvious exclusions" [in the context frames
included a wealth of social and ethical issues \[4\] (p. 605). However,
recent analyses of geoengineering have asked substantive questions about
geoengineering: its social, legal, political, and ethical
dimensions]{.underline} (e.g.,
\[3,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26\]).

We adopt a method of "ideology critique," which, in social-ecological
context, entails "immanent critique" (explained shortly), historicizing
seemingly natural and immutable social conditions, and diagnosing
socio-ecological contradictions and crises \[27\]. Horkheimer \[28\] (p.
173) summarized immanent critique as "apprais\[ing\] society by the
light of the very ideas that it recognizes as its highest values" with
an awareness "that these ideas reflect the taints of reality" (see also
\[29\]). In the context of geoengineering, to paraphrase Horkheimer, we
appraise geoengineering "by the light of the very ideas that it
recognizes as its highest values" with awareness that geoengineering
strategies reflect a social formation that probably cannot overcome a
contradiction between the need to accumulate capital, on the one hand,
and the need to maintain a stable climate system on the other (see
Section 4.1). Because reasons to support geoengineering are primarily
technical and means-based, our assessment is akin to the post-Second
World War ideas of the first-generation Frankfurt School, in which
immanent critique took the form of a critique of instrumental reason as
"unreason" \[30\]. Our examination has much in common with Clive
Hamilton's \[31\] (p. 53) argument that "what matters ethically about
geoengineering is not only the outcome but also the human disposition it
reveals" (see also \[32,33\]). By attending to both the
social-structural conditions that gave birth to the geoengineering
agenda and the forms of rationality used to legitimate it, we diagnose
what geoengineering means for human rationality in capitalist society
and the chance for social alternatives. Our central contribution is
bringing together sociological questions concerning the relationship
between social structure and patterns of thinking with substantive
questions regarding the desirability of geoengineering.

We draw on the early Frankfurt School's theorization of technology to
examine which structural forces and forms of rationality have driven the
recent agenda for geoengineering in advanced capitalist societies. We
focus particularly on the work of Herbert Marcuse for a perspective that
is neither technophobic nor naively Promethean. Although too easily cast
aside as deterministic, gloomy, and monolithic, the epigraph, written
over five decades ago in Marcuse's most celebrated and infamous work,
foretells the story of geoengineering. It presupposes the necessary
categories and causal frameworks for understanding why putting giant
mirrors into space or intentionally manufacturing large-scale algal
blooms are beginning to be considered less utopian means to address
climate change than reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Like
Feenberg (e.g., \[34,35\]), we see Marcuse's theory as one possessing
both a critical conception of the social and environmental implications
of technology as well as a potential solution to the destructive
consequences of technical achievements (see Section 2.2).

In the following, we review environmental social-scientific, STS, and
ethical work on geoengineering, focusing on what is known about
conceptualizations used to frame geoengineering (Section 2.1), and then
integrate Marcuse's writings on technology and abridge Feenberg's
explication (Section 2.2). Following an overview of stratospheric
aerosol injection and its risks (Section 3), we [examine how a Marcusian
perspective can explain the structural forces and forms of rationality
that have driven the [recent agenda for geoengineering in advanced
capitalist societies]{.mark}]{.underline} (Section 4). In the
conclusion, we predict that geoengineering will increasing be considered
a leading strategy to combat climate change, and that the prospect of
the deployment of potentially catastrophic geoengineering strategies
substantiates the first-generation Frankfurt School's bleakest
assessments of instrumental rationality (Section 5).

2\. The Social Dimensions of Geoengineering: Revisiting Marcuse

2.1. A Review of the Social Dimensions of Geoengineering: What the
Frankfurt School Can Offer

A growing number of environmental social scientists, STS scholars,
environmental ethicists, and others have developed nuanced positions
concerning the social, political, legal, and ethical dimensions of
geoengineering, including evaluations of geoengineering based on its
unanticipated harms and inherent wrongness, and investigating options
for geoengineering governance and the issue of consent (e.g.,
\[3,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,31,33\]).
Social scientific research has given special attention to public
perceptions of geoengineering \[16,36,37,38,39\] and, especially
relevant to this project, media and expert framings of geoengineering
\[4,11,40,41,42,43,44\].

In an analysis of newspaper articles (cf. \[43,44\]), and lending
support to the argument that technological rationality underpins the
geoengineering agenda (see Section 4.2), Nerlich and Jespal \[40\] found
that various metaphors used to frame geoengineering "can all be related
to one conceptual master metaphor or master frame according to which the
earth is a machine or cybernetic system (car, heating system, computer)
that is broken but can be fix" \[40\] (p. 141). Two other
"master-metaphors" employed to [frame geoengineering included the planet
as (1) a body and as (2) a patient/addict]{.underline}. We return to
dominant media framings of geoengineering in Section 4.2, arguing that
many framings of geoengineering are [constituted by a form]{.underline}
of [[thinking that reduces the universe]{.mark} to a mass storehouse of
goods and services that can be easily, successfully, and [wholly
dominated for human aims]{.mark}]{.underline} (technological
rationality).

In an analysis of assessments of geoengineering (cf. \[42\]), two
dominant frames were identified: (1) geoengineering as a response to
"insufficient mitigation" (reducing GHG emissions will not be enough to
address climate change) and (2) geoengineering as a response to a
"climatic emergency" \[41\] (see also \[4\]). Both of these frames are
regularly invoked to make the case for geoengineering as "Plan B,"
"\[t\]he dominant narrative surrounding geoengineering" \[37\] (p. 945),
or, that geoengineering research should be conducted now because
geoengineering may be necessary in a climatic emergency following
insufficient GHG emissions reductions. Similarly, Sikka \[11\]
critically analyzed discursive frames and strategies employed by those
associated with pro-geoengineering think tanks. In addition to several
forms of an "exceptionalism" frame, the other frame discussed by Sikka
lends support to arguments more fully discussed in Section 4.1:
geoengineering proponents commonly justify geoengineering proposals
through appeals to the market.

Muraca and Neuber \[45\] advanced social-scientific and substantive
examinations of geoengineering by evaluating geoengineering
strategies---including stratospheric aerosol injection (discussed
below)---from the perspective of criteria related to the social and
intellectual movement of "degrowth". Emerging as a political slogan in
France and quickly developing into an "activist-led science" \[46\],
degrowth refers to "socially sustainable and equitable reduction of
society's throughput" \[47\] (p. 59) (for review, see \[48\]).
Afforestation under certain conditions may be the only geoengineering
strategy compatible with a degrowth perspective, one developed from a
normative operationalization of Georgescu-Roegen's \[49\] concept of
"viable" technology and Illich's \[50\] concept of a "convivial" tool.
In agreement with the argument presented in Section 4.1, Muraca and
Neuber \[45\] begin with the case that growth-dependent economies are
unsustainable in the long-run. They develop a unique rendition of the
"moral hazard" case against geoengineering \[51\] from a degrowth
perspective: in a growth-dependent society, geoengineering deployment
will create trade-offs with mitigation efforts, thereby delaying the
transition to an ecological society (see also \[52\]).

We further elevate analyses of the social dimensions of geoengineering
by examining structural forces and forms of rationality that have driven
the recent agenda for geoengineering. Despite the merits of the research
discussed above, no analysis to date has sought to explain both the
social-structural conditions that gave birth to the geoengineering
agenda and the forms of rationality adopted to legitimate it. In
relation to research on the framing of geoengineering, "forms of
rationality" can be thought of as the underlying reasons why "some
aspects of a perceived reality" are made "more salient" \[53\] (p. 52).
According to the Frankfurt School, modern societies are characterized by
the prevalence of a "subjective," "formal," or "instrumental"
rationality, or "the ability to calculate probabilities and thereby to
co-ordinate the right means with a given end" \[28\] (p. 5).
Paradoxically, the instrumentalization of reason purges moral and
aesthetic reflection from rationality, making rational judgment on the
rightness of the "given end" impossible. We argue that the case for
geoengineering is founded on two mutually reinforcing forms of
instrumentality: economic and technological rationality. To be clear,
our argument is not that economic and technological justifications for
geoengineering are the only justifications, though, as shown in the
literature above, economic and technological justifications are dominant
modes of legitimation in the geoengineering agenda. We focus on economic
and technological legitimations of geoengineering because we think these
will register as the most valid and relevant justifications in
policy-making and appeal to (a historically contingent) "commonsense".
We make the case that the prominence, validity, and relevance of these
arguments can only be understood in a particular and contradictory
social context.

A second contribution of this project is connecting the forms of
rationality justifying geoengineering to social-structural conditions.
Attending to both social structure and political economy, on the one
hand, and reasons-giving, framing, and other ideational variables, on
the other, is important in the context of geoengineering. For example,
we agree that geoengineering proponents have "focused on a single
operational criterion (market efficiency, the economy) at the expense of
all others" \[11\] (p. 172) (see Section 4.1) and that the earth is
conceptualized as a giant machine-like entity in discussions of
geoengineering \[40\] (see Section 4.2), but the social-structural
context that makes these lines of argumentation and conceptualization
central to geoengineering proponents should be made explicit.

In the next subsection, we explain why Marcuse's theory of technology is
well-positioned to accomplish these tasks. In an article concerning
geoengineering governance that draws from Feenberg's critical theory of
technology (see Section 2.2), Sikka \[12\] (p. 113) hinted at what a
Marcusian analysis of geoengineering can bring to the literature:
"geoengineering can be seen as a dehumanizing and dangerous kind of
technology created solely as a potential technical means for mitigating
climate change without sacrificing our existing way of life". This
article significantly expands on the latter claim through a critical
examination of the structural forces and forms of rationality that have
driven forward the recent agenda for geoengineering.

2.2. The Critical Theory of Technology

Before discussing Marcuse's theorization of technology and its relation
to nature, it is helpful to contextualize these insights in his
overarching critical theory of advanced capitalism and the project of
critical theory itself. Critical theory requires a distinction between
two interrelated dimensions: "appearance" (sometimes "existence" or
"actuality") and "essence" (sometimes "potentiality") (\[54,55\], \[56\]
pp. 224ff). In Marcuse, "appearance" signifies the established
social-economic and political order and ossified social relations formed
in the past that are thrust upon living individuals as experienced in
the matter-of-fact world we find ourselves in everyday life, whereas
"essence" signifies what is possible or potential in the current order's
level of development, presently inhibited---yet attainable in modified
conditions---hopes, needs, aims, and longings of humans, social
movements to rationally alter the established order, as well as the
underlying total social process that shapes the social order. There is a
"tension between potentiality \[essence\] and actuality \[appearance\],
between what men and things could be \[essence\] and what they are in
fact \[appearance\]" \[54\] (p. 69). The purpose of critical theory is
to bring these antagonisms to consciousness via analysis and assessment
with the goal of helping more rational historical possibilities become
existent---or to at least explain what restricts social alternatives.

Marcuse's analysis of monopoly-consumer capitalism detailed how human
longings, desires, and instincts are repressed and sublimated into
alienated work \[57\] and how [advances in information and communication
technologies, embedded in consumer capitalism, make possible [new forms
of social control]{.mark}]{.underline} \[1\] (for summary, see \[58\],
pp. 136f). The most pernicious development in advanced industrial
society is the manufacturing and satisfaction of "false needs," forming
the widespread illusory impression that the hopes and desires of humans
are already realized via mass consumption. Humans are manipulated, in
part by interaction with various forms of technology, into affirmatively
accepting "the way things are". By "flattening out" the tension between
"the given \[appearance\] and the possible \[essence\]," some capitalist
technological artifacts help to conceal underlying contradictions, i.e.,
function as ideology \[1\] (p. 8). To oversimplify Marcuse's assessment
of "one-dimensionality": consumer society and its techniques allow for a
smoother reproduction of the expansion of the accumulation process by
fashioning automotive-like passive consumer-workers who believe
"non-conformity" to be "socially useless" \[1\] (p. 2). Marcuse's
critique of advanced capitalism, coupled with the backdrop of the
Frankfurt School's philosophy of history (discussed next), is the
context in which he fashions his theory of technology.

The Frankfurt School argued that the historical project of using reason
to dominate nature and free humanity from nature's supremacy, a project
rooted in antiquity but taking full form in the modern era, had
paradoxically enslaved human beings along with the rest of nature
\[59,60\]. What is considered progress in Western civilization "runs in
a single strand, on the rails of the mere domination of nature" \[61\]
(p. 212), an instrumental rationality "reproduced" in society and the
self. With the proliferation of an instrumental reason incapable of
formulating substantively rational ends, the development and spread of
[capitalism, and unreflective technical progress]{.underline}, reason
has lost its aim (the emancipation of human beings). Marcuse's central
contribution to the Frankfurt School's [domination of nature thesis was
his analysis and critique of modern technology]{.underline}. Marcuse
\[62\] (pp. 138--139) conceptualized technology broadly, as the totality
of late capitalist social organization, artifacts
(instruments/machinery), as well as the modern mode of instrumental
thinking. Technology is mediated by society and vice versa. Technical
achievements reinforce and alter the way in which domination takes place
in social relations and between society and nature, and the interests
and values of society are embodied in technical achievements. This
process also influences how the interests and values of society are
embodied in technical achievements and even individual technical
artifacts: "the machine, the instrument, does not exist outside an
ensemble, a technological totality; it exists only as an element of
technicity," whereby, "domination is transferred to machines and
directed against nature" \[63\] (pp. 123, 127).

[[Technology transforms nature into]{.mark} a [mech]{.mark}anical and
infinitely malleable order [for]{.mark} the [aims of
capital]{.mark}.]{.underline} This transformation of reality into a
"calculable order" is underpinned by a "technological rationality," a
"pure" instrumentality incapable of formulating substantive end goals
\[1\] (p. 158), \[63\]. If modern science and technology, as embedded
social projects, have transformed the world into a world of means, they,
by definition, depend on ends. However, devoid of substantive goals that
cannot be rationally formulated---instrumental reason is not concerned
with the quality of ends, only with the effectiveness of means---ends
are instead formulated by the "pregiven empirical reality" \[64\] (p.
152), or, "in line with the prevalent interests in the respective
society" \[65\] (p. 44). Science and technology are not independent,
neutral forces, but are organized in capitalist societies---their
pregiven reality---to serve the interests of capital \[66\].

No one has done more to explicate and update Marcuse's critical account
of technology than Feenberg \[34,35,67,68,69\]. Feenberg stressed two
contributions of Marcuse that are especially important for this project:
(1) identifying how a supposedly neutral technology "incorporates"
social values and interests and (2) explaining how a supposedly neutral
and formal technological rationality serves to reproduce an exploitative
social order. We discuss both contributions in turn.

Drawing from Marcuse, Feenberg's critical theory of technology holds
that technology is value-laden, as opposed to value-neutral \[68\]. In
particular, Marcuse \[1,70\] argued many technologies are fastened to
the interests of capital. Economic rationality and its central goal of
profit-maximization often shape the design and implementation of
technology. Techniques and machines are used to dominate the external
world due to the "presence" of ruling interests "in" them, determining
"their number, their life span, their power, their place in life, and
the need for them" \[71\] (p. 12). Translating Marcuse's argument into
STS lexicon: "design embodies only a subset of the values circulating in
society at any given time" and capitalism is unique in that the range of
possible value-mediations of technology are reduced due to
"conflict\[s\] with a narrow pecuniary interest" \[35\] (p. 105). In
short, embedded in a society of organized domination, technology is
often utilized to further the domination of nature and humans:
"\[t\]echnology is always a historical-social project: in it is
projected what a society and its ruling interests intend to do with men
and things" \[72\] (pp. 223--224).

Regarding Marcuse's notion of technological rationality as explicated in
Feenberg's critical theory of technology, technological reason is said
to be repressive and ideological because it is unable to identify social
alternatives in the existing order. Exemplifying one-dimensional
thinking, modern technological rationality only "aims at classification,
quantification, and control," declares that the "empirically observed
thing is the only reality" (i.e., cannot detect alternative social
futures within the present) \[35\] (p. 87), and sees nature as "stuff of
control and organization" \[1\] (p. 153). Because technological
rationality is incapable of identifying social alternatives to an
exploitative and contradictory social order---an ideology capable of
"hardly say\[ing\] more than things are the way they are" \[73\] (p.
202)---it contributes to the maintenance and reproduction of the social
order. Stated differently, technological rationality molds all social
and environmental problems into technological problems requiring
technological solutions, because this mode of thinking is blind to what
is possible given different social conditions.

Marcuse argued that the progressive ends of science and technology have
been lost amid the means-oriented and "neutral" scientific project.
Although science has become a "pillar of the established institutions
and policies" in reality, the individual scientist may wrongly think
they are "the dissociated withdrawn researcher" \[74\] (p. 158). In
other words, the techno-scientific project is one-sidedly concerned with
"how" questions---impressed and captivated by the achievements of
scientific progress---without reflecting on the sometimes destructive
ends it serves.

Exploring the social dimensions of technology and the technological
dimensions of society through the critical tradition illuminates aspects
of what is and what is possible in ways that major contemporary
approaches in STS, such as actor-network theory, may miss. By directing
analyses of the social-technological-environmental interface toward
undesirable power relations and social inequalities produced by the
basic processes of capitalism---an abstract category rejected by
radically empirical and micro-sociological "posthuman" approaches to
STS---a critical approach is better positioned to grasp, expose, and,
thus, potentially overcome undesirable power relations, inequality, and
environmental harm \[75\]. In the case of geoengineering, a Marcusian
perspective highlights the interests and structure of capital and
instrumental rationality in the geoengineering agenda. We acknowledge
that any theory is partial, however. One potential disadvantage of the
critical theory tradition for STS, as admitted by Hornborg \[75\] (p.
101), is contentment in abstraction and lack of attention to concrete
social relations and artifacts, a limitation we hope to avoid in our
critique of geoengineering. Despite the differences between critical
theory and contemporary strands of STS, Feenberg \[67\] (p. 46)
commended STS scholars for lending empirical support to Marcuse's
argument that technological artifacts do, in fact, incorporate social
values, or, the stance that "technology is social in much the same way
as law or education or medicine insofar as it is similarly influenced by
interests and public processes" (see also \[35\] (pp. 103ff)).

Marcuse's and Feenberg's work on the relationship between technology and
[[cap]{.mark}italism [opens]{.mark} up [space for analyzing proposed
geoengineering strategies as dangerous and contradictory]{.mark}
technologies to further the domination of nature for the aims of
capital's self-expansion and self-accumulation]{.underline}. Drawing
from Marcuse and Feenberg, we argue that [[econ]{.mark}omic rationality
[and tech]{.mark}nological rationality are [mutually]{.mark} reinforcing
in [justify]{.mark}ing [the]{.mark} possible [deployment of
geoengineering]{.mark}]{.underline}. After discussing geoengineering and
risks in Section 3, we examine the role of economic rationality (Section
4.1) and technological rationality (Section 4.2) in legitimating the
potential deployment of geoengineering.

3\. Geoengineering: A Technological Solution to Climate Change

3.1. Geoengineering

While climate change projections portend dramatic and lasting
consequences well into the future \[76\], global efforts to reduce
emissions and limit warming have thus far failed. This has led some
scientists to call for more aggressive actions to reduce GHG emissions,
including a target to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to 350
ppm \[77\]. The failure of the international community to commit to
binding targets to reduce emissions coupled with existing and projected
consequences have led to increasing arguments that geoengineering is a
global necessity \[78,79,80,81\]. Even the latest Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \[76\] assessment discusses
geoengineering strategies and their potential to reduce the impacts of
climate change. Paul Crutzen, in his influential 2006 article in
Climatic Change \[64\], advocated the need to research geoengineering in
earnest and in doing so established geoengineering as a legitimate
course of action that demanded attention. However, geoengineering has a
much longer history, preceded by an even longer history of attempts to
control and master the weather and climate \[82\].

The IPCC defines geoengineering as, "a broad set of methods and
technologies that aim to deliberately alter the climate system in order
to alleviate impacts of climate change" \[83\]. Scientists have proposed
a range of geoengineering approaches that fall into two general
categories: Solar Radiation Management (SRM), or, "albedo modification"
\[5\], and Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) \[22\]. While we touch on a
range of geoengineering strategies, our focus is the most widely
discussed SRM option: stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI). We selected
SAI for analysis because it is the only proposed SRM strategy that is
considered low-cost and with high potential to prevent warming \[2,84\].
A second reason for selecting SAI is it is considered highly risky
\[2,5\], providing an ideal entry point for addressing our underpinning
research question: What structural forces and forms of rationality have
driven the recent agenda for geoengineering?

SAI, the strategy put forth by Crutzen \[78\], is "\[o\]ften heralded as
the most promising solar geoengineering proposal in terms of their
effectiveness" \[4\] (p. 600). Volcanic eruptions have provided a way to
assess the effect sulfur particles in the atmosphere have on incoming
solar radiation and global temperature. The Mt. Pinatubo eruption in
1991 led to dimming that cooled the earth by 0.5 °C for a year \[85\].
Injecting sulfur particles (sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, sulfuric
acid) into the atmosphere represents an attempt to emulate this process.
Sulfate aerosols can be put into the stratosphere by release from
planes, balloons, or ground canons. Once in the atmosphere, the
particles combine with dust and water, creating aerosols that increase
atmospheric albedo. Aerosols would likely last for about one year;
therefore, this strategy requires continued sulfate deposition \[81\].
Model results suggest that this approach may be very effective, locally
and globally, and it continues to garner the most attention in terms of
the number of scientific studies \[86\]---many of which are examining
different types of particles that could be injected into the
stratosphere \[87\].

3.2. Risks of Geoengineering

["I think \[geoengineering\] may be infinitely more dangerous than
climate change, largely due to the suspicion and social disruption it
would trigger by changing humanity's relationship to
nature."]{.underline}

---James Fleming (quoted in \[88\])

There are a number of risks associated with SRM in general and SAI in
particular. It remains unclear how SRM may affect weather patterns,
especially precipitation and therefore ecological and agricultural
systems \[89,90\]. A modeling study supports previous results,
indicating that the pumping of sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere
may result in drought in South America, Asia, and Africa, assuming a 4
°C temperature rise would be compensated via SAI \[91\]. As stated by a
leading geoengineering scientist: "used recklessly, geoengineering could
threaten billions with starvation" \[81\] (p. 58). However, Keith and
MacMartin \[90\] argued that this not need be the case: impacts and
risks will depend on how SRM is deployed. Others have highlighted how
sulfate aerosols do nothing to address ocean acidification and could
exacerbate the ozone hole problem, increase acid rain and air pollution,
have unknown impacts on plants and clouds, and reduce radiation for
solar power---in addition to risks associated with human error,
commercial control, and military use \[83,84,86,92,93\]. Lastly, there
are serious concerns about risks to human health \[94,95\].

Perhaps the gravest risk associated with SRM, including SAI, because it
only "masks the problem" \[5\] (p. 145), relates to continued carbon
emissions. SRM could reduce incoming solar radiation, allowing for
continued GHG emissions. If the intervention works initially but
falters, or if the project cannot be maintained, temperatures could
increase rapidly due to a buildup of background GHG emissions, a risk
known as the "termination effect". A modeling study found that
implementing SRM for 25 years and then stopping could abruptly increase
temperatures by 4 °C, with severe impacts on agriculture and
biodiversity \[96\]. Scientists have warned that political instability
could abruptly halt SRM and result in a rapid temperature spike \[79\].
As a leading scientist who supports this approach acknowledges, SRM is
"a powerful and frightening tool" \[81\] (p. 67).

As so much of what is understood is currently based on models, many
risks related to geoengineering will remain unknown unless or until the
strategies are implemented. [The inherent [uncertainty and
ignorance]{.mark} related to geoengineering science [makes it incredibly
risky]{.mark}]{.underline}. Given the vast number of unknowns, many
scientists continue to question how we can engineer a system we still do
not understand \[79,80\]. The possible risks and the extent of unknowns
associated with geoengineering bring to the forefront the question: What
structural forces and forms of rationality have driven the recent agenda
for geoengineering?

Scientists, scholars, and policy-makers continue to debate supporting
geoengineering research apart from the intention of implementing
geoengineering. Some researchers may wish to develop SRM or CDR
technologies, for the sake of science, without the intent to modify the
Earth's climate. Others argue that a Plan B is critical: as the impacts
of climate change become more severe, geoengineering may represent the
only way to dampen the impacts and save lives \[81\]. Long and others
\[97\] contended that we need research to understand the full risks and
benefits of geoengineering so that we can decide whether or not to
proceed with geoengineering strategies. In contrast, Hamilton \[98\] (p.
139) argued, "No, we should not just 'at least do the research'," citing
a number of ethical and governance issues. He referred to the divide
over atomic weapons research and pointed out that, "it would be naïve of
researchers to imagine they can isolate themselves in a cocoon of
scientific neutrality, nor can they absolve themselves of responsibility
for how their schemes might be used or misused in the future" \[32\] (p.
21).

Some researchers, however, now clearly support eventual deployment.
David Keith, the leading proponent of SRM research, advocated for
research only until his 2013 book, in which he discusses specific routes
for eventual SRM deployment and calls it cheap and easy \[81\]. Long and
others \[97\] (p. 30) called for government funding to support climate
engineering research, stating that "calls for intervention may grow" and
it is critical to start with small-scale experiments immediately and
make research transparent and for the public good. However, Stilgoe
\[99\] warned that as geoengineering becomes a legitimate scientific
field, controversy around research becomes neutralized and the
technology becomes deterministic. Although we sometimes analyze
arguments used to justify geoengineering research, the remainder of this
article focuses on reasons given for possible deployment. We explore how
the work of Marcuse can reveal insights regarding the role of capital,
ideas about mastery and domination, and instrumental rationality in the
major arguments for eventual deployment. It should be noted that while
many scientists and scholars have opinions on deployment, we focus on
some of the most vocal proponents of geoengineering.

4\. Drivers of the Geoengineering Agenda: Instrumental Rationality and
Social Context

4.1. Geoengineering Is the Economically Rational Choice

"\[M\]an encounters nature as transformed by society, subjected to a
specific rationality which became, to an ever-increasing extent,
technological, instrumentalist rationality, bent to the requirements of
capitalism."

---Herbert Marcuse \[70\] (pp. 59--60)

The political-economic context that gave rise to geoengineering
strategies is best understood as a contradiction between capital's need
to accumulate and expand, on the one hand, and the destructive effects
expansionistic production has on the conditions of production,
specifically the climate system, on the other \[100,101,102\]. We agree
with Weis \[100\] (pp. 318--319) that, "\[t\]he failure to account for
the atmospheric burden associated with fossil energy, and its impact on
the Earth's climate system, represents one of the most fundamental
biophysical contradictions of industrial capitalism". The
capital-climate contradiction is a monumental rendition of O'Connor's
\[103\] (p. 162) "second contradiction of [capitalism," whereby
"individual capitals defend or restore profits by strategies that
degrade or fail to maintain over time the material conditions of their
own production". In other words, capital's drive to self-accumulate may
undermine its ability to do so by destabilizing a massive condition of
production]{.underline} (i.e., the climate system). Thus, the
capital-climate contradiction represents a "creative self-destruction"
\[101\]. This contradiction is built into the fundamental processes that
characterize capitalism. "Treadmill of production" theory posits that
capitalist economies must constantly expand production, creating a
production cycle (a "treadmill") that increases energy and resource
throughput ("withdrawals") and "additions" (pollution) into the
environment \[104,105\], a perspective that has been reiterated in
relation to climate change in various ways \[106\] (pp. 352--357). Work
in political ecology highlights how environmental problems can be traced
(through chains of explanation) to larger-scale economic relationships
that prioritize capital accumulation and further contradictions (e.g.,
\[107,108,109\]).

The problem of climate change is clearly linked to economic growth.
Macro-level empirical research and projections show that economic growth
is a major driver of GHG emissions and continued economic growth is
antithetical to substantial emissions reductions (e.g., \[110,111\]; for
summary of findings concerning economic growth and resource use in
general, see \[112\], pp. 5ff). As summarized by Hickel \[113\] for a
popular audience, "we're only using fossil fuels in the first place to
fuel the broader imperative of GDP growth. The root problem is the fact
that our economic system demands ever-increasing levels of extraction,
production and consumption". Marcuse \[70\] (p. 61) recognized these
general trends early on: ["it is obvious to what extent the violation of
nature is inseparable from the economy of capitalism".
[Cap]{.mark}italism remains [the root driver of climate
change]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Capitalist societies have responded to the capital-climate contradiction
in a number of ways. One response popular in the United States is to
deny the reality and/or severity of anthropogenic climate change, a
response sold to the public by a powerful coalition of fossil fuel
industries, conservative think tanks and politicians, contrarian
scientists, and other actors \[114\]. Less pathological responses than
outright denial include establishing carbon markets, various energy
efficiency measures, and the expansion of renewable energy. The
increasingly popular climate policy frame of "green growth"
\[115,116\]---alternatively, the "green economy" \[117\] or the "green
transition" \[118\]---combines the greening of technology and markets in
a coherent and appealing narrative and approaches climate mitigation as
a capital accumulation strategy, highlighting the economic benefits of
environmental protection and the supposed "synergies" between
environmental protection and economic growth (for sympathetic overview,
see \[116\]; for critical accounts, see \[119\]). However, carbon
markets (e.g., \[120,121\]), improved efficiency (e.g., \[122\]), and
renewable energy expansion (e.g., \[123,124\]) have all been shown to
have limited success and unintended impacts (for overview, see \[102\]).
Attempts to surmount the capital-climate contradiction that do not
address the drive to accumulate capital will probably fail to
significantly reduce emissions and, as Marcuse's critical theory of
capitalism would predict, will conceal, rather than address, the
contradiction \[102,125\].

It is only in this political-economic context that arguments supporting
geoengineering acquire any validity and, we predict, will continue to
gain traction. [[Geoengineering]{.mark}, a[s a]{.mark} distinct kind of
[strategy to conceal the cap]{.mark}ital-[climate
contradiction]{.mark},]{.underline} may be in conflict with the
prominent mitigation strategies described above in the sense that
geoengineering may lessen the motivation to reduce emissions by
diminishing their negative impacts, thereby undermining the potential
monetary gains of those banking on "green growth". We cannot predict if
the interests of those with stakes in these different paths to
climate-related profit-making will conflict or cooperate in the future.
Regardless, geoengineering is related to established mitigation
strategies in at least two ways: (1) the frustration resulting from the
latter's relative failure underpins the case for geoengineering \[41\]
and, (2) as explained in this subsection, geoengineering, like the
greening of technology and markets, is a response to the capital-climate
contradiction that masks and reproduces, rather than addresses and moves
beyond, the driving force underlying the contradiction (i.e., the drive
to accumulate capital). This is especially clear in arguments concerning
the "cost-effectiveness" of geoengineering and geoengineering as an
accumulation strategy itself (i.e., geoengineering itself can generate
profits). Illustrating Marcuse's description of economic rationality,
monetary and cost-benefit reasoning has dominated arguments in support
of geoengineering from early on, even among scientists \[8\]. For
example, deceased hydrogen bomb scientist Edward Teller claimed that
geoengineering approaches would only cost \$100 million or \$1 billion a
year compared to the \$100 billion a year estimated to reduce fossil
fuel usage to address "a problem that may not exist" \[126\]. According
to Crutzen \[78\], SAI approaches would cost about \$25--50 billion per
year, over 100 times less expensive than emissions reduction \[127\]. As
stated by the two leading scientists and dominant voices in current
geoengineering discussions, Caldeira and Keith \[128\] (p. 57),
"geoengineering could be the only affordable and fast-acting option to
avoid a global catastrophe". Compared to other approaches, SAI is
especially being touted as a cheap and easy fix for climate change, and
while the exact costs are still uncertain, they could be in the range of
\$700 million per year \[81\]. David Keith called SRM: "a cheap tool
that could green the world" \[81\] (p. x).

[[Economists are]{.mark} even more [explicit about geoengineering being
the best choice to address climate change]{.mark}, further illustrating
economic rationality]{.underline}. A panel of five leading economists
organized by Bjorn Lomborg, including three Nobel Prize winners, ranked
the best ways to address climate change: increasing cloud reflection was
ranked first with reducing carbon emissions ranked twelfth \[79\].
Economists Bickel and Lane \[129\] concluded that the benefits outweigh
the costs of geoengineering: every dollar spent on SAI will yield \$25.
The authors of the book Superfreakonomics \[130\], a popular book on
economics for the general public, also argued that lowering carbon
emissions is too costly and too complex in comparison to SRM---a cheaper
and simpler plan. In short, these geoengineering strategies represent a
simple, lower cost alternative to reducing GHG emissions: the economics
of geoengineering are "incredible" \[131\].

Despite claims of cheapness, projections of SAI cost-effectiveness tend
to ignore the costs of potential side-effects \[8\]. Most figures
include only operational costs, ignoring the external costs or
side-effects related to deployment that would likely vary regionally,
could be catastrophic (e.g., significantly reduce crop yields), and are
impossible to predict \[132\]. Furthermore, while geoengineering
proponents claim that aggressively reducing GHG emissions would have
devastating impacts on the global economy, the IPCC \[133\] predicts
that waiting longer to implement mitigation actions will result in
greater economic losses in the future.

The sociological issue, however, is more subtle than the validity of the
problematic cost-effectiveness justification. [The issue is that
[profit-maximization is the]{.mark} only ["argument"]{.mark}
[that]{.mark} really [matters]{.mark} in capitalist societies
[and]{.mark} consistently [overrides other values]{.mark} and
possibilities]{.underline}. In addition to its assumed
cost-effectiveness, geoengineering represents an accumulation strategy,
i.e., it represents a way to address climate change while supporting
business investments and economic growth. Despite a lack of government
funding \[97\], investments are already increasing in geoengineering
technology. Entrepreneurs and companies have patented geoengineering
technologies in hopes of future returns on their investments, setting up
a trajectory for deployment \[80\]. Long and Scott \[134\] raised some
important questions about the vested interests in geoengineering
research, highlighting how individuals (e.g., Bill Gates) and companies
who have invented geoengineering technologies may try to manipulate
policy decision-making processes in order to make money. In addition,
companies may suppress studies with findings contrary to their best
interests, use questionable methods, or misrepresent information.
[[Geoengineering could become]{.mark} an industry [similar to
biotech]{.mark}nology, where companies advertise humanitarian goals,
while [profiting from innovations that]{.mark} may [pose]{.mark} serious
[risks]{.mark} to society]{.underline}. While governmental bodies will
likely make the ultimate decisions whether to implement specific
geoengineering strategies, those with financial interests could attempt
to sway the decision-making process in their favor.

This subsection provided three reasons that the rationality used to make
the case for the potential future deployment of geoengineering
strategies "incorporate" the value of capital's necessary
self-expansion, a central claim in the critical theory of technology.
[First, the emergence of geoengineering as a climate change strategy,
especially those that are highly risky, makes sense only in a
political-economic context that is structurally incapable of reducing
GHG emissions through the contraction of economic growth. That is,
geoengineering is rooted in a "pregiven reality":]{.underline} an
ecologically destructive social formation likely incapable of overcoming
the capital-climate contradiction. Second, a common case for
geoengineering strategies, especially SAI, is that it is much cheaper
than GHG emissions reductions. [Third, geoengineering is already being
explored as an accumulation strategy, or, as a means to make
money.]{.underline}

4.2. Geoengineering Would Be a Techno-Scientific Achievement

"Contemporary positivism ... define\[s\] and filter\[s\] the universe of
discourse for the use of technicians, specialists, and experts who
calculate, adjust, and match without ever asking for whom or for what.
The occupation of these specialists is to make things work, but not to
give an end to this process."

---Herbert Marcuse \[63\] (p. 122)

Although proponents of geoengineering are uneasy about their support
\[10\], many proponents, including scientists, have directly stated or
indicated that geoengineering would represent an exciting and
groundbreaking scientific achievement. Astrophysicist Lowell Wood, a
strong and vocal proponent of geoengineering, stated, "\[w\]e've
engineered every other environment we live in- why not the planet?"
(quoted in \[135\]). In his recent book on SRM, David Keith \[81\] (pp.
173--174) declared that, "\[w\]e may use these powers for good or ill,
but it is hard not to delight in these newfound tools". The development
of geoengineering technology represents the advancement of scientific
achievement and progress. Even with the great number of possible risks,
some scientists argue that the only way to proceed is with larger scale
testing and eventual deployment \[80,81\], with one stating, "we don't
know how to ride a bicycle when we start, but we end up doing it"
(quoted in \[79\], p. 179). The quotes in this section illustrate
notions of mastery (total control) over a mechanical universe
(technological rationality).

[Those promoting and funding geoengineering are often techno-optimists
who believe that the human race can invent its way out of problems. For
example, David Keith argued that humans have a long history of
successfully using techno-fixes to address problems and suggests SRM is
the next big techno-fix \[81\]. In addition, Bill Gates is the world's
leading financial supporter of geoengineering innovations and is known
for viewing climate change as a technical problem that can be fixed
through innovation.]{.underline} He provides money for a research fund
run by Caldeira and Keith and has invested in geoengineering technology
through companies: Silver Lining, Carbon Engineering Ltd., and
Intellectual ventures \[80\]. Gates also has his name on at least one
geoengineering patent. [He has dismissed or belittled approaches relying
on renewable energy, calling these strategies "cute" with solar power
being the "cutest" \[136\], and supports efforts to discover
technological breakthroughs that will transform our relationship with
the climate \[137\].]{.underline} For Gates and other techno-optimists,
society can address climate change simply through identifying and
developing the appropriate high-tech fixes.

Beyond using geoengineering as a techno-fix to change nature, to some
proponents it represents a way for humans to use technology to wholly
master nature. Scientists have long sought out techno-fixes to alter the
environment, looking for levers that can be switched to change nature
\[65\]. In his 2013 book, David Keith \[81\] repeatedly framed SRM as
ultra-powerful leverage over the climate. To some, geoengineering
represents the ultimate trump card. In newspapers, 46 percent of
articles frame geoengineering as a techno-fix or quick fix, allowing
humans to change nature \[43\]. Overall, talk among scientists, captured
by journalists and authors, indicates that many frame geoengineering in
a language of techno-glorification. It has been equated with using
"eco-judo" and as a way to "play god" \[43,79,80\]. Scientists and
entrepreneurs are also discussing moving beyond geoengineering as a way
to address climate change, exploring how they can use geoengineering
technology to tailor the climate to optimal conditions \[80\].

Dominant portrayals of geoengineering in the media indicate that it is
seen as a simple application of technology to control a mechanistic
system. Research on the use of metaphors offers a means to understand
how geoengineering is viewed among scientists and journalists and how
these messages are being transferred to the public. Metaphor usage
indicates that the planet is viewed as a machine and geoengineering as a
useful tool to fix or control the machine \[40\]. Using medical
metaphors, geoengineering has been called sunscreen for the planet
\[126\], a cure for a sick planet, chemotherapy for the planet,
liposuction for the planet, and an ice bath for a raging fever
\[40,79\]. These statements indicate that geoengineering is seen as a
logical tool to address the problem of climate change. They also
illustrate reductionist thinking applied to a highly complex and
unpredictable system.

The notion of technological rationality developed by Marcuse and
Feenberg can help explain why geoengineering schemes are taken seriously
among some policy makers and scientists. Or, stated differently, one can
hypothesize why more substantive and even radical social alternatives
are not. Geoengineering schemes exemplify technological rationality's
reduction of nature to "stuff of control and organization" \[1\] (p.
153) in order to control the natural world through "classification,
quantification, and control" \[35\] (p. 87). Coupled with the
technological rationality used to conceive of, and justify, injecting
sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere, the latter technical process
itself is part of the ideological character of the geoengineering
agenda, in which ideology is understood as ideas and practices that
conceal real contradictions \[138\]. If ever set in motion, SAI would be
an awesome material manifestation of the ideological masking of the
capital-climate contradiction. Portrayed as a means to control nature,
this process appears as a decisive techno-scientific achievement and the
rational way forward. As put by Hamilton \[80\] (p. 174): ["technologies
gather added political momentum because we live in societies predisposed
to seek technological answers to social problems".]{.underline} Many may
be lured by the promise of a giant techno-fix that allows for the
further mastery of nature, especially when technology is broadly
understood as "the form of modern experience itself, the principal way
in which the world is revealed" \[35\] (p. xiii). In a one-dimensional
society, where technical achievements primarily serve giant industries
who "deliver the goods"---and, in this case, deliver the
solutions---there is a tendency to identify with the system and dominant
rationality. This is what Marcuse \[62\] (p. 143) called the "matter of
factness" attitude that inhibits forms of thinking and acting that could
create a qualitatively different social formation.

Related to the repelling of social alternatives, pure technological
rationality works against reflection on the goodness of ends. This is a
problem in the context of climate change because, as Gardiner \[139\]
argued, climate change is the "perfect moral storm," or, a convergence
of complex global, intergenerational, and theoretical issues that makes
answering and responding to ethical questions difficult, increasing
susceptibility to moral corruption and inaction. In another powerful
analogy borrowed from the climate scientist Gavin Schmidt, climate
change is analogized as a boat being rocked by one traveler (polluters)
and another traveler (geoengineers) "offers to use his knowledge of
chaotic dynamics to try to counterbalance the first \[polluters\], but
admits that he needs huge informational resources to do so, cannot
guarantee success, and may make things worse" \[33\] (p. 249). Of
course, the analogy is loaded, as it would be better for the "reckless,
callous, and shallow" boat rocker to "just sit down" (reduce emissions)
than to risk further human influence on the climate system \[33\] (p.
249).

Before concluding the discussion of geoengineering from the perspective
of Marcuse's theory of technological rationality, [Gardiner's boat
rocking analogy is a helpful entry point for briefly commenting on how
Marcuse can contribute to the discussion of climate ethics and the
ethics of geoengineering]{.underline}. As stressed in this project,
Marcuse helps explain why the boat rocker cannot sit down (the drive to
accumulate capital), why counteracting this rocking is suggested as an
alternative to sitting down (the reproduction of capital accumulation),
and why this alternative is increasingly considered a viable solution to
climate change (the radical instrumentalization of reason). In other
words, as stressed in this project, Marcuse's primary contribution to
ethical reflection about climate change and geoengineering is "negative"
and sociological (i.e., placing these ethical considerations in
socio-economic context and predicting that capitalist society may be
structurally incapable of responding ethically). However, Marcusian
thought can make positive contributions as well. Marcuse's distinction
between essence and appearance (see Section 2.2) is not only analytical,
but also an "ethical imperative, which states that our existence ought
to conform to our essence" \[140\] (p. 95). The latter entails a search
for social movements and actors who may have be able to overcome the
capital-climate contradiction and form a society in which humanity is
able to "sit down" (reduce emissions) and be happy. Gunderson \[60\] (p.
231) argued that the movement to sustainably contract the economy
("degrowth") (see Section 2.1) is Marcusian in nature. Marcuse's \[71\]
support of Third World liberation indicates that he would side with the
Global South in questions of global climate justice. Further, influenced
by Walter Benjamin's messianism \[35\] (p. 19), questions of
intergenerational climate justice would be imperative for Marcuse,
informed by a future-oriented analysis of what is potential in the
current social order. Finally, his late work on the "new sensibility"
and "new technology" (e.g., \[70,71\]) have applications for discussions
of environmental solutions, including climate change responses \[66\].
While a systematic elaboration of these insights sits outside of the
aims of this project, there are positive contributions to be learned
from Marcuse, and critical theory more generally, in climate ethics and
politics.

As stressed by Marcuse and Feenberg, economic and technological
rationality are mutually reinforcing forms of instrumentality. Failure
to consider the end goals and consequences, while focusing instead on
[technological progress and immediate economic growth, results in
another instance of what Marcuse \[1\] (p. 9) called [the most "vexing"
aspect of]{.mark} advanced [cap]{.mark}italism: "the rational character
of its irrationality". A low-cost, industry-friendly, and high-tech
solution appeals to "reason," but [the use of tech]{.mark}nology [to
solve problems is contradictory when it does not address the root causes
of problems]{.mark} and the technological means overshadow the ultimate
outcomes]{.underline}, casting aside the required social changes.
Further, technological rationality, because it cannot detect potential
social alternatives to the current order and mitigates against ethical
reflection, serves the current social order.

5\. Conclusions

Discussions of geoengineering often focus on technical or means-oriented
questions (i.e., "how" questions), overlooking the ends and interests
involved. [To interrogate the "whys" of geoengineering, we have applied
Herbert Marcuse's theorization of the relations between technology,
capitalism, rationality, and nature.]{.underline} This project brings
substantive discussions of geoengineering forward through the following
lines of argumentation: ([1) geoengineering is a contradictory solution
to a systemic contradiction between capital accumulation and climate
stability; (2) the value of profit-maximization---or, more
fundamentally, the structural drive to accumulate capital---shapes
justifications for the possible deployment of geoengineering; and (3)
technological rationality is a constitutive element of the case for
geoengineering, a form of reason that aids in the reproduction of the
social order (as opposed to locating alternative social futures). We
argue that [geoengineering]{.mark}---specifically SAI---[supports
economic priorities]{.mark} (and powerful financial actors), [protects
an]{.mark} inherently [ecologically harmful social formation, and
relegates]{.mark} the fundamental social-structural [changes needed to
actually address c]{.mark}limate [c]{.mark}hange.]{.underline}

Inverting our argument may clarify our thesis: emissions reductions,
unlike geoengineering, are expensive, rely more on social-structural
than technical changes, and are at odds with the current system (i.e.,
the current social system may be structurally incapable of significantly
reducing emissions). Because of this, we predict that geoengineering
strategies, no matter how risky, will increasingly be considered
principal means to combat climate change, perhaps even as alternatives
to emissions reductions. Indeed, our discussion takes on particular
importance, as enthusiasm for geoengineering is increasing among
high-level officials in the Trump administration and the Republican
Party \[141,142\], and unprecedented outdoor geoengineering experiments
are now moving forward \[143\]. The Stratospheric Controlled
Perturbation Experiment, for example, which is planned to take place in
early 2018 in Arizona, will represent a critical outdoor experiment for
SRM researchers and will involve the launch of balloons containing up to
a kilogram of aerosol particles \[144\].

[From a critical theoretical perspective, the fact that geoengineering
is "getting ever closer to the mainstream" \[10\] (p. xii) (see also
\[32\]) is a clear indication of (1) capitalism's inability to overcome
the capital-climate contradiction]{.underline} and (2) the radical
instrumentalization of reason. The emergence of the geoengineering
agenda is incomprehensible outside of this context. It would not make
sense to inject millions of tons of sulfate aerosols into the
stratosphere, for example, in a society capable of casting off
growth-dependence, organizing production to meet needs, and interacting
with the biophysical world in non-destructive ways. [The models and
techniques put forth by the geoengineering agenda are not simply
ecologically and socially risky, they are, as Marcuse predicted, rooted
in a vision of a nature as a set of passive resources that can be fully
controlled in line with the demands of capital]{.underline}. Thus, we
agree with others that bringing the question of capitalism to the
forefront of social-environmental analysis, as opposed to assuming
capitalism's naturalness or immutability, [is [crucial]{.mark} for
explaining environmental harms, shedding light on unsustainable
solutions [to]{.mark} the environmental crisis, and [locat]{.mark}ing
[more sustainable social futures]{.mark} \[145\].]{.underline}

When promoted as a cheap, high-tech, and market-friendly strategy due to
insufficient emissions reductions, the whys of geoengineering reflect a
society that transforms what should be considered means (technology and
economic production) into ends themselves. Such a condition echoes the
early Frankfurt School's primary thesis: instrumental rationality
remains "irrational". With the proliferation of a form of reason
incapable of formulating substantively rational ends, [the development
and spread of capitalism, and unreflective technical progress, reason
has lost its aim (the emancipation of human beings), and the [domination
of humans and nature has become an end-in-itself]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Reason remains contradictory and irrational when it endures as the
"frantic development of productivity, conquest of nature, \[and\]
enlargement of the mass of goods" \[72\] (p. 207).

One goal of "critique" since Hegel is to achieve "reflection on a system
of constraints which are humanly produced" in order to overcome
undesirable power relations \[146\] (p. 18). The underlying goal of this
project was to shed light on the humanly produced political-economic
context that gave birth to risky responses to climate change, and the
forms of rationality used to justify these responses. This is the first
step toward formulating rational social alternatives that do not require
potentially catastrophic responses to climate change. There are likely
readers who, like us, find fault in the techno-optimistic and economic
justifications for geoengineering and are aware of its social and
ecological risks. However, these readers may still reasonably think that
geoengineering, although risky, may be our only large-scale option at
some point in the future. Or, as the U.S. NRC's \[5\] (p. 146) report on
SRM put it:

\[m\]itigation, although technologically feasible, has been difficult to
achieve for political, economic, and social reason that may persist well
into the future. ... Although there are ongoing efforts at climate
adaptation in many communities, both humans and ecosystems face
substantial challenges in adapting to the varied impacts of climate
change over the coming century. For that reason, it is prudent to
examine other options \[i.e., geoengineering\] for limiting the risks
from climate change, even as mitigation and adaptation remain the
primary emphasis.

However, [geoengineering is a dangerous and contradictory attempt to
transform the problem---the domination of nature through technology in
the service of capitalism---into the solution]{.underline}. The drastic
changes needed to reduce emissions involve fundamental changes in our
social formation. If the latter course is cast off as more utopian and
unrealistic than SAI, for example, perhaps Adorno \[147\] (pp. 107--108)
was right to claim that, ["\[t\]he horror is that for the first time we
live in a world in which we can no longer imagine a better
one]{.underline}"

innate **[competitive qualities]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Ruffini, 2020a,
2020b). In this view, SD needs to be understood as a tool for "those
disposed towards morality and ethics in international affairs and those
who see the world in terms of power politics" (Ruffini, 2020b, p. 372;
emphasis added). SD speaks to both of these camps because on the one
hand it "brings to the forefront the need and will of countries to find
common ground" (Ruffini, 2020b, p. 379). On the other, it relates to the
scientific aspects of attractiveness, access and ability to exert
influence (Flink & Schreiterer, 2010). In other words, [SD can take on a
competitive and a collaborative form.]{.underline} [A fitting example
that illustrates SD's dual nature are so-called science and innovation
centers or networks]{.underline}. During the past two decades, countries
like the UK and Switzerland have established such hubs in strategic
locations, for example, in BRICS countries, to promote their national
education, research and innovation systems abroad (Epping, 2020, p. 4).
On the one hand, these hubs are used to find partners in host countries
and to set up cooperative programs. [On the other, [they]{.mark} also
[serve **economic**]{.mark} [**objectives** such as securing]{.mark}
national [competitiveness by strengthening]{.mark} a country's
[education, research and]{.mark} i[nnovation]{.mark} system [through
internationalization]{.mark}, visibility and occasionally also brain
gain]{.underline} (Epping, 2020, p. 11; UK Science and Innovation
Network, n.i.). Another highly topical example of how collaborative D4S
can turn into competitive S4D is the race to find corona vaccines. [At
the [beginning of]{.mark} the [COVID]{.mark}-19 pandemic, most
[governments promoted]{.mark} [open data]{.mark} sharing to accelerate
international research on the virus]{.underline} (Grimm, 2020[). [This
cooperative stance]{.mark} [changed quickly]{.mark},]{.underline}
however, the further scientists around the world progressed with vaccine
development. [Terms like vaccine nationalism or vaccine diplomacy
[illustrate how]{.mark} the US and other wealthy [countries]{.mark}
eventually [put national needs]{.mark} and interests [above global
ones]{.mark}]{.underline} (Kupferschmidt, 2020). The review of the
literature has important implications for the present study of SD in the
Arctic. First, one cannot assume that all actors in the area agree on a
single definition of the term. It is far more likely that every country
and governmental agency employs its own concept of SD in line with its
respective ambitions, capacities and goals. These agendas do not
necessarily tally with those of non-governmental, international
organizations or individual scientists. Research shows that the latter
have a good understanding of SD, but at the same time a strong aversion
against being instrumentalized for its ends (Fähnrich, 2017). Second,
the relation between science and politics is not as simple as suggested
in some accounts. Science is neither necessarily disinterested or
neutral, nor is there always international consensus on scientific
questions. [Instead, scientific insights, science organizations and
individual scientists might serve (willingly or unconsciously) both
national or regional/transnational agendas. Thus, while [science]{.mark}
might provide solutions for policy problems in one area, at other times
it [might]{.mark} [be utilised to support competitive policy
objectives]{.mark} in another.]{.underline} For instance, SD might be
seen and championed as a means to ease foreign policy tensions between
rivaling countries. [Yet on other occasions, [actors rely on science to
seize economic opportunities]{.mark} in competition with other
actors]{.underline} (Flink & Schreiterer, 2010; Ruffini, 2020a). [This
blurry boundary between science, diplomacy and economic
considerations]{.underline} is thus another indicator of the
shortcomings of the taxonomy proposed by the Royal Society and AAAS.

"[We've been paying a fraction of what things really cost to make, but
meanwhile the planet, and the workers who make the stuff, take the
unpaid costs right in the teeth]{.underline}" (Robinson 4). Modern
economic growth and demand for goods require rapid production at low
costs, leading to the inevitable exploitation of nature and workers. Kim
Stanley Robinson's New York 2140 explores the world one hundred and
twenty years into the future, where the drastic continuation of climate
change has resulted in a 50-foot rise in the global sea level,
destroying coastal cities worldwide. Each section of the novel is broken
into 8 parts, seen through the eyes of 10 different characters living in
New York City in the year 2140. The characters hold various roles in
society, ranging from political leaders to investors to orphaned
children. Each of the characters' lives intertwine, showing their daily
interactions amid a changed and chaotic world. Robinson depicts what
everyday life would look like for New Yorkers, and the rest of the
world, if no significant measures are taken to prevent climate change
and environmental destruction. The novel highlights the income
inequalities that both drive climate change and influence how people
survive those changes. This paper examines two important narratives in
New York 2140 to argue [that [climate change is **driven by
capitalism,**]{.mark} which in turn changes how people experience
climate change.]{.underline}

[Global [capitalism and economic expansion are driving forces
for]{.mark} **both income inequality and [climate]{.mark}
[change]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The global economy within New York 2140
reflects the same systems in place today, with the existence of global
capitalism driving production and consumption. Most climate scientists
have come to agree that the cause of [climate change is the increased
emission of greenhouse gases, specifically carbon dioxide]{.underline},
which have increased rapidly since the Industrial Revolution (Baer 2[).
Progressive scholars recognize the serious damage that results from a
global capitalist drive. Endless [efforts]{.mark} of private owners
[to]{.mark} expand and [increase]{.mark} their [profits force a]{.mark}
"**[perpetual treadmill of production and consumption]{.mark}**"
[relying]{.mark} mainly [on fossil fuels]{.mark} or alternative sources
of greenhouse gas emissions (Baer 4). In 2010, the International Energy
Agency projected that by 2030, global energy use would rise over 50%,
with fossil fuels still the primary source of energy (Baer
64]{.underline}). Our continued dependence on the fossil fuel industry
will continue to raise global temperatures as a **[direct
result]{.underline}** of global capitalism. [The most [profitable
decisions will **never be**]{.mark} **[the most]{.mark} [environmentally
friendly]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[thus private owners of corporations
will refrain from making environmentally conscious decisions]{.mark}
without regulations.]{.underline}

In the United States, although the median household income reached a
high in 2018, the gap between the poorest and wealthiest households is
the biggest it has been in 50 years, potentially due to tax policies and
declining labor unions (Chappell). This disparity continues to widen
even among 10 years of Gross Domestic Product growth and low
unemployment rates, reflecting a "significantly higher" income gap in
2018 than 2017 (Chappell). These statistics present a serious concern
that economic expansion will be unable to decrease inequality between
American households, an idea which is also reflected in New York 2140
through the characters Franklin, Stephan, and Roberto. In order to
mitigate the impacts of climate change, it is important to understand
that "the commitment to free-market policies only generates a
combination of positive economic growth, increasing emissions and
increasing inequality." In other words, to decrease inequality in
combination with continued economic growth would require policymaking
that reforms carbon tax as well as prices carbon efficiently (Liobikienė
and Rimkuvienė). The difference in ways that wealthy and impoverished
people experience climate change is an important topic that will become
increasingly relevant as we continue to see global temperatures rise.

In the novel, the author evaluates several perspectives from which
individuals experience climate change. One of the many perspectives
analyzed by Robinson is shown through the eyes of Franklin Garr.
Franklin's chapters are narratives from the first-person point of view
describing his career success and personal life. He works for a large
and profitable hedge fund called WaterPrice, which tracks global
sea-level rise in relation to the stock market. A large accomplishment
for Franklin was his creation of the IPPI index, (the Intertidal
Property Pricing Index) a combination of a housing index with sea-level
changes, tracking inflation rates and pricing for intertidal properties,
despite being unable to predict if the sea level will remain stable in
the future. Franklin lives in the MetLife building, a skyscraper
connecting his life to several other characters from the novel. His
entire career and industry benefit from making bets based on the rise
and fall of sea level, showing that large companies and investors still
live profitable and successful lifestyles even after drastic changes to
global environments occur, continuing to worry only about their
individual assets.

[In our modern reality, the [individuals in the top 10%]{.mark} of
incomes [are]{.mark} credited with [over 36% of greenhouse gas
emissions]{.mark}, while [people]{.mark} that fall [in the bottom 50%
are]{.mark} only [responsible for 15%]{.mark} of emissions]{.underline}
(Liobikienė and Rimkuvienė). [This displays a pattern that while
[wealthier people]{.mark}]{.underline}, like Franklin, [[are more at
fault for the rise in global temperatures]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[they
tend to be unaffected or]{.mark} even [experience]{.mark}
[benefits]{.mark} [from]{.mark} [environmental]{.mark}
[damage]{.mark}]{.underline}. A changing climate is only seen by
Franklin as something that is affecting the economy, not the source of
mass extinction, food scarcity, and displacement of millions of people
worldwide. He explains that destruction of coastlines and homes have
opened the door for new investment opportunities, stating "Am I saying
that the floods, the worst catastrophe in human history, equivalent or
greater to the twentieth century's wars in their devastation, were
actually good for capitalism? Yes, I am" (Robinson 118). [[Climate
destruction]{.mark} is [brought about by economic expansion]{.mark} but
then [adds to]{.mark} the [profitability]{.mark} of wealthy people by
[making]{.mark} **their [investments more lucrative]{.mark}** [and their
property]{.mark} scarce, and thus more [valuable]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--RC\-\--Fish Decline

#### Cap is the root cause of fish decline

Dunkel 06, Dunkel is a writer for the workers world publishing paper
("Capitalist crisis of overfishing",
https://www.workers.org/2006/world/overfishing-1123/)//Marlo

Certainly there are [approaches that have some merit; fish farming is
one of them]{.underline}. Chinese and Vietnamese peasants have been
doing small-scale fish farming for 3,500 years. Quotas and licenses will
limit the catch of commercially viable stocks, but [might not touch the
destruction of biologically important but commercially insignificant
fish]{.underline}, which are often thrown overboard instead of being
landed. Add the fact that the oceans are big and it is [hard to catch or
stop illegal fishing]{.underline}.

But [[what is]{.mark} really [happening is the **capitalist drive** to
maximize]{.mark} profits by **maximizing [production]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} [minimizing costs]{.mark}]{.underline}. No individual
capitalist can respect the limits imposed to preserve a "sustainable
yield," because their competitors might not, which would mean less
profit and more risk. [Small fishers have to grow larger or be ground up
by floating factories]{.underline}.

The system of capitalist exploitation of natural resources has to be
challenged. Measures must be promoted that will save these resources
from depletion.

[[Capitalism emerged]{.mark} as a modern world economic system in the
1400s [with European **colonial expansion**.]{.mark}]{.underline} The
Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, English, and other nations invaded foreign
territories and seized their land[. [They turned the land into a
commodity to **exploit and generate wealth**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Colonizers relied on [[the enslavement of Native Americans and
Africans]{.mark} because unfree labor guaranteed the highest
profits.]{.underline} [They also used indentured servitude and contract
labor, which forced people to work for years without pay]{.underline}.
Women made up a significant part of this workforce.

[This violent process [allowed colonizers to accumulate **immense
wealt**h]{.mark} for their empires. [Slavery financed]{.mark} a wide
range of economic activity,]{.underline} such as shipbuilding,
railroads, banking, insurance, new forms of commerce[, [the rise of
manufacturing and industrialization]{.mark}.]{.underline}

European colonizers justified conquest and the imposition of capitalism
with the claim that they were racially superior and divinely sanctioned
to rule[. [Colonizers divided the world between **superior and inferior
people**]{.mark} --- civilized vs savage, Christian vs heathen, male vs
female, white vs Black, and [rich vs poor]{.mark}, etc. This worldview
became entrenched in capitalism. Colonialism imposed this world view
around the globe.]{.underline}

[[Today capitalism]{.mark} [continues to perpetuate]{.mark} white
supremacy, patriarchy**, [colonialism]{.mark}, imperialis**m, and other
forms of oppression]{.underline}. It also perpetuates a global division
of labor. For example, the nations from the Global South [are rich in
resources,]{.underline} but the poor do not control the wealth that is
generated from those resources. Instead, [they are often forced to
migrate to work in wealthier nations. Keeping domestic labor unpaid or
very low-wage has been central to this system of capital
accumulation.]{.underline}

Domestic workers have been among the most exploited under capitalism.
But they and their children have also formed some of the most visionary
movements for freedom. [Their liberation can challenge the entire system
of oppression and exploitation upon which capitalism is
based.]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--AT: Cap Solves Climate

#### **Effective Climate Change adaption is not compatible with Capitalism/No decarbonization under Capitalism**

**Mair 19**-- (Simon, \"Climate Change and Capitalism: A Political
Marxist View.'', New Socialist, July 7^th^, 2019,
https://newsocialist.org.uk/climate-capitalism-political-marxism/)//ggao

[Because of the structural drivers towards growth that we see [under
capitalism, it is]{.mark} extremely [unlikely that capitalism can avoid
catastrophic climate change.]{.mark} The structural drive for growth
means that [efforts to reduce carbon emissions will be overwhelmed
by]{.mark} the [expansion of economic activity.]{.mark}]{.underline}
This is controversial to most mainstream environmentalists (and to many
socialists). But it is the clear experience of the history of
capitalism.

[[To date, resources have not been conserved under capitalism.]{.mark}
Rather when we become more efficient or find new resources, this frees
up resources that are used by other parts of the capitalist
machine.]{.underline} This explains why, for example, renewable energy
and nuclear power remain only a small part of the global energy system
(Figure 2). [[Under capitalism, low-carbon energy sources have grown but
they have not replaced fossil fuel at any meaningful scale.]{.mark}
Instead low-carbon energy is simply another energy pot available to fuel
growth in economic activity in order to generate profits.]{.underline}

The same is also true of energy efficiency gains. [Energy efficiency can
be a key contributor for decarbonising the global economy. But only if
it is coupled to a plan to limit the size of the economy. Under
capitalism, energy efficiency measures actually drive economic growth.
This happens for the same reason renewable energy doesn't lead to
decarbonisation. Energy efficiency improves productivity and reduces
costs. In this way it reinforces capitalist growth imperatives, driving
the expansion of the economy which requires more energy to be used
overall]{.underline}.

This is also why progressive action on climate change will undermine
capitalism. [[We will only]{.mark} successfully [avoid catastrophic
climate change if we]{.mark} are able to [break the dominance of the
market, and break the social imaginary that ineffectually ties
fulfilment to consumption.]{.mark}]{.underline}

I would argue that within the base building movement, [the.re is a move
towards party organizing]{.underline}, but this trend has not always
been explicitly theorized or forwarded within the movement. [My goal in
this essay is to argue that [base building and dual power
strategy]{.mark} can be [best forwarded through party
organizing]{.mark}, and that party organizing can allow this emerging
movement to solidify into a powerful revolutionary socialist tendency in
the United States]{.underline}. [One of the crucial insights of the base

directly to this insight. By building institutions which can meet
people's needs, we are able to concretely demonstrate that
[communists]{.mark} can [offer]{.mark} the oppressed [relief
from]{.mark} the [**horrific** conditions of
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Base building]{.underline}]{.mark}
[strategy [recognizes that]{.mark} actually [doing]{.mark} the [work to
serve the people does **infinitely** more]{.mark} to create a socialist
base of popular support than electing democratic socialist candidates or
holding **endless** political education classes can ever hope to
do.]{.underline} Dual power is about proving that we have something to
offer the oppressed. The question, of course, remains: once we have
built a base of popular support, what do we do next? If it turns out
that establishing socialist institutions to meet people's needs does in
fact create sympathy towards the cause of communism, how can we mobilize
that base? Put simply: in order to mobilize the base which base builders
hope to create, we need to have already done the work of building a
communist party. It is not enough to simply meet peoples needs. [Rather,
[**we must** build the institutions of dual power]{.mark} in the name of
communism. [We must **refuse** covert front organizing and]{.mark}
instead [have a public face as a communist party]{.mark}]{.underline}.
When we build tenants unions, serve the people programs, and other dual
power projects, we must make it clear that we are organizing as
communists, unified around a party, and are not content simply; with
establishing endless dual power organizations. [We must be clear that
[our strategy is **revolutionary**]{.mark} and in order to make this
clear we must adopt party organizing]{.underline}. By "party organizing"
I mean an organizational strategy which adopts the party model. [Such
organizing focuses on building a party whose membership is formally
unified around a party line determined by democratic centralist decision
making. [The party model creates internal methods for holding]{.mark}
party [members **accountable**, unifying]{.mark} party [member
action]{.mark} around democratically determined goals, [and]{.mark} for
[educating party members]{.mark} in communist theory and
praxis]{.underline}. [[A communist organization]{.mark} utilizing the
party model [works to build]{.mark} dual power [institutions
while]{.mark} **simultaneously** [educating]{.mark} the
[communities]{.mark} they hope to serve.]{.underline} Organizations
which adopt the party model focus on propagandizing around the need for
revolutionary socialism. [[They]{.mark} function as the forefront of
political organizing, **[empower]{.mark}ing** local [communities]{.mark}
to theorize their liberation through communist theory [while organizing
communities to]{.mark} literally [fight for]{.mark} their
[liberation]{.mark}. A party is **not simply** a group of individuals
doing work together, but is a **formal organization** unified in its
fight against capitalism. [Party organizing has much to offer the base
building movement]{.mark}. [By working in a **unified party**, base
builders]{.mark} can [ensure]{.mark} that [local **struggles** are tied
to and informed by]{.mark} a unified national [an]{.mark}d
[international strategy]{.mark}. While [the **most horrific**
manifestations of capitalism]{.mark} take on particular and unique [form
at the local level]{.mark}, we need to remember that [our struggle is
against]{.mark} a [material base]{.mark} which functions not only at the
national but [at the international level]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
formal structures provided by a democratic centralist party model allow
individual locals to have a voice in open debate, but also allow for a
unified strategy to emerge from democratic consensus. [Furthermore,
[party organizing allows]{.mark} for local [organizations]{.mark} and
individual organizers [to be held accountable]{.mark} for their actions.
[It allows criticism]{.mark} to function not as one independent group
criticizing another independent group, but rather as comrades with a
formal organizational unity working together to sharpen each others
strategies and to help correct chauvinist ideas and
actions]{.underline}. In the context of the socialist movement within
the United States, such accountability is crucial. As a movement which
operates within a settler colonial society, imperialist and colonial
ideal frequently infect leftist organizing. Creating formal unity and
party procedure for dealing with and correcting these ideas allows us to
address these consistent problems within American socialist organizing.
Having a formal party which unifies the various dual power projects
being undertaken at the local level also allows for base builders to not
simply meet peoples needs, but to pull them into the membership of the
party as organizers themselves. The party model creates a means for
sustained growth to occur by unifying organizers in a manner that allows
for skills, strategies, and ideas to be shared with newer organizers. It
also allows community members who have been served by dual power
projects to take an active role in organizing by becoming party members
and participating in the continued growth of base building strategy. It
ensures that there are formal processes for educating communities in
communist theory and praxis, and also enables them to act and organize
in accordance with their own local conditions. We also must recognize
that the current state of the base building movement precludes the
possibility of such a national unified party in the present moment.
Since base building strategy is being undertaken in a number of already
established organizations, it is not likely that base builders would
abandon these organizations in favor of founding a unified party.
Additionally, it would not be strategic to immediately undertake such
complete unification because it would mean abandoning the organizational
contexts in which concrete gains are already being made and in which
growth is currently occurring. What is important for base builders to
focus on in the current moment is building dual power on a local level
alongside building a national movement. This means aspiring towards the
possibility of a unified party, while pursuing continued local growth.
The movement within the Marxist Center network towards some form of
unification is positive step in the right direction. The independent
party emphasis within the Refoundation caucus should also be recognized
as a positive approach. It is important for base builders to continue to
explore the possibility of unification, and to maintain unification
through a party model as a long term goal. In the meantime, [individual
[base building organizations ought]{.mark} [to adopt party
models]{.mark} for their local organizing. Local [organizations ought to
be building dual power alongside recruitment]{.mark} into their
organizations, [education of]{.mark} community [members in]{.mark}
communist theory and [praxis, and the establishment of]{.mark} armed and
[militant party]{.mark} [cadres capable of defending dual power]{.mark}
institutions [from state terror]{.mark}]{.underline}. Dual power
institutions must be unified openly and transparently around these
organizations in order for them to operate as more than "red charities."
Serving the people means meeting their material needs while also
educating and propagandizing. It means radicalizing, recruiting, and
organizing. The party model remains the most useful method for achieving
these ends. The use of the party model by local organizations allows
base builders to gain popular support, and most importantly, to mobilize
their base of popular support towards revolutionary ends, not simply
towards the construction of a parallel economy which exists as an end in
and of itself. It is my hope that we will see future unification of the
various local base building organizations into a national party, but in
the meantime we must push for party organizing at the local level. If
local organizations adopt party organizing, it ought to become clear
that a unified national party will have to be the long term goal of the
base building movement. Many of the already existing organizations
within the base building movement already operate according to these
principles. I do not mean to suggest otherwise. Rather, my hope is to
suggest that we ought to be explicit about the need for party organizing
and emphasize the relationship between dual power and the party model.
Doing so will make it clear that the base building movement is not
pursuing a cooperative economy alongside capitalism, but is pursuing a
revolutionary socialist strategy capable of fighting capitalism. The
long term details of base building and dual power organizing will arise
organically in response to the conditions the movement finds itself
operating within. I hope that I have put forward a useful contribution
to the discussion about base building organizing, and have dem

In North America, [[those who work]{.mark} for a living]{.underline}
have found themselves worse off year after year [[due to
capitalism's]{.underline}]{.mark} **incessant** [[drive for higher
profits]{.mark}. [Stagnant wages]{.mark}, [layoffs]{.mark}]{.underline}
to save the bottom line, [[attacks on]{.underline}]{.mark} immigrant
[[workers]{.mark}, [and increasingly precarious work hours are the

[North America,]{.mark} one that cuts across entire swaths of
industries, unions, and workplaces in continuation of the heroic history
of past general strikes of the North American working class that have
given our class the collective leverage to fight against attacks
affecting the whole working class. ]{.underline}

[[While productivity]{.mark} [(**i.e. the**]{.mark} **capitalist classes

50 years]{.mark}, [wages have remained stagnant]{.mark} and suppressed
through attacks on unions and the State's economic policy. This is
happening alongside the fact that the USA's imperialism, ruling class,
and capitalism in general is in a crisis that promises to only worsen.
[As this profit-driven system ]{.mark}]{.underline}of chaos
[[progresses, booms are]{.underline}]{.mark} seen and progressively

life has been extended through **imperialist war,**]{.mark} **[state

[which mean **attacks on workers and immiseration** for the working
class.]{.mark} As the crisis continues]{.underline} and deepens[, [the
capitalist class]{.mark}]{.underline} in order to maintain profit

The [current]{.mark} executive [management]{.mark}]{.underline} of the
interests of the ruling class, through successive governments
alternating between Democrats and Republicans, [[reflects this
need]{.mark}. [The result is **increasingly authoritarian action**,
**brutal nationalism, bigotry and violence**]{.mark} **against
transgender people and immigrants**, [and the **firing of tens of
thousands**]{.mark} of federal workers. [If Trump marks a

and the ruling class]{.underline} parties [adapt to it.]{.underline}

[Immigrant [workers **suffer**]{.mark}]{.underline} attacks [[as the
bourgeoisie seeks to]{.mark} further]{.underline} create and [[maintain
a **hyper-exploited** section of the the working]{.mark} class kept [in

[nationalist sentiment]{.mark} and avoiding the rightful placement of

the ruling class.

In the face of these general and widespread attacks by capitalism and
the capitalist class, [[the answer is not to turn to legislative

[who is **more close to the boss than the workers**]{.mark}. [We need

#### The people want a revolution 

**Arseneau \'21** \[Julien; 5/19/21; writer for In Defense of Marxism;
\"The class, the party and the leadership: How to organize revolution,\"
https://www.marxist.com/the-class-the-party-and-the-leadership-how-to-organize-revolution.htm/
\]

[[Capitalism]{.mark} has [**ceased** to take humanity forward]{.mark}.
It should long ago have been overthrown by the working
class]{.underline}. Why hasn\'t it then? The key to answering that
question lies in the role of leadership and of the revolutionary party.
This article, based on a talk at the 2021 Montreal Marxist Winter
School, looks at the different sides of this question and the rich
lessons of the world working-class movement.

The year 2020 has turned the world upside down. [[COVID]{.mark}-19 has
[exposed the]{.mark} complete [**bankruptcy** of]{.mark} the [capitalist
system]{.mark} in the eyes of **millions** of people.]{.underline} The
mantra that we are "all in this together" has been exposed for the lie
that it is. [All over the world, profits have come before needs. While
[millions]{.mark} of people have [lost]{.mark} their [jobs]{.mark}, the
rich are **richer** than ever. In the United States, the richest country
in human **history**, [millions]{.mark} of people [go]{.mark}
**[hungry]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

The economic crisis triggered by COVID-19 adds to what has been a lost
decade. [Since the previous crisis in 2008, [austerity]{.mark} has
[**ravaged** public services]{.mark}, workers have seen their real
[wages **stagnate**]{.mark} or fall, while [youth are]{.mark} the first
generation to be [**poorer** than their parents since
**W**]{.mark}**orld War II**.]{.underline}

It is on this basis that socialist ideas are making a comeback. [This
year, the Victims of Communism Foundation, which cannot be accused of a
favourable bias toward Marxism, released its annual survey and found
that [**49 percent** of]{.mark} 16 to 23-year-olds [(Gen Z) have a
favorable view]{.mark} of socialism, up nine points from 2019. Among
Americans **as a whole, that number** has [risen from 36]{.mark} percent
[to 40 percent]{.mark}. In the land of McCarthyism, 18 percent of Gen Z
think communism is a fairer system than capitalism!]{.underline}

These numbers are not as surprising as one might think. The younger
generation in particular has experienced nothing but austerity,
declining living standards, terrorism, imperialist interventions and
environmental destruction. [[The golden age]{.mark} of capitalism, the
1960s and 70s, [is **dead and buried**]{.mark}. [More people than
ever]{.mark} before [want to see]{.mark} the [revolutionary overthrow of
capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The [conditions are **ripe**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The reality is that [the capitalist system has]{.mark} long [been a
**brake** on]{.mark} human [development]{.mark}. It could have been
overthrown long ago by a **revolution** led by the working
class.]{.underline} Why hasn't this happened yet?

It is certainly not because the objective conditions to build a
socialist society based on super-abundance are lacking. There is no
doubt that from the economic point of view, all the conditions are there
to satisfy human needs. We have the means to feed the entire human
population. The technology and knowledge exist to produce the
necessities of life in harmony with nature. Large companies like Amazon
and Walmart show that it is possible to organize production and
distribution on a global scale. Many difficult or dangerous jobs could
be replaced by machines.

[Marx explained that [the]{.mark} capitalist [system "creates its own
**gravediggers**]{.mark}" by creating the working class -- the class
that builds the buildings around us, produces the consumer items we
need, and distributes goods and services]{.underline}. He also explained
that socialism was not just a good idea that appeared in the heads of a
few thinkers. [He showed that under capitalism, [it is the working class
that]{.mark} can [lead the struggle to establish a socialist
society]{.mark} by taking control of the means of production. Marx
explained that this class had to organize to overcome the resistance of
the bos ses, bankers, CEOs and their politicians. [This class]{.mark}
today (unlike in Marx's time) [forms the **overwhelming** majority of
society]{.mark}. [Once mobilized]{.mark} and determined to overthrow
capitalism, [nothing can stop it]{.mark}.]{.underline}

So why hasn't the working class overthrown the capitalist system with a
revolution yet?

Blame the workers?

Leon Trotsky, the leader of the Russian revolution alongside Lenin,
wrote a fantastic essay shortly before his death entitled "The Class,
the Party and the Leadership---Why was the Spanish Proletariat
Defeated?"

As the title suggests, the text looks at the Spanish revolution of
1931-39, and the reasons for its defeat. We will go into some of the
details of this revolution later. Suffice it to say for now that despite
numerous uprisings, spontaneous initiatives by workers to take control
of factories, and by peasants to take control of their land, despite
strong trade union organizations and a rich tradition of struggle, the
Spanish working class did not take power. A fascist regime led by
Francisco Franco was established in 1939, and lasted until the 1970s.

Trotsky's text, though short (Trotsky was assassinated before he could
finish it), is a gold mine of lessons, explaining such revolutionary
defeats -- and how to prepare for victories. This text should be
required reading for every socialist today.

"The Class, the Party and the Leadership" opens with a polemic against a
small, allegedly Marxist journal, Que faire? In one article, Que faire?
explained the defeat of the Spanish revolution by the "immaturity" of
the working class. If the Spanish revolution failed, then the fault lies
with the masses themselves.

This idea of blaming the masses is very common in the labour movement
today. Indeed, for many on the left, the fault lies with the working
class itself for not having already overthrown capitalism.

The working class is allegedly "too weak" to change the world. This was
one of the explanations of some leftists for the failure to complete the
Venezuelan revolution, which has been ongoing since the early 2000s.
Despite a historic mobilization during the 2002 coup, despite repeatedly
voting for Hugo Chavez's Socialist Party (PSUV), despite workers taking
control of their workplaces, and despite resisting further coups since
2019, there are still people who say the Venezuelan working class is too
weak.

For example, in "The Political Economy of the Transition to Socialism"
Jesús Farías, a leading member of the PSUV, stated, "We can say without
fear of being mistaken, that one of the main obstacles for a more
accelerated development of the social transformations in the country
lies in the organisational, political and ideological weakness of the
working class, unable to play today its role as the main motor force of
social progress."

Yanis Varoufakis, the former Greek finance minister in the 2015 Syriza
government, is another example of this trend. In a 2013 article,
amusingly titled "Confessions of an Erratic Marxist," he explained that
the crisis in Europe is "pregnant not with a progressive alternative but
with radically regressive forces." He was saying this just as the Greek
working class had staged 30 general strikes since 2008! Having no
confidence in the working class and seeing only the possibility of
"regression," he claimed that the only option was to create a broad
coalition "including right-wingers" in order to save the European Union,
and "save capitalism from itself."

Other journalists, intellectuals and supposedly left-wing personalities
say that the working class does not want change, and is not attracted by
a "left" program. This is the case with Paul Mason, a well-known British
left-wing journalist.

In Britain, hundreds of thousands of people enthusiastically joined the
Labour Party in the wake of Jeremy Corbyn, a self-proclaimed socialist,
becoming party leader in 2015. Since his 2019 election defeat, Corbyn is
no longer leader; the party's right wing has regained control under Sir
Keir Starmer, who has begun the dirty work of purging the party's left.

Mason, following Corbyn's defeat, argues that for the "traditional
working class" in Britain, certain "parts of the left's agenda turn them
off: open immigration policies, the defense of human rights, universal
welfare policies, and above all anti-militarism and anti-imperialism."
Universal welfare policies, how horrible! He adds, "Does it help tell a
story of hope to an electorate that has become terrified of change?"

So the problem here is that working people supposedly don't want
change---are terrified of change. The logical conclusion for Mason is to
support Keir Starmer, the moderate leader of the British Labour Party.
Mason has completely lost faith in the ability of the working class to
change society---assuming he ever had that faith.

What all these individuals express is the idea that it is the workers
themselves who are unwilling or unable to change society.

These ideas betray the fact that these people have no confidence in the
working class to make a revolution, to change society and to run it
themselves. These ideas are promoted by various journalists, liberals
and academics. However, they also infiltrate the labour movement through
the union bureaucracy. More often than not, union leaders blame the
workers they were elected to lead because the workers supposedly "don't
want to fight".

A crisis of leadership

How do Marxists respond to these arguments? Why hasn't the working class
overthrown capitalism yet?

[[The]{.mark} starting point for Marxists is the [**fundamental** role
of the working class]{.mark} [in changing society]{.mark}. Marxists have
nothing in common with the pessimism and cynicism of those intellectuals
and journalists who have contempt for the working class. [It is not true
that the]{.mark} working [class is "**too weak"**]{.mark} to overthrow
capitalism. The reality is that on countless occasions [over the last
100 years, workers have risen up]{.mark} to **overthrow** their
exploiters and change society. They've done everything in their power to
do so, on multiple occasions.]{.underline}

[But almost every time, it was the leaders of the workers' movement --
either of the unions or the workers' parties -- who put a stop to the
movement. They make compromises with the capitalist class, rather than
trying to take power. [**Dozens** of revolutions have been held
back]{.mark} in this way [by the leadership of the movement.]{.mark} In
his Transitional Program, Leon Trotsky correctly explains that "the
historical crisis of humanity is reduced to the crisis of
**revolutionary leadership**."]{.underline}

[However, **[we must]{.mark}** be careful [not]{.mark} to [fall
into]{.mark} a caricature of [this position]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Marxists do not defend the idea that workers are always ready for a
revolution, that they are simply waiting for socialist leaders to show
the way. To say that the leadership of the workers' movement acts as a
brake does not mean that if we had socialists at the head of the unions,
that if only we had a revolutionary organization at the head of the
workers' movement, then a revolution would break out immediately and
automatically succeed in overthrowing capitalism.

It is not true that the workers are always ready to fight and are just
waiting for good leaders[. A mass movement does not come about with the
snap of a finger. However, [history shows]{.mark} that there are
[critical moments]{.mark} in history [when the masses enter into
struggle]{.mark}: revolutions. The important questions for any activist
who wants to change the world are: how can we organize our class, the
working class, to overthrow capitalism? What is the role of socialists
to achieve this? How can we prepare for it?]{.underline}

Class consciousness

The class consciousness of workers does not evolve in a straight line.

It is through a long historical process that workers have come to
understand the necessity of organizing themselves. Trade unions were
created to defend the workers in the ongoing struggle against the
bosses. Eventually, workers created organizations, parties, to express
their political aspirations. Marx explained that without organization,
the working class is only raw material for exploitation. Through its
history of struggle, the working class comes to participate in politics,
through unions or other organizations. This process is uneven and
different from country to country.

Coming to the conclusion that it is necessary to organize is one thing;
coming to the conclusion that the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism
is necessary is another thing entirely. The working class, when it
enters into struggle, does not automatically come to revolutionary
conclusions.

In fact, consciousness is not revolutionary. Consciousness is generally
very conservative. People cling to old ideas, to traditions, to the
comfort of what is known. For the most part, people just want to be able
to live in peace under decent conditions. Who can blame them? No one
wants major upheaval in their lives. Workers don't take jobs to go on
strike.

Revolutions are inevitable exceptions in history. Workers are not
constantly in struggle; on the contrary.

[However, there are times when [the status quo is]{.mark} simply [no
longer **sustainable**]{.mark}. [Millions]{.mark} of people [are **fed
up**]{.mark}. Austerity falls on workers. The cost of living rises while
wages stagnate. [Public services are **privatized**]{.mark}. The rich
are getting richer, in plain sight.]{.underline}

[It is not revolutionaries who create great revolutions, but [the
**conditions** of capitalism]{.mark}, which [push the masses]{.mark}
[beyond]{.mark} the [limits of]{.mark} their
**[toleration]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Pictured are the millions
protesting in Cairo\'s Tahrir Square in 2011 / Image: Jonathan Rashad,

It is not revolutionaries or socialists who create revolutions. [It is
[capitalism]{.mark} that creates the conditions that [force millions to
**revolt**]{.mark}. Millions of workers, apathetic one day, are in the
streets the next day. Yesterday's consciousness, which was lagging
behind events, catches up with reality with a bang]{.underline}. And
that's when revolutions happen.

[[Very often, it is an "accident]{.mark}" that starts a
revolution.]{.underline} [The Arab revolutions of 2010-2011 started in
Tunisia when a young street vendor who immolated himself outside the
local governor's office. This was the spark [that **lit the
fire**]{.mark}. A mass movement followed, culminating in the overthrow
of the dictatorship in Tunisia. The movement then spread to Egypt and
then to the entire Arab world. The anger that had been building up for
decades just needed a spark. In almost every revolution, you can find a
similar event.]{.underline}

What is a revolution? Trotsky, in his History of the Russian Revolution,
explains it thus:

The most indubitable feature of a revolution is the direct interference
of the masses in historical events. In ordinary times the state, be it
monarchical or democratic, elevates itself above the nation, and history
is made by specialists in that line of business -- kings, ministers,
bureaucrats, parliamentarians, journalists. [But at those **crucial**
moments when the old order becomes no longer endurable to [the
masses]{.mark}, they [break]{.mark} over the **[barriers]{.mark}**
excluding them from the political arena, sweep aside their traditional
representatives, [and create]{.mark} by their own interference the
initial groundwork for a **[new régime]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Whether
this is good or bad we leave to the judgement of moralists. We ourselves
will take the facts as they are given by the objective course of
development. The history of a revolution is for us first of all a
history of the forcible entrance of the masses into the realm of
rulership over their own destiny.

This quote perfectly sums up the essence of a revolution. It is above
all the entry of the masses -- [today composed overwhelmingly of workers
-- onto the stage of history]{.underline}.

If we look at the last 100 years and more, there has been no lack of
revolutions. In fact, not a decade has passed without at least one major
revolution.

[Given the **ideological hegemony** of the bourgeoisie, the laws of
capitalism are **naturalized**, which is precisely why they are
perceived as the laws of nature. To Marx [there is **nothing** natural
about the laws of capitalism]{.mark} (Adorno 2007, 190, 354); they can
and must be abolished.]{.underline} However, some Marxian perspectives
on the ecological crisis are strongly influenced by Marx's belief that
[[capitalism will ultimately **destroy**]{.mark} the conditions of [its
own sustainability]{.mark}. What is less often mentioned is Marx's
insistence that [revolutionary action is the ultimate progressive way to
**abolish** capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline} Marx was not of the opinion
that progressives should sit idly by in anticipation of capitalism's
self-destruction. [For [the only force that]{.mark} can [set]{.mark} the
course of [history on a **progressive path** is]{.mark} the

forces** that have thus far shaped history hinges almost entirely on the
progressive will to act.]{.underline}

[What is certain is that global capitalism will not demolish itself in
order to prevent more catastrophes. John Barry explains that
[capitalism]{.mark} is parasitic in two ways, both of which [will lead
to its own collapse]{.mark}. First, capitalism is "parasitic upon the
non-capitalist social world"]{.underline} (Barry 1999, 263). As Marx
writes, [in a capitalist society those "who work acquire nothing, and
those who acquire anything do not work"]{.underline} (1986, 257).
[Second, capitalism is "parasitic upon the nonhuman world," that is, the
environment and the natural world more generally (Barry 1999, 263).
Because [capitalism is **driven** by]{.mark} the **[endless
accumulation]{.mark}** of capital, the natural environment is regarded
as nothing but an **exploitable** source of raw material and a space for
depositing industrial waste]{.underline}. Whatever can potentially
generate profit is exploited and transformed through manipulated labour.
[The result of [this is]{.mark} an [inevitable and
**ever-**worsening]{.mark} destruction of the ecosystem, all [while the
capitalist ruling class remains **fixated**]{.mark} on neutralizing any
threats to the production cycle [due to]{.mark} the
**[scarcity]{.mark}** of raw materials. [To overcome]{.mark} such
[problems, capitalists seek out more]{.mark} land, water, and air [to
**exploit**]{.mark}, contributing to the **catastrophic metabolic rift**
between humans and the natural environment (Foster 1999).]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--Alt\-\--AT: Loose Nukes

#### **No uniqueness\-\--pentagon cuts to funding ensure loose nukes in the status quo**

**Ling 25** (Justin, Freelance Journalist in The Star, Wired, Foreign
Policy, The Walrus. "Pentagon Cuts Threaten Programs That Secure Loose
Nukes and Weapons of Mass Destruction" WIRED. 3/6/25
https://www.wired.com/story/pentagon-cuts-nukes-chemical-weapons-wmd/)

[US [agencies responsible for preventing the global proliferation of
w]{.mark}eapons of [m]{.mark}ass [d]{.mark}estruction [and]{.mark}
building [security capacity]{.mark} around the world [are facing **deep
cuts**]{.mark}, perhaps total [abolition]{.mark}, [as]{.mark} the
[Trump]{.mark} administration continues its **[assault]{.mark}** on any
and all [spending]{.mark} going [overseas]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[According to a draft working paper provided to WIRED, [the
D]{.mark}epartment [o]{.mark}f [D]{.mark}efense [is asking all]{.mark}
its [agencies]{.mark} and services [that conduct "security
cooperation]{.mark}" programs [to consider the impact if]{.mark} the
[Pentagon were to "realign"]{.mark} its [funding]{.mark}. The authors of
the paper warn that the [cuts could **hobble** the fight against
organized crime]{.mark} in South America, impair the battle against the
Islamic State, [increase]{.mark} the [likelihood of a **rogue
state**]{.mark} producing and [using]{.mark} chemical [weapons, and
**defund**]{.mark} pandemic [surveillance measures]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The working paper is in response to a request for information from
Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, asking agencies to assess the
consequences of four levels of staff]{.underline} [reduction---25
percent, 50 percent, and 75 percent cuts, or [outright
**abolition**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[This [**cost-cutting** exercise is being conducted in response to
a]{.mark} January 20 [executive order]{.mark} from President Donald
Trump, [mandating]{.mark} that [departments and agencies review all
foreign aid programs]{.mark}.]{.underline} But the DOD review is going
well beyond foreign aid. [According to the working paper, [the]{.mark}
Defense [Department looks]{.mark} set [to make cuts to all humanitarian
assistance, security cooperation, and]{.mark} cooperative
**[threat-reduction efforts]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [The DOD has made
clear that all spending ought to align with the secretary's three
priorities: deterring China, increasing border security, and pushing
allies to shoulder more of the burden.]{.underline} It is not clear what
role, if any, Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency
(DOGE) is playing in these workforce reduction decisions.

Pandemics and Weapons of Mass Destruction

In response to the Pentagon's request for information, the agencies
contemplated lower bounds of cuts of 20, 40, and 60 percent---a
counter-offer, the Pentagon source says, because officials in these
agencies [see a [60 percent cut]{.mark} as a "red line" that
[would]{.mark} still [**severely** hurt]{.mark} global and domestic
[security]{.mark}.]{.underline}

A 20 percent reduction in funding, the memos say, would reduce some
mine-clearance efforts in former war zones, significantly hurt programs
to surveil and prevent infectious disease outbreaks in Africa, and
worsen biosafety and biosecurity programs at biological laboratories
worldwide, among other losses.

A 40 percent reduction would limit funding for counter-extremism
programs in Africa and the Middle East, close all mine-clearance
operations, shut down programs to intercept and prevent the development
of weapons of mass destruction, and completely shut down biological
surveillance programs.

[A [60 percent]{.mark} cut [would be significant]{.mark}ly more severe,
according to the memo. [It would **fundamentally eliminate** America's
role in preventing the spread of]{.mark} chemical, biological, and
nuclear [weapons]{.mark}, the documents warn, [and increase the
likelihood of]{.mark} a lab accident or **[theft]{.mark}** of
potentially dangerous biological material]{.underline}.

The secretary of defense also asked the agencies to game out the
consequences of fully shutting down some of their operations---a move,
the agencies claim, that would defund border security measures and
anti-drug-trafficking efforts.

[One of the agencies targeted by this spending review is [the Defense
Threat Reduction Agency]{.mark} (DTRA), which [leads
counter-proliferation efforts]{.mark} on chemical, biological, and
nuclear threats, both on its own and with US allies]{.underline}. In
recent years, DTRA took the lead on destroying chemical weapons in
Syria, helped secure 10 metric tons of highly enriched uranium in
Kazakhstan, and worked with the Ukrainian government to upgrade security
at its infectious disease laboratories.

[A Pentagon source tells WIRED that if cuts on the higher end of
[the]{.mark} proposed spectrum are made, [DTRA will **effectively
end**]{.mark}. "Anything more than a [60 percent cut cripples the
program]{.mark}," they say.]{.underline} The source, who requested
anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the spending
review, claims a total elimination of these programs is also on the
table.

[\"All [reductions increase risk]{.mark} to US due to pathogen spread
[and **easier**]{.mark} [adversary pathways to develop
WMD]{.mark},"]{.underline} the memos read.

The secretary of defense declined to comment for this story, with a
spokesperson writing, "We will not comment on internal deliberations."

The cost-savings of these cuts would be relatively marginal compared to
the Pentagon's \$850 billion budget. The Department of Defense only
spends about \$19 billion on humanitarian assistance, security
cooperation, and cooperative threat-reduction programs, including
DTRA---of that, the proposed cuts would eliminate between \$5 billion
and \$15 billion. Because many of these programs are funded via
congressional earmark, it's not clear the Pentagon has the authority to
cut and reappropriate their funding.

Trump and Hegseth have previewed defense cuts, promising to reduce
spending by \$50 billion---about 8 percent of the Pentagon's nonlethal
budget, Hegseth has said.

[These [cuts]{.mark} could also [have a **domino effect**]{.mark} on
other programs that are run in conjunction with the State Department and
other agencies. One long-standing project facing cuts under this review
is [the State Partnership Program]{.mark}, which sends National Guard
members to liaise and train with friendly militaries
abroad.]{.underline} This program has historically been particularly
popular with Republican members of Congress. [But it, like dozens of
other Pentagon activities, [faces]{.mark} steep [cuts or]{.mark}
**outright [abolition]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

A source with knowledge of the funding review says that a decision has
yet to be made about the exact level of these cuts, and that meetings
are ongoing to decide which agencies or programs will be hit and how
hard. A final decision is due in mid-April, at the end of the 90-day
window set out in the January 20 executive order. Sources inside the
Pentagon who work on security cooperation say they are fearful that the
cuts will be severe.

[The Pentagon's threat reduction efforts, and [the DTRA]{.mark} itself,
[stem from]{.mark} the [work]{.mark} of former US senators Sam Nunn, a
Democrat, and Richard Lugar, a Republican, [to secure w]{.mark}eapons of
[m]{.mark}ass [d]{.mark}estruction [after the fall of the Soviet
Union.]{.mark} America, through [their work, destroyed **thousands**
of]{.mark} ballistic [missiles and]{.mark} nuclear [warheads]{.mark},
disposed of tens of thousands of pounds of chemical weapons, and
dismantled Soviet bioweapon laboratories.]{.underline} In 1998, DTRA was
formally created and given a more expensive mandate to both track and
destroy chemical and biological threats while also helping other nations
do the same.

For its work, DTRA has been targeted by Russian disinformation efforts,
with Moscow accusing America of producing biological weapons in these
DTRA-funded labs. Following the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine
in 2022, conspiracy theorists in America picked up that thread,
suggesting the invasion was cover to destroy these bioweapons labs.

Fears about DTRA's work have since been raised by Health and Human
Services secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., director of national
intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and Russia itself. Republican senator Rand
Paul has repeatedly issued subpoenas to the DTRA looking for evidence
that it has been engaged in dangerous virological research and
suggesting that it may have had a hand in creating Covid-19.

"When Russia was attacking that program, it was doing so because it
wanted to erode our national security," Gronvall says. Russia may not
believe these lies, she adds, but "they have been enormously successful
in getting people with power to believe these things."

Last year, the United States accused Russia of using prohibited chemical
weapons in its war on Ukraine. According to this working paper, the
proposed cuts to the DTRA could eliminate America's ability to
investigate and attribute such chemical weapons attacks in Eastern
Europe.

[[Investigating and attributing]{.mark} these [attacks is]{.mark} a form
of **[deterrence]{.mark}**, Gronvall says. [Without this]{.mark}
capability, she adds, "it means [you're going to]{.mark} see a lot
[more]{.mark} chemical [weapons]{.mark} used."]{.underline}

The United States believes that Russia, North Korea, and other rogue
states have active biological weapons programs. Despite that, no state
has actually deployed a biological weapon since the adoption of the
Biological Weapons Convention. Gronvall is worried that dismantling the
DTRA could weaken that prohibition. "I would worry that that would be
something we would see," she says.

The working paper warns that reducing this funding could surrender
ground to Russia and China, which may try and fill the void left by the
US. That could see Moscow and Beijing move in to partner with foreign
militaries, cooperate with these biological facilities, and even recruit
new scientists.

"It's going to be a fire sale on expertise," Gronvall says, "and that is
helping China, 100 percent."

### 2AC\-\--Perm\-\--State Movements Good

#### When movements find success with the state, future movements are directed towards the state directly

scientist and Professor of Government at Harvard University, "Not So
Grassroots: Social Movements Fueled by the State", Harvard Epicenter,

**From the charismatic aura of Chairman Mao in Cultural Revolution China
to the anti-Semitism of state-sponsored protesters in Communist Poland
to nationalist movements of contemporary Russia, we see the convergence
of state messaging with prevailing popular dispositions among at least
some segments of the population. SMM strategies mimic independent
movements and organizations, with mutual borrowing of tactics and
technologies. Cultural and symbolic resources are critical and often
hotly contested (as with the Confederate flag waved by an insurgent
inside the US Capitol on January 6). [State-sponsored organizations may
hijack oppositional symbols and discourse to stir up historical memories
and mobilize ethnic and religious prejudices.]{.underline}**

**[States need not always undertake direct mobilization in order to
achieve their goals. [Often]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
[state]{.mark}]{.underline} (or elements of the state) simply
[[opens]{.underline}]{.mark} sufficient [[political]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} [[serves]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[state]{.underline}]{.mark} [[interests]{.underline}]{.mark}. We may
think of this as creating a conducive "political opportunity structure"
(to borrow the language of classic social movement theory), but here the
opening reflects a conscious technology of rule rather than an
unanticipated and unwelcome byproduct of elite division or state
weakness. Under these circumstances, [[states]{.mark} may
[facilitate]{.mark} the [emergence]{.mark} [of]{.mark} new
[movements]{.mark}]{.underline}. [States]{.underline} [may]{.underline}
[[also]{.underline}]{.mark} [[rely]{.underline}]{.mark}

[Some]{.underline} preexisting [[movements]{.underline}]{.mark}---such
as right-wing militias in the US---[[discover]{.mark} [common]{.mark}
[goals]{.mark} with elements of the state, [and]{.mark}
[mobilize]{.mark} on their behalf, but in a largely autonomous
way[.]{.mark} Others cooperate unreservedly with the state.]{.underline}
Yet these movements were not built by the state, nor are they financed
or directed by it. The result is an ever-changing field of state-society
interaction.**

**Overt [repression of civil society remains an option for authoritarian
regimes that deploy SMMs.]{.underline} The examples of China in 1968
(with the demobilization of the Red Guards) and again in 1989 (with the
repression of the Tiananmen Uprising) graphically demonstrate how
military suppression may proceed hand in hand with SMMs. Regimes vary in
whether they treat SMMs and coercive repression as complementary or
contradictory strategies for restoring order in moments of crisis.
Sometimes the two approaches are deployed simultaneously and reinforce
each other; other times, they are seen as tradeoffs, while in yet other
situations (when different elements of the state work at cross-purposes)
they may even undermine one another.**

**As states matured in experience and sophistication, t[he
[tech]{.mark}nologies [and]{.mark} [organizational
infra]{.mark}structure [of]{.mark} [state]{.mark}-[led]{.mark}
[mobilization]{.mark} [graduated]{.mark} from bureaucratic enforcement
and patronage networks to diffused techniques based on new communication
technologies and decentralized networks.]{.underline} Blatant state
propaganda and censorship have been superseded by public relations
strategies, electronic surveillance, and "astroturfing." Mobilization is
frequently less than transparent and based on a tactic of manufactured
ambiguity with regimes actively concealing state agency and purposely
blurring the boundary between state and nonstate sectors. The results
can be seen in the creative use of oppositional street tactics and
corporate-world techniques in the Nashi movement in Russia.**

### 2AC\-\--Cap Good\-\--Solves Poverty

#### Capitalism has only made poverty decline\--China proves

Rainer **Zitelmann**, ,6-1-**2021** Political News and Analyst About
Congress, the President, and the Federal Government, \"Is capitalism to
blame for hunger and poverty?,\"
https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/is-capitalism-to-blame-for-hunger-and-poverty//Msanchez

Most remarkably[, since the end of communism in China and other
countries in recent decades, poverty has declined faster than in any
previous period in human history.]{.underline}

[Many [people who believe that capitalism is to blame for hunger and
poverty have an entirely unrealistic notion of life in pre-capitalist
societies]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Johan Norberg, the author of
the book Progress, was himself an anti-capitalist in his youth. He
admits, however, that he had never really given much thought to how
people might have lived before the Industrial Revolution. He had
basically imagined this entire epoch of human history similar to a trip
to the countryside.

Fernand Braudel, the famous French historian wrote a definitive work on
the social history of the 15th to 18th centuries. People's diets, he
revealed, largely consisted of porridge, soup and bread made from
low-quality flour, which was baked in batches every couple of months and
was often moldy and so hard that it could only be cut with an axe. Most
people, even in cities, had to get by on 2,000 calories a day, with
carbohydrates making up well over 60 percent of the total. Food was
often nothing more than a lifetime of eating bread and bread again, or
mush and porridge. People back then were lean and small in stature --
throughout history, the human body has adapted to inadequate caloric
intake.

Some people rave about the harmonious pre-capitalist world, in which
everything was so "decelerated." This slowness, however, was mostly a
result of [**physical weakness due to permanent malnutrition**. It is
estimated that 200 years ago about 20 percent of the inhabitants of
England and France were not able to work at all. At most, they were only
strong enough to walk slowly for a few hours each day, which condemned
them to begging for their entire lives. The "possessions" most people
owned were limited to no more than a few items, as seen in contemporary
pictures: a few stools, a bench and a barrel that served as a
table]{.underline}. Even these descriptions only refer to Western
Europe, which was home to the small number of countries where people
were best off at the time.

I have described this in such detail here so that you can more fully
understand what it means when people say that [[**90 percent** of the
world's population were living in extreme poverty before the emergence
of capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}. In other parts of the world, living
standards were far worse than they were in Western Europe. The British
economist Angus Maddison, who specialises in analysing historical
economic data, used a series of complex calculations to estimate the
historic gross domestic product per capita for a range of countries
around the world. In 1820, this amounted to 1,202 international dollars
(a unit of measurement based on the year 1990) in Western Europe. The
figure is similar in other Western countries, such as North America,
Australia and New Zealand. In the rest of the world, however, GDP per
capita at the same time was only 580 international dollars, or about
half as much.

The impact of capitalism is evident from a longer historical comparison.
In the first year of our common era, GDP per capita in Western Europe
was 576 international dollars, compared to 467 international dollars for
the world as a whole. That means that in Europe, GDP per capita doubled
in the pre-capitalist period, between year 1 and the year 1820. In the
much shorter period from 1820 to 2003, GDP per capita in Western Europe
then rose from 1,202 to 19,912 international dollars and in the other
capitalist countries of the West it climbed as high as 23,710
international dollars.

But the same progress was not replicated everywhere. In Asia, for
example, in the 153 years from 1820 to 1973 GDP per capita only
increased from 691 to 1,718 international dollars. And then, in just 30
years, from 1973 to 2003, it rose from 1,718 to 4,344 international
dollars.

So what happened[? These incredible [developments in Asia are]{.mark}
mainly [due to the fact that Chin]{.mark}a progressively [introduced
free-market principles]{.mark} after Mao Zedong's death [in
1976]{.mark}. As late as [1981, as many as 88 percent of the Chinese
population were still living in extreme poverty; today it is **less than
one percent**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Never in world history have so many
hundreds of millions of people been lifted out of abject poverty and
into the middle class in such a short time.

[[Capitalism has done more to overcome hunger and poverty than any other
system in world history.]{.mark} [The most devastating man-made famines
over the past 100 years **all occurred under socialism**]{.mark} -- in
the 1930s alone, according to a range of estimates,]{.underline} between
five and nine million people died in the Soviet Union from famines
caused by the socialist collectivisation of agriculture.

### 2AC\-\--Alt\-\--AT: General Strike

#### General Strikes are too hard to amass, and to have them succeed.

**Bilboteach** 3/16/**25** (3/16/25, Community Daily Kos, Daily Kos, "A
General Strike? Why this is a HUGE Organizational Undertaking,"
https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/3/16/2309711/-A-General-Strike-Why-This-is-a-HUGE-Organizational-Undertaking#comment_90928033)
// CHIN

The Taft-Hartley Act was in response to the largest strike wave that the
United States has ever seen. It is estimated that between 4 million and
5 million individuals participated in a strike in the years 1945-46.
[[Strikes have seen declining participation]{.underline}]{.mark} ever
since --- except for a small boom in striking actions during Trump 1.0.

[[For a strike to succeed, there are quite a few conditions that are
necessary]{.mark}.]{.underline} I'm not saying strikers need to satisfy
all of these conditions but the more that are the better the chances of
success. Using the Red for Ed strikes as an example, here's why the
second biggest striking action this century in the United States worked.

1.  [[There needs to be nearly unanimous solidarity amongst workers in
    an industry]{.underline}]{.mark}. Otherwise, scabs and
    strikebreakers will continue producing the goods or services in
    question. Many tactics to discourage scabs are now illegal making
    solidarity nearly essential. I wasn't on board with Red for Ed (I
    was living rough in Arizona at the time) but enough people were on
    board that my lack of participation didn't matter.

2.  [[Public opinion needs to be on the side of the
    strikers]{.underline}.]{.mark} Red for Ed only worked because the
    parents supported it just as much as the teachers. The longer a
    strike goes on, the more support wanes for the strikers. Launching a
    PR campaign is another nearly essential step.

3.  Plan, plan, [[plan! Laborers in the industry need to know precisely
    what leverage they have and where to direct it]{.underline}]{.mark}.
    Knowing the weaknesses of the sector you work for is paramount. For
    instance, the fact that there weren't scabs available for teachers
    in the Red for Ed strike made a sick out strike very effective.

4.  [[Know the production chokepoints for your industry if you are
    producing goods]{.underline}]{.mark}. The article I linked to
    describes that the chokepoint in Big Food is loading and processing
    the great amounts of raw materials in the plants. A simple but
    successful strike involved refusing to unload hogs until conditions
    improved at the plant!

5.  [[Timing matters]{.underline}]{.mark}. Red for Ed would have failed
    if it happened at the start of the school year because people still
    had their summer child care arrangements as a possibility. Waiting
    until after spring break and before testing season was a high
    leverage point because child care services hadn't ramped up for the
    summer yet.  

[[Even with these five crucial conditions in mind, strikes are rare
because collective bargaining and even arbitration are preferable to
striking actions]{.underline}]{.mark}. As you are about to read,
[[strikes have a lot of problems to solve if they are to be
successful.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In a working paper published last month, [[Professor Gerhard Hanappi

[[Key red flags]{.mark} that the world is on a slippery slope to a

- [[democracies transitioning into increasingly

- [and the relentless widening of global inequalities.]{.underline}

[[These trends,]{.mark} some of which were visible before the previous
world wars, [are reappearing in new forms]{.mark}]{.underline}. Hanappi
argues that the defining feature of the current period is a transition
from an older form of "integrating capitalism" to a new form of
"disintegrating capitalism", whose features most clearly emerged after
the 2008 financial crisis.

For most of the twentieth century, he says, global capitalism was on an
"integrating" pathway toward higher concentrations of transnational
wealth. This was interrupted by the outbreaks of violent nationalism
involving the two world wars. After that, a new form of "integrated
capitalism" emerged based on an institutional framework that has allowed
industrialised countries to avoid a world war for 70 years.

[[This system is now entering a period of
disintegration]{.underline}]{.mark}. Previously, fractures within the
system between rich and poor were overcome "by distributing a bit of the
gains of the tremendous increase of the fruits of the global division of
labour to the richer working classes in these nations." Similarly,
international tensions were diffused through transnational governance
frameworks and agreements for the regulation of capitalism.

But [[since the 2008 financial crisis, wealth distribution has
worsened]{.mark}, with [purchasing power for the middle and working
classes declining as wealth becomes even more greatly
concentrated]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Growth in the Western centres of transnational capital has slowed, while
formerly sacrosanct international [[trade agreements are being torn to
shreds]{.mark}. This has fuelled a reversion to nationalism in which
global and transnational structures have been rejected, and 'foreigners'
have been demonised.]{.underline} [As [global capital thus continues to
disintegrate, these pressures escalate]{.underline},]{.mark}
particularly as its internal justification depends increasingly on
intensifying competition with external rivals.

While integrated capitalism depended on a transnational institutional
framework that permitted "stable exploitation on a national level",
Hanappi argues that "disintegrating capitalism" sees this framework
become disaggregated between the USA, Europe, Russia and China, each of
which pursues new forms of hierarchical subordination of workers.

[[Disintegrating capitalism]{.mark},]{.underline} he explains, [[will
resort increasingly to "direct coercive powers supplemented by new
information technologies" to suppress internal tensions, as well as a
greater propensity for international hostilities]{.underline}]{.mark}:
"The new authoritarian empires need confrontation with each other to
justify their own internal, inflexible command structure."

**Great power conflict**

Hanappi explores three potential scenarios for how [[a new global
conflict could unfold. In]{.underline}]{.mark} his first scenario, he
explores [[the prospect of a war between the three most prominent
military powers: the US, Russia and China.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[All three have experienced large increases in military spending since
the collapse of the Soviet Union]{.underline}. Despite a dip for the US
since 2011, [President Trump has ushered in a new spike, while Russian
spending]{.underline}]{.mark} [[has plateaued and Chinese expenditures
are rapidly increasing. All three countries have also experienced an
authoritarian turn.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Drawing on game theory, Hanappi argues that the calculus that [[none of
these countries would be capable of 'winning' a world war may be
changing in the perceptions of the leaderships of these
countries.]{.mark} By one estimate, [China has the highest probability
of survival at 52 per cent, followed by the US at 30 per cent, and
Russia at 18 per cent]{.mark}.]{.underline} This calculus suggests that
[[of all the three powers, China might be the most inclined to escalate
direct hostile military activities that challenge its rivals if it
perceives a direct threat to what it sees as its legitimate
interests.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Terrorism: The Developing Nuclear Security Regime,\" International
Journal of Nuclear Security: Vol. 7: No. 1, Article 17.

[Terrorism has always been a part of human history in various forms.
However, it had not been such a clear and present danger until the 9/11
attacks.]{.underline} [After the 9/11 attacks, terrorism evolved into a
new kind of terrorism only aiming to change a system with sensational
attacks that cause so many deaths. Today, it poses a threat in the form
of nuclear terrorism.]{.underline} Its potential rate of lethality could
not be compared with any other forms of terrorism if terrorists managed
to detonate an intact nuclear weapon or an improvised nuclear device. In
addition, [[the psychological effects of]{.mark} sabotaging a nuclear
facility or [exploding a **"dirty bomb"** would be]{.mark} much [more
**powerful** than any other form of terrorism]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
response, states have already started to cooperate through various
international responses, collectively known as nuclear security. But,
[[nuclear security is still developing and]{.mark} seems [**not yet**
strong enough to **effectively** cope with the threat of nuclear
terrorism]{.mark}]{.underline}. [On the other hand,]{.underline} [there
is the international nuclear nonproliferation regime based on the three
pillars of nuclear nonproliferation, the peaceful use of nuclear energy,
and nuclear disarmament.]{.underline} However, its scope is limited to
address threats stemming from traditional state actors such as nuclear
war and proliferation. Nonetheless, this regime still offers a useful
base for nuclear security to develop a more effective framework for
international responses to the threat of nuclear terrorism. The
inspiration and guidance of the international nuclear nonproliferation
regime would lead to more effective nuclear security. Introduction Since
9/11, there has been global concern about the threat of nuclear
terrorism and a terrorist's ability to cause mass casualties without the
use of a traditional weapon of mass destruction (WMD) \[1\]. [As
terrorist groups have already shown their willingness to cause maximum
damage, it would not be far-fetched for them to attempt nuclear
terrorism]{.underline}. Unfortunately, state-level-oriented efforts,
such as nuclear [deterrence, might not be effective in preventing these
terrorist groups \[]{.underline}2\]. Although the proliferation of
nuclear weapons is a relatively new problem, nuclear nonproliferation
efforts date back to the Cold War era \[2\]. After the Cuban Missile
Crisis in 1962, there was a need to push for stability and minimize the
possibility of nuclear weapon proliferation and nuclear war. Therefore,
concerns stemming from the possibility of the proliferation of nuclear
capabilities and the possibility of a nuclear war resulted in the first
steps of nuclear nonproliferation efforts, which have evolved into the
international nuclear nonproliferation regime, hereafter referred to as
"the regime." The cornerstone of the regime is the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty,
NPT) which entered into force in 1970 \[3\]. According to the NPT, there
are five nations recognized as nuclear weapon states (NWS). The NPT
differentiates between NWS and nonnuclear-weapon states (NNWS) that
agree not to manufacture, transfer, or seek assistance in acquiring
nuclear weapons or nuclear explosive devices either directly or
indirectly. While the NPT limits the number of states that own nuclear
weapons, it supports the peaceful use of nuclear energy for all parties
to the Treaty. Also, as a component of the regime, the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is "the world's central intergovernmental
forum," which concentrates on scientific and technical cooperation
concerning nuclear science and technology \[4\]. The IAEA serves for the
safe and secure use of nuclear technology and its peaceful use, which
supplements international peace and security. Similarly, covering all
multilateral arms control and disarmament efforts, the Conference on
Disarmament (CD) provides a base for treaties such as the Comprehensive
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty
(FMCT). Components of the regime, the Zangger Committee (ZAC) and the
Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), supplement the regime by providing
guidelines to ensure the peaceful use of nuclear materials. From a
similar point, [Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones]{.underline} (NWFZ) [reinforce
the regime]{.underline} [by creating a regional cooperation environment
carrying global values of the regime and being consistent with the NPT
Article VII.]{.underline} The regime is based on three pillars: nuclear
nonproliferation, the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and nuclear
disarmament. On the other hand, nuclear security is a newly developing
concept that emerged as a response to nuclear terrorism. By definition,
nuclear security is "the prevention and detection of, and response to,
theft, sabotage, unauthorized access, illegal transfer or other
malicious acts involving nuclear material, other radioactive substances
or their associated facilities." On the other hand, nuclear safety is
the prevention of "the broader issue of harm to humans (or the
environment) from radiation, whatever the cause" \[5\]. After the 9/11
attacks, nuclear security has become increasingly important. Especially
with former U.S. President Obama's Prague speech in 2009, nuclear
security has gained more publicity. [He highlighted the [threat
of]{.mark} nuclear terrorism by pointing out]{.underline} [[**black
market** trade, the spread of **nuclear tech**]{.mark}nology[,
and]{.mark} terrorists' [determination to acquire nuclear weapons or
nuclear weapons explosive]{.mark} devices \[6\]. As an act of nuclear
terrorism, [terrorists]{.mark} might [try to]{.mark} cause the
dissemination of radioactive materials through radiological devices or
cause a release of these materials by **[sabotag]{.mark}ing** [nuclear
facilities]{.mark}.]{.underline} Even worse, they might try to detonate
an intact nuclear weapon or an improvised nuclear device (IND) \[7\].
Although most terrorist groups might have different motivations and
intentions regarding the acts of nuclear terrorism, their capability to
do so heavily depends on technical and organizational skills and their
financial resources. Due to the threat, states have started to look for
ways of cooperation for nuclear security as a response to the threat
through different agreements and initiatives, such as UN Security
Resolutions, conventions, initiatives, and summits. Yet, nuclear
security efforts are in a stage of development and need comprehensive
attention on the threat of nuclear terrorism. In the case of a
successful nuclear terrorist act such as the detonation of an IND, a
major city could turn into radioactive debris, and an IND could cause
thousands of deaths and injuries. So, even the lowest probability of a
nuclear terrorist act requires the utmost attention to take nuclear
security steps \[8\]. In this vein, this article is an attempt to
briefly compare the fully developed international nuclear
nonproliferation regime and the developing international nuclear
security regime with a comparative approach by making use of regime
theory to come up with a solution to strengthen the latter in the midst
of the growing threat of nuclear terrorism. Accordingly, this article
briefly defines both regimes and then evaluates the different elements
of the nuclear security regime. After explaining both regimes, this
article uses a comparative approach to highlight how to benefit from a
developed regime by underlying the essential aspects of the regime. It
is imperative to note that while the nonproliferation regime is based on
a realistic and hegemonic mechanism for nuclear nonproliferation, the
international nuclear security regime is based on the sovereign
responsibility of the individual state. With this point of view, this
article offers a way forward by integrating these aspects into the
nuclear security regime in a relevant manner. II. International Regimes
Before moving forward with explaining the regime, it is helpful to
explain why international regimes are essential. International regimes
"constrain state behavior by formalizing the expectations of each party
to an agreement where there is a shared interest" in a given
international issue area. As a result, international regimes enhance
cooperative habits, oversee compliance, and sanction defectors. So,
international regimes encourage "trust, continuity, and stability in a
world of ungoverned anarchy" \[9\]. From this vein, "as a highly
developed example," the international nuclear nonproliferation regime
carries importance for studies concerning not only nuclear issues but
also any international regime. A. International Nuclear Nonproliferation
Regime The international nuclear nonproliferation regime is a universal
framework consisting of international agreements and organizations that
prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and strengthen the peaceful use of
nuclear energy, arms control, and disarmament process. In 1963, U.S.
President John F. Kennedy predicted that during the 1970s, there would
be fifteen to twenty-five states possessing nuclear weapons \[10\]. As a
result of such concerns, there have been several international
mechanisms to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy, prevent
nuclear proliferation, and provide a basis for nuclear disarmament, all
of which led to the establishment of the regime. The regime consists of
multilateral measures such as international export control, physical
security for nuclear material and weapons, border security to detect
illicit transfers, detection and interdiction measures, and arms
control, and the NPT constitutes the cornerstone of the regime \[11\].
Even though there is a misleading inclination to associate the regime
only with the NPT, the norms of nonproliferation have evolved thanks to
the implementation of the NPT and other relevant agreements and
organizations, such as enforcement and verification activities of the
IAEA, individual states, and the UN Security Council. The regime
reflects its importance through its success and evolutionary structure
\[12\]. The regime serves to guide political actions surrounding nuclear
issues. By this time, it has created principles, norms, rules, and
decision-making procedures according to which states shape their
expectations. 3 Alk??: Developing Nuclear Security Regime International
Journal of Nuclear Security, Vol.7, No.1, 2022 doi: 10.7290/ijns07e3t1
As a part of global governance, the regime covers other related
varieties of global governance, which consist of international rules and
laws, international mechanisms including IGOs and NGOs, international
norms and groups, and public-private partnerships. As a result,
international rules and laws, based on multilateral treaties and
customary practices such as the NPT and the CTBT (and possibly the FMCT
in the future), play a vital role in the regime's structure. These kinds
of laws are essential as "the negotiation process now involves all
affected countries." In addition, regional treaties of NWFZs supplement
these rules and laws, strengthening the regime. Similarly, as an IGO,
the IAEA provides a mechanism for states to shape international debate
on nuclear issues, monitors compliance, and creates norms of behavior.
These international norms are "shared expectations or understandings
regarding standards of appropriate behaviour." In a few words, all of
these rules, laws, international mechanisms, norms, and groups such as
the CD, the ZAC, and the NSG are linked under the international nuclear
nonproliferation regime. This is why the regime and international
regimes, in general, are "key types of global governance" \[13\]. In
addition to its general importance, the regime has a specific value for
this article's structure. This regime was a response to the threat
stemming from a traditional war perspective because it grew out of
necessity and peaked during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 to limit
the increasing risk of nuclear war between states and nuclear
proliferation. It has proved its success by limiting the number of NWS
and preventing a nuclear war up to now, as well as by increasing its
number of members and strength after the end of the Cold War. However,
war has become something new that takes state and non-state actors into
the equation. The security problem in the post-Cold War period is
dominated by the threat of terrorism. As a practical example of an
international regime, the regime could inspire nuclear security to
become more effective in preventing the threat of nuclear terrorism.
This reasoning is based on the premises of conventional war, where a
state that may not be as responsible as a great power might decide to
use nuclear weapons. B. Nuclear Security Regime As a response to the
threat of nuclear terrorism, states concluded several agreements and
launched various initiatives. These responses have intensified with the
effects of the 9/11 attacks and have achieved some success. From this
point, the existing nuclear security regime consists of international
rules and laws based on the UN Security Council resolutions, treaties,
and conventions, such as UN Security Council Resolution 1373 and 1540,
the CPPNM and its 2005 Amendment, Nuclear Terrorism Convention, and SUA
Convention and its 2005 Protocol. It also consists of groups, such as
Proliferation Security Initiative and Global Initiative to Combat
Nuclear Terrorism and Nuclear Security Summits, and norms and nuclear
security culture-building networks, such as the World Institute for
Nuclear Security (WINS), the International Nuclear Security Education
Network (INSEN), the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), and the
International Nuclear Security Forum (INSF). 1. UN Security Council
Resolution 1373 Immediately after 9/11, the UN Security Council
concentrated its efforts on counter-terrorism. As a result, on September
28, 2001, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1373, which created
proactive legislation to coordinate international efforts and counter
international terrorism that proved to have no limits on the level of
lethality and destruction. Resolution 1373 (2001) calls for member
states to prevent and suppress the financing of terrorist acts, refrain
from assisting terrorism, enhance cooperation against terrorism, and
become parties to international conventions and protocols (Paragraphs
1-3). The resolution highlights the connection between international
terrorism and transnational illegal activities, including the movement
of CBRN materials. It obliges states to cooperate "to strengthen a
global response to this serious challenge and threat to international
security" (Paragraph 4) \[14\]. 4 International Journal of Nuclear
Security, Vol. 7 \[2020\], No. 1, Art. 17 International Journal of
Nuclear Security, Vol.7, No.1, 2022 doi: 10.7290/ijns07e3t1 2. UN
Security Council Resolution 1540 The UN Security Council advanced its
counter-terrorism policies by adopting Resolution 1540 to pressure all
states to enforce the following provisions. Resolution 1540 (2004) calls
for member states to "refrain from providing any form of support to
non-state actors that attempt to develop, acquire, manufacture, possess,
transport, transfer or use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons and
their means of delivery" (Paragraph 1). It also requires member states
to review their domestic practices and laws to prohibit any non-state
actor from conducting any acts mentioned in Paragraph 1. (Paragraph 2).
Further, it calls for a member state to take effective measures to take
domestic control on related materials in production, use, storage, and
transport, to take effective border and export controls to prevent the
illicit trafficking of such items and to prevent WMD proliferation
(Paragraph 3). Like Resolution 1373, it establishes a committee, the
1540 Committee and Expert Group, to monitor compliance with the
resolution (Paragraph 4). The resolution also obliges member states to
promote the effectiveness of multilateral treaties related to WMD
proliferation (Paragraph 8) \[15\]. Like the previous resolution, this
resolution is also binding for member states. However, unlike Resolution
1373, it has direct obligations concerning WMD proliferation. Thus, this
constitutes an important step taken towards the nonproliferation pillar
of the regime \[16\]. Nonetheless, despite UN Security Council
Resolutions 1373 and 1540 bringing binding obligations to states, the
implementation, especially of Resolution 1540, has been slow for several
reasons, including shortcomings in the capacity to implement and
political unwillingness \[17\]. 3. Convention on the Physical Protection
of Nuclear Material (CPPNM) and 2005 Amendment As a result of the need
for cooperation between states to effectively protect nuclear materials,
in 1977, the Director-General of the IAEA prepared a draft convention
and sent it to all IAEA members. After more than two-year-long
negotiations on the draft convention concerning the physical protection
of nuclear materials, the Convention on the Physical Protection of
Nuclear Material was adopted in 1979, opened for signature in 1980, and
entered into force in 1987 under the auspices of the IAEA. The
convention states that it applies to nuclear materials used for peaceful
purposes during international transport (Article 2) and calls for
parties of the convention to take necessary steps to ensure the
protection of nuclear materials during international transport or during
the process of international transport (Article 3). It obliges parties
not to export, import, or allow transit passage within their territories
without receiving assurances to protect nuclear materials during
international transport (Article 4). Also, it requires parties to
cooperate in the recovery and protection of stolen or altered nuclear
materials (Article 5). The convention also calls for parties to
criminalize acts concerning unlawful possession, use, or threat of use
of nuclear materials (Article 7) \[18\]. The CPPNM has a limited scope
of international transport, as the opposing states supported the
domestic regulation of physical nuclear protection during the
negotiations. However, the threat of nuclear terrorism led to the
amendment process to expand the scope of the convention, which is the
only legally binding agreement on the physical protection of nuclear
materials \[19\]. The Amendment to the Convention on the Physical
Protection of Nuclear Material (2005) replaces the name of the
convention by adding "and Nuclear Facilities." Thus, the new title is
"Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and Nuclear
Facilities" (Paragraph 1). The amendment also replaces Article 2 of the
convention by expanding its application to both nuclear materials used
for peaceful purposes in use, storage, and transport to nuclear
facilities; and by affirming the responsibility of a state for physical
protection within that state (Paragraph 5). It requires parties to take
the necessary steps 5 Alk??: Developing Nuclear Security Regime
International Journal of Nuclear Security, Vol.7, No.1, 2022 doi:
10.7290/ijns07e3t1 to protect nuclear facilities against sabotage and
minimize its possible consequences (Paragraph 6). Similarly, it obliges
parties to criminalize the acts directed against nuclear facilities
(Paragraph 9) \[20\]. Apart from the Convention on the Physical
Protection of Nuclear Material and its amendment, the IAEA provides
legally non-binding recommendations as a booklet titled The Physical
Protection of Nuclear Material and Nuclear Facilities (INFCIRC/225)
\[21\]. There are several revisions to the booklet; the first revision
was published in 1972 \[21\]. The most recent was published in 2011
under the IAEA Nuclear Security Series with the title of Nuclear
Security Recommendations on Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and
Nuclear Facilities (INFCIRC/225/Revision 5) \[21\]. The recommendations
aim to guide states towards physical security for nuclear materials and
nuclear facilities. Similarly, there is also a Code of Conduct on the
Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources, which are also
not-legally-binding recommendations published in 2004 \[22\]. It applies
to all radioactive sources except the nuclear materials defined in the
CPPNM. The recommendations aim to achieve and maintain the safety and
security of radioactive materials, prevent the unlawful acquisition of
radioactive materials, and minimize radiological consequences \[23\]. 4.
International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear
Terrorism (ICSANT) In 1996, UN General Assembly Resolution 51/210
established an ad hoc committee aimed to prepare a convention for the
suppression of international terrorism, including a convention directly
addressing nuclear terrorism (Paragraph 9). After nearly a decade of
negotiations on the draft convention, the International Convention for
the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism (the Nuclear Terrorism
Convention) was opened for signature in 2005. According to the
convention, any person commits an offence if that person unlawfully and
intentionally possesses, uses, or threatens to use radioactive material
with an intent to cause damage, damages facilities with the same intent,
or attempts to do so; or participates in, organizes, or contributes to
such actions (Article 2). The convention requires parties to criminalize
these offences in their national law (Article 5). It calls for parties
to take practicable measures to prevent preparations of such offences in
their territories; to prohibit the activities of people, groups, or
organizations that contribute to the perpetration of such offences; and
to exchange information under the national laws and inform the UN and
the IAEA (Article 7). Also, it urges parties to take measures to protect
radioactive material consistent with the recommendation of the IAEA
(Article 8) \[24\]. The convention has a key role in establishing
nuclear security as an international norm. While it defines acts of
nuclear terrorism, it also promotes cooperation among states and the
IAEA to prevent such acts \[16\]. Similarly, Paige Willan states that
the convention has two aims: to criminalize the possession or use of
nuclear materials for acts of terrorism and enhance cooperation among
states to prevent nuclear terrorism. Further, she adds that the
convention creates norms for cooperation, including information sharing,
investigation, and prevention of such offences \[25\]. However, it is
pointed out that even though the Nuclear Terrorism Convention promotes
cooperation among states and with the IAEA and the UN, it is limited
cooperation because neither the IAEA nor the UN has been entrusted with
the role of monitoring compliance \[26\]. 5. Convention for the
Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation
and 2005 Protocol (SUA Convention) As a result of concerns related to
the safety of ships and the security of crew and passengers, the
International Maritime Organization was asked to prepare a convention
concerning the unlawful acts directed towards maritime navigation. These
concerns led to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts
Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation (SUA Convention), which was
adopted in 1988 6 International Journal of Nuclear Security, Vol. 7
\[2020\], No. 1, Art. 17 International Journal of Nuclear Security,
Vol.7, No.1, 2022 doi: 10.7290/ijns07e3t1 and entered into force in
1992. The convention aims to criminalize unlawful acts against maritime
navigation, including the seizure of ships by force, performing violence
against crew or passengers, damaging ships, or attempting or threatening
to do so \[27\]. However, there was a growing need for a revision in the
SUA Convention after 9/11, which led to the addition of the Protocol of
2005 to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the
Safety of Maritime Navigation \[28\]. According to this protocol, the
following is accepted as an offense: use of radioactive materials or
biologic, chemical, and nuclear (BCN) weapons against or on a ship;
discharge of these from a ship; use of a ship for intentional damage; or
transporting these and fissionable materials and equipment knowingly to
be used in or to contribute to BCN weapon or nuclear explosive activity
(Article 4, Paragraph 5) \[29\]. The 2005 Protocol carries importance
for nonproliferation efforts as mere transport of WMD, or related
materials and technology, is considered an offense. It promotes the
regime by not applying its provisions on a shipment of fissile
materials, which are regulated with the IAEA safeguards. In other words,
provisions are not applied to the shipment of fissile materials from or
to an NPT member state. While it prevents illicit shipments and other
malicious acts, it does not prevent the peaceful use of nuclear energy
through exports and imports \[26\]. 6. Proliferation Security Initiative
(PSI) The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) is a voluntary
partnership that launched in 2003, and it addresses the threat of WMD
proliferation. It provides a platform for states to coordinate their
activities for counter-proliferation. Being complementary to the
existing nonproliferation efforts and having one hundred and five
participant states, PSI aims to prevent illicit trafficking of WMD,
their delivery means, and related materials by coordinating the national
capabilities of participant states. Participant states commit to taking
the measures that are necessary for their national facilities to not be
used for such trafficking, and PSI participant states endorse the PSI
Statement of Interdiction Principles, thus creating an effective and
coordinated base for preventing WMD trafficking \[30\]. Despite its
non-binding structure, the PSI is seen as successful. There have been
more than two dozen WMD-related interceptions, among which the BBC China
was transporting centrifuge parts to Libya through the A.Q. Khan
network. Thus, its flexible and voluntary structure is complementary to
formal mechanisms \[31\]. Nonetheless, there are similar concerns for
the PSI as the NSS process. Because the initiative is seen as a
component of U.S. dominance by some states, some states also question
the legality of interdiction actions conducted through the PSI rather
than under the UN structure. As a result, they hesitate to participate
\[16\]. 7. Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT) The
Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT) is a voluntary
partnership established in 2006. Having 86 member states and five
international organizations as observers, the GICNT aims to integrate
available resources to enhance the global framework to combat nuclear
terrorism. It also aims to bring together nonproliferation,
counter-proliferation, and counter-terrorism experience and expertise to
constitute a ground for states to share information in a non-binding
environment \[32\]. It has an agenda called a Statement of Principles
comprised of objectives consistent with the UN Security Council 1373 and
1540, the CPPNM, and the Nuclear Terrorism Convention \[32\]. This is
why it creates no new international norms, organizations, or procedures.
Its voluntary structure creates flexibility for 7 Alk??: Developing
Nuclear Security Regime International Journal of Nuclear Security,
Vol.7, No.1, 2022 doi: 10.7290/ijns07e3t1 states, while its basis in
international agreements contributes to its legal standing. As a result,
it is possible to state, for the GICNT, that it reinforces international
responses and develops an informal environment to sustain them \[33\].
8. Nuclear Security Summits Former U.S. President Obama highlighted the
importance of nuclear security in his Prague speech and stated that "...
we should start by having a Global Summit on Nuclear Security" \[6\]. As
he stated, four Nuclear Security Summits (NSS) have focused on the
threat of nuclear terrorism and enhancing and promoting existing
mechanisms to prevent it \[34\]. The first NSS was held in Washington,
D.C. between April 12-13 in 2010 with 47 heads of state and three
international organizations participating. These leaders agreed to
provide effective security of nuclear materials, decrease weapons-usable
nuclear materials in civilian sectors, and strengthen nuclear security.
The summit issued a communique and Washington Work Plan that guided
enhancing nuclear security by ratifying or implementing treaties or
resolutions concerning nuclear security, thereby increasing assistance
and cooperation between states and the IAEA \[35\]. With the
participation of six new states and one new international organization
along with the previous 47 states and three international organizations,
the Seoul 2012 Summit had three main agenda topics: cooperative measures
to counter nuclear terrorism threats, protection of nuclear materials
and nuclear facilities, and prevention of illicit nuclear material
trafficking. Building upon the previous communique and work plan, this
summit also issued its communique in which it promoted minimization of
the use of highly enriched uranium (HEU), ratification of Amendment to
the CPPNM, and improving the security of nuclear materials \[36\]. With
the same number of participants as the previous one, the Hague 2014
Summit focused primarily on increasing the cooperation between states
and the nuclear industry and enhancing global nuclear security measures
\[37\]. In the communique of the final summit, which was again held in
Washington, D.C. in 2016, the overall process of NNSs was evaluated, and
the importance of nuclear security was reiterated \[38\]. It is believed
that NSSs strengthened nuclear security by promoting international
mechanisms and minimizing the use and amount of HEU and plutonium. The
NSSs played a key role in securing the necessary number of ratifications
for the Amendment to the CPPNM, which entered into force and was
announced at the last summit. With the commitments given in summits and
assistance of the IAEA, there were several accomplishments, such as
breaking the reliance on HEU in research reactor and medical isotope
production. Also, "several tonnes of HEU was repatriated to countries of
origin and down blended into LEU, several regions became completely free
of HEU" \[39\]. There are some criticisms towards the NNS process,
although there will be no new summits in this format. Even though the
main criticism is on commitments made during the summits, some of which
have not been accomplished, the summit process is also criticized for
focusing mainly on civil nuclear materials, which constitute
approximately 17% of the whole of weapons-usable nuclear materials.
There was a sense in some states during the NSS process that the U.S.
Government was using the threat of nuclear terrorism to preserve and
advance its strategic position \[39\]. 9. NGOs and Civil Society Efforts
The World Institute for Nuclear Security (WINS) is an international
non-governmental organization launched in 2008 whose objective is to
improve nuclear security globally by sharing information and practices
through an international forum. It also aims to develop effective
security systems and promote training for nuclear security
professionals. As it is stated in the WINS Governing Statue, WINS's
mission 8 International Journal of Nuclear Security, Vol. 7 \[2020\],
No. 1, Art. 17 International Journal of Nuclear Security, Vol.7, No.1,
2022 doi: 10.7290/ijns07e3t1 is to provide "an international forum for
those accountable for nuclear security to share and promote the
implementation of best security practices" \[40\]. WINS works in a close
relationship with the IAEA, and focuses on improving the security and
physical protection of radioactive materials and nuclear facilities by
sharing information and best practices. Accordingly, WINS has
coordinated the efforts of 5,300 members from more than 147 states to
share best practices to prevent nuclear terrorists from achieving their
aims \[41\]. Similar to WINS's activities, the network called
International Nuclear Security Education Network (INSEN) was established
under the auspices of the IAEA Nuclear Security Programme in 2010. The
network aims to promote nuclear security through nuclear security
education. Having an informal membership status, INSEN supports the
development of peer-reviewed textbooks, training, and research programs
on nuclear security \[42\]. Therefore, it plays a key role in developing
nuclear security culture. There are other initiatives and civil society
efforts contributing to the current nuclear security regime. One of
these is the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), which cooperates with
governments and organizations to increase awareness and offer creative
solutions. The NTI aims to build a safer and more secure world through
collaboration and action as an independent initiative. The International
Nuclear Security Forum (INSF) is another essential platform that creates
opportunities to collaborate and share experiences among its members,
provides educational support for different stakeholders, and promotes
information sharing concerning nuclear security. In addition, INSF
supports nuclear security implementation and promotes nuclear security
leadership intending to reduce the threat of nuclear terrorism. In this
vein, it creates an international platform for international experts to
identify, create, and reinforce nuclear security strategies. As seen
through the above-mentioned state and non-state responses to the threat
of nuclear terrorism, states have started to cooperate against it. These
steps constitute the structure of the nuclear security regime which will
develop in time, like the regime. However, unlike regime components,
most of these international responses are voluntary and offer legally
non-binding recommendations while there are insufficient or no
mechanisms to monitor compliance which, in return, cause vulnerabilities
to be exploited. Also, there are no comprehensive nuclear security
standards, which means the absence of developed norms and culture. Yet,
this does not necessarily mean that the nuclear security regime does not
exist at all. In fact, what is needed for an effective nuclear security
regime are developed norms, culture, and status for participating
states, which are in development. Increased awareness of the threat of
nuclear terrorism also plays an important role in the effectiveness of
the nuclear security regime. III. Proposed Approach to the Nuclear
Security Regime [Various mechanisms have been formulated to cope with
the threat of WMD terrorism,]{.underline} which has occupied a prominent
place on the international security agenda since the 9/11 attacks. In
this regard, UN Security Resolution 1373 (2001) brings legally binding
responsibilities for all UN member states to address the threat of
terrorism to prevent terrorists from acquiring CBRN material. Likewise,
UN Security Resolution 1540 (2004) aims to prevent the acquisition of
WMD by terrorists. In addition, the PSI and the SUA Convention offer
important solutions for counter-proliferation by preventing the transfer
of material. Apart from these attempts, CPPNM and its 2005 Amendment and
the Nuclear Terrorism Convention enhance the physical protection of
nuclear material and facilities and criminalize actors of nuclear
terrorism, respectively. Both conventions also promote cooperation
between states for the prevention of nuclear terrorism. Similarly, the
GICNT provides a voluntary partnership to unite different resources
against nuclear terrorism while providing an informal environment to
sustain the attempts mentioned above. In addition to contributing to the
awareness of the threat of nuclear terrorism, Nuclear Security Summits,
WINS, INSEN, NTI and INSF promote nuclear security and develop nuclear
security culture by increasing awareness through high-level statesmen,
professionals, and academics. [However, as Mustafa Kibaroğlu states,
"[there are no comprehensive standards of **nuclear security**]{.mark}
that states must follow, [nor]{.mark} are there international
[transparency mechanisms]{.mark} that would depend on the nuclear
security efforts of individual states. [This creates **vulnerabilities**
that could be exploited by]{.mark} capable smugglers or [terrorist
groups"]{.mark}]{.underline} \[43\]. Similarly, Nilsu Gören states that
"the day-to-day implementation of the technical, legal, and regulatory
aspects of nuclear security remains as the biggest challenge since the
security of nuclear materials is not on high priority of governments
everywhere" \[44\]. Thus, it makes it difficult for states to apply
effective nuclear security measures. Because there are neither
international standards nor independent mechanisms that would ensure
that every state fulfils their nuclear security responsibilities.
Moreover, there is no consensus among states on the importance of
nuclear security or the credibility of the threat of nuclear terrorism.
Additionally, the lack of political will impairs the effectiveness of
the existing nuclear security efforts. For instance, Russia, having the
largest stocks of HEU and plutonium, had been suspicious about the U.S.
leadership of the NSS process. Russia perceived the threat of nuclear
terrorism as a tool of the U.S. national interest for preserving and
advancing their strategic position. As a result of deteriorating
relations with the West after the Ukraine crisis in 2014, Moscow drew
away from the NSS process \[39\]. Similarly, there is also an argument
that the NSS process reflected the U.S. national interests since the
U.S. Government did not count some states in this process, such as
Belarus, Iran, North Korea, and some other states with a considerable
amount of HEU \[39\]. Other countries have other concerns with existing
nuclear security efforts. India, Pakistan, and other few states, such as
New Zealand, Peru, and South Africa, claim that the UN Security Council
acted out of its scope to enforce generic provisions of Resolution 1540
without referring to a concrete security threat \[17\]. Similarly, China
and a few other states, such as Indonesia and Malaysia, criticize the
PSI process and its legality, which operates outside the UN framework
and reject joining there \[16\]. As a result, these issues raise the
question of political will related to the national interest.
Consequently, such state behavior falls in the domain of Realism and its
strands which prioritize survival, self-help, and struggle for power in
a world of anarchy and accept limited or no cooperation in international
relations. However, even though these seem to approve Realist
explanations, this article argues that Regime Theory serves mutual
interests by offering solutions for common problems such as the threat
of nuclear terrorism. Also, Regime Theory clarifies the question of
leadership which it accepts as a position for facilitating joint
interest maximization. From this point, international regimes cover all
other pieces of global governance and principles, norms, rules, and
decision-making procedures. As a successful example of the international
regimes, the regime minimizes the traditional state-level threat of
nuclear war and further proliferation while promoting the peaceful use
of nuclear energy and nuclear disarmament by creating, developing, and
sustaining norms, rules, decision-making procedures, and culture, as
well as granting status to participating states. In addition, with five
NWS assuming the leadership of the process, this regime improves itself
by evolving according to the circumstances, as in the case of Review
Conferences (RevCons) and the Additional Protocol (AP), to eliminate
dysfunctional or insufficient sides. Therefore, it presents a good
example of an international regime to inspire similar international
efforts. 10 International Journal of Nuclear Security, Vol. 7 \[2020\],
No. 1, Art. 17 International Journal of Nuclear Security, Vol.7, No.1,
2022 doi: 10.7290/ijns07e3t1 Table 1. Pieces of Global Governance and
International Regimes To strengthen the existing nuclear security regime
and minimize the threat of nuclear terrorism, this article suggests that
[the existing nuclear security regime should have all pieces of an
international regime, fully developed norms, and nuclear security
culture]{.underline}. This means that an international organization that
sets comprehensive nuclear security standards and violations would
monitor the implementation of applicable international rules and laws.
In addition, there would be more groups and new NGOs that would cover
all aspects of nuclear security-related issues. These would be enhanced
through developed norms and nuclear security culture, which would give a
sense of belonging and status for the participating states and motivate
them. Increased awareness would also promote these steps by leading
states to take necessary action against global security threats. Then,
such a nuclear security regime would create more expectations for member
states that share a mutual interest in preventing nuclear terrorism.
This would also ease the question of leadership and political
unwillingness. It would enhance cooperative habits, oversee compliance,
and sanction defectors, which are key missing elements of the current
nuclear security regime. Most importantly, this regime would encourage
trust, continuity, and stability for international responses to the
threat of nuclear terrorism. This would lead more states to participate
in these international responses because it would motivate states
through norms and principles and give them a sense of belonging and
status. As the most notable example of international regimes, the
international nuclear nonproliferation regime can and would inspire
nuclear security regime. The regime and its mechanisms to implement and
monitor its provisions have improved through time, principles, norms,
rules, and decision-making procedures. In contrast, the nuclear security
regime still needs time to be fully developed. By building on these
developed norms and status of the regime, which are the responsibilities
of NWS and NNWS to implement safeguards and disarmament, the nuclear
security regime can develop and sustain its norms and status for the
threat that dominated the post-Cold War period. These would be becoming
a member of concerning treaties and conventions and fulfilling the
responsibilities stemming from these treaties and conventions.
Additionally, as norms and principles are the elements that lead states
to abandon individual decisionmaking processes for common problems,
nuclear security norms and status would contribute to the rapid
development of nuclear security culture by increasing both awareness of
the threat and effectiveness of the nation-level regulations and
activities. At this point, elements of popular culture such as films and
TV series are critical to raising awareness and the development of
nuclear security culture without causing panic \[44\]. The NSS has
already increased awareness of the threat (at the governmental level,
mostly) Regime Theory International Nuclear Nonproliferation Regime

10.7290/ijns07e3t1 through the discourse used by prominent world leaders
during summits, such as the Washington, D.C. summits in 2010 and 2016,
the Seoul summit in 2012, and the Hague summit in 2014. Yet, in the
shadow of knowing that there would be no new NSS at this level,
education and communication would be the leading element in increasing
awareness. These steps would help the nuclear security regime alleviate
self-interested calculations, lack of awareness, and the lack of a
universal definition of terrorism, as well as promote itself as a more
effective international regime. In this case, where the regime would
inspire the nuclear security regime, the IAEA might get the ultimate
authority for comprehensive nuclear security standards, as in the case
of nuclear safety and safeguards. Thereby, the IAEA would have the
authority to develop, improve, and verify nuclear security standards,
implement them, and monitor states' compliance. Similar to the
safeguards, there would be "guidelines" or "best practices" for nuclear
security, which could be shared through the IAEA. Like RevCons, which is
an example of the evolutionary side of international regimes, there
would be review conferences for CPPNM and ICSANT to discuss and bring
solutions for problems with the nuclear security regime, international
law, and the process of negotiation of which involves all affected
countries. Therefore, an international nuclear security regime inspired
by the regime would offer solutions for most of the current nuclear
security problems by creating, developing, and sustaining principles,
norms, rules, and decisionmaking procedures. Most importantly, as the
threat of nuclear terrorism is a global threat, its responses should
also be global. Yet, regional steps to create and develop standards and
compliance measures on nuclear security would support the existing
nuclear security regime, of which legal foundation could be accelerated
with wider participation in existing international efforts. Then, such
an international regime would bring all states together to respond to
the most important threat to global security because this regime would
address more states than any of the nuclear security efforts addressed
alone. This suggestion aims to provide a framework in which nuclear
security becomes comprehensive and, as a result, could become more
effective. Because terrorism has always evolved into deadlier forms, the
next step might be a nuclear one. Along with its huge potential
physical, physiological, and financial destruction, this would create a
new wave of terrorism. Therefore, [states need to cooperate for a
comprehensive nuclear security regime before a "nuclear 9/11"
happens]{.underline}. At this point, any further study on Chinese and
Russian views and other states' views on nuclear terrorism and nuclear
security would be an important contribution to nuclear security studies.
Similarly, future studies on technical requirements for various methods
of nuclear terrorism would also be helpful to have a better threat
assessment and make it easier to understand how even the smallest amount
of radioactive materials could be used for malicious actions. These
would increase awareness of the threat and promote existing nuclear
security efforts. [[Terrorism continues to be a threat]{.mark} as it has
always been.]{.underline} [[It evolves into new forms]{.mark}, and [its
**indiscriminative** nature improves in every new
form]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Nuclear terrorism might be the **next
step**]{.underline}]{.mark} because its potential lethality rate would
not be compared with any other forms of terrorism if terrorists managed
to detonate an intact nuclear weapon or an IND. Similarly, even though
sabotaging a nuclear facility or exploding a dirty bomb would not cause
a huge destruction, the psychological effects of sabotage or a dirty
bomb would be much more powerful on the target audience than any other
form of terrorism. Therefore, states should enhance nuclear security
efforts to prevent terrorists from achieving their aims with nuclear
terrorism. Even though states have already started to cooperate against
the threat of nuclear terrorism through several conventions and
initiatives, nuclear security needs comprehensive attention to be more
effective. At this point, current international responses to the threat
of nuclear terrorism and nuclear security culture are at the stage of
development. And, as a global threat to global security, the threat of
nuclear terrorism requires a global solution. However, current
international responses to the threat of nuclear terrorism cannot appeal
to some states that either lack political will or are unaware of the
urgency of the threat. In addition, there is no mechanism to monitor the
implementation and compliance of the current international efforts.

[Making matters worse, [there is]{.mark} evidence of [an **illicit
market**]{.mark} for nuclear weapons-usable materials. [There are
sellers in search of]{.mark} potential [buyers]{.mark}, as shown by the
dismantlement of a nuclear smuggling network in Moldova in 2015.
[There]{.mark} certainly [are]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**plenty of
sites**]{.mark} from which [to obtain nuclear
material]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to the 2016 Nuclear Security
Index by the Nuclear Threat Initiative, 24 countries still host
inventories of nuclear weapons-usable materials, stored in facilities
with different degrees of security. [And in terms of risk, it is not
necessary for a given country to possess nuclear **weapons**,
weapons-usable materials, or nuclear facilities for it to be useful to
nuclear terrorists: Structural and institutional weaknesses in a country
may make it favorable for the **illicit trade** of materials. Permeable
boundaries, high levels of corruption, weaknesses in judicial systems,
and consequent impunity may give rise to a series of
**[transactions]{.mark}** and other events, which could [**end**
in]{.mark} a **[nuclear attack]{.mark}**. The truth is that, at this
stage, **[no country]{.mark}** in possession of nuclear weapons or
weapons-usable materials [can guarantee]{.mark} their [full protection
against]{.mark} nuclear [terrorism]{.mark} or nuclear smuggling. Because
we live in a world of growing insecurity, where explicit and tacit
agreements between the relevant powers -- which upheld global stability
during the post- Cold War -- are giving way to increasing **mistrust**
and hostility, a question arises:]{.underline} How would our lives be
affected if a current terrorist group such as the Islamic State (ISIS),
or new terrorist groups in the future, succeed in evolving from today's
Manchester style "low-tech" attacks to a "high-tech" one, involving a
nuclear bomb, detonated in a capital city, anywhere in the world? We
attempted to answer this question in a report developed by a high-level
multidisciplinary expert group convened by the NPSGlobal Foundation for
the Latin American and Caribbean Leadership Network. We found that there
would be multiple harmful effects that would spread promptly around the
globe (Arguello and Buis 2016); a more detailed analysis is below, which
highlights the need for the creation of a comprehensive nuclear security
system. [The consequences of a terrorist nuclear attack [A
**small**]{.mark} and **[primitive]{.mark}** 1-kiloton **[fission
bomb]{.mark}** (with a yield of about one-fifteenth of the one dropped
on Hiroshima, and certainly much less sophisticated; cf. Figure 1),
detonated [in any]{.mark} large [capital]{.mark} city of the developed
world, [would cause an **unprecedented catastrophic
scenario**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} An estimate of direct effects
in the attack's location includes a death toll of 7,300-to-23,000 people
and 12,600-to-57,000 people injured, depending on the target's geography
and population density[. Total physical destruction of the city's
infrastructure, due to the blast (shock wave) and thermal radiation,
would cover a radius of about 500 meters from the point of detonation
(also known as ground zero), while ionizing radiation greater than 5
Sieverts -- compatible with the deadly acute radiation syndrome -- would
expand within an 850-meter radius]{.underline}. From the environmental
point of view, such an area would be unusable for years. [In addition,
radioactive fallout would expand in an area of about 300 square
kilometers, depending on meteorological conditions (cf. Figure 2). [But
the consequences would go **far beyond**]{.mark} the effects in [the
target country]{.mark}, however, [and]{.mark} promptly [**propagate
worldwide**. **Global**]{.mark} and national [**security**,]{.mark}
**economy** and **finance**, international **governance** and its
framework, national **politic**al system**s**, and the behavior of
governments and individuals [would]{.mark} all [be put under severe
trial]{.mark}]{.underline}. The severity of the effects at a national
level, however, would depend on the countries' level of development,
geopolitical location, and resilience. Global security and
regional/national defense schemes would be strongly affected. [An
increase in **[global distrust]{.mark}** \[\[FIGURE 3 OMITTED\]\] would
[spark rising **tensions among countries**]{.mark} and **blocs**, [that
could]{.mark} even [lead to]{.mark} the brink of **[nuclear weapons use
by states]{.mark}** (if, for instance, a sponsor country is identified).
The consequences of such a shocking scenario would include a decrease in
states' self-control, an **escalat**ion of **present conflicts** and the
emergence of **new ones**, accompanied by an increase in **military
unilat**eralism and military expenditures]{.underline}. Regarding the
economic and financial impacts, a severe global economic depression
would rise from the attack, likely lasting for years. Its duration would
be strongly dependent on the course of the crisis. The main results of
such a crisis would include a 2 percent fall of growth in global Gross
Domestic Product, and a 4 percent decline of international trade in the
two years following the attack (cf. Figure 3). [In the case of
developing and less-developed countries, the economic impacts would also
include a shortage of high-technology products such as **medicines**, as
well as a fall in foreign direct investment and a severe decline of
international humanitarian aid toward low-income countries. We expect an
increase of **unemployment** and **poverty** in all countries. Global
poverty would raise about 4 percent after the attack, which implies that
at least 30 million more people would be living in extreme poverty, in
addition to the current estimated 767 million]{.underline}. In the area
of international relations, we would expect a breakdown of key doctrines
involving politics, security, and relations among states. [These
**international tensions** could lead to a **collapse of the nuclear
order** as we know it today, with a consequent setback of nuclear
disarmament and nonproliferation commitments. In other words, the whole
system based on the Nuclear **N**on- **P**roliferation **T**reaty would
be put under **severe trial**. After the attack, there would be a
**reassess**ment of existing security doctrines, and a deep review of
concepts such as nuclear **deterrence**, no-firstuse, proportionality,
and negative security assurances.]{.underline}
