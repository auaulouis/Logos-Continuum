[The story of the Energy DA:]{.underline}

Uniqueness -- the fossil fuel industry is strong, strong investments in
it now

Link -- the plan creates a seismic departure from the status quo that
reduces fossil fuel demand (either by increasing renewables,
geoengineering, nuclear power via FNPPs, etc.)

Internal Link + Impact -- Reducing fossil fuel demand destroys the
fossil fuel industry (profits, investments) which is bad for things like
energy security, the economy, or the agriculture industry.

It is meant to be read against these affirmatives at camp so far: FNPPs,
Geoengineering (multiple versions)

Accessed: 7/14/25)

**[The [world's biggest banks]{.mark} continue to [bankroll]{.mark} the
[expansion of]{.mark} the [fossil fuel industry]{.mark} and have largely
retreated from their climate commitments]{.underline}**, even as the
world heads toward breaching thresholds for a livable planet.

**[A new report from a coalition of environmental and banking advocacy
groups, published Tuesday, finds that the [world's]{.mark} 65 [biggest
banks committed \$869 billion to fossil fuels]{.mark} companies
[in]{.mark} 20[24]{.mark}---a jump of \$162 billion over 2023. A big
chunk of that---[\$429 billion]{.mark}---went [to companies that
have]{.mark} specific [plans to expand their development]{.mark} of
fossil fuels.]{.underline}**

The report looks in detail at the years since 2021, when scientists with
the International Energy Agency (IEA) said fossil fuel expansion
effectively had to stop in order to meet global climate targets.

"The \[IEA\] put out a very comprehensive study that looked at the
energy roadmap for getting to net-zero emissions by 2050 globally," said
Allison Fajans-Turner, a researcher with the Rainforest Action Network
and a co-author of the report. "One of the major findings was there was
no room for any upstream, midstream or downstream fossil fuel
infrastructure to be built, burned or combusted if we are serious about
limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees. **[[Since then]{.mark},
unfortunately, we've seen [banks put \$1.6 trillion into fossil fuel
expansion]{.mark}."]{.underline}**

**[American banks are leading the pack, the new report finds. JPMorgan
Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup are the top three financial
supporters of fossil fuel companies globally. Along with Wells Fargo,
which ranks fifth after the Japanese bank Mizuho, these [four banks
represent more than 20 percent of]{.mark} total [global fossil fuel
financing]{.mark}, the report found.]{.underline}**

The analysis, by the Banking on Climate Chaos coalition, draws on
financial databases used by the banking industry and from annual company
reports, stock filings and presentations. It looks at roughly 2,700
companies engaged in fossil fuel development or distribution.

[**The [\$162 billion jump]{.mark} from 2023 to 2024 [reverses]{.mark} a
[downward trend]{.mark} that was caused by a combination of factors, the
authors say. Energy prices increased following [Russia's
invasion]{.mark} of Ukraine, [boost]{.mark}ing the [fossil fuel
industry's profits]{.mark}** and decreasing its need for financing and
loans]{.underline}. Since then, central banks' interest rate cuts have
made [loans cheaper and more attractive]{.underline}, potentially
prompting banks to borrow more. 

The broader political climate could also be a factor, as regulators,
including those in the **[[U.S., retreat on climate
rules]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The Securities and Exchange Commission
decided to drop its pursuit of climate disclosure rules in March.

"It's a [combination of factors---some political, some market-based and
some really successful campaigning by the fossil fuel
industry]{.underline} on anti-ESG," said Jessye Waxman, a researcher
with the Sierra Club, who was one of the new report's authors. 

**[The [global expansion of]{.mark} liquified natural gas [(LNG)]{.mark}
is [also a factor]{.mark}. "We know that we're seeing one of [the
biggest fossil fuel build-out in the LNG sector]{.mark}]{.underline}**,"
said Caleb Schwartz, also with the Rainforest Action Network and an
author of the report. "We can point to the gulf in the U.S. south with
all these huge, capital-hungry profits. The banks are set up to profit
from it."

Regardless of the drivers, the report says the increase represents a
worrying trend, especially after banks had started making stronger
commitments to slow financing for fossil fuels. In 2021, with backing
from the United Nations, the **[[Net Zero Bank Alliance]{.mark} launched
with the [aim of aligning banks']{.mark} lending and underwriting to the
goal enshrined [in]{.mark} the [Paris Agreement]{.mark}]{.underline}**
of keeping global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees compared to
pre-industrial levels. 

At the annual United Nations climate conference held in Glasgow that
year, many of the world's major banks joined the alliance, suggesting
banks were serious about their climate goals by adhering to an ambitious
global commitment.

**[[But]{.mark} earlier this year [all major]{.mark} American, Canadian
and Japanese [members]{.mark} of the alliance [pulled out]{.mark},
according to the new report. [Less than half of the]{.mark} 65
[banks]{.mark} analyzed in the report [were still
members]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[Even before the banks left the alliance, it had already [watered down
its goals]{.mark} from urging banks to align their financing with a 1.5
degree target [to]{.mark} a [less ambitious 2 degree]{.mark} target. The
reports' authors stress that voluntary [commitments are failing]{.mark},
and say the only viable way to slow fossil fuel financing is through
central bank and regulatory policies.]{.underline}**

**["[As long as there's no policy pressure]{.mark} to derail them from
their models, they won't do it," said Katrin Ganswindt, a researcher
with the German research firm Urgewald, a member of the coalition.
"[They won't change course]{.mark}."]{.underline}**

**Strong fossil fuel industry is key to energy security** (& status quo

(\"The Role of Oil and Gas in Global Energy Security,\" February 4,
https://energiesmedia.com/the-role-of-oil-and-gas-in-global-energy-security/
//wenxi)

The **[industrial revolution, which propelled societies into modernity,
was fueled by the abundant and versatile energy derived from [oil and
gas]{.mark}. From powering factories to facilitating transportation,
these [resources]{.mark} became [the backbone of economic
progress]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Nations with substantial oil and gas
reserves gained strategic advantages, establishing themselves as key
players on the global stage.

**[Ensuring Energy Stability]{.underline}**

**[[One of the most significant contributions]{.mark} of the oil and gas
industry [to global energy security is]{.mark} the provision of [stable
and consistent energy sources]{.mark}. [Unlike renewable energy]{.mark},
which is often subject to weather conditions and geographical
limitations, oil and gas can be extracted and utilized consistently,
providing a reliable energy foundation. This [stability is crucial
for]{.mark} meeting [the ever-growing energy demands]{.mark} of a
burgeoning global population.]{.underline}**

**[Geopolitical Dynamics And Energy Security]{.underline}**

**[The distribution of [oil and gas]{.mark} reserves across the globe
[has profound implications for geopolitical dynamics]{.mark}. Nations
endowed with abundant resources often become key players in
international relations, shaping alliances and influencing global
policies.]{.underline}** At the same time, dependency on oil and gas
imports can create vulnerabilities, highlighting the delicate balance
between energy security and geopolitical stability.

Technological Advancements

**[[The]{.mark} oil and gas [industry]{.mark} has continually evolved,
[embracing tech]{.mark}nological advancements [that]{.mark} enhance
efficiency, [reduce environmental impact]{.mark}, and unlock new
reserves. [Innovations]{.mark} in exploration, extraction, and refining
processes have not only increased the availability of these resources
but have also [made them more sustainable. This]{.mark} commitment to
technological progress [aligns with the broader goal of ensuring
long-term global energy security.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[[Energy,]{.mark} as a productive resource, is essential to ensuring
the productive lives of the country's citizens, it is also a strategic
and politically attributed resource and [plays an important role
in]{.mark} ensuring national [security and]{.mark} socio-economic
[stability]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Yang et al., 2022). As the world's
industrialization process accelerates, technological advances and
industrial expansion continue to drive social development, the extensive
demand for energy resources has triggered global concerns about energy
security. The concept of energy security is initially concerned with
ensuring an uninterrupted and reliable supply of energy to meet a
country's or region's production needs. However, despite the importance
of this issue, there is still no consensus among academics on a
definition of energy security. This is because the concept depends on
the contextual background and the different national settings (Kruyt et
al., 2009). The scope of energy security is not limited to energy supply
but also encompasses the stability of energy markets, the connectivity
of global energy supply chains, and the sustainability of energy
resources. **[Energy security is of paramount importance to the economic
stability and growth of countries and regions. [A stable energy
supply]{.mark} is the foundation for [sustain]{.mark}ing industrial
[production, transportation, and]{.mark} daily [life. Any
disruption]{.mark} in energy supply or sharp price fluctuations [will
result in higher]{.mark} production [costs and]{.mark} increased
[inflation]{.mark}, thereby [affecting economic growth and social
stability]{.mark}. In addition, energy security is an important
component of national security. Disruptions or [shortfalls in energy
supplies]{.mark} can lead to social unrest and [affect national
security]{.mark} (Sivaram and Saha, 2018). Therefore, [energy]{.mark}
[security is the key]{.mark} [to]{.mark} sustaining economic growth[,
ensuring political stability]{.mark}, and promoting social
well-being]{.underline}** (Lee et al., 2022). The factors affecting
energy security are multifaceted, among which the impact of geopolitical
risks on energy security cannot be ignored. Geopolitics is defined as
the risks associated with war, terrorism, and inter-State tensions that
affects the normalization of international relations and the peace
process (Lee and Wang, 2021). First of all, the political stability of
energy-supplying countries has a direct impact on the reliability of
their energy exports. Factors such as political instability, civil
unrest, and war can lead to disruptions in energy production and
transportation, thus threatening the stability of the global energy
supply chain. **[For instance, instances of political unrest and
conflict in the [Mid]{.mark}dle [East]{.mark} frequently resulted in
[disruptions to the oil supply]{.mark}, which in turn [gave rise
to]{.mark} pronounced [fluctuations in the price of oil on the
international market]{.mark} (Ben Cheikh and Ben Zaied, 2023). The
ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has also resulted in
significant fluctuations in the prices of oil and gas (Zhao et al.,
2023]{.underline}**). Secondly, the establishment and maintenance of
diplomatic relations between countries also have a significant impact on
energy security. International sanctions, trade disputes, and diplomatic
conflicts may restrict energy imports or exports, thereby exposing
countries that are dependent on imported energy to the risk of supply
shortages and price increases (Zhang et al., **[2024). [The relationship
between]{.mark} [Russia and the West served as an]{.mark} illustrative
[example]{.mark} of the manner in which geopolitical tensions can give
rise to [increased uncertainty]{.mark} regarding the supply of gas,
which in turn [affected Europe's energy security]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Slakaityte et al., 2023). In addition, geopolitical risks include the
security of energy transportation corridors, such as security threats to
maritime transportation routes (Desogus et al., 2023). A significant
disruption to the global energy market would result from the threat or
actual blocking of important transportation corridors, such as the
Strait of Hormuz or the Strait of Malacca (Meza et al.,
2022[).]{.underline}

### UQ --- Fossil Fuel Industry Strong --- 2NC/1NR

#### Oil demand and output are high

**Astakhova & Soldatkin 7/14** (Olesya Astakhova graduated at Plekhanov

https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/opec-projects-very-strong-third-quarter-oil-demand-followed-by-tight-balance-ria-2025-07-14//Bend

**[[OPEC]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which along with its allies is
**[[ramping up oil output, expects \"very strong\" oil
demand]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the third quarter and a
**[[tight]{.mark} supply-demand [balance in]{.mark} the [following
months]{.mark}]{.underline}**, its secretary general said, according to
a Russian media report.

The eight members of **[the [OPEC+ producer
group]{.mark}]{.underline}**, comprising the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia,
are **[[unwinding years of cuts]{.mark} that had been [aimed at
supporting the market]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Five sources told Reuters that **[[OPEC]{.mark}+ oil
producers]{.underline}** are set to **[[approve another big output
boost]{.underline}]{.mark}** for September.

Russia\'s RIA news agency quoted Haitham Al Ghais on Monday as telling
journalists on the sidelines of last week\'s **[OPEC]{.underline}**
seminar in Vienna that the organisation **[[expected demand growth of
1.3 million barrels per day]{.mark} year on year in 2025 [due to]{.mark}
a [strong global economy]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

\"And that means **[we are seeing]{.underline}**, especially in the
third quarter, **[very strong demand growth]{.underline}**,\" he said,
according to the report.

\"In the fourth quarter also we\'re seeing good demand growth, and the
**[balances will be tight.]{.underline}** And this is one of the main
fundamental factors that is leading for the group of **[[eight
countries]{.mark} to [bring barrels back to]{.mark} the
[market]{.mark}]{.underline}**,\" he added.

Al Ghais\' comments come as OPEC trimmed its global oil demand forecasts
for the next four years last week on slowing Chinese growth, even as it
lifted its longer-term view based on rising consumption in the
developing world.

Global demand will average **[[105 million barrels per day this
year]{.underline}]{.mark}**, OPEC said in its 2025 World Oil
Outlook published on Thursday. It **[[expects]{.mark} demand [to
grow]{.mark}]{.underline}** to average 106.3 million bpd in 2026 and

Utilities across the **[[E]{.mark}uropean [U]{.mark}nion [cranked output

plants]{.mark}]{.underline}** during the opening half of 2025,
**[boosting power sector emissions and [reversing]{.mark} recent [energy
transition momentum]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

The upswing in fossil production follows two years of steep declines in
fossil use within the EU, which established Europe as a global leader in
efforts to curb reliance on polluting fuels in power production.

However, **[[year-on-year drops in]{.mark} output from [wind farms and
hydro dams deprived EU]{.mark} utilities]{.underline}** of key sources
of clean power during January to June, **[[and forced them to compensate
with]{.mark} sharply [higher]{.mark} generation from [fossil fuel
plants]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

\<Graph omitted\>

This **[abrupt [reversal in EU fossil fuel use highlights the
challenge]{.mark}]{.underline}** facing even modern energy systems when
weather patterns impede clean power supplies, and suggests that
**[[fossil fuels]{.mark} may [stay rooted in global power systems for
years more]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

CLIMATE CHANGED

**[[EU utilities generated 13% more]{.mark} electricity [from fossil
fuels]{.mark}]{.underline}** during January to June compared to the same
period in 2024, **[[which was the largest annual increase]{.mark} in
fossil output]{.underline}** for that period since 2017, data from think
tank Ember showed.

**[[Gas]{.mark}-fired generation [climbed by 19%]{.mark} to the [highest
in three years]{.mark}, while [coal]{.mark}-fired output [rose by 2% to
two-year highs]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

The higher gas and coal combustion resulted in **[[power emissions
rising by 9%]{.underline}]{.mark}** from the year before to 297 million
metric tons of carbon dioxide, and means that the **[EU could discharge
nearly 600 million tons of CO2 this year]{.underline}** if the current
burn pace is sustained.

The main triggers of the higher fossil fuel use were steep declines in
clean power supplies tied to weather conditions across Europe since late
2024.

\<Graph emitted\>

**[[Output from wind farms]{.mark},]{.underline}** which accounted for
close to 20% of EU electricity supplies during the first half of 2024,
**[[registered]{.mark} the [largest year-over-year
fall]{.mark}]{.underline}** on record during January to June,
**[[dropping by 9%]{.underline}]{.mark}** to 225 terawatt hours (TWh).

Sustained low wind speeds at turbine level - especially in Germany which
is home to over 30% of EU wind farm capacity - were the main drag on
wind power production.

At the same time, below-expected snow and rainfall over the winter in
Europe resulted in a 15% year-on-year drop in electricity output from
hydro dams, which accounted for around 15% of EU electricity supplies
last year.

The roughly 164 TWh of hydro electricity output during January to June
was 28 TWh less than during the same months in 2024, and was the lowest
in two years for that period.

**[[SOLAR SHINES - BUT NOT ENOUGH]{.underline}]{.mark}**

A 21% or 32 TWh increase in EU solar power electricity supplies helped
provide some cushioning for utilities against the drops in wind and
hydro generation.

The 179 TWh of electricity output from EU solar farms during the first
half of 2025 was a record, and marked the first time that the EU\'s
solar farms produced more electricity than the region\'s hydro dams
during the January to June window.

\<Graph omitted\>

And steady increases in installed solar capacity look set to lift
solar-powered electricity supplies to new heights over the coming
months, ensuring that clean energy advocates in the EU will have
something to celebrate.

However, the deep and enduring drops to wind and hydro output are also a
major cause for concern, especially as climate trends indicate that
further deviations in weather patterns from previous averages can be
expected.

\<Graph omitted\>

Steadily rising average temperatures are resulting in steadily declining
snow coverage at low altitudes across Europe, and are pinching regional
hydro dam output - despite hydro dam capacity in the EU hitting a record
last year.

And while climate change is triggering more intense storms in many
areas, it is also causing more frequent wind droughts as the temperature
differential between the Earth\'s poles and tropical areas narrows.

This phenomenon - known as Global Stilling - is a major worry for energy
planners who have been banking on large scale wind farms playing a
dependable role in clean electricity generation over the coming decades.

If wind speeds regularly slow to a crawl for months on end, and hydro
networks continue to get only meagre snow and rainfall during the
winters**[, [EU energy suppliers]{.mark} will [struggle]{.mark} to keep
up [with demand]{.mark} - [even if solar output]{.mark} keeps
[climb]{.mark}ing.]{.underline}**

**[That in turn [means]{.mark} that [regardless of long-term ambitions
to wean power systems off fossil fuels, natural gas and coal
will]{.mark} likely [remain integral]{.mark} tools [for EU]{.mark}
utilities [for the foreseeable future]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

March 2022, Energy Fact Sheet: Why does Russian oil and gas matter?
https://www.iea.org/articles/energy-fact-sheet-why-does-russian-oil-and-gas-matter

A giant in natural gas markets

**[[Russia]{.mark} is the world's second-largest producer of natural
gas, behind the United States, and [has the world's largest gas
reserves]{.mark}. Russia [is the]{.mark} world's [largest gas
exporter]{.mark}. In 2021 the country produced 762 bcm of natural gas,
and exported approximately 210 bcm via pipeline.]{.underline}**

Gazprom and Novatek are Russia's main gas producers, but many Russian
oil companies, including Rosneft, also operate gas production
facilities. Gazprom, which is state-owned, is the largest gas producer,
but its share of production has declined over the past decade, as
Novatek and Rosneft have expanded their production capacity. However,
[Gazprom still accounted for 68% of Russian gas production in
2021.]{.underline} Historically, production was concentrated in West
Siberia, **[but [investment has shifted in the past decade to]{.mark}
Yamal and Eastern Siberia and the Far East, as well as [the offshore
Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Russia also has a wide-reaching gas export pipeline network, both via
transit routes through Belarus and Ukraine, and via pipelines sending
gas directly into Europe (including  Nord Stream,  Blue Stream, and
TurkStream pipelines) all. Russia completed work on the Nord Stream II
pipeline in 2021, but the German government decided not to approve
certification in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine**[. [Russia
natural gas accounted for 45% of imports and almost 40% of European
Union gas demand]{.mark} in 2021. This share has increased in recent
years]{.underline}**, as European domestic natural gas production has
declined. Germany, Turkey and Italy are the largest importers of Russian
natural gas.

In late 2019, Russia launched a major eastward gas export pipeline, the
roughly 3,000 km-long Power of Siberia pipeline, which has a capacity of
38 bcm, in order to be able to send gas from far east fields directly to
China. In 2021, Gazprom exported over 10 bcm of natural gas via the
Power of Siberia pipeline, with exports set to gradually ramp-up to 38
bcm in the coming years. Russia is looking to develop the Power of
Siberia-2 pipeline, with a capacity of 50 bcm/y, which would supply
China from the West Siberian gas fields. No supply agreements and no
final investment decision have yet been reached on the pipeline, which
would further lessen Russia's  reliance on European customers for gas.

Furthermore, **[[Russia has been expanding its]{.mark} liquefied natural
gas [(LNG) capacity]{.mark}, in order to compete with growing LNG
exports from the United States, Australia and Qatar. In 2021, the
government released a long-term LNG development plan, targeting 110-190
bcm/year LNG exports by 2025. In 2021, Russia exported 40 bcm of LNG,
[making it the world's 4th largest LNG exporter]{.mark} and [accounting
for approximately 8% of global LNG]{.mark} supply. ]{.underline}**

**[In recent years, [Russia has increasingly focused on the Arctic as a
way to increase oil and gas production]{.mark} and offset declines at
existing and older production sites. [The Arctic accounts for over 80%
of Russia's n]{.mark}atural [g]{.mark}as [production and]{.mark} an
estimated [20%  of its crude production]{.mark}.]{.underline}** While
climate change threatens future investment in the region, it also
presents Russia with the opportunity of increasing access to Arctic
trade routes, allowing for further flexibility for seaborne deliveries
of fossil fuels, particularly to Asia.

Nearly four years ago, while campaigning in the runup to the last
presidential election, Donald Trump warned that President Joe Biden
would "destroy" the oil industry.As Trump and Biden are set once again
to face off in a presidential election, Trump has renewed claims that
Biden's agenda has hurt energy producers, promising to hit rewind on
Biden's environmental policies.But [**[the oil and gas industry in the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates []{.mark}has
[thrived]{.mark}**]{.underline} under the current president, **[[even
as]{.mark} [the Biden administration has touted]{.mark} its
[efforts]{.mark} [to transitio]{.mark}n away from fossil fuels and
[towards green energy]{.mark}]{.underline}** sources.In the last three
and a half years[, US oil production --- and **[oil and gas company
profits]{.mark}** --- **[have broken records]{.mark}**.The top five
US-based oil and gas companies by market cap, according to S&P Global
--- ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), ConocoPhillips (CPP), EOG Resources
(EOG) and Schlumberger (SLB) --- have raked in more than \$250 billion
in profits between 2021 and 2023. That's a 160% jump]{.underline}
compared to the first three years of the pro-big-oil Trump
administration, according to calculations by CNN.[**The energy
industry's recent profit** windfall **underscores the limited influence
of any US president**]{.underline} --- whether in favor of fossil fuel
or not --- in the global oil and gas market.In Biden's case, many of the
dynamics that supercharged oil and gas industry profits during his
presidency were not directly related to his administration's policies:
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a post-pandemic surge in travel demand and
the proliferation of new technology that helped the US significantly
increase its production of oil and natural gas all played a role, said
Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information
Service."On balance, I think it's been a really, really good atmosphere
for most \[oil\] companies," said Kloza.According to the US Energy
Information Administration, [the US produced more crude oil than ever in
2023]{.underline}, beating the previous record set in 2019 --- and
Investors have been richly rewarded. [The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund
(XLE), which tracks [**the performance** **of**]{.mark} **the largest
[oil and gas companies, is up more than 100% since Biden's
inauguration]{.mark}**]{.underline}.The cash-rich industry has not shied
away from dealmaking. Last month, oil giant ConocoPhillips said it would
acquire rival Marathon Oil in a deal valued at \$22.5 billion. That
acquisition comes on the heels of ExxonMobil's \$60 billion purchase of
Pioneer Natural Resources and Hess shareholders' approval of a \$53
billion sale to Chevron.Over the last several years, [big oil companies
have used profits to purchase their own stock on the open market,
lifting share prices.]{.underline} Notably, Chevron announced plans for
a \$75 billion buyback last year and Exxon said it would ramp up its
annual pace of share repurchases to \$20 billion per year.Chevron's
major buyback package drew reproach from the Biden administration."For a
company that claimed not too long ago that it was 'working hard' to
increase oil production, handing out \$75 billion to executives and
wealthy shareholders sure is an odd way to show it," said White House
spokesperson Abdullah Hasan last year.Shareholders were also paid in the
form of dividends. In 2023, ExxonMobil was the third-largest dividend
payer in the S&P 500, behind only Microsoft and Apple, according to
ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods.

[Many oil CEOs have also grown their own fortunes during the Biden
administration. Chevron CEO Mike Wirth saw his compensation grow 17%,
from \$22.6 million in 2021 to \$26.5 million in 2023.]{.underline}
Exxon CEO Woods' compensation rose an eye-popping 56% in that span, from
\$23.6 million in 2021 to \$36.9 million in 2023.In his first term,
Trump overturned more than 100 environmental rules and actions put in
place by the Obama administration.In April, Trump allegedly promised oil
industry executives that he would reverse some of Biden's climate
policies in exchange for a \$1 billion contribution to this reelection
campaign, according to an exclusive report from The Washington
Post.While climate advocates say Biden's record regarding the climate
crisis and clean energy is mixed, **[[Biden delivered on the largest
climate investment in US history]{.underline}]{.mark}**---**[[by far the
biggest legislative win for the environmental movement since the Clean
Air Act]{.underline}]{.mark}.**[On his first day in the White House,
Biden revoked a permit that his predecessor, Trump, had granted to the
controversial Keystone XL pipeline and placed a temporary moratorium on
oil and gas leasing in the Arctic]{.underline}. "The era of supporting
fossil fuels, even as a temporary bridge to a clean future, is over,"
Bob McNally, president of consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group told CNN
at the time.Additionally, the Biden administration has taken steps to
try to nudge the auto industry away from using gas-powered cars, like
rolling out new tailpipe emissions standards and revamping electric
vehicle tax credits.Earlier this year, Biden announced a temporary pause
on approving several pending liquefied natural gas export projects,
saying "This pause on new LNG approvals sees the climate crisis for what
it is: the existential threat of our time."The energy industry has taken
note. This year, members of the oil and gas industry have largely
donated to Republican candidates and conservative groups, according to
Open Secrets.

[**[However]{.mark}**,]{.underline} in March,
**[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}** Biden [[administration]{.mark}
[approved]{.mark} [ConocoPhillips' massive Willow oil drilling
project]{.mark} on Alaska's North Slope, which holds around 600 million
barrels of oil]{.underline}, angering climate advocates.Despite his
mixed record with oil and gas companies, though, Biden has presided over
a historic run for the industry, [Kloza said. "[The oil **industry in
general**]{.mark}, and this is true from the wellhead to the refinery to
the gas pumps, **[is much, much more prosperous in the last 10 years

**[Over [\$130 million in grants]{.mark} allocated [to clean
energy]{.mark} projects [in]{.mark} rural [Alaska]{.mark} are now
[frozen]{.mark}, [following]{.mark} one of President Donald [Trump's
ex]{.mark}ecutive [o]{.mark}rders. The [projects]{.mark} -- which
[include]{.mark} hydroelectric [dams]{.mark}, wind [turbines and
solar]{.mark} energy systems]{.underline}** -- aim to lower energy costs
in rural communities and bring them additional revenue to support
crucial infrastructure.

Trump signed dozens of executive orders during his first day in office,
including one that freezes funding from the federal Inflation Reduction
Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. A section of that order mandated
that federal agencies pause the disbursement of funds appropriated
through those acts.

[**That's [created uncertainty for]{.mark} many Alaska [projects]{.mark}
--- including two large wind turbines** slated to be built in
Kotzebue]{.underline}. Those turbines, along with the community's
existing renewable energy assets, would allow the community to produce
more than half of their energy from solar and wind, said Chad Nordlum,
the energy project manager for the Native Village of Kotzebue. He said
it's unclear now if the funding freeze will affect the project's
timeline.

**"[The freeze that Trump has put on the Inflation Reduction Act has
[definitely caused a lot of concern]{.mark} for Kotzebue for the wind
project]{.underline}," Nordlum said. "[It puts a [lot of questions out
there]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Right now, there doesn\'t seem to be much
we can do on our end. We\'re just waiting for clarity."

How freeze affects projects in progress

The Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium has partnered with tribes
across the state, including in Kotzebue, to receive the federal grants.
In total, they've been awarded contracts for about \$132 million, said
Katya Karankevich, a project manager at ANTHC's Department of
Environmental Health and Engineering.

The contracts covered hydroelectric dams in Old Harbor and Chignik Bay;
wind turbines in Kotzebue, Toksook Bay and Chevak; and solar energy
systems in Ouzinkie, Brevig Mission, Elim, Koyuk, Savoonga and Teller.
ANTHC also received about \$32 million for their own grant program for
solar, which would cover between nine and 12 additional communities.

And ANTHC has already started spending or obligating funds with
contractors on 30% of the projects, Karankevich said. **[[With]{.mark}
the federal [funding freeze]{.mark}, the consortium now [cannot request
reimbursement for the work already started]{.mark}]{.underline}**, she
said.

"We will have another \$19 million obligated for local contractors to
perform work in the next 90 days on these projects," she said. "While
this hold is an inconvenience to us**, [it's a [big]{.mark}ger [burden
for local businesses who want to get paid]{.mark} for work already
completed under these contracts]{.underline}."**

**Geoengineering and other renewable technology failing now --
Indigenous resistance and Trump**

Environmental and Indigenous activists declared Thursday that
[\"**[geoengineering fails again]{.mark},\" welcoming the shutdown of a
project that aimed to use \"a reflective material to protect and restore
Arctic sea ice,\" which is rapidly disappearing as humanity\'s reliance
on fossil fuels heats the planet.**]{.underline}

**[Noting that \"we committed to moving forward only if we could
conclusively demonstrate both the safety and effectiveness of our
approach,\" the [A]{.mark}rctic [I]{.mark}ce [P]{.mark}roject team
confirmed in an online statement that it \"will be [concluding its
research]{.mark} and winding down the organization.\"]{.underline}**

**[\"While our climate impact simulations have shown promising results
(with a new scientific paper forthcoming), recent ecotoxicological tests
have revealed potential risks to the Arctic food chain,\" the team said.
\"Our initial approach was to continue research aimed at addressing
these concerns. Upon further reflection, however, the board decided that
the [combination of]{.mark} these new test results with [broad
skepticism]{.mark} toward geoengineering, [resistance to introducing new
materials]{.mark} into the Arctic Ocean, and the [increasingly
challenging funding environment (and paucity of federal research
dollars]{.mark}), the [most realistic path was to conclude]{.mark} our
[research]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}**

\"Nature is not a laboratory; it is a living entity we are in
relationship with.\"

Responding in a Thursday statement, Hands Off Mother Earth Alliance
global coordinator Coraina de la Plaza said that \"the cancellation of
the Arctic Ice Project marks another monumental victory for our planet
and future generations, a victory where Indigenous peoples\' resistance
has been central. This outcome reflects the power of community advocacy,
and while **[the [fight]{.mark} against geoengineering is [far from
over]{.mark}, this is a significant step to continue protecting the
Arctic against industry greed and vested interests.\"]{.underline}**

Panganga Pungowiyi, climate geoengineering organizer at Indigenous
Environmental Network, called the decision \"long overdue.\"

\"We are concerned for the community members in Utqiaġvik who were made
to spread football fields of this material onto their frozen lake. For
years, we stood in defense of Indigenous lands and the sacred ice that
has sustained our communities for generations,\" Pungowiyi explained.
\"Our concerns about the reckless use of harmful materials were
dismissed, yet we knew that the health of our ecosystems and the wisdom
of our people must not be overlooked. We continually showed up in
defense of free prior and informed consent, and made our presence
known.\"

\"We continue to state firmly that nature is not a laboratory; it is a
living entity we are in relationship with,\" the organizer added.
\"While we find relief in this victory, [we remain vigilant against
other forms of geoengineering that threaten our sacred
spaces]{.underline}. Together, we will continue to educate and empower
our communities, standing with our lands, waters, and air for the
generations to come.\"

Silvia Ribeiro, Latin America director at ETC Group, said that \"today
we celebrate the wisdom, experience, and work of Indigenous peoples and
organizations in Alaska that stopped this project and **[[stand in
solidarity]{.mark} with their vigilance [against similar
experiments]{.mark} that are planned in Arctic regions.\"]{.underline}**

Mary Church, geoengineering campaign manager at the Center for
International Environmental Law, also framed the development as \"a huge
victory for the Indigenous communities at the forefront of resistance to
the industries and vested interests that are polluting the planet and
gambling with our collective future.\"

\"Geoengineering approaches do nothing to address the root causes of the
climate crisis and instead delay real solutions, offering a free pass to
polluters,\" she stressed. \"Following the recent reaffirmation of the
global moratorium on geoengineering at the U.N. biodiversity summit in
Colombia, governments need to act to prevent harmful outdoor experiments
and the slippery slope to legitimizing deployment. Instead of betting on
highly speculative techno-fixes, governments must prioritize an urgent
and just transition away from fossil fuels to protect vital Arctic
ecosystems.\"

Benjamin Day, a senior campaigner for climate and energy justice at
Friends of the Earth U.S., also looked to the fight ahead.

\"The [decision to shut down the Arctic Ice Project completes the
Geoengineering Hype Cycle that we now see so often: Entrepreneurs swoop
into local communities claiming they have a solution to global warming,
assuring everyone it\'s completely safe and ignoring the red flags
raised by those with deep knowledge of local ecosystems]{.underline},\"
Day said. \"After countless wasted dollars and press attention, it\'s
revealed the community was right and geoengineering is not a safe or
responsible way to address climate change.\"

\"Collectively,\" he argued, \"we must stop enabling this cycle and work
towards rapidly and equitably transitioning our communities to
sustainable energy and land-use practices.\"

The winding down of the Arctic Ice Project comes amid **[[global fears

President Donald [Trump]{.mark}---who [cozied up to Big Oil]{.mark}

This 23-million acre area was set aside by former President Warren G.

controversial.

### AT: Arctic Green Transition Now --- 2NC/1NR

**[Speculative bubbles]{.underline} and lack of [domestic
mining]{.underline} prevent wide scale transition -- Sweden proves**

**Hedlund '25** \[Stefan; April 28; SME, widely published author,
researcher, and lecturer; GIS; "Sweden fumbles its green transition,"

jason

Inspired by its very own teenage climate change activist Greta Thunberg,
in the past decade **[[Sweden]{.mark} decided to [place]{.mark} a [major
wager on]{.mark} promoting the [green transition]{.mark}. In contrast to
fluffy proclamations about lifestyle changes, Stockholm's strategy was
to be based on the solid application of state-of-the-art technology. The
early stages included the [creation of]{.mark} three new industrial
groupings: [Hybrit]{.mark} (a company built to produce fossil-free
steel), [Northvolt]{.mark} (a company founded to produce batteries for
electric vehicles, or EVs) [and Stegra]{.mark} (a second venture to
produce fossil-free steel). Given the huge amounts of electricity that
would be needed to realize those ventures, the plan for reliable power
supplies went [all-in on]{.mark} a massive expansion of [wind
farms]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Above all, Sweden's green transition was designed to be a model for the
world to emulate, providing a picture-perfect illustration of what a
well-designed public-private partnership can achieve.

During the early years, the media was captivated by an abundance of
optimistic politicians and entrepreneurs, touting their close
cooperation. In June 2022, then Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson, a
Social Democrat now in the opposition, smilingly informed members of
parliament about "the wave of investment that is currently sweeping
across Sweden, with battery factories in the north and the west, with
fossil-free steel production and with green mining. It is fantastic!"
She concluded by lauding the Green Party for driving the country in the
direction of sustainability. Sweden was now leading the way into a green
future. Or so it seemed.

Entering into green transition dreamland

It kicked off in 2016, with the creation of Hybrit Development AB, a
joint venture formed by state-owned behemoths SSAB (steelmaking), LKAB
(mining) and Vattenfall (power generation). Aiming to fundamentally
transform the iron and steel industry, a unique technology was developed
that would allow the production of fossil-free steel. By using hydrogen
instead of coal in the ore reduction process, emissions would be clean
water instead of dirty carbon. The company envisioned itself being able
to reduce Sweden's total carbon dioxide emissions by at least 10
percent. Realizing that the use of fossil-free steel would greatly
improve their own customer relations, makers of cars, trucks and other
heavy equipment happily jumped on the bandwagon.

A second step was taken in 2020, with the formation of H2 Green Steel,
later to be renamed Stegra. The business proposal was the same as that
of Hybrit, namely, to produce fossil-free steel by using hydrogen
instead of coal. Production was to begin in 2024, with an initial
capacity of 2.5 million tons per year. The plan envisioned that by 2030,
production would rise to double the 2024 volume. Based in the city of
Boden, an old military bastion just 80 kilometers south of the Arctic
Circle, the venture was to create 1,500 jobs.

Another critical step was taken in 2021, when the company Northvolt AB
commissioned its first manufacturing plant in Skelleftea, a bygone
industrial and mining town located on the Swedish coast of the Gulf of
Bothnia. Founded in 2015 by two former Tesla executives, the company
would use lithium-ion technology to produce batteries for electric
vehicles. The vision was that its booming output of batteries would
greatly reduce European dependence on China. In support of this vision,
the company also announced plans for five other plants to be built in
Europe and North America.

As all three ventures were revving up their respective publicity
campaigns, the previously stagnant north of Sweden was transformed into
a veritable Klondike for green investment. Recruitment campaigns were
launched to attract workers, both from Sweden and from abroad. The city
of Skelleftea in particular became a boomtown, where housing could not
be built soon enough to accommodate all the incoming workers.

Calls for prudence drowned out

There had been numerous warning voices in recent years, raising
questions both about the relevance of the proposed technologies (which
had not yet been proven as viable at an industrial scale) and about the
generation sources for the exponential boost in consumption of
electricity that was to come. Those voices were drowned out.

Facts & figures

Sweden's state-of-the-art green transition

The media preferred to go with the hype around the proposed
transformation of the thinly populated north of Sweden into the promised
land for green technologies and sustainability. Those who had raised
concerns were, however, soon to be proven right. **[[In]{.mark} October
[2024, Hybrit was "placed on pause]{.mark}."]{.underline}**

**[Sweden wakes up from its green revolution dream]{.underline}**

**[On [March]{.mark} 12, [2025]{.mark}, it all came to a screeching
halt. Following a long period of attempted rescues that included seeking
Chapter 11 protection in a United States court, [Northvolt]{.mark}
finally [declared bankruptcy]{.mark}. It was the biggest bankruptcy in
Swedish corporate history, involving numerous outside investors and
creditors, most notably major auto manufacturers like Volkswagen that
had banked nearly \$1 billion on Swedish deliveries of batteries for
their own made-in-Europe EVs. Many believe that [Stegra is likely
next]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

The scandal not only provided a sordid illustration of how the
public-private partnership had allowed venture capitalists to get poorly
monitored access to taxpayer money via lavish loan guarantees. Even
worse was that Swedish laws had been changed to enable state pension
funds to invest in new ventures that are not listed on the stock
exchange, a high-risk bet with funds requiring conservative management.

Meanwhile, it has also come to light that the [various windfarm projects
associated with the overall green-transition strategy have been huge
loss-makers.]{.underline}

Implications of the green transition going bust

The losses that have been inflicted on the pension funds alone
constitute a huge scandal. Foreign [auto makers like Volkswagen and BMW
have wound down investment activities, casting doubt on the chosen
technology]{.underline} and commercial strategy. Foreign investors and
sources of green lending have had an equally negative experience. The
city of Skelleftea is in a major crisis, and nobody seems to know what
to do with all the foreign workers who were attracted to settle in the
barren north of Sweden, where their newly bought houses can now only be
sold at huge losses.

Attention is turning to what will be done to clean up the mess. Instead
of showing the world a glorious path into a fossil-free future,
**[Sweden now stands as a [cautioning example]{.mark}, [warning]{.mark}
others of [how]{.mark} unchecked [green activism can produce huge
speculative bubbles that cause widespread damage when they
burst]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

The country now finds itself at a crossroads and will have to decide on
three highly contentious issues, all of which have implications for the
broader European outlook.

Energy generation

The first issue concerns cleaner power generation, which is critical to
all visions of the green transition. When Sweden's nuclear power program
reached its peak in the 1980s and 1990s, with 12 operating reactors, the
country had a completely fossil-free power generation system. Half was
nuclear and half was hydro. A small oil-fired plant was kept in reserve,
as a hedge against sudden spikes in demand. Most importantly, the system
was balanced, with hydro catering to demand in the north and nuclear to
demand in the south.

Driven by a red-green coalition (three center-left to left-wing
political parties), the country proceeded to shut down six of its
nuclear reactors and to **[place a massive wager on expansion of wind
power that has already markedly destabilized the electricity
distribution system. When it is windy, the country exports electricity.
When it is calm, electricity prices go through the roof.]{.underline}**

**[More importantly, when demand in the denuclearized and heavily
populated south is high, transmission capacity from the distant north is
woefully insufficient. This not only leads to huge differences in prices
that are set according to geographic criteria. It also creates technical
problems, as the system is not built to handle large fluctuations
combined with the implied needs for long-distance
transmission.]{.underline}**

The wager on a green transition in the north shone an unforgiving light
on these problems. Given the implied longer-term increase in electricity
demand, and the inability to expand hydropower, the only way out --
short of acknowledging the utility of nuclear power or returning to
fossil fuels − was a formidable wager on wind power, mainly in the form
of huge offshore windfarms that would require additional government
support. The outlook for the latter to materialize is currently shrouded
in great uncertainty.

As the current center-right government has campaigned on a return to
nuclear power, it has taken a decidedly cold attitude to further
taxpayer subsidies for the expansion of wind power. The government has
raised the bar for entry into such ventures by announcing that the state
will not foot the bill for connector cables from offshore wind farms to
the land-based grid. And it has announced a blanket ban of any offshore
windfarms in the central part of the Baltic Sea, citing
military-security concerns that such installations might make it hard to
detect incoming Russian cruise missiles.

[Given that the envisioned return to nuclear power will not materialize
in the short term, Sweden's **[green transition is in
jeopardy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. If it falters for reasons of inadequate
technology, then the problems relating to spikes in demand for
electricity will be alleviated. But if political priorities result in
more public support so the green transition continues, it begs the
question of how to boost power generation effectively and sustainably.

Mining: Not in my backyard!

The **[second strategic issue Stockholm faces concerns mining. Although
Sweden has long been an operator of nuclear power plants and it has
substantial deposits of uranium, the fuel for reactors,
[environmentalists]{.mark} have [refused to allow mining of]{.mark}
those domestic deposits. Instead, they prefer that uranium be imported
from Russia.]{.underline}**

**[The refusal to allow mining concessions becomes even more contentious
with respect to the [r]{.mark}are [e]{.mark}arth [m]{.mark}ineral[s that
are]{.mark} so badly [needed for the green transition]{.mark}. While
Sweden does have substantial deposits of such minerals, green lobbies
have successfully barred their exploration. This [NIMBY]{.mark} ("not in
my backyard") mentality [ensures]{.mark} that [mining]{.mark} for rare
earths, like uranium mining, [takes place far afield]{.mark}, in this
case in China or in poor countries in Africa. The political left's
intransigence prolongs Sweden being beholden to adversarial powers while
stymieing the country's economic development and
security.]{.underline}**

**[Stranded production assets]{.underline}**

**[The third issue concerns what to do with production facilities that
have been built at huge public expense and are currently idle.
Fossil-free steel sounds like a great idea -- but is the technology
sufficiently viable?]{.underline}**

**[The Northvolt factory is still standing and there is hope that
outside investors may still be found. But if [Beijing]{.mark} turns out
to be the [only willing party]{.mark}, then the [hope of producing
sufficient batteries for Europe to reduce its dependence on China will
be defeated]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Stockholm is also likely to cite
security as a rationale to prevent a Chinese takeover of stranded
assets.

**Canada cut NWP renewable efforts, resulting in [entire
programs]{.underline} getting [deleted]{.underline}**

The **[[Arctic Energy Alliance]{.mark}, which is funded through the
territorial and federal governments, [offers energy efficiency
programs]{.mark} to northerners and supports small-scale renewable
energy projects.]{.underline}**

**[For example, the group -- also known as the AEA -- has administered
programs helping people to buy wood stoves, evaluate their homes for
energy efficiency improvements like better insulation, install solar, or
acquire rebates on electric vehicles.]{.underline}**

**[But a large chunk of the [AEA's funding recently evaporated]{.mark},
making it [harder to meet demand]{.mark} or keep the same programs in
place.]{.underline}**

In 2019-20, the Arctic Energy Alliance signed on to a federal program
called the Low Carbon Economy Fund that effectively doubled the funding
at the AEA's disposal.

That cash was used to make existing programs better and create some new
ones to fill gaps.

The Low Carbon Economy **[Fund money has now run out and there is [no
indication it will be renewed or replaced]{.mark} by a similar federal
program. That means the AEA is back to "essentially our funding levels
from 2018-19," its boss, Mark Heyck, told MLAs in December last
year.]{.underline}**

**[Heyck said the [absence of]{.mark} that [funding]{.mark} had
[resulted in the closure of]{.mark} popular [programs]{.mark} like those
that helped people in smaller communities to acquire wood
stoves.]{.underline}**

**[Even as the NWT completes its initial corridor of electric charging
stations from Yellowknife to the south, the territory is [not budgeting
any money for e]{.mark}lectric [v]{.mark}ehicle rebates this coming year
-- deleting the \$153,000 it set aside last year.]{.underline}**

In the legislature on Monday, infrastructure minister Caroline Wawzonek
said the GNWT had raised the disappearing federal funding with Ottawa
counterparts.

"I suspect -- given the state of affairs in shift, or likely to be in
shift shortly, with our federal colleagues -- that this is an area we
will have to re-examine once we know what the next government's
iteration of priorities might be in Ottawa," Wawzonek said in response
to a question from Frame Lake MLA Julian Morse, referring to the
likelihood of a forthcoming federal election.

"We put a lot of money into big infrastructure projects in this
department, and I'm not denying that those are important, but a little
bit of money to each individual homeowner goes a long way to helping
them reduce the cost to their pocketbooks, and that's the thing that
people feel when you make changes for them," said Morse.

"People aren't going to notice their costs go down because we put a
bunch of money towards this or that infrastructure project. ... It's
something that I think is an important area. I think it's important to
residents."

Earlier that day, Yellowknife North MLA Shauna Morgan had questioned
Wawzonek on what she said was a view that energy initiatives are "a
luxury we can't afford."

"Wasting energy is a luxury we can't afford," Morgan said.

"In each year's budget we devote more and more millions to energy
subsidies, electricity rate subsidies, seniors' home heating subsidies,
fuel subsidies for communities in crisis such as Norman Wells.

"These offer much-needed relief but they don't address any of the root
causes of high energy costs, leaving the government on the hook for
ever-increasing subsidies. We could reduce the amount of subsidies
needed by ramping up our energy efficiency rebates and incentives."

Morgan gave the examples of a Yellowknife family saving \$6,000 per year
by insulating a 1970s-era trailer, or a family in Fort Liard saving
\$600 annually on water and electricity bills through help to buy more
efficient appliances.

"With sunsets in federal funding we have significantly reduced our
rebate programs, leaving more and more folks choosing inefficient
furnaces, boilers, and appliances because they seem cheaper upfront,"
she said.

"But it's costing them much more in the long run. It's also costing the
climate and costing this government. We are sliding backwards."

Wawzonek did not disagree, saying the loss of federal funding through
the Low Carbon Economy Fund had resulted in a "significant impact."

However, she said the department did not have an obvious means of
replacing that cash and restoring the Arctic Energy Alliance's former
level of service.

**["We [don't have]{.mark} other or additional [independent
funds]{.mark} necessarily to come up with in areas where we could
realign," the minister said.]{.underline}**

**["Without being able to source some additional funding, it's
[difficult to come up]{.mark} at this point in time [with a]{.mark}
simple answer or simple [solution]{.mark}."]{.underline}**

**[Below, read a transcript of Morgan's Monday exchanges with the
minister.]{.underline}**

**[These exchanges took place in the House on March 3,
2025.]{.underline}**

**[Shauna Morgan: The Arctic Energy Alliance has experienced major
funding reductions in recent years and struggle to meet the huge demand
from NWT residents, businesses, and community governments for its
programs and services. And as of October of 2024, they had actually run
out of money for their energy rebate programs and were no longer
accepting applications.]{.underline}**

fossil fuel industry**

All this occurs in a context where the [**[renewable energy]{.mark},
such as wind, solar and hydro, are increasingly [gaining]{.mark} [ground
against fossil fuels]{.mark}. [Countries such as Norway]{.mark}, which
[have traditionally been large oil producers, are]{.mark} [beginning to
diversify]{.mark}**]{.underline} their economies to reduce their
dependence on hydrocarbons.

Norway, for example, has set up a commission to study its energy model,
which concludes that it will not extract all of its hydrocarbon reserves
and that it needs to diversify its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to
generate other types of wealth, mainly from renewable sources. This
phenomenon is being replicated in other oil-producing countries, as
increasing efficiency and competition in the renewable energy sector is
making crude oil extraction in complex areas such as the Arctic
increasingly less profitable.

La International Energy Agency (IEA) has warned that investment in
renewable energy must be tripled if carbon reduction targets are to be
met and global temperature rise kept below 1,5°C. This paradigm shift is
directly affecting the fossil fuel industry in the Arctic.

**[[Could the Arctic be the turning point]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
energy geopolitics?

**[[With]{.mark} increasing pressure to reduce carbon emissions and
[the]{.mark} unstoppable [rise of renewable energy]{.mark}, [the Arctic
has]{.mark} [gone from being]{.mark} a [hydrocarbon-rich]{.mark} region
[to a battlefield]{.mark} in the fight against climate change. [The
transition to a]{.mark} [green]{.mark}er [economy]{.mark} [is]{.mark}
not only [affecting]{.mark} large [fossil fuel
corporations]{.mark}]{.underline}**, but also the geopolitical powers
that depend on these resources.

Russia, for example, with its vast Arctic territory, has increased its
investment in infrastructure in the region, building gas pipelines and
offshore platforms in an attempt to capitalise on its natural resources.
However, international sanctions, as a result of the conflict in
Ukraine, are affecting its ability to attract foreign investment that is
key to the development of these projects.

On international agreements such as the High Seas Treaty and the
geographical restrictions imposed by some banks such as the Santander,
also play an important role in the governance of the region. These
treaties seek to limit the exploitation of Arctic resources in
international zones, while bank policies restrict the financing of new
fossil fuel projects in the region.

On the other hand, **[[companies and gov]{.mark}ernment[s]{.mark} [that
continue to invest in fossil fuels in the Arctic]{.mark} could [face an
uncertain future]{.mark}, as [global demand for hydrocarbons
will]{.mark} likely [decline]{.mark}]{.underline}** as countries move
forward with implementing decarbonization policies.

we would spend the next 10 years doing everything we can to convert the
sun and the breeze into the energy we need." The problem, he warns, is
the pace of change. "The idea that one and half degrees or two degrees
of warming represents some kind of safe target is clearly wrong. Because
at one degree, we're doing insane levels of damage. That's why **[we
have to move incredibly fast." That [will require "a massive focus of

fossil-fuel-based economies]{.mark}]{.underline}. "[[I don't know if we

**[[Solutions to the climate problem]{.underline}]{.mark}**, McKibben

The downside is that it's currently very expensive, with estimates
ranging between \$100 and \$600 per ton of carbon removed depending on
the energy source used. So while direct [[air
capture]{.underline}]{.mark} seems to have more potential to remove
carbon at climate-significant scales than BECCS, far more work is needed
to refine the technology.

All of these **[[tech]{.mark}nologies [require]{.mark} both [more
funding for r]{.mark}esearch [and d]{.mark}evelopment [as well
as]{.mark} strong policy incentives to mature, whether that means a
[robust price on carbon or gov]{.mark}ernment [pollution
controls]{.mark}. On the bright side, perhaps [this means they
are]{.mark} more likely to be an extension or complement to [reducing
carbon output]{.mark}]{.underline}** rather than a substitute for it.
Without heavy state intervention, it is impossible to imagine CCS
scaling up over the century to climate-significant levels. The storage
capacity of geological reservoirs is sufficient that there aren't
geological limits to carbon sequestration. **[Eventually, there would be
systemic limits for inputs to CCS---land in the case of bioenergy;
renewable energy supply in the case of direct air capture---and so the
yearly rate of carbon sequestration would be constrained.]{.underline}**

This means that a full carbon-clean up---that is, if the world wanted to
bring greenhouse gas concentrations back to pre-industrial levels, as a
restoration or recompensation project---could stretch over centuries.
But the near-term practical constraints on CCS are grounded only by
political will.

In a best-case scenario, carbon capture and sequestration would be the
world's most massive pollution clean-up operation, conducted as a public
service. But if the public is paying for it, there's an obvious problem:
**[[most of the tech]{.mark}nology [for removing carbon]{.mark}
currently [lies in the hands of fossil fuel polluters]{.mark} who are
already experienced in it via enhanced oil recovery
(EOR).]{.underline}**

With EOR, a well operator injects something---heat, chemicals, water, or
gas like carbon dioxide---into an oil well that's been depleted, which
basically flushes the residual oil out, extending the life of the well.
Perversely from a climate change standpoint, carbon dioxide is currently
being mined for use in enhanced oil recovery from natural sources in
Colorado and elsewhere, and piped to areas like West Texas for oil
recovery. The US already has a 4,500-mile network of CO2 pipelines
primarily for this purpose,13 and the carbon dioxide supply still can't
meet the demand of the oil producers.

**[[Geoengineering]{.underline}]{.mark}**, sometimes termed climate
intervention, encompasses a range of proposed large-scale techniques
aimed at deliberately altering the Earth's climate system to counteract
the impacts of climate change. The fundamental premise often involves
manipulating radiative forcing or removing greenhouse gases from the
atmosphere. Within the context of energy in sustainability,
understanding these methods requires recognizing their distinct aims.
Geoengineering is primarily concerned with managing climate symptoms or
greenhouse gas levels, rather than directly transforming the source of
energy production or consumption patterns.

There are two principal categories into which geoengineering proposals
broadly fall. The first involves Solar Radiation Management (SRM),
methods intended to reflect sunlight back into space, thereby cooling
the planet. Stratospheric aerosol injection, cloud brightening, or
space-based reflectors exemplify SRM approaches.

The second category focuses on Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR), which seeks
to extract carbon dioxide already present in the atmosphere. Examples
include afforestation and reforestation, bioenergy with carbon capture
and storage (BECCS), direct air capture (DAC), enhanced weathering, and
biochar.

Considering if geoengineering [can [**reduce reliance** **on fossil
fuels**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Meaning → Fossil fuels denote combustible
materials originating from geological strata, formed over eons from the
remains of prehistoric organisms. necessitates examining its indirect
effects on energy systems. Climate change itself intensifies energy
reliance in certain ways. Rising global temperatures increase demand for
cooling, particularly in already warm climates, putting additional
strain on electricity grids that often still rely on fossil fuel
sources. Extreme weather events, made more frequent and intense by
climate change, disrupt energy infrastructure, requiring resilient,
often more distributed, energy systems.

**[[Geoengineering]{.mark} techniques aim to alter the climate system,
not replace energy sources.]{.underline}**

**[SRM methods, by potentially moderating global temperatures,
[might]{.mark} hypothetically [temper the increase in]{.mark} [cooling
demand]{.mark}. [A slower rate]{.mark} of warming [could translate
to]{.mark} a [less]{.mark}急 [need for air conditioning]{.mark} capacity
growth [powered by fossil fuels]{.mark}]{.underline}** in some regions.
This is an indirect link; the method itself does not generate energy or
change how energy is produced. It merely attempts to reduce one driver
of future energy demand increase linked to climate change.

At the present moment, land-based nuclear power plants and **[[floating

floating power units; instead, we sell electricity generated by them. As
a result of technical and economic feasibility studies, scientific
research, and extensive market research in foreign countries, we have
[manage]{.mark}d to adopt an extremely economically efficient and, at
the same time, highly convenient principle of operation for our clients.
This involves supplying electricity based on Power Purchase Agreements
(PPAs) with highly predictable costs, extending up to 60 years,
depending on the preferences and capabilities of the customer, [without
being tied to the cost or dependency on hydrocarbons]{.mark}. However,
electricity supply is not interrupted for the entire duration of the
contract, up to 60 years, which is the maximum projected operational
lifespan of the floating power unit. This is achieved through the use of
the RITM-200M, optimisation of the fuel cycle, with a refueling interval
of 7-10 years, and the presence of a spare floating power unit in the
operational \"energy fleet\" during the refueling and planned
maintenance period when the installed power unit is sent to a
specialised base in the Russian Federation. [Seven power units operating

**[Reliable, long-term electricity supply -- [nuclear]{.mark} power
plants [provide]{.mark} [large amounts of electricity]{.mark}
predictably, with reactors achieving high average capacity factors.
Plants built today will operate for 60 or more years. As the
[electricity]{.mark} from nuclear plants is reliable, nuclear can
[directly displace fossil fuels]{.mark}]{.underline}** from a country's
electricity mix, reducing a country's import dependency and diversifying
its energy mix.

Energy density -- Uranium is a uniquely concentrated source of energy
which is easily and cheaply transportable. The quantities needed are
very much less than for coal or oil; 30 tonnes of fabricated nuclear
fuel are required per year for a 1GW power plant compared with over 3
million tonnes of coal. It is therefore intrinsically a very portable
and tradeable commodity. Critically, this means that it is easy to
establish strategic inventories; fuel supply for up to two years is
typically stored at power plants.

Geographical and political availability -- Uranium is relatively
abundant and fuel supplies are spread among politically diverse
countries (see below), reducing the risk of supply disruptions.

**[Predictable costs -- fuel costs for nuclear plants are a minor
proportion of total generating costs. The cost [of electricity]{.mark}
supplied from nuclear plants [is]{.mark} therefore
[predictable]{.mark}]{.underline}** over the course of a plant's
operational lifetime.

Resilient infrastructure -- nuclear plants are built to withstand and
continue operating in extreme weather, as proven during hurricanes and
freezing temperatures in the United States and other places.

Ancillary grid services -- nuclear plants can contribute substantially
to the provision of ancillary services such as flexible operation to aid
frequency control and provision of grid inertia. Nuclear can also help
assimilate variable renewable energy without increasing dependency on
imported natural gas.

**[Heat and power -- for most major industrial heat applications,
nuclear energy is the only credible non-carbon option. Using
[nuclear]{.mark} for process heat can [reduce demand]{.mark} for [oil

Spurring Versatile Power

**[[FNPPs]{.underline}]{.mark}** allow for a wide range of versatile
power applications. Developers construct them on ships or barges as
self-contained, mobile power stations, ensuring they can deploy them to
virtually any coastal region or waterway. This flexibility opens new
possibilities **[for generating clean energy]{.underline}** in areas
that were previously inaccessible for traditional nuclear facilities.
FNPPs can be an ideal solution to meet the specific energy demands of
these regions, such as island nations that need energy for a wide
variety of applications including water desalination, district
heating/cooling, and electricity. Additionally, developers can build
FNPPs with ready-made infrastructure like shipyards.

By utilizing modular construction techniques to construct smaller,
simpler reactors, developers reduce costs while paving the way for the
quick deployment of nuclear power at sea.

**[[FNPPs and SMRs]{.mark} [have a range of potential alternative uses
beyond heat and electricity production]{.mark}, and this chapter will
introduce some of them. These uses can be a]{.underline}** key to
reaching the goal of net zero by 2050.

3.4.1 Hydrogen and ammonia production

The production of hydrogen or ammonia, or both, presents a viable
solution to electricity overproduction by allowing surplus energy to be
converted into chemical products, which can be stored and transported
more efficiently compared to electricity \[20\].

Instead of curtailing excess power, FNPPs could channel their surplus
energy into a power-to-ammonia plant. One way to do that is to apply the
solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) \[20\] to produce hydrogen from
water. Hydrogen can be further utilized to synthesis ammonia by
combining it with nitrogen which is separated from air. The resulting
ammonia is a more stable and easily transportable chemical compared to
hydrogen. Ammonia can be used as a carbonfree fuel, a key component in
fertilizer production and as an energy carrier for long-term storage and
transport \[20\].

This approach enables FNPPs to integrate into fossil-free hydrogen
economies, supporting decarbonization efforts in remote and industrial
regions. By leveraging FNPPs alongside variable renewable energy (VRE)
like solar and wind for hydrogen and ammonia production, energy can be
stored and redistributed efficiently, reducing dependency on fossil
fuels and enhancing energy security in isolated locations. The process
is called Power-to-X where renewable energy is transformed into a
spectrum of energy carriers like green hydrogen, green ammonia or
eMethanol \[20\]. In 2023, about 95% of the hydrogen production capacity
in Europe was based on fossil fuels. Using Power-to-X could reduce the
carbon footprint from production of hydrogen \[21\].

Producing green hydrogen by electrolysis is energy intensive where the
chosen method greatly influences its overall efficiency. SOEC requires
less energy than traditional alkaline and PEM technologies by operating
at high temperatures (675--825°C). SOEC utilizes both electricity and
thermal energy, allowing it to function at lower voltages and achieve
higher efficiency. This 13 leads to a 20% energy savings per unit of
hydrogen produced compared to low-temperature alternatives, which can
increase up to 30% if steam is provided. A key advantage of SOEC is the
potential ability to integrate waste heat from industrial processes such
as ammonia synthesis, NPPs, or steel production. By utilizing
approximately 70% of the required thermal energy from what is typically
considered low-value waste heat and reusing steam internally for the
remaining 30%, SOECs can significantly reduce their electricity demand.
This integration has the potential to lower electricity consumption from
about 4.0 to 3.5 kWh per normal cubic meter (Nm³) of hydrogen produced.
This will not only cut energy costs but also minimize low grade heat
losses, which are otherwise wasted in alkaline and PEM systems that
require 5 kWh per Nm³ of hydrogen produced \[22\].

A standard 100 MW SOEC plant can generate approximately 28,600 Nm³/h of
green hydrogen with steam integration, equivalent to 2,570 kg/h. This
output can support downstream production of ammonia by an additional
3.26 MW for an air-separation unit and 5.43 MW for synthesis of ammonia.
Bringing the total electricity consumption to 108.69 MW to produce 330
metric tons per day of green ammonia, highlighting the potential of SOEC
in decarbonization at scale \[22\].

3.4.2 [[Desalination]{.underline}]{.mark}

[Knowledge of desalination is vast since about 19,000 desalination
plants are in operation worldwide,]{.underline} with almost half of the
capacity installed in the middle east. The most common feedwater is
seawater, with about 60 % of the plants using it. As most plants today
are being powered by fossil fuels, there is great potential to reduce
carbon dioxide emission should they instead be powered by nuclear power.
Desalination is a very energy-demanding process that can use both
electricity and heat, which makes nuclear power a viable option \[23\].
Desalination plants exist on land and at sea, where they have been used
on nuclear powered icebreakers and freight carriers. The maritime
experience comes from Russian ships where the capacity has ranged from
60-120 m3 per day \[24\].

In addition to maritime use, nuclear-powered desalination has been
explored as a sustainable solution for freshwater production in coastal
and arid regions. **[The [integration of nuclear reactors]{.mark} with
desalination technology allows [for continuous large-scale water
production]{.mark} while [reducing reliance on fossil
fuels]{.mark}]{.underline}** \[23\]. The IAEA has assessed various
reactor types including PWRs and SMRs as viable sources of energy for
desalination. Some projects have demonstrated the feasibility of
coupling nuclear reactors with reverse osmosis (RO) or multi-stage flash
(MSF) desalination processes to maximize efficiency \[24\]. RO needs
about 6 kWh of electricity per cubic meter of water while MSF uses about
38 kWh/m3 thermal input plus 3,5 kWh/m3 of electricity to produce the
same amount. \[23\].

//nishant)

[The political nature of energy]{.underline}, linked to the sources of
supply and demand, [comes to public attention at moments of
crisis]{.underline}, particularly when unstable oil markets drive up
prices and politicians hear constituent protests. But energy politics
have become yet more complex. Transport systems, **[particularly in the
United States, have become largely reliant on oil, so [disruption of oil
markets can bring a great power to a standstill]{.mark}. [Access to
energy is critical to sustaining growth]{.mark} in China [and]{.mark}
India -- not only to lift these countries out of poverty, but [to keep
pace with burgeoning populations]{.mark}. [Failure to deliver on the
hope of greater prosperity could unravel]{.mark} even [authoritarian
regimes]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} even more so [democratic
ones,]{.mark}]{.underline}** as populations become more educated and
demanding. And it is [these very factors that have turned the market
power of energy suppliers into political power.]{.underline} [Importers
have come to compete for supplies, driving up prices, supplier wealth
and the capacity to play roles in regional and international
politics]{.underline} that go well beyond the GDP of countries such as
Russia, Venezuela and Iran.

These traditional geopolitical considerations have become even more
complex with global climate change. The United Nations'
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has irrefutably documented
that the use of fossil fuels is the principal cause of greenhouse gases
that are driving up the temperature of the planet. Climate change will
create severe flooding and droughts which will devastate many countries'
food production, lead to the spread of various illnesses, and cause
hundreds of thousands of deaths per year, particularly for those living
in the developing world. Nearly two billion people were affected by
climate related disasters in the 1990s and that rate may double in the
next decade. **[[At the very same time that countries are competing for
energy]{.mark}, they must radically change how they use and conserve
energy. The politics of that debate, particularly how to pay for the
costs and dissemination of new technologies, and how to compensate those
who contribute little to climate change but will most severely
experience its tragedies, are emerging as a new focal point in the
geopolitics.]{.underline}**

**[Ironically, high oil and gas prices and the actions that must be
taken to address climate change -- namely, pricing carbon at a cost that
will drive investment, [new tech]{.mark}nology [and conservation]{.mark}
to control its emission -- [will drive another existential
threat]{.mark}: the risk of [nuclear prolif]{.mark}eration. Higher
energy and carbon prices will make nuclear power a more attractive
option in national energy strategies, and the more reliant that
countries become on nuclear power, the more they will want to control
the fuel cycle. [The risk of breakout from civilian power to
weaponization]{.mark} would [increase dramatically]{.mark}, [as well as
the risk of]{.mark} materials and [tech]{.mark}nology [getting into the
hands of terrorists]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**Renewables threaten energy security---demand for metals and
intermittency.**

//wenxi

**[The [net zero transition is expected to increase dependence on
metal]{.mark} imports [and generate the challenge of
intermittency]{.mark}. As renewable energy takes on an increasing share
of electricity production, new [challenges to energy security
arise]{.mark}. These challenges cause energy security concerns different
from the supply diversification discussed in sections 2 to 4. In the
first subsection, we discuss how an increased need for certain metals
affects energy security. While the production of transition metals is
more concentrated geographically than fossil fuels, there are also many
options in the system to react flexibly to supply shortages. In the
second subsection, we discuss the role of intermittency.
[Intermittency]{.mark}, or variability[, refers to the weather-dependent
fluctuations in the production of renewable energy]{.mark}. In most
countries, [intermittency will intensify as a challenge]{.mark} as it
manifests more strongly when renewables reach a higher share in the
electricity mix]{.underline}**. There are several options to dampen the
effect of intermittency. If they are used systematically, challenges
from intermittency can be addressed effectively.

**[Demand for "transition metals" is increasing rapidly, but these
metals are only needed for expanding production, not maintaining it.
Electric cars and [renewable energy require several times as many metals
as their conventional counterparts]{.mark}. Metals including copper,
lithium, nickel, and zinc are thus sometimes termed "transition metals".
[Electric cars]{.mark}, for example r[equire more than five times as
many metals than a conventional car]{.mark} (IEA 2021). As a result,
demand for these metals is expected to increase strongly. Boer,
Pescatori, and Stuermer (2021) estimate that [prices for these metals
will increase until 2030]{.mark} when they will reach their historical
record levels, [before declining again]{.mark} in a Net-Zero emissions
scenario. [There is]{.mark} thus [a]{.mark} [concern that the
supply]{.mark} of these metals [could]{.mark} [threaten energy
security]{.mark} [in similar ways as the supply of fossil fuels is
currently]{.mark}.]{.underline}** There is however a key difference:
Transition metals are needed only to expand capacity. Once renewable
capacity is built, it will generate electricity, even if metal supply is
disrupted.

#### Renewables create [operational vulnerability]{.underline}, destroying energy security---empirics prove

**Lynch 25**, Michael Lynch is a Distinguished Fellow at the Energy
Policy Research Foundation and President of Strategic Energy and
Economic Research and spent 30 years at MIT as a student and then
researcher at the Energy Laboratory and Center for International
Studies, 2025 ("Renewable Energy Cannot Provide Surge Capacity For

**[[The reduced supply of Russian]{.mark} natural [gas sent
European]{.mark} energy [prices skyrocketing]{.mark} and created a
scramble to locate new supplies. As the figure below shows, a primary
source of that new supply was LNG imports from the United States, which
had been running at 10-50 billion cubic feet per month but soared by
about 100 billion cubic feet per month after the invasion. [Renewable
energy]{.mark} production has increased in Europe since 2022, yet it
[hardly solved]{.mark} the crisis.]{.underline}**

\[Image 1 Omitted\]

Which demonstrates first, that new **[renewable energy is difficult to
acquire on an expedited basis. More important, having domestic supply of
renewable energy provides energy security only
imperfectly]{.underline}**. It is true that since wind and solar are
normally produced domestically, they are not controlled by foreign,
potentially adversarial, nations. If China stops selling us solar
panels, the production of solar power will be almost unaffected.

However, the fact that other nations don't control our renewable energy
supply doesn't mean that we do: **[wind and solar power [are]{.mark}
[controlled by nature]{.mark}. There is no modern Agemenon ready to
sacrifice Iphigenia to ensure favorable winds, despite conspiracy
theories about government manipulation of the weather. Renewables can be
turned down but they can't be ramped up on demand. In effect,
[relying]{.mark} [on renewables substitutes]{.mark} geopolitical
vulnerability [for operational vulnerability]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Which raises an often-overlooked point: **[energy crises
are]{.underline}** typically **[due to short]{.underline}**-term
**[disruptions]{.underline}** in supply, not lack of long-term access to
foreign energy. The U.S. has been a net importer of oil since roughly
1970, but only in 1973, 1979 and post-2003 was there arguably a
'crisis.' Energy crises have typically been short-lived and transient,
solved in the longer-run by market forces (where necessary), but in the
short run by finding additional supplies.

**[[This highlights the importance of surge
capacity]{.mark},]{.underline}** such as the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve. The idea is not new: Charles I in England had an SPR in the
17th century, the 'P' standing for urine or pee, a component of
gunpowder that was in short supply. Being able to provide supply on
short notice is the answer to a disruption, not the long-term creation
of new capacity. Unfortunately, surge or backup capacity costs money,
which is why no one builds solar or wind farms to sit idle in case of
occasional need.

Which raises another very salient point: coal, **[[oil and gas are
geographically fungible, renewables are not]{.mark}. Years ago, Tokyo
Gas' Hiroshi Urano referred to LNG tankers as equivalent to a 'floating
pipeline,' but with the beginning and end-points flexible. Fossil fuels
can be and often are switched from one market to another, as the
Ukrainian war demonstrated. A nation can arrange delivery of ship loads
of fossil fuels, but [you cannot order]{.mark} electricity,
[renewables]{.mark}]{.underline}** or otherwise, except from nearby
producers.

Granted, transoceanic shipment of renewable energy can be done by
shipping batteries. But the lower energy density of batteries makes this
problematical. Consider, a 100-kwh battery contains 341,200 Btu, equal
to more than 300 cubic feet of natural gas. An LNG tanker carries about
billion cubic feet of natural gas, or the equivalent of 11 million 100
kwh lithium-ion batteries. The additional amounts of LNG which the U.S.
shipped to Ukraine on a monthly basis thus would require something like
200 million kwh lithium-ion batteries. This is about ten times what the
automobile industry uses every year in the U.S.. electric vehicle
sales - Google Search

And since **[[there is]{.mark} typically [no surge renewable]{.mark} or
nuclear [capacity]{.mark} available (solar and wind are almost always
dispatched at full production levels), the electricity to charge the
batteries would have to come from existing power plants with spare
capacity, mostly natural gas or coal in the U.S. Thus, the savings in
greenhouse gas emissions would be significantly reduced]{.underline}**,
even ignoring the emissions related to energy-intensive process of
battery construction. Perversely, were such a trade mandated, it is
possible that cheap coal power in China would be the source of the
batteries' power.

There are two main contributions we are striving to make with [our

existing body of knowledge by [examining the relationship between energy
security and economic stability]{.underline} in a global context, while
taking into account the influence of inflation and geopolitical risks
(e.g., war effects). For example, there is a stream of literature
examining the relationships between oil price shocks, energy
consumption, and economic growth (e.g., Alam and Murad, 2020;
Bhattacharya et al., 2016; Can and Korkmaz, 2019; Tang et al., 2023).
There is also a stream of literature that examines these relationships
within specific countries (see Dodo, 2018; Fang et al., 2018; Gasparatos
and Gadda, 2009; Isreal Akingba et al., 2018; Iyke, 2015). However,
these studies primarily concentrate on the implications for stock
markets and return on investment, often overlooking the intricate
interplay between energy security, economic stability, inflation, and
war effects. [**[Energy security is crucial to]{.mark} economic
[stability,]{.mark} as it ensures a reliable and sustainable supply of
energy to support economic growth and development (Ahmed et al., 2023;

examining [the nexus between e]{.mark}nergy [security and]{.mark}
economic [stability]{.mark}, our study [sheds light]{.mark} on the
[importance of]{.mark} maintaining [a secure energy supply in the face
of potential threats]{.mark} and challenges, [such as inflation and
geopolitical risks]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Furthermore, while existing
research provides valuable insights into how businesses are affected by
uncontrollable external factors (e.g., technological changes,
competitions, political factors, and economic conditions), [our study
delves deeper into the complex relationship between energy security and
economic stability, offering new theoretical and empirical evidence on
how surging inflation and wars influence this critical
interdependence]{.underline}. By doing so, our research highlights the
need for [policymakers]{.underline} and stakeholders to carefully
[consider the implications of energy security for overall economic
stability]{.underline}, particularly in light of the increasing
prevalence of geopolitical risks and macroeconomic challenges.

Second, drawing from a global sample of data, [our study is the first to
provide empirical evidence of the interactive effects of inflation and
geopolitical risks (war effects) on the relationship between energy
security and economic stability]{.underline}. Many public and policy
concerns have been raised by the current geopolitical landscape and
inflationary pressures. [**While [energy security]{.mark} undoubtedly
[plays a crucial role in maintaining]{.mark} economic
[stability]{.mark}, the literature has yet to extensively examine its
relationship with inflation and geopolitical risks (e.g., wars, economic
policy uncertainty, and political instability), particularly through
quantitative approaches**.]{.underline} In fact, most research on the
energy security index uses qualitative approaches (e.g., Sovacool, 2012;
Zhang et al., 2021) or offers conceptual discussions on such
relationships (e.g., Bielecki, 2002; Khudaykulova et al., 2022; Sovacool
and Mukherjee, 2011). Although many studies have examined the
relationship between energy security and economic growth using empirical
data (e.g., Balitskiy et al., 2014; Gasparatos and Gadda, 2009; Mahmood
and Ayaz, 2018; Le and Nguyen, 2019[), **[our study]{.mark} uniquely
applies Keynesian economic theory to [examine]{.mark} the energy
security-economic stability [relationship from a global
perspective]{.mark}, focusing on the critical influences of inflation
and geopolitical acts, such as wars. Through this approach, our study
provides empirical evidence that can help policymakers and stakeholders
gain a deeper understanding of these dynamics, facilitating the
development of well-informed strategies to mitigate their negative
effects.**]{.underline}

**[[Using multiple]{.mark} global [datasets,]{.mark} we provide
empirical evidence [from a panel of 68 countries]{.mark} spanning over a
period from 1980 to 2021. In our study, we mainly use five different
datasets: country-level [macroeconomic indicators and]{.mark}
institutional quality estimates, country-specific [energy security risk
indices]{.mark}, global economic policy uncertainty index of Davis
(2016), and overall and category-wise geopolitical risk indices
introduced by Caldara and Iacoviello (2022).]{.underline}** We apply
fixed-effects ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions for our baseline
multivariate analyses. For robustness, we employ several empirical
specifications using non-U.S. samples, excluding countries from
different income groups, alternative measure of economic stability,
additional control variables, and propensity score matching (PSM)
estimation to address potential endogeneity. [Furthermore, we conduct a
set of separate models to obtain any potential worsening or moderating
effects of inflation, geopolitical uncertainty, and wars, as well as
of]{.underline} country-level institutional quality measures.

**[[Based on our results]{.mark}, in countries with [high levels of
energy security risk]{.mark}, the growth in [g]{.mark}ross
[d]{.mark}omestic [p]{.mark}roduct [is reduced]{.mark}. This [effect
remains resilient across several specifications]{.mark}]{.underline}**
based on a non-U.S. sample, national income-level, alternative measures
of economic stability, and a set of endogeneity tests based on PSM
regressions. Moreover, the detrimental effect is mainly attributed to
the countries with pre-existing low levels of GDP growth. Further
analyses reveal that this relationship is moderated by a range of
country-specific institutional quality estimates, such as governance
effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, voice and
accountability, control of corruption, and political stability and
absence of violence. Finally, the damaging effects of ESR are
exacerbated in times of high inflation and geopolitical uncertainties,
as well as of escalating war threats.

However, this complex and efficient system also exhibits inherent
vulnerability and complexity. It is susceptible to countless
disturbances that can disrupt its overall function. Among these
disturbances, climate risks pose a major threat. The frequent occurrence
of extreme weather phenomena, such as devastating floods, droughts,
landslides, and heavy rains, can severely damage production and
transportation infrastructure. This in turn, can lead to interruptions
within the supply chain (Qin et al., 2023). This disruption has
profoundly impacted logistics and transportation systems, leading to
food shortages and commodity price inflation, which could escalate into
hyperinflation (Diaz et al., 2023). **[[The]{.mark} destabilizing

and economic stability must be studied in depth from a global

[Oil is one of the most important commodities in the world.]{.underline}
When transformed into petroleum, it is a key energy source used in
vehicles, planes, heating, asphalt, and electricity. Outside of being a
crucial energy source, petroleum is used in plastics, paints, chemicals,
tape, and so much more. It\'s hard to imagine a world without oil. But
just how important is the oil and gas sector to the global
economy?[**[The oil and gas industry is a key driver of the global
economy]{.mark}.** **In fact, it\'s one of the largest industries in the
world. [In the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [alone, the industry
accounts for 4.8% of the nation\'s
GDP]{.mark}**.]{.underline}Exploration and production make up a large
portion of the global economy, [and the growth of this industry is only
expected to increase in the future]{.underline}. For instance:The 2023
outlook for oil demand rose by 30,000 barrels per day to 101.19 million
barrels per day.The estimate for 2024 is 102.8 million barrels per
day.[**[The energy sector]{.mark}**, which includes oil and gas,
**[employed more than 41 million people across the globe in
2019]{.mark}.** This includes about 6.3 million in the oil supply
segment and 3.9 million in gas supply. That isn\'t surprising when you
consider how countries use these resources, including heating, fuel,
electricity, industrial production, and manufacturing]{.underline}.The
sector is divided into three main segments

Upstream; This segment consists of the exploration and drilling to find
oil and extract it from the earth.

Midstream: These are activities like transportation and storage.

Downstream: This area deals with the refining and marketing of the
finished product

Upstream activities are considered to be the most crucial. That\'s
because, without the discovery and drilling of oil, all the rest would
not exist.[**[The largest global producers of oil are the United States,
Saudi Arabia, and Russia]{.mark}.** **[These three countries produced
approximately 40 million barrels of oil per day in 2022. That is 43% of
total world]{.mark} [production]{.mark}** for a total of 43.29 million
barrels per day.]{.underline}According to market research by IBISWorld,
[total revenues for the oil and gas drilling sector came to
approximately \$4.3 trillion in 2023]{.underline}.This sector is
composed of companies that explore, develop, and operate oil and gas
fields. It is also sometimes referred to as the oil and gas exploration
and production (E&P) industry.The industry includes companies that
specialize in crude petroleum production, the mining and extraction of
oil from shale or sands, and the recovery of hydrocarbon liquids. Some
of the biggest oil and gas players include Exxon, Chevron, and BP.6 The
sector also includes producers that only work in the natural gas field
and those that recover sulfur from natural gas. It does not include
companies that transport, refine, or market oil and natural gas.One
thing to keep in mind is that only estimated revenues from included
activities for companies that perform all operations are counted toward
the \$2.1 trillion industry figure. These companies are also referred to
as integrated oil companies, supermajors, or big oil. [As of July 2023,
there are about 595,700 people employed in mining, quarrying, and oil
and gas extraction in the United States]{.underline}.The nature of oil
and gas exploration projects means that the industry relies much more
heavily on capital equipment than human labor, so employment is not
likely to rise as much as total market capitalization.The largest global
producers of oil are the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. These
three countries produced approximately 40 million barrels of oil per day
in 2022. That is 43% of total world production for a total of 43.29
million barrels per day.[[**Emerging economies have driven demand for
the production of oil and gas**. **This is**]{.mark} particularly
**[true in the extremely populous BRICS]{.mark}**. This acronym stands
for Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. Together,
**[their]{.mark} gross domestic product ([GDP]{.mark}) [was 25.77% of
global GDP]{.mark}.**]{.underline} This is compared to the combined GDP
of all G7 nations, which was 51.87%89.The E&P industry looks to have a
bright future on the back of this demand. Furthermore, there are plenty
of oil reserves throughout the globe, though some of these reserves are
difficult to reach. As technology improves in the future, these reserves
will become more accessible, as was the case with shale fracking in the
United States[.**[Oil and gas]{.underline}**]{.mark} [**[is]{.mark} one
of the world\'s most important sectors. [It\'s also a key component of
the U.S. economy]{.mark}.** According to the American Petroleum
Institute, **[the sector employs 10.3 million people across the
country]{.mark}. The organization also states that [the industry makes
up roughly 8% of U.S. GDP]{.mark}.[The oil and gas sector is one of the
world\'s most important industries and contributes significantly to the
economy]{.mark}.** Demand for **labor is high in the energy sector, with
more than 65 million individuals employed** around the world in 2019.
This includes 8 million jobs in the oil supply field and 3.9 million in
the gas section.]{.underline} **[[Consumer demand and production keep
this sector viable]{.mark}, as these commodities are used for heating
and electricity as well as the production and manufacturing of goods and
services]{.underline}**.Green energy is defined as any form of energy
source that replaces energy derived from traditional fossil fuel
sources. It is made up of renewable sources, including solar,
hydropower, wind, and geothermal. Unlike fossil fuel sources, green
energy comes from renewable resources. This means that their supplies
are unlimited and cannot be depleted. This sector is a key driver for
the economy and is projected to grow significantly.**[[Consumption and
demand for oil and gas continue to make this one of the major drivers
for the global economy]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Countries like China,
India, and Russia are boosting the need for petroleum-based products as
their economies continue to grow while developed countries continue to
experience a boost in demand and consumption.S&P Global Commodity

The response to the 2008 economic crisis has relied far too much on
monetary stimulus, in the form of quantitative easing and near-zero (or
even negative) interest rates, and included far too little structural
reform. This means that [**[the next crisis could come soon]{.mark}** --
**[and pave the way for a large-scale military conflict]{.mark}**.The
next economic **[crisis is close]{.mark}**r than you think]{.underline}.
But what you should really worry about is what comes after: in [the
current social, political, and technological landscape**, [a]{.mark}
[prolonged economic crisis]{.mark}, combined with rising income
inequality, [could well escalate into a]{.mark} major [global military
conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}**.**The 2008-09 global financial crisis
almost bankrupted governments and caused systemic collapse. Policymakers
managed to pull the global economy back from the brink, using massive
monetary stimulus, including quantitative easing and near-zero (or even
negative) interest rates.[But monetary stimulus is like an adrenaline
shot to jump-start an arrested heart; it can revive the patient, but it
does nothing to cure the disease.]{.underline} Treating a sick economy
requires structural reforms, which can cover everything from financial
and labor markets to tax systems, fertility patterns, and education
policies.Policymakers have utterly failed to pursue such reforms,
despite promising to do so. Instead, they have remained preoccupied with
politics. From Italy to Germany, forming and sustaining governments now
seems to take more time than actual governing. And Greece, for example,
has relied on money from international creditors to keep its head
(barely) above water, rather than genuinely reforming its pension system
or improving its business environment.The lack of structural reform has
meant that the unprecedented excess liquidity that central banks
injected into their economies was not allocated to its most efficient
uses. Instead, it raised global asset prices to levels even higher than
those prevailing before 2008.In the United States, housing prices are
now 8% higher than they were at the peak of the property bubble in 2006,
according to the property website Zillow. The price-to-earnings (CAPE)
ratio, which measures whether stock-market prices are within a
reasonable range, is now higher than it was both in 2008 and at the
start of the Great Depression in 1929[.As monetary tightening reveals
the vulnerabilities in the real economy, **[the collapse of asset-price
bubbles will trigger another economic crisis]{.mark} -- [one]{.mark}
[that could be]{.mark} even [more]{.mark} [severe than the last]{.mark},
because we have built up a tolerance to our strongest macroeconomic
medications**.]{.underline} A decade of regular adrenaline shots, in the
form of ultra-low interest rates and unconventional monetary policies,
has severely depleted their power to stabilize and stimulate the
economy.[[**If history is any guide,** **the consequences**]{.mark} of
this mistake **[could]{.mark}** extend far beyond the
economy.]{.underline} According to Harvard's Benjamin Friedman,
[prolonged periods of economic distress have been characterized also by
public antipathy toward minority groups or foreign countries --
attitudes that can help to **[fuel unrest, terrorism, or even
war]{.mark}**.]{.underline}For example, [[d**uring the Great Depression,
US**]{.mark} **[President Herbert Hoover signed the 1930 Smoot-Hawley
Tariff Act]{.mark}**]{.underline}**,** intended to protect American
workers and farmers from foreign competition. In the subsequent five
years, **[[global trade shrank by two-thirds. Within a decade]{.mark},
[World War II had begun]{.mark}]{.underline}.**To be sure, WWII, like
World War I, was caused by a multitude of factors; there is no standard
path to war. But [there is reason to believe that **high levels of
inequality can play a significant role in stoking conflict.**According
to research by the economist Thomas Piketty, **[a spike in income
inequality is often followed by a great crisis]{.mark}.** Income
inequality then declines for a while, before rising again, until a new
peak -- and a new disaster.]{.underline} Though causality has yet to be
proven, given the limited number of data points, [**[this]{.mark}**
correlation **[should not be taken lightly]{.mark}**, especially **[with
wealth and income inequality at historically high
levels]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This is all the more worrying in view of
the numerous other factors stoking social unrest and diplomatic
tension]{.underline}, including technological disruption, a
record-breaking migration crisis, anxiety over globalization, political
polarization, and rising nationalism. **[[All are symptoms of failed
policies that could turn out to be trigger points for a future
crisis]{.mark}.]{.underline}**Voters have good reason to be frustrated,
but the emotionally appealing populists to whom they are increasingly
giving their support are offering ill-advised solutions that will only
make matters worse. For example, despite the world's unprecedented
interconnectedness, multilateralism is increasingly being eschewed, as
countries -- most notably, Donald Trump's US -- pursue unilateral,
isolationist policies. Meanwhile, proxy wars are raging in Syria and
Yemen.[Against this background**, [we must take seriously the
possibility that the next economic crisis could lead to a large-scale
military confrontation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. By the logic of the
political scientist Samuel Huntington , considering such a scenario
could help us avoid it, because it would force us to take action. In
this case, the key will be for policymakers to pursue the structural
reforms that they have long promised, while replacing finger-pointing
and antagonism with a sensible and respectful global dialogue. [The
alternative may well be global conflagration.]{.underline}

Estimating the macroeconomic effects of declines in extractive activity

**[Local [projections]{.mark} are [used to estimate the effects
of]{.mark} persistent, exogenous, [extraction-decline episodes on real
GDP and external and domestic sectors]{.mark} (Jordà 2005). Country and
time-fixed effects control for country-specific and global factors, such
as commodity price movements.]{.underline}**

**[A [typical episode leads to a 1% initial decline]{.mark} from the
baseline [in real GDP]{.mark}, [cumulating to 5% after five
years]{.mark} (Figure 2). The [decline is persistent]{.mark}, with no
rebound until the end of the horizon. Domestically, real private and
public consumption both respond with a delay of four years to the
decline and fall to levels that are -4% and -4.5% lower,
respectively.]{.underline}**

\<\<Figure 2 omitted\>\>

Sources: Bems and others (2023); and IMF staff calculations.

Note: The unit of the X‐axis is years after the shock. Shaded areas
represent 90 percent confidence intervals.

The lagged responses suggest that agents misinterpret the initial fall
as an isolated one-off event and plan to smooth their consumption over
time. **[Only as the decline worsens and extraction activity stays
persistently at a lower level does consumption adjust to a permanently
lower level, as predicted under perfect anticipation. Likewise, real
investment responds with a delay, even though less precisely
estimated.]{.underline}**

**[The [trade balance worsens]{.mark} as real exports decline more than
real imports. The [real exchange rate depreciates]{.mark} slowly [by
20%]{.mark}. The depreciation does not appear to be strong enough to
stimulate sufficient reallocation of production factors toward tradable
sectors, which could offset the decline in exports that depend on
extractive industries.]{.underline}**

**[Effects across industries]{.underline}**

[**We decompose the real GDP response by industry. [Figure 3 displays
the response for]{.mark} the [three largest sectors]{.mark} in our
sample, namely mining, manufacturing, and services. The [mining sector
drops by 2%]{.mark} at the time of the shock and [falls by 14.5% after
ten years]{.mark}.**]{.underline} The convex decline mimics the fall in
production shown in Figure 1. Moreover, the immediate drop in mining
provides an explanation for the corresponding drop of real GDP on
impact.

**[[Spillover effects on]{.mark} the [manufacturing and services sectors
are significant]{.mark} and negative. The manufacturing and service
sectors react with a lag of three years each. Their [value]{.mark} added
[falls by 6% and 5.5%]{.mark}, respectively]{.underline}**. As domestic
aggregate consumption and investment react with a similar lag, the lag
in the response of manufacturing and service is in line with a domestic
demand-driven channel.

**(FF: Fossil Fuel)**

**[Although not the focus of our analysis, one can posit a number of
credible mechanisms through which [FF endowments]{.mark} might [support
economic growth]{.mark} and convergence. We discuss three here, noting
that others are possible, and leave it to future research to empirically
identify these underlying drivers.]{.underline}**

**[Foreign direct investment]{.underline}**

[**A number of studies have found that [foreign direct
investment]{.mark} (FDI) [positively impacts economic]{.mark} growth in
developing countries (Borensztein et al., 1998; Li and Liu, 2005). While
countries with well-developed financial markets are generally able to
exploit FDI more efficiently (Alfaro et al., 2004), FDI is an important
vector for the transfer and diffusion of technology (Barrell and Pain,
1997), which has positive implications for growth. Significant [FF
deposits]{.mark}---[particularly in oil and gas]{.mark}---[can attract
FDI]{.mark} from large, multi-national corporations seeking access to
new supply sources**.]{.underline} A recent study by Melo and Quinn
(2015) suggests that large oil deposits attract FDI to developing
countries even in the presence of other deterrents (e.g., corruption).
Moreover, it is a stylized fact that developing countries tend to have
more lenient environmental regulations; Xing and Kolstad (2002) find
that lax environmental regulation in the host country is a significant
determinant of FDI by U.S. firms in polluting industries. Developing
countries with large FF endowments may be willing to trade potential
environmental degradation from FF development for growth-enhancing FDI.

Financial development

Relatedly[, **[improved financial development]{.mark} may [provide
another pathway]{.mark} [through which FF]{.mark} development [supports
growth]{.mark} in developing countries. Global trade in FF commodities
requires access to capital markets. Countries with significant FF
endowments may recognize the need for financial development in order to
take full advantage of their valuable resource stocks. Aghion et al.
(2005) demonstrated that improved financial development supports
convergence**]{.underline}. In a related paper, Howitt and Mayer-Foulkes
(2005) showed that variation in levels of research and development more
broadly---which might reasonably be understood to include the
development of resource extraction technologies along with capital
markets, financial derivatives markets, and risk-sharing
instruments---sorts countries into "convergence clubs" with similar
growth and GDP per capita patterns. Samargandi et al. (2014) found
evidence that, **[in an [oil-rich economy]{.mark} such as Saudi Arabia,
greater financial development supports growth in the non-oil sector,
[positively impact]{.mark}ing [overall growth.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[Access to energy]{.underline}**

**[[Energy access]{.mark}---and the resulting consumption of energy
services---[is inextricably linked to GDP]{.mark} growth]{.underline}**.
The direction of causality remains an open question. Some studies have
found evidence that GDP growth drives energy consumption (Liu et al.,
2018; Wesseh and Lin, 2018). Other researchers have suggested the causal
relationship is bidirectional (Belke et al., 2011). Ouedraogo (2013)
argues that the direction of causality depends on whether one looks at
the short run or the long run; causality runs from GDP to energy
consumption in the short run, but from energy consumption to GDP in the
long run. In developing countries, **[access to modern energy
services---electricity, in particular---has positive impacts on human
capital development (Kanagawa and Nakata, 2018), suggesting one pathway
through which exploitation of [coal resources might support
overall]{.mark} [economic development]{.mark}. In general, it seems fair
to say that greater [availability of---and access to--- energy resources
supports]{.mark} investments in both human and physical [capital
development, industrial and commercial activity, and technological
progress, all of which would support GDP growth in developing
economies]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

As we look ahead, one cannot help but wonder if this threat of long-term
**[[economic stagnation]{.mark} and decline [will]{.mark} not [be the
catalyst for major conflicts in the future]{.mark}. For one, such
economic [troubles]{.mark} could [fuel]{.mark} political
[radicalism]{.mark}, as it did in the 1920s and 1930s. At the same
time[, rising levels of]{.mark} protectionism and [nationalism could
lead t]{.mark}o far worse [trade disputes]{.mark} than we have seen in
recent years, something [that could]{.mark} also [turn an economic
dispute into a military conflict]{.mark}. Finally, the [battle for
control of]{.mark} strategic [resources]{.mark}]{.underline}** such as
oil, water, land or rare-earth elements **[[could intensify]{.mark} as
economic growth slows, [resulting in conflicts]{.mark} over the control
of these resources.There are many examples of potential [conflicts
between large economic powers]{.mark} that [could erupt in the
years]{.mark} and decades [ahead]{.mark}, particularly [if economic
growth continues to slow]{.mark} over the longer-term. For example,
tensions between the world's two superpowers, the United States and
China, have risen steadily in recent years, due in part to [US concerns
about China]{.mark}'s rising economic and military power. As there are a
large number of flashpoints that [could bring these two giant powers
into conflict]{.mark} (Taiwan, North Korea, South China Sea, etc.), the
likelihood of [a superpower conflict is now greater]{.mark} than it has
been at any time since the early 1980s.This is not the only potential
great power conflict that the world faces today. For example, [tensions
between the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and Russia have also been
risi]{.mark}n[g]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[as the latter seeks to
regain]{.underline}** some of the **[geopolitical importance and
influence]{.underline}** that it lost in the wake of the dissolution of
the Soviet Union. **[[The growing rivalry between China and India is
another]{.mark} [flashpoint]{.mark} that has the potential to erupt into
a conflict between two major economic powers, particularly in light of
the numerous border disputes between those two Asian giants. In fact,
[there are a number of potential conflicts]{.mark} involving two or more
major economies [that could erupt in the near-future, any of which
would]{.mark} not only [be influenced by economic factors]{.mark}, but
would [also have a major impact on the economies of the combatants, as
well as on the global economy as a whole.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

In sum, this **[[statistical analysis shows that]{.mark} an [economic
slowdown increases the likelihood of]{.mark} initiating [military
conflict]{.mark}. Specifically, [economically troubled autocracies act
more aggressively]{.mark} toward democracies whose economies depend on
them. Political unrest also increases conflict initiation, as many
studies of diversionary conflict have argued. However, autocracies
suffering from political troubles do not seem to target economically
dependent democracies. Democracies with smaller economies seem to be
attractive targets for economically troubled autocracies whose leaders
may blame the politically different partner's 'unfair' trade and
currency practices and domestic policies for the deteriorating economy.
The autocracies will present their military decisions as inevitable to
correct international wrongs and reboot the national economy. Meanwhile,
[leaders facing]{.mark} political [unrest]{.mark} may [seek diversionary
targets]{.mark}, [initiating]{.mark} a [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**
through which they can mobilize their support base (and marginalize
opposition groups) by exploiting ideological, religious, and/or ethnic
identities of 'us' and 'them'. Future studies should seek to unravel the
complex relationship between types and levels of domestic unrest and
types and combinations of political regimes, in either t\[he presence or
absence of diversionary conflict. The findings of this study suggest
that an attractive target is not predetermined but is closely related to
the domestic and international situation confronted by leaders who are
battling for their political survival.

Summary and implications

Since the 2000s, many pundits and scholars have attributed two rising
powers' instances of aggression to their domestic problems. Russia's
invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea and its deployment of
troops to Syria, along with China's assertive actions in the South China
Sea, have been seen as aggressions arising out of domestic weakness
(Kaplan, 2016). Some have attributed China's recent provocative actions
against India, Japan, and Taiwan to its struggling economy in the wake
of the pandemic (Myers, 2020). In the post-Cold War period, these two
great powers, often regarded as revisionist powers, have regained their
national capabilities to some extent and have sought higher status in
international politics (Larson & Shevchenko, 2010). **[[What made them
more aggressive]{.mark} in the 2010s? One promising explanation is their
[decreasing economic growth rates]{.mark}. Due to their abundance of
natural and human resources, the two former communist countries had
maintained their increased status relative to their neighboring states
since the 2000s or even earlier. However, falling energy prices and the
reform-incapable structures of their economies retarded their further
growth and increased the burden on their authoritarian leaders, who also
had to manage domestic calls for political freedom and maintain the
legitimacy of their rule. According to this article's causal
explanation, [Russia and China became]{.mark} more [revisionist]{.mark}
actors in the 2010s at least partly [because their economies went
downhill]{.mark}, [and their aggressions were directed at
smaller]{.mark} and more vulnerable [economies]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[A [slowing economy]{.mark} and economic dependence [have]{.mark} both
individual and interactive [effects on military conflict in
international politics]{.mark}. [Slow growth]{.mark} rates
[contribute]{.mark} positively [to conflict initiation, especially
when]{.mark} an [autocracy suffering from]{.mark} a [slowing economy
targets a democracy whose economy is dependent on the autocracy]{.mark}.
Whereas economic interdependence has been regarded by many liberal
scholars as a reason for international cooperation, this study shows why
and how asymmetric interdependence contributes to interstate conflict by
articulating its interaction with an economic slowdown in a dyadic
relationship. Both political unrest and [economic problems have
destabilizing effects on international politics]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
but their effects differ when economically dependent democracies are the
target. Future research should compare different types of domestic
unrest and their effects on international relations with sophisticated
logic and strong evidence.

This analysis shows that economic growth has two distinct effects.
Slower growth makes one state weaker than others and its leaders more
vulnerable to domestic challenges. A state's **[[economic
slowdown]{.mark} not only causes a change in the balance of economic
power so as to favor its competitor but also [increases the troubled
state's foreign aggression]{.mark}, which can harm its adversary.
Therefore, it is uncertain whether one state's economic slowdown
benefits its rival's security. An [autocracy's slowing economy can be a
warning]{.mark},]{.underline}** rather than good news, to its democratic
opponents if the latter maintain economic relationships with the former.
In this regard, economic sanctions may provoke the target leader's
diversionary tactic of blaming its poor economy on the sanctioner. We
can see this pattern in Tokyo's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor at a
time of US sanctions against Japan, which had continued since the late
1930s.

The current global economic outlook is uncertain in the wake of
COVID-19. Although **[[we do not]{.mark} yet [know the
pandemic's]{.mark} long-term [economic consequences]{.mark}, all states
will likely struggle with slower growth and the erosion of democracy and
will engage in more protectionist policies to reboot their economies and
save major industries. In this context, we should be especially
concerned about the risk that troubled economies pose to international
security. As this study's findings suggest, [slower growth causes
domestic problems, which]{.mark} often [lead to]{.mark} the
[diversionary use]{.mark}]{.underline}** of force against foreign
states. If we cannot prevent struggling leaders from using diversionary
tactics, worsening economies in authoritarian states will likely drive
such states into a more confrontational or aggressive stance toward
their economic partners, if not toward political and ideological
partners. We can all hope world leaders will realize that this is a time
to beat a global pandemic and an economic recession, not to beat up on a
foreign state.

### Agriculture Impact Module --- 1NC/2NC

**Strong fossil fuels industry is key to supporting the agriculture
sector**

**[[Increasing food supplies]{.mark}, therefore, [was critical to
raising humanity's numbers]{.mark} and well-being]{.underline}**. This
was initiated with the development of agriculture. Over subsequent
millennia, humanity increased the amount of land used for crops and
pasture (Figure 2) while also improving agricultural practices to
increase yields from both crops and livestock (Figure 3). As shown in
Figure 4, the increase in population and improvements in human
well-being and living standards commenced before the world started to
use fossil fuels in significant amounts. By 1900, an estimated 850
million hectares of cropland were being cultivated to feed a global
population of about 1.7 billion people. Since then, although population
has quadrupled and the world is much better fed, cropland only increased
80 percent. This was possible because of **[the technological
augmentation of nature's bounty resulting from [tremendous
improvement]{.mark}s [in the productivity]{.mark} [of]{.mark} virtually
[every segment of the]{.mark} food and [agricultural sector]{.mark},
from the farmer's field to the consumer's fork. Many of these
productivity increases [were driven directly or indirectly by fossil
fuels]{.mark}.26 Agricultural yields on the farm are driven by
fertilizers, pesticides, water, and farm machinery. [Each of these
inputs depends]{.mark} to some extent [on fossil fuels]{.mark}. [Fossil
fuels provide]{.mark} both the [raw materials]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the
[energy for the manufacture]{.mark} [of fertilizers and
pesticides]{.mark}; farm [machinery is generally run on]{.mark} diesel
or another [fossil fuel]{.mark}; and irrigation, where it is employed,
often requires large amounts of energy to operate pumps to move
water]{.underline}**. [To gauge the contribution of fossil fuels to
agricultural production]{.underline}, consider that a comprehensive
review of fertilizer performance in **[the Agronomy Journal concluded
[that the "average percentage of yield attributable to fertilizer
generally ranged from about 40 to 60%]{.mark} in the USA and England and
tended to be much higher in the tropics."27 Another study in Nature
Geosciences estimated that, [in 2008, fertilizer]{.mark} made from
synthetic nitrogen [was responsible for feeding 48 percent of the
world's population]{.mark}.28]{.underline}**

[Widespread and consistent]{.underline} [access to food makes it
possible to live in a stable society. Without this]{.underline}
guarantee, the incidence of political instability and **[war tends to
increase]{.underline}**. **[There is an emerging body of evidence that
food crises]{.underline}** can initiate political instability5,6,7,
**[increas]{.underline}ing the [risk of conflict]{.underline}** through
various means, such as a decay in the ability of a state to govern its
people.8

In one recent example, the severe drought that struck Syria between 2007
and 2010 contributed to massive crop failures that undermined
livelihoods and forced 1.5 million people from rural areas into cities,
exacerbating existing social stresses.9 Though the drought was clearly
not the primary cause of the Syrian Civil War, it contributed to a
regional refugee crisis that spilt over into Europe, and had profound
effects on the politics of countries across the region, which are still
playing out today.

[Even minor shocks]{.underline} to the food supply [can have **severe
consequences**]{.underline}. From 2006 to 2008, large maize-exporting
countries like Brazil, Argentina and Ukraine imposed export bans, which
together with droughts and rising oil prices precipitated a price spike
of 83%, causing economic instability and social unrest across much of
the developing world.10 Such price volatility in food disproportionately
affects the approximately 800 million people living in extreme
poverty.11

Political [instability is most dangerous when it occurs in countries
with]{.underline} access to [weapons of mass destruction]{.underline}.
Should a food crisis arise in one of these countries occur that results
in civil war and governmental collapse, these weapons [could end up in
the hands of a group that intends to use them]{.underline} maliciously
as an act of terror. The fact that **[Pakistan (which has access to
nuclear bombs) and Iran]{.underline}** (considered capable of
**[producing bioweapons]{.underline}) [are]{.underline}** ranked **[the
25th and 44th most fragile states]{.underline}** in the world **[is
cause for concern that food insecurity in those regions could have
severe consequences.12]{.underline}**

Risks of total food production loss

When Indonesia's Mount Tambora erupted in 1815, dark volcanic dust and
reflective sulphate aerosols thrust into the skies are thought to have
lowered global temperatures by 1°C. The United States experienced
snowfall in summertime and China, North America and Europe suffered crop
failures and ensuing famines.13 We could easily see such effects again
in future after a sufficiently large volcanic eruption or even a
small-scale nuclear exchange.

There is some evidence from climate science that indicates it would take
the detonation of only 50-100 nuclear weapons in populated cities to
lift millions of tonnes of combustible material into the atmosphere and
trigger what is known as nuclear winter, sharply lowering global
temperatures over a decade.14,15 Summer temperatures would drop by more
than 20°C over much of North America and Asia, and would stay
continually below freezing for several years in the mid-latitudes, where
most of our food is produced. Such drastic changes to the climate have
the potential to bring food production to a near-complete halt, leaving
billions at risk of starvation.

While we'd lose almost all of our regular food production, it's likely
there would be some food production via cold-tolerant crops and
alternative foods such as seaweed and algae. Some human populations
would likely survive, though in a vastly different world. The ability of
surviving populations to recover an equivalent level of civilization is
unclear.16,17 (See also our page on risks from nuclear war.)

Catastrophes such as this that result in (near or) total food production
loss pose the most severe risks to global food production. The
likelihood of such a total food production loss scenario is dominated by
the anthropogenic risk of nuclear winter, with the natural risks like
supervolcanoes or asteroid impacts having similar effects but being far
less likely. Estimates of a total food production loss scenario vary
between 1-10% this century, with a risk of human extinction of
approximately 0.1%.

Risks of significant food production loss

Risks of significant food production loss are those that could result in
a 3-30% reduction in our food production capacity. While this might
sound much less extreme by comparison, keep in mind that all disasters
in living memory have been less than a 3% loss. Based on current
research18, there is an approximately 80% chance of significant food
production loss this century. Sources of such risks include:

Global warming resulting in multiple bread-basket failure19;

Catastrophic crop disease to staple crops -- the grass family poaceae
(which includes wheat, rye, and barley) alone contributes 50% of the
world's calories20,21;

A severe pandemic -- pandemics can impact global trade systems, limit
movement of agricultural workers, and decrease affordability of food.
The ebola virus resulted in a significant reduction in regional food
security22, while COVID 19 had impacts on global trade and buying power
of global poor.23 

Loss of pollinators -- in Europe, pollination services represents some
12% of food production, mainly by increasing the yield of fruits,
vegetables and nuts.24 Global agricultural losses are estimated at
between 3-8%  in the event insect pollination were to fail.25

There are also risks of significant food production loss that would
occur via failures of the physical infrastructure needed to produce
food. We rely on a complex network of interlinked infrastructure -- e.g.
electricity, fossil fuels, water, telecommunication, etc -- to run the
industrial systems which provide the goods and services we consume
daily.  Food production, which has become increasingly industrialized
since the 20th century, is highly dependent on the proper functioning of
these systems. This is exemplified by modern agriculture's reliance on
synthetic fertilizers. An estimated 40-50% of the world's population
survives on food produced from fertilizers made through the Haber-Bosch
process26, which requires gas (fossil fuel) and electrical
infrastructure as well as transportation networks to distribute.

Infrastructure is vulnerable to various low probability high impact
events such as High Altitude Magnetic Pulse (HEMP)27, space weather
(solar storms or coronal mass ejections)28,29,30, pandemics31, and
coordinated cyber-attacks.32 Such events could result in major impacts
on food systems.33

[Conclusion]{.underline}

**[Food insecurity is a global catastrophic risk factor increasing the
likelihood of]{.underline}** other catastrophes occurring (e.g.,
**[nuclear war]{.underline}**) [or **decreasing our resilience to
catastrophes. Even if no catastrophe results**]{.underline} from
prolonged food insecurity, such significant [food system **failures**
would be robustly bad]{.underline}, potentially **[causing hundreds of
millions to die]{.underline}**. The complex nature of food security and
the highly interdisciplinary nature of the problem, makes it a difficult
problem to address.

From a political economy perspective**, [[continued investment in fossil

these companies and their influence on governmental policy.]{.mark}
Regulatory capture, where regulatory agencies become dominated by the
interests they are supposed to regulate, enables fossil fuel companies
to shape policies that favor their continued operation. This can
manifest in the form of weak environmental regulations, generous
subsidies, and barriers to entry for renewable energy technologies.
Moreover, the revolving door phenomenon, where [individuals move between
positions in government and the fossil fuel industry, further reinforces
this influence,]{.mark} creating a system where vested interests are

Stranded Assets and Economic Risk

A growing concern within financial and academic circles is the risk of
stranded assets. stranded assetsMeaning → Stranded assets refer to
resources that have suffered from unanticipated or premature
write-downs, devaluations or conversion to liabilities. are those that
have suffered from unanticipated or premature write-downs, devaluations,
or conversion to liabilities. [In the context of fossil fuels, these
assets include **[oil and gas reserves, coal mines, and related
infrastructure that may become economically unviable]{.mark} due to
declining demand, stricter environmental regulations, or technological
advancements in renewable energy.**]{.underline}

**[[The potential for stranded assets poses a significant economic risk
to fossil fuel companies]{.mark} and their investors. [Academic research
suggests that a failure to account for these risks could lead to a
financial crisis]{.mark}, as the value of fossil fuel assets is
overestimated, [creating a "carbon bubble" that is prone to
bursting.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[[The Arctic isn't just remote]{.mark};]{.underline}** it's one of the
most difficult environments on Earth. Extracting oil here requires
specialized equipment, infrastructure to handle frozen landscapes, and
significant risk mitigation for extreme weather. These challenges make
**[[Arctic drilling the]{.mark} costliest [venture in the
industry.]{.mark} ]{.underline}**

Take it from the investors themselves, like Goldman Sachs commodity
expert Michele Della Vigna who told CNBC in 2017 that, "We think there
is almost no rationale for Arctic exploration. Immensely complex,
expensive projects like the Arctic we think can move too high on the
cost curve to be economically doable." 

[**[For companies to even break even,]{.mark}**]{.underline} oil prices
need to hover between \$63-\$84 per barrel. But as the global shift
toward renewables accelerates, oil prices are unlikely to cooperate with
that narrow margin, making Arctic drilling a bad long-term investment. 

Risky and Unpredictable Returns 

Drilling in the Arctic is a gamble. The Trump administration's first
lease sale raised a mere \$12 million---less than 1% of the projected
returns. Many bidders later backed out, leaving the sale as both a
financial and environmental embarrassment. Even BP, one of the largest
oil giants, exited Alaska altogether, signaling the region's diminishing
prospects. 

In fact, the only company that stuck around was the Alaska Industrial
Development and Export Authority (AIDEA) whose leases were revoked under
the Biden administration -- a group with an outstanding track record of
failed investments and wasted taxpayer money. 

U.S. oil industry growth has slowed, with Alaska's production plummeting
from 25% of national output in 1988 to just 6th place today. The
Trans-Alaska Pipeline now operates at only 25% capacity, reflecting the
state's waning significance as an oil powerhouse. 

Domestic Drilling Won't Solve Economic Problems 

Despite claims to the contrary, more drilling in the Arctic won't lower
gas prices or solve economic hardships. Why? Because U.S. oil is sold on
the global market to the highest bidder. Domestic production has little
impact on local gas prices, which are driven by international supply
chains, geopolitical instability, and global demand---not by how much we
drill at home. 

**[[Moreover,]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[investing
in]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[Arctic oil]{.mark} locks us into a
volatile and unstable market]{.underline}**. It doesn't provide the
economic security Americans need; it **[simply [pads the profits of

face unpredictable energy costs.

**[Are we heading for a Sixth Mass Extinction?]{.underline}**

**[Watching the populations of our most cherished animals dwindle is
painful. Year by year we find fewer nests in the trees, fewer footprints
in the soil and smaller herds in satellite images. As tragic as a
population decline is, it's a realm away from the complete loss of a
species. When we are watching a species in decline -- when we have a
downward sloping chart -- we can cling to the hope that we will reach
the trough and [numbers will climb]{.mark} again. Indeed, this has
[happened many times]{.mark}. The [African]{.mark} [elephant]{.mark},
the Asian elephant and the [blue whale]{.mark} were [all on course
for]{.mark} a [wipeout]{.mark}. But we pulled on the handbrake just in
time, and populations have started to recover.]{.underline}**

**[Over the last decade the number of African elephants in Namibia has
doubled.27, 28 In Burkina Faso they've increased by 50%. In Zambia,
South Africa, Angola, Ethiopia, Malawi and several other countries,
populations are on the up. After enduring a steep decline there were
just 15,000 Asian elephants left in India by 1980. Their
[numbers]{.mark} have now [risen]{.mark}]{.underline}** to almost
30,000.

Whether a trend is sloping up or sloping down, there is no reason to
believe that it has to continue that way. **[We nearly always have the
opportunity to turn things around.]{.underline}** But when that line
hits zero -- as it does in an extinction event -- our hopes of a
turnaround vanish. It's done. It's finished. That loss hits differently.
**[Yet it's one that the planet has experienced many times
over.]{.underline}**

**[[Ninety-nine per cent]{.mark} of the 4 billion species that have ever
lived on Earth [are]{.mark} now [gone]{.mark}.29 [Extinctions]{.mark}

**[It's worth reiterating that, if we can keep ourselves to the

currently navigating the most challenging decades due to the rapid rate

### AT: Strong FF Industry Bad --- Warming --- 2NC/1NR

#### No warming impact---the [geological record]{.underline} proves survival. 

**Thorstad 23**, PhD, Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Vanderbilt
University. (David, 1-28-2023, \"Exaggerating the risks (Part 4:
Halstead continued),\" Reflective Altruism,
https://reflectivealtruism.com/2023/01/28/exaggerating-the-risks-part-4-halstead-continued/)

But I will bite. I think Halstead is quite convincing in arguing that
the paleoclimate **[[data does not give]{.underline}]{.mark}** us good
**[[reason to expect climate change to bring
about]{.underline}]{.mark}** irreversible **[existential
[catastrophe]{.mark}]{.underline}** any time soon,
**[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** probably **[[gives]{.mark} us [good
reason to expect]{.mark} that [it won't.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The first thing to note is that **[the earth has been much
hotter]{.underline}** in the past **[than even the most dire warming
projections]{.underline}** predict it will soon become. **[[During
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum
(**[[PETM]{.underline}]{.mark}**) 55 million years ago, **[[the earth
was]{.underline}]{.mark}** an astounding
14-**[[17°]{.underline}]{.mark}**C **[[above]{.mark} the pre-industrial
average, but species extinctions were limited]{.underline}**. Here is
Halstead:

Overall, in the PETM, temperatures were upwards of 17°C higher than
pre-industrial levels and **[the only species that went
extinct]{.underline}** that we know of **[was]{.underline}** a
**[single-celled]{.underline}** marine organism, and **[on land it was a
time of ecological flourishing]{.underline}**, persistence and
diversity.

But if the scorching temperatures of the PETM did not lead to
existential catastrophe, **[why believe that lower levels of warming
will now destroy humanity]{.underline}**? We saw in Part 2 that even Ord
seems concerned by this thought:

The best argument against ... unknown mechanisms \[for extinction\] is
probably that **[[the PETM]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[Paleocene--Eocene
Thermal Maximum\] **[[did not lead to a mass extinction, despite
temp]{.underline}]{.mark}**erature**[[s rapidly
rising]{.underline}]{.mark}** about 5 degrees Celsius, **[to
reach]{.underline}** a level of **[14 degrees]{.underline}** Celsius
above pre-industrial temperatures.

Toby Ord, The precipice

However, Ord suggests that even though the PETM was hotter than the 21st
century will be, warming during the PETM was slower than the rapid
warming we are now experiencing:

Most importantly, anthropogenic warming could be over a hundred times
faster than warming during the PETM, and rapid warming has been
suggested as a contributing factor in the end-Permian mass extinction,
in which 96 percent of species went extinct.

Toby Ord, The precipice

Fair enough. But Halstead has something to say about that too.

Citing Willis and MacDonald (2011), Halstead reminds us that **[[we have
seen rapid warming before]{.underline}]{.mark}**:

a\. **[In Greenland]{.underline}**, **[temperatures]{.underline}** may
**[have risen]{.underline}** by **[10°]{.underline}**C, though this may
be an error in climate proxies.

b\. **[In [the Swiss Alps]{.mark}]{.underline}** and other parts of
Europe, a **[warming of]{.underline}** 2 to **[5°]{.underline}**C
**[appears to have occurred in 200 years or less]{.underline}**.

c\. **[In the [Sierra Nevada]{.mark}]{.underline}** of California,
**[rates of warming in the late glacial may have been]{.underline}** 4
to **[5°]{.underline}**C every 500 years **[around 15,000 years
ago.]{.underline}**

d\. At the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, **[there were
increases of 5°C and more over a few decades]{.underline}** (11,700
years ago).

e\. **[Data from [Greenland ice cores]{.mark}
[suggest]{.mark}]{.underline}** that a \>**[[10°]{.mark}C
[warming]{.mark} may have [occurred over]{.mark}]{.underline}** 20 to
**[[6 years]{.underline}]{.mark}** (13,000 to 11,000 years ago).

f\. In California, warming at the close of the Younger Dryas (13,000
years ago) may have been on the order of 3°C in less than 100 to 200
years.

g\. For the entire Southwest US, a general warming of 4°C may have
occurred in less than a century (13,000 to 11,000 years ago).

Halstead, Climate change and longtermism

Just as **[[history gives us abundant ev]{.underline}]{.mark}**idence
**[[of]{.mark} large mammals [surviving temperatures
hotter]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[than]{.mark} the earth is projected to
be]{.underline}** by 2100, **[history also gives us evidence of survival
at rates of warming comparable to the [worst-case scenarios]{.mark} in
the IPCC report]{.underline}**.

**[Even the worst-looking scenarios give cause for
comfort]{.underline}**. For example, **[[in]{.mark} the beginning of
[the Holocene]{.mark}]{.underline}** (\~10,000 BCE), climate change did
seem to play a role in the extinction of megafauna (large animals). But
there is little evidence of plant extinctions, and many megafauna
survived. In particular, Halstead notes, **[[humans]{.mark} lived,
and]{.underline}** by all appearances **[[thrived]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[during this time]{.underline}**. And as for the megafauna who
perished, a live scientific hypothesis is the overkill hypothesis: they
died because we killed and ate them. (Halstead assigns this 90%
credence, but notes that many scientists may be closer to 50%). All of
this gives us every reason for confidence that **[[today's humans,
with]{.mark} greater numbers, [tech]{.mark}]{.underline}**nology,
**[[and forewarning]{.underline}]{.mark}** than our ancestors, **[[can
survive]{.mark} ongoing climate catastrophe.]{.underline}**

We saw in Part 2 that the only sustained argument which Ord makes in
favor of climate risk is his discussion of unknown mechanisms in the
context of paleoclimate. But, if Halstead is right to suggest that the
paleoclimate data gives us every reason for confidence in humanity's
survival, then we should not have much confidence in Ord's argument.

#### No runaway warming or feedback loops

**Thorstad 23**, PhD, Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Vanderbilt
University. (David, 1-28-2023, \"Exaggerating the risks (Part 4:
Halstead continued),\" Reflective altruism,

4\. Tipping points

Climate tipping points, from Lenton et al. (2019)

As the world warms, we will begin to approach tipping points,
large-scale climate discontinuities that could lead to major increases
in total warming (Lenton et al. 2019). **[Could tipping points put us
on]{.underline}** an irreversible **[course towards existential
catastrophe]{.underline}** by 2100?

The first thing to say is that, as with the paleoclimate, tipping points
need to be contextualized within our understanding of specific
mechanisms, such as sea level rise, heat stress and crop failure, by
which climate change could lead to existential catastrophe. We have seen
that **[[even the most outlandish warming scenarios do not pose
a]{.mark} credible [threat of existential
catastrophe]{.mark}]{.underline}** through any of these mechanisms. So
even if tipping points raise the probability of extreme warming, it
**[is not clear that they provide a new and credible pathway towards
existential catastrophe.]{.underline}**

More to the point, Halstead reviews each of the proposed tipping points
in the diagram above and argues in detail that none of these tipping
points presents a credible threat of human extinction. I will review a
few representative examples below. (Interested readers are invited to
consult Chapter 8 of the Halstead report).

Begin with dieback of the Amazon rainforest in the tropics and boreal
forests near the arctic. Both forests play an important role in trapping
carbon, preventing it from reaching the atmosphere.

Halstead suggests (plausibly) that boreal forest **[[dieback
is]{.underline}]{.mark}** likely to be something of **[[a
wash]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As the world warms, the southernmost
reaches of boreal forests will become too warm to support existing
forests. But at the same time, boreal **[[forests will expand
north]{.mark}wards]{.underline}** into land that was previously too cold
to support them. For this reason, boreal forest dieback is not expected
to pose a significant existential threat anytime soon.

Amazon rainforest dieback is a bit more concerning. Indeed, Halstead
suggests, there is a good chance that human-caused deforestation will
continue to devastate the Amazon rainforest alongside the destruction
caused by climate change. However, Halstead reminds us, most
**[[tropical forests fluorished during the Eocene]{.mark} period, in
which periods were]{.underline}** more than **[[10°]{.mark}C
[hotter]{.mark}]{.underline}** than they are today. So there is no ready
inference from present-day warming to a catastrophic collapse of the
Amazon rainforest.

As Halstead reminds us, the IPCC's latest assessment report estimates
that even on pessimistic warming scenarios (4°C warming combined with
some pessimistic modeling assumptions), Amazon **[dieback is expected to
contribute about]{.underline}** 0**[.3]{.underline}**°C of additional
warming. A catastrophe? Yes. But **[an existential catastrophe?
Certainly not]{.underline}**.

**[What about]{.underline}** arctic **[permafrost]{.underline}**? A
great deal of carbon is currently trapped in the arctic permafrost, and
as the world warms, permafrost will gradually melt, releasing carbon
into the atmosphere. At Halstead reminds us, **[the IPCC]{.underline}**
currently **[projects]{.underline}** that each 1°C of warming will lead
to 18 gigatons of carbon (GtC) released from arctic
**[[permafrost]{.underline}]{.mark}**. That
**[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** roughly **[[two percent of the
amount]{.underline}]{.mark}** projected **[[to be released by
2100]{.underline}]{.mark}** on a middle-of-the-road scenario (RCP 4.5)
by the IPCC. As before, this is a regrettable catastrophe, but hardly an
existential threat.

What about the most speculative scenarios? A rather controversial paper
by Will Steffen and colleagues, "Trajectories of the earth system in the
Anthropocene" predicts that once we reach 2°C of warming, the world will
enter a \`Hothouse Earth' phase, in which even with little additional
use of fossil fuels, cumulative warming will reach 6°C above
preindustrial levels.

Hothouse earth, Steffen et al. (2018)

At the risk of beating a very dead horse, the first thing to say about
**[[this]{.mark} scenario]{.underline}** is that it **[[still would not
kill]{.mark} us]{.underline}**. We have reviewed almost every plausible
direct mechanism (heat stress, crop failure, sea level rise, ...) by
which warming could lead to existential catastrophe. And we have seen
that none of these mechanisms plausibly threatens anything like
existential catastrophe even under the extreme assumption of 6°C
warming.

More to the point, **[\`[Hothouse Earth' is]{.mark}]{.underline}**
rather **[[speculative]{.mark} science]{.underline}**, **[and media
coverage has stretched its conclusions]{.underline}** far beyond those
initial speculations. The model itself is highly uncertain and presents
options for avoiding catastrophe. Here is Richard Bettes, Professor of
Climate Impacts at the University of Exeter:

With some exceptions, much of the highest-profile coverage of the essay
presents the scenario as definite and imminent. The impression is given
that 2°C is a definite "point of no return", and that beyond that the
"hothouse" scenario will rapidly arrive. Many articles ignore the
caveats that the 2°C threshold is extremely uncertain, and that even if
it were correct, the **[[extreme conditions would not occur for]{.mark}
centuries or [millennia]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Richard Betts, "Hothouse earth: Here's what the science actually says"

And what exactly is the research-backed case behind \`Hothouse Earth'?
Here things get a bit hairy, because as Betts reminds us, Steffen et al.
(2018) is an opinion piece, not a standalone research paper, and as such
it really doesn't do the kind of modeling that would be needed to
advance its thesis to the realm of serious credibility.

One thing that strikes me about the scientific literature on "tipping
points" is that there are a lot of review papers like this that end up
citing the same studies and each other ... There is a great deal of
interesting, insightful research going on using theoretical methods and
calculations with large approximations. However, we have yet to see an
equivalent level of research in the highly-complex Earth System Models
which generate the kind of detailed climate projections used for
addressing policy-relevant questions by the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC). Steffen and colleagues have made a good start at
addressing such questions, going as far as they can on the basis of the
existing literature, but their essay should motivate new research to
help narrow down the huge uncertainties. This will help us see better
whether "Hothouse Earth" is our destiny, or mere speculation.

Richard Betts, "Hothouse earth: Here's what the science actually says"

At the risk of piling on, Halstead adds another objection to the mix --
Steffen and colleagues seem to have forgotten to argue for the main
conclusion of their paper: that climate feedbacks could generate six
degrees of warming. Halstead collects together
**[[all]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the **[[feedback]{.mark}
effect[s]{.mark}]{.underline}** mentioned by Steffen and colleagues in
the main text:

Source: Steffen et al. (2018) via Halstead

The problem? These **[[add up to]{.mark} a mere 0[.47]{.mark}°C of
warming [by 2100]{.mark}]{.underline}**! **[[If
feedback]{.underline}]{.mark}** effect**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[are to take us from]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[2]{.underline}]{.mark}**°C of \[**[[to]{.underline}]{.mark}**\]

need to find an additional 3.5]{.mark}3[°]{.mark}]{.underline}**C **[of
warming]{.underline}** after 2100 due to feedback effects.

Steffen and colleagues certainly claim that this additional warming will
occur. But they are not terribly precise about the details. As Halstead
puts it: "they do not explain what might cause the remaining 3.5°C of
warming over millennia implied by their Figure 1".

**[This sort of speculative modeling]{.underline}** can be a good
impetus for future work, but it **[should not be taken as a
scientifically respectable ground for alarmist
predictions]{.underline}** of the likelihood of impending existential
catastrophe due to climate change. **[There is simply not enough
evidence to ground such predictions]{.underline}**.

### AT: Strong FF Industry Bad --- Democracy --- 2NC/1NR

**Authoritarianism isn't an existential threat -- their evidence
misunderstands modern autocracies -- empirical data shows that economics
and international relations constrains illiberal regimes**

Science at UCLA\], The Conversation, "Autocrats don't act like Hitler or

President Donald Trump's critics often accuse him of harboring
authoritarian ambitions. Journalists and scholars have drawn parallels
between his leadership style and that of strongmen abroad. Some
Democrats warn that the U.S. is sliding toward autocracy -- a system in
which one leader holds unchecked power. Others counter that labeling
Trump an autocrat is alarmist. After all, he hasn't suspended the
Constitution, forced school children to memorize his sayings or executed
his rivals, as dictators such as Augusto Pinochet, Mao Zedong and Saddam
Hussein once did. But **[[modern autocrats don't]{.mark} always
[resemble their]{.mark} 20th-century [predecessors]{.mark}. Instead,
[they]{.mark} project a polished image, [avoid overt violence and speak
the language of democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} They wear
suits, hold elections and talk about the will of the people. Rather than
terrorizing citizens, many use media control and messaging to shape
public opinion and promote nationalist narratives. Many gain power not
through military coups but at the ballot box. In the early 2000s,
political scientist Andreas Schedler coined the term "electoral
authoritarianism" to describe regimes that hold elections without real
competition. Scholars Steven Levitsky and Lucan Way use another phrase,
"competitive authoritarianism," for systems in which opposition parties
exist but leaders undermine them through censorship, electoral fraud or
legal manipulation. In my own work with economist Sergei Guriev, we
explore a broader strategy that modern autocrats use to gain and
maintain power. We call this "informational autocracy" or "[spin
dictatorship."]{.underline} These leaders [don't rely on violent
repression]{.underline}. Instead, they craft the illusion that they are
competent, democratic defenders of the nation -- protecting it from
foreign threats or internal enemies who seek to undermine its culture or
steal its wealth. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor [Orbán exemplifies
this approach.]{.underline} He first served from 1998 to 2002, returned
to power in 2010 and has since won three more elections -- in 2014, 2018
and 2022 -- after campaigns that international observers criticized as
"intimidating and xenophobic." **[[Orbán]{.mark} has [preserved the
formal structures of democracy]{.mark} -- courts, a parliament and
regular elections -- but has systematically hollowed them
out]{.underline}**. In his first two years he packed Hungary's
constitutional court, which reviews laws for constitutionality, with
loyalists, forced judges off the bench by mandating a lower retirement
age and rewrote the constitution to limit judicial review of his
actions. He also tightened government control over independent media. To
boost his image, Orbán funneled state advertising funds to friendly news
outlets. In 2016, an ally bought Hungary's largest opposition newspaper
-- then shut it down. Orbán has also targeted advocacy groups and
universities. The Central European University, which was registered in
both Budapest and the U.S., was once a symbol of the new democratic
Hungary. But a law penalizing foreign-accredited institutions forced it
to relocate to Vienna in 2020. Yet [Orbán has mostly avoided
violence]{.underline}. Journalists are harassed rather than jailed or
killed. Critics are discredited for their beliefs but not abducted. His
appeal rests on a narrative that Hungary is under siege -- by
immigrants, liberal elites and foreign influences -- and that only he
can defend its sovereignty and Christian identity. That message
resonates with older, rural, conservative voters, even as it alienates
younger, urban populations. In recent decades[, **[variants of spin
dictatorship have]{.mark} appeared in Singapore, Malaysia, Kazakhstan,
Russia, Ecuador and Venezuela. Leaders such as Hugo Chávez and the early
Vladimir Putin [consolidated power and marginalized opposition with
minimal violence. Data confirm this trend]{.mark}. Drawing from human
rights reports, historical records and local media, my colleague Sergei
Guriev and I found that [the global incidence of political killings and
imprisonments]{.mark} by autocrats [dropped significantly]{.mark} from
the 1980s to the 2010s. Why? In an interconnected world, overt
repression has costs. [Attacking journalists]{.mark} and dissidents [can
prompt]{.mark} foreign governments to impose economic [sanctions]{.mark}
[and discourage]{.mark} international companies from [investing]{.mark}.
Curbing free expression risks stifling scientific and technological
innovation -- something even autocrats need in modern, knowledge-based
economies. Still, when crises erupt, even spin dictators often revert to
more traditional tactics. Russia's Putin has cracked down violently on
protesters and jailed opposition leaders. Meanwhile, more brutal regimes
such as those in North Korea and China continue to rule by spreading
fear, combining mass incarceration with advanced surveillance
technologies. But overall, [spin is replacing
terror]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

In international relations scholarship, a widely-known theory is called
the democratic peace theory. The democratic peace theory in
international relations suggests that democracies are less likely to go
to war with each other. This theory asserts that because democracies are
characterized by a commitment to individual rights and a system of
checks and balances, they are less likely to behave aggressively toward
other democracies. The theory argues that democratic countries share
common values, norms, and institutions and are more likely to resolve
disputes through peaceful means such as negotiation, mediation, or
arbitration. Additionally, democratic leaders are said to be more
accountable to their citizens, who are more likely to resist war and
support diplomatic solutions to conflicts. There is also a lesser-known
theory called the autocratic peace theory. The [autocratic peace
theory]{.underline} in international relations [proposes
that]{.underline} autocratic regimes or **[[authoritarian governments
are less likely to engage in war with each other]{.mark} compared to
democracies. This theory suggests that [authoritarian leaders are more
interested in maintaining power and stability]{.mark} within their
countries [rather than expanding their influence]{.mark} through
military aggression. The autocratic peace theory argues that
[autocracies are more capable of controlling]{.mark} their
[societies]{.mark} and suppressing internal dissent, [which
reduces]{.mark} the [likelihood of]{.mark} internal [conflict]{.mark}
and makes it easier to avoid external conflict. Additionally,
[autocratic]{.mark} [leaders]{.mark} are said to have less
accountability to their citizens, which allows them to [make]{.mark}
unpopular [decisions]{.mark}, such [as pursuing diplomacy instead of
war]{.mark}, without fear of losing power]{.underline}**. The expansion
of NATO and the EU to Ukraine that triggered the Russian invasion is
ingrained with the notion of democratic peace. The argument goes, if we
bring democracies to the countries around the world, then we will not
have to go to war with them. Hence, we should prop up democracies and
support democratic governments. The evidence for the democratic peace
theory is strong. For example, we can see that democracies in the Global
North (North America, Europe, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, and
Australia) are significantly less likely to go to war with one another.
On the other hand, autocratic regimes go to war with one another but
less often. The Sino-Soviet border conflict of 1969 is one example;
another example is the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. Nevertheless,
**[autocratic regimes do seem to develop more amicable relationships
than authoritarian and democratic regimes. In recent years, especially
after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, [the glue in the relationship
among autocracies has significantly increased]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
China is getting more cheap oil and gas from Russia, and Russia receives
"non-lethal assistance" from China. Iran is selling military drones to
Russia. But the pivoting in the relationship between China and Saudi
Arabia is more noteworthy. Traditionally, Saudi Arabia was seen as a
puppet of the US in its foreign policy, which seems to be changing.
Saudi Arabia eliminated the dollar from its oil trade with China as a
means of exchange and replaced it with Yuan. The Iraqi cabinet voted for
the same, replacing the dollar with the yuan. Another shift is China
playing the mediator role between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Seven years
ago, they severed their diplomatic ties and decided to restore them due
to an agreement brokered by the Chinese among them recently. **[The
upcoming autocratic peace is a byproduct of the return of China to the
club of great world powers. [A world with China as the leading power is
attractive for all autocratic regimes worldwide]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
China would not question human rights violations, dealing with
marginalized ethnic groups, gender disparity, etc., in countries with
authoritarian regimes --- treating them as internal matters. The problem
with the US-dominated world for autocrats is that it sometimes uses
human rights violations, women's oppression, and the rights of minority
groups to pressure its adversaries. For instance, The US points out
Iran's human rights violations more often than when it is committed by
Saudi Arabia, which is worse. The US not only ignores what Saudi Arabia
is doing in Yemen, but it also helps it. In contrast, China does not
support one autocrat against another; its stance is more like, "Hey
guys, work out your differences so that it does not disrupt trade."

**The premise of the impact is false -- democracies are not inherently
more peaceful than autocracies**

House of Lords and Professor Emeritus of Political Economy at Warwick

promise of democratic peace,"

Through persuasion, exhortation, legal processes, economic pressure, and
sometimes military force, American foreign policy asserts the United
States' view about how the world should be run. Only two countries in
recent history have had such world-transforming ambitions: Britain and
the US. In the last 150 years, these are the only two countries whose
power -- hard and soft, formal and informal -- has extended to all parts
of the world, allowing them plausibly to aspire to the mantle of Rome.
When the US inherited Britain's global position after 1945, it also
inherited Britain's sense of responsibility for the future of the
international order. Embracing that role, America has been an evangelist
of democracy, and a central US foreign-policy objective since the fall
of communism has been to promote its spread -- sometimes by regime
change, when that is deemed necessary. In fact, this playbook dates back
to US President Woodrow Wilson's time. As historian Nicholas Mulder
writes in The Economic Weapon: The Rise of Sanctions as a Tool of Modern
War, 'Wilson was the first statesman to cast the economic weapon as an
instrument of democratization. He thereby added an internal political
rationale for economic sanctions -- spreading democracy -- to the
external political goal that...European advocates of sanctions have
aimed at: inter-state peace.' The implication is that, where the
opportunity offers, military and non-military measures should be used to
topple 'malign' regimes. **[According to [democratic peace
theory]{.mark}, democracies do not start wars; only dictatorships
do.]{.underline}** A wholly democratic world thus would be a world
without war. This was the hope that emerged in the 1990s. With the end
of communism, the expectation, famously expressed by Francis Fukuyama's
1989 article, 'The End of History?,' was that the most important parts
of the world would become democratic. US supremacy was supposed to
ensure that democracy became the universal political norm. But Russia
and China, the leading communist states of the Cold War era, have not
embraced it; nor have many other centres of world affairs, especially in
the Middle East. Hence, Fukuyama has recently acknowledged that if
Russia and China were driven together, 'then you would really be living
in a world that was being dominated by these non-democratic
powers...\[which\] really is the end of the end of history.' The
argument that democracy is inherently 'peaceful,' and dictatorship or
autocracy 'warlike,' is intuitively attractive. It does not deny that
states pursue their own interests; but it assumes that the interests of
democratic states will reflect common values like human rights, and that
those interests will be pursued in a less bellicose manner (since
democratic processes require negotiation of differences). Democratic
governments are accountable to their people, and the people have an
interest in peace, not war. By contrast, according to this view, rulers
and elites in dictatorships are illegitimate and therefore insecure,
which leads them to seek popular support by whipping up animosity toward
foreigners. If democracy replaced dictatorship everywhere, world peace
would follow automatically. [This belief rests on two
propositions]{.underline} [that]{.underline} have been extremely
influential in international relations theory, even though they [**[are
poorly grounded theoretically and empirically]{.mark}. The first is [the
notion that a state's external behaviour is determined by its domestic
constitution]{.mark} -- a view that [ignores the influence the
international system can have]{.mark} on a country's domestic politics.
As the American political scientist Kenneth N. Waltz argued in his 1979
book, The Theory of International Politics, 'international anarchy'
conditions the behaviour of states more than the behaviour of states
creates international anarchy. Waltz's 'world-systems theory'
perspective is particularly useful in an age of globalisation. [One must
look to the structure of the international system]{.mark} to 'predict'
how individual states will behave, regardless of their domestic
constitutions. 'If each state, being stable, strove only for security,
and had no designs on its neighbours, all states would nevertheless
remain insecure,' he observed, 'for the means of security for one state
are, in their very existence, the means by which other states are
threatened.' Waltz offered a bracing antidote to the facile assumption
that democratic habits are easily transferable from one location to
another. Rather than trying to spread democracy, he suggested that it
would be better to try to reduce global insecurity. [Though there
is]{.mark} undeniably [some correlation between democratic institutions
and peaceful habits, the direction of causation is disputable]{.mark}.
Was it democracy that made Europe peaceful after 1945? Or did the US
nuclear umbrella, the fixing of borders by the victors, and Marshall
Plan-fuelled economic growth finally make it possible for non-communist
Europe to accept democracy as its political norm? The political
scientist Mark E. Pietrzyk contends that, '[Only states which are
relatively secure]{.mark} -- politically, militarily, economically --
[can afford to have free]{.mark}, pluralistic [societies]{.mark}; in the
absence of this security, states are much more likely to adopt,
maintain, or revert to centralised, coercive authority structures.' [The
second proposition is that democracy is the natural form of the
state]{.mark}**,]{.underline} which people everywhere will spontaneously
adopt if allowed to. **[[This dubious assumption]{.mark} makes regime
change seem easy, because the sanctioning powers can rely on the
welcoming support of those whose freedom has been repressed and whose
rights have been trampled underfoot. By drawing superficial comparisons
with post-war Germany and Japan, the apostles of democratisation
[grossly underestimate the difficulties of installing democracies in
societies that lack Western constitutional
traditions]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The results of their handiwork can be
seen in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, and many African countries.
[Democratic peace theory is, above all, lazy]{.underline}. [It provides
an easy explanation for 'warlike' behaviour without considering the
location and history of the states involved]{.underline}. This
shallowness lends itself to overconfidence that a quick dose of economic
sanctions or bombing is all that is needed to cure a dictatorship of its
unfortunate affliction. In short, the idea that democracy is 'portable'
leads to a gross underestimation of the military, economic, and
humanitarian costs of trying to spread democracy to troubled parts of
the world. The West has paid a terrible price for such thinking -- and
it may be about to pay again.

**[[Trump]{.mark} has done more than that -- he has [opened]{.mark} a

chief justice pause. [The president has]{.underline} indicated that he
has [another target]{.underline} in his sights: [the]{.underline} very
[judiciary]{.underline} over which Roberts presides.

"He who saves his Country does not violate any law," Trump posted on
Musk's X earlier this month, channeling Napoleon Bonaparte. The comment,
combined with overt threats that Trump and his people have made against
judges who dare stand in their way, have prompted a question that
previously would have been unthinkable: is the president willing to defy
the rule of law itself?

"We've seen the many ways in which **[[Trump]{.mark} has sought to
[undermine]{.mark} Congress, and now he's seeking to undermine [the
judicial bench]{.mark}," said Nancy Gertner, a Harvard law school
professor. "This is a president who is arrogating to himself the powers
of a dictator]{.underline}**."

For 17 years, until she retired in 2011, Gertner sat as a federal judge
in the district court of Massachusetts. There she dealt with the
defiance of individual defendants.

"I had people who had been sentenced and didn't follow the rules of
their release, for sure," she said.

Not once in almost two decades of service, however, did she have to
confront a public officeholder openly flouting her authority.
"Governmental officials defying the court? It never came up. Literally,
never happened."

Now Gertner is **[observing [Trump's belligerence towards the courts

in American history]{.mark}. There have been people who threatened not
to obey the law, especially post the civil war, but [this is a sustained

from processing oil and gas into a myriad of products that are integral
to daily life, ranging from plastics, synthetic fibers, and fertilizers
to adhesives, dyes, detergents, and synthetic paints and coatings. [The
[market value]{.mark} of petrochemicals [reached 584.5 billion

can be roughly divided into upstream and downstream processing.
[Upstream industries]{.underline} convert feedstocks such as naphtha or

methanol. Olefins [include ethylen]{.underline}e, propylene, and
butadiene, while aromatics comprise benzene, toluene, and xylene.
[Ethylene is the most widely produced basic petrochemical worldwide. In

How Tariffs Are Disrupting Oil and Gas Receivables

**[[The oil and gas industry is no stranger to volatility]{.mark}, but
[2025 has brought a perfect storm of economic challenges]{.mark}. Recent
U.S. tariffs, including a 25% levy on oil and gas imports from countries
purchasing Venezuelan crude, have tightened financial pressures across
the sector. These tariffs, combined with a temporary U.S.-China trade
truce that slashed tariffs from 145% to 30% on Chinese imports and from
125% to 10% on American goods, have created a complex landscape. [While
the truce has provided some relief, uncertainty remains]{.mark} as the
90-day pause ends in August 2025, potentially reintroducing higher
tariffs.]{.underline}**

**[This [tariff-driven uncertainty has ripple effects]{.mark}. Global
oil demand is projected to grow by only 0.9 million barrels per day in
2025, down from previous estimates, due to fears of a U.S. recession
sparked by trade barriers. For oil and gas companies, this means reduced
revenues and tighter cash flows, leading to delayed or unpaid invoices.
For example, a Texas drilling contractor might face a client who can't
pay a \$200,000 invoice because of lower oil prices and higher equipment
costs driven by steel tariffs. Industry reports indicate [that U.S. oil
production could decline]{.mark} in 2026 [for the first time since the
COVID-19]{.mark} pandemic, [further straining
finances.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

In a world of higher electricity demand growth, clean electricity is
stepping up to the challenge. **[[Spearheaded by exponential solar
expansion]{.mark}, [clean power]{.mark} is [set to grow faster than
demand, marking]{.mark} the [start of]{.mark} a permanent [decline in
fossil]{.mark} generation]{.underline}**

**[2024 both clarified and consolidated the shape of the [global clean
power transition]{.mark}]{.underline}**. At first glance it might appear
an unremarkable year, as global fossil generation increased for another
year. However, the main driver of this increase was the change in
temperature between 2024 and 2023. Stripping out these temperature
effects, **[[clean generation met 96% of the demand increase in
2024]{.mark}. Isolating the trend from the short-term fluctuations, it
becomes clear that the world is very close to an era of falling fossil
fuel generation.]{.underline}**

**[2024 also cemented solar power as the engine of the global energy
transition. Global [solar generation increased by]{.mark} nearly [a
third]{.mark}]{.underline}**, continuing its lead as the largest and
fastest-growing source of new electricity. Its [rise was on display
everywhere in 2024, from world leaders like China, India, Brazil and the
EU to new markets in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan]{.underline}. The
[startling expansion and cost reduction of battery storage]{.underline}
offer another positive, enhancing the economics of solar power still
further.

New drivers of demand -- data centres for AI and cryptomining, and
electrified transport and heating -- raise pressing questions about how
to meet rising power consumption. 2024 has shown that solar and
batteries, the new engines of growth, are best placed to deliver cheaply
and at scale, and are already doing so. [While demand growth is
undoubtedly going to be higher than in previous years]{.underline},
Ember's analysis shows that [clean growth is set to outpace it, making
long-term investments to grow fossil generation a risky

Any [near-term increases in fossil fuel generation should not be
mistaken for failure of the energy transition]{.underline}. As we pass
the tipping point where clean generation structurally outpaces demand
growth, any [changes to fossil fuel generation over the short-term will
mostly reflect fluctuations in weather, as seen in 2024 with the impacts
of heatwaves]{.underline}. But [while changes in fossil generation in
the short-term may be noisy, the direction and ultimate destination are
unmistakable. **The global energy transition is [no longer a question of
if, but how fast]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

The significant advances of 2024 were achieved despite unfavourable
geopolitical headwinds. In 2025 those winds are strengthening again,
with an increased prospect of **[tariffs on international trade and a US
administration pinning its energy hopes on fossil fuels. However, while
playing an important role, the [US is not the central driver of]{.mark}
the global clean energy [transition]{.mark} -- this [role]{.mark} has
[fallen]{.mark} more and more [to China]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[China registered more than half of the global increase in both solar
and wind power in 2024 and is the world leader in both clean energy
manufacturing and deployment. There is [no indication]{.mark} that China
is [slowing]{.mark} its own transition to an electrified
economy]{.underline}**, nor that its trade relationships with other
Global South countries will do anything but intensify.

Beyond China, the rapid clean energy build registered by **[[India,
Brazil and the EU]{.mark} is a sign that other major economies are
[forging ahead]{.mark}. Notably, India is rapidly expanding its own
solar and battery manufacturing sector. Meanwhile, [uncertainties over
trade relations]{.mark} with the US are likely to [increase]{.mark} many
governments' [appetite for]{.mark} the clean energy [transition]{.mark},
in regions including Europe and Latin America, because it offers a route
[to reduce]{.mark}d [dependence on volatile]{.mark} global [markets for
coal and gas]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

The imperative for the energy transition is clear: the world is
upgrading from an inefficient energy system reliant on securing a
constant supply of expensive and polluting fossil fuels. In the new
energy system, electricity will be at the heart, with clean electrons
powering everything from transport to steel production.

[**Solar and wind, backed by a suite of clean flexibility solutions like
improved grids and storage, will be the engine powering the world. [2024
shows unmistakably that]{.mark} the [transition]{.mark} to this new
energy system [is]{.mark} [very much]{.mark}
[underway]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Governments and businesses that act
decisively to embrace clean energy and quickly move away from fossil
fuels will be rewarded with a more resilient, competitive, and secure
energy future.

celebrates the truly groundbreaking work by the DOE offices and national
labs with their partners in academia, industry, and local organizations.
And these are just the tip of the iceberg of Arctic innovation.

Take a look at some examples of DOE's clean energy work in Alaska:

Atmospheric Radiation Measurement

At the top of the world sits the Utqiagvik ARM observatory, overlooking
its sister station, Oliktok, on the northern coast of Alaska. From these
locations, far north of the Arctic Circle, researchers monitor critical
data about the arctic climate where land and sea ice intersect, aided by
conventional and un-crewed aircraft operating in DOE-controlled
airspaces. With Arctic temperatures increasing faster than anywhere else
on the planet, understanding how the land-water-air system affects
global temperatures is critical.

Community Energy Transitions

Remote arctic communities have their share of energy challenges,
including expensive and polluting fossil fuel emissions and aging
infrastructure threatened by the storms, floods, fires, and thawing
permafrost directly associated with climate change. To help them advance
clean energy, [DOE's Energy Transitions Initiative Partnership Project
(ETIPP) connects DOE researchers with local experts for 12-18 **months

**[reduced its reliance on diesel by installing solar panels]{.mark}**
using a DOE grant. These communities are setting the example across the
region for community-based energy transitions.]{.underline}

Local Clean Energy for Local People

With a region made up of diverse energy needs, DOE seeks to ensure
underserved communities have a voice in the Arctic's future. In July
2021, [DOE announced \$12 million for 3.5 megawatts of clean power
generation and 3.5 megawatt-hours of battery storage for 13 American
Indian and Alaska Native communities, serving over 1,300 tribal
buildings and saving those communities a combined \$1.8 million
annually.]{.underline} This includes seven tribal projects in Alaska
that deepen the roots of clean energy in the region with residents
involved in their energy future. That has long been a priority of DOE's
Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs and DOE staff have conducted
workshops and provided technical assistance to tribal representatives.

Electrified Arctic Transportation

The need for emissions-free transportation in the Arctic is critical,
given the reliance on boats, planes, and trucks to move people, supplies
and products all over the region. [DOE's Energy Program for Innovation
Clusters (EPIC) recently awarded Launch Alaska \$883,000 to support
entrepreneurs seeking to deploy everything involved in electric
transportation. From ships and cars to buses and aircraft, [the

**[[Several Arctic communities are exploring wind and solar energy
solutions to reduce reliance on fossil fuels]{.mark} and address the
high costs of energy in remote locations]{.underline}**. Therefore,
the description of Arctic Energy Resources must acknowledge both the
substantial reserves of conventional fossil fuels and the nascent but
growing potential of renewable energy within this geographically
critical area. [The intention behind tapping these resources is
multifaceted, ranging from economic gain and energy security to local
community development, yet it is always intertwined with environmental
stewardship and sustainability concerns]{.underline}. The substance of
Arctic Energy Resources, therefore, encompasses a complex interplay of
geological potential, technological feasibility, economic viability,
environmental sensitivity, and geopolitical dynamics.

Intermediate

Building upon the basic definition, understanding Arctic Energy
Resources at an intermediate level necessitates a more granular
examination of the types of resources, the technologies involved in
their extraction and utilization, and the complex interplay of factors
influencing their development. The explanation broadens to encompass not
only 'what' Arctic Energy Resources are, but also 'how', 'why', and
'what if' scenarios associated with their exploitation in a rapidly
changing world.

*Arctic energy resources are defined not just by their presence, but
also by the complex technologies required for their extraction, and the
interwoven geopolitical and environmental challenges that shape their
development.*

Types of Arctic Energy Resources -- A Detailed Description

The Arctic is endowed with a diverse range of energy resources, each
with unique characteristics and developmental trajectories. Fossil
fuels, prominently oil and natural gas, remain central to current Arctic
energy discussions. Vast sedimentary basins beneath the Arctic Ocean and
onshore Arctic territories hold significant untapped reserves. Estimates
vary, but it is widely accepted that a substantial percentage of the
world's [undiscovered oil and natural gas resources are located in the
Arctic.]{.underline}

The designation of these areas as energy-rich regions has driven
exploration and extraction activities, particularly in Russia, Norway,
and the United States. However, the [interpretation of these reserves as
readily accessible and economically viable requires careful
scrutiny]{.underline}. The [harsh Arctic environment poses significant
technological and logistical challenges, increasing the cost and
complexity of extraction operations. Permafrost, sea ice, extreme
weather conditions, and remote locations all contribute to operational
hurdles]{.underline}. Therefore, while the denotation of Arctic Energy
Resources includes large fossil fuel deposits, their
practical significance is heavily contingent on technological
advancements and economic viability in the face of environmental
constraints.

Beyond fossil fuels, [[renewable energy sources]{.mark} in the Arctic
present a [compelling]{.mark}]{.underline}, albeit less developed,
[[alternative]{.mark}. **[Geothermal]{.mark} energy is a particularly
[promising]{.mark} resource [in]{.mark} volcanically active Arctic
regions, such as [Iceland]{.mark} and parts of [Alaska and Russia.
Iceland's almost complete reliance on]{.mark} renewable energy,
primarily [geothermal and hydro, demonstrates the potential]{.mark}.
The sense of [geothermal]{.mark} energy [as]{.mark} a [reliable]{.mark}
and baseload power source in certain Arctic locations [is increasingly
recognized.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[Hydropower]{.underline}, derived from glacial meltwater and river
systems, [is another significant renewable resource. Large rivers in
Russia, Canada, and Scandinavia have substantial hydropower
potential,]{.underline} though its development must be carefully
balanced against ecological and social impacts, particularly on river
ecosystems and indigenous communities. [Wind energy is gaining traction
in many Arctic and sub-Arctic regions. Coastal areas and open tundra
landscapes can experience strong and consistent winds, making them
suitable for wind turbine installations.]{.underline}

[Technological advancements in cold-climate wind turbine design are
enhancing the viability of wind power in the Arctic. Solar energy, while
seemingly counterintuitive in a region associated with long periods of
darkness, can still be effective, particularly during the extended
daylight hours of the Arctic summer and through specialized technologies
designed for diffuse light conditions.]{.underline} Moreover,
considering statement about energy resources, the implication of
**[[utilizing local renewable resources is decreased reliance on]{.mark}
imported [fossil fuels]{.mark} in remote Arctic communities, enhancing
energy security and reducing carbon emissions.]{.underline}**

**Alaska, Canada, and Greenland are [all committed]{.underline} to
renewable development**

With the aforementioned advantages and disadvantages of diesel it can be
seen that **[[a movement towards a transition to renewable energy
resources has started among Arctic communities. Some technologies have
been adapted, but it is crucial to reinforce the momentum,]{.mark} which
has started during the past peak in oil prices[. The number of
communities]{.mark} which are [utilizing renewables is
growing]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Furthermore, on the political side a
movement towards renewables has happened as result of the climate
conferences (Paris, Marrakesh etc.). Alaska announced the aim to
increase the share of renewables up to 50% by 2025 (Allen, Brutkoski,
Farnsworth, & Larsen, 2016). The Greenlandic aim is formulated quite
vaguely: "By 2030, the goal is that the public energy supply must be, to
the fullest extent possible, delivered from renewable energy sources"
(Naalakkersuisut, 2018). Canada has set a different aim that does not
include the amount of renewables. Canada aims rather for greenhouse gas
reductions of 30% compared to the 2005 level, which was 738 Mt CO2
equivalent (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2018).

The article is mainly based on a literature review which provides an
overview of already existing research, and some information used in this
article has been collected during visits for case studies in the Arctic
region. The article aims to give an introductory overview on energy
security in the Arctic. The focus lies on the political viewpoint, how
can the energy security be improved by using technologies which are
currently available on a mature level. First an overview on available
technologies will be given, followed by a description of the energy
policies of the different Arctic countries.

Technologies to harness renewable sources for electricity generation

Several renewable energy sources can be found in the Arctic. The
following section focuses on sources which are widely separated over the
Arctic and where the technology has reached maturity already. The
renewable energy sources identified are; wind, solar, hydro, geothermal
and current / tidal power. A closer look shows that geothermal power is
primarily distributed around the ring of fire -- Russian and Alaskan
costal area at the Pacific -- and on Iceland. Current and tidal power is
not mature yet and in Arctic regions as there can be a risk of ice and
icebergs expected.

Hydropower

Hydropower is currently the energy source with the highest generation of
electricity after diesel; the share accounts for 40% of electricity
generation in the Arctic. The number of hydropower plants is relatively
small, just a few relatively large hydro plants can be found in remote
Arctic communities, mostly in larger communities. That is because the
investment cost of hydropower plants is high and the cost per kilowatt
increases with reduction of the power plant size (Tester et al, 2012).
On the other hand, [hydropower plants have a long lifetime from 50 to
100 years and a low operation cost]{.underline} (Tester et al, 2012).
[The energy output of such a dispatchable energy source is simple to
regulate and the voltage and frequency is stable, which gives the
electricity grid stability]{.underline} (Tester et al, 2012). Depending
on the type of Hydropower plant the environmental impact can be severe,
in particular if a large storage lake is needed (Kumar et al, 2012). In
cases where a bypass to a river is enough, the impact is less severe
(Kumar et al, 2012). In any case a powerhouse is needed, wich results in
land use.

Wind power

[**[Wind power has good availability in the Arctic]{.mark}**, with high
potentials in coastal areas]{.underline} (Lombardi et al, 2016; Alaska
Energy Authority, 2016). The general technology of wind turbines have to
be adapted to the harsh Arctic conditions. Materials need to withstand
temperatures below -40°C, which leads to significant changes in material
properties (Lacroix & Manwell, 2000). Icing on the blades lead to
significant problems which have to be addressed, for example with the
use of black blades which are heated by solar radiation or heated blades
(Holdmann, 205; Lacroix & Manwell, 2000). The cold climate has a
positive effect since it was observed by the US Department of Energy
that wind turbines in cold regions have a 20% increase in maximum power
output at around -37°C (Muhando, Keith, & Holdmann, 2010). As in most
construction related projects in the Arctic the cost is higher than in
temperate areas. For a wind turbine it would be 2 - 3 times more
expensive (Baring-Gould & Corbus, 2007). The generation cost of
electricity is reduced to operation and maintenance after the payback
period: no costs for fuel are needed (Tester et al, 2012). The feasible
lifetime of a wind turbine is around 20 years (Wiser & Yang, 2012). From
a technical point of view, it can be even longer if the operation and
maintenance costs are at an acceptable level. The environmental impact
of wind turbines is related to the land use and the possible
interference with wildlife, in particular bird migration (Tester et al,
2012) (Wiser & Yang, 2012).

Solar PV

**[[Several photovoltaic solar systems are installed in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}**, mainly small scale for residential use or
small businesses up to a 30 kW peak. The production of electricity is
seasonal, according to the availability of sunlight. [During the spring
time it has been observed that the snow reflects the solar radiation and
increases the electricity output of the solar cells]{.underline}
(Boström & Godtliebsen, 2014). Furthermore, [the low temperatures
increase the efficiency as well]{.underline} (Boström & Godtliebsen,
2014). The solar cells have a [lifetime of around 25 years]{.underline}
(Tester et al, 2012). The [environmental impact of installing solar
panels is very low. In most cases they are mounted on buildings, so that
no land is used]{.underline}. In the case of solar farms, the land use
has to be accounted for.

Current policies for renewable energy in the Arctic

The following section discusses the different political aims for energy
among the Arctic countries, which have communities without any
connection to a continental electricity grid. This puts the focus on
Alaska, Canada and Greenland. Furthermore, those strategies introduced
to reach the aims are discussed as well.

Energy policy of Alaska

[**[The Alaska State Legislator setup a Renewable Energy Fund
(REF]{.mark}**) in 2008 with annual contributions of 50 million
USD]{.underline} (Alaska Energy Authority, 2018). The year 2008 was the
peak year of oil prices (NASDAQ, 2018). First the fund was planned for
five years, but in 2012 the [fund was extended for ten more
years]{.underline} (Alaska Energy Authority, 2018). The fund is managed
by the Alaska Energy Authority, which is an independent, public
corporation responsible for assisting energy projects development,
operation and financing in the state of Alaska. The mission is to reduce
the cost of energy and increase energy security. Other programs such as
the '[Rural Power System Upgrades' programme helps rural communities
with less than 2000 inhabitants to increase the efficiency of their
generators]{.underline} (Alaska Energy Authority, 2019). [Nearly 100
million USD has been leveraged since the introduction of that
program]{.underline} in the year 2000 (Alaska Energy Authority, 2019).

Since the introduction of the Renewable Energy Fund (REF) in Alaska
[**[over 280 grants for projects have been assessed]{.mark}** **[and
over 250 million]{.mark}** USD have been **[allocated to
projects]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The fund helped 73 projects which are
now in operation. With the executed projects it is possible to save a
lot of diesel. The total financial savings from displaced diesel are
annually over 70 million USD. In 2018 a number of the 56 projects
supported by the REF have been under progress (Alaska Energy Authority,
2019).

Another program very specific to remote communities is the Rural power
System Upgrade (RPSU) programme, which has successfully completed 86
projects among small remote communities. The average increase of
efficiency is around 15% but peaks sometimes even above 30% (Alaska
Energy Authority, 2019). The increase in efficiency is due to a more
efficient use of the diesel. For example, less diesel is used to provide
the needed amount of energy -- that would result in lower energy
generation costs. Another example would be to recover heat from a
generator and use it for heating purposes. This would not directly
decrease the cost of generation, but the new product heat can be sold,
which reduces the cost indirectly.

An observation shows that modern technology can be a problem in small
remote communities. For example, clean and technically more complicated
diesel engines according to the tier 4 standard are not very common. For
such a technically complicated engine it is hard to find a skilled
workforce in many remote places.

[Alaska has a long experience with islanded microgrids. A lot of
research and development has been done, on a scientific level e.g. at
the Alaska Centre for Power and Energy or by private companies and
utility companies]{.underline}. For this achievement, dedicated funds
have been very important, from the state, region etc. Alaska is, with 25
-- 30% renewables in the electricity mix, more than halfway towards its
target of 50% renewables in 2025. It will be ambitious to achieve the
remaining half in the next six years.

Energy policy of Canada

[**[Canada's energy transition pathway]{.mark}** is based
on]{.underline} four pillars: first wasting less energy, second
[[**switching to clean powe**r]{.mark}, third **[using more renewable
fuels]{.mark}** and fourth producing cleaner oil and gas]{.underline}
(Smith & Coady, 2018). These parameters are in alliance with the three
general parameters for energy policy: affordability, reliability and
cleanness (Röpke, 2013). A problem of introducing renewables are the
high upfront costs on the investment side, which makes it important to
have a strategy to support renewable projects. To increase the
attractiveness of such projects the 'generation energy council report'
recommends the introduction of capital cost depreciation, strategic
initiatives and other tax treatments (Smith & Coady, 2018). Moreover,
existing funds and investment programs should be streamlined and the
access to them should be extended (Smith & Coady, 2018). To support the
transition, subsidies for the use of fossil fuels in an inefficient way
for electricity generation will phase out in 2025 (Environment and
Climate Change Canada, 2017).

The Canadian government's aim is to reduce the 2005 CO2 by 30% until the
year 2030, which would entail a maximum CO2 emission of 500 Mt CO2. The
long-term goal is even more ambitious with a reduction of 80% compared
to 2005 by the year 2050. The CO2 emission of 2017 was 716 Mt CO2, a
reduction of 2.9% compared to the 738 MT CO2 in 2005. In other terms it
means that approximately 8% of the aimed reduction of 220 Mt CO2 was
reached after 2 years. To reach this aim Canada has introduced several
programmes to support renewable projects. [The 'Energy Innovation
Program' has **[allocated 49 million]{.mark}** USD in over three years.
The program is set up **[to support innovation]{.mark}s [for clean
energy]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The 'Canadian Renewable and Conservation
Expenses' program is more consumer orientated, with the target group of
industry. The program allows the write-off of equipment associated with
producing clean energy with 30 -- 50% per year. The common depreciation
rate without the program would be 4 -- 20 % per year for such equipment.
The 'Green Infrastructure Program' has a sub-category, which focuses on
'Clean Energy for Rural and remote Communities'. [The goal is **[to
reduce dependency on diesel]{.mark}** and establish local and clean
sources such as wind, solar, biomass and hydropower.]{.underline}

Canada has just done a little step towards the aimed CO2 reduction in
the first years. But it has to be considered that the supporting
programs have to be first set up and introduced, and such projects take
time before they show some effect. There are eleven more years to reach
the aim. The funding options are relatively new, and they seem to be a
mix aiming for research and development and for integration of
renewables.

Energy policy of Greenland

The aim of the [Greenlandic]{.underline} government is very vague, but
the large [communities are powered by hydropower]{.underline}. This
makes the [renewable portion of the total energy mix very strong with
around 70%]{.underline} (WWF, 2017). In [2016 the first solar test side
was opened and in 2018 the first wind turbine was erected in Greenland.
Private consumers have been much more open to solar power]{.underline}.
Several small-scale solar systems can be found on residential buildings.

Comparison of energy policies among the Arctic countries

A comparison of the hydropower electricity generation in the different
countries shows on a first look that Greenland produces more than 70% of
its electricity by using renewables (WWF, 2017). In Canada it is around
66% renewables (Natural Resources Canada, 2018). USA is far behind with
25 -- 30% renewables, but these numbers are on a country level (EIA,
2019). A breakdown on just remote areas draws a different picture. In
Greenland all communities are remote, so nothing changes. But a look on
Canadian remote communities shows that just 25% of all remote
communities can supplement the diesel electricity generation with
renewables. In Alaska 15% of all remote communities harvest a portion of
the electricity from renewables. The lower use of renewables in remote
places can be associated with the high investment cost for renewable
power projects.

It can be seen that renewables are a viable option to support
electricity generation and lower the carbon footprint of society. The
introduction of renewables has a positive effect on electricity prices.
It is among the Arctic communities that the highest electricity prices
around the world can be found. For example, in Alaska prices can be 2 --
5 times higher compared to the lower 48.

Conclusion

At the current stage [**[there is mature technology available to power
entire Arctic communities by renewables]{.mark}** like hydropower, or at
least to supplement the electricity mix with renewable energy such as
wind and solar]{.underline}. It is important to assess the local
circumstances, which natural resources are available and which amount
can be harnessed. Moreover, it has to be analysed if renewable energy
can be harnessed in an economically viable way and cost-effective
policies introduced to facilitate the transition. **[[Alaska and
Greenland]{.mark} have [already implemented policies to support]{.mark}
directly the use of [renewable]{.mark} energy resources. [Canada]{.mark}
is however focusing directly on the [reduc]{.mark}tion of greenhouse gas
[emissions, which]{.mark} will [lead to]{.mark} an increase of low
carbon technologies such as [renewables]{.mark}. To reach these goal's
several initiatives have been started by the governments]{.underline}**,
reaching from a country wide approach up to specific programs just for
rural Arctic communities. Overall it can however be seen that the share
of renewable energy in the Arctic is still very low.

[Sustainable energy technologies are at a point of development where the
integration in to Arctic electricity systems is feasible]{.underline}.
The use of local energy sources can increase the energy security in
communities and lower the cost of energy. For the small communities such
projects are often very complicated to execute because of the high

is however possible for the communities to adjust the output in

more energy. The [policies that have already been introduced are helpful

**Geothermal exploration in Alaska is [ramping up]{.underline} --
[dual]{.underline} state and federal efforts expands incentives**

geothermal lease sale at Cook Inlet volcano,"

**[[Alaska officials]{.mark} are preparing to [hold]{.mark} a lease
[sale for geothermal]{.mark} exploration [rights]{.mark} at Augustine
Volcano, a 4,133-foot peak that forms its own cone-shaped island
[in]{.mark} the southern part of [Cook Inlet]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

The Alaska Division of Oil and Gas, which manages the state's geothermal
program, issued a formal finding on Jan. 10 concluding that a geothermal
lease sale at Augustine would be in the state's best interest. Such
findings are required as precursors to lease sales.

Division officials hope to hold the Augustine lease sale as soon as
possible, said Sean Clifton, a spokesperson for the division. A further
announcement could come as early as this spring, he said.

Augustine lies about 175 miles southwest of Anchorage and about 70 miles
southwest of the Kenai Peninsula city of Homer. Its last eruptions came
in a series that stretched over about three months in late 2005 and
early 2006, according to the federal-state Alaska Volcano Observatory.

Geothermal energy projects use the heat beneath the earth's surface.
There have been some geothermal projects that have successfully tapped
into energy at volcanic sites in the Lower 48, notably in Nevada, where
a power plant located on a volcano's flank has been operating for
decades.

An upcoming Augustine geothermal lease sale **[would offer up to 55,771
acres in 24 tracts, all on the north side of the island and in nearby
offshore areas, according to the best interest finding.]{.underline}**

**[The south side of the island would not be available. Anchorage-based
GeoAlaska LLC already holds geothermal prospecting permits for that part
of Augustine, obtaining the first permit from the Division of Oil and
Gas in 2022 and adding to it two years later.]{.underline}**

**[So far, three [companies]{.mark} have notified the Division of Oil
and Gas that they [are interested in exploring geothermal
resources]{.mark} at Augustine [beyond]{.mark} the area permitted to
Geo[Alaska]{.mark},]{.underline}** Clifton said. Those expressions of
interest are what led to plans for a lease sale, he said.

The first of those companies submitted a proposal that the Division of
Oil and Gas received in mid-July. In response to the division's call for
public comments, two more companies came forward with competing
proposals.

That led to the lease sale process being carried out under the state's
geothermal program, Clifton said. "Because there is competing interest,
we have to do a competitive lease sale," he said.

The coastline area along the Gulf of Alaska is teeming with active
volcanoes, and companies and government officials have tried for decades
to harness some of the geothermal energy they hold.

Most interest has been focused on the volcanoes closes to population
centers: 11,069-foot Mount Spurr, located about 70 miles west of
Anchorage; 5,905-foot Makushin, 16 miles from the busy fishing port of
Unalaska/Dutch Harbor; and Augustine.

Although there has been exploration of varying levels at those
volcanoes, there has been no energy production at any. There has been
more **[[success in Alaska with geothermal energy derived from hot
springs]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[East of Fairbanks, the Chena Hot Springs resort uses the same
geothermal energy that heats its pools to fuel electricity, heat
buildings and keep food-producing greenhouse operating.]{.underline}**

**[North of Nome, the heat from Pilgrim Hot Springs has been used since
the early 1900s to support food-producing gardens]{.underline}**; a
modern gardening and greenhouse operation there supplies local produce
to Nome consumers.

Past experience shows that tapping into geothermal energy from volcanoes
is difficult, Clifton said. He cautioned that the results of any
upcoming lease sale are uncertain.

"The initial interest doesn't always materialize into bidding, so I
don't want to oversell," Clifton said. "Drilling into a volcano, that's
hard. On an island."In the case of Augustine, potential explorers face
numerous safety risks that are listed in the best interest finding,
including explosive, ash- or lava-producing eruptions, mudslides,
landslides and tsunamis. Explorers would also have to take steps to
reduce risks to the area's fish and wildlife habitat, according to the
finding.

The Augustine leasing is being planned under the state's long-standing
program and is unrelated to any changes created through a **[broad
energy bill that the Legislature passed and Gov. Mike [Dunleavy signed
into law]{.mark} last year.]{.underline}**

**[That bill, [House Bill 50]{.mark}, focused more on Cook Inlet and
Railbelt energy issues, but it [included]{.mark} some
[provisions]{.mark} that are [aimed at making geothermal exploration
more attractive]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Regulations have not yet been
completed to enact the changes authorized by that legislation.

Although the potential Augustine lease sale is not affected by that
state legislation, new federal legislation might make geothermal energy
development there and elsewhere more attractive than it was in the past,
the best interest finding noted.

**[The [I]{.mark}nflation [R]{.mark}eduction [A]{.mark}ct of 2022
[includes federal tax credits for geothermal power plants]{.mark} and
manufacturers of geothermal technologies. There are also opportunities
to get loan guarantees for new projects, the document said. "In sum,
[federal energy policy has shifted significantly]{.mark} since the other
noncompetitive permits were issued, [which]{.mark} has [generated
renewed interest in geothermal exploration]{.mark}," the finding
said.]{.underline}**

### No Link --- Geoengineering --- 1AR

#### Status quo geoengineering projects thump and geoengineering doesn't kill the fossil fuel industry. Both can co-exist.

**[[Governments worldwide are searching for ways to decarbonise and
tackle climate change, while many continue to rely heavily on fossil
fuels for their energy]{.mark}. This has led [several countries]{.mark}
to [explore]{.mark} the potential for [geoengineering to combat climate

fossil fuels]{.mark} to renewable alternatives. However, while [some
experiments are showing promise]{.mark}]{.underline}**, it is still
unclear how effective many geoengineering activities are, and some are
concerned about the potential secondary effects of these projects.

**[[Geoengineering]{.mark} refers to deliberate, large-scale
interventions in Earth\'s natural systems to counteract climate change
or mitigate its effects. These interventions are broadly divided into
two groups, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and solar radiation management
(SRM). Carbon capture and storage ([CCS) operations are]{.mark} already
in place in several countries around the globe, [supported by the recent
rise in investment in CCS technology by oil and gas companies looking to
decarbonise operations]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} Other CDR
methods include ocean geoengineering, afforestation, and enhanced rock
weathering.

**[[The Australian Government is funding]{.mark} dangerous [cloud
brightening experiments]{.mark} on the Great Barrier Reef [through a
trust set up by fossil fuel industry]{.mark}]{.underline}** executives.

In 2018, Australians raised our collective eyebrows when then Prime
Minister Malcolm Turnbull awarded \$444 million to a small private
charity -- the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, without departmental
oversight, or going through a competitive tender process.1

A subsequent Senate Inquiry into the matter concluded that: \"The
granting of \$444 million to the Foundation was a highly irresponsible
decision, hastily concocted by relevant ministers, without proper
consideration of risks and potential effectiveness, no consultation with
key stakeholders, and without having undertaken due diligence.\"2

The Inquiry also raised concerns that the focus of the Foundation
Partnership would not be on the key underlying environmental problems ‒
such as climate change ‒ that are the root cause of the poor health of
the Reef. The Inquiry recommended that the most appropriate course of
action was to terminate the Partnership.3 Needless to say this hasn\'t
happened.

Project breaches UN geoengineering moratorium

Earlier this year, scientists from the Foundation\'s Reef Restoration
and Adaptation Program created international controversy by conducting
cloud brightening experiments on the Great Barrier Reef. The move defied
an international moratorium on the deployment of geoengineering
technologies.

Geoengineering is the large-scale manipulation of the environment. The
profound risks associated with geoengineering proposals include further
disruption of the global climate; unknown feedback effects; floods and
droughts in the global south; and its potential to be weaponised by
powerful countries.4 For this reason, in 2010, the UN Convention on
Biological Diversity ruled that \"no geoengineering activities should be
carried out\" until a \"global, transparent and effective control and
regulatory mechanisms for geo-engineering, in accordance with the
precautionary approach\" can be put in place. The decision allows
exceptions for \"small-scale experiments\" on several conditions,
including that they are conducted under \"controlled settings\" -- which
was not the case with the Australian experiment. 

The Australian experiment, led by the Southern Cross University and the
Sydney Institute of Marine Science, was conducted over a four-day period
in a southern part of the Great Barrier Reef. The scientists used a
modified turbine to spray trillions of nano-sized ocean salt crystals
into the air from the back of a barge. In theory, the tiny salt crystals
will mix with low-altitude clouds, making them brighter and reflecting
more sunlight away from the ocean surface -- creating a localised
cooling effect.

Next year, the team plans to test the technology at three times the
scale, ready for a 10-fold increase a year later, which the researchers
say should be able to brighten clouds across a 400 km2 area. According
to the Reef Trust Partnership Annual Work Plan, \$6.63million has been
allocated to solar radiation management research this year.5

The open-air testing of solar geoengineering technology in Australia
sets a particularly dangerous new precedent, opening a path to the use
of a risky technology that, if deployed at large scale, could be
damaging to other regions and even the ocean ecosystems the researchers
claim to be trying to protect.

Marine Cloud Brightening is an expensive, risky technofix

MCB and other solar geoengineering technologies are risky, unproven
technofixes that divert attention away from the need for real action on
climate change. This is why [**[fossil fuel companies have been funding
research into]{.mark} solar [geoengineering for
decades]{.mark}**.]{.underline}6 It also explains the Coalition
Government\'s enthusiasm for the project.

In April this year the Federal Government committed \$100 million to the
Great Barrier Foundation\'s Reef Restoration and Adaptation Science
Program (of which the MCB experiment is a component). \$100 million will
come from in-kind contributions from the research institutions involved,
and they are hoping to raise \$100 million from the private sector.7

**[Our results suggest that climate change impacts on Arctic sea-ice

production, due to the simultaneous effect of reduction in

up[on the reaction of other suppliers]{.mark} to the world oil

CRS estimates -- again, based on hypothetical and uncertain scenarios --
that peak plateau production from economically recoverable volumes of
3.90 billion and 10.74 billion bbls (based upon \$55 per barrel in 2003
dollars, or about \$58 in 2005 dollars) would range from roughly 0.4
million to 1.6 million bbls per day, assuming pipeline capacity imposes
no constraints. Production could begin within 10 years, and could last
at least 30 years, declining from the peak. If exploration starts in
2006, peak production levels probably would be reached in about 2025.

2025.10 On the basis of the aforementioned scenarios, [ANWR
production]{.underline} (from the respective discovery volumes) [at

While a precarious ceasefire is currently holding between Iran and
Isreal, the escalating conflict between the two nations in recent weeks
has brought global energy security back into the spotlight. 

In response to US attacks on its nuclear facilities, Iran threatened to
close the Strait of Hormuz, a vital shipping passage for global energy
supplies.

Such a move has the potential to disrupt access to fossil fuels for
countries around the world and send energy prices soaring. Roughly 20%
of the world\'s liquefied natural gas and almost 27% of its crude oil
passes through the narrow waterway connecting the Persian Gulf to the
Gulf of Oman.

crucial]{.mark} not only for the climate but [for energy
security]{.mark}, with homegrown renewables offering stable power amid
geopolitical tensions.]{.underline}**

What is energy security and why is it important?

Energy security refers to uninterrupted access to power at an affordable
price, according to the autonomous intergovernmental International
Energy Agency.

**[The lifeblood of modern economies, [energy is vital for
everything]{.mark} from manufacturing, transport and communication, to
education and agriculture.]{.underline}**

**[As such, [disruptions to supply can bring industries grinding to a
halt]{.mark},]{.underline}** hinder essential services like health care,
and even compromise national security by hampering military operations.

In the 1970s, **[[disruptions to oil exports]{.mark} [led to sharp rises
in prices]{.mark} and long lines at gas stations, shaking the global
economy. More recently, [the energy crisis following Russia\'s 2022
invasion]{.mark} of Ukraine [revealed]{.mark} [Europe\'s energy
vulnerability]{.mark} due to its reliance on imported Russian
gas.]{.underline}**

**[Are renewables more stable than fossil fuels?]{.underline}**

**[The latest [Iran-Israel]{.mark} conflict has further [underlined the
global dependence on oil imports]{.mark}]{.underline}**, according to
experts at the UK-based energy think tank Ember.

According to their analysis of IEA data, 79% of the world\'s population
lives in oil-importing countries, with 62 sourcing all of their oil from
other countries. Ninety nations --- including Spain, South Korea,
Germany, Turkey and India --- rely on imports for more than 80% of their
needs.

\<\<image omitted\>\>

**[In climates of unstable global trade and mounting geopolitical
tensions, [such reliance on imports]{.mark} can [lead to energy security
risks]{.mark}, said Ember. Any [upset in fossil fuel markets causes
price volatility]{.mark} for all countries reliant on oil and
gas. ]{.underline}**

**[[Renewables]{.mark}, experts say, can [offer a stable and secure
alternative]{.mark}. [They can]{.mark} generate power within a
country\'s borders or nearby neighboring countries, thereby
[shield]{.mark}ing [against price volatility or geopolitical
risks]{.mark}. [Diversifying power supply]{.mark} options [is]{.mark}
seen as [a key part]{.mark} [of a resilient energy
system]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

No place like home --- even for energy

Research from the International Monetary Fund also indicates that over
the past decades, most fossil-fuel producing countries have become more
politically risky and exhibited less democratic freedoms.

[\"The more we have home grown energy sources, the
better,\"]{.underline} said Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA,
emphasizing the need to secure energy \"not from one single country, not
from one single trade route, and not from one single company.\"

electrified," Davis said.

Oil-rich nations including Russia and Saudi Arabia are among the
minority of countries that would see energy security decline in net-zero
scenarios even with expanded trade networks.

Most people are focused on the new stuff that could be a problem, and
not really considering the security benefits of moving away from fossil

Systematic analysis and a new trade risk index

**[[To reach their conclusions, the scientists]{.mark} systematically
[analyzed the range of each country's]{.mark} potential [new
vulnerabilities]{.mark} under decarbonization relative to those
associated with continued reliance on fossil fuels. ]{.underline}**

As a first step, lead author Jing Cheng, a postdoctoral scholar in
Davis's Sustainable Solutions Lab at Stanford, built a database of
countries with reserves of oil, gas, coal, uranium, biofuels, and any of
16 materials that are critical for clean energy technologies, along with
the trade flows of these resources between countries. 

**[[The researchers calculated how much]{.mark} of these resources
[would be required to meet]{.mark} energy [demand]{.mark} in each of 236
countries in 1,092 different scenarios for reaching net-zero carbon
emissions globally by 2060. Modeled by the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change, or IPCC, the scenarios span a broad range of possible
changes to the energy mix across the globe and within individual
countries. Some are more dependent on nuclear energy, for example, while
others incorporate more solar or wind power. ]{.underline}**

For the thousands of combinations of trade relationships and resource
needs, the team estimated the level of risk in each country's
transportation and electricity sectors, and overall energy system. They
quantified these risks using a new "trade risk index" based on the
availability of domestic reserves, the share of demand for a given fuel
or material met by imports, the economic value of the imports, and
a measure of market concentration widely used to quantify energy
security.

**[[Countries benefit from deeper cuts to fossil fuel
reliance]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[[The researchers found]{.mark} that if all countries maintain their
current networks, trade-related risks to energy security would decline
on average by 19% in net-zero scenarios[. If countries expand their
networks]{.mark} and trade [with all resource owners, then]{.mark} trade
[risks on average would fall by half.]{.mark} ]{.underline}**

**[[Embracing nuclear]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nology will [enable]{.mark}
the [maritime sector to move into]{.mark} a new [era of
prosperity]{.mark} through clean energy]{.underline}**

**[The nature of the shipping industry is changing. The maritime sector
is on the brink of a transformation as great as that between the age of
sail and the adoption of steam propulsion. But while some present this
challenge as an onerous burden, it in fact presents a huge opportunity
--to revolutionize port operations and shipping, while making them more
efficient and more cost effective.]{.underline}**

Ports and shipping companies, like the rest of society, rely on the vast
benefits that fossil fuels provide. But the industry is mandated to move
away from these fuels over the coming decades. So, we need to find a
complementary replacement over time that provides abundant energy --
and, importantly, provide that energy on demand and at low cost.

Some have proposed synthetic 'green' fuels as a solution, but they are
neither complementary nor a viable replacement for fossil fuels.
Synthetic liquid fuels (such as ammonia and methanol) are produced using
electricity from low- or zero-carbon sources. Although synthetic fuels
could be used in combustion engines, producing them efficiently and at
scale would require vast amounts of green electricity. Their energy
density is much lower than existing fuels, which means we need a lot
more fuel to produce power. Clearly, we need a different approach.

A solution exists that will enable the maritime sector to improve
efficiency and lower costs. It will also allow port and ship operators
to provide wider benefits to society. That solution is nuclear energy.

[The Nuclear Option]{.underline}

To understand the potential of nuclear energy, it's essential to grasp
how it works. It uses the process of nuclear fission -- splitting the
atom. When the nucleus of an atom is split into smaller nuclei, this
releases an immense amount of energy in the form of heat. This heat is
used to produce steam or hot gas, which drives turbines connected to
generators that produce electricity.

**[Nuclear energy can create vast amounts of electricity. It is vas[tly
more energy-dense than fossil fuels,]{.mark} and decades of operational
experience show that it is a good alternative.]{.underline}**

But nuclear energy has also faced headwinds throughout its history.
Traditional nuclear reactors use solid uranium fuel and need pressurized
water for coolant. This requires complex safety and containment
shelters, which have pushed up costs and construction times.

To roll out nuclear on a large scale, we need a new approach. New
concepts and technologies are being developed that will help unlock
nuclear energy\'s full potential.

Make it Modular

One such concept is that of small modular reactors (\"SMRs\").
Traditionally, nuclear power plants have been built as large, oneoff
installations at the gigawatt scale, with little standardization of
construction techniques or components. By contrast, SMRs are smaller,
with generation capacities of less than 300MW, and mass assembled on a
production line. Building each component in this modular makes them
cheaper and quicker to build. The small size of SMRs means they can be
easily shipped to where they are needed.

Additionally, advanced nuclear technologies can improve safety and
efficiency while further reducing costs. Designs for next-generation
reactors will use new types of fuel -- for example, using a molten salt
to carry the uranium rather than solid fuel pellets. This offers
improved safety as the reactors operate at lower pressures, reducing the
risk of failure while reducing costs, as expensive containment and
safety systems are not as important. Significantly, advanced nuclear
technologies use uranium much more efficiently than traditional
reactors, enabling them to run for many years -- even decades -- without
refueling.

Putting these pieces together, it\'s easy to see how they can benefit
ports and the wider maritime industry, and vice versa.

Shipyards have been using modular construction techniques for decades.
Building advanced SMRs in shipyards will make use of existing skilled
workforces to deliver energy projects on time and on budget.
Additionally, maritime manufacturing will enable nuclear energy projects
to be produced as two key applications: floating nuclear power plants
(\"FNPPs\") and marine civil nuclear propulsion (\"MCNP\").

[Energy Afloat]{.underline}

From a port operations point of view, FNPPs are likely the most
attractive of these two options. As their name suggests,
[FNPPs]{.underline} are power plants that employ SMRs securely installed
in floating barges. They will be mass produced in shipyards and then
towed to locations around the globe. FNPPs can then provide electricity
to local grids and provide power for port services. They [can even be
used off-grid for purposes such as desalination, decarbonizing upstream
oil and gas operations, or powering AI data centers]{.underline}. It's
been done in the U.S. before.

The first FNPP, the Sturgis, was deployed in the Panama Canal in 1968.
Floating fossil fuel power barges are already in operation worldwide and
thus are a proven concept. FNPPs will provide clean, reliable
electricity to where it is needed in the same way. Smaller, nearshore
barges can be berthed at ports, while larger capacity plants will be
moored further offshore. In both cases, **[[FNPPs can be quickly
installed and easily towed back to]{.mark} central [servicing yards for
refueling]{.mark} or decommissioning. This 'plug and play' flexibility
means FNPPs can [easily respond to changes in energy
demand]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[With these factors in mind, it's easy to see why FNPPs in various
configurations present an attractive opportunity to port operators. They
will provide electricity to power quayside services and could easily be
used to supply surplus power to the local electricity grid --
potentially creating extra revenue -- at times when harbor-based demand
is low.]{.underline}**

**[This means using nuclear to power ports [will only increase]{.mark}
the [economic benefits]{.mark} that the maritime sector already
provides, [such as boosting]{.mark} economic [development]{.mark},
[providing]{.mark} strong [infrastructure]{.mark} [and]{.mark} offering
long-term [employment opportunities]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[Moreover, FNPPs will [solve]{.mark} the problem of [rising demand for
electricity]{.mark} for port operations]{.underline}**. With the San
Pedro Bay ports (Los Angeles and Long Beach) needing 585 MW of
generation capacity by 2050, according to Pacific Merchant Shipping
Association estimates, it's clear that FNPPs will be well placed to
cater for this burgeoning need.

The engineering and regulatory hurdles involved in building FNPPs are
lower than those for MCNP ships and therefore FNPPs will be built first.
The use of nuclear propulsion in ships isn't new -- its origins stretch
back 70 years. The United States launched the world's first
nuclear-powered submarine in 1954, and nuclear propulsion was more
widely adopted in various military vessels, including surface ships,
over the following decades.

Atomic Advantage

The advantages of nuclear-powered ships are obvious. They can operate
for years without refueling, and travel at faster speeds than
conventional vessels. Also, the space needed for nuclear fuel is tiny in
comparison with the space needed for fossil fuels, freeing up more room
for cargo.

These massive potential benefits mean MCNP could revolutionize not only
the shipping sector, but also the entire world. Eighty percent of global
trade is carried by sea, meaning that swifter and efficient
nuclear-powered merchant ships will transform the world economy.

Given these enormous advantages, how come the civil shipping sector
hasn\'t taken up nuclear propulsion on a large scale? The answer is
because the global nuclear regulatory environment is not set up to
govern the operation of civil nuclear-powered vessels.

So, bringing [FNPPs and MCNP to market demands much more than simply
creating the technology. It requires a holistic solution that will need
to create the regulatory operating environment and physical
infrastructure necessary for both solutions to work]{.underline} -- from
creating the global consensus on regulation and insurance, to building
the supply chain and training the workforce, to ensuring robust
procedures for servicing and decommissioning.

Navigating the Challenges

CORE POWER is building a Maritime Civil Nuclear Program -- the first of
its kind within the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development (\"OECD\"). It is funded by substantial investments from
strategic customers in shipping, industrial energy, finance and private
equity.

We also a founding member of the Nuclear Energy Maritime Organization
(\"NEMO\"). NEMO is an international industry association working to
assist governments and intergovernmental agencies in developing
harmonized regulations for maritime nuclear applications. With over 30
organizations contributing expertise -- from classification societies
and insurers to reactor manufacturers and shipyards -- NEMO is laying
the foundation for integrating nuclear technology into the marine
sector.

Meanwhile, CORE POWER, along with key partners, is developing the
technology needed for FNPPs and MCNP. Using advanced nuclear
technologies for FNPPs and maritime propulsion will solve the problems
of insurability and conforming to regulatory requirements.

**[Once these regulations are in place, port operators will be in a
prime position to benefit from the nuclear revolution. The expertise
they gain in operating FNPPs can then be used to facilitate the
operation of nuclear-powered vessels -- ensuring a competitive advantage
over non-nuclear operators.]{.underline}**

**[Voyage Into the Future]{.underline}**

**[The maritime sector certainly has critical challenges to face over
the coming years. But [nuclear energy]{.mark}'s potential to create
economic growth means it [is a game-changing solution]{.mark}. The
unparalleled efficiency, low cost and adaptability of advanced nuclear
technologies [hold the key to a sustainable maritime future]{.mark}.
These technologies will enable the sector to improve economics and
efficiency while complying with ever stricter emissions
regulations.]{.underline}**

**[By championing innovations such as advanced SMRs and FNPPs, and
partnering with companies such as CORE POWER, port operators can lead
the way in embracing clean, reliable, and scalable energy
solutions.]{.underline}**

**[Why nuclear is the ideal solution:]{.underline}**

**[[Zero emissions]{.mark}: nuclear power produces no harmful emissions,
making them ideal for meeting stringent environmental
regulations.]{.underline}**

**[[Unmatched efficiency]{.mark}: a single nuclear fuel load can power
advanced reactors for years or even decades, eliminating the need for
frequent refueling and reducing operational costs.]{.underline}**

**[[Energy independence]{.mark}: unlike fossil fuels, nuclear [power is
less affected by price volatility and geopolitical tensions, ensuring
stable operating costs.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

As we navigate the seas of change, harnessing maritime nuclear power
will help us chart a course toward a more prosperous world.

**[[Increasing nuclear energy]{.mark} output not only [provides]{.mark}
energy [security]{.mark} for domestic concerns but is imperative to stay
on par with our adversaries. Two competing powers, the U.S. and China,
are alike in a few ways. One of these ways is both countries' need to
keep up with energy demand with growing populations. Both countries seek
to bolster their economies through domestically produced energy and
decrease their reliance on other countries to provide power and expend
energy for a variety of uses. China has figured out that [investment
into]{.mark} increasing its [nuclear power]{.mark} output [would be
beneficial to solve]{.mark} domestic [energy concerns and reduce]{.mark}
the [pollution]{.mark} problem it plagued itself with over decades of
fossil fuel consumption]{.underline}**. While the same motivations exist
for China to expand its nuclear energy production as the U.S., China has
begun this process to increase the number of nuclear reactors and
construct the required infrastructure to handle the increase in power
output from nuclear sources, while the U.S. has not. **[[The
U.S]{.mark}. does not want to be in a place where China has created the
energy security it [needs]{.mark} to supply its domestic energy needs
mostly through the use of [nuclear reactors]{.mark}, leaving its other
energy sources such as fossil fuels for other energy expenditures. Such
expenditures could be for manufacturing, where it could continue to
surpass the U.S. in that respect, or even for defense, such as improving
logistical support and enabling continued operation of assets requiring
petroleum-based fuel. The U.S. [would find it in]{.mark} its [best
interest to match China]{.mark} and bolster the nuclear power
industry]{.underline}** to achieve the same goals as, if not surpass
China.

**[Overall, the U.S. would find it in its best interest to increase its
nuclear power output for domestic use. Nuclear power]{.underline}** is
not and should not be used to replace fossil fuels completely. Rather,
it should supplement fossil fuels and ease the burden of fossil fuel
demand by providing an efficient alternative capable of meeting domestic
energy demands, thus **[allowing the U.S.'s fossil fuel industry to
provide domestic alternatives to foreign imports. The [economy and
energy industries would benefit]{.mark}, and the U.S. would improve its
energy security, [becoming more protected and less vulnerable]{.mark} to
supply chain disruptions from external sources]{.underline}**. The
increase in nuclear power production would also help keep pace with
China, providing the U.S. with the same strategic energy goals and
ensuring China takes no advantage over the U.S. in the realm of energy
security. Although the future of energy is not always clear, the
**[prospect of [nuclear energy as]{.mark} a national security interest
and efficient domestic [alternative to fossil fuels is

https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/exaggerated-threat-oil-wars,
igogi + wjiang

**[Between 1912 and 2010, [countries fought 180 times over territories
that contained]{.mark}---or were believed to contain---[oil]{.mark} or
natural gas resources. These conflicts ranged from brief, nonfatal
border violations, like Turkish jets entering Greek airspace, to the two
world wars. Many of these clashes---including World War II, Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait (1990), the U.S. invasion of Iraq (2003), the
Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), the Falklands War (1982), and the Chaco War
between Bolivia and Paraguay (1932-1935)---have been described as
classic oil wars: that is, severe international conflicts in which
countries fight to obtain petroleum resources.]{.underline}**

**[However, a closer look at these conflicts reveals [that none merits
the classic "oil war"]{.mark} label. Although countries did fight over
oil-endowed territories, [they]{.mark} usually [fought for other
reasons]{.mark}, [including]{.mark} aspirations to regional
[heg]{.mark}emony, [domestic]{.mark} [politics]{.mark}, national pride,
[or]{.mark} contested territories' other strategic, [econ]{.mark}omic,
or symbolic [assets]{.mark}. [Oil]{.mark} was an uncommon trigger for
international confrontations and [never caused major
conflicts]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[On approximately 20 occasions, over almost a century, countries
engaged in minor conflicts to obtain oil resources. However, these "[oil
spats" were brief, mild, mostly nonfatal]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and
generally involved countries whose hostility predated their resource
competition. Greece and Turkey have prosecuted oil spats. So have China
and Vietnam, Guyana and Venezuela, and a dozen other pairs of countries.
These confrontations inspired aggressive rhetoric while they were
underway, but none of them ever escalated into a larger armed conflict.

Oil has periodically influenced the trajectories of major conflicts that
were launched for other reasons. At the end of World War I, British
troops seized Mosul province in order to secure its oil resources. Oil
aspirations also motivated Germany's invasion of the Russian Caucasus
(1941-1942) and Japan's invasion of the Dutch East Indies (1941-1942).
While the latter attack precipitated U.S. involvement in World War II,
it was also a continuation of the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945).
All of these "oil campaigns" were inspired by aggressors' wartime
resource needs. Absent the ongoing conflicts, these countries would not
have fought for oil.

The historical record also reveals one "oil gambit": Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait in 1990. Conventional explanations for the attack assert that
Saddam Hussein was either greedily attempting to grab his neighbor's oil
resources or needily attempting to limit Kuwait's oil output in order to
raise oil prices and escape from a deepening economic crisis caused by
falling oil prices and Iraq's large debts, incurred during the Iran-Iraq
War. The first explanation is wrong. The second is correct, but
incomplete, because it omits Saddam's larger motive for aggression: his
fear of the United States. The regime's records, seized during the 2003
U.S. invasion, reveal Saddam's belief, nurtured since the 1970s, that
the United States was determined to contain Iraq and remove him from
power. In 1990, this false conviction led Saddam to assume that the
United States was engineering Iraq's economic crisis by encouraging
Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates to exceed their OPEC oil production
quotas and refuse Iraq's repeated entreaties to cancel its war debts.
After his infamous meeting with U.S. Ambassador April Glaspie failed to
persuade Saddam of the United States's benign intentions, he concluded
that conquering Kuwait was his only remaining means of survival. Fear of
U.S. hostility, not oil aspirations, prompted Iraq to invade Kuwait.

A Question of Value

The absence of oil wars is surprising and counterintuitive. Petroleum is
an exceptionally valuable resource. It fuels all countries' economies
and militaries. Oil sales are also a crucial revenue source for producer
states. Surely, countries are willing to fight to obtain petroleum
resources.

In fact, **[[classic oil wars are]{.mark} extraordinarily
[costly]{.mark}. A country that aims to seize foreign oil faces, first,
the costs of invading another country. International aggression is
destructive and expensive under the best of circumstances. It may also
damage the oil infrastructure that a conqueror hopes to acquire. Next,
if a conqueror plans to exploit oil resources over the long term, it
faces the costs of occupying seized territory. As the United States has
learned from its "endless wars," foreign occupation is extremely
challenging, even for the world's most powerful country.]{.underline}**

**[Additionally, [a conqueror faces international approbation]{.mark}
for oil grabs. As censorious responses to Trump's proposition that the
United States "take the oil" from Syria, Iraq and Libya have indicated,
seizing another country's oil is considered reprobate behavior. It
violates international laws against plunder and materially threatens to
consolidate control over global oil resources. As Iraq learned in 1990,
[other countries]{.mark} and international institutions [respond]{.mark}
to oil grabs [with]{.mark} diplomatic [censure]{.mark}, economic
[sanctions and]{.mark} even military [force]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Finally, if a conqueror manages to maintain control over foreign oil
resources, it may not be able to exploit them. Conquest scares off the
foreign oil companies that many countries rely on to finance and manage
oil production.

Because of the high costs of invasion, occupation, and international
opprobrium, [classic oil wars are]{.underline} simply [not worth the
effort]{.underline}, [regardless of petroleum's value]{.underline}.
Countries may occasionally decide that it is worth initiating an oil
spat to obtain desired resources, especially when targeted territories
are contested and other issues are at stake. However, fighting major
conflicts for oil does not pay.

### Impact Defense --- Energy Security --- 1AR

**Energy insecurity has [marginal effects]{.underline} on the economy**

**The** **Economist 22**, a globally respected, fact-based publication
founded in 1843, known for its editorial independence, anonymous
bylines, and trusted global coverage led by editor-in-chief Zanny Minton
Beddoes, who graduated from Oxford University a degree in Philosophy,
Politics, and Economics and a master's degree from Harvard University as
a Kennedy Scholar, The Economist, 3/12/22, "How oil shocks have become
less shocking,"
https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/03/12/how-oil-shocks-have-become-less-shocking,
igogi

Nevertheless, the easily observed **[relationship between oil and the
economy is no iron law. [There have been times]{.mark} [when]{.mark}
crude [prices soared and]{.mark} yet [recessions were averted]{.mark},
[including]{.mark} the peak of a global commodities boom in
[2011]{.mark}. The type of shock matters, as does the economic backdrop.
Moreover, much of [the world appears]{.mark} to have become better
[insulated from oil markets]{.mark} over time. Old dismal patterns may
not perfectly repeat]{.underline}** themselves.

Consider the mechanics by which rising oil prices hurt growth. Energy is
an important factor of production, so a sharp decrease in its supply or
increase in its price may drag down output. It may also hurt demand: if
people spend more of their incomes on oil, less is left over for other
things. Add to this the possibility that central banks may tighten
monetary policy aggressively when higher oil prices push up inflation,
as the Federal Reserve did following the opec crisis of 1973 and the
Iranian revolution of 1979.

Yet no two oil shocks are the same. A critical variable is whether the
shock stems from the economy's supply side or demand side. If there is a
sudden shortfall in supply, as during an embargo, that functions as a
new tax on production and consumption. If, however, robust demand is the
cause, rising oil prices reflect economic vitality. Lutz Kilian, an
economist with the Fed's branch in Dallas, has shown that broad demand
strength can, for a time, outweigh the negative effects of higher oil
prices. A pure supply shock is, by contrast, more harmful. The period
since the pandemic struck has featured a bit of both. The quadrupling in
crude prices from the spring of 2020 to the start of 2022 reflected
growth roaring back from its pandemic-induced slowdown. Only the most
recent surge is unquestionably a supply shock, caused by the Ukraine war
and associated sanctions.

Three changes in the structure of the global economy may dampen the
effects of the price surge. Most obviously **[[oil's role in
growth]{.mark} cycles [is not what it used to be]{.mark}. [In 1973 the
world used]{.mark} nearly [one barrel]{.mark} of oil [to produce
\$1,000-]{.mark}worth of [gdp]{.mark} (in inflation-adjusted terms). [By
2019 that was down to 0.43]{.mark} barrels, with the energy intensity of
growth falling annually "in an almost perfectly linear fashion",
according to a report last year by the Centre on Global Energy Policy at
Columbia University. A shift in economic output from industry to
services is part of the explanation. [The world has also become more
efficient]{.mark}]{.underline}** in using oil. Cars, for instance, go
twice as far per gallon of petrol as in the 1970s.

**[A related change is the way that governments respond to oil shocks.
As James Hamilton of the University of California, San Diego, has
observed, [in the]{.mark} 19[70s]{.mark} American [officials aggravated
economic dislocations]{.mark} with price controls on petrol, which
resulted in shortages. [Since 1981 they have steered]{.mark} clear of
such controls, which has made for more volatile crude prices but
[smoother market adjustments]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Some tweaks in
behaviour have got easier thanks to the pandemic: if air fares soar, why
fly to that business meeting when you can log on to Zoom instead?

**[Central bankers may also be less tempted to jack up interest rates
simply because of soaring energy prices, thereby reducing the risks of a
recession. There is a debate over whether the pass-through from oil
shocks to core inflation is basically nil, as argued in a paper for the
Fed by Todd Clark and Stephen Terry, or small, as argued in another Fed
paper by Cristina Conflitti and Matteo Luciani. However, the experts
agree [that the pass-through has weakened]{.mark}, in part
[because]{.mark} of the [diminished energy]{.mark} [intensity]{.mark} of
growth. Even before the war in Ukraine, the Fed was set to raise
interest rates several times this year in order to rein in inflation.
The salient point is that, according to market pricing, investors do not
believe that the oil shock will lead to much more aggressive moves by
the Fed]{.underline}** than previously expected.

CHINA AND the United States each have a growing and seemingly insatiable
demand for energy; they also increasingly depend on foreign supplies to
satisfy that demand. While most countries are anxious about
interruptions to their energy supplies, [great powers]{.underline} like
China and the US do more than worry --- they [seek]{.underline},
proactively and often [aggressively]{.underline}, to do whatever it
takes to ensure \"[energy security]{.underline}.\" Are these two
energy-hungry giants destined to clash over that pursuit?

Not necessarily. In fact, the notion that a country can achieve **[[true
energy security is a myth]{.mark}. The effort global leaders devote to
[securing energy]{.mark} supplies [indicates]{.mark} a fundamental
[misunderstanding of the]{.mark} international [energy market.]{.mark}
The real threat to international political stability posed by energy
does not come from the scarcity of oil or vulnerabilities to its supply
chain. Rather, [the threat comes from \"the cult of energy
insecurity]{.mark}\" --- [the erroneous belief that national]{.mark}
[security requires]{.mark} ambitious and vigilant foreign policy
[measures to assure]{.mark} adequate [access to
energy.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[The [cult of energy insecurity]{.mark} results from two great and
commonly held misconceptions. The first is to [overstate the
extent]{.mark} to [which the supply of oil]{.mark} to any given state
[can actually be threatened]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The second is to
greatly overestimate the extent to which states can redress problems of
energy security through foreign policy measures. Most foreign policy
measures designed to enhance energy security only marginally enhance it
at best, and invariably generate costs and negative international
political consequences that outweigh the benefits of any marginal
increase in security produced.

### Impact Defense --- Oil Shocks --- 2AC

#### Oil disruptions have zero global impact --- empirics

Dr. Eugene **Gholz 18**, Professor of Political Science at the
University of Notre Dame, PhD in Political Science from MIT, "Primacy
and Proliferation: Why Security Commitments Don't Prevent The Spread of
Nuclear Weapons", in US Grand Strategy in the 21st Century: The Case For
Restraint, Ed. Thrall and Friedman, p. 62-63

Left to their own devices, **[[buyers and sellers]{.mark} of oil have
strong incentives to [adapt to]{.mark} oil [shocks, bringing new
oil]{.mark} into the market [to compensate for]{.mark} oil taken out by
[disruptions. This]{.mark} compensation [mitigates]{.mark} economic
[damage]{.mark} and undermines the argument that military effort, as
part of a grand strategy of deep engagement, is required to prevent
unbearable economic harm.]{.underline}**

**[Political-military disruptions that reduce oil production or inhibit
the transit of oil through key chokepoints do not directly translate
into reduced oil access for consumers in a global market: non-disrupted
producers or other activities by consumers can add oil to the market to
replace barrels lost in the disruption. [The market]{.mark} itself
[is]{.mark} like "one great pool" or [a "global bathtub"]{.mark} into
which suppliers pump oil and from which consumers drain oil;
economically, the market mixes different sources of oil together,
[allowing]{.mark} various [producers to
substitute]{.mark}]{.underline}** for each other in sending oil to a
particular consumer and making specific producer--consumer relationships
essentially irrelevant (Griffin 2015). In a competitive market, an
unexpected contraction in the amount supplied by one producer puts
upward pressure on price, signaling other producers to increase their
output, thereby restoring the pre-disruption equilibrium. This logic
applies to OPEC members in times when the cartel's political control is
weak, and it always applies to non-OPEC oil producers, although their
capacity to respond rapidly to disruptions with large output increases
is generally limited.

In a market dominated by fewer suppliers (e.g., at times when the OPEC
cartel is relatively cohesive), non-disrupted producers do not require
the price signal to notice an opportunity to increase their output: they
can watch specific other members of the oligopoly and respond directly
to their changing output levels. They see another member's
under-production as an opportunity to increase their own output without
over-supplying the entire market and disturbing the established
oligopoly price. In studying oligopoly, economists describe the effect
of reduced production by one supplier on the amount of output offered by
other producers as the "reaction function." That function intercedes
between the disruption and the effect of the price elasticity of demand:
[as long as other]{.underline} oil [supply compensates for]{.underline}
the [disruption, the price]{.underline} of oil [will **not
rise**]{.underline}, and even price-inelastic consumers will not have to
suffer the cost of a price spike.

Separately from the incentive for non-disrupted suppliers to replace the
"missing barrels" that drop out of the market in a political-military
shock, **[[a shock]{.mark} may also [undermine cartel cohesion, leading
to more]{.mark} replacement [barrels]{.mark} being [offered]{.mark} over
time [than]{.mark} the [disruption removed]{.mark} from the
market]{.underline}**. Some shocks to the oil market result from
conflict among oil suppliers themselves, and open warfare, proxy
warfare, or "cold war" conditions within the potential cartel surely
complicate the bargaining that is necessary for the cartel to decide on
its preferred total oil production and to allocate quotas within the
cartel, driving the equilibrium back towards the competitive market
level based on greater total supply. But even in disruptions that do not
politically split the oligopoly of leading oil producers, every
non-disrupted producer would like to be the one that takes the
opportunity to make up for the disrupted output -- that is, each
producer has an incentive to increase its production, and temporary
quota modifications will have to be allocated (and followed) within the
cartel, creating an opportunity for cartel bargaining to break down.
**[[Instability]{.mark} can have the direct effect of removing some oil
production from the market, but at the same time it can also
[create]{.mark} conditions for [more production
overall]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[In addition to the supply-side reaction to shocks, consumers can take
advantage of [a substantial cushion on]{.mark} the [demand side]{.mark}
to [respond]{.mark} to supply disruptions (Gholz and Press 2008).
[Private]{.mark}ly held [inventories]{.mark} routinely [absorb
variations]{.mark} in oil supply of hundreds of thousands of barrels a
day of production. They give the market, including non-disrupted
producers, time to adjust, and since the total quantity of oil available
to consumers will not drop, the rigidity implied by well-known
price-elasticity estimates -- those that suggest that even small supply
disruptions might cause large price changes -- need not kick
in.]{.underline}**

**[Beyond the private stocks, [government]{.mark}-owned [strategic
reserves]{.mark} provide an additional resource. For years the world's
major consumers have bought extra oil to fill their emergency petroleum
reserves -- hundreds of millions of barrels that [could compensate for
any]{.mark} plausibly sized supply [disruption, barrel-for-barrel, for
months]{.mark} at a time]{.underline}**. Even though the International
Energy Agency agreement specifies that member countries should set the
size of their oil stocks based on their total oil imports, in actual
practice the reserves only need to supply enough to make up for the
missing barrels, a much easier task. The biggest disruptions in history
have taken several million barrels of oil per day off the market, and
draws from consumer-country strategic supplies can readily match that
rate. **[The most terrible scare scenario discussed in strategy debates,
complete closure of the Strait of Hormuz to tanker traffic, would bottle
up some 17 million barrels per day, if there were (implausibly) no shift
at all to alternative transportation routes and no compensation from oil
producers outside the Strait. In that very worst case and accounting for
the limits on the rates at which consumer governments can pump oil from
their strategic reserves, the government stockpiles in the United
States, other IEA countries, and non-IEA consumers like China could make
up a significant fraction of the disruption for months]{.underline}** --
though not enough to prevent a real price spike.

Whereas **[the world's reserve supply once sat in relatively
inaccessible pools, much of it now sits in easily accessible salt
caverns and storage tanks where consumers control the spigots. [Even
if]{.mark} consumer [governments manage]{.mark} their reserves
[imperfectly]{.mark}, not releasing at the economically optimal time,
the [combination of]{.mark} producers' [excess capacity, private
inventories, and strategic stocks significantly reduces the need for
activist]{.mark} energy security [policies]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Moreover, politicians' real-world hesitancy to tap strategic stockpiles
actually serves to protect the oil market: if governments were too
aggressive about managing price variation, they would suppress private
investors' efforts, limiting the energy security value of the private
inventories. But even politicians will take action in the largest,
clearest disruption scenarios (e.g., civil unrest in Saudi Arabia) --
precisely the scenarios in which the government stockpiles are needed to
backstop the normal market response.

**The US is resilient to supply shocks---tech advances and SPR**

Money, reporter for NPR. \"Why oil shocks are getting less shocking: The
Indicator from Planet Money\". 10-12-2022.

//wjiang

MA: Economic disruptions like this in the 1970s led to stagflation,
stagnant economic growth plus double-digit inflation - terrible
combination, obviously. **[And [today,]{.mark} we do have high oil
prices and also inflation. But in contrast to the \'70s, economists say
[the U.S]{.mark}. today [is much better able to withstand oil
shocks]{.mark}. And there are several reasons for that.]{.underline}**

**[WONG: One big reason is that the U.S. [economy has shifted much more
toward services]{.mark}, which are [less]{.mark} [energy
intensive]{.mark} than, say, manufacturing. And [industries that rely on
fossil fuels are getting more efficient.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[HAMILTON: [There have been]{.mark} significant [tech]{.mark}nological
[advances.]{.mark} For example, every year the internal [combustion
engine gets more efficient]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

MA: Of course, the internal combustion engine still burns fossil fuels,
which is part of the reason we are in a climate crisis right now. But
James says he thinks **[[consumer]{.mark} [preferences are making
a]{.mark} long-term [shift]{.mark} [towards]{.mark} smaller and more
[fuel-efficient cars]{.mark}, including electric vehicles. And the car
industry is responding.]{.underline}**

**[WONG: [Another factor]{.mark} making the U.S. economy more resilient
[is]{.mark} increased [energy independence]{.mark}. So the country
didn\'t have an oil reserve at the time of the Arab oil embargo in 1973.
It was only in 1975 in response to that shock that the government set up
the [Strategic Petroleum Reserve]{.mark}. It\'s this stockpile of
emergency oil in underground caverns on the Gulf Coast.]{.underline}**

MA: But this reserve is - it\'s finite, to say the least. At current
levels, it would not even be enough to cover one month\'s worth of
American oil consumption. But **[the reserve still [has come in
handy]{.mark}. The Biden administration has been steadily tapping into
it since the war in Ukraine, which has [help]{.mark}ed [bring down gas
prices.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[**WONG: On top of that, [the U.S. became a net energy exporter]{.mark}
in 2019. [This makes it less vulnerable to supply
shocks]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Contrast that with a lot of European
countries that rely on Russia for natural gas and are right now racing
to stockpile fuel for the winter.

### Impact Thumper --- Global Economy --- 2AC

**Trump thumps --- his economic policies will collapse the global
economy**

**Wiseman 25** -- Paul Wiseman; Paul Wiseman is a journalist with The
Associated Press. He covers trade and international economics.
(04-09-2025, "Trump disrupts global economic order even though the US is
dominant," The Associated Press,
https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-trade-markets-china-recession-economy-e532f95f05cf929b7bf27ea636627937,
SS)

**[[By declaring a trade war on the rest of the
world,]{.underline}]{.mark}** President Donald **[[Trump]{.mark} has
[panicked global]{.mark} financial [markets]{.mark}, [raised]{.mark} the
[risk of]{.mark} a [recession and broke]{.mark}n the political and
[economic alliances]{.mark} that made much of the world stable for
business after World War II.]{.underline}**

Trump's latest round of tariffs went into full effect at midnight
Wednesday, with higher import tax rates on dozens of countries and
territories taking hold.

Economists are puzzled to see Trump trying to overhaul the existing
economic order and doing it so soon after inheriting the strongest
economy in the world. Many of the trading partners he accuses of ripping
off U.S. businesses and workers were already floundering.

"There is a deep irony in Trump claiming unfair treatment of the
American economy at a time when it was growing robustly while every
other major economy had stalled or was losing growth momentum," said
Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University. "In an
even greater irony, **[the [Trump tariffs]{.mark} are [likely to]{.mark}
end [America's]{.mark} remarkable run of success and [crash the
economy]{.mark}, job growth [and]{.mark} financial
[markets]{.mark}.'']{.underline}**

[Trump]{.underline} and his trade advisers insist that the rules
governing global commerce [put the United States at a distinct
disadvantage.]{.underline} But mainstream economists --- whose views
Trump and his advisers disdain --- say the president has a warped idea
of world trade, especially a preoccupation with trade deficits, which
they say do nothing to impede growth.

The administration accuses other countries of erecting unfair trade
barriers to keep out American exports and using underhanded tactics to
promote their own. In Trump's telling, his tariffs are a long-overdue
reckoning: The U.S. is the victim of an economic mugging by Europe,
China, Mexico, Japan and even Canada.

It's true that some countries charge higher taxes on imports than the
United States does. Some manipulate their currencies lower to ensure
that their goods are price-competitive in international markets. Some
governments lavish their industries with subsidies to give them an edge.

However, the United States is still the second-largest exporter in the
world, after China. The U.S. exported \$3.1 trillion of goods and
services in 2023, far ahead of third-place Germany at \$2 trillion.

**[The [fear that Trump's remedies are deadlier]{.mark} than the
maladies he's trying to cure has [sent]{.mark} [investors
fleeing]{.mark} American [stocks]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Since Trump
announced sweeping import taxes on April 2, the S&P 500 has cratered
12%.

### Impact Thumper --- Global Economy --- 1AR

**Global economy collapse is inevitable under Trump**

**Monbiot 25 --** George Monbiot; English journalist, author, and
environmental and political activist. He writes a regular column for The
Guardian and has written several books. (02-18-2025, "There are many
ways Trump could trigger a global collapse. Here's how to survive if
that happens," The Guardian,
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/18/donald-trump-global-collapse-wildfires-pandemic-financial-crisis>,
SS)

Though we might find it hard to imagine, we cannot now rule it out: the
[possibility]{.underline} [of systemic collapse in the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. The **[[degradation of federal
government by]{.mark} Donald [Trump]{.mark} and Elon Musk [could
trigger]{.mark} a series of converging and compounding [crises, leading
to]{.mark} social, [financial]{.mark} and industrial
[failure]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[There are [several]{.mark} possible [mechanisms]{.mark}. Let's start
with an obvious one: their assault on financial regulation. Trump's
appointee to the [US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]{.mark}
(CFPB), Russell Vought, has [suspended]{.mark} all the [agency's
activity]{.mark}, slashed its budget and could be pursuing Musk's
ambition to "delete" the bureau. The CFPB was established by Congress
after the 2008 financial crisis, to protect people from the predatory
activity that helped trigger the crash. The signal to the financial
sector could not be clearer: "Fill your boots, boys." [A financial
crisis]{.mark} in the US [would]{.mark} immediately [become a global
crisis]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

But the hazards extend much further. Musk, calling for a "wholesale
removal of regulations", sends his child soldiers to attack government
departments stabilising the entire US system. Regulations, though
endlessly maligned by corporate and oligarchic propaganda, are all that
protect us from multiple disasters. In its initial impacts, deregulation
is class war, hitting the poorest and the middle classes at the behest
of the rich. As the effects proliferate, it becomes an assault on
everyone's wellbeing.

To give a couple of examples, the fires in Los Angeles this year are
expected to cost, on various estimates, between \$28bn and \$75bn in
insured losses alone. Estimates of total losses range from \$160bn to
\$275bn. These immense costs are likely to be dwarfed by future climate
disasters. As [Trump rips down environmental protections and trashes
federal responsiveness, the impacts will spiral]{.underline}. They could
include non-linear shocks to either the insurance sector or homeowners,
[escalati]{.underline}ng [into US-wide economic and social
crisis.]{.underline}

If (or when) another pandemic strikes, which could involve a pathogen
more transmissible and even more deadly than Covid-19 (which has so far
killed 1.2 million people in the US), it will hit a nation whose
defences have been stood down. Basic public health measures, such as
vaccination and quarantine, might be inaccessible to most. A pandemic in
these circumstances could end millions of lives and cause spontaneous
economic shutdown.

Because there is little public understanding of how complex systems
operate, collapse tends to take almost everyone by surprise. Complex
systems (such as economies and human societies) have characteristics
that make them either resilient or fragile. A system that loses its
diversity, redundancy, modularity (the degree of compartmentalisation),
its "circuit breakers" (such as government regulations) and backup
strategies (alternative means of achieving a goal) is less resilient
than one which retains these features. So is a system whose processes
become synchronised. **[[In]{.mark} a [fragile system,]{.mark}
[shocks]{.mark} can [amplify]{.mark} more [rapidly and]{.mark}
[become]{.mark} more [transmissible]{.mark}: a [disruption in one place
proliferates into disaster everywhere]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This, as
Andy Haldane, former chief economist at the Bank of England, has deftly
explained, is what happened to the financial system in 2008.

A consistent feature of globalised capitalism is an unintentional
assault on systemic resilience. As corporations pursue similar
profit-making strategies, and financialisation and digitisation permeate
every enterprise, the economic system loses its diversity and starts to
synchronise. As they consolidate, and the biggest conglomerates become
hubs to which many other enterprises are connected (think of Amazon or
the food and farming giant Cargill), major failures could cascade at
astonishing speed.

As every enterprise seeks efficiencies, the system loses its redundancy.
As trading rules and physical infrastructure are standardised (think of
those identical container terminals, shipping and trucking networks),
the system loses both modularity and backup strategies. When a system
has lost its resilience, **[[a small external shock can trigger
cascading collapse.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**Ukraine, Trump's threats, and tariffs all mean global economy
collapse**

SS)

For the past eight decades, the [US has supplied]{.underline} [essential
international public goods]{.underline}, not by altruism, but by
enlightened self-interest. The post-Cold War world was further defined
by the triumph of democracy, the expansion of globalisation, and the
consolidation of a rules-based international order anchored in
multilateral institutions, open markets, and US leadership.

While the second Trump administration did not originate fractures in
this system, it is accelerating and deepening them, including with
policies that amount to attacks on the global multilateral order itself.

For instance, the **[[US's]{.mark} stark unilateral [tariffs]{.mark}
[undermine]{.mark} the principle of [non-discrimination]{.mark}, a
foundational norm of the WTO and once a pillar of US trade leadership,
[thereby undermining a core tenet of multilateralism and rules-based
global commerce.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[In stepping back from its traditional role in providing global public
goods, the [administration is undermining]{.mark} collective [capacity
to manage]{.mark} transnational [risks and leaving the global
commons]{.mark} increasingly [exposed]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[While this has unsettled most countries, it also is prompting
strategic recalibration across advanced economies, particularly in
Europe. The war in [Ukraine]{.mark}, coupled with President [Trump's
threats]{.mark} to withdraw from NATO [and]{.mark} impose sweeping
[tariffs]{.mark}, has [left Europe]{.mark} increasingly
[exposed]{.mark}, both [economically]{.mark} and
strategically.]{.underline}**

The EU, the world's second-largest economy, has internal weaknesses. As
Draghi (2024) and Letta (2024) have argued, Europe is operating below
potential with a substantial productivity gap. Europe's most effective
response is to complete its internal market. Lowering intra-EU barriers
will enhance economic performance and increase Europe's geopolitical
weight. Paradoxically, if Europe can find the political will, US
policies may provide the impetus needed to accelerate EU integration and
unlock long-delayed potential. President Trump's policies make European
strategic autonomy essential.

The [US's new policies]{.underline} [are forcing Europe to confront its
fragmented defence architecture as well]{.underline}. A credible
response will require increased common defence spending, faster
procurement cycles, and greater alignment with partners. If executed
well, such an effort also might catalyse a technological transformation,
particularly in strategic sectors like advanced digital infrastructure
and AI.

Elsewhere around the globe, China remains the primary interest of
President Trump's trade policies, and one of the few countries to
respond with substantial retaliatory tariffs. China is highly
competitive in many high-tech sectors and has real economic leverage, as
recently demonstrated by China's restrictions on exports of rare earth
minerals and magnets. It faces, however, **[mounting structural
stresses: high debt, surging youth unemployment, and a fragile real
estate sector. [Mitigating US tariff shocks would require China to
shift]{.mark} toward consumption-led growth.]{.underline}**

**[As daunting as US-Canada relations have been, they may have led to a
shift in Canada's political landscape: the Liberal Party gained greater
traction under its new leader, Mark Carney. In Japan, it may provide
impetus to enact long-overdue agricultural reforms.]{.underline}**

**[[Latin America]{.mark}, due to its geographic and economic proximity
to the US, is especially [exposed to Washington's]{.mark} [trade
agenda]{.mark}. Mexico is particularly vulnerable. As the top US trading
partner and a linchpin of the North American auto industry, it holds the
second-largest bilateral trade surplus with the US. Any
[tightening]{.mark} of trade [conditions]{.mark} is [likely to]{.mark}
[dampen Mexico's growth]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Beyond trade, [deep cuts to foreign aid threaten far-reaching
consequences in low-income economies]{.underline}. Proposed reductions
in assistance could result in more than 500,000 additional deaths each
year, primarily due to increased mortality from diseases like HIV and
malaria.

Concluding assessment

The overall economic picture painted by our assembled experts is
troubling. **[Disruption of the global economic system the US helped
build and lead may accelerate the world's transition toward a more
uncertain multipolar economic order. Collectively, [The]{.mark} Economic
[Consequences of]{.mark} the Second [Trump Administration]{.mark}: A
Preliminary Assessment [suggests]{.mark} that the [policies]{.mark} of
the new Administration are [likely to weigh negatively on]{.mark} both
[the]{.mark} US and [global economy in the short and long
term.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### Impact Defense --- Global Economy --- 2AC

**Global economic [decline]{.underline} doesn't cause
[war]{.underline}.**

**Walt '20** \[Stephen; May 13; Professor of International Relations at
Harvard University; Foreign Policy, \"Will a Global Depression Trigger
Another World War?\"
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/13/coronavirus-pandemic-depression-economy-world-war/>,
SS\]

On balance, however, **[[I do not think]{.mark} that even the
extraordinary [econ]{.mark}omic conditions we are witnessing today are
going to have much [impact]{.mark} on the likelihood of [war]{.mark}.
Why? First of all, [if depressions]{.mark} were a powerful
[cause]{.mark} of [war, there would be]{.mark} a lot [more]{.mark} of
the latter. To take one example, the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has
[suffered 40]{.mark} or more recessions since the country was founded,
[yet]{.mark} it has fought perhaps [20]{.mark} interstate [wars,
most]{.mark} of them [unrelated to]{.mark} the state of the
[econ]{.mark}omy. To paraphrase the economist Paul Samuelson's famous
quip about the stock market, if recessions were a powerful cause of war,
they would have predicted "nine out of the last five (or
fewer)."]{.underline}**

**[Second, states do not start wars unless they believe they will win a
quick and relatively cheap victory. As John Mearsheimer showed in his
classic book Conventional Deterrence, [national leaders avoid war
when]{.mark} they are convinced it will be long, bloody, costly, [and
uncertain]{.mark}]{.underline}**. To choose war, political leaders have
to convince themselves they can either win a quick, cheap, and decisive
victory or achieve some limited objective at low cost. Europe went to
war in 1914 with each side believing it would win a rapid and easy
victory, and Nazi Germany developed the strategy of blitzkrieg in order
to subdue its foes as quickly and cheaply as possible. Iraq attacked
Iran in 1980 because Saddam believed the Islamic Republic was in
disarray and would be easy to defeat, and George W. Bush invaded Iraq in
2003 convinced the war would be short, successful, and pay for itself.

**[The fact that each of these leaders miscalculated badly does not
alter the main point: [No matter]{.mark} what a country's economic
[condition]{.mark} might be, its [leaders will not]{.mark} go to [war
unless]{.mark} they think they can do so [quickly, cheaply, and
with]{.mark} a reasonable probability of
[success]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[Third, and most important, the primary [motivation for]{.mark} most
wars [is]{.mark} the desire for [security, not]{.mark} economic
[gain]{.mark}. For this reason, the odds of war increase when states
believe the long-term balance of power may be shifting against them,
when they are convinced that adversaries are unalterably hostile and
cannot be accommodated, and when they are confident they can reverse the
unfavorable trends and establish a secure position if they act now. The
historian A.J.P. Taylor once observed that ["every war]{.mark} between
Great Powers \[between 1848 and 1918\] ... [started as]{.mark} a
[preventive]{.mark} war, [not]{.mark} as a war of [conquest]{.mark},"
and that remains true of most wars fought since then]{.underline}**.

The bottom line: **[Economic conditions (i.e., a [depression]{.mark})
may affect the broader political environment in which decisions for war
or peace are made, but they [are]{.mark} only [one factor among
many]{.mark} and [rarely]{.mark} the most [significant]{.mark}. Even if
the COVID-19 pandemic has large, lasting, and negative effects on the
world [economy]{.mark}---as seems quite likely---it [is not likely to
affect]{.mark} the [probability]{.mark} of war very much]{.underline}**,
especially in the short term.

**Economic decline doesn't directly cause war**

**Lesser 25** -- Ian Lesser; Distinguished Fellow at the German Marshall
Fund of the United States (GMF) and leads GMF's Brussels office.
(04-25-2025, "From Economic Warfare to Global War?", GMF,
<https://www.gmfus.org/news/economic-warfare-global-war>, SS)

At key points over the last century, unbridled nationalism and economic
warfare have driven geopolitical competition, with disastrous
consequences. These destructive forces have been unleashed again with
scant regard to the lessons of history. The imposition of sweeping
tariffs on global trade partners is not just a source of financial risk.
At a time of heightened global disorder, it moves the world one big step
closer to large-scale conflict. For the United States, this could be a
conflict without the benefit of allies.

**[[The world has been here before]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In the decade
prior to World War I, **[[fear of relative economic decline drove
strategic perceptions in ways that contributed to
instability]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Europe, even---perhaps
especially---against a backdrop of high economic interdependence. Both
winners and losers of that enormously destructive conflict emerged
convinced that economic instruments had shaped the outcome, for better
or for worse. During the interwar years, virtually every major power,
including the United States, had a ministry of economic warfare aimed at
honing the capacity for sanctions, blockade, and export controls. US
protectionism spurred a trade war among former allies. Germany and Italy
aimed for economic self-sufficiency through industrial policy and
territorial expansion. The Soviet Union sought economic autarky on its
own terms. Japan, acutely aware of its dependence on foreign sources of
critical resources, sought to preempt its exposure through aggressive
expansion and the creation of a Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere.
In key respects, World War II was the product of a toxic brew of
nationalism, economic anxiety, and faith in the power of political will
to beat the strategic odds. Reflecting on this experience, three
developments are particularly worrisome.

First, the slide from crisis to war can be rapid. In 1914, the security
order in Europe collapsed within a period of weeks, driven in large
measure by a shared sense that caution would lead to disadvantage. This
was a product of preexisting mobilization plans but also reflected the
desire to transcend the damage from the severe disruption of global
trade and finance already evident by the summer of 1914. Existing
anxiety over economic competitiveness and financial exposure reinforced
the logic of war and hastened the slide toward conflict. Today, concerns
of this kind abound on both sides of the Atlantic and in Asia.

Second, declining economic interdependence and the disruption of global
value chains can be destabilizing in their own right. Nations may be
antagonistic, with competing interests and objectives, but there will
always be a cost-benefit calculus in relation to conflict and the use of
force. China and the United States may indeed be ardent competitors,
even adversaries, but the costs of economic disruption have always
influenced strategy in Beijing and Washington. **[The
[perception]{.mark} that one or both sides simply have nothing to lose
may [not lead]{.mark} directly [to]{.mark} deliberate
[conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline}** But it could have a profound effect on
behavior when things go wrong through provocation, brinksmanship, or an
accidental clash. The escalatory costs of economic decoupling, much less
active economic warfare, should not be underestimated.

Third, in the 1930s, tariff-fueled economic crises exacerbated social
strains and supported the rise of radical ideologies and the collapse of
the political center in Western Europe and Japan. Nationalism, identity
politics, and the drive for economic self-sufficiency were common
characteristics in the interwar strategic environment. In the United
States, these conditions supported the America First movement and a
sovereignty-conscious disdain for European entanglements. It took Pearl
Harbor and an internationalist president to wake the country from an
inward-looking isolationist slumber. **[[Economic
stress]{.underline}]{.mark}** and social dislocation
**[[encourage]{.mark}d a search for culprits and
[conspiracies]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and a general atmosphere of
xenophobia. In this respect, among others, 2025 begins to look
disturbingly like 1935.

[**[None of this is meant to suggest that an obsession with economic
warfare leads inevitably to conflict,]{.underline}** **[much less global
war]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}** But **[[the odds of
such]{.underline}]{.mark}** a progression, already significant, **[[have
shortened considerably]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And this could be a war
the United States fights alone. Allies, even those alienated by trade
frictions, might still be inclined to back Washington. But there is no
guarantee, and adversaries may be encouraged by the prospect that
European and Asian partners will stand aside or hedge. The lesson is
clear. Economic warfare can easily turn geopolitical competition into
large-scale conflict.

**The Great Recession disproves their impact**

System Worked: How the World Stopped Another Great Depression, eBook,

Finally, the Great [**[Recession did not lead]{.mark} to a
[deterioration]{.mark} in international security**.]{.underline} Because
political instabil¬ity and violence can impinge on cross-border flows,
in¬creases in international conflict can dampen cross-bor¬der trade and
exchange. During the initial stages of the crisis, multiple analysts
asserted that the Great Reces¬sion would lead states to increase the use
of political viol¬ence as a tool to stay in power.44They voiced genuine
concerns that the global economic downturn would lead to an increase in
conflict---whether through greater in¬ternal repression, diversionary
wars, arms races, or a ratcheting up of great-power rivalries. Violence
in the Middle East, piracy on the high seas, border disputes in the
South China Sea, riots in European cities, and even the disruptions of
the Occupy movement fueled impres-sions of a global surge in public
disorder. As fiscal aus¬terity in the developed economies curtailed
social spend¬ing, economists predicted an explosion of unrest.45
Initially, there was some evidence of deterioration. Following the 2008
financial crisis, there was a spike in global piracy, particularly off
the Horn of Africa. The In¬ternational Maritime Bureau reported that in
2009 alone, there was a 40 percent surge in piracy attacks, with attacks
near Somalia quadrupling during the same period. The Institute for
Economics and Peace, which has constructed the Global Peace Index
annually since 2007, reported in 2013 that there had been a 5 percent
deterioration in global peace since 2008.46 72/452 [A
close]{.underline}r look at the [numbers]{.underline}, however, [reveals
more encouraging findings.]{.underline} What seemed to be an inexorable
increase in piracy, for example, turned out to be a blip. By September
2013, the total numbers of [piracy]{.underline} attacks [had
fallen]{.underline} to their lowest levels in seven years. Attacks near
Somalia, in particular, declined substantially; the total number of
attacks fell by 70 percent in 2012 and an additional 86 percent in the
first nine months of 2013. Actual hijackings were down 43 percent
compared to 2008/9 levels.47 The US Navy\'s figures reveal similar
de¬clines in the number and success rate of pirate attacks.48
**[[Security]{.mark} concerns have [not dented]{.mark} the opening of
the global [econ]{.mark}omy. As for the effect of the Great Recession on
political [conflict]{.mark}, the aggregate [effects]{.mark} were
surprisingly [modest]{.mark}. A key conclusion of the [I]{.mark}nstitute
for [E]{.mark}conomics and [P]{.mark}eace in its 2012 [report]{.mark}
was that [\"the]{.mark} average level of [peace]{.mark}fulness [in 2012
is]{.mark} approximately [the same as]{.mark} it was in
20[07.\"]{.mark}49 The institute\'s concern in its 2013 report about a
decline in peace was grounded primarily in the increase in homicide
rates---a source of concern, to be sure, but not exactly the province of
global governance. Both interstate [violence and]{.mark} global
[military expenditures]{.mark} have [declined]{.mark} since the start of
the financial crisis. Other [studies confirm]{.mark} that the Great
[Recession has not triggered]{.mark} any increase in violent
[conflict]{.mark}. Looking at the post-crisis years, Lotta Themner and
Peter Wallensteen conclude, \"The [pattern is]{.mark} one of relative
[stability]{.mark} when we consider the trend for the past five
years.\"50 The de-cline in secular violence that started with the end of
the Cold War has not been reversed. Rogers Brubaker 73/452 observes that
\"the [crisis has not]{.mark} to date [generated]{.mark} the surge in
[protectionist nationalism]{.mark} or ethnic exclusion]{.underline}**
that might have been expected.\"51

SS)

By many measures, **[[2020 is]{.mark} looking to be [the worst
year]{.mark} that humankind has faced in many decades. We're in the
midst of a [pandemic]{.mark} that has already [claimed]{.mark} more than
280,000 [lives, sickened millions]{.mark} of people, and is certain to
afflict millions more before it ends. The world [economy is in free
fall, with unemployment rising]{.mark} dramatically, [trade]{.mark} and
[output plummeting]{.mark}, and no hopeful end in sight. A plague of
locusts is back for a second time in Africa, and last week we learned
about murderous killer wasps threatening the bee population in the
United States. Americans have a head-in-the-sand president who
prescribes potentially lethal nostrums and ignores the advice of his
scientific advisors. Even if all those things magically disappeared
tomorrow---and they won't---we still face the looming long-term danger
from climate change.]{.underline}**

[Given all that, what could possibly make things worse? Here's one
possibility: war.]{.underline} It is therefore worth asking whether the
combination of a pandemic and a major economic depression is making war
more or less likely. What does history and theory tell us about that
question?

For starters, we know neither plague nor depression make war impossible.
World War I ended just as the 1918-1919 influenza was beginning to
devastate the world, but that pandemic didn't stop the Russian Civil
War, the Russo-Polish War, or several other serious conflicts. The Great
Depression that began in 1929 didn't prevent Japan from invading
Manchuria in 1931, and it helped fuel the rise of fascism in the 1930s
and made World War II more likely. So if you think major war simply
can't happen during COVID-19 and the accompanying global recession,
think again.

**[But war could still be much less likely. The Massachusetts Institute
of Technology's Barry Posen has already considered the likely impact of
the current pandemic on the probability of war, and he believes
[COVID]{.mark}-19 is more likely to [promote peace]{.mark} instead. He
argues that the current [pandemic is affecting]{.mark} all the [major
powers adversely]{.mark}, which means [it isn't creating]{.mark}
tempting [windows of opportunity]{.mark} for unaffected states while
leaving others weaker and therefore vulnerable. Instead[, it is making
all gov]{.mark}ernments more [pessimistic]{.mark} about their short- to
medium-term prospects. Because states often go to war out of sense of
overconfidence (however misplaced it sometimes turns out to be),
[pandemic-induced pessimism should be conducive to
peace.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Moreover, by its very nature **[[war requires states to assemble]{.mark}
lots of people [in close proximity]{.mark}---at training camps, military
bases, mobilization areas, ships at sea, etc.---and [that's not
something you]{.mark} want to [do in]{.mark} the middle of [a
pandemic]{.mark}. For the moment at least, beleaguered governments of
all types are focusing on convincing their citizens they are doing
everything in their power to protect the public from the
disease.]{.underline}** Taken together, these considerations might
explain why even an impulsive and headstrong warmaker like Saudi
Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman has gotten more interested in winding down
his brutal and unsuccessful military campaign in Yemen.

Posen adds that **[[COVID]{.mark}-19 is also likely to [reduce]{.mark}
international [trade]{.mark} in the short to medium term. Those who
believe economic interdependence is a powerful barrier to war might be
alarmed by this development, but he points out that trade issues have
been a source of considerable friction in recent years---especially
between the United States and China---and a degree of
[decoupling]{.mark} might [reduce tensions]{.mark} somewhat and cause
the odds of war to recede]{.underline}**.

### Impact Defense --- Agriculture Scenario --- 2AC

**Food wars don't cause [extinction]{.underline}**\-\--other
[variables]{.underline} determine the cause of [conflict]{.underline},
and war [turns]{.underline} insecurity.

//xav!

A criticism of Food or war is that the titular argument that food has a
role in the genesis of conflict becomes muddled with the positive
feedback loop argument couched within the food--war nexus
**[[Cribb]{.mark} describes. The former seems to [neglect the role
of]{.mark} [conflict in causing food]{.mark} and hunger [crises]{.mark},
emphasizing [only a one-way relationship]{.mark} from food crisis to
war. This is not to say that Cribb does not present both pathways of
this nexus---he does and in compelling fashion---but rather that the
evidence supports a slightly different and more cyclical hypothesis than
the central thesis.]{.underline}**

**[Similarly, in emphasizing the inarguably important role of food in
relationship to conflict, [other variables critical for]{.mark}
[understanding]{.mark} the conflict cycle [are ignored]{.mark}. [Full
bellies do not premise utopia]{.mark} as Cribb seems to extrapolate from
his material. A [well-fed populace]{.mark} is [not one without
ideological, moral, or political differences]{.mark}---all of which have
been implicated in the conflict cycle. At times Cribb likens food stress
to "tinder" (e.g., pp. 140--141, 149), which would suggest, perhaps more
appropriately, that the state of the food system is a necessary but not
sufficient element of initiating conflict. While the argument posited is
never that food is the only cause, the [other contributors are
rarely]{.mark} if at all [mentioned]{.mark}]{.underline}**, leaving the
non-expert reader without a sense of what else contributes to this
complex issue.

Finally, while the main argument is persuasive (if at times muddled)
some statements would benefit from supporting evidence while others
would specifically be better supported by scientific evidence rather
than popular science journalism or news media. This is particularly true
of each instance in which the female gender is ascribed particular
personality traits in universal fashion in apparent disregard for
feminist critiques of stereotyping. Trying to anticipate this very
critique, Cribb states, "This isn't gender stereotyping. It's an
observation about how different kinds of humans think" (2018, p. 201),
which does not offer the credibility to his argument that he thinks it
does. From a science communication perspective, **[the mixing of
scientifically supported and [unsupported claims]{.mark} at times
[make]{.mark}s [it difficult]{.mark} to determine what is a tested and
true understanding and what is Cribb's personal
perspective.]{.underline}**

### Impact Defense --- Agriculture Scenario --- 1AR

#### No impact to food wars --- scholarly consensus

//xav!

It is perhaps surprising, then, that there is **[[little scholarly merit
in the notion that]{.mark} a short-term [reduction in access to
food]{.mark} [increases]{.mark} the [probability that conflict will
break out]{.mark}. This is because [to start]{.mark} or participate in
[violent conflict requires people to]{.mark} [have]{.mark} both the
[means and]{.mark} the [will]{.mark}. Most [people on]{.mark} the [brink
of starvation]{.mark} are [not in]{.mark} the [position to resort to
violence]{.mark}, whether against the government or other social groups.
In fact, the urban middle classes tend to be the most likely to protest
against rises in food prices, since they often have the best
opportunities, the most energy, and the best skills to coordinate and
participate in protests.]{.underline}**

**[Accordingly, there is a widespread misapprehension that social unrest
in periods of high food prices relates primarily to food shortages. In
reality, the [sources of discontent are]{.mark} considerably [more
complex]{.mark} -- [linked to]{.mark} political [structures]{.mark},
[land]{.mark} ownership, [corruption]{.mark}, the [desire for]{.mark}

price of food is seen in the context of general increases in the cost of
living. [Research has shown that while the]{.mark} international
[media]{.mark} have a [tend]{.mark}ency [to seek simple]{.mark}
[resource]{.mark}-related [explanations]{.mark} -- such as drought or
famine -- for conflicts in the Global South, [debates]{.mark} in the

Energy supply interruptions pose critical geopolitical challenges since
they yield significant social effects. The process of gas flaring paired
with methane leakages creates environmental changes that endanger energy

The process of gas flaring signifies the unrestricted combustion of
natural gas in oil operations that generates damaging pollutants that
vaporize into the air. During the oil and gas value chain, methane leaks
through pipelines, storage facilities, and other network points. Methane
operates as a potent greenhouse gas. The management of gas flares, along
with methane leaks, leads to crucial effects on both energy security and
geopolitical risks[. **[Energy diversification strategies]{.mark}** help
**[protect energy security]{.mark} [by eliminating fossil fuel

Maintaining energy balance serves two essential functions: it decreases
geopolitical risk and enhances energy security status. Adding renewable
energy resources such as wind and solar power to diverse energy systems
gives countries an effective method to decrease their dependence on
fossil fuels. Renewable energy systems need less material input during
operation, generate minimal environmental harm, and exhibit strong
resistance against geopolitical instability

fuel development and petrochemical pollution]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In
[a destructive cycle, the **[fossil-fuel-driven degradation of wild
places and loss of species worsens the climate
crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline} by disrupting ecosystem-based carbon
dioxide removal from the atmosphere, which is needed to curb global
heating \[290\]. Overall, [fossil-fuel-driven biodiversity loss has
direct and dire impacts on food security and nutrition, water quality
and availability, health and well-being, carbon storage and
sequestration, resilience to climate change,]{.underline} and almost all
of nature's vital contributions \[291\], on top of the incalculable,
[non-monetizable costs of species extinctions]{.underline}.

[Worldwide an estimated one million animal and plant species are
threatened with extinction]{.underline}, with [climate
change]{.underline} as a primary [driver, alongside habitat destruction
and exploitation]{.underline} \[292\]. Scientists have long documented
the widespread and growing stresses of anthropogenic climate change on
species and ecosystems, as rising temperatures, more extreme weather
events, coastal flooding, sea ice and glacier melt, and other climate
hazards make conditions more inhospitable. [Climate change is disrupting
species' distributions, timing of breeding and migration, physiology,
vital rates, and genetics]{.underline} \[293--296\]. It is spreading
disease and invasive species; [increasing mortality and localized
extinctions; and deteriorating ecosystem processes]{.underline}
\[297--299\]. Climate change-related local extinctions are already
widespread \[300\].

[**[Every increase in fossil fuel pollution]{.mark}** and resulting
climate stress pushes ecosystems **[closer to tipping points and
amplifies extinction risk]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [With ∼1.5°C
temperature rise as of 2024, the world's coral reef
ecosystems]{.underline}---[which support]{.underline} a quarter of ocean
life and the [livelihoods of a half billion people---are in
crisis]{.underline} due to increasingly frequent and severe bleaching
events from ocean heating paired with ocean acidification \[301\]. [Half
of the world's reefs have already been lost \[302\] and near total
global reef collapse is projected at 2°C temperature rise]{.underline}
\[66\]. An estimated [1.6% of species are projected to become extinct at
the current level of temperature rise]{.underline} \[303\]. Numerous
[studies]{.underline} have [project]{.underline}ed [catastrophic species
losses with continued fossil fuel pollution]{.underline} with, for
example, the [climate-related extinction of 14%--32% of animal and plant
species]{.underline}---representing the [potential loss of 3 million to
6 million species]{.underline}---[in]{.underline} the [next 50 years,
even under intermediate fossil fuel emissions scenarios]{.underline}
\[304\]. Scientists have called for the urgent transformation of our
energy system away from fossil fuels to prevent a mass extinction event
\[305\].

[**[Fossil fuel development]{.mark}** itself]{.underline} also [causes a
wide array of harms]{.underline} to species and ecosystems:
**[[destroying and fragmenting wildlife habitat, causing air, noise, and
light pollution, contaminating surface and ground water and reducing
water supplies]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and **[[facilitating the spread
of ecologically disruptive invasive species]{.underline}]{.mark}**
\[306--308\], with similar harms in the marine environment \[309\].
[Fossil fuel infrastructure creates]{.underline} the [significant
**[risk of oil spills]{.mark}** and brine spills,]{.underline} which can
[kill wildlife and cause long-term impacts over large areas]{.underline}

COP15 biodiversity talks [in Montreal.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[In the Amazon and Congo basins, an area six times the size of the UK
is threatened by expanding oil and gas extraction, with tens of millions
of people from indigenous and local communities at risk.]{.underline}**

Mapping and **[analysis in a report published at COP15 revealed that
[more than 135 million hectares]{.mark} [of undisturbed tropical
forest]{.mark} is [already]{.mark} in production or [under exploration
by the oil and gas]{.mark} [industries]{.mark}. More than 20 per cent of
the total population in these regions now live in blocks of land
designated for production and exploration by the fossil fuel
industry.]{.underline}**

Mangroves

**[Alicia Guzman, director of the Amazon program at campaign
organisation Stand.earth, explained that two thirds of oil and gas
exports from the Amazon rainforest go to the US. More than half the oil
produced in the Amazon is exported to California, she
added.]{.underline}**

[**She said at a press conference at COP15: "The [Amazon]{.mark} has
[reached]{.mark} [its tipping point,]{.mark} meaning that it cannot
regenerate itself. There are many drivers to deforestation in the
Amazon - we can talk about leather in Brazil, but in Colombia, Ecuador
and Peru, we\'re talking about oil**.]{.underline} It's legal because
it's driven by governments in oil and gas concessions."

"Ecuador is the tiniest country in South America - we have less than two
per cent of the Amazon and yet 52 per cent is an oil block - half of the
Amazon in Ecuador," she said. "In fact, we have the highest density of
oil blocks in all of the Amazon - 89 per cent of all the Amazonian oil
comes from my country."

**[Harrison Nnoko, executive president at AJESH Cameroon, said he had
visited affected sites in the Congo rainforest, and carried out
independent monitoring.]{.underline}**

**["The [situation for biodiversity is disastrous]{.mark}. [Oil and gas

This affected not just animals and plants, but also human health in an
area where people lack access to medical care.

Tar sands

In Canada **[extraction of oil from tar sands [in]{.mark} [Northern
Alberta]{.mark} has expanded to such an extent that the tailings ponds
-- bodies of sand and fluids holding the toxic waste from the extraction
process -- can be seen from space. The tailings store extremely toxic
chemicals]{.underline}**, including high concentrations of dangerous
naphthenic acids.

Since the first oil sands project in 1967, the increase in the number
and size of tailings has been momentous. As of 2020, there are 30 active
tailings ponds across nine oil sands projects covering over 300 km2 of
the boreal forest.

There are many drivers to deforestation in the Amazon - in Colombia,
Ecuador and Peru, we\'re talking about oil.

They are located close to the Athabasca River - one of Canada's major
rivers that flows through Alberta and the Northwest Territories to
eventually join the Mackenzie River, which empties into **[[the Arctic

[Prudent risk management requires consideration of bad-to-worst-case
scenarios.]{.underline} Yet, for climate change, such potential futures
are poorly understood. Could anthropogenic [**[climate change result in
worldwide societal collapse or even eventual human extinction]{.mark}**?
At present, this is a dangerously underexplored topic. Yet **[there are
ample reasons]{.mark} to suspect that climate change could result in a
global catastrophe**]{.underline}. Analyzing the mechanisms for these
extreme consequences could help galvanize action, improve resilience,
and inform policy, including emergency responses. We outline current
knowledge about the likelihood of extreme climate change, discuss why
understanding bad-to-worst cases is vital, articulate reasons for
concern about catastrophic outcomes, define key terms, and put forward a
research agenda. The proposed agenda covers four main questions: 1) What
is the potential for climate change to drive mass extinction events? 2)
What are the mechanisms that could result in human mass mortality and
morbidity? 3) What are human societies\' vulnerabilities to
climate-triggered risk cascades, such as from conflict, political
instability, and systemic financial risk? 4) How can these multiple
strands of evidence---together with other global dangers---be usefully
synthesized into an "integrated catastrophe assessment["? It is time for
the scientific community to grapple with the challenge of better
understanding catastrophic climate change.]{.underline} How bad could
climate change get? As early as 1988, the landmark Toronto Conference
declaration described the ultimate consequences of climate change as
potentially "second only to a global nuclear war." Despite such
proclamations decades ago, climate catastrophe is relatively
under-studied and poorly understood.

The potential for catastrophic impacts depends on the magnitude and rate
of climate change, the damage inflicted on Earth and human systems, and
the vulnerability and response of those affected systems. [**[The
extremes]{.mark}** of these areas, such as **[high temperature rise and
cascading impacts]{.mark}**, are underexamined]{.underline}. As noted by
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), there have been
few quantitative estimates of global aggregate impacts from warming of
3 °C or above (1). Text mining of IPCC reports similarly found that
coverage of temperature rises of 3 °C or higher is underrepresented
relative to their likelihood (2). Text-mining analysis also suggests
that over time the coverage of IPCC reports has shifted towards
temperature rise of 2 °C and below. Research has focused on the impacts
of 1.5 °C and 2 °C, and studies of how climate impacts could cascade or
trigger larger crises are sparse.

A thorough risk assessment would need to consider how risks spread,
interact, amplify, and are aggravated by human responses (3), but even
[simpler "**[compound hazard]{.mark}**" analyses of interacting climate
hazards and drivers are underused. Yet this is how risk unfolds in the
real world.]{.underline} For example, a cyclone destroys electrical
infrastructure, leaving a population vulnerable to an ensuing deadly
heat wave (4). Recently, [we have seen compound hazards emerge between
climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic]{.underline} (5). As the IPCC
notes, [**[climate risks are becoming more complex and difficult to
manage, and are cascading across regions and sectors]{.mark}**
(6).]{.underline}

Why the focus on lower-end warming and simple risk analyses? One reason
is the benchmark of the international targets: the Paris Agreement goal
of limiting warming to well below 2 °C, with an aspiration of 1.5 °C.
Another reason is the culture of climate science to "err on the side of
least drama" (7), to not to be alarmists, which can be compounded by the
consensus processes of the IPCC (8). Complex risk assessments, while
more realistic, are also more difficult to do.

This caution is understandable, yet it is mismatched to the risks and
potential damages posed by climate change. We know that temperature rise
has "fat tails": low-probability, high-impact extreme outcomes (9).
C[limate damages are likely to be nonlinear and result in an even larger
tail (10). Too much is at stake to refrain from examining high-impact
low-likelihood scenarios.]{.underline} The COVID-19 pandemic has
underlined the need to consider and prepare for infrequent, high-impact
global risks, and the systemic dangers they can spark. Prudent risk
management demands that we thoroughly assess worst-case scenarios. Our
proposed "Climate Endgame" research agenda aims to direct exploration of
the worst risks associated with anthropogenic climate change. To
introduce it, we summarize existing evidence on the likelihood of
extreme climate change, outline why exploring bad-to-worst cases is
vital, suggest reasons for catastrophic concern, define key terms, and
then explain the four key aspects of the research agenda. Worst-Case
Climate Change

Despite 30 y of efforts and some progress under the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) anthropogenic greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions continue to increase. [Even without considering
worst-case climate responses, the current trajectory puts the world on
track for a temperature rise between 2.1 °C and 3.9 °C by
2100]{.underline} (11). If all 2030 nationally determined contributions
are fully implemented, warming of 2.4 °C (1.9 °C to 3.0 °C) is expected
by 2100. Meeting all long-term pledges and targets could reduce this to
2.1 °C (1.7 °C to 2.6 °C) (12). [Even **[these optimistic assumptions
lead to dangerous Earth system trajectories]{.mark}**. Temperatures of
more than 2 °C above preindustrial values have not been sustained on
Earth's surface since before the Pleistocene Epoch]{.underline} (or more
than 2.6 million years ago) (13).

Even if anthropogenic GHG emissions start to decline soon, this does not
rule out high future GHG concentrations or extreme climate change,
particularly beyond 2100. [There are **[feedbacks]{.mark}** in the
carbon cycle **[and]{.mark}** potential **[tipping points]{.mark}** that
could generate high GHG concentrations]{.underline} (14) that are often
missing from models. [Examples include Arctic permafrost thawing that
releases **[methane]{.mark}** and CO2 (15), carbon loss due to intense
droughts and fires in the Amazon (]{.underline}16), and the apparent
slowing of dampening feedbacks such as natural carbon sink capacity (17,
18). These are likely to not be proportional to warming, as is sometimes
assumed. [Instead, abrupt and/or **[irreversible changes]{.mark}** may
be triggered at a temperature threshold. Such changes are evident in
Earth's geological record, and their impacts cascaded across the coupled
climate--ecological--social system (19). Particularly worrying is **[a
"tipping cascade]{.mark}**" in which multiple tipping elements interact
in such a way that tipping one threshold increases the likelihood of
tipping another]{.underline} (20). Temperature rise is crucially
dependent on the overall dynamics of the Earth system, not just the
anthropogenic emissions trajectory.

**[What [we have seen with]{.mark} many [backsliding states, leaders are
able to consolidate power through]{.mark} completely [legal
means]{.mark}]{.underline}** (e.g., appointing new judges, changing
electoral laws, etc.). They can also work to manipulate elements outside
of political institutions---for example, owning or otherwise controlling
the national media. 2 For example, Mansfield and Snyder (1995);
Mansfield and Snyder (2009); Cederman et al. (2010); though see Narang
and Nelson (2009). 3 For example, Weeks (2008) and Weeks (2012). 4 For
example, Colgan and Weeks (2015); Croco and Weeks (2016); Croco (2011).
IGCC Working Paper No. 2 \| May 2024 4 This means the institutions
themselves remain intact---multiple branches of government still exist
and the rule of law still holds in theory---but the leader faces far
less accountability than a prototypical democratic leader. While this
has myriad domestic downsides, it also, as we argue here, has
international implications[. **[If leaders have a free hand]{.mark}
domestically, [this allows them to engage in risky foreign]{.mark}
policy [interactions]{.mark} or other aggressive pursuits. It also means
the likelihood of leaders being punished for bad foreign policy outcomes
is greatly reduced. [This further emboldens the leader]{.mark} to
challenge the international status quo.**]{.underline} To test our
argument, we empirically assess whether backsliding states engage in
more hostile interactions including both verbal (i.e., diplomatic
condemnation) and military (i.e., military show of force) with other
states compared to robust democracies.5 **[We also recognize the
[potential for endogeneity]{.mark} given the nonrandom nature [of
backsliding]{.mark}. To alleviate these concerns, we utilize a new fixed
effects counterfactual estimator6 that accounts for this issue. Our
results support our theory and remain consistent even when subjected to
several robustness checks. Our findings constitute an important step
forward in understanding the complex relationship between a state's
domestic regime attributes and its international behavior. [The
consequences of backsliding are not limited to the domestic
sphere]{.mark}. Indeed, [the effects often spill over]{.mark} into the
international realm [in the form of threats, aggression, or even
physical violence]{.mark}. The rest of this paper proceeds as follows.
Section 2 presents our theory as to why democratic [backsliding should
lead to aggressive international behavior]{.mark}. First, we briefly
discuss how backsliding leaders work to centralize power and reduce
domestic accountability. [We then explore how these changes]{.mark} in
the domestic sphere [encourage leaders to stir up discord with other
states]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Section 3 outlines our research design,
while Section 4 presents our empirical findings. Section 5 concludes
with a discussion of the implications of our findings and potential
avenues for future research.

The **[[fossil fuel industry's spread of deceptive]{.mark} or misleading
[info]{.mark}rmation [about climate change]{.mark}---often referred to
as disinformation and misinformation---[hurts democracies by undermining
public trust in gov]{.mark}ernment[s]{.mark}, [democratic
processes]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} even the notion of [objective
truth]{.mark} itself. Within the climate change discussion, the fossil
fuel [industry]{.mark}---whose emissions are the dominant cause of
global warming---has [made]{.mark} a [coordinated]{.mark}
[effort]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [spread]{.mark} climate
[disinfor]{.mark}mation and misinformation that prevents essential
action to address climate change. Through a sophisticated lobbying and
public influence machine targeting lawmakers and citizens, the fossil
fuel [industry]{.mark} has [undemocratically]{.mark} [shape]{.mark}d
[how the world thinks]{.mark} and talks about the climate
crisis.]{.underline}**

**[In particular, ["greenwashing"---]{.mark}when an entity depicts
itself as doing more on climate than it actually is---has become a
frequent industry [tactic]{.mark} to [distract from]{.mark} and delay
[meaningful proposals to reduce emissions]{.mark}. Greenwashing not only
[harms the public's ability to be well-informed]{.mark}; it also [erodes
public trust in scientific]{.mark} [consensus and genuine
solutions]{.mark} to the climate crisis. For instance, oil and gas
[companies]{.mark} often [tout]{.mark} their [investments]{.mark} [in
biofuels]{.mark} and hydrogen as evidence that they are taking action on
climate, [but]{.mark} these investments [are]{.mark} largely
[superficial]{.mark}]{.underline}** and vastly outweighed by the
continued reliance on fossil fuels that the industry perpetuates.

Industry's declared efforts to fight climate change fall woefully short,
with **[oil and gas companies often [devoting more attention to]{.mark}
creating the [appearance]{.mark} of working on climate solutions than
actually developing them.]{.underline}**

Fossil fuel companies greenwash their harmful practices not only with
direct advertising but also through their trade associations. Trade
associations effectively serve as public relations vehicles, touting the
so-called environmental commitments of the fossil fuel industry while
downplaying the environmental harms their core products cause. For
instance, the American Petroleum Institute (API) regularly publicizes
its member companies' investments in renewable energy and carbon
reduction technologies. On closer inspection, however, industry's
declared efforts to fight climate change fall woefully short, with oil
and gas companies often devoting more attention to creating the
appearance of working on climate solutions than actually developing
them.

**[Similar to greenwashing, the fossil fuel [industry]{.mark} also
[avoids]{.mark} [accountability]{.mark} [through "fossil fuel
solutionism"]{.mark} and "technological optimism," [creating]{.mark} the
[appearance of investing in low-carbon solutions]{.mark} while, in
reality, the industry expands fossil fuel production and carries on with
obstruction of meaningful climate policy. Individuals within the oil and
gas industry have bluntly admitted that [proposals]{.mark} such as these
[serve]{.mark} more [as ways to "shut up whoever we need to shut]{.mark}
[up"]{.mark} than to actually solve the climate crisis. Internal
communications from major fossil fuel companies show similar
contradictions]{.underline}**---such as Shell's guidance to employees
urging them "not give the impression that Shell is willing to reduce
carbon dioxide emissions to levels that do not make business sense."

[**Another influence [tactic]{.mark} used by the fossil fuel industry
and its allies is ["astroturfing,"]{.mark} by which they [create]{.mark}
an [artificial]{.mark} [appearance of grassroots support for]{.mark} an
[industry-friendly policy while concealing]{.mark} the support's
[true]{.mark} [origins]{.mark}. For example**,]{.underline} the
anti-offshore wind organization American Coalition for Ocean Protection
[(ACOP)]{.underline} [is a project of the Caesar Rodney Institute (CRI),
a think tank based in Delaware that has received funding from both
fossil fuel interests and the apparent astroturf group Protect Our Coast
NJ]{.underline}. Two CRI executives manage ACOP's Ocean Environment
Legal Defense Fund, the goal of which is to create a permanent offshore
wind exclusion zone. However, with [many of these groups also supporting
offshore oil drilling]{.underline}, their [opposition to wind farms
seems intended simply to slow down progress on this renewable competitor
to fossil fuels]{.underline}.

**[The oil and gas [industry]{.mark}'s public influence methods are
becoming increasingly sophisticated as they [hire major p]{.mark}ublic
[r]{.mark}elations [firms to promote]{.mark} their [false
narrative]{.mark}s and generate astroturf groups.]{.underline}**

**[Fossil fuel [companies]{.mark} and trade groups promote climate
obstruction through additional indirect methods, including by
[fund]{.mark}ing [think tanks and political candidates who deny the
reality of climate change]{.mark}. By casting doubt on climate science
and [portraying a false picture of scientific
debate]{.mark}]{.underline}**---even though oil and gas companies have
internally known about the climate threat for decades---[these companies
delay meaningful climate action]{.underline}.

The **[fossil fuel industry's influence campaigns do more than simply
mislead the public about climate change and oil and gas companies'
ostensible efforts to fight it; they also foment extreme false beliefs
on the issue. For example, the industry promotes fabricated narratives
such as warnings that proponents of climate action are supposedly
threatening to destroy individual liberty with a "climate lockdown."
Such [rhetoric serves to hyperpolarize]{.mark} the issue of [climate
change]{.mark} [into]{.mark} another front in the [culture war]{.mark}s,
[undermining societies' ability to reach]{.mark} productive, [democratic
consensus both in the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and
abroad]{.mark}. Around the world, far-right parties and candidates have
made opposition to climate action a major component of their populist
agenda.]{.underline}**

**[[With]{.mark} its [disproportionate financial and lobbying
influence]{.mark}, the fossil fuel [industry manipulates democratic
functions to undermine popular views]{.mark} and hamstring climate
action proposals that would serve the public interest. In the United
States alone, the fossil fuel industry spends tens of millions of
dollars to influence policymakers to keep the system rigged for itself.
So far in 2023, oil and gas companies and associations have spent almost
\$93 million on lobbying; and in 2022, it was more than \$125
million.]{.underline}** Between lobbying, political contributions, and
advertising efforts, these interests spent 27 times as much as climate
advocacy groups from 2008 to 2018 to obstruct climate action.

**Abusive fossil fuel industry undermines democratic
freedoms\-\--efforts include substantial lawsuits, anti protest
legislation, and voter suppression efforts.**

**[While polluting public discourse and manipulating governments
represent indirect attacks on democratic systems, the [fossil fuel
industry]{.mark} and its allies further [strengthen]{.mark} their
[influence by directly undermining the fundamental rights]{.mark} at the
heart [of free societies]{.mark}. They do this in [three main ways:
1)]{.mark} by [filing]{.mark} expensive, protracted strategic lawsuits
against public participation [(SLAPPs); 2)]{.mark} by [pushing
anti-protest legislation]{.mark}; and [3)]{.mark} by [promoting voter
suppression]{.mark} policies.]{.underline}**

[**In response to the 2016 Standing Rock protests in the United States,
Dakota Access Pipeline operator Energy Transfer Partners filed a
[SLAPP]{.mark} against protester[s]{.mark} to [prevent similar
demonstrations from spreading]{.mark}. Other instances abound, with
fossil fuel companies often misusing anti-racketeering Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) laws against protesters
simply to "send a message**,]{.underline}" even when they know their
chances of winning these lawsuits are slim.

[Similar examples of such lawsuits exist outside the United
States]{.underline}. In [Italy, for example, oil company Eni has
similarly deployed lawsuits against protesters]{.underline} and fossil
fuel dissenters [to delay climate action]{.underline}: In [July 2023,
Eni filed a SLAPP against Greenpeace Italy and ReCommon, and in 2021,
the company filed a claim against Italian newspaper]{.underline} Il
Fatto Quotidiano [for defamation.]{.underline}

The **[fossil fuel [industry's attempts]{.mark} to undermine democratic
freedoms also [include support for anti-protest laws that seek to
silence public criticism by criminalizing protest activity.]{.mark} As a
result of these efforts, some U.S. states have enacted anti-protest laws
that carry severe sentences for vague, speech-chilling
charges]{.underline}** such as attempting to "obstruct, impede, or
impair the services or transmissions of an energy facility."

Meanwhile, [in the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has
implemented both the Public Order Act of 2023 and the Policing, Crime,
Sentencing and Courts Act (PCSA), which undermine fundamental freedoms
to assemble and demonstrate]{.underline}. [Right-wing think tank Policy
Exchange, **which is funded by [major fossil fuel companies]{.mark} and
their allies, [help]{.mark}ed [draft]{.mark} the [legislation]{.mark}.
Since the passage of the PSCA, numerous U.K. climate activists,
particularly those operating under the Just Stop Oil umbrella, have been
arrested for their protest activities.**]{.underline}

**[The oil and gas industry's voter suppression efforts are directly
connected to its goal of thwarting the fight against climate
change.]{.underline}**

**[The fossil fuel [industry]{.mark} has [also played]{.mark} a [major
role in promoting voter suppression]{.mark}, which disproportionately
affects voters who most strongly favor climate and environmental justice
policies. [Between 2015 and 2020,]{.mark} fossil fuel interests [donated
millions to state lawmakers who backed voter suppression
bills]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This [support includes funding the
organizations leading the voter suppression charge. For example, fossil
fuel giant Koch Industries is a key funder of organizations such as the
Honest Elections Project, a spinoff of the right-wing American
Legislative Exchange Council]{.underline} (ALEC), [which]{.underline}
[has been]{.underline} instrumental in [pushing voter suppression and
other anti-democratic proposals]{.underline}.

These voter suppression efforts are directly connected to the fossil
fuel industry's goal of thwarting the fight against climate change.
Notably[, **voter suppression disproportionately disenfranchises
communities of color, low-income groups, and Indigenous
peoples---communities that favor environmental regulation and climate
change legislation significantly more than other demographics. Because
such groups are also more likely to vote for candidates who support
climate justice, [suppressing]{.mark} their [votes]{.mark} can help
[prevent]{.mark} the [election of lawmakers that favor real policy

authoritarianism increases it**

**[[Democratic peace theory posits that democracies do not go to
war]{.mark} with one another, while [democratic alliance theory
suggests]{.mark} that [they rarely]{.mark}, if ever, [join nondemocratic
alliances]{.mark} (or alliances led by nondemocratic powers). [Empirical
evidence strongly supports both theories. The Atlantic Council's Freedom
and Prosperity Indexes further reinforces]{.mark} the hypothesis
[that]{.mark} economically prosperous democracies tend to align with one
another, whereas [authoritarian states gravitate toward similarly
nondemocratic]{.mark} and less prosperous
[partners.]{.mark} ]{.underline}**

If these theories hold, they carry significant implications for Western
and especially US foreign policy. **[First, [global democratization
would reduce the number of potential conflicts]{.mark}, at least among
an increasing number of democracies. Second, [it would expand the pool
of democratic alliance partners]{.mark}, while at the same limiting the
alliance options available to nondemocratic powers. [This strategic
logic underscores the importance of upholding democratic norms abroad
and promoting democratization in nondemocratic
states.]{.mark} ]{.underline}**
