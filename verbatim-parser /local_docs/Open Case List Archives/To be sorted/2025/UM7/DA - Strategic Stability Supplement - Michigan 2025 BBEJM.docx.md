**Note: 'SNNW' = strategic non-nuclear weapons**

The backdrop: [the **Third Nuclear Age**]{.underline}

[**Tech**nological and **political developments** over the
last]{.underline} few decades [have brought us to a point where
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} global [**nuclear [order]{.mark}** [is
**changing**]{.mark}]{.underline} from being 'based on the assumption
that developments in nuclear weapons are the primary driver of stability
and instability, to one in which [[**non-nuclear capabilities** play
an]{.mark} **equally**]{.underline}, if not more [[important
role]{.underline}']{.mark} (Futter and Zala 2021, 258). These SNNW
include hypersonic (and other precision-strike) [conventional
missiles]{.underline}, [**[missile defence]{.mark}**
systems]{.underline}, [[**anti-satellite** and
**anti-sub**]{.mark}marine warfare **capabilities**]{.underline}, [and
supporting **systems**]{.underline} and platforms [[such as]{.mark}
advanced **[remote sensing]{.mark}** and cyber and AI
platforms]{.underline}. These capabilities are all unencumbered by the
pol-itical and moral restraints associated with the nuclear taboo, which
therefore makes them, seem more 'usable' in crisis situations
(Tannenwald 2007).

[[None]{.mark} of these **capabilities**]{.underline} can
**[[threaten]{.underline}]{.mark}** even [[a]{.mark} small **nuclear
[arsenal today]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[But]{.mark} **rapid
[advances]{.mark}**]{.underline} in SNNW in recent years, [and the
prospect of their combined use]{.underline} (in which, for example a
missile defence system need only defend against a retaliatory force that
has been greatly depleted and compromised in a conventional ﬁrst strike)
[have **[ensure]{.mark}**d that all **nuclear**-armed [**states** are
**less conﬁdent**]{.mark} than they]{.underline} once [were in the
survivability of their forces]{.underline} in the future. Put simply,
[[due to **tech**]{.mark}nological [breakthroughs]{.mark} in **remote
sensing**]{.underline}, [missile **accuracy**]{.underline},
[**a**utonomous **w**eapons **s**ystems]{.underline}, [and defensive
systems]{.underline}, [[nuclear forces are]{.underline}]{.mark} both
[more **[vulnerable]{.mark}**]{.underline} to attack, [[and less
**reliable**]{.underline}]{.mark} for purposes of retaliation.1

While 'less reliable' might be reliable enough for now given the immense
destructive-ness of nuclear weapons and the still early stages of
development and deployment of some SNNW technologies (as well as the
continuing diﬃculties associated with reliable missile defence), [it is
[the]{.mark} **shadow of the [future]{.mark}** that [is driving]{.mark}
**nuclear [decisions today]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Zala 2019).
[Decisions about]{.underline} nuclear force [postures]{.underline}
([including]{.underline} their [**[c]{.mark}**ommand [and
**c**]{.mark}ontrol]{.underline} systems) today [[are driven by]{.mark}
assessments of [**worst-case** scenarios]{.mark} that will need to be
**avoided** in the future]{.underline}. The [[most
plausible]{.underline}]{.mark} worst-case scenario in the Third Nuclear
Age [[would be]{.mark} a **[non-nuclear ﬁrst
strike]{.mark}**]{.underline} by an adversary [[that believed it could
deny]{.mark} any [**retaliatory strike** through]{.mark} the use
of]{.underline} oﬀensive and defensive [**[SNNW]{.mark}**
forces]{.underline} (Futter and Zala 2021, 264). [[If the only]{.mark}
form of]{.underline} relative [**[stability]{.mark}** that nuclear-armed
states have]{.underline} to rely on [[is]{.mark} the [deterrent]{.mark}
eﬀect]{.underline} of an assured retaliation to a ﬁrst strike, [[then
anything that **undermines** this between]{.underline}]{.mark} two
**[[nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark}**-armed
[[adversaries]{.underline}]{.mark}, logically [[undermines **strategic
stability**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

US and NATO nuclear strategy

[US **nuclear deterrence**]{.underline} strategy [[plays a
**fundamental** role in]{.mark} underpinning]{.underline} international
[**peace** and **[security]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Unlike
Russia]{.underline} and other nuclear powers that build a nuclear force
to advance their narrow national aims, [[US **nuc**]{.mark}lear
weapon**[s]{.mark}** [defend the]{.mark}]{.underline} entire free
[[world]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Washington extends **nuclear deterrence**
to]{.underline} more than **[thirty]{.underline}** formal [treaty
allies]{.underline} in Europe and the Indo-Pacific. More than half of
global gross domestic product is protected by US nuclear weapons.

To maintain deterrence in this challenging security environment, the
United States, NATO, and other US allies and partners need a strategy
capable of deterring and, if necessary, defeating China and Russia
simultaneously. The free world has an interest in maintaining peace and
stability in Europe and the Indo-Pacific, and it cannot afford to allow
strategic deterrence to fail in either region.

[To **maintain deterrence**]{.underline}, [[the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline} and its allies [[should
**maintain**]{.mark} their **[long-standing]{.mark}** and **successful**
[deterrence]{.mark} strategy]{.underline}. The
[[fundamentals]{.underline}]{.mark} of deterrence **[[have not
changed]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [US]{.underline} and NATO [[policy
should]{.underline}]{.mark} strive to [[persuade]{.underline}]{.mark}
potential [[adversaries]{.mark} that the cost of [aggression
**outweighs**]{.mark} any]{.underline} potential
**[[benefits]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as the adversary perceives it.
Deterrence is about holding at risk that which the adversary holds dear.
As the 1983 Scowcroft Commission explained, "[[Deterrence
is]{.underline}]{.mark} the set of [[**beliefs** in the minds of]{.mark}
the **[Soviet leaders]{.mark}**]{.underline}, given their own values and
attitudes, [about **our capabilities** and **our will**]{.underline}. It
requires us to determine, as best we can, what would deter them from
considering aggression, even in a crisis---not to determine what would
deter us."

#### 'Reciprocal development' is [wrong]{.underline}. Russia doesn't have the [capabilities]{.underline} to develop the plan's [tech]{.underline} because of [data shortfalls]{.underline}\-\--that makes [first strike]{.underline} their [sole]{.underline} option.

Vulnerability of AI Systems May Explain Why Russia Isn't Using Them

But [aside from **Russian influence campaigns** with]{.underline} their
much-discussed "**[deep fakes]{.underline}**" [and
**misinformation**]{.underline}-spreading bots, the [[lack
of]{.underline}]{.mark} known [[**tactical** use]{.underline}]{.mark}
(at least publicly) [[of **AI**]{.mark} by the Russian military has
[surprised]{.mark}]{.underline} many [[observers]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Andrew Lohn isn't one of them.

Lohn, a senior fellow with Georgetown University's Center for Security
and Emerging Technology, works on its Cyber-AI Project, which is seeking
to draw policymakers' attention to the growing body of academic research
showing that AI and machine-learning (ML) algorithms can be attacked in
a variety of basic, readily exploitable ways.

"We have perhaps the most aggressive cyber actor in the world in Russia
who has twice turned off the power to Ukraine and used cyber-attacks in
Georgia more than a decade ago. [[Most]{.mark} of us [expected]{.mark}
the [**digital domain** to play a]{.mark}]{.underline} much [[**larger**
role]{.underline}]{.mark}. It's been small so far," Lohn says.

"We have a whole bunch of hypotheses \[for limited AI use\] but we don't
have answers. Our program is trying to collect all the information we
can from this encounter to figure out which are most likely."

They range from the potential effectiveness of Ukrainian cyber and
counter-information operations, to [an unexpected [**shortfall**
in]{.mark} Russian [**preparedness** for **digital
warfare**]{.mark}]{.underline} in Ukraine, to Russia's need to preserve
or simplify the digital operating environment for its own tactical
reasons.

All probably [[play some **role**]{.underline}]{.mark}, Lohn believes,
but just as crucial may be a dawning recognition of the limits and
vulnerability of AI/ML. The willingness to deploy AI tools in combat is
a confidence game.

Junk In, Junk Out

[**[A]{.mark}**rtificial **[i]{.mark}**ntelligence and **m**achine
**l**earning [require]{.mark}]{.underline} vast amounts of
**[[data]{.underline}]{.mark}**, both [[for **training**]{.mark} and to
interpret]{.underline} for **[alerts]{.underline}**, insights or action.
Even when **[[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}**/**[ML]{.underline}** have access
to an unimpeded base of data, they [are [only as good as]{.mark} the
**[information]{.mark}**]{.underline} and assumptions [[which]{.mark}
**underlie** them]{.underline}. If for no other reason than natural
variability, [both [can be]{.mark} **significantly
[flawed]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Whether AI/ML systems work as advertised
is a "huge question," Lohn acknowledges.

The tech community refers to unanticipated information as "Out of
Distribution" data. **[[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}**/ML [[may
perform]{.mark} at what is deemed to be]{.underline} an
[[acceptable]{.underline}]{.mark} level [[in]{.mark} a **laboratory**
or]{.underline} in otherwise **[[controlled
conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Lohn explains. "Then [when you throw
it **[in]{.mark}**to [the **real world**]{.mark}]{.underline}, some of
[[what it experiences is **different**]{.underline}]{.mark} in some way.
You don't know how well it will perform in those circumstances."

### Link\-\--Quantum\-\--2NC

#### The plan's [quantum tech]{.underline} facilitates detection of Russian [SSBNs]{.underline} AND enables [precise nuclear strikes]{.underline}\-\--that [eviscerates]{.underline} strategic stability.

[Typically]{.underline}, [**[sub]{.mark}**marine**[s leverage]{.mark}**
several [methods to remain **concealed**]{.mark}]{.underline}: the
massive volume of ocean water, acoustic silence, and measures to reduce
their electromagnetic signature---the distortions created by the metal
of the vessel's hull.

[But [if **quantum**]{.mark} **tech**nology [becomes]{.mark} the
**[standard]{.mark}**]{.underline}, these [[methods]{.mark} will [no
longer]{.mark} be **[enough]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[Currently]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[detecting submerged
**submarines**]{.mark} with]{.underline} sonar or electromagnetic
[sensors [requires]{.mark} relative **physical
[proximity]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[but]{.underline} two odd properties
of [[quantum]{.mark} physics could]{.underline} greatly
[[increase]{.mark} **detection [range]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

One of them is quantum entanglement. This refers to the odd phenomenon
by which [one particle's behavior can be]{.underline} closely related,
or "**[entangled]{.underline}**," [with another]{.underline},
potentially [distant particle]{.underline}. That makes it possible for
some **[quantum [sensors]{.mark}]{.underline}** that read nearby
particles to also [[provide **information**]{.mark} on the activity of a
faraway particle]{.underline}.

Secondly, [quantum [superposition]{.mark}]{.underline}---[the ability to
maintain more than one state
simultaneously]{.underline}---[would]{.underline} potentially
[[facilitate an]{.mark} **exponential [increase]{.mark}** [in
**computing** power]{.mark} for onboard instruments that receive
**sensor data**]{.underline}. Today's quantum computers already do this,
storing data not only like a classical computer that works in binary
(either 0 or 1), but in qubits, which consider additional possibilities
such as both 0 and 1 simultaneously.

Currently, [detection instruments]{.underline} called gravimeters and
magnetometers [enable detection of the submarines **several hundred
feet** away]{.underline}. However, they can be adapted, [using
**[quantum]{.mark}**]{.underline} technology, to [[detect **subs**
from]{.underline}]{.mark} several [**[miles]{.mark}** away]{.underline}.

Quantum gravimeters are already used in multiple fields, including for
the study of volcanoes and melting ice sheets. They detect miniscule
gravitational fields by sensing how they "pull" free-falling atoms that
have been laser-cooled and super-positioned into multiple states
simultaneously. [Adapted for a **submarine**]{.underline}, [a
**[quantum]{.mark}**]{.underline}-equipped [magnetometer
could]{.underline} be used to [read the subtle variations of the Earth's
**magnetic fields**]{.underline} like a map. Because [it **[accurately
determines position]{.mark}**]{.underline}, it would obviate a
submarine's need for indiscretion time near the surface.

[**[Quantum]{.mark}** sensors]{.underline} might also [[give]{.mark}
submarines [a **new tool** to]{.mark}]{.underline} quietly **[[detect
enemies]{.underline}]{.mark}** without resorting to noisy active sonar.
And, such sensors would provide the means to receive more detailed
communication signals while more deeply submerged. A
[quantum]{.underline} gravimeter [could]{.underline} also [be used
to]{.underline} more accurately [detect and analyze enemy
**transmissions**]{.underline}, since the [quantum tech
could]{.underline} simultaneously [survey a broader
bandwidth]{.underline} than is possible using traditional systems.

Furthermore, [[**quantum navigation** might]{.underline}]{.mark}---if
sufficiently miniaturized---also [[enable **long-range weapons**
to]{.mark} precisely [strike]{.mark} a target]{.underline} over huge
distances, even when denied satellite navigation access.

Today, submarine-hunting aircraft use conventional magnetometers that
are mostly effective just above half a mile. However, engineers have
come up with a type of magnetometer called a
**[[SQUID]{.underline}]{.mark}** (for [Superconducting Quantum
Interference Device]{.underline}), which [has the potential to **[boost
detection range]{.mark}**]{.underline} to 3.7 miles---hypothetically
[covering]{.underline} over [a **hundred times** more surface
area]{.underline}. [SQUID]{.underline} technology [for
submarine]{.underline} detection [could]{.underline} eventually become
lighter, smaller, and more practical, and [offer
orders]{.underline}-[of]{.underline}-magnitude **[higher
resolution]{.underline}** than conventional magnetometers.

Lastly, quantum technology's potential to massively increase computing
power could one day enable autonomous submarine combat
missions---without the need for a crew. The first relatively large,
fully autonomous XLUUV-class drone submarines are entering U.S. military
service to perform specialized missions. But more powerful AI with
quantum computing might enable XLUUVs to perform a wider range of combat
missions at a fraction of the cost and size of manned submarines.

[Quantum detection [sensors]{.mark}]{.underline} could give vessels
plying the surface of the water an advantage, too. Installing such
sensors [[on]{.mark} patrolling **aircraft [carriers]{.mark}**
[or]{.mark} **transport** [ships]{.mark} could [make
it]{.mark}]{.underline} [very [**dangerous** for **submarines** to
infiltrate]{.underline}]{.mark} [close to **key targets**]{.underline}.

#### Quantum enables [ASW]{.underline} that detect [SSBNs]{.underline}\-\--that [undermines]{.underline} strategic stability, causing [use-or-lose]{.underline} pressures and [first-strike]{.underline}.

**[Nuclear Stability]{.underline}** at Sea

[Understanding]{.underline} the [importance of]{.underline}
nuclear-armed submarines (**[SSBNs]{.underline}**), or strategic
submarines, first [requires an understanding of how **strat**egic
**stab**ility is maintained]{.underline}. [**[Strat]{.mark}**egic
**[stab]{.mark}**ility [is]{.mark} a state of **nuclear stability**
[where there are no incentives for]{.mark} states to engage in an
[**arms race** and]{.mark} no incentives for states to]{.underline}
deliberately **[[escalate]{.underline}]{.mark}** crises [to gain an
**upper hand**]{.underline}.

Under the auspices of mutually assured destruction,
[**[strat]{.mark}**egic **[stab]{.mark}**ility is [maintained due
to]{.mark} the [idea that]{.mark} no matter what]{.underline},
[[launching]{.underline}]{.mark} a nuclear [**[first strike]{.mark}**
will [result in]{.mark}]{.underline} the retaliatory
[**[annihilation]{.mark}** of the attacking state]{.underline}. In order
to ensure that there are no incentives to launch a nuclear assault or
engage in arms racing, [all]{.underline} nuclear-armed [[states should
have]{.underline}]{.mark} total [[confidence in]{.mark} their **nuclear
[second-strike]{.mark}** capacity]{.underline}. At the most basic level,
[this requires]{.underline} secure warhead containment and transport,
and robust [**nuclear c**ommand]{.underline}, [**c**ontrol]{.underline},
[and **c**ommunication]{.underline}.

Alongside the continued advancement of nuclear arsenals, states have
sought the development of strategic non-nuclear weapons (SNNWs) to
counter and destroy an enemy's nuclear arsenal. In recent decades,
however, the rapid development of these weapons has damaged
nuclear-armed states' confidence in their ability to retaliate following
a nuclear attack. Because of the [advancement of]{.underline} weapons
systems such as [**[b]{.mark}**allistic **[m]{.mark}**issile
**[d]{.mark}**efence]{.underline},
[**[anti-sat]{.mark}**ellite]{.underline}, [[and
**anti-sub**]{.mark}marine **[tech]{.mark}**nologies]{.underline},
[nuclear]{.underline}-armed [states]{.underline} may
[[have]{.underline}]{.mark} more of an [[incentive to **arms
race**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Strategic [**[sub]{.mark}**marine**[s]{.mark}** play an
[essential]{.mark}]{.underline} and unique [role [in upholding
**strat**]{.mark}egic **[stab]{.mark}**ility]{.underline}. In comparison
to the land and air components of the nuclear triad, strategic
[submarines are]{.underline} incredibly [hard to track and
monitor]{.underline} due to the complexity, depth, and vastness of the
earth's oceans. Since their inception, [**[SSBNs]{.mark}** have been
heralded as the [**last bastion** of defence]{.mark} for a]{.underline}
state's [nuclear arsenal because of]{.underline} their
**[concealability]{.underline}**: if all else fails in the event of a
nuclear attack, a state will always have a retaliatory capacity due to
their hidden submarines. However, the [[advancement of **ASW**]{.mark}
capabilities]{.underline} threaten to [[undermine]{.mark} this
**[confidence]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} can
[disturb]{.underline} nuclear **[stability]{.underline}**.

AUKUS and Anti-Submarine Technology

Among the plethora of defence technologies which AUKUS may bring to the
table for Australia, the potential to enhance Australia's ASW
capabilities may end up being problematic for nuclear stability.
Although there has been no explicit announcement of an anti-submarine
project, Australia has indicated a focus on ASW in its future
acquisition projects. The acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines,
Hunter-class frigates, and statements on ASW in the Australian Defence
2020 Force Structure Plan show a focus on deterring and defending
against Chinese maritime assertiveness through ASW.

[[With]{.underline}]{.mark} the increased [[focus on]{.mark} **critical
tech**nologies such as]{.underline} AI and **[[quantum]{.mark}
computing]{.underline}**, [further [breakthroughs in **ASW**]{.mark}
technologies [are **likely**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, the
[current development]{.underline} of AI and sensor technology [for ocean
monitoring]{.underline}, [as well as advancements in underwater
**communications**]{.underline}, will likely [assist in making the
ocean]{.underline} "**[transparent]{.underline}**" by 2050. This is
highly concerning, as [gaining the [ability to
**track**]{.mark}]{.underline} and surveil strategic
[**[sub]{.mark}**marine**[s]{.mark}** will]{.underline} significantly
[[reduce confidence in]{.underline}]{.mark} nuclear-armed states'
**[[second-strike]{.mark} capability]{.underline}**.

The pursuit of this technological advancement for hunting nuclear-armed
submarines will have considerable implications for AUKUS in the form of
technology transfer. In 2016, the US renewed the Cold War-era Sound
Surveillance System (SOSUS). Although SOSUS proved ineffective during
the Cold War, a suite of emerging technologies such as AI,
[**[quantum]{.mark}** technology]{.underline}, and underwater drones
have [[increased]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[effectiveness of
hunting]{.underline}]{.mark} and tracking nuclear-armed
[**[sub]{.mark}**marine**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

For Australia, the information and technology transfer agreement
underpinning AUKUS will likely lead to the Royal Australian Navy
acquiring similar ASW technologies for future programs, such as the
anti-submarine-focused Future Frigate Program. With this technology from
the US and the continued focus on ASW, Australia will likely control a
formidable suite of anti-submarine technologies capable of hunting out
and tracking Chinese and Russian SSBNs. Although this may serve
Australia's short-term maritime defence aspirations, it also brings
looming complications for regional nuclear stability.

The Irony of Embracing Destruction -- Protecting Nuclear-Weapons

In order [to protect regional **nuclear stability**]{.underline} in the
coming years, the [[impacts of **new**]{.mark} **defence
[tech]{.mark}**nologies [must be]{.mark}]{.underline} carefully
**[[considered]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Though they provide new
capability and contribute to Australia's maritime deterrent, the
[[development]{.underline}]{.mark} of maritime counterforce measures
such as sound surveillance and passive acoustic monitoring [may
[undermine **strat**]{.mark}egic **[stab]{.mark}**ility]{.underline}.
Although it may be ironic to support nuclear arsenals in order to
protect against nuclear war, [[maintaining]{.mark} **Russian** and
**Chinese [confidence]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the [safety of]{.mark} their
**[nuc]{.mark}**lear weapon**[s]{.mark}** will [reduce **incentives** to
launch]{.mark} a **[first-strike]{.mark}**]{.underline} against the US
or its regional allies.

\<\<\<TEXT CONDENSED NONE OMITTED\>\>\>

AI in the Cold War AI pioneer Marvin Minsky defined AI as "the science
of making machines do things that would require intelligence if done by
men" (Minsky, 1968, p. v). Since AI research began in the 1950s, the
boundaries of the field have shifted as computers have reshaped how
humans comprehend "intelligence." AI has also evolved as theoretical
paradigms have shifted in and out of vogue. From the 1950s until the
1980s, a "symbolic" paradigm that aimed to replicate high-level human
reasoning predominated, only to be supplanted by a "connectionist"
paradigm that sought to emulate the biological basis of human cognition
using artificial neural networks. In the 20th century, neither paradigm
worked particularly well outside laboratory demonstrations. This
triggered occasional periods (sometimes characterized as AI winters)
during which funding for AI research was scarce. Thanks to decades of
progress in computer science, advances in computing and communications
hardware and software, and the rise of cloud computing and big data, AI
has advanced rapidly in the past few years, most prominently in the
field of "deep neural networks" (DNNs), or neural networks with many
layers (Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville, 2016). The increase in the
performance of DNNs has been so spectacular that they have become almost
synonymous with AI, but in actuality the older paradigms are also
continuing to progress and are in widespread commercial and military
use. Some impressive recent AI systems, such as Alphabet DeepMind's
AlphaGo program, which beat the world Go champion, employ DNNs in
combination with such older techniques as searching the tree of possible
moves. One thing that has remained constant over AI's 60-year history is
its proponents' high hopes. With enough intelligence, might it be
possible to conquer such seemingly impossible problems as poverty and
illness---or even win a nuclear war? The intersection between AI and
nuclear warfare became a science fiction cliché more than 50 years ago,
but their real-world connections are even older. The earliest AI
researchers were deeply involved in national security work and secured
government support by suggesting that their theoretical studies would
soon translate into practical military applications. Claude Shannon
asserted in his foundational 1950 article "Programming a Computer for
Playing Chess" that making computers play that venerable game would
impart theoretical insights that would make "machines for making
strategic decisions in simplified military operations" possible "in the
nearterm future" (Shannon, 1950, p. 256). In the mid-1950s, researchers
created the earliest working AI programs with support from the U.S. Air
Force (Simon and Newell, 1958; Newell, Shaw, and Simon, 1959). Potential
applications of such machines soon began appearing in the writings of
strategic theorists. In the late 1950s, Herman Kahn postulated the
notion of "doomsday machines" that would employ 10 computers programmed
to recognize unacceptable enemy provocations and retaliate (Kahn, 1960,
pp. 145--154). While Kahn intended these as thought experiments
illustrating how not to conduct nuclear strategy, science fiction
authors latched onto the idea of intelligent computers controlling
nuclear weapons, inspiring numerous novels and such films as Colossus
(1970), WarGames (1983), and Terminator (1984). While fictional
thrillers spin tales of nuclear armed computers run amok, real-world
attempts to apply AI to nuclear strategic problems tended to be much
more mundane. Neither U.S. nor Soviet officials were inclined to entrust
launch decisions to computers, both because they jealously reserved this
prerogative for themselves and because automating retaliation was not a
logical response to difficult strategic problems, such as compellence or
crisis stability. The sole notable exception came from the Soviet Union
at the end of the Cold War. Perceiving that the United States aspired to
a first-strike capability and anxious that they might be the objects of
a decapitation strike, Soviet leaders sought measures to ensure that
capitalist aggressors would never go unpunished.6 The Soviet Union
reportedly considered developing a system that would have automatically
launched surviving ICBMs at the United States following a first strike
if it could not contact the Soviet political leadership. It seems that
the fully automated version, nicknamed the "Dead Hand," was rejected in
favor of a version, dubbed "Perimetr," that would automatically delegate
launch authority to field commanders but would always require a human in
the loop (Hoffman, 2009). According to Russian media accounts, the
Perimetr system still exists and uses some kind of AI.7 The United
States, meanwhile, explored the possibility that AI could be used to
bolster its counterforce capability. One late 1980s research project,
the Survivable Adaptive Planning Experiment (SAPE), sought to use the AI
technology of the time to enable the United States to target the Soviet
Union's mobile ICBM launchers. The SAPE would not control nuclear
weapons directly; rather, it would employ expert systems to translate
reconnaissance data into nuclear targeting plans that would then be
carried out by manned B-2 bombers. The SAPE was just one part of an
envisioned suite of systems and capabilities that, if actualized, would
have severely challenged the survivability of the Soviet Union's nuclear
arsenal (Roland and Shiman, 2002, p. 305; Long and Green, 2012).

[**AI** and the Emerging **Geopolitical Order**]{.underline}

Although 20th-century AI struggled to actualize these applications,
more-recent advances in computing could release their potential. Such
contemporary techniques as deep learning are dramatically advancing
machine vision and other signal processing applications, which can
enhance autonomy and sensor fusion. Autonomy and sensor fusion may be of
paramount strategic relevance because they could greatly improve ISR,
ATR, and terminal guidance capabilities. [All of these
might]{.underline} severely [**erode** the means by which **nuclear
powers** assure]{.underline} the [**survivability** of their nuclear
forces]{.underline}. Because [increased weapon accuracy]{.underline} has
long since [undermined the survivability of]{.underline} silo-based
**[ICBMs]{.underline}**, [the **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}, [Russia]{.underline}, [and China [put
**nuc**]{.mark}lear weapon**[s]{.mark}** [on
**submarines**]{.mark}]{.underline} and mobile ICBMs [that were deemed
**more likely** to survive a **first strike**]{.underline}.
[**[Tech]{.mark}**nologies that [make it]{.mark} more [likely]{.mark}
that **survivable forces**]{.underline} ([such as **[submarine]{.mark}**
and **mobile missiles**]{.underline}) [[could be **targeted**]{.mark}
and destroyed make it more plausible that one country might]{.underline}
threaten a **[first strike]{.underline}**. [[This undermines **strategic
stability**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [because [even if]{.mark} the
[state]{.mark} possessing these capabilities [has no intention
of]{.mark}]{.underline} actually [[using them]{.underline}]{.mark}, [the
**[adversary cannot be sure]{.mark}** of that]{.underline}. Thus, the
[[capabilities]{.mark} can]{.underline} still be used to
**[[pressure]{.underline}]{.mark}** potential [[adversaries]{.mark}
and]{.underline} perhaps [extract **concessions**]{.underline} during a
crisis. Such [a capability does not have to be
**exploited**]{.underline} during a crisis [to be politically
useful]{.underline}. As Alfred T. Mahan observed, "force is never more
operative than when it is known to exist but is not brandished" (Mahan,
1912, p. 105). As long as adversaries fear that the capability may
exist, they can be cowed into submission without explicit
confrontation---the more powerful state can in effect preemptively "win"
the crisis. As a consequence, [[counterforce]{.mark} targeting
capability]{.underline} is an enticing prospect for many despite its
potential to [[compromise]{.mark} **strategic
[stability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. AI
[**[tech]{.mark}**nologies]{.underline} could help [[enable]{.mark} new
[**breakthroughs** in]{.mark} **tracking** and **targeting** and in
**[antisub]{.mark}**marine warfare or make it easier for]{.underline}
high-precision [conventional munitions to **destroy**]{.underline}
hardened ICBM [silos]{.underline} (Holmes, 2016). Such [capabilities
would be]{.underline} especially [destabilizing]{.underline} because
[decisionmakers could]{.underline} threaten to [employ **conventional**
weapons]{.underline} much [more plausibly than]{.underline} any kind of
[nuclear attack]{.underline}. [A [conventional]{.mark} threat [would
place]{.mark} the adversary under **[enormous
pressure]{.mark}**]{.underline} during a crisis, [[which
could]{.underline}]{.mark} force it to capitulate---but could also
[[spiral into **nuclear war**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Such [escalation
could happen because the adversary felt the need to use its
weapons]{.underline} before being disarmed, in retaliation for an
unsuccessful disarming strike, or simply [[because]{.mark} the crisis
triggered **[accidental use]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Potential U.S.
[adversaries]{.underline}, such as Russia, [take seriously the
possibility that the **U**nited **S**tates might leverage its
advantage]{.underline} in such technologies as AI [to]{.underline}
radically [improve its **counterforce**]{.underline} capabilities. For
the past several years, Russian military [analysts]{.underline} have
been engaged in a vociferous debate in the military press about the
extent of their country's strategic vulnerabilities.8 Their tendency to
[assume]{.underline} that current and **[future]{.underline}** U.S.
[[capabilities pose a]{.mark} **dire [threat]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}
Russia's]{.underline} security stokes these
**[[anxieties]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A major challenge of nuclear
strategy is that [[adversaries]{.mark} may **[interpret]{.mark}** one
nation's]{.underline} secure [[**retaliatory** forces as a first-strike
threat]{.mark} or a doomsday machine [and **react**]{.mark}
accordingly]{.underline}. For instance, the Russians probably conceived
of Status-6 as a last-ditch second-strike option exploiting AI to
autonomously circumvent U.S. defenses, but Western observers interpreted
it as a Strangelovean "cobalt bomb." AI [progress is]{.underline} also
[contributing to Russia's doubling down on **old**er]{.underline} types
of [systems with **undesirable strategic properties**]{.underline}. For
example, with its RS-28 "Sarmat" missile, [Russia]{.underline} is
[reinvesting in]{.underline} large, silobased ICBMs with multiple
independently targetable reentry vehicle (**[MIRV]{.underline}**)
[warheads]{.underline}, [a]{.underline} category of [weapon it once
planned to abandon]{.underline} under the now-defunct Strategic Arms
Reduction Talks II treaty. [Western]{.underline} strategic
[theory]{.underline} generally [considers]{.underline} large [**MIRVed**
ICBMs to be **destabilizing**]{.underline} because [they are ideal for
**preemptive strikes** and are vulnerable to
**preemption**]{.underline}. At the dawn of the millennium, Moscow
believed that it could ensure the survivability of its forces by
emphasizing mobile ICBMs and scrapping large silo-based missiles
inherited from the Soviet Union. However, [**[Russian]{.mark}** leaders'
[**anxieties** about]{.mark} potential U.S.
**[threats]{.mark}**]{.underline} to the survivability of the mobile
ICBMs seem to [have **[change]{.mark}**d this **[calculus]{.mark}** [and
led]{.mark} them to try [to]{.mark} **ensure [retaliation]{.mark}** [by
**launching**]{.mark} during a]{.underline} U.S. [**attack** instead of
riding it out]{.underline}.

The [**[assurance]{.mark}** of a **nuclear response** to a nuclear

[[**Sanctions** against Russia have been
**severe**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and Ukrainian forces have been
receiving weapons, equipment, and valuable intelligence from Western
nations, which have allowed them to deploy unexpected force against
Russian troops---fiercely contesting their invasion and causing
thousands of casualties, loss of tanks, and other armored vehicles,
rocket launchers, aircraft, and ships. [**[Diplomatic efforts]{.mark}**
to [keep **Russia isolated**]{.mark} have also been
**crucial**]{.underline}.

However, Russia's indiscriminate attacks against Ukrainian
civilians---including bombing hospitals and schools as well as the use
of horrific weapons, such as cluster bombs and white phosphorus---should
drive the West to reevaluate its war engagement policy and take a more
active role by implementing a no-fly zone or securing evacuation
corridors---perhaps even actively fighting Russian forces.

The main concern is any such escalation could lead to World War III.
There are two reasons that this is unlikely. The first is that
[**[Russia]{.mark}**'s military [**capabilities** are **poor**]{.mark}
relative to those of Western armies]{.underline}. Their [[**forces** are

Arms Race Stability

As noted in the MAD section, a [certain balance was found within
MAD]{.underline}. [However]{.underline}, it was [constantly shifting
between the bipolar sides as each sought advantage]{.underline} and
undertook innovative technologies, tactics, and doctrines. The U.[S. and
Soviet Union were driven to]{.underline} maintain a credible deterrent,
[expanding their arsenals at a comparable pace to sustain strategic
balance]{.underline}. The [**[paradox]{.mark}** was that the **[more
nuclear weapons]{.mark}** each side had, the **[greater]{.mark} the
[risk of]{.mark} nuclear [annihilation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However,
if both sides believed they were evenly matched and lacked a
first-strike incentive, they refrained from attacking.

However, these [[arms]{.mark} [races]{.mark}]{.underline} still had
[profoundly destabilizing moments]{.underline} as different measures
were implemented that could alter the deterrent balance between the two.
Long called this the \"Security Dilemma,\" where one party acts to
enhance its security, causing another to seek parity or advantage and
respond.95 Thus, a cycle of action-reaction meant to reinforce
deterrence can drive instability. Missile defense attempts are an
example.

**[[Missile defense]{.underline}]{.mark}** [could **[undermine
deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline} [by [nullifying]{.mark} an
[adversary\'s ability to retaliate]{.mark}, [making]{.mark} [aggression
**more likely**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [**[S]{.mark}**trategic
**[D]{.mark}**efense **[I]{.mark}**nitiative]{.underline} (SDI)
[proposed by Reagan was a real example. [Intended to buffer]{.mark} U.S.
[security]{.mark}]{.underline}, the SDI was [**[perceived]{.mark}** by
the Soviet Union [as]{.mark} an [attempt to undermine]{.mark} [mutual
deterrence]{.mark}, which resulted in an **[escalating]{.mark} [arms
race]{.mark}**]{.underline}.96 Thus, stability can be found. In an arms

[Nuclear [**deterrence** depends on]{.mark} the ability of
**[sub]{.mark}**marine**[s]{.mark}** to **hide**]{.underline}

For some years to come, [the]{.underline} vastness of the [[ocean
will]{.mark} continue to [protect]{.mark} the **[stealth]{.mark}** of
submarines]{.underline}. [[But the]{.underline}]{.mark} very
[[**prospect** of]{.mark} greater [**ocean transparency** has
implications for]{.mark}]{.underline} global
**[[security]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Concealed [submarines bearing
**ballistic missiles** provide]{.underline} the [threat of
**retaliation** against a first]{.underline} nuclear
[strike]{.underline}. What if that changes?

"We take for granted the degree to which we rely upon having a
significant portion of our forces exist in an essentially invulnerable
position," Lewis says. [Even if new **developments** did not reduce
**submarine stealth** by much]{.underline}, [[the **mere
perception**]{.underline}]{.mark} of such a reduction [[could
**undermine**]{.mark} strategic [stability]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Gottemoeller warns that "[[any **perception**]{.mark} that
**[nuclear]{.mark}**-armed **[sub]{.mark}**marine[**s** have
become]{.mark} more [**targetable** will lead to **questions**
abou]{.mark}t the **survivability of [second-strike]{.mark}**
forces]{.underline}. Consequently, countries are going to do everything
they can to counter any such vulnerability."

Experts disagree on the irreversibility of ocean transparency. Because
any technological breakthroughs will not be implemented overnight,
"nations should have ample time to develop countermeasures \[that\]
cancel out any improved detection capabilities," says Matt Korda, senior
research associate at the Federation of American Scientists, in
Washington, D.C. However, Roger Bradbury and eight colleagues at the
National Security College of the Australian National University
disagree, claiming that any technical ability to counter detection
technologies will start to decline by 2050.

Korda also points out that ocean transparency, to the extent that it
occurs, "will not affect countries equally. And that raises some
interesting questions." For example, U.S. nuclear-powered submarines are
"the quietest on the planet. They are virtually undetectable. Even if
submarines become more visible in general, this may have zero meaningful
effect on U.S. submarines' survivability."

Sylvia Mishra, a new-tech nuclear officer at the European Leadership
Network, a London-based think tank, says she is "more concerned about
the overall problem of ambiguity under the sea." Until recently, she
says, movement under the oceans was the purview of governments. Now,
though, there's a growing industry presence under the sea. For example,
companies are laying many underwater fiber-optic communication cables,
Mishra says, "which may lead to greater congestion of underwater
inspection vehicles, and the possibility for confusion."

Confusion might come from the fact that drones, unlike surface ships, do
not bear a country flag, and therefore their ownership may be unclear.
This uncertainty, coupled with the possibility that the drones could
also carry lethal payloads, increases the risk that a naval force might
view an innocuous commercial drone as hostile. "Any actions that hold
the strategic assets of adversaries at risk may produce new touch points
for conflict and exacerbate the risk of war," says Mishra.

[Given the **strategic importance** of **sub**marine
**stealth**]{.underline}, Gower asks, "[Why would any country **want**
to **detect** and **[track
sub]{.mark}**marine**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}? [It's]{.underline} only
[[something you'd do if you want to make a
**nuclear**]{.underline}]{.mark}-armed [[power
**nervous**]{.underline}]{.mark}." Even in the Cold War, when the United
States and the U.K. routinely tracked Soviet ballistic-missile
submarines, they did so only because they knew their activities would go
undetected---that is, without risking escalation. Gower postulates that
this was dangerously arrogant: "[[To]{.underline}]{.mark} actively
[[track **second-strike**]{.mark} nuclear forces
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} about [as **[escalatory]{.mark}** as you might
imagine]{.underline}."

"[All nuclear]{.underline}-armed [[states]{.mark} place a **great
[value]{.mark}** on their **[second-strike]{.mark}**
forces]{.underline}," Gottemoeller says. [If]{.underline} greater [ocean
[transparency]{.mark} produces new risks]{.underline} to their
survivability, [[**real** or **perceived**]{.underline}]{.mark}, she
says, [countries may respond]{.underline} in two ways: build up their
nuclear forces further and take new measures to protect and defend them,
[**[produc]{.mark}**ing [a new **arms race**]{.mark}]{.underline}; or
else keep the number of nuclear weapons limited and find other ways to
bolster their viability.

[**Strategic Stability** and the **Trilemma**]{.underline}

[The classic definition of **[strategic stability]{.mark}**]{.underline}
from the Cold War era was spelled out by Thomas Schelling and Morton
Halperin in their book Strategy and Arms Control. Therein the authors
[posit that a **[reduced risk]{.mark}** of war between great powers
means]{.underline} not only [[ensuring that no one has an **incentive**
to **strike first**]{.underline}]{.mark}, but also that the calculation
equation prevents risk from "shocks, alarms and perturbations."17 Their
definition, when compared to Arnold and Brodie's deterrence concept, not
only stipulates confidence that a means of answering a first strike with
a devastating response by surviving forces is guaranteed, but [a
[**second strike** capability must be accentuated]{.mark} by
a]{.underline} "**[prevent risk]{.underline}**" [equation]{.underline}.
[**Stability** against a]{.underline} contemplated [**first strike** by
itself is **not enough** to guarantee **strategic
stability**]{.underline}, particularly [in light of opportunities for
[unforeseen **tech**]{.mark}nological [advancements]{.mark} to [create
**shocks** and **perturbations**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the perceived
balance of forces.

Interestingly, Elbridge Colby took on the challenge of defining
[strategic stability for the post-Cold War era]{.underline} with
emphasis on the impact of President Obama's 2010 NPR, which [advocated a
**reduced** role for **nuclear weapons**]{.underline}, [supporting the
concept of **finite deterrence**]{.underline}. Presuming the situation
stable between Russia and the United States, Colby declared that [either
[state would see no]{.mark}]{.underline} "[need [**nor incentive** to
use **nuc**]{.mark}lear weapon**[s]{.mark}** [except to make
clear]{.mark} to [an opponent]{.mark} that he had [**crossed** a]{.mark}
most vital **[red line]{.mark}** with the probability that he would
suffer]{.underline} further---and perhaps
**[catastrophic]{.underline}**---[loss]{.underline} if he continued his
aggression."18 Furthermore, "some [uses of **[nuc]{.mark}**lear
weapon[**s** must be **valid** for]{.mark} real
**[stability]{.mark}**]{.underline} to endure. In a stable situation,
then, [**major [war]{.mark}** would [only come]{.mark} about [because
**one party**]{.mark} truly [sought it]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[not
because of **miscalc**]{.mark}ulation]{.underline}."19

It is important to note that [Colby's [definition applies to **all
nuclear**]{.mark}weapons **[states]{.mark}**]{.underline} and [not just
**Russia** and the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}. He continues:

> [strategic [stability would]{.mark}]{.underline} definitively
> [[not]{.mark} be to attempt to [break]{.mark} out of a situation of
> **[mutual vulnerability]{.mark}**]{.underline}, given such an effort's
> toxic combination of futility and dramatic escalatory impetus, but
> rather [to **signal** to an **opponent** that he had **transgressed**
> a most **vital interest**]{.underline}, [to demonstrate one's
> **resolve**]{.underline} about climbing the imperfectly controllable
> ladder of escalation, [and to **inflict pain** on the **opponent** to
> attempt to **dissuade** him from **pursuing** his course of
> **action**]{.underline}.20

The crux of [Colby's argument is the need to **control escalation**
dynamics when an adversary crosses a **red line**]{.underline} regarding
a state's vital interests. He adds, "[[the side with]{.mark} a **greater
variety** of and [more]{.mark} **tailored [options]{.mark}** [for
**limited**]{.mark} **nuclear [use]{.mark}** would be in a strong
position]{.underline} in such a struggle, since [his **threats to
strike** [would be]{.mark} both [more **credible**
and]{.mark}]{.underline} his strikes [more
**[damaging]{.mark}**]{.underline}."21

[While [Colby's argument is **applicable** to]{.mark} the **major
nuclear powers**]{.underline} (particularly [**Russia** and
**China**]{.underline}), [it applies **even more** to the [**rising
powers** and **rogues** who are]{.mark} more likely [risk-takers]{.mark}
when considering the]{.underline} aforementioned [security trilemma
and]{.underline} accompanying **[WMD]{.underline}**/asymmetric
[**tech**nologies-associated **proliferation** dynamics]{.underline}.
Furthermore, Larsen warns that wars appearing as limited to great powers
likely look more like total war to smaller states, in which case smaller
states or non-state actors with nuclear or other weapons of mass

them.22 In other words, [[it would be **sensible** to apply Colby's
logic]{.mark} responding [to]{.mark} such threats in [the **nonnuclear
realm**]{.mark} as well]{.underline}. Why not ensure escalation
dominance at the conventional level against the rising threat of new
states and non-state actors who acquire WMD and other emerging dangerous
technologies? [**[Stability]{.mark}** is then [more likely]{.mark} to be
established [with]{.mark} the **lesser nuclear** and other
**[WMD]{.mark}**]{.underline}/[**asymmetric [tech]{.mark}**nology
[powers]{.mark} acting against U.S. interests]{.underline}. When
deterrence fails, [[conventional escalation]{.mark} dominance [can
provide a **denial** mechanism to preempt against]{.mark} **nuclear**
or]{.underline} other **[[WMD threats]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} where necessary [[defeat **rogue**

Currently, [in addition to **nuclear** factors]{.underline},
[**[strategic stability]{.mark}** relations [among]{.mark}]{.underline}
the [[**great powers** are]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[characterized by
**interdependence**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[This
encompasses]{.underline}]{.mark} increasing [common

include failed states, climate change and other threats that can

[With deepening **economic** and **political

[**interdependence** on each other and the international **system** is
constantly **growing**]{.underline}.26 In this way, [[**strategic

**maintained**]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is [[not only]{.mark} because
**[mutual vulnerability]{.mark}** means]{.underline} that these [states

In 2006, two leading scholars of the nuclear era warned that the age of
mutually assured destruction (MAD) was ending. Seventeen years later,
the authors are doubling down on these claims, arguing that the outbreak
of new conventional conflicts has changed nuclear decision making,
increasing the threat of coercive nuclear escalation. In an age of new
technology, this warning is more pertinent than ever. [The **rapid
[introduction]{.mark}** [of **emerging tech**]{.mark}nologies
and]{.underline} their [**weaponization** [raises concerns
about]{.mark}]{.underline} maintaining [**[strat]{.mark}**egic
**[stab]{.mark}**ility]{.underline}.

Artificial intelligence (**[[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [[poses
a]{.mark} special [risk to]{.mark} the integrity of nuclear
command]{.underline}, [control]{.underline}, [and
communications]{.underline} (**[[NC3]{.underline}]{.mark}**). [NC3 is
necessary to ensure]{.underline} authorized employment and termination
of [operations]{.underline}, [securing against
**accidental**]{.underline} or unauthorized access resulting in the loss
of control, theft, [or]{.underline} [**unauthorized use** of **nuclear
force**]{.underline}. Observers warn that AI-powered cyberspace
operations might put these missions at risk. [[Leaders who lack
confidence in]{.underline}]{.mark} the integrity of their
**[[NC3]{.underline}]{.mark}** may not act with deliberation in a
crisis. Instead, they [[might **lash out**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

AI-integration in NC3 systems could result in potentially catastrophic
scenarios, [[raising]{.mark} the **[likelihood of nuclear
conflict]{.mark}** by [creating]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[conditions
for **first-strike**]{.mark} instability]{.underline}, [unintended
**escalation**]{.underline}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} widespread
**[[arms racing]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[Strategic Stability]{.underline}

[[**Nuclear** weapons deter **aggression**]{.mark} because
of]{.underline} the threat of **[retaliation]{.underline}**. Would-be
[aggressors think twice]{.underline} when faced with national
extinction. [**Strat**egic **stab**ility obtains]{.underline} with
[**nuclear-armed** rivals **deter** one another]{.underline}. Lasting
[[**stability** obtains when states have **no incentive** to]{.mark}
launch a **[first strike]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [when crises are
manageable]{.underline}, [[and when **arms races** do not spin out of
control]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[When two]{.underline} rival [states]{.underline} both [possess
sufficient **nuc**lear weapon**s**]{.underline}, [[no state can launch a
**pre-emptive attack**]{.mark} without]{.underline} fear of a
[**catastrophic** response]{.underline}. A
[[second-strike]{.underline}]{.mark} capability [[exists]{.mark} when a
state has the ability to **retaliate** even after **absorbing** a
**nuclear attack**]{.underline}, [directing its response
through]{.underline} surviving [NC3 systems]{.underline}. [[If]{.mark}
an aggressor surmises]{.underline} that [the [defender has **no
second-strike**]{.mark}]{.underline} capability, [the [incentive to
**strike**]{.mark} **first**]{.underline} and destroy the target [[is
greater]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[Crisis [**stability** relies on]{.mark} **mutual [incentives]{.mark}**
to de-escalate]{.underline} during crises. Crisis stability does not
seek to prevent political conflict but to avoid nuclear escalation.
During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union maintained
crisis stability despite their deep antipathy. Despite escalated
tensions, the fear of nuclear war restrained both sides during these
conflicts.

[Arms-race [**stability** emerges when]{.mark} new
**[tech]{.mark}**nologies [do not threaten]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[strategic balance]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Defenses are
**robust**]{.underline} and security is abundant under these conditions.
[But]{.underline} in other cases, [**[defensive innovations]{.mark}**
can **[make others feel less secure]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
[[emergence of new weapons systems]{.underline}]{.mark} often
[[perpetuates]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[security
dilemma]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[leading to **arms racing**]{.mark} and
**crisis instability**]{.underline}. For example, the British
development of the first dreadnought in the 1900s revolutionized naval
power, sparking an intense arms race with Germany that lasted until the
advent of World War I.

[[Emerging **tech**]{.mark}nology may cause something **similar**
today]{.underline}. [**AI** and **cyber**]{.underline} capabilities
[[can]{.underline}]{.mark} be used to [[infiltrate]{.underline}]{.mark}
and compromise [**[NC3]{.mark}** systems]{.underline},
[[disrupting]{.underline}]{.mark} a nation's [[ability to
**retaliate**]{.mark} following a **nuclear attack**]{.underline}. The
internet opens new avenues for espionage, proliferation, and information
warfare that compromise the secrecy and security of nuclear arsenals.
[Advanced [imaging technologies]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[such as]{.mark}
high-resolution **[satellite]{.mark} imagery**]{.underline},
[can]{.underline} potentially [[expose]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[location of hidden]{.mark} **nuclear
[facilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [making them [vulnerable to]{.mark}
**preemptive [strikes]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} combination of new technologies [[threatens
to unravel]{.mark} decades of **[nuclear
stability]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Artificial Intelligence and NC3

AI is particularly concerning. Its appeal is obvious: artificial
intelligence can source massive amounts of data across networks, process
that data, and output recommendations to human operators -- or execute
tasks independently. AI integration increases the speed of data
analysis, serving as a useful tool in conventional military scenarios.
Integrating AI capabilities into NC3 systems would also allow the U.S.
to detect and respond to nuclear attacks more efficiently. But speedy
decision-making may work against stability, especially during crises
that already compress the window for deliberation.

[**AI**-enabled **NC3**]{.underline} systems [could undermine
**first-strike stability**]{.underline}. [AI]{.underline} applications
that allow autonomous decision-making [increases
**uncertainty**]{.underline} in evaluating a potential threat or
executing a first-strike. AI-[[integration introduces
**vulnerabilities**]{.mark} that adversaries can
manipulate]{.underline}. In a worst-case scenario, [an [adversary could
disrupt]{.mark}]{.underline} NC3 [system's [abilities to
**communicate**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [provide **early
warnings**]{.underline}, [[or]{.mark} execute a
**[second-strike]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [[risks]{.mark} inherent to
the]{.underline} nature and [limitations of AI]{.underline} technology
[can [increase]{.mark}]{.underline} the [risk of
**[miscalc]{.mark}**ulation]{.underline}.

[AI integration can lead to]{.underline} accidental
**[escalation]{.underline}**. AI-enabled NC3 tools drastically shorten
decision-making time. [Automation **quickens** the pace of
**warfare**]{.underline}, as machines execute complicated tasks in
seconds. [[Fear of]{.mark} quickly [losing]{.mark} can [create]{.mark}
incentives for **[rapid responses]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[[increasing]{.underline}]{.mark} the chances of
[**[miscalc]{.mark}**ulation]{.underline}. [Reliance on AI]{.underline}
for nuclear decision-making during a crisis [might]{.underline}
inadvertently [compromise]{.underline} states' [ability to **control
escalation**]{.underline}.

The [[asymmetric acquisition]{.underline}]{.mark} of cutting-edge AI
technology [[creates]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[conditions for]{.mark} a
**[destabilizing arms race]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In response to
unmatched AI innovation, [adversaries]{.underline} will [enter the race
to acquire similar **tech**nology]{.underline} to level the playing
field quickly. [Other]{.underline} nuclear-armed [states
cling]{.underline} more tightly [to their arsenals to increase
security]{.underline}. Technologically [disadvantaged
[states]{.mark}]{.underline} may seek to [[acquire **nuc**]{.mark}lear
weapon**[s]{.mark}** to **bolster deterrence**]{.underline}.
[These]{.underline} unstable [[conditions]{.underline}]{.mark} can
[**[increase]{.mark} tension** and]{.underline} the [[likelihood of
**conflict**]{.underline}]{.mark} between competing states.

Imagine finding yourself on a serene seashore, only to realize that a
catastrophic tsunami is imminent. However, this is no ordinary tsunami;
this one is radioactive. In January 2023, the Russian news agency TASS
[reported](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/navy-ships/a42537023/russia-poseidon-torpedo/)
that [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} had [[produced]{.underline}]{.mark}
the first set of
**[[nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark}**-**[[powered]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
very **[[long range]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[nuclear-armed]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[torpedoes]{.underline}]{.mark} known as
"[[Poseidon]{.underline}]{.mark}." Strategic experts are warning that
the Poseidon torpedo would have the potential to devastate a coastal
city, cause radioactive floods, and result in millions of deaths. Over
the past few years, tabloid news outlets [have
painted](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11862777/Russia-nuclear-war-Experts-say-Putins-Poseidon-nuke-kill-millions.html)
a hauntingly vivid picture of a towering, 1,000-foot-tall radioactive
tsunami violently crashing onto British shores, pulverizing everything
in its path, and transforming whole cities into barren, lifeless lands.
Is Poseidon even real? In ancient Greek mythology, Poseidon was revered
as the god of the oceans, protector of sailors and those who worked or
traveled at sea. In the current context, "Poseidon" takes on a different
meaning, with a destructive weapon capable of causing catastrophic
events. Russia's Poseidon---also known in the United States as Kanyon,
Ocean Multipurpose System, and Status-6---was first revealed by the
Russian Navy in 2015 and reportedly
[tested](https://thediplomat.com/2016/12/russia-tests-nuclear-capable-underwater-drone/)
for the first time in November 2016. The torpedo---a nuclear-powered
underwater drone equipped with nuclear weapons---is designed to be
launched from submarines. The first Poseidon is expected to be deployed
by 2027. There is buzz that this new weapon is poised to shake the
landscape of modern warfare. And this may owe less to its borrowed name
than to some unmatched features---at least on paper. Powered by a
compact nuclear reactor, it is believed the Poseidon could [[travel
at]{.underline}]{.mark} [**[[unprecedented
speed]{.underline}]{.mark}**s](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2015/11/18/russias-perhaps-not-real-super-torpedo/)
of 100 knots (185 kilometers per hour), have a range of approximately
10,000 kilometers, and operate at depths of up to 1,000 meters. Designed
to evade detection by acoustic tracking devices and other traps, the
Poseidon has a diameter of approximately 1.6 to two meters. Particularly
riveting is the torpedo's devastating payload: a nuclear warhead with a
[likely
yield](https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2020/07/25/the_barbarians_in_the_bay_russias_nuclear_armed_drone_submarine_115493.html)
of at least several megatons (with early reports suggesting it could
yield up to 100 megatons). For comparison, Russia's Tsar Bomba---the
most powerful nuclear weapon ever tested---had an estimated blast yield
of about 50 megatons. While some reports
[claim](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2021/01/19/russias-dirty-bomb-robo-sub-is-grotesque-but-moscows-building-a-base-for-it-anyway/)
that Russia's Poseidon may exist only as a propaganda scheme, experts
generally agree that the system is "[very
real](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/05/europe/russia-arctic-nato-military-intl-cmd/index.html)"
and has received significant resources from the Russian armed forces,
although many details remain unknown.
[Intelligence](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/05/europe/russia-arctic-nato-military-intl-cmd/index.html)
[reports](https://news.usni.org/2021/08/31/new-satellite-images-hint-how-russian-navy-could-use-massive-nuclear-torpedos)
have suggested that Poseidon has undergone many trials, evidenced by the
fact that some submarines have been modified and some are being
specially built to accommodate for the larger and heavier Poseidon. For
instance, the [Sarov](http://www.hisutton.com/Status-6_KANYON.html)
submarine [is
believed](http://www.hisutton.com/SAROV-Class_Submarine.html) to have
been modified to test Poseidon prototypes. According to TASS, the
Russian Navy intends to purchase at least [30 Poseidon
torpedoes](https://thediplomat.com/2019/01/russia-to-deploy-over-30-nuclear-capable-poseidon-underwater-drones/)
and deploy them on four submarines. Prototype of Russia's Poseidon
nuclear-powered/nuclear-armed torpedo next to the silhouette of a human
being and other Russian underwater weaponry. (Image courtesy of HI
Sutton/Covert Shores -- hisutton.com) Poseidon's origin and roles. The
idea of torpedoes fitted with a nuclear warhead was first conceived in
the 1950s, when the Soviet Union began two separate programs to develop
submarine-launched nuclear torpedoes---the T-5 and the T-15. These
programs were part of a broader strategy to expand the Soviet Union's
nuclear capabilities and gain an edge in a nuclear crisis. In October
1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, a Soviet submarine armed with a
T-5 nuclear- tipped torpedo [came
close](https://www.usni.org/magazines/naval-history-magazine/2022/october/submarines-october)
to launching it against US forces because its commander, Valentin
Savitsky, believed that a US-Soviet Union war had already started. It is
only because the submarine's deputy commander, [Vasili
Arkhipov](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/russia-programs/2022-10-03/soviet-submarines-nuclear-torpedoes-cuban-missile-crisis),
convinced other top officers that [[launching]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[torpedo]{.underline}]{.mark} would be a **[[fatal
mistake]{.underline}]{.mark}** that a potential **[[nuclear
catastrophe]{.underline}]{.mark}** was prevented. The Poseidon torpedo,
however, will have no human
[onboard](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.05291.pdf) to make critical
decisions after it has been launched. It will be [[controlled
through]{.underline}]{.mark} a combination of [[remote
comm]{.underline}]{.mark}unications [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} onboard
[[automation]{.underline}]{.mark}. These forms of guidance may [[lead
to]{.underline}]{.mark} problems that include
**[[hacking]{.underline}]{.mark}** by third parties, **[[loss of
control]{.underline}]{.mark}** because of technical malfunctions, and
**[[environment]{.underline}]{.mark}**ally caused
**[[accidents]{.underline}]{.mark}** that may lead to wrong signaling
and thus inadvertent escalation. The Poseidon can be viewed as an
evolution in Russia's nuclear deterrence strategy. Russia currently
possesses the [Dead
Hand](https://www.military.com/history/russias-dead-hand-soviet-built-nuclear-doomsday-device.html),
an automated nuclear weapons command system also known as the Perimeter.
Established during the Cold War, the Perimeter was created to ensure
that, in a crisis, the Soviet Union could respond to a nuclear first
strike, even if Russia's armed forces were destroyed and all its
leadership was eliminated. But with the technological advances of US
ballistic missile defense systems, the Russian Perimeter system, which
concerns intercontinental ballistic missiles only, has lost its
preeminence. Russian authorities describe the Poseidon torpedo as a
multi-purpose system, suggesting that it could serve several roles. It
is widely speculated that the Poseidon may have been [[developed
as]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[[reaction]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} advances in [[US ballistic missile defense
capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}. In March 2018, Russian President
Putin [stated](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/56957) that
Poseidon and other advanced weapons were developed because of the demise
of the 1972 US-Soviet Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which Putin said
was "the cornerstone of the international security system." After the
United States pulled out of the treaty in 2002 to build its new national
missile defense system, Russia started working on improving their
military equipment and weapons to maintain a strong nuclear deterrent
capability against US assets. Besides being touted as a weapon that can
circumvent US ballistic missile defenses for use
[against](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05291) aircraft carrier groups and
coastal targets, Poseidon also reflects Russia's larger nuclear strategy
and doctrine. After the Cold War ended, the United States shifted its
focus to de-emphasizing the role of nuclear weapons in its security
strategy. But Russia continued to greatly rely on nuclear weapons and
even [adopted](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/nuke/R45861.pdf) a nuclear
doctrine of "escalate to de-escalate," which consists of using nuclear
coercion and messaging tactics to achieve strategic goals. The
development and deployment of new nuclear weapons like the Poseidon are
considered to contribute to Russia's broader strategy. The
Belgorod---Russia's largest submarine---reportedly will be capable of
carrying up to six Poseidon torpedoes. A second Poseidon-capable
submarine---the Khabarovsk---reportedly is under development. (Image:
Russian Navy) Effect on strategic stability. Advances in artificial
intelligence and the use of autonomous platforms for nuclear delivery
such as unmanned aerial vehicles, unmanned underwater vehicles, and
hypersonic glide vehicles have [raised
concerns](https://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep25355.10) over potential
negative impacts on strategic stability. Weaker nuclear-armed countries
would remain unable to keep up with progress in AI technologies, which
also pose new risks by reducing the direct human control over nuclear
weapons use. In this context, the deployment by Russia of its
nuclear-capable, autonomous Poseidon torpedo could be seen to also
threatening strategic stability. However, many experts and US
officials---including former US Defense Secretary James Mattis---believe
that the addition of the Poseidon torpedo to Russia's nuclear arsenal
[would not
alter](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/1463160/mattis-sees-no-change-in-russian-military-capability-in-light-of-putins-speech/)
the existing [strategic nuclear
balance](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Russias-Exotic-Nuclear-Weapons.pdf)
with the United States because Russia already possesses the capability
to launch nuclear-armed missiles at US cities. The introduction of
Poseidon would not significantly increase the existing threat and, even
if used, its impact would be limited to coastal areas. Instead, many see
Poseidon primarily as a [psychological
weapon](https://thebarentsobserver.com/en/security/2023/01/poseidon-nuclear-torpedo-tested-arctic-waters-primarily-psychological-weapon-expert)
intended for nuclear signaling rather than for its actual use. Some
[even
speculate](https://thediplomat.com/2018/07/russia-begins-sea-trials-of-nuclear-capable-poseidon-underwater-prone/)
that the Poseidon will remain at the prototype stage and serve mainly
political objectives, such as renewed talks with the United States on
ballistic missile defense systems. The weapon's primary intent may be in
the uncertainty, speculation, and fear it can provoke. How to respond?
Automated weapons like Poseidon, especially if controlled by artificial
intelligence, undoubtedly add complexity to decision-making in a crisis.
It effectively transforms AI into an active participant during times of
strategic adversity. This has sparked a heated debate on whether these
systems should be fully automated or not, as automation brings
significant risks of misjudging the intentions of an opponent. To better
understand the challenges posed by unmanned automated nuclear vehicles
like Poseidon, further research is imperative, which requires gathering
more information about the weapon itself. While ensuring that research
in automation only aims to reduce any risks associated with accidents or
inadvertent use, it is equally important for countries to continue
engaging in arms control and risk reduction talks whenever possible.
Such dialogues may play a crucial role in providing insight into each
other's nuclear forces, helping to alleviate uncertainties about
possible new weapon systems, including the Poseidon.

#### Russian coercion shifted nuclear balance by diminishing US deterrence

**Schneider '25** \["How Russian Coercion Diminished Deterrence and
Shifted the Nuclear Balance",
https://www.hudson.org/arms-control-nonproliferation/how-russian-coercion-diminished-deterrence-shifted-nuclear-balance-william-schneider\]

For a recent example of the rapidity of change in the international
security environment, one should look to [the United States' most recent
Nuclear Posture Review (**NPR**]{.underline}). Though it was released in
2022, [nearly all its policy aims and expectations are already out of
date]{.underline}. With Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair General Dan Caine
warning last week that he does not believe Russia will stop at Ukraine,
and with Russian President [Vladimir Putin boasting that his country is
the "highest of all nuclear powers," Washington needs to update its
understanding of the **new nuclear balance.**]{.underline}

In its NPR, the Biden administration sought to place "[renewed emphasis
on arms control \[and\] nuclear non-proliferation]{.underline}." Doing
so[, it believed, would enable the president to "pursue opportunities to
reduce the role of nuclear weapons globally, enhance **strategic
stability** with]{.underline} the \[People's Republic of China\] and
[Russia]{.underline}, and reduce the risks of war or escalation during
war."

But [nuclear weapons are now central to]{.underline} the diplomatic
aspirations of four nuclear-armed (or near-nuclear-armed) **[US
adversaries]{.underline}**---China, [Russia]{.underline}, Iran, and
North Korea. These increasingly aligned states have signed a series of
diplomatic, intelligence, defense-industrial, logistics, and military
agreements. Additionally, [arms control and nuclear nonproliferation
frameworks constructed during the Cold War have **ceased** to
meaningfully constrain Russian nuclear weapons programs]{.underline}.
[Russia has withdrawn from the Comprehensive Test **Ban Treaty,** which
suggests that it will resume nuclear testing and will not extend New
**START**]{.underline} (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty). Moreover,
emerging [doubts about]{.underline} the [US commitment to global
**nuclear deterrence** are emboldening Moscow's nuclear weapons
development and deployment aspirations]{.underline}. And Russia's 2022
full-scale invasion of Ukraine signaled a definitive end to the accords
concerning Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity: the 1994
Budapest Memorandum and the 2014 and 2015 Minsk agreements.

Most fundamentally, [US policy choices since Russia's invasion have
given US allies and adversaries alike reason to believe that nuclear
threats are an effective means of deterring the US.]{.underline} The
widespread recognition that the US could be deterred from taking actions
otherwise in its interest [set in motion a sequence of Russian
initiatives that have adversely affected the **credibility** of US
nuclear deterrence]{.underline} and nuclear nonproliferation aims more
broadly.

Russia's Deployment of Nuclear Threats to Coerce the US

The [Biden administration's]{.underline} cumulative [policy choices
regarding Ukraine have **diminished** the credibility of the US nuclear
deterrent]{.underline} and encouraged several nations' nuclear
aspirations. Before the conflict began, the US had already limited its
policy options. In December [2021]{.underline} President Joe [Biden
removed any fear President Putin might have had that the US military
would intervene in Ukraine]{.underline}, announcing the US [would
respond only by imposing economic sanctions.]{.underline} Recalling
American forces' shambolic retreat from Afghanistan less than a year
earlier, the administration also confirmed that it had plans to evacuate
US citizens from Ukraine in the event of an invasion, further affirming
Washington's intention to distance itself from the conflict.

[Russian manipulation of **coercive** nuclear **threats** to constrain
US policy choices.]{.underline} The Center for Strategic and
International Studies documented that [Moscow threatened nuclear use
more than 200 times from 2022--23]{.underline} in its survey Nuclear
Signaling During the War in Ukraine. The United Kingdom House of Commons
also published a research briefing in December 2024 summarizing Russia's
coercive nuclear threats (see appendix). [President Biden viewed
Russia's nuclear threats as credible and perceived the risk to be
apocalyptic.]{.underline}

In October 2022 President [Biden]{.underline} indicated that President
Putin was "not joking" about his readiness to use nuclear weapons,
[positing that the risk of a nuclear "Armageddon" was at its highest
level since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis]{.underline}. The president
also rejected Poland's offer to facilitate the transfer of Soviet-era
aircraft to Ukraine, stating that doing so meant "World War III."

The consequences of the administration's decisions are likely to be
enduring. Several allied nonnuclear states are now considering the
acquisition of nuclear weapons. In addition, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and European Union are reviewing proposals to establish a
European nuclear deterrent as a substitute for the US nuclear umbrella.

Finally, Russia's repeated breach of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty's clause against the manipulation of nuclear threats against a
nonnuclear state has changed nonnuclear states' calculus on whether to
acquire nuclear weapons. Acquiring nuclear weapons now appears to be the
only way for nonnuclear states to deter attacks---even nonnuclear
ones---by nuclear states.

Russia's Lowering of the Threshold for Nuclear Use

[Russia successfully demonstrated that its nuclear **threats** could
**deter** the US from providing modern defensive capabilities to
**Ukraine**.]{.underline} To exploit this, [Moscow changed its policy on
nuclear use]{.underline} in its November 2024 declaration "Fundamentals
of State Policy of the Russian Federation on Nuclear Deterrence."

The Kremlin's [new policy holds at risk the basis for **nuclear
stability** between the US and Russia. It states that Russia may use
nuclear weapons in a conventional conflict that "creates a **critical
threat** to \[Russia's and Belarus's\] sovereignty and (or) territorial
integrity]{.underline}."

In 2022 the Kremlin formally annexed four Ukrainian oblasts that Russia
had at least partially captured in its 2014 and 2022 invasions: Donetsk,
Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia. It also formally annexed Crimea,
although it had completed its conquest of the region in 2014. Residents
in the occupied regions became Russian citizens and were obliged to
carry Russian passports. Therefore, under the 2024 policy, Russia could
employ nuclear weapons in response to Ukraine's effort to recover its
rightful territory, as doing so could pose "a critical threat" to
Russia's "territorial integrity."

Russia's Development, Production, and Deployment of Advanced and Novel
Nuclear Weapons and Delivery Systems

[Russia's recent nuclear weapons policy has contravened the US
commitment to **reducing** the role of nuclear **weapons** in
international affairs. Russia's foreign policy has instead relied on
broadening the threat of nuclear use.]{.underline}

[Russia's treaty-based **collaboration** with China, Iran, and North
Korea, particularly in the defense industrial realm, has helped Moscow
realize its expanded nuclear weapons aspirations.]{.underline} North
Korea produces an advanced version of Russia's Iskander ballistic
missile, as well as over half the munitions Russia uses in Ukraine.
Russia is assisting China to increase Beijing's production of plutonium
for its rapidly increasing theater and strategic nuclear forces. China,
Iran, and Russia have built an extensive transportation network (the
International North--South Corridor) from Moscow through the Caspian Sea
to Iran to evade sanctions intended to limit their access to advanced
military technology.

In [2022 Russia deployed nuclear weapons outside its own borders for the
first time, starting with the air-launched hypersonic Kinzhal missile.
The Kremlin has deployed dozens more nuclear weapons to
Belarus]{.underline} since then. In 2024 Belarus agreed to accept the
deployment of Russia's newest ballistic missile, theOreshnik. This
hypersonic missile, derived from Russia's RS-26 intercontinental
ballistic missile (ICBM), has a range of around 1,800--3,400 miles
(3,000--5,500 kilometers), which would allow it to target all of Europe
and the Middle East.

In conclusion, [[strat]{.underline}]{.mark}egic
[[stab]{.underline}]{.mark}ility is being
**[[undermined]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the contemporary world.

[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} [[end]{.underline}]{.mark} the war in

[[weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} might **[[threaten]{.underline}]{.mark}**
their [[second-strike capabiliti]{.underline}]{.mark}es all undermine
strategic stability. [[Tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nological
[[advanc]{.underline}]{.mark}es in hypersonic weapons, AI, counter-space
capabilities, and cyber **[[add to]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[uncertainti]{.underline}]{.mark}**es as these weapons too threaten
warning systems and second-strike forces. Because China's nuclear plans
are opaque, and the United States and Russia will no longer be bound to
declare the status of their forces after New START expires, transparency
is not likely to improve. North Korea's continued development of
warheads and missiles adds to the sense of threat.

Due to the complexities of the three-body problem, analysts need to
rethink the assumptions and theories regarding nuclear conflict
developed during the Cold War. A tripolar nuclear "balance" is much more
complex than the Cold War's bipolar balance. While fundamental concepts
like deterrence are sound, we need to rethink the way these concepts
will be applied with three major nuclear powers instead of two. The
United States also needs to make careful judgments on the extent to
which China and Russia might cooperate more closely in the military
sphere.

As a result of the undermining of strategic stability, the
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[faces]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[difficult
choice]{.underline}]{.mark}**s. During the Obama administration the US
sought to minimize the role of nuclear weapons in American defense
strategy and seek the elimination of this category of weapons at some
point in the future. Today Washington needs to seriously address whether
the US needs additional nuclear weapons, even as it struggles to upgrade
to the Sentinel. The United States must also wrestle with the question
of whether US forces need additional types of tactical weapons to deter
Russia and China. As we have seen, the Trump and Biden administrations
have differed on this point. Washington must also seek to assure
regional allies that the American nuclear umbrella is still credible is
spite of worsening military balances. This may involve the difficult
decision to again forward deploy nuclear weapons to add to the gravity
bombs already in Europe. Finally, the preceding factors all complicate
the prospects for future arms control. Our best hope is to focus on
achievable goals such as increasing transparency and foregoing the
development of weapons systems that are particularly destabilizing.
These types of agreements may provide a small beginning toward greater
steps that might better enhance stability.

#### Strategic stability is [low now]{.underline}\-\--Ukraine, arms control and INF violations, Trump, and China.

The way forward is difficult and complex. Here are just some of the
**[[hard challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}** ahead, some of which are
long-standing problems, while other more recent developments pose new
challenges [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[strategic

[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}'s international
**[[aggression]{.underline}]{.mark}**---both [[in

major obstacles.

Alignment with U.S. allies, particularly NATO allies and partners, is
vital to meeting U.S. SSD objectives. A U.S.-Russia conflict would
directly impact regional security, and European allies have generally
been strong supporters of effective arms control and confidence-building
measures that hold Russia accountable and reduce the risk of nuclear
conflict.  In addition, Russia's large [[stockpile
of]{.underline}]{.mark} non-strategic **[[nuclear
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}** and its new nuclear ground-launched
nuclear cruise missile deployed in violation of the
now-[[defunct]{.underline}]{.mark} Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces
(**[[INF Treaty]{.underline}]{.mark}**) threaten NATO allies in Europe. 
Further, on Dec. 10, [Ryabkov
noted](https://tass.com/defense/1374031) that, for Russia, one set of
"actions with strategic effects" that should be on the SSD's agenda is,
in TASS's translation, "security guarantees for Russia through the
non-advancement of NATO to the east."

The [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} Administration's
[[withdraw]{.underline}]{.mark}al from the [[Open
Skies]{.underline}]{.mark} and Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
treaties further **[[politicized]{.underline}]{.mark}** and complicated
prospects for **[nuclear]{.underline}** **[[arms
control]{.underline}]{.mark}**.2 The decisions have exacerbated the
difficult task of achieving a two-thirds majority in the Senate
(required for bilateral treaties) and nuclear arms control as an
important national security tool has lost strong bipartisan champions.

The U.S. Senate has made clear it expects arms control progress to
include weapons outside the scope of New START, including
Russia's [non-strategic nuclear
weapons](https://armscontrolcenter.org/u-s-nonstrategic-nuclear-weapons/).
Further, [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} is
[[developing]{.underline}]{.mark} and deploying [novel nuclear
systems](https://media.nti.org/documents/NTI-Hruby_FINAL.PDF). These
include new heavy [[ICBMs]{.underline}]{.mark}, long-range
[[hypersonic]{.underline}]{.mark} nuclear weapons, and development of
systems that would not be constrained by New START limits such as
nuclear cruise missiles and an [[undersea torpedo]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}'s significant increase of its number of
[[nuc]{.underline}]{.mark}lear weapon[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[complicates]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[U.S.-Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**n [[strategic
stability]{.underline}]{.mark}. As revealed
in [open-source](https://fas.org/blogs/security/2021/07/china-is-building-a-second-nuclear-missile-silo-field/) [analysis
and
imagery](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/02/world/asia/china-missile-silos.html),
China is pursuing a rapid acceleration and increase in its number of
nuclear weapon silos, in addition to investing in more survivable
nuclear platforms, including [mobile
ICBMs](https://thebulletin.org/premium/2021-11/nuclear-notebook-chinese-nuclear-forces-2021/) and [ballistic
missile
submarines](https://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/china-submarine-capabilities/).

U.S. missile defense remains a key concern for Russia due to the
perceived impact on strategic stability and remains a politically
difficult issue in the United States. Missile defense, particularly any
future constraints, has long been a politically complex issue even as
the New START preamble recognized the interrelationship between
offensive and defensive forces.

WASHINGTON --- The U.S. [[Navy completed]{.mark} its first [deployment
of **four unmanned ships**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline} [which spent **five
months** in the Pacific]{.underline} testing concepts for how to
integrate their capabilities into crewed fleet operations.

The [**unmanned surface vessels**]{.underline} --- Sea Hunter, Sea Hawk,
Mariner and Ranger --- [departed]{.underline} Southern California on
Aug. 7 [and returned]{.underline} Jan. 15. The Sea Hunter and Sea Hawk
originate from a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency effort; the
other two come from the Strategic Capabilities Office's Overlord
program.

During that five-month period, the four prototypes sailed a combined
46,651 nautical miles and visited ports in Japan and Australia. They
also each operated for as much as 50 days at sea at a time "almost
exclusively" in autonomous mode, Cmdr. Jeremiah Daley, the head of
Unmanned Surface Vessel Division One, told reporters in a Tuesday call.

Daley said the deployment, overseen by U.S. Pacific Fleet, was meant to
put the unmanned ships in a forward-deployed environment --- with real
sailors and Marines aboard operational ships --- and test the existing
concepts of operations, crewing assumptions, predicted maintenance needs
and more.

On December 18, 2024, the Russian Strategic Missile Forces
([[SMF]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[completed]{.mark} the [re-equipment
of]{.mark}]{.underline} a division with the [Avangard
**[hypersonic]{.mark}** glide vehicle[s]{.mark}]{.underline}, further
enhancing Russia\'s nuclear deterrent and reinforcing the growing
importance of hypersonic technologies in its defense strategy. [This
deployment]{.underline}, taking place in the Orenburg region near the
Russian-Kazakh border, [[marks a]{.mark}nother [**milestone** in]{.mark}
the operational expansion of one of Russia\'s **[most advanced weapons
systems]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The Avangard hypersonic missile was first introduced to the Russian
military in December 2019 with the 13th Red Banner Rocket Division, and
by 2021, this unit had achieved full operational capability. A second
unit went on combat alert by mid-2022, and now, the Orenburg division
has joined the ranks, solidifying the Avangard's role in Russia\'s
nuclear strike capabilities.

The Avangard is [a [**cutting-edge** hypersonic]{.mark} glide
vehicle]{.underline} (HGV) designed to be launched atop a ballistic
missile. It [[represents a **major leap forward** in]{.mark} Russia's
[ability to **penetrate** missile defense]{.mark} systems and **strike
high-value targets** with immense speed and precision]{.underline}. One
of the most remarkable aspects of the Avangard is its ability to travel
at speeds exceeding Mach 20 --- roughly 6.28 km per second --- after
being boosted into suborbital flight. These speeds place the Avangard in
a category of its own, far beyond the capabilities of traditional ICBMs.
The glide vehicle's combination of speed and maneuverability during its
descent allows it to unpredictably alter its flight path, making it
virtually impossible for current missile defense systems to intercept.

\[\[PARAGRAPH BREAKS CONDENSED\]\]

In terms of technical specifications, the Avangard boasts a range of
over 6,000 km, with a weight of approximately 2,000 kg. The vehicle can
carry both nuclear and conventional payloads, with the nuclear warhead
reportedly capable of yielding more than 2 megatons of TNT equivalent
--- a staggering amount of destructive power. This versatility allows
the Avangard to be employed in a variety of strategic contexts, from
high-yield nuclear strikes to more conventional targets requiring
precision. As a boost-glide weapon, the Avangard is carried to its
suborbital apogee by a ballistic missile. Currently, this is the SS-19
\"Stiletto\" (UR-100NUTTH), though plans are in place to transition to
the more powerful RS-28 \"Sarmat\" ICBM in the future. The RS-28
\"Sarmat\" will replace the SS-19 as the Avangard's primary delivery
system, providing increased range, payload capacity, and overall
capability. Although Russia initially planned to mount the Avangard on
the road-mobile RS-26 \"Rubezh\" (SS-X-31), financial constraints led to
the adoption of the more advanced R-28 \"Sarmat\" for deployment. The
R-28 "Sarmat" will provide greater flexibility and survivability for the
Avangard in both mobile and silo-based configurations. Once boosted to
its apogee at around 100 km in altitude, the Avangard separates from its
rocket carrier and begins its glide towards its target. This separation
occurs in the vacuum of space, allowing the glide vehicle to re-enter
the atmosphere and continue its descent with atmospheric speeds
exceeding Mach 20. During this phase, the Avangard remains highly
maneuverable, using its aerodynamic features to shift its trajectory and
evade interception. As Russia's President Vladimir Putin revealed in a
2018 speech, the Avangard's ability to maneuver at hypersonic speeds
gives it an unpredictable flight path, making it especially difficult
for missile defense systems to track and engage during its descent.
Though no publicly available images of the Avangard exist, reports
suggest that it likely features a short, wedge-shaped design or possibly
a shuttle-like configuration with small stabilizer wings. The HGV itself
likely does not rely on any propulsion system after separation from its
carrier missile, instead using gravity and aerodynamic forces to
maintain its speed and altitude. This design minimizes the complexity of
the system and ensures that the vehicle remains as fast and efficient as
possible while still retaining the ability to maneuver in flight.

\[\[PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUMED\]\]

The [operational capabilities]{.underline} of the Avangard [present
**significant challenges** for missile defense systems]{.underline},
particularly those developed by NATO and the United States. The
vehicle's combination of [high speed, maneuverability, and range makes
it an **effective counter** to current missile defense
technologi]{.underline}es, which are designed to intercept traditional
ballistic missiles that follow predictable, high-arc trajectories.
Hypersonic glide vehicles like the Avangard, with their unpredictable
flight paths and speeds, complicate attempts to intercept or destroy
them before they reach their targets.

The threat posed by the Avangard is serious for the United States and
Europe. The glide vehicle's ability to carry up to a 2-megaton nuclear
warhead provides Russia with a highly effective means of delivering
devastating strikes to multiple targets simultaneously, potentially
overwhelming missile defense systems. Each large Russian
intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) can carry up to 12 Avangard
warheads, allowing for a strike on 12 separate locations, all with the
potential for thermonuclear destruction. This significantly enhances
Russia's strategic capabilities and raises the stakes in the nuclear
arms race.

Furthermore, [the deployment]{.underline} of such advanced weapons
systems by Russia [**[increases]{.mark} the [pressure]{.mark}**
[on]{.mark} NATO and [the U.S.]{.mark} to develop countermeasures that
can **neutralize hypersonic threats**]{.underline}. While current
missile defense systems can intercept traditional ICBMs, they are less
equipped to deal with the unpredictability and extreme speed of
hypersonic glide vehicles. [This [tech]{.mark}nological [gap presents
a]{.mark} **potential [vulnerability]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[particularly if [Russia **continues** to expand]{.mark} its **arsenal
of hypersonic weapons**, [**forcing** the West to accelerate]{.mark} its
own research [into **counter-hypersonic
tech**]{.mark}**nologies**]{.underline}.

submarine detection, brain-computer interfaces for improving solders'

warfare**."]{.underline}

Here's a portion of what DoD says about China's plans for those
technologies.

"[Artificial Intelligence]{.underline}. The [PRC is
**[prioritizing]{.mark} the [development of AI]{.mark}**-enabled
capabilities because of its belief that **AI** is leading to the next
revolution in **military affairs**]{.underline}. To actualize the level
of AI integration that the PLA is envisioning, Beijing recognizes the
need to leverage developments from across its commercial and academic
sectors. By 2030, the PLA expects to [[field]{.mark} a range of
'**[algorithmic warfare]{.mark}**']{.underline} and 'network-centric
warfare' capabilities operating at different levels of human-machine
integration. CCP leaders believe AI and machine learning will [enhance
information, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities and enable a
range of new defense applications,]{.underline} [including
[**autonomous** and **precision-strike** weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"The PRC is [[invested in **autonomous vehicles**]{.mark}, predictive
maintenance and logistics, and automated target
recognition]{.underline}. [The PLAN is [interested in
**u**]{.mark}**nmanned [u]{.mark}nderwater
[v]{.mark}ehicle[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}, similar to the PRC's
commercial unmanned boats. The PLA plans to use AI and machine learning
to enhance missile sensors, which may make those missiles more accurate.
Major General Hu Xiaofeng, a PLA National Defense University (NDU)
professor, recommended using [generative AI software for **wargames**
and **training operations**]{.underline}. The PLA and other defense
organizations have hosted AI competitions and used public purchasing
platforms to improve military access to civilian AI research and
capabilities in areas such as [AI-enabled unmanned vehicles, image and
object recognition, and intelligent decision support]{.underline}.

"**[Quantum]{.underline}**. The [PRC defense industry and universities
are [developing **quantum**]{.mark} **imaging**, **navigation**, and
**radar applications** to enhance intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance (**ISR**) **capabilities**]{.underline}, including
position, navigation, and timing (PNT). PLA leaders view quantum sensing
capabilities as tools to improve submarine detection. Judging from the
build out of the PRC's quantum communication infrastructure, the
[PLA]{.underline} may [**[leverage]{.mark}** integrated quantum networks
and **quantum [key distribution]{.mark}** [to reinforce]{.mark} command,
control, and communications [systems]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"**[[Biotech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}**. Biotechnology is
[[a]{.mark}nother [**core component** of]{.mark} the [PRC's
**modernization objectives**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [driving commercial
and military innovation throughout the bioeconomy]{.underline}. The
PRC's 14th FYP for Bioeconomy Development [[identifies **DNA
sequencing**]{.mark}, **[gene editing]{.mark}**, and **synthetic
biology** as examples of cutting-edge biotechnology]{.underline}. The
PLA's medical institutions have emerged as major centers for research in
gene editing and other new frontiers of biotechnology. In 2016, the PRC
instituted the China Brain Project (2016--2030) to understand cognitive
functions and neural pathways.The project focuses on R&D of various
dual-use technologies, including brain-computer interfaces (BCI), an
emerging technology which enables humans and computers to exchange
information through devices implanted in the brain or placed on the
skull. Noninvasive BCI devices are available for a variety of commercial
applications, including remote control of devices and emotion detection.
PLA [scientists]{.underline} have investigated a variety of military
applications of brain research, such as improved mental agility,
mobility, physical safety, and situational awareness of combatants. The
PLA is [[exploring]{.mark} a range of '**[neurocognitive

[In the **[military]{.mark}**]{.underline}, concerns over the

AI can provide those advantages without an associated risk, which is
often harder than it seems. For example, adding AI to large-scale
military training simulations and wargames seems like a perfect
application for the technology, but experts warn that doing so comes
with quite a few potential dangers.

For now, the [[military is]{.underline}]{.mark} cautiously [[**moving
forward** with]{.mark} **AI [integrations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But
there are a few areas where these efforts, even if they are far from the
frontlines, are starting to prove their value.

\[\[PARAGRAPH BREAKS CONDENSED\]\]

Aiming true with an AI assist While large scale wargaming against AI
opponents is still being worked out, the Human Performance Training
Center at Fort Carson, Colorado is already using the technology to help
individual soldiers become more proficient with their shooting,
battlefield awareness and decision making. According to the Army,
members of the 10th Special Forces Airborne Group --- Green Berets ---
recently completed a training course at the facility where AI was used
to provide an increasing level of challenge based on each soldier's
preceding performance. Previously, the training at Fort Carson was done
with the Army's legacy Engagement Skills Trainer program, which displays
various videos on a large screen and then records a trainee's actions
using special weapons that fire lasers at targets. The training has been
in use for years and has proven to be effective, but the scenarios
presented are normally static so that repeatedly going through them adds
little additional value. The new training, provided through a program
called VirTia Military Training, looks more like a video game, where the
scenarios can be designed to maximize specific skills. In addition to
just combat shooting, the new training includes different types of
drills, such as situations where there may be innocent people or
civilians in the field who should not be harmed. "This allows us to pair
marksmanship with a variety of different training environments where
they are coupled with a strength coach to simulate physical stress,"
said cognitive performance specialist, Jake Blumberg, who oversaw the
training. In addition to using physical exercises to heighten a
soldier's heart rate before the training, an AI watched over everything
that happened during each scenario and evaluated each participant's
responses. The AI was then tasked with modifying the scenarios to
increase the challenge level during future runs if soldiers passed them
too easily, or to assist trainees with specific skills where they needed
more focused help. The Army AI wants you Over in the United Kingdom, one
of the biggest challenges their armed forces are facing today is
recruiting enough young people to join their ranks. There are lots of
reasons for the recruitment shortfall, but one of them is, surprisingly,
the length of time it takes to actually induct someone into service,
even if they are ready to join up right away. The UK recently
consolidated its armed forces recruiting efforts so that, regardless of
which service someone wants to join, they go through the same process.
That has resulted in bottlenecks, and long waits of up to five months
for the entire approval process. By the time the armed forces get around
to even letting a young person know if they can join up or not, almost
half a year has passed since the potential recruit first walked into a
recruiting center, and many of them have already moved on to other jobs
or simply changed their minds. One of the biggest factors behind the
delay is getting medical approvals. According to the British Ministry of
Defense, the medical paperwork that must be studied for a single recruit
can be up to 100 pages or more. And there are other records which also
need to be considered, with many of them existing in varied formats,
including everything from hand-written notes to email and voicemails.
One solution that is being tested to open up the bottleneck is to employ
AI to help speed up the approvals process. In this case, the AI is not
being tasked with directly evaluating if a recruit is able to serve or
not, which would likely raise a bunch of new issues, but instead is
being tasked with streamlining the backend paperwork for humans in the
decision-making process. Under a new system designed by the Capita
consulting firm, a potential new recruit's records, in almost any
format, can now be presented to an AI that will examine them for
accuracy before placing everything into a unified, searchable format.
According to a spokesperson from Capita, "Face-to-face contact and
engagement with serving personnel will always be at the heart of Army
recruitment, but there are parts of the process which have become
quicker, simpler and more effective through the use of artificial
intelligence technology." AI will continue to make military inroads

"**[[blind zones]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [in]{.underline} low-latitude
[regions like the **S**outh **C**hina **S**ea]{.underline}, where
Earth's magnetic field runs nearly parallel to the surface.

When the sensor's optical axis aligns too closely with magnetic field
lines, signals weaken dramatically.

Enter the Coherent Population Trapping (CPT) atomic magnetometer.
[Leveraging **[quantum]{.mark}** interference]{.underline} effects in

energy level shifts caused by magnetic fields -- to
[generate]{.underline} seven microwave [resonance

These frequencies correlate linearly with magnetic field strength,
enabling omnidirectional detection regardless of orientation, according
to the researchers.
