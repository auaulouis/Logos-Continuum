#### Icebreakers enable access to arctic, boost presence and power 

**Lopez 22** -- Todd Lopez is a writer and editor for the United States
Department of Defense (DOD) in Washington, D.C., United States**,** he
writes on the military. (Todd Lopez, "U.S. Needs More Icebreakers for
Arctic", U.S. Department of Defense, 2/8/22,

It\'s true that ice is melting in the Arctic, but this doesn\'t mean the
U.S. no longer needs icebreaker ships to operate in the region. And
right now, the U.S. needs more than what it currently has. The Navy
doesn\'t operate icebreakers, but the Coast Guard does. According to its
website, the Coast Guard currently has only two operational icebreakers
in its fleet.  

\"Strategically, **[icebreakers provide]{.underline}** persistent
**[presence]{.underline}** in a way that\'s **[not met by anything
else]{.underline}** in the maritime region,\" Randy Kee, who serves as
the senior advisor for arctic security affairs with the Ted Stevens
Center for Arctic Security Studies, said. \"Remember, the Arctic is a
maritime region, [and]{.underline} icebreaking [provides]{.underline}
you [year-round access to]{.underline} be able to go [in the
region.\"]{.underline}  

[With ice melting in the Arctic --- but not entirely gone --- **routes
of passage** for shipping are **opening up** there in ways that **have
not existed before**. Additionally, there are ample opportunities for
**commercial fishing** and the **mining of minerals**. By some
estimates, there is as much as **90 billion barrels of oil** yet
untapped in the Arctic.]{.underline}  

U.S. access to the region will [require that all nations operating in
the Arctic play by internationally established rules. But unless the
U.S. can operate freely there --- which will surely require the use of
icebreakers --- it may not be able to participate in the opportunities
opening up or protect its interests. ]{.underline} 

\"You need icebreaking to be able to project year-round presence and
when it\'s \[of\] your time and choosing,\" Kee said during a virtual
panel discussion today with the Atlantic Council.  

Currently, [six new polar icebreakers capable of operating in the Arctic
are authorized for bolstering the Coast Guard\'s icebreaking fleet, Kee
said, adding that the Coast Guard has said they need all six of
them.]{.underline} According to a Coast Guard spokesperson, there are no
plans right now retire to either of the Coast Guard\'s existing
icebreakers. Kee also addressed concerns about the Russian Federation\'s
own \"vast number of icebreakers.\"  

He said that while the Russians do use some of those icebreakers to
maintain a sovereign presence in the Arctic, others are necessary for
running logistics operations in the region, where Russian communities
dot the coast of the Arctic Ocean.  

\"They also use \[them\] for logistics support to their northern
communities, because they don\'t have any other way to get the products
to those communities,\" he said.  

 

### 2ac \-\-- Inherency \-\-- Ice Pact

#### Ice Pact proves intent but nothing is finalized 

**Miline 25 --** Richard Miline is a Nordic and Baltic correspondent
with Financial Times who covers all Nordic countries, was previously
capital markets editor. (Richard Milne, "Finland optimistic of building
icebreakers for US", Financial Times, 6-28-2025,

[Finland is optimistic that it will be able to get around long-standing
regulatory barriers to build icebreakers for the US as part of President
Donald Trump's efforts to beef up its Arctic security presence.
Reko-Antti Suojanen, a former shipbuilding executive who leads
**Finland's co-op**eration with the US **on** **icebreakers**, told the
Financial Times that after many years of fruitless talks, he was
**hopeful of a breakthrough thanks to Trump's interest.** Trump has
bemoaned his country's lack of icebreakers as [geopolitical
competition](https://www.ft.com/content/3471657b-e143-439b-a445-5ab87e3a5c2a)
heats up in the frozen north]{.underline}: the US has just two, while
Russia boasts about 40. The US coastguard currently has three large
icebreakers on order but they are delayed by at least five years and
have run heavily over budget. Under American law, all ships for the navy
and coastguard are required to be built domestically. The previous
icebreaker [made in the US was built in the 1970s]{.underline}. "[While
the President is prioritising shipbuilding in America, immediate
presence in the Arctic is in the best interest of our national security.
We are working with our ally Finland to expedite this process," a White
House official said. Finland is the world's leading manufacturer of
icebreake]{.underline}rs and signed a deal in March to produce one such
vessel for Canada. "Our industry would be very keen to sell new
icebreakers to the United States, as to any other buyer. It's a special
knowhow that we have . . . We are trying to open the gap in a way that
exceptions could be made and [Finnish shipyards **could** **build**
**icebreakers** **for** the **U**nited **S**tates," said
Suojanen.]{.underline} Maritime experts say the US president could issue
a waiver to the ban on constructing navy or coastguard vessels in
foreign shipyards to secure the ships, which would be used to patrol the
Arctic. Trump himself alluded to the ban this week when he discussed
buying icebreakers from Finland and added: "I didn't go to Congress ---
they'll try and impeach me". The US president said that as well as new
icebreakers, he was also discussing buying one currently in service for
Finland. He added that it was "old, like five, six years old" and that
he had offered a third of what Helsinki wanted. "They make them really
good, and they know what they're doing," he added. [Suojanen confirmed
there were discussions about selling a used icebreaker, but said Finland
was not selling Polaris, its newest vessel, built in 2016. "It's the
fastest way to get one. The problem is that Finland does not have
additional icebreakers," he said, adding that Finland had its own
programme for building new icebreakers to replace its existing
fleet]{.underline}, but that this was moving slowly. [Discussions on
purchasing icebreakers from Finland started in Trump's first presidency
from 2017 until 2021 but did not come to fruition. However, Trump's
interest in strengthening America's Arctic security appears stronger in
his second term, including his persistent desire to take control over
Greenland from Nato ally Denmark. The US coastguard intends to order
three medium-sized icebreakers in the near term. On that, Suojanen said:
"If the icebreakers are needed fast, they have to be built in Finland. I
don't think there's a yard in the US at the moment that's able to build
icebreakers quickly."]{.underline}

#### Tokyo sees Trump as opportunity for more cooperation--plan's focus on freedom of navigation is a concession to Japan

**Teraoka 25**- incoming assistant professor of politics at Brandeis
University and Postdoctoral Research Fellow, China and the World Program
at Columbia University Ensuring Trust with Washington (Ayumi Teraoka,
"Strategy of Anchoring: Japan, the United States, and the International
Order under Trump 2.0" July 10, 2025,
<https://online.ucpress.edu/as/article/doi/10.1525/as.2025.2702533/212294>,
University of California Press) //nyasagupta

As part of its anchoring strategy, [**[Japan]{.mark}** will not only
**[continue cultivating its relationship with]{.mark}**]{.underline} all
groups and levels of the [[**Trump** administration]{.underline}]{.mark}
but also [work to wield influence through the US Congress and on the
grassroots level]{.underline}. Thus it will seek to persuade the
American people of the need to sustain its role in the world in terms of
its own concrete benefits. During the Biden years, in anticipation of a
possible transition to a Republican Party--led government, the
[[Japan]{.mark}ese government had [continued to build ties with
Republican s]{.mark}enators and figures [from]{.mark} the [first Trump
]{.mark}]{.underline}administration, especially through former
ambassador to Japan, and now Tennessee senator, Bill Hagerty ([MOFA
2024c](javascript:;)).[1](javascript:;)

In building trust and direct ties with the highest tier of Trump
officials, Japan's inherent pragmatism is already apparent in its
initial approach. [[Japan]{.mark}ese [policymakers]{.mark}]{.underline}
have so far [focused]{.mark} on [quietly [managing and shaping Trump's
policies]{.mark}]{.underline} [[rather]{.underline}
[than]{.underline}]{.mark} pursuing [more [confrontational
approaches]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as retaliatory tariffs. Instead,
as the [[**first country to start trade talks** with the
US]{.underline}]{.mark} in response to the Liberation Day tariff
announcement, the Ishiba government [is likely to [frame issues in terms
that resonate]{.mark} with President [Trump]{.mark}]{.underline}, such
as job creation and economic revitalization, while also advancing
Japan's own strategic interests. Japanese negotiators will also
certainly [leverage Japan's position as the United States' largest
source of foreign direct investment]{.underline} for five consecutive
years and the largest holder of US bonds, making the case that the newly
announced tariffs would undermine Japanese companies' capacity to
further invest in the US ([Nikkei Shimbun 2025b](javascript:;)). Former
prime minister Kishida, who remains politically active and supported
Ishiba for the prime minister's seat, noted in April 2025 that Japan
should "shrewdly negotiate" with the US while keeping in mind that
"their yardstick" is "nothing other than gains or losses for the United
States" ([Nikkei Shimbun 2025d](javascript:;)).

Staying true to its pragmatic tradition, [Japanese policymakers are
likely to de-emphasize "shared values" like democracy and human rights
in bilateral settings with the US]{.underline}, as they may hold less
appeal for officials in the second Trump administration. The State
Department's plan to curtail programs on human rights, war crimes, and
democracy speaks to this point ([Taylor et al. 2025](javascript:;)).
[Rather than challenging Washington]{.underline}'s approach to these
matters, either abroad or at home, [they will **[focus on foundational
principles]{.mark}** such as [freedom of navigation and the rule of law
in]{.mark} the context of [competition with China]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Kishida also warned that "Japan must not be so naïvely honest to lecture
the United States" on values when the US has "no ideals" ([Nikkei
Shimbun 2025d](javascript:;)).

But [[Trump]{.mark}'s unorthodox approach also **[presents opportunities
for Tokyo]{.mark}**]{.underline}, not just risk. Reflecting on their
time dealing with Trump 1.0, the late Abe and Yachi underscored
[President [Trump]{.mark} and his advisors' [willingness to
listen]{.mark} rather than "preach,"]{.underline} which they viewed as a
refreshing contrast to previous US administrations ([Abe et al.
2023](javascript:;), 163; [Yachi 2024](javascript:;), 135). There is
already [a **glimmer of [hope in Trump's ]{.mark}**[unconventional
approach]{.mark}, which may work to Tokyo's advantage]{.underline}. As
Tokyo prepared for negotiations over the tariffs, President Trump made
the unprecedented move of ordering a new review of the Nippon Steel deal
([Kimball 2025](javascript:;)). At the February 2025 summit meeting, the
Japanese side had reportedly brought up this case to Trump, who, as a
presidential candidate, had campaigned against the idea. Although Trump
might only intend to use this as another piece of leverage in trade
negotiations with Japan, his willingness to reconsider his position
[underscores]{.mark} the very quality that Abe and Yachi emphasized: the
[**[benefit of a pragmatic approach to Washington]{.mark}** to take
advantage of the malleability of US policy under Trump.]{.underline}

the [importance of **access**]{.mark} **to the**]{.underline} Southern

related to **climate change**]{.underline}. [[**Aging**

[support]{.mark} continued and [expanded **U.S. research and
technological** **interests**]{.mark}]{.underline}, says the new report.

[[A robust U.S. **research presence**]{.mark} in [these regions]{.mark},
which [are some of the harshest]{.mark} and most remote [places on
Earth]{.mark}, [is essential]{.mark} for **national security** and
economic **interests**,]{.underline} the report says. [[It
identifies]{.mark} three thematic [scientific drivers]{.mark} --- global
**[sea-level]{.mark} [rise]{.mark}**[, the **global carbon cycle**, and
**changing ecosystems**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- and related
high-priority research questions as justification for renewed investment
in vital infrastructure and programs in the near term, especially
construction of a Polar Class 3 Antarctica Research Vessel (ARV).

"[These areas of **scientific research** may be physically far away from
the U.S., but the **effects** of **climate change** on these areas and
their resources are felt close to home,"]{.underline} said Paula
Bontempi, dean of the Graduate School of Oceanography at the University
of Rhode Island, and co-chair of the committee that wrote the report.
"The U.S. is a leader in Antarctic and Southern Ocean research, and we
must make a continued commitment to understanding these large systems
that have national and global impacts."

The urgency of this research is increasing, as Antarctica's ice sheets
may be approaching a dangerous tipping point toward a prolonged period
of ice loss driven by climate change. Antarctica's 58 meters of
sea-level rise potential will have global-scale impacts, yet uncertainty
remains about rates and extent of ice mass loss and the long-term
trajectory of sea-level rise. The Southern Ocean is also where most deep
waters rise to exchange carbon with the atmosphere, and is responsible
for about 40% to 50% of the net removal of fossil fuel derived CO2
emissions. Thus, there is a need for scientists to better understand how
its carbon reservoir may change. The ecosystems in this region are also
uniquely adapted to extreme environments and perform important functions
that regulate the exchange of energy, nutrients, and carbon throughout
the area's food webs. Considerable uncertainty remains about how
ecosystems are responding to a changing climate and may impact important
natural systems that directly or indirectly benefit humans and global
economics.

The National Science Foundation's Office of Polar Programs (OPP) is
charged with supporting Antarctic science and logistical operations.
However, the aging science infrastructure that serves the region will
not be able to support the research necessary to advance U.S. interests.
Without major and immediate investments, including urgent investment in
a new ARV, the U.S. will fall behind other nations in research that is
essential to national security, the report says.

"[[The U.S. is already behind schedule in updating our]{.mark}
scientific infrastructure in the region, **especially** for **[aging
research vessels]{.mark}**]{.underline}," said committee co-chair Alan
Mix, distinguished professor of earth, ocean, and atmospheric sciences
at Oregon State University. "While the committee applauds the tentative
commitment of the U.S. government and NSF toward an ARV, [NSF must
urgently move forward with next steps to make a **new vessel** and other
**needed infrastructure** a reality]{.underline}."

Increased Demand for Icebreakers

The diversity of potential situations in which icebreakers might be
employed must also continue to be considered in acquisition planning. As
of 2020, [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates' [polar icebreakers
conduct]{.mark} **primarily two missions**]{.underline}. [The first is
**[scientific research]{.mark}**,]{.underline} [performed together with
the National Science Foundation and other partners: Understanding polar
environments is [important]{.mark} [in **characterizing global
weather**]{.mark} [and]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[oceanographic
patterns]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [[as well as]{.mark} how these **are**
**changing over time**]{.underline}. [The second mission is
[resupply]{.mark}]{.underline}, primarily [[for **research**]{.mark}
**[stations]{.mark}** in]{.underline} Antarctica but also for [remote
**Alaskan communities**]{.underline}. For example, during the winter of
2011--2012, the medium icebreaker Healy enabled a tanker to deliver
critical fuel supplies to the city of Nome, Alaska. In addition, [these
[cutters]{.mark} have **enabled [presence]{.mark}** and
**[readiness]{.mark}** for possible [polar]{.mark}
**[contingencies]{.mark}**, such as **search-and-rescue
events**]{.underline}; the Healy was present for parts of the Crystal
Serenity's historic transit of a large cruise ship from Seward, Alaska,
to New York through the Northwest Passage with 1,700 passengers and crew
members aboard (Rosen, 2016).

[[All signs point to an]{.mark} increased [demand]{.mark} [for]{.mark}
the Coast Guard's missions in the coming decades]{.underline} and
potentially expanding roles for these cutters. [[**Scientists** need to
**conduct research** on]{.mark} **[polar climate conditions]{.mark}**
[to increase]{.mark} their [understanding of]{.mark} regional influence
on [the]{.mark} [rest of the world.]{.mark} Foreign and domestic
commercial interests will continue to]{.underline} [explore the
polar]{.underline} regions in search of shorter transit times for
vessels; extraction of resources, such as minerals, oil, and fish; and
tourism. Some of this monitoring can be done from the air or via
satellite. For the next several decades, however, [human beings will
still need to actively collect and evaluate samples from the polar
regions]{.underline}. In addition, demand for resupply and even rescue
may grow as the poles become more accessible thanks to reduced summer
ice cover, contributing to increased human activity in the region. As
this occurs, U.S. policy requires the Coast Guard to maintain a
capability to oversee national interests by executing its statutory
missions.

Furthermore, U.S. interests and maritime mission demands in the Arctic
and Antarctic will always differ from each other because of immutable
geographic considerations: The Antarctic is a land mass surrounded by
water, while the Arctic is an ocean surrounded by land, including the
U.S. state of Alaska. The Arctic contains permanent populations, some of
whom have lived there for millennia, as well as resource extraction that
dates back decades. Although the region has some diplomatically managed
maritime boundary disputes, almost all of its lands are unambiguously
part of specific nations. On the other hand, the Antarctic and its
surrounding oceans have no permanent inhabitants and no commercial
activity except fishing and are subject to unrecognized claims by
various nations. The absence of commercial activity may change because
the provisions of the Antarctic Treaty that forbid resource extraction
in the region (Argentina et al., 1961) are open to revision in 2048,
well within the lifetime of future polar icebreakers. If extraction of
oil or minerals led to disaster, U.S. icebreakers might be needed to
help respond[.]{.underline}

[Research in the Arctic Ocean is supported at the present time by a
variety of platforms such as **icebreakers,**]{.underline}
ice-strengthened ships, long-term and short-term ice stations,
autonomous instrumentation, aircraft, submarines, and satellites.
Scientific uses of these platforms were discussed in Chapter 2.

Each research platform has advantages and disadvantages associated with
access to the research area, properties that can be measured, spatial
and temporal sampling capabilities, and cost. For any given scientific
purpose, one platform may be clearly superior. For instance, if the
discussion is limited to proven measurement systems, satellites are best
for measuring the extent of sea ice throughout the entire Arctic on time
scales of days to decades. Autonomous ice buoys are best for measuring
the synoptic patterns of surface air pressure and winds on similar time
scales. Acoustic methods provide the best means for synoptic time-series
measurements of properties that affect sound speed (temperature and
salinity). Submarines are best for rapidly covering the entire ocean
basin, for measuring the large-scale volume and morphology of sea ice
throughout the basin, and for acoustic and gravity surveys. Ice camps
allow long timeseries drifting measurements, while field camps on land
allow long-term studies in particular coastal locations. [**A\[n\]
research icebreaker provides the best opportunity for carrying large
scientific parties** and **instrumentation** to specific locations for
**sampling** or experimentation and for interdisciplinary studies.
Certain tasks, such as large-scale horizontal **towing** (possible in
some ice conditions), **large-scale coring** of shallow sediments, and
processing of **large volumes of seawater and biota, require a research
icebreaker.**]{.underline}

The Polar Icebreaker Market can be segmented by end-users into five
primary categories: Government Agencies, Research Institutions, Shipping
Companies, Energy and Resource Companies, and Tour Operators. Each of
these segments plays a pivotal role in the utilization and demand for
**[icebreakers]{.underline}**, [which serve as **essential vessels** for
**navigation** through **icy waters**]{.underline}. Government Agencies
include national and regional bodies responsible for icebreaker
operations for strategic maritime purposes, search and rescue missions,
and enforcement of sovereign rights over territorial waters in polar
regions. [These **agencies** often invest in **advanced icebreakers** to
enhance national security and **support scientific
missions**.]{.underline} [Research Institutions **utilize icebreakers**
for **scientific research** in **polar environments**, facilitating
**oceanographic studies**, **climate** change **research**, and
**ecological surveys**.]{.underline}

[These institutions depend on icebreakers to **transport researchers**
and **equipment** to **remote locations**]{.underline}, [where
**access** is **otherwise challenging**]{.underline}. Shipping Companies
have a growing interest in icebreakers for facilitating shipping routes
that are becoming more navigable due to climate change, particularly in
the Arctic. These companies seek to shorten transit times and enhance
safety in icy waters. Energy and Resource Companies leverage icebreakers
to access and transport resources like oil and gas in Arctic regions,
where the reliable deployment of icebreakers is crucial for the
development of offshore resources. Tour Operators increasingly use
icebreakers for eco-tourism endeavors, providing unique travel
experiences in polar regions, which adds a recreational angle to the
market. By addressing the needs of these diverse end-users, the Polar
Icebreaker Market reflects a multifaceted demand that is essential for
navigation, research, and resource extraction in harsh environments.

[**[A Finnish icebreaker has conducted an oil spill response]{.mark}**
exercise]{.underline} in the Baltic Sea, testing a new, inbuilt oil
recovery system --- a first for an icebreaker. **[[The
vessel]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Polaris, [**[can collect 1,400 cubic
metres of oil, even in]{.mark}** harsh and **[icy weather]{.mark}**
conditions.]{.underline} The Polaris operates mainly in the Baltic but
can also reach large parts of the Arctic Ocean during the summer months.
The highly automated system opens hatches on each side of the vessel
from which inflatable oil containment booms are deployed. [With the
vessel positioned in the path of an oil spill, these booms can trap
pollutants,]{.underline} pushing them into the hull of the ship. A
skimmer with brushes then separates seawater from the oil, which is
stored in large tanks[. **[Polaris\' icebreaking capabilities mean the
vessel can intervene in oil spills in icy waters]{.underline}**]{.mark},
but the cold brings another set of problems: oil gets thicker at colder
temperatures. So the system is heated, to allow the pumping of oil with
very high viscosity. Increased Arctic shipping, higher spill risk The
Gulf of Finland has some of the densest maritime traffic in Europe, with
Russian oil flowing westwards and container and passenger traffic
sailing between Helsinki and Estonia. \"There is always the possibility
of a collision, due to wind, due to fog\" warns Pasi Jarvelin, the
master of Polaris. \"In the wintertime, if the Gulf of Finland is
frozen, it has to be an icebreaker to go through the ice to a position
where we have the oil spill.\" The ship\'s operator, Arctia Ltd., a
Finnish government-owned enterprise, hopes Baltic expertise in both
icebreaking and oil spill response can inform and educate decisions made
much further north. **[[Shipping is increasing]{.underline}]{.mark}**ly

environmentalists,]{.underline} since the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster off
Alaska killed a quarter of a million seabirds, as well as hundreds of
seals and sea otters. Arctic oil spill response limited, says WWF In
September, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced plans to increase
traffic on the Northern Sea Route connecting Asia to Europe via the
Arctic, from approximately nine million tonnes today to approximately
72.6 million tonnes in less than 10 years. Operating in the Arctic Ocean
remains challenging and dangerous. Vessels face high risks of running
aground in waters which are still poorly charted, and while thick ice
may be retreating, ice floes still present a serious threat to shipping.
[Environmental group WWF warns that **[oil spill response capabilities
in the Arctic remain]{.mark}** very **[limited]{.mark}**]{.underline}
and no comprehensive assessment of the risks has been conducted. \"The
real nightmare scenario is the kind of Exxon Valdez to happen again,\"
said Liisa Rohweder, chair of the WWF Arctic Program. \"That is really
possible because the traffic in the Arctic area in increasing, but
sailing there won\'t be easier than what it is at the moment.\"

**Breaking ice does not cause climate change.**

https://arctic.review/papers/busting-myths-about-icebreakers/

A rounded bow allows for more efficient icebreaking and helps lift the
vessel up under pressure from ice. Broken ice is also directed under the
icebreaker through air and water systems. These and other measures
prevent broken ice from building up around the front of the ship and,
therefore, from slowing it down. [It is also important to stress that
icebreakers traverse ice-laden waters by **breaking ice, not by melting
it**]{.underline}. [The common [misconception that **icebreakers
contribute** to **"global warming"** by **melting ice**]{.mark} could,
therefore[, **not** ]{.mark}**be further from [the]{.mark}
[truth.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Some modern icebreakers also have innovative energy profiles. One of the
most important requirements for an icebreaker is reliability.
Reliability is, in turn, made possible by a powerful engine and
endurance. [The most reliable icebreakers are nuclear-powered, as they
do not require refueling and can operate for long periods of
time.]{.underline} [**Nuclear-powered** icebreakers are also **far more
environmentally friendly** then diesel-fueled ones, as they have **no
carbon dioxide emissions** and carry **no risks of oil
spills.**]{.underline} Today, Russia is the only country that owns and
operates a fleet of nuclear-powered icebreakers; this fleet is
instrumental for the development of the Northern Sea Route (NSR), which
would otherwise be impossible. The country is working to expand this
fleet with new universal models that will be able to operate both in
seas and in estuaries with a simple change of equipment. It is also
developing the world's most powerful icebreaker (project 10510), which
will be able to break through four-metre-thick ice.

**[[Tensions are growing at the top of the world]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
US President Donald Trump wants Greenland, [**Russia is** **modernising
its Arctic military** bases]{.underline}, Chinese icebreakers are
opening new routes and spies are being unmasked. But as the battle for
one of the world's coldest places heats up, an increasingly fragile
security balance may be breaking down, leading to an escalating arms
race. To grasp why the Arctic matters to these superpowers, you need to
look at the world differently -- literally. Forget flat maps -- peer
down on the Arctic from the top of the globe. With this view, it's clear
why the region is considered pivotal - and why the struggle over its
land, sea and sky is accelerating. 'Frontier for deterrence' President
Trump has repeatedly stated his desire to control Greenland. "We need
Greenland for national security purposes," he has said. "I\'ve been told
that for a long time." The question of why a territory with only 56,000
or so people matters comes down to geography. In the Cold War between
the US and Soviet Union, nuclear weapons were the ultimate instruments
of war, holding the balance of terror. And the fastest route for weapons
to reach their targets was over the North Pole. At the dawn of the Cold
War, the US established an important base in the remote North of
Greenland at a place called Thule - recently renamed Pituffik Space
Base, which I visited in 2008. At the base, a huge radar stands like a
giant sentry, scanning the skies and space for anything coming over the
top of the world. As I approached, the car engine began buzzing and the
dashboard controls jumped wildly thanks to its emissions. Inside the
base, US military officers explained how the radar allowed them to see
objects as small as a tennis ball as they moved through space. The Cold
War may be gone but the site's importance has not diminished. It still
forms a crucial part of BMEWS -- America's Ballistic Missile Early
Warning System. President Trump has talked about wanting a Golden Dome
to protect the US, a reference to the Iron Dome that helps protect
Israel from missiles. Early warning sites would be vital for such a
system, with Greenland offering significant potential as a forward
operating base for both defence and offense. "Greenland is an enviable
piece of real estate for Washington, it is basically physical insurance
for the American homeland," explains Dr Elizabeth Buchanan, a former
Australian defence official and author of a forthcoming book on the
territory. "It is no wonder it has always been viewed as a frontier for
deterrence." That will worry Russia, which has long been nervous about
US missile defence undermining its deterrence. But it is also alienating
allies. Greenland is still part of Denmark, where there has been anger
over Washington's acquisitive talk earlier this year. Many in Canada
have also been profoundly shocked by talk of making it the 51st state of
the US, something that Justin Trudeau, who was prime minister at the
time, flatly ruled out. Gaining more control of Greenland is a more
likely ambition, and Europeans are quietly and privately worrying how
Nato -- an alliance designed to defend against Russia - could deal with
a situation when its most powerful member, the US, wants to take
territory from another member, Denmark. 'Potential for escalation' over
the seas [**[Russia is the]{.mark} most important player in the**
region]{.underline}. [A fifth of its territory is in the **Arctic** and
it accounts for more than half of the coastline**. It is the [country
that others worry most about]{.mark}** when it comes to militarising the
Arctic]{.underline}, [but also the country with most to lose from such a
development.]{.underline} Where Western powers largely drew back from
the region until recently, [[Russia has spent years investing in its
presence]{.mark},]{.underline} upgrading airbases like Nagurskoye, which
has been in operation since the Cold War and can now handle large
aircraft in the extreme North[. The Kola Peninsula is where much of
Russia's nuclear submarine fleet is based.]{.underline} Russian
submarines depart bases here to lurk beneath the Arctic ice ready for an
order to launch a strike on their adversary and **[[Moscow sees it as
vital for its deterrent and ability to project
force]{.underline}]{.mark}**. "**[[The Baltic Sea has become less
accessible for Russian military]{.underline}]{.mark}** operations
following Sweden and Finland joining Nato, [[**which means** that **the
Northern Fleet becomes more important**]{.mark},]{.underline}" Vice
Admiral Nils Andreas Stensønes, Chief of the Norwegian Intelligence
service, told me in June. "And there is more reliance on nuclear
deterrence. And [a fair share of their nuclear weapons are in the Kola
Peninsula in the Arctic]{.underline}." Vice Admiral Stensønes says that
Russia sees it as in its own interest to keep tension low in order to
avoid the Arctic becoming more militarised, which would stretch a
Russian military still focused on a war on Ukraine. But [**Russia's
build up,** its desire to project force **and** its **accusations that
Western powers are themselves militarising** the **Arctic are in turn
causing alarm**, and he warns that the "potential for escalation" is
rea]{.underline}l. Norway has tended to focus more on lowering tensions,
but other countries are sounding the alarm. Denmark's most recent
intelligence outlook warned that Russia will "demonstrate its power
through aggressive and threatening behaviour which will carry along with
it a greater risk of escalation than ever before in the Arctic". [The
islands of Svalbard are another place to watch.]{.underline} Under a
treaty, [Norway controls them but]{.underline} other countries,
including [Russia, are allowed to operate there]{.underline}, making
them a potential flash point as [Moscow claims they are being
militarised to pose a threat to it.]{.underline} The UK is not formally
an Arctic power, but its involvement is growing, in part to counter
Russia. One historic reason is something called the GIUK gap, an obscure
but strategically important stretch. To reach the Atlantic easily, the
Russian Northern Fleet need to go through the gap - a narrower body of
water running between Greenland and the UK with Iceland in the middle.
In World War Two, its importance was one of the reasons for the US
establishing a military base in Greenland to deal with Nazi U-boats. In
the Cold War and through to today, this chokepoint remains the place to
look for submarines, and Nato deploys underwater sensors to hunt for
them. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy visited the Arctic in late May
and announced a new joint scheme with Iceland to use AI technology to
monitor "hostile activity" in the region. That means looking for Russian
submarines and boats. However, even though Britain is seeking a greater
role, a recent parliamentary report expressed concerns that the UK had
"insufficient key military assets, such as submarines and maritime
patrol or airborne early warning aircraft, to support an increased focus
in the Arctic". The recent UK Strategic Defence Review promised to
increase the number of submarines but some experts believe more could
still be done. \"The Arctic is a region where US, Canadian and European
security interests clearly and increasingly converge," says Peter
Watkins, a former senior Ministry of Defence official. "As a key
Euro-Atlantic power, the Arctic should attract more of the UK\'s
attention and resources.\" But certain headlines around David Lammy's
visit, such as "Britain's plan to deny Russia control of the Arctic",
could well rile Moscow. Russia may be building up its own presence but
it is highly resistant to others doing the same - it will do what it can
to try and stop that happening. "Russia will seek to deter other
countries from threatening its position in the Arctic, making it highly
likely that Russia will react aggressively to Western military
activities near the Russian Arctic," according to a recent Danish
intelligence report. "[[**Russia is**]{.mark} now **[willing to take
riskier steps in the Arctic and has become more assertive and
confrontational]{.mark},**"]{.underline} the report warned. Power
struggles over 'Polar Silk Road' In the waters of the Arctic, a new
security challenge is also emerging thanks to climate change. This
year's UK Strategic Defence Review said it was likely that the High
North will be ice free each summer by 2040, but some experts believe
this underestimates the speed of change. But this could also lead to
economic competition and tension, especially as new shipping routes open
up. [Roughly a tenth of Russia's economic output comes from the
extraction of natural resources from the Arctic and melting ice will
also serve to make Russia more insecure as it worries about having to
defend more of its Arctic territory from other nations, heightening
militarisation]{.underline}. This is also where China enters the frame.
China has called itself a "near-Arctic" state and, despite being a
considerable distance from the region and lacking any Arctic coastline,
it is becoming increasingly active. That is driven partly by melting ice
opening up the possibility for a new trade route across the North. For
China, a new "Polar Silk Road" offers a new shipping route which is
faster and potentially more secure than using the Suez Canal. As a
result, it has been seeking to project power. In turn that has worried
Washington, whose global competition with China is now stretching into
the Arctic with concerns over influence and resources. "Beijing has used
a hybrid strategy to deepen ties and links to the region from higher
education, scientific missions, environmental cooperation schemes,
international fisheries agreements, to bilateral strategic
partnerships," says Dr Elizabeth Buchanan. "This normalises China's
footprint in the Arctic zone and increasingly makes Beijing a partner of
choice for Arctic states." Beijing has rapidly expanded its already
large fleet of icebreakers and China and Russia have staged a joint
patrol over the Bering Sea near the coast of Alaska. However, Russia is
also deeply nervous of Chinese influence growing in a region it sees as
its backyard. Recent leaked documents from Russia's Security Service,
reported by the New York Times, highlighted Moscow's concerns that
Chinese spies were carrying out espionage in the Arctic using mining
firms and academic research as cover. The Arctic has always been an
important region for intelligence gathering -- primarily what is called
signals intelligence, capturing the communications of other nations from
secret bases located in the region. But other forms of spying are also
on the rise[. **[A]{.mark}** suspected **[Russian deep cover
spy]{.mark}**, posing as a Brazilian academic and specialising in Arctic
issues, [**was arrested in Norway in 2022** **where sightings
of**]{.mark} suspected **[Russian drones have been on the
rise]{.mark}.**]{.underline} One concern is Russian intelligence
interfering in local politics for communities around the Arctic in order
to foster division. And it is not just Russian spies that worry European
countries. In recent months, the US is reported to have stepped up its
intelligence collection efforts on Greenland, a Nato ally owing to
Denmark's membership. This may have been partly to look for signs of
whether Russia and China are trying to covertly extend their influence
on the island, but reports of the activity were met with anger in
Denmark. A US diplomat in Copenhagen was then summoned to a meeting at
the Foreign Ministry in protest. "You cannot spy against an ally,\" the
Danish prime minister has said. For European countries, worries about
rising tensions with Russia - as well as the reliability of their
American partner - are leading to a debate on how they should respond.
"China, [Russia and the US are]{.underline} three [global powers that
meet in the Arctic and we are now seeing pretty sharp competition
here]{.underline}," says Niklas Granholm, Deputy Director of the Swedish
Defence Research Agency. "The rest of us will have to influence and
adapt as best we can." Some nations may favour increased military
co-operation while others may fear this could raise the temperature
further[**. [The mantra]{.mark}** for those who wanted to keep
geopolitics out of the Arctic **[used to be: "High North, low tension".
But that era is passing thanks to]{.mark}**]{.underline} a combination
of melting ice, **[[insecurity]{.underline}]{.mark}** and assertiveness.
And while it may be in no one's interest to militarise the region, that
is precisely what looks to be happening.
